In 1968, at the age of 22 he left McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario to work for a chemical company in Montreal. In 1972, he started his own company (with Raymond Charlebois), PBI/Plastibeton Inc. which he would later sell in 1989 to Shell Oil and Lone Star Industries.

He retired from the mayor's position in April 2017.He owns the licences to many worldwide patents, which supplies him with a significant revenue stream, and this has allowed Trent to devote himself to public service.\nTrent's book about the merger-demerger period in Montreal, The Merger Delusion was published in the fall of 2012 by McGill-Queen's University Press.
