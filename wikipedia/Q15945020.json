He exhibited works during the 1880s. Later he was Moore's biographer, this being an 1892 commission from Montague Marks, editor of Art Amateur. After Moore's death in 1893 he arranged an exhibition, with Walford Graham Robertson, of 100 of Moore's works. He also wrote a biography of Hubert von Herkomer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sgraffito", "response": ["The English artist Heywood Sumner has been identifiedModern mural decoration by Alfred Lys Baldry, 1902 as this era's pioneer of the technique, for example his work at the 1892 St Mary's Church, Sunbury, Surrey.

Walter Sickert: the Complete Writings on Art. Page 84. Oxford University Press, 2000. Scholar Meaghan Clarke ties \"real-life women art journalists\" such as Pennell to the literary figures and hacks that populate George Gissing's  New Grub Street, as well as to the concept of the New Woman. \"Like journalism and, one might argue, because of journalism, the London art world was undergoing an intensive popularization during the 1880s and 1890s.\" Keeping up (as Clarke puts it) \"a peripatetic pace in search of copy\", Pennell went to Paris in May for the art salons, and regularly visited the London galleries (from Cork Street and Bond Street in the fashionable West End to philanthropic art projects in the slums of the East End) to review the exhibitions.  She wrote critically of Walter Besant\u2019s People\u2019s Palace at Mile End (similar in spirit to Samuel and Henrietta Barnett\u2019s St Jude\u2019s at Whitechapel). Kimberly Morse Jones writes that \"Pennell's criticism constitutes a vital component of a wider movement in Victorian criticism that came to be known as the New Art Criticism\", listing Alfred Lys Baldry, D.S.

However, his work reflected a free adaptation of the pagan spirit of classical art, instead of adhering to a strictly historical interpretation. Writing in 1904, art critic Alfred Lys Baldry described Weguelin as \"a painter of classic abstractions.\"", "Weguelin's later work was described by Baldry in The Practice of Water-Colour Painting:It is especially as a painter of the nude figure in water-colour that Mr. J.R. Weguelin has made himself famous. He has taken up a class of subject that comparatively few artists attempt, and he has handled it in a long series of very attractive paintings with a charm and distinction that can be sincerely admired. He has a very pleasing fancy and a delightful sense of style; and his graceful draughtsmanship, his exquisite feeling for delicate harmonies of colour, and his brilliantly direct and expressive brushwork make his productions more than ordinarily important as examples of the judicious application of the water-colour medium. Baldry goes on to discuss Weguelin's principles and techniques.Alfred Lys Baldry, The Practice of Water-Colour Painting: Illustrated by the Work of Modern Artists, Macmillan and Co., Limited, London (1911)."]}, {"page": "Baldry", "response": ["* Alfred Lys Baldry (1858\u20131939), English art critic and painter"]}, {"page": "Alfred Baldry", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Lys Baldry"]}, {"page": "A.
