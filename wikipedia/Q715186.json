He grew up in Scotland, then moved to London to become a professional photographer. He used a photo of Yoko Ono in a book that he published in 1966, and Ono invited him to photograph her exhibit at Indica Gallery. She introduced him to John Lennon, and Lennon invited him to photograph the cover for Abbey Road.

It is the only original UK Beatles album sleeve to show neither the artist name nor the album title on its front cover, which was Kosh's idea, despite EMI claiming the record would not sell without this information. He later explained that \"we didn't need to write the band's name on the cover\u00a0... They were the most famous band in the world\". The front cover was a photograph of the group on a zebra crossing based on ideas that McCartney sketched and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios on Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo while he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which would be used on the album sleeve."]}, {"page": "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)", "response": ["In late October 1971, with not much more than bare-bones melody and half-formed lyrics, Lennon recorded an acoustic guitar demo of \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" in his rooms at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, where he and Ono were living. Ono would receive co-writing credit, but the actual extent of her contribution at this initial stage is unclear since she did not participate in the demo, which was atypical of their collaborations. Another demo of the song was made in late October, after the couple had taken an apartment in Greenwich Village. As with his previous two albums, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine (released in the US just several weeks prior), Lennon brought in Phil Spector to help produce. The first recording session was held the evening of Thursday, 28 October, at the Record Plant studio. After the session musicians \u2013 some of whom had performed at one time or another as members of the Plastic Ono Band \u2013 laid down the basic instrumental backing and overdub tracks, Lennon and Ono added the main vocals. One of the four guitarists present filled in for Klaus Voormann on bass when his flight from Germany was delayed. Ono and the session musicians, including Voormann, recorded the single's B-side, \"Listen, the Snow Is Falling\", the following day. The Harlem Community Choir \u2013 featuring thirty children, most of them four to twelve years of age \u2013 came to the studio on the afternoon of 31 October, to record backing vocals for the counter-melody and sing-along chorus. Photographs for the original sleeve cover were also taken during that session by Iain Macmillan.Badman, pp. 128\u201330."]}, {"page": "1969 in art", "response": ["* August 8 \u2013 Iain Macmillan photographs the cover picture for The Beatles' album Abbey Road in London."]}, {"page": "1938 in art", "response": ["* October 20 \u2013 Iain Macmillan, Scottish photographer (d. 2006)"]}, {"page": "2006 in art", "response": ["*8 May \u2013 Iain Macmillan, Scottish photographer (b.1938)"]}, {"page": "Ian", "response": ["*Iain Macmillan, Scottish photographer, noted for his image of the Beatles walking across Abbey Road"]}, {"page": "University of Westminster", "response": ["* Artists and photographers including Sybil Atteck (Trinidadian painter), Norman Blamey (Ordination, The Lavabo), John Frederick Brill (creator of the Bardia Mural), Fougasse (editor of Punch magazine), Iain Macmillan (photographer of The Beatles' Abbey Road album), Charles Keeping (children's author and lithographer Les Mis\u00e9rables, Beowulf and various works by Charles Dickens) and John Ryan (animator and creator of Captain Pugwash)."]}, {"page": "2006 in Scotland", "response": ["* 8 May \u2013 Iain Macmillan, photographer and author (born 1938)"]}, {"page": "History of Dundee", "response": ["*Iain Macmillan (1938-2006) \u2013 photographer, work including the photograph for The Beatles' album Abbey Road"]}, {"page": "Ian McMillan", "response": ["*Iain Macmillan (1938\u20132006), Scottish photographer"]}, {"page": "Iain MacMillan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Iain Macmillan "]}]}}
