He served in the First World War as a staff officer and then as director-general of military aeronautics and subsequently as controller-general of equipment. In the inter-war years he held command positions in the Middle East, in India and then in Iraq. He served as Chief of the Air Staff in the mid-1930s and in that role he implemented a plan, known as 'Scheme F'.  This scheme implemented an increase in the size of the Royal Air Force to 187 squadrons (five bomber squadrons for every two fighter squadrons, reflecting the dominance of the bomber strategy at the time) within three years to counter the threat from Hitler's Germany. He also broke up the command known as \"Air Defence of Great Britain\" to create RAF Fighter Command, RAF Bomber Command, RAF Coastal Command and RAF Training Command. He then served as Inspector-General of the RAF until his retirement in 1940.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1967", "response": ["** Edward Ellington, British military officer; Marshal of the Royal Air Force (b. 1877)"]}, {"page": "1877", "response": ["* December 30 \u2013 Edward Ellington, British military officer; Marshal of the Royal Air Force (d. 1967)"]}, {"page": "Marshal of the Royal Air Force", "response": ["|1 January 1937||100px||Sir Edward Ellington||1877||1967|| Chief of the Air Staff 1933\u20131937"]}, {"page": "Air vice-marshal", "response": ["| Edward Ellington"]}, {"page": "Air Defence of Great Britain", "response": ["| 1 January 1929 || 5 September 1931 || Air Marshal Sir Edward Ellington"]}, {"page": "Cyril Newall, 1st Baron Newall", "response": ["On 1 September 1937, Newall was appointed as Chief of the Air Staff, the military head of the RAF, in succession to Sir Edward Ellington. The promotion was unexpected; of the prospective candidates mooted for the job, Newall has been widely seen by historians as the least gifted. The most prominent candidate was Hugh Dowding, the head of RAF Fighter Command and senior in rank to Newall by three months, who had been informally told by Ellington in 1936 that he was expected to be appointed as the new Chief of the Air Staff.
