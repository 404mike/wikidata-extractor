From 1979 a stand-out performer in this team was Brian Hooper, a pole-vaulter with an immense will to win. He first came to prominence in the 1979 Superteams final, failing to be able to jump onto a balance beam in the obstacle course event, and by 1982 he had blossomed into a fine, all-round performer.", "By now a professional Superstar (he won $37000 for the 1982 World Championship), Brian Hooper dominated British and International Superstars until he retired in 1984. He beat all of the major British Superstars of his era except Brian Jacks, who had previously retired through injury. Returning to the event age 50 in 2004, Hooper competed ably despite a torn pectoral muscle, finishing fourth against rivals at least 15 years younger than himself. Even now he still won the kayaking and came second in golf, almost making the final, beaten only in the end by an agonising uphill bike race.", "Though Brian Hooper continued to compete in (and dominate) Superstars events until he retired in 1984, he stopped competing in the UK national contest after 1983, and he was succeeded as national champion in 1984 by athlete Garry Cook. The 1983 championship was also notable for the record breaking performances of Des Drummond in the 100m, with the agile Leigh Rugby League player managing to lower the mark down to only 10.85 seconds, in itself a time comparable with many full-time track and field athletes who would compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The final also saw Hooper beat Vic Charles (the only man ever to finish above him in any Superstars competition at that point).", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Hooper", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Hooper", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Hooper", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Hooper", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Brian Hooper", "* Three men each won two European or International Superstars championships: Swedish pole vaulter Kjell Isaksson, Dutch field hockey player Ties Kruize and British judoka Brian Jacks.

He dominated the European competition in 1975 and 1976, defeating the British Superstar David Hemery twice, and scoring 56 points (out of a maximum 80) in the 1975 final. Isaksson was particularly strong in the running events (where he would only be allowed to compete after giving away \"handicaps\" to his rivals) and the gymnasium. He would gain extra points in weightlifting contests by lifting higher weights in proportion to his body weight than his heavier opponents. This gave him a major chance in the 1977 World Championship, though he was hindered by the IAAF disqualifying him from professional athletics competition (and thus the running events).  This was to give his American rival Bob Seagren a major advantage.  Now retired from athletics, Seagren was free to compete in the running events and scored enough points here to beat Isaksson into second place.  Until Brian Hooper won the last World Final in 1982, Isaksson was the most successful European Superstar ever."]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's pole vault", "response": ["This was the 19th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics.

With the contest as much about camaraderie as athletic prowess for many of the competitors however, Ripley's outgoing, larger-than-life persona fitted in very well.
