Charles Dickens called Palmer \"the greatest villain that ever stood in the Old Bailey\".Palmer was convicted for the 1855 murder of his friend John Cook, and was executed in public by hanging the following year. He had poisoned Cook with strychnine and was suspected of poisoning several other people including his brother and his mother-in-law, as well as four of his children who died of \"convulsions\" before their first birthdays. Palmer made large sums of money from the deaths of his wife and brother after collecting on life insurance, and by defrauding his wealthy mother out of thousands of pounds, all of which he lost through gambling on horses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Black comedy", "response": ["* At his public execution, the murderer William Palmer is said to have looked at the trapdoor on the gallows and asked the hangman, \"Are you sure it's safe?\"Witticisms Of 9 Condemned Criminals  at Canongate Press"]}, {"page": "Kate Greenaway", "response": ["As a young child Greenaway's parents taught her at home; later she was sent to various dame schools; she was an avid reader of chapbook versions of fairy tales \u2013 her favourites were \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Cinderella\", and \"Beauty and the Beast\" \u2013 as well as illustrated editions of Shakespeare, writing later that children \"often don\u2019t care a bit about the books people think they will and I think they often like grown-up books \u2013 at least I did.\" Her father's engravings exposed her to weekly news stories, some of which were quite grisly, such as the series of his illustrations for the Illustrated London News in 1856 about murderer William Palmer."]}, {"page": "Old Bailey", "response": ["The court was envisaged as that where only criminals accused of crimes committed in the City and Middlesex were tried.

His first job was assisting at the double hanging of James Owen and George Thomas outside Stafford Gaol on 11 April 1840. He learnt the job and was able to perform executions himself, principally in the Midlands.  Smith's most famous solo execution was that of the Rugeley poisoner, Dr William Palmer for the murder of John Parsons Cook, before a large crowd at Stafford Gaol on 14 June 1856. Smith was to hang a further 14 men and one woman at Stafford, the last in August 1872. He assisted Calcraft at the first private hanging in England (of Thomas Wells see below) in August 1868. He was renowned for his long white coat and top hat which he wore at public hangings. Smith's son, also George, assisted at three executions at Stafford prison. Initially, it is said that he was hired by the Under Sheriff of Staffordshire to save the cost of bringing Calcraft up from London. With the advent of a good rail network, Smith, like Askern and Calcraft, could operate much further afield in later years. George Smith carried out two private executions, the last at Stafford on 13 August 1872, when he hanged 34-year-old Christopher Edwards for the murder of his wife."]}, {"page": "Rugeley", "response": ["===William Palmer===", "In 1855, the town gained notoriety when a local doctor, William Palmer, was accused of murdering an acquaintance, John Parsons Cook (who is buried in a still visible grave in the local St Augustine's churchyard). It was claimed that Cook had been poisoned, and in the months that followed, Palmer was implicated in the deaths of several other persons, including his own wife and brother, and possibly even some of his own children. He was put on trial for the murder of Cook in 1856, and an Act of Parliament was passed to allow the trial to be held at the Old Bailey, London, as it was felt that a fair jury could not be found in Staffordshire. Palmer was found guilty of murder, and hanged publicly outside Stafford Gaol on 14 June 1856.  Local legend has it that, on being instructed to step onto the gallows trap-door, he asked the now-famous question \"Is it safe?\".", "Another tale holds that following the uproar surrounding the discovery of Palmer's activities, the town put in a special request to the Prime Minister requesting that they be permitted to change the name of the town to disassociate themselves from the murders. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister at the time was Lord Palmerston, who agreed to the request only on the condition that the town be named after him. For obvious reasons the locals declined this offer. The story of Palmer was told in The Life and Crimes of William Palmer (1998), starring Keith Allen in the role of the infamous doctor."]}, {"page": "Graham Young", "response": ["He was fascinated from an early age by poisons and their effects.
