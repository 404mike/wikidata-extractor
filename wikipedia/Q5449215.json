They suggested that racing cars were only useful to help develop technology for ordinary cars, and that the cars used in the Gordon Bennett races and similar were no longer relevant. Along with the withdrawal of France and Britain from the Gordon Bennett races, and the amount of support for the Tourist Trophy, they commended the Automobile Club for \"[recognising] the changed conditions of affairs.\" In contrast, Filson Young of The Manchester Guardian was strong in his criticism of the event. He opined that it had been a disappointment, though it had \"never many possibilities as a spectacle\" due to the fact that the cars only passed each point four times during the day. Though he conceded that the concept of the race had been admirable he felt that the cost of fuel was negligible in the running of a motor car and that other factors, such as general reliability over a thousand or more miles, were more important."]}, {"page": "Frank Baker (author)", "response": ["* F.
