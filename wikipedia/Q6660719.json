When Nicole withdrew her consent for the organ removal, Mo ignored her wishes and went ahead with the procedure to save Hattie. Of Mo's decision, Akudolu explained, \"She's not thinking about anyone else's feelings. But Nicole wants her daughter to rest in peace. She thinks Mo and Jonny only cared about Poppy's organs.\" Mo and Jonny argued about the rules that she had broken, with Jonny telling Mo that she could lose her job. In order to portray Jonny's feelings of anger towards Mo, Thomson and Akudolu did not talk to each other in between filming, allowing the atmosphere on set to become hostile. Jonny and Mo eventually made up. While Nicole gained closure when she met Hattie, and Mo comforted her afterwards. In reality, heart recipients do not come into contact with donor families. Akudolu hoped the audience could see the various points of view and did not want the storyline to put people off becoming donors. She told Katy Moon (Inside Soap), \"it's a horrible situation, but Mo just wants to prolong a life in the wake of a sad death.\""]}]}}
