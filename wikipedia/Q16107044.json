Palmer left via the hippie trail for Afghanistan and India, and Williamson and his girlfriend Licorice McKechnie went to Morocco with no firm plans to return. Heron stayed in Edinburgh, playing with a band called Rock Bottom and the Deadbeats. However, when Williamson returned after running out of money, laden with Moroccan instruments (including a gimbri, which was much later eaten by rats), he and Heron reformed the band as a duo.", "1968 was the band's annus mirabilis with the release of their two most-celebrated albums, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter and the double LP Wee Tam and the Big Huge (issued as two separate albums in the US). Hangman's reached the top 5 in the UK album charts soon after its release in March 1968 and was nominated for a Grammy in the US. Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin said his group found their way by playing Hangman's and following the instructions.\"Retying the Knot\", 1997 BBC documentary on ISB A departure from the band's previous albums, the set relied heavily on a more layered production, with imaginative use of the then new multitrack recording techniques. The album featured a series of vividly dreamlike Williamson songs, such as \"The Minotaur's Song\", a surreal music-hall parody told from the point of view of the mythical beast, and its centrepiece was Heron's \"A Very Cellular Song\", a 13-minute reflection on life, love and amoebas, its complex structure incorporating a Bahamian spiritual (\"I Bid You Goodnight\"). Williamson and Heron in this album had added their girlfriends, Licorice McKechnie and Rose Simpson, to the band to contribute additional vocals and various instruments, including organ, guitar and percussion. Despite their initially rudimentary skills, Simpson swiftly became a proficient bass guitarist, and some of McKechnie's songs were recorded by the band.", "In 1994 Rose Simpson, a former member of the band, became Mayoress of Aberystwyth. In 2003 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, who had previously chosen \"The Hedgehog's Song\" when he appeared on Desert Island Discs, wrote a foreword for a full-length book about the band, describing them as \"holy\".

In late 1966, Williamson returned from leave, in which time he ventured to Morocco with his then-girlfriend, Licorice McKechnie. With his arrival, Williamson brought back a wide variety of exotic instruments of African and Middle Eastern origin. Mike Heron, as well, had begun to broaden his musical horizons by experimenting with the sitar in Williamson's absence. Williamson reformed the ISB with Heron, but not with founding member, Palmer, who was still travelling in Afghanistan. As a duo, the two rehearsed early versions of the material that configured their second album. Crudely recorded on a tape recorder and a single microphone, rehearsals took place in Balmore between October 1966 and February 1967, in a period that was charged by extensive discussions between Williamson, and Heron over the instrumental arrangements of the new material.", "* Licorice McKechnie - vocals, percussion"]}, {"page": "The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter", "response": ["The album's cover art \u2013 which on original LP issues was the back cover, as the front showed just Williamson and Heron \u2013 consists of a photograph taken on Christmas Day 1967.
