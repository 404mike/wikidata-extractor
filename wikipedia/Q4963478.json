He had been taking precautions to avoid such an incident since coming to Dublin only two weeks before. Among the measures he employed was to vary his route many times a week but, at a vulnerable spot on the road connecting his residence to the main road, there was only a choice between left or right. He chose right, and approximately 150 yards from the residence, hit a landmine that was later judged to contain hundreds of pounds of explosives. Ewart-Biggs and fellow passenger and civil servant Judith Cooke (aged 26) were killed. Driver Brian O'Driscoll and third passenger Brian Cubbon (the highest-ranking civil servant in Northern Ireland at the time) were injured."]}, {"page": "Bury Grammar School", "response": ["| Brian Cubbon"]}, {"page": "July 1976", "response": ["*A bomb placed by the Irish Republican Army killed Christopher Ewart-Biggs, the British Ambassador to Ireland, as well as his secretary, Judith Cooke.\"Britain's Envoy in Dublin Killed by Mine\", by Bernard Weinraub, The New York Times, July 22, 1976, p. 1 Ewart-Biggs had been picked up at the British ambassador's official residence on the south outskirts of Dublin and was  from home when the vehicle ran over the mine packed with at least  of explosives at 9:32 in the morning.
