He worked there on Black Arrow, making important contributions to the fuel pump system.Later he helped to form, and worked at, Reaction Engines Limited until he retired in 2011.Scott-Scott married Pauline W. A. Cullen in 1955; they had two daughters and a son.\nHe was the Chairman of the Coventry Branch, Rolls-Royce Heritage Trust from November 2000 until May 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Aerospace HOTOL", "response": ["Thus, the project had soon become a joint venture between BAe and Rolls-Royce, led by John Scott-Scott and Dr Bob Parkinson.Moxon 1986, p. 38. Early on, there was an ambition to 'Europeanise' the project and to involve other nations in its development and manufacture as it was recognised that an estimated \u00a34 billion would be needed to fund full-scale development. In August 1984, BAe unveiled a public display of the HOTOL satellite launcher project and released details on its proposed operations.", "In 1989, HOTOL co-creator Alan Bond and engineers John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill formed Reaction Engines Limited (REL) which has since been working on a new air-breathing engine, SABRE, which used alternative designs to work around (and improve upon) the Rolls-Royce patents, and the Skylon vehicle intended to solve the problems of HOTOL. They first published these engine and spacecraft concepts in 1993, and have since been developing the core technologies, particularly the engine and its frost-controlled pre-cooler; initially supported by private funding, but latterly with support from the European Space Agency, the British National Space Centre, the United Kingdom Space Agency, BAe, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.  REL plan to demonstrate a flight-ready pre-cooler operating under simulated flight conditions in 2018, and statically test a demonstration engine core in 2020."]}, {"page": "Skylon (spacecraft)", "response": ["Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, along with John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to establish their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue the development of a viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, Reaction publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight."]}, {"page": "Alan Bond (engineer)", "response": ["In 1989, he formed Reaction Engines Limited (REL) with fellow rocket engineers, Richard Varvill and John Scott-Scott. REL is developing a single-stage orbital space plane Skylon, and other advanced vehicles including the Reaction Engines LAPCAT A2 hypersonic airliner concept as part of the European LAPCAT programme. The projects have involved the practical development of hydrogen fuelled, pre-cooled air breathing rocket engines, most notably, an engine called SABRE (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) as well as the Scimitar and STERN engines.", "The work of Bond and his colleagues Richard Varvill and John Scott-Scott on the development of the HOTOL and SKYLON space planes was chronicled in a 50-minute TV documentary, The Three Rocketeers, first broadcast on BBC Four on 12 Sept 2012.BBC Four: The Three Rocketeers, retrieved 14 September 2012"]}, {"page": "Reaction Engines", "response": ["Reaction Engines was founded in 1989 by Alan Bond (lead engineer on the British Interplanetary Society's Project Daedalus) and Richard Varvill and John Scott-Scott (the two principal Rolls-Royce engineers from the RB545 engine project).
