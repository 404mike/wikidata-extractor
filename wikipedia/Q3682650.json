He was the incumbent (vicar) of the parish church of St Hugh, Lewsey Luton, Bedfordshire, at the time, and during a period of four years immense changes took place there.In 1974 he wrote a book about these experiences, called When the Spirit Comes, one of a number of books he authored during the 1970s. At the start of 1976, having resigned as the incumbent of St Hugh's, he and his family plus two parishioners moved to a house owned by Fountain Trust (an international trust involved in Christian renewal) in East Molesey, Surrey. From this base he began an itinerant ministry travelling nationally and internationally, with his living costs arising solely from donations (living on faith).By the early 1980s Urquhart was becoming more widely known internationally as a writer, and as a speaker at Charismatic conferences, rallies, and conventions. He was involved with Kingdom Faith Church based in Horsham, Sussex, England, where he lived with his wife Caroline, after being a leader of this organisation for many years. In the eighties he spoke at some of the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International Conventions in Mumbai, India, based on the theme, \"Go in my name\" and \"If my people\" in India.\nSome people present at the meetings claim to have seen supernatural healings or to have been healed themselves.As of 2014, Colin's son, Clive Urquhart, leads Kingdom Faith Church with his wife Jane; and Colin's daughter, Claire Morton leads GoChurch Manchester in Greater Manchester, Lancashire with her husband Alan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christian right", "response": ["In Northern Ireland, Ian Paisley led a Protestant fundamentalist party, the Democratic Unionist Party, which had a considerable influence on the province's culture.Andrew Vincent, Modern Political Ideologies.

Latter Rain.University of Virginia, 2001  Manifestations of the kind associated with the Toronto Blessing were also recorded in Colin Urquhart's earlier book, \"When The Spirit Comes,\" which appeared during the 1970s and chronicled the renewals which occurred at the church in Luton, England where Urquhart was, for a time, incumbent. The phenomena associated with the charismatic renewal have been championed by such clergy as Urquhart and David Watson in Britain, as well as by countless preachers worldwide, but have also been criticized as dehumanizing and as being rooted in extreme aesthetic reactions to religious stimuli.Cupitt, Don.
