She was best known for her role as the \"tart with a heart\" hairdresser Vera Downend on the soap opera Crossroads, a role she played from 1970 to 1977.\nGladstone started her television career in ITV Play of the Week in 1964. She moved on to a permanent part on the series Dixon of Dock Green. She also appeared in 'The Baron' as a revolutionary in 'Evening of Hunter', with future 'Crossroads' star Sue Lloyd, in her role on Crossroads that was most enduring. Gladstone started on the series in June 1970, playing an experienced hairdresser setting up a salon business in the Crossroads Motel. Despite a rough veneer and bad choices, Gladstone's character, Vera Downend, was essentially a \"positive\" character and developed favourable fan reaction. Gladstone was signed to a contract, which she kept until her departure in October 1977.\nGladstone's most famous role would also be her last on television. She died in London in 2002 at the age of 65.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dixon of Dock Green", "response": ["| Zeph Gladstone || WPC Liz Harris || 1964\u20131965 || 11 || 20"]}, {"page": "Crossroads (British TV series)", "response": ["The show had several characters in its early years.

His fans included British troops serving in the Falklands War in 1982, who nicknamed the Falkland Islanders \"Bennies\" after the character.New Statesman, Volume 105, page 15 Instructed to stop using the name, the troops came up with \"Stills\" for locals - because they were \"still Bennies\".The New Yorker, Volume 69, Issues 36-39, page 87"]}, {"page": "List of Crossroads characters", "response": ["|Zeph Gladstone"]}, {"page": "Zeph", "response": ["* Zeph Gladstone (1937\u20132002), British television actress"]}]}}
