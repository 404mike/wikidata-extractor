For his own instrument, he composed a cello concerto, Three Pieces for Solo Cello and Variations for Cello Solo. He has written string quartets and compositions which juxtapose a quartet with a solo instrument, including Piccolo Quintet, Bassoon Quintet and Rhapsodie Macabre. He has set poetry for speaking voice and cello, such as Der Handschuh, and has written song cycles. His compositions reflect the individual capacity and character of players and instruments, from piccolo to contrabassoon.\nSince 1998, Waterhouse has organised a concert series at the Gasteig in Munich, often playing with members of the Munich Philharmonic. His works have been performed internationally and were recorded. He has been awarded prizes for several of his compositions, and has been composer in residence at institutions in European countries. He achieved a PhD from the University of Birmingham in 2018. From 2020, his compositions have been published by Schott.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Epitaph", "response": ["In a more figurative sense, the term may be used for music composed in memory of the deceased.
