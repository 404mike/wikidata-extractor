Born in Britain, Sacks received his medical degree from The Queen's College, Oxford in 1960, before moving to the United States, where he spent most of his career. He then interned at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco and completed his residency in neurology and neuropathology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). After a fellowship at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he served as neurologist at Beth Abraham Hospital's chronic-care facility in the Bronx, where he worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness encephalitis lethargica, who had been unable to move on their own for decades. His treatment of those patients became the basis of his 1973 book Awakenings, which was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film in 1990, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.\nHis numerous other best-selling books were mostly collections of case studies of people, including himself, with neurological disorders. He also published hundreds of articles (both peer-reviewed scientific articles and articles for a general audience), not only about neurological disorders but also insightful book reviews and articles about the history of science, natural history, and nature. His writings have been featured in a wide range of media; The New York Times called him a \"poet laureate of contemporary medicine,\" and \"one of the great clinical writers of the 20th century\". His books include a wealth of narrative detail about his experiences with his patients and his own experiences, and how patients and he coped with their conditions, often illuminating how the normal brain deals with perception, memory, and individuality.  In addition to the information content, the beauty of his writing style is especially treasured by many of his readers. He and his book Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain were the subject of \"Musical Minds,\" an episode of the PBS series Nova.\nSacks was awarded a CBE for services to medicine in the 2008 Birthday Honours.He once stated that the brain is the \"most incredible thing in the universe\". He became widely known for writing best-selling case histories about both his patients' and his own disorders and unusual experiences, with some of his books adapted for plays by major playwrights, feature films, animated short films, opera, dance, fine art, and musical works in the classical genre.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 30", "response": ["*  2015   \u2013 Oliver Sacks, English-American neurologist, author, and academic (b. 1933)"]}, {"page": "Catatonia", "response": ["* Awakenings (1990 biopic about catatonic patients, based on Oliver Sacks's book of the same name)"]}, {"page": "Freeman Dyson", "response": ["In 1947 Dyson published two papers in number theory.

Looking over most of his filmography, one writer was \"struck by the breadth\" and radical diversity of most roles Williams portrayed. In 1989, Williams played a private-school English teacher in Dead Poets Society, which included a final, emotional scene that some critics said \"inspired a generation\" and became a part of pop culture. Similarly, his performance as a therapist in Good Will Hunting (1997) deeply affected even some real therapists. In Awakenings (1990), Williams plays a doctor modeled after Oliver Sacks, who wrote the book on which the film is based. Sacks later said the way the actor's mind worked was a \"form of genius\". In 1991, he played an adult Peter Pan in the film Hook, although he had said he would have to lose 25 pounds for the role.Rolling Stone, February 21, 1991 p. 26. Terry Gilliam, who directed Williams in two of his films, The Fisher King (1991) and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), said in 1992 that Williams had the ability to \"go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable...
