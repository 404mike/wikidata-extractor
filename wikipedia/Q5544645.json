Early in his career he broke his ribs and backbone, but learned the tricks of the trade, such as interlinking arms with opposition players to prevent them from jumping. Billy Horner compared him with Malcolm Poskett, and stated the only quality missing in Houchen's game was aggression. Horner and his coaching team of George Smith and Willie Maddren taught Houchen how to protect himself from the highly physical centre-halves that dominated the division, and the youngster learned how to hold the ball up and bring other players into the attack."]}, {"page": "George Smith (footballer born 1936)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Smith (footballer, born 1936)"]}]}}
