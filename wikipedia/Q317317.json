Despite this, Parnaby made 16 appearances for the club. Middlesbrough won the 2003\u201304 League Cup, and despite not making the squad for the final, he appeared in the earlier rounds.

After the match, he said it was the most memorable day of his life. It was not until 1 February 2006 that he made another appearance, again as a late replacement in a 3\u20130 win over Newcastle United. Eleven days later he made his first start, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3\u20132 win over Charlton Athletic. His first goal came on 19 February, heading in a last-minute corner to earn a 1\u20131 draw away to Aston Villa in the fifth round of the FA Cup.

Richards swore on live national television when interviewed after the game, later reflecting that \"I won the Premier League and played for England but it seems everyone always remembers me best for swearing live on BBC One on a Sunday afternoon\". Following this game, he then received a handful of first team football for the remaining matches of the 2005\u201306 season.

At the start of the 2006\u201307 season, Richards helped the side keep two clean sheets between 23 August 2006 and 26 August 2006. However, during a 1\u20130 loss against Reading on 11 September 2006, he was criticised by Pearce after reacting furiously when he was substituted in the 60th minute and threw his shirt to the ground and waved his arms in disgust. Despite this, Richards continued to remain in the first team for the side and was praised once again by Manager Pearce for his professionalism. At one point during the 2006\u201307 season, he played in a central midfield position, due to limit of midfielders. Richards then scored his first goal of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw against Everton on 30 September 2006. He appeared in every match until he was dropped in December, due to a leg injury following a 2\u20131 loss against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 December 2006. But he made his return from injury, starting the whole game, in a 1\u20130 win over Sheffield United on 26 December 2006. In a follow\u2013up match against West Ham United, Richards kept another clean sheet, in a 1\u20130 win. Over the next months, he competed with Hatem Trabelsi and Danny Mills over the right\u2013back position. However, Richards suffered a calf injury and had to be substituted during a 2\u20130 win over Middlesbrough on 17 March 2007, resulting in him sidelined for the remaining matches of the season. Despite this, Richards was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. Although he lost out to Cristiano Ronaldo, he was nevertheless awarded the Young Player of the Season by the Official Supporters' Club.
