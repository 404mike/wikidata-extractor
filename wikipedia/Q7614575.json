Tim begins to commit petty crimes such as breaking into the Simpson's house and stealing a computer. He then hides a load of stolen alcopops at the local youth group. Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan) identifies Tim as the culprit but decides to help him avoid being caught by the police. Tim's bad behaviour eventually leads to his expulsion from school, despite his mother works at the local school as a governor. Writers continued to use Jimmy in transforming Tim's character and he is portrayed investing more time trying to correct Tim's wayward behaviour. He offers Tim work delivering pizzas but is shocked to discover he has been overcharging customers for their meal. Jimmy's wife Jackie Corkhill (Sue Jenkins) tries to discourage him from helping Tim anymore.

The attack left him partially deaf. Sinbad struggled to cope with his injuries and left a job interview after his prospective employer treated him in a condescending manner. After being invited to attend a school for deaf children, Sinbad enjoyed his time there and befriended a boy named Andrew. Sinbad also became friends with Andrew's foster mother Barbara, however her other foster son Kevin resented Sinbad's presence. When Sinbad was forced to cancel a day out, Kevin took advantage of Andrew's disappointment and manipulated him into accusing Sinbad of sexual abuse, accusations which Barbara believed. Sinbad was questioned by police and released without charge, but was arrested when child pornography was found on the computer that he was the main user of, the offending pictures having been accidentally downloaded by Tim and Emily Shadwick (Jennifer Ellison). The police would not believe them when they attempted to confess, and as news of the allegations filtered around the Close, several neighbours automatically assumed Sinbad was guilty. Although Mick initially believed Sinbad, seeds of doubt were planted in his mind to the point where he asked his son Leo (Steven Cole) if Sinbad had ever touched him, and Sinbad felt betrayed when he heard about this. Eventually Sinbad's friend Rachel Jordache (Tiffany Chapman) realised that Kevin was, like her, a victim of abuse and talked to him about her own experiences. Kevin confessed that he had made Andrew make up the allegations and told the truth to the police; he had been abused by his birth mother's husband in the past, which his birth mother didn't believe. Although Sinbad's innocence was proven, his neighbours were slow to apologise and Sinbad decided he had no future on the Close. When Barbara asked him if he wanted to move in with her and the boys, he accepted and after saying a fond farewell to Rachel left Brookside Close for a new start."]}, {"page": "List of Game of Thrones characters", "response": ["| Steven Cole || Kovarro ||  ||  || colspan=6 ", "* Kovarro (season 2) portrayed by Steven Cole.
