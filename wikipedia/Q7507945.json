He played as an inside forward.\nWebb was born in Coventry. He gained a good reputation playing in the Birmingham & District League for Stourbridge, Burton United and Wednesbury Old Athletic, and spent a season with Aston Villa, though never progressed beyond the reserves. In April 1911 Webb, described as a \"rotund little schemer\", joined Second Division club Birmingham. He made his debut on the opening day of the 1911\u201312 season, in a 3\u20132 home defeat against Bradford Park Avenue, and kept his place for the next two games, but that was the extent of his career in the Football League.
