The third was Gregory Olsen in October 2005 (Soyuz TMA-7). In February 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts aboard. After this disaster, space tourism on the Russian Soyuz program was temporarily put on hold, because Soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the ISS. After the Shuttle return to service in July 2005, space tourism was resumed. In September 2006, an Iranian American businesswoman named Anousheh Ansari became the fourth space tourist (Soyuz TMA-9).) In April 2007, Charles Simonyi, an American businessman of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks (Soyuz TMA-10). Simonyi became the first repeat space tourist, paying again to fly on Soyuz TMA-14 in March 2009. British-American Richard Garriott became the next space tourist in October 2008 aboard Soyuz TMA-13.Soyuz TMA-13 launches trio on journey to the ISS  11 October 2008 Canadian Guy Lalibert\u00e9 visited the ISS in September 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-16, becoming the last visiting tourist until December 2021. Originally the third member aboard Soyuz TMA-18M should have been the British singer Sarah Brightman as a space tourist, but on May 13, 2015, she announced she had withdrawn from training.Singer Sarah Brightman calls off flight to space station  13 May 2015", "|  Mark Shuttleworth", "Many private space travelers have objected to the term space tourist, often pointing out that their role went beyond that of an observer, since they also carried out scientific experiments in the course of their journey. Richard Garriott additionally emphasized that his training was identical to the requirements of non-Russian Soyuz crew members, and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with NASA are called astronauts. He has said that if the distinction has to be made, he would rather be called \"private astronaut\" than \"tourist\". Mark Shuttleworth described himself as a \"pioneer of commercial space travel\". Gregory Olsen prefers \"private researcher\", and Anousheh Ansari prefers the term \"private space explorer\". Other space enthusiasts object to the term on similar grounds. Rick Tumlinson of the Space Frontier Foundation, for example, has said: \"I hate the word tourist, and I always will ... 'Tourist' is somebody in a flowered shirt with three cameras around his neck.\" Russian cosmonaut Maksim Surayev told the press in 2009 not to describe Guy Lalibert\u00e9 as a tourist: \"It's become fashionable to speak of space tourists.
