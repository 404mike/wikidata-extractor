Minter's games are often arcade style shoot 'em ups which contain titular or in-game references demonstrating his fondness of ruminants (llamas, sheep, camels, etc.). Many of his programs also feature something of a psychedelic element, as in some of the earliest \"light synthesizer\" programs including Trip-a-Tron.\nMinter's works include the music visualisation program Neon (2004) which is built into the Xbox 360 console, and the video games Gridrunner, Attack of the Mutant Camels, Tempest 2000, and Polybius.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 22", "response": ["*1962 \u2013 Jeff Minter, British video game designer and programmerBoule, Pete. \"Jeff Minter, fondateur de Llamasoft \u2013 Interview  .\" Eurogamer. 10 July 2012."]}, {"page": "Atari ST", "response": ["The ST enjoyed success in gaming due to the low cost, fast performance, and colorful graphics.
