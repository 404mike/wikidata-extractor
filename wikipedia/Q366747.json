He was born in Willington, Derbyshire, and grew up in Bournemouth, Dorset. Between 1972- 1982, he rose to fame fronting the bands King Crimson,  U.K. and  Asia. Notable work as a bass guitarist and backing vocalist included brief stints with  Family, Roxy Music, Uriah Heep and Wishbone Ash.Following his time with Uriah Heep, Wetton formed U.K., and later \u2014 after a brief stint in Wishbone Ash \u2014 he was the frontman and principal songwriter of the supergroup Asia, which proved to be his biggest commercial success. Their eponymous debut album sold ten million copies worldwide, and was Billboard magazine's No. 1 album of 1982. He later formed the duo Icon with his Asia band mate (and primary songwriting partner) Geoff Downes, and from the 1990s had a successful solo career, releasing several studio and live albums.\nWetton's early career was as an in-demand bassist, and throughout his life he played bass with many members of the 1970s progressive rock scene, including Yes (Steve Howe, Bill Bruford, Alan White, Billy Sherwood, Peter Banks), Roxy Music (Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzanera) and Genesis (Steve Hackett).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 12", "response": ["*  1949   \u2013 John Wetton, English singer-songwriter, bass player, and producer (d. 2017)"]}, {"page": "King Crimson", "response": ["After a search for a drummer to replace McCulloch, Ian Wallace was secured.

John Wetton was invited to join on bass, but declined to play with Family instead. Rick Kemp (later of Steeleye Span) rehearsed with the band, but declined an offer to formally join. Fripp decided to teach Boz to play bass rather than continue the labored auditions. Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough acoustic guitar to assist him in learning the instrument quickly. Wallace was able to further instruct Burrell in functioning on the instrument in a rhythm section. With a line-up now complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical differences between Fripp and the rest of the group, and the somewhat wild lifestyles of Collins, Wallace and Burrell alienated the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension.", "The third major line-up of King Crimson was radically different from the previous two.
