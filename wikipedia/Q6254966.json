Among his roles was that of Norman Warrender in the 1980s sitcom Just Good Friends.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Railway Children", "response": ["| Dr Forrest || John Le Mesurier || John Stuart || John Ringham || Peter Bromilow || David Bamber || TBC"]}, {"page": "Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em", "response": ["Guest cameo roles were played by actors such as George Baker, James Cossins, Peter Jeffrey, Richard Wilson, Fulton Mackay, Bernard Hepton, Christopher Timothy, George Sewell, Bryan Pringle, Christopher Biggins, Milton Johns, Diane Holland, John Ringham, David Ryall, Gretchen Franklin, Geoffrey Chater, Royston Tickner, Michael Redfern, Babar Bhatti, Norman Chappell, Geoffrey Whitehead, Desmond Llewelyn and Elisabeth Sladen (who, in her autobiography, mentions that she was considered for the role of Betty)."]}, {"page": "Henry VI, Part 2", "response": ["The first television adaptation of the play was in 1960 when the BBC produced a serial entitled An Age of Kings. The show comprised fifteen sixty- and seventy-five-minute episodes which adapted all eight of Shakespeare's sequential history plays. Directed by Michael Hayes and produced by Peter Dews, with a script by Eric Crozier, the production featured Terry Scully as Henry, Mary Morris as Margaret, Jack May as York and John Ringham as Gloucester. The tenth episode, \"The Fall of a Protector\" covers Acts 1, 2 and Act 3, Scene 1, ending with York's soliloquy regarding the fact that he now has troops at his disposal and his revelation of his plans to use Jack Cade to instigate a popular rebellion. The eleventh episode, \"The Rabble from Kent\", presents everything from Act 3, Scene 2 onwards, beginning with the death of Humphrey. With each episode running one hour, a great deal of text was necessarily removed, but aside from truncation, only minor alterations were made to the original. For example, in \"The Fall of a Protector\", Peter Thump does not kill Thomas Horner during the combat; he compels him to confess by sitting on him, and Horner is promptly arrested. In \"The Rabble from Kent\", we see the murder of Gloucester, whereas in the text, it happens off-stage. Also worth noting is that the characters of both George Plantagenet and Edmund, Earl of Rutland are introduced just prior to the Battle of St Albans, whereas in the text, neither character is introduced until 3 Henry VI (Edmund in Act 1, Scene 3; George in Act 2, Scene 2). Additionally, Edmund is played by an adult actor, whereas in the text, he is a child.Patricia Lennox, \"Henry VI: A Television History in Four Parts\", in Thomas A. Pendleton (ed.)

With the TARDIS trapped in a tomb, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) is mistaken for a female reincarnation of the ancient high priest Yetaxa, and assumes her guise and identity. From her new position of power, Barbara sees her chance to bring an end to human sacrifice. She sees the good side of Aztec culture manifested in Autloc (Keith Pyott), the High Priest of Knowledge, and the gruesome side embodied in the High Priest of Sacrifice, Tlotoxl (John Ringham). As a history teacher, she sees how advanced their culture really is and believes that if sacrifice were abolished, they would be spared destruction at the hands of the Spanish. The urgent warnings of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) that Barbara cannot change history fall on deaf ears, much to his fury.", "Keith Pyott was chosen for the role of Autloc, the High Priest of the Aztecs, while Ian Cullen and Margot Van der Burgh played Ixta and Cameca, respectively. Cullen recalled that William Hartnell \"wasn't the friendliest person, but he was trying to remember all those lines\". John Ringham, an old colleague of Crockett, was chosen to play Tlotoxl; for the character, Crockett told Ringham to \"make all the children in the country hate you\". Crockett's secretary June McMullen suggested Walter Randall for the role of Tonila, having met him at a party. Producer Verity Lambert required Randall to shave his face for the role. Martial arts expert David Anderson, who had previously appeared in Marco Polo, was cast as the Captain of the Guard. Anderson also arranged the fight between Ian and Ixta for the second episode, and acted as William Russell's stunt double in the final episode. Lucarotti used Aztec-sounding names for the characters; for example, the character Ixta was derived from the Aztec city Ixtapalapa.", "In 2008, Radio Times reviewer Mark Braxton called The Aztecs one of the best Doctor Who adventures, highlighting Barbara's dilemma about changing history, the art direction, and the \"sense of impending tragedy\"; he noted minor issues, such as the backdrops and unconvincing fight scenes. In 2011, Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club described The Aztecs as \"a classical tragedy infused with just enough hope toward the end to keep it from being unbearably bleak\" and discussed the inability of changing history and the Doctor's only romantic entanglement in the classic series, which he called \"sweet and funny\". In 2013, Ian Berriman of SFX described the serial as \"Jacqueline Hill's finest hour\", but felt that \"the show is stolen by John Ringham as Tlotoxl\". Though mostly positive, Berriman felt that some of the education content was forced and \"it's a shame that much of the dialogue is so fustily formal\". Ian Jane of DVDTalk praised Hill's portrayal of Barbara, though questioned the character's motivations. Digital Spys Morgan Jeffrey named it the tenth best Doctor Who story, praising the script, performances and emotional impact of the serial. Jeffrey summarised the serial as \"quite simply 100 minutes of sensational drama \u2014 it's William Hartnell's finest hour on Doctor Who and one of the show's very best offerings\"."]}, {"page": "Comedy Playhouse", "response": ["The Dobson Doughnut (14 May 1974) starring Milo O'Shea, Bernard Spear, Jo Kendall, Brian Miller, John Ringham and Ken Barker"]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Roland CulverLally BowersValerie WhiteJohn RinghamJohn SavidentSheila GrantHarry LittlewoodSylvia ColeridgePaul GreenhalghPeter Stenson"]}, {"page": "Catweazle", "response": ["*Professors Oscar & Otto Habbleman: John Ringham (episode 8) "]}, {"page": "Casanova (1971 TV serial)", "response": ["*Dr Rasp as John Ringham"]}, {"page": "Pate's Grammar School", "response": ["* John Ringham, character actor"]}, {"page": "Juliet Bravo", "response": ["* John Ringham as Divisional Supt.
