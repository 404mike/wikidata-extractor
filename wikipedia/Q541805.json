He was an ever-present in his first five league campaigns at Anfield, when Liverpool were champions four times and runners-up on the other occasion. However, in 1988\u201389, injuries and illness restricted his first team opportunities and he played 21 times in the league, with Mike Hooper taking his place on the other 17 occasions. However, he was fit to face Everton in the 3\u20132 FA Cup win on 20 May 1989, though six days later he conceded a last minute goal to Arsenal midfielder Michael Thomas on the final day of the league season as the league title was wrenched from Liverpool's grasp and headed to Highbury instead. A month earlier, he played in the FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest which was played at Old Trafford after the original match at Hillsborough was cancelled due to the tragedy that led to 96 fans dying on terracing just behind Grobbelaar's goal.

He was signed for English side Newcastle United in January 1991 by manager Jim Smith for a fee of \u00a3350,000, being one of 23 players signed by Smith in a -year period as manager. Smith left just two months after Srn\u00ed\u010dek's arrival. Under manager Ossie Ardiles, Srn\u00ed\u010dek established himself as Newcastle's first-choice goalkeeper ahead of John Burridge and Tommy Wright. Srn\u00ed\u010dek experienced difficulty in the first 15 games of the 1991\u201392 season, conceding 32 goals in that period including six in a single match against Tranmere Rovers. Ardiles replaced Srn\u00ed\u010dek as goalkeeper with Wright and by February 1992, the club was merely one place from last in the Second Division. This led to Kevin Keegan replacing Ardiles as manager, with the club winning seven of their remaining 16 games, only managing to confirm their future status in the division with an away win against Leicester City on the last day of the season. The club started the 1992\u201393 season in the new Football League First Division, winning all of their first 11 matches. Wright lost his place as goalkeeper to Srn\u00ed\u010dek after 14 games of the season. At the end of the season, Keegan's first full one as manager, the club was promoted to the Premier League with 96 points. 1993 saw the arrival of Mike Hooper from Liverpool, who competed with Srn\u00ed\u010dek for the position of goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "Graham Shaw (footballer, born 1967)", "response": ["Shaw was born in Newcastle-under-Lyme and signed on professional terms for local side Stoke City in June 1985 after progressing through the youth ranks at the Victoria Ground.
