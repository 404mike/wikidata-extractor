A total of 67 first-class matches were played during this period.\nCricket during this period became increasingly similar to the modern game, although bowling remained underarm until the 19th century. The first Laws of Cricket had been established in 1744 and in 1774 a revision of the Laws added Leg before wicket as a mode of dismissal. The third stump was added after 1775.Cricket scorecards became increasingly complete from 1772 onwards and the players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1772 and 1786 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1777 English cricket season", "response": ["* Holness (Kent)"]}]}}
