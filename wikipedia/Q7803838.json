It was also included in Crucefix's second collection, On Whistler Mountain (Sinclair-Stevenson, 1994), opening the book which also contained a second long narrative poem, 'On Whistler Mountain'. This second piece carries the dates New Year 1991 \u2013 New Year 1993 and splices putative personal events with material from the First Gulf War, in particular the 'turkey-shoot' of the US air attack on Iraqi forces on the highway north of Al Jahra. Tony Harrison's poem 'A Cold Coming' (1991) refers to the same incident. Poetry Review thought the book proved Crucefix \"one of the most mature voices of the 1990s\"John Greening, Poetry Review and it was praised by Tim Liardet: \"Crucefix is at his best, bringing physical truths faithfully into an intense focus whilst remaining alive to their more outlandish implications, their capacity for dream-making . . . . tendering poems of love and desire with great delicacy of gesture and movement . . . blending an earthy sensuality with fine cerebral observation\".Tim Liardet, Poetry Wales Alan Brownjohn, writing in The Sunday Times wrote of it as a \"substantial and rewarding collection . . . highly wrought, ambitious, thoughtful\".The Sunday Times, 8 May 1994"]}]}}
