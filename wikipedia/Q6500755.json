It was a legal battle which was to last for twenty years. In 1847 James Blair Oliphant, 10th and last laird of Gask (in the male line) died. In 1848 Laurence Oliphant of Condie obtained a decree of service in absence as heir male to the estate. However his claim was contested as insufficient evidence was provided. In February 1862 the decree of service was reversed and Laurence died very shortly afterwards in May of the same year. The case was continued on behalf of his only son and heir (Laurence James Oliphant, 9th of Condie) who was a minor. The 8th Condie was 55 years old when his son was born (by his third marriage); up until that point, Laurence Oliphant the author (8th Condie's nephew) was the heir male to the Condie estate (after his father, Sir Anthony Oliphant). It was Laurence the author who then found a better claimant (Dutch Oliphants, a father and son) to the Gask inheritance than his cousin the 9th of Condie. In 1867 Laurence James Oliphant, 9th of Condie reached the age of 21 and withdrew from the contest. The Dutch Oliphants were unable to prove their ancestry but had no heirs. An arrangement was created whereby they had the benefit of the Gask inheritance during their lifetimes after which it was to revert to the female line."]}, {"page": "List of Vanity Fair (British magazine) caricatures (1895\u20131899)", "response": ["|1896-04-1515 Apr 1896||Oliphant Col.
