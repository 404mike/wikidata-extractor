The earliest was probably H. \u00d7 nigercors, a cross between H. niger and H. argutifolius (formerly H. lividus subsp. corsicus or H. corsicus, hence the name) first made in 1931. H. \u00d7 sternii, a cross between H. argutifolius and H. lividus, first exhibited in 1947, is named after the celebrated British plantsman Sir Frederick Stern. H. \u00d7 ballardiae (H. niger crossed with H. lividus) and H. \u00d7 ericsmithii (H. niger crossed with H. \u00d7 sternii) similarly commemorate the noted British nursery owners Helen Ballard and Eric Smith. In recent years, Ashwood Nurseries (of Kingswinford in the English Midlands), already well known for its Ashwood Garden Hybrids (H. \u00d7 hybridus singles, semi-doubles, doubles and anemone-centres), has created hybrids between H. niger and H. thibetanus (called H. 'Pink Ice'), and between H. niger and H. vesicarius (called H. 'Briar Rose'). The gardenworthiness of these hybrids has still to be proven."]}, {"page": "Helleborus niger", "response": ["Helleborus niger has also been crossed with H. lividus; the hybrid was known informally as H. \u00d7 nigriliv, but its correct name is H. \u00d7 ballardiae, commemorating Helen Ballard, the plantswoman who first made the cross in the early 1970s."]}, {"page": "Helleborus orientalis", "response": ["The Lenten rose is suited to shaded or part-shaded positions, in soil rich in humus. Cultivated varieties have a wide array of colours. It is hardy in USDA hardiness zones 4\u20139 (down to ). German planters began breeding H. orientalis in the mid-19th century, enhanced by new material from the Caucasus via St Petersburg Botanic Garden. New varieties were soon introduced to the United Kingdom. Interest peaked in the late 19th century, but the genus had fallen out of favour by the 1920s. The Lenten rose was revived in horticulture in the 1960s by Helen Ballard, who bred many new varieties. Cultivated varieties can have white, green, pink to maroon and purple or spotted flowers."]}, {"page": "Peter Wilson (auctioneer)", "response": ["Wilson's father was Sir Mathew Wilson, 4th Baronet of Eshton Hall, Gargrave, Yorkshire. He was educated at Eton College and at New College, Oxford. He married Helen Ballard in 1935 who he had met in Hamburg. They had two sons and she became a noted horticulturist after he became attracted to men. The marriage was dissolved in 1951 and they remained on good terms."]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 1995", "response": ["*Helen Ballard, 87, British horticulturist."]}]}}
