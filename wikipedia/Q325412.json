The band gained national attention when signing with SST, making them the first band from the New York underground to gain such notice. The mainstream music press subsequently began to take notice of the band. Robert Palmer of The New York Times declared that Sonic Youth was \"making the most startlingly original guitar-based music since Jimi Hendrix\" and even People reviewed EVOL, describing the album as the \"aural equivalent of a toxic waste dump.\" The album was later called \"a classic\" by Neil Young.", "Around the same time, the band collaborated with Mike Watt under the alias Ciccone Youth, which was a play on the names Sonic Youth and Ciccone, the birth surname of pop singer Madonna. Sonic Youth released one single in 1986 and one studio album in 1988 under the Ciccone Youth name. The 1986 single, \"Into the Groove(y)\", was a cover of Madonna's \"Into the Groove\" and was preceded by \"Tuff Titty Rap\". The flip side of the record was Watt's cover of Madonna's \"Burning Up\" which had the altered title of \"Burnin' Up\".
