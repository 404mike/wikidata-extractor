Stannard was born in London, England, on 24 December 1931. He currently holds the position of Professor Emeritus of Physics at the Open University. In 1986, he was awarded the Templeton UK Project Award for \"significant contributions to the field of spiritual values; in particular for contributions to greater understanding of science and religion\". He was awarded the OBE for \"contributions to physics, the Open University, and the popularisation of science\" (1998) and the Bragg Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics for \"distinguished contributions to the teaching of physics\" (1999). He was admitted as a Fellow of University College London in 2000.\nStannard is also a sculptor; two of his pieces were until recently on display in the main quadrangle of the Open University site at Milton Keynes.\nIn 2010, he helmed a series of ten short programmes collectively entitled \"Boundaries of the knowable\", dealing with subjects from both scientific and philosophical perspectives, ranging from the nature of consciousness, the nature of matter, space and time, the wave-particle duality of matter, the existence of extra-terrestrial life and infinite universes, whether our universe is eternal, and the question of \"What caused the Big Bang?\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Polkinghorne", "response": ["Richard Dawkins, formerly Professor for Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, writes that the same three names of British scientists who are also sincerely religious crop up with the \"likable familiarity of senior partners in a firm of Dickensian lawyers\": Arthur Peacocke, Russell Stannard, and John Polkinghorne, all of whom have either won the Templeton Prize or are on its board of trustees.  Dawkins writes that he is not so much bewildered by their belief in a cosmic lawgiver, but by their beliefs in the minutiae of Christianity, such as the resurrection and forgiveness of sins, and that such scientists, in Britain and in the US, are the subject of bemused bafflement among their peers. Polkinghorne responded that \"debating with Dawkins is hopeless, because there's no give and take. He doesn't give you an inch. He just says no when you say yes.\" Nicholas Beale writes in Questions of Truth, which he co-authored with Polkinghorne, that he hopes Dawkins will be a bit less baffled once he reads it."]}, {"page": "George Gamow", "response": ["* The New World of Mr Tompkins (1999), coauthor Russell Stannard updated Mr Tompkins in Paperback ( is a hardcover)"]}, {"page": "Open University", "response": ["* Russell Stannard \u2013 physicist"]}, {"page": "Mr Tompkins", "response": ["*George Gamow, Russell Stannard (Editor), Michael Edwards (Illustrator), The New World of Mr Tompkins, Cambridge University Press, 2001 (revised and updated edition), "]}, {"page": "Gifford Lectures", "response": ["*1997\u201398  Russell Stannard  The God Experiment"]}, {"page": "Linslade", "response": ["*Russell Stannard, author of several children's book and books on science and religion, and emeritus professor of physics at the Open University."]}, {"page": "Paul Davies", "response": ["*\"What Happened Before the Big Bang?\" in God for the 21st Century, Russell Stannard ed., Templeton Foundation Press, 2000, "]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 190 || Relativity || Russell Stannard ||  || || physics"]}, {"page": "Thought for the Day", "response": ["* Professor Russell Stannard"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Russell Stannard, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the Open University, winner of the 1999 Bragg Medal"]}, {"page": "R.
