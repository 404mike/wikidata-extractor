The club's financial situation was also dismal, and as the 1988\u201389 season began, the task at Grimsby was to avoid relegation to the Football Conference, avoid expulsion from the FA and avoid going out of business completely. This was achieved, finishing 9th. Following the resignation of Dave Booth in 1986 (to pursue outside business interests) the club had two managers in two years (Mick Lyons and Bobby Roberts). Alan Buckley was appointed after the 1988 relegation and by 1991 had led the club to two successive promotions with the chairman at that time being Peter Furneaux. Grimsby were to remain in football's second flight for six years. Buckley's crop of players consisting of some of the most popular and biggest cult heroes in the club's history; players such as Shaun Cunnington, Keith Alexander, Mark Lever, Dave Gilbert, Steve Livingstone, Paul Futcher, Paul Groves and Clive Mendonca made the club a solid second-tier side (the Second Division became Division One in 1992 upon the creation of the Premier League from the old First Division). In 1992\u201393, Grimsby finished 9th in the new Division One, and until well into April they were in the hunt for a play-off place that would have given them the chance of a third promotion in four years. They dipped to 16th place a year later, though they were never in any real danger of relegation.", "|1973 ||  Dave Booth||\u2013", "|  Dave Booth", "|  Dave Booth"]}, {"page": "Peterborough United F.C.", "response": ["|align=left| Dave Booth", "|align=left| Dave Booth"]}, {"page": "Mahindra United FC", "response": ["* Dave Booth (2003\u20132004), (2009\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "Police Tero F.C.", "response": ["| Dave Booth"]}, {"page": "Booth (surname)", "response": ["* Dave Booth (born 1948), English football coach and former player"]}, {"page": "Ashanti Gold S.C.", "response": ["* Dave Booth (1991\u201394)"]}]}}
