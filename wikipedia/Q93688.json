He was among the most prolific publishers in the history of entomology with more than 250 papers that included seven major revisions and reviews and a highly influential work on the structure and modifications of the male genital structures among the beetle families. He was the editor of the Zoological Record for three decades.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Towcester", "response": ["* David Sharp, FRS born in the town"]}, {"page": "List of coleopterists", "response": ["* David Sharp"]}, {"page": "Harold Maxwell-Lefroy", "response": ["Harold was sent to school in Church Hill House in Crondall where one of his contemporaries, although a boarder unlike Maxwell-Lefroy, was Claude Grahame-White. He was later sent to study in Germany, and after returning to England in 1890 he was sent to Marlborough College where he was in Preshute House under master W.E. Mullins. Oddly he did not join the Natural History Society at school, contemporary members included William Keble Martin, Arthur Hill, and Lawrence C.H. Young (who went to Bombay in 1901 to work in a local business and also contributed to studies of the lepidoptera in the Bombay Natural History Society collections and died young in 1907). He finished school in 1895 and joined King's College, Cambridge, receiving a BA in the natural science tripos with first class in 1898. His specialization in entomology was influenced by David Sharp. He received a master's degree in 1902. ", "In 1903, Maxwell-Lefroy was appointed entomologist to the Government of India (succeeding Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville, who was the first entomologist, appointed in 1901). The appointment may have been influenced by David Sharp. His salary in India was set at 750 rupees a month rising 50 a year to a maximum of 1000 a month. He sailed by the P&O steamer Borneo on 27 March and reached Bombay on 30 April 1903. He was then sent to Calcutta where he was to report to E.P. Stebbing. He married Kathleen on 22 January 1904 in a Catholic wedding at the Cathedral of the Holy Name, Bombay.

Precinctive was coined in 1900 by David Sharp when describing the Hawaiian insects, as he was uncomfortable with the fact that the word 'endemic' is often associated with diseases. 'Precinctive' was first used in botany by Vaughan MacCaughey in Hawaii in 1917."]}, {"page": "Royal Entomological Society", "response": ["* 1887\u20131888: David Sharp"]}, {"page": "William Weekes Fowler", "response": ["Fowler wrote the introductory volume and account of the Cicindelidae and Paussidae of The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma; a contribution to Wytsman's Genera Insectorum on the Languriidae; the sections on Homopterous insects (except the Cicadidae, Fulgoridae, Coccidae and Aleurodidae) for Godman and Salvin's Biologia Centrali-Americana;  and two Catalogues of the British fauna, compiled with A.

After two years of studying classics, he switched to reading Natural History, notwithstanding that he had not studied science at school, having been inspired to make the change by the lectures of Edward Poulton on the colour of insects.  His first publications in natural history journals came when he was still studying classics. He obtained a fourth-class degree in the Animal Morphology specialism of the Natural Sciences course in 1889. In 1891, a committee appointed by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science asked Perkins to investigate the land fauna of the Hawaiian islands, and he was engaged in this for almost ten years, conducting research on the islands and carrying out studies at the University of Cambridge on his trips back home.  The fruits of this research first began to be published in 1899, in Fauna Hawaiiensis (edited by David Sharp), and he completed his work in 1913 with a general introduction to the series.  For this work, he was awarded the Linnean Society's gold medal for eminent services to zoology."]}, {"page": "David Sharp", "response": ["David Sharp or Dave Sharp may refer to:", "*David Sharp (cyclist) (born 1941), American Olympic cyclist", "*David Sharp (entomologist) (1840\u20131922), British entomologist", "*David Sharp (mountaineer) (1972\u20132006), English mountaineer", "*David Sharpe (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|David Sharp||05/06/1890||15 August 1840 \u2013 27 August 1922"]}]}}
