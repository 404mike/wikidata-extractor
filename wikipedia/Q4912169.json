When he signed for the club he was stationed at Aldershot during his national service with the Royal Engineers. He made his debut in 1960, in a Christmas fixture against Ipswich's local rivals Norwich City.He was a regular in the Ipswich team than won the old Division 2 Championship in 1960\u201361 and Division 1 Championship in 1961\u201362. He later captained the team to the old Division 2 Championship in 1967\u201368. In total, Baxter played 459 games for Ipswich during an 11-year stay at Portman Road. However, after a falling-out with manager Bobby Robson, he was sold to Hull City in March 1971. This was an unfortunate end to a fine career with Ipswich as Baxter, who had played initially as a wing-half and later as a centre back was a consistent and loyal member of the squad for many years.After two largely unsuccessful seasons at Hull, Baxter became player-manager of Northampton Town in 1972, lasting one year in the job. He subsequently joined non-league Nuneaton Borough.\nBaxter quit football returning to Scotland where he worked as an engineer for British Telecom.In his later years, Baxter had cancer. He had a leg amputated some time before his death, and succumbed to the disease at a Dunfermline hospital on 25 May 2009, aged 70.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northampton Town F.C.", "response": ["* 1972\u20131973:  Billy Baxter"]}, {"page": "Baxter (name)", "response": ["* Billy Baxter (footballer), Scottish footballer", "* Billy Baxter (motorcyclist), British soldier", "* Billy Baxter (musician), born ca. 1959, an Australian vocalist and later a comedian on Coodabeen Champions", "* Billy Baxter (poker player), American poker player"]}, {"page": "Allan Hunter (footballer)", "response": ["In 2009, Hunter was inaugurated into the Ipswich Town Hall of Fame, along with George Burley, Arnold Muhren and Billy Baxter."]}, {"page": "2009 in association football", "response": ["* 25 May \u2013 Billy Baxter (70), Scottish midfielder/defender"]}, {"page": "List of Ipswich Town F.C. players", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| Billy Baxter"]}, {"page": "Billy Baxter", "response": ["Billy Baxter may refer to:", "*Billy Baxter (motorcyclist) (born  1963), British motorcyclist who set the blind solo world land speed record on a motorbike", "*Billy Baxter (footballer) (1939\u20132009),  Scottish footballer", "*Billy Baxter (poker player) (born 1940), American poker player and sports bettor", "*Billy Baxter (musician) (born c. 1959), Australian radio presenter and musician", "**\"Billy Baxter\" (song), a 1980 song by Paul Kelly & the Dots describing the musician"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 in English football", "response": ["*25 May 2009 \u2013 Billy Baxter, 70, former Ipswich Town defender who spent eleven seasons at Portman Road, and was a member of the side that won the league championship in 1961\u201362.
