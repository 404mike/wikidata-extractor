Hughes remained with Team LNT for that year's Le Mans Series, now driving a GT2-class Panoz Esperante GTLM. The season started poorly, with Hughes, partnered with Robert Bell, retiring from the 1000\u00a0km of Istanbul. The 1000\u00a0km of Spa proved to be equally unsuccessful, with Hughes retiring once more. Following these two races, Hughes competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for Quifel-ASM Team, alongside Miguel Amaral and Miguel \u00c1ngel de Castro, driving a Lola B05/40-AER, but once more without success; retiring due to gearbox failure after 196 laps. His first finish of the season, a tenth class placing, came at the 1000\u00a0km of N\u00fcrburgring, before finishing the season by winning the two remaining events of the season (the 1000\u00a0km of Donington and the 1000\u00a0km of Jarama). These two victories were enough to allow Hughes and Bell's No.81 Panoz to finish third in the championship, one point and one place behind the No.82 Panoz of fellow Team LNT members Tomlinson and Dean, with Team LNT finishing second, one point behind Autorlando Sport."]}, {"page": "2006 Le Mans Series", "response": ["|  Warren Hughes Robert Bell", "|  Robert Bell Warren Hughes", "|  Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of Istanbul", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Warren Hughes Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of Spa", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Warren Hughes Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of N\u00fcrburgring", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Warren Hughes Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "2005 Le Mans Endurance Series", "response": ["|  Darren Turner Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "2006 1000 km of Jarama", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Robert Bell Warren Hughes"]}, {"page": "2007 Le Mans Series", "response": ["|  Robert Bell Allan Simonsen", "|  Robert Bell Gianmaria Bruni", "|  Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "2007 1000 km of Monza", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Robert Bell Allan Simonsen"]}, {"page": "2007 1000 km of Valencia", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Robert Bell Allan Simonsen"]}, {"page": "2007 1000 km of N\u00fcrburgring", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Robert Bell Allan Simonsen"]}, {"page": "British Formula Renault Championship", "response": ["|  Robert Bell", "|  Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "Shane van Gisbergen", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Tim Mullen Robert Bell", "|align=\"left\"|  Robert Bell K\u00e9vin Estre", "|align=\"left\"|  Robert Bell C\u00f4me Ledogar"]}, {"page": "2007 1000 km of Spa", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Robert Bell Allan Simonsen"]}, {"page": "2007 1000 km of Silverstone", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Robert Bell Gianmaria Bruni"]}, {"page": "2007 FIA GT Nogaro 2 Hours", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Robert Bell Andrew Kirkaldy"]}, {"page": "2004 Formula Renault V6 Eurocup", "response": ["| Robert Bell", "|  Robert Bell", "|  Robert Bell", "|align=left|  Robert Bell", "| Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "2007 Mil Milhas Brasil", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Ben Aucott Robert Bell Philipp Peter"]}, {"page": "List of 2007 motorsport champions", "response": ["*:GT2: Robert Bell "]}, {"page": "List of Formula Renault 2.0 champions", "response": ["| style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"|  Danny Watts Robert Bell", "| style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"|  Carl Breeze Robert Bell"]}, {"page": "Aston Martin Racing", "response": ["In 2013 to celebrate the centenary of the marque, the team will be entering two 2013 specification Aston Martin Vantage GTE's in the LMGTE PRO class and two 2012 specification Vantage GTE's in LMGTE AM.
