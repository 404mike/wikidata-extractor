The Saxons went back to \"their eastern home\". Gildas calls the peace a \"grievous divorce with the barbarians\". The price of peace, Higham argues, was a better treaty for the Saxons, giving them the ability to receive tribute from people across the lowlands of Britain. The archaeological evidence agrees with this earlier timescale. In particular, the work of Catherine Hills and Sam Lucy on the evidence of Spong Hill has moved the chronology for the settlement earlier than 450, with a significant number of items now in phases before Bede's date.", "Even so, there is general agreement that the kingdoms of Wessex, Mercia and Northumbria housed significant numbers of Britons.Jean Manco, The Origins of the Anglo-Saxons (2018: Thames & Hudson), pp. 131\u2013139 H\u00e4rke states that \"it is widely accepted that in the north of England, the native population survived to a greater extent than the south,\" and that in Bernicia, \"a small group of immigrants may have replaced the native British elite and took over the kingdom as a going concern.\" Evidence for the natives in Wessex, meanwhile, can be seen in the late seventh century laws of King Ine, which gave them fewer rights and a lower status than the Saxons.Martin Grimmer, \"Britons in Early Wessex: The Evidence of the Law Code of Ine,\" in Britons in Anglo-Saxon England, ed. Nick Higham (2007: Boydell and Brewer) This might have provided an incentive for Britons in the kingdom to adopt Anglo-Saxon culture.

Shashi Jayakumar suggests the rivalry between King Eadwig and his younger brother Edgar in the 950s dates back to the conflict which resulted in the Battle of the Holme. Eadwig's wife, \u00c6lfgifu, was probably \u00c6thelweard's sister, and one of Eadwig's supporters, Byrhtnoth, may have been descended from the Mercian royal family through the \u00e6theling Beorhtnoth, whose son Byrhtsige died fighting on \u00c6thelwold's side at the Holme. Opponents of Eadwig included his grandmother, Eadgifu, and Eadwig confiscated her property. In Jayakumar's view: \"The emergence of \u00c6lfgifu, descendant of the \u00e6theling \u00c6thelwold, did not just threaten Edgar's position, it represented a revanche to a line and lineage with royal claims of its own\u00a0...

In the view of Nick Higham, \u00c6thelweard shows a \"lack of empathy\" for Edward in his chronicle, which Higham attributes to Edward's victory over \u00c6thelweard's ancestor. \u00c6thelweard was Ealdorman of the Western Provinces in the late tenth century, showing that \u00c6thelred's descendants held on to land and power in the century after his death. \u00c6thelweard's grandson, \u00c6thelnoth, was an eleventh-century archbishop of Canterbury."]}, {"page": "History of York", "response": ["Christopher Allen Snyder makes note of the evidence for Eboracum continuing to function, perhaps as a military outpost or the seat of a minor kingdom based on some old territory of the Brigantes.

Nick Higham suggests that the war between Britons and Saxons seems to have ended in some sort of compromise, which conceded a very considerable sphere of influence within Britain to the incomers. Kenneth Dark, on the other hand, has argued for a continuation of British political, cultural and military power well into the latter part of the sixth century, even in the eastern part of the country. Dark's argument rests on the very uneven distribution of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries and the proposition that large gaps in that distribution necessarily represent strong British polities which excluded Anglo-Saxon settlers by force.Dark, K., Civitas to Kingdom: British Political Continuity 300\u201380 (London, Leicester University Press, 1994) p\u00a097\u2013104 Cremation cemeteries in eastern Britain north of the Thames begin during the second quarter of the fifth century,J.
