About 1868 he founded Humber Cycles, the bicycle manufacturing business at Beeston, Nottinghamshire later owned by Humber & Co Limited.\nHumber improved cycle technology through the independence of his thinking and his practical ability.

Racers on Styria bicycles were successful in long-distance road races, most notably Josef Fischer, winner of the first edition of Paris\u2013Roubaix in 1896. At that time, Puch already employed more than 300 workers and sold about 6,000 bicycle per annum."]}, {"page": "Safety bicycle", "response": ["The first bicycle to be called a \"safety\" was designed by the English engineer Harry John Lawson (Henry Lawson) in 1876, although other bicycles which fit the description had been developed earlier, such as by Thomas Humber in 1868. Unlike with penny-farthings, the rider's feet were within reach of the ground, making it easier to stop. The pedals powered the rear wheel, keeping the rider's feet safely away from the front wheel. The original treadle bicycle model used treadles to transfer power to the rear wheel, while the later 1879 model used a chain drive, an important new technology that had previously only been used on tricycles. Lawson's safety failed to catch on, perhaps because of its increased cost, weight and complexity compared to the penny-farthing. One other variation that appeared at about the same time is the dwarf, exemplified by the Kangaroo, and with a chain-driven front wheel."]}, {"page": "Humber Limited", "response": ["Humber Limited was a British manufacturer of bicycles, motorcycles and motor vehicles incorporated and listed on the stock exchange in 1887.
