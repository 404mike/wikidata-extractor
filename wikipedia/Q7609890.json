He wrote classic papers on the birds of the Red Sea, Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Indonesia, Borneo, Ecuador and Iraq.

For a majority of members the receipt of the journal was the only direct contact they had with the RAOU. Yet the content of Emu was being assailed from both the 'scientists' who wanted more rigour and less in-house material, and from the 'amateurs' who disliked the scientific language of many papers. The long-term solution would be to cater separately for both groups. The start of this process came with the decision by the RAOU Council in 1968 to allow for a type of membership without a subscription to Emu. The next step was when Jack Hyett resigned as editor of Emu in 1968, the ACT Branch nominated Stephen Marchant for the editorship, and he was elected unopposed. Marchant was editor for the next twelve years and he transformed Emu into the lean and rigorous journal the 'scientists' wanted."]}, {"page": "2003 in birding and ornithology", "response": ["* ? - Stephen Marchant"]}, {"page": "Marchant", "response": ["* Stephen Marchant (1912\u20132003), Australian geologist and amateur ornithologist", "* Stephen Marchant (actor), Irish actor"]}, {"page": "John Hobbs Medal", "response": ["* 1997 \u2013 Stephen Marchant"]}, {"page": "Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union Fellows", "response": ["*1975 - Stephen Marchant AM (1912-1903)"]}, {"page": "Union Medal of the British Ornithological Union", "response": ["*\t1971 Stephen Marchant, Henry Neville Southern, Bernard Stonehouse"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge", "response": ["*Stephen Marchant \u2013 ornithologist"]}, {"page": "Marchant, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen Marchant"]}]}}
