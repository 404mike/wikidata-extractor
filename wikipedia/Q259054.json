This led to an early scientific method being developed in the Muslim world, where progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) on optics from circa 1000, in his Book of Optics. The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Jim Al-Khalili stated in 2009 that Ibn al-Haytham is 'often referred to as the \"world's first true scientist\".' al-Khwarzimi's invented the log base systems that are being used today, he also contributed theorems in trigonometry as well as limits.Plofker, Kim (2009), Mathematics in India: 500 BCE\u20131800 CE, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. .
