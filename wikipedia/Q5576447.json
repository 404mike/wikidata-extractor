Expectations of King James started high but then declined. By the 1620s, there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of Elizabeth.Somerset, 726. Elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the Protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age. James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court.Strong, 164. The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties,Haigh, 170. was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: \"When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen did seem to revive. Then was her memory much magnified.\" Elizabeth's reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.Dobson and Watson, 257."]}, {"page": "Anne of Denmark", "response": ["In London, Anne adopted a cosmopolitan lifestyle, while James preferred to escape the capital, most often at his hunting lodge in Royston.Stewart, 181. Anne's chaplain, Godfrey Goodman, later summed up the royal relationship: \"The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him uxorious; yet they did love as well as man and wife could do, not conversing together.\"Stewart, 182: 'conversing together' in the now obsolete sense of living together Anne moved into Greenwich Palace and then Somerset House, which she renamed Denmark House. After 1607, she and James rarely lived together,Willson, 403. by which time she had borne seven children and suffered at least three miscarriages.

This publication was to celebrate the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth Stuart to Frederick V of the Palatinate. Gibbons's compositions written around the time of Parthenia include various anthems dedicated to senior nobles and clergy: the pavane Lord Salisbury for Lord Salisbury, the wedding anthem Blessed are all they for the Earl of Somerset, as well as anthems for Godfrey Goodman, William Laud and Anthony Maxey. Such works suggest that he was well associated throughout the court and that he was aiming for a permanent post. Frederick returned to Heidelberg with Elizabeth in 1613 and the couple was accompanied by a vast entourage, including Coperario and the harpist Daniel Callinder. In the list of attendants a \"Gibbons\" is listed which presumably meant Orlando Gibbons, meaning Gibbons spent some time in the capital of the Electoral Palatinate. Gibbons seems to have taken Bull's place, who was in financial jeopardy."]}, {"page": "George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore", "response": ["The connection between Calvert's resignation and his conversion to Roman Catholicism was a complex one. George Cottington, a former employee of Calvert, suggested in 1628 that Calvert's conversion had been in progress a long time before it was made public.Codignola, p. 12. George Abbot (1562\u20131633), the reigning Archbishop of Canterbury (and ecclesiastical head of the independent Church of England), reported that political opposition to Calvert, combined with his loss of office, had \"made him discontented and, as the saying is, \"Desperatio facit monachum\", so hee apparently did turne papist, which hee now professeth, this being the third time that he hath bene to blame that way [sic]\".Krugler, p. 69. Abbot's remark suggests previous wavering on Calvert's part; Krugler speculates that the two previous times \"he had bene to blame that way\" were during his childhood, when his Catholic family was forced to become Protestant, and during the period of distress and doubt Calvert experienced after the death of his wife. Godfrey Goodman, the Bishop of Gloucester, later claimed Calvert had been a secret Catholic all along (\"infinitely addicted to the Catholic faith\"), which explained his support for lenient policies towards Catholics and for the Spanish match.Krugler, p. 70."]}, {"page": "West Ilsley", "response": ["The parish church of All Saints dates back to the 12th century.

His successor, Dr Godfrey Goodman, sheltered King Charles I at West Ilsley Rectory during the English Civil War.
