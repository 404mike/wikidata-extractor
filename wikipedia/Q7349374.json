Having acquired striker Micky Quinn in November 1992 they continued what had already been a blistering start, with away wins at Tottenham Hotspur (2\u20130) Sheffield Wednesday (2\u20131) and Wimbledon (2\u20131) to add to already impressive home wins against Middlesbrough (2\u20131). By the early autumn the Sky Blues briefly topped the inaugural Premier League and would only lose five league games prior to Christmas. The addition of Micky Quinn to the squad led to further outstanding home wins against Aston Villa (3\u20130) and Liverpool (5\u20131). In February 1993, they won 4-2 against title chasing, big spending Blackburn Rovers. However, a barren final few weeks of the season and a run in that would see back to back games against Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds United saw them slip from fifth in the league in February to 15th in the final table. The season finished with a thrilling performance from Ndlovu in a 3\u20133 draw against Leeds United. Ndlovu was a key component throughout the season in Gould's fast pacey front line which included John Williams, Kevin Gallacher (until his departure to Blackburn) and Robert Rosario, who formed a worthy partnership with Micky Quinn. Ndlovu's goal against Norwich City, in a 1\u20131 draw in late September, was a signature piece of Ndlovu flair which earned him the Match of Day 'Goal of the month' competition."]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 in English football", "response": ["22 March 1991 \u2013 Coventry City sign striker Robert Rosario from Norwich City for \u00a3600,000."]}, {"page": "Dale Gordon", "response": ["1986\u201387 was Gordon's breakthrough season.

Robert Fleck scored a 19-minute hat-trick and Allen scored three further goals to give Norwich the largest FA Cup victory in their club's history. Despite the magnitude of the defeat, the Sutton United players performed a lap of honour at the conclusion of the match.

Their one-touch play completely destroyed us. We knew we had to contain them in midfield, but weren't able to.\" Dave Stringer, the Norwich manager, said \"Sutton were a credit to the Vauxhall Conference but we were a credit to the First Division\".

The club's form for the next quarter of the season saw the club rise to fifth with a genuine possibility of challenging for European qualification. However, after the sale of striker Robert Rosario (a key provider for the firepower of the likes of Micky Quinn and Peter Ndlovu) to strugglers Nottingham Forest, another run of 11 games with only one win dragged Coventry to 15th, the lowest place they had occupied all season - finishing only three points above the relegation zone.
