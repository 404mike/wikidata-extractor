He began a friendship with William Harrison Ainsworth, the author of the highwayman novel Rookwood (1834), whose bachelor salon in Harrow Road had become the meeting place for a set that included Daniel Maclise, Benjamin Disraeli, Edward Bulwer-Lytton and George Cruikshank. All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house. The success of Sketches by Boz led to a proposal from publishers Chapman and Hall for Dickens to supply text to match Robert Seymour's engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress. Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment and Dickens, who wanted to write a connected series of sketches, hired \"Phiz\" to provide the engravings (which were reduced from four to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became The Pickwick Papers and, although the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character Sam Weller in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity. The final instalment sold 40,000 copies. On the impact of the character, The Paris Review stated, \"arguably the most historic bump in English publishing is the Sam Weller Bump.\" A publishing phenomenon, John Sutherland called The Pickwick Papers \"[t]he most important single novel of the Victorian era\". The unprecedented success led to numerous spin-offs and merchandise ranging from Pickwick cigars, playing cards, china figurines, Sam Weller puzzles, Weller boot polish and joke books."]}, {"page": "Father Christmas", "response": ["Thomas Hervey's The Book of Christmas (1836), illustrated by Robert Seymour, exemplifies this view.", "File:Mummers, by Robert Seymour, 1836.jpg|alt=Engraving showing a hunchback Old Father Christmas in an 1836 mummers play|A hunchback Old Father Christmas in an 1836 play with long robe, holly wreath and staff."]}, {"page": "1836 in literature", "response": ["*March 31 (dated April) \u2013 The first monthly part of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens is issued in London.

The book became Britain's first real publishing phenomenon, with bootleg copies, theatrical performances, Sam Weller joke books, and other merchandise.

There was to be a club, the members of which were to be sent on hunting and fishing expeditions into the country. Their guns were to go off by accident, and fishhooks were to get caught in their hats and trousers, and these and other misadventures were to be depicted in Seymour's comic plates. They asked Dickens to supply the description necessary to explain the plates and to connect them into a sort of picture novel that was fashionable at the time. He protested that he knew nothing of sport, but still accepted the commission.", "Stephen Jarvis's novel Death and Mr PickwickStephen Jarvis, Death and Mr Pickwick, Jonathan Cape, London, 2014 () (2014) is in part a literary thriller, examining in forensic detail the question of whether the idea, character and physiognomy of Samuel Pickwick originated with Dickens, or with the original illustrator and instigator of the project, Robert Seymour.

Having an almost childlike simplicity, Pickwick is loyal and protective toward his friends but is often hoodwinked by conmen and poseurs; he can be quick to anger when confronted by the actions of tricksters and such as Alfred Jingle; he is always gallant towards women, young and old, but can also be indecisive in his dealings with them. Dicken's develops Pickwick's character as the novel evolved from the original concept of the Pickwick Club, a series of comic \"cockney sporting plates\" by illustrator Robert Seymour.

Who's Who in Dickens, Routledge (1998), pp. 270-71 Thus, the character of Winkle was introduced by Dickens into the Pickwick Papers as a nod to the original sporting theme of the novel as envisioned by Robert Seymour, the original illustrator.

Dorothy George, Hogarth to Cruikshank (London 1967) p. 177 The March of Intellect was repeatedly satirised in written print and visual media, such as cartoons. Cartoons were frequently used in the nineteenth century to explore current affairs and were becoming increasingly accessible during the peak of the March of Intellect. William Heath\u2019s collection of prints published between 1825 and 1829 have become central representations of the debate. Heath used machines, steam-powered vehicles and other forms of technology in his work to mock liberal Whiggish ambitions that problems in society could be solved through widespread education. The scenes present futuristic visions of society whereby issues such as travel, emigration and postal delivery had been conquered by technological innovation through knowledge. They represent some of the advances in everyday life such as faster travel due to the extension of the railway and the rise in exchanging letters. These and other satirical works from the period recognised that a transformation within society was already in motion, but were ambiguous as to whether reform would be progressive or damaging. For example, Robert Seymour's cartoon entitled 'The March of Intellect' (c.1828) in which a giant automaton sweeps away quacks, delayed parliamentary bills and court cases, can be seen as apocalyptic in its attempt to improve society. The March of Intellect remained ambivalent throughout satire, but recurrently criticised the ambition of educating the working class. In Peacock's 1831 novel Crotchet Castle, one character, Dr. Folliott, satirised the \"Steam Intellect Society\" and linked the march explicitly to folly, rural protest and the rise in crime: \"the march of mind...marched in through my back-parlour shutters, and out again with my silver spoons\".Thomas Love Peacock, Nightmare Abbey and Crotchet Castle (London 1947) p. 212-3, and p. 105-6, p. 219 Peacock had earlier parodied the Utilitarian take on the role of the modern poet:M.
