Born into a family with a strong commitment to alleviating poverty, she herself grew up in straitened circumstances owing to the financial failure of her father's businesses. With no formal schooling, she worked from the age of 14 for the welfare of working people.\nHill was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.\nAnother of Hill's concerns was the availability of open spaces for poor people. She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save London's Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from being built on. She was one of the three founders of the National Trust, set up to preserve places of historic interest or natural beauty for the enjoyment of the British public. She was a founder member of the Charity Organisation Society (now the charity Family Action) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work. She was a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws in 1905.\nHill's legacy includes the large holdings of the modern National Trust, several housing projects still run on her lines, a tradition of training for housing managers, and the Octavia Hill Birthplace House established by the Octavia Hill Society at her birthplace in Wisbech.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 13", "response": ["**Florence Nightingale, Octavia Hill  (Lutheran Church)"]}, {"page": "December 3", "response": ["*  1838   \u2013 Octavia Hill, English activist and author (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "May Day", "response": ["Traditional English May Day rites and celebrations include crowning a May Queen and celebrations involving a maypole, around which dancers often circle with ribbons.

She was taken out to dinner by Matthew Arnold who astonished her \"by his knowledge of the neighbouring fishing streams, since he did not personally know the neighbourhood.\" She adds that: \"I enjoyed his talk very much, as I had always had a great admiration for his work and felt it an honour to meet him. He had the stiff rather highbrow Victorian face one knew so well from pictures, but he was delightful to me.\"From One Century to Another, pp.101\u2013102.  George Meredith visited Cloan House in September 1890.

In later life, she corresponded with her niece, Naomi Mitchison (n\u00e9e Haldane) who regarded her suffragist views as being out of date. Haldane accepted \"the restriction of women's activities to the inside, the personal, the domestic\" whereas Mitchison considered women to be equally free to pursuit their lives outside the home.According to Johanna Alberti, in her paper,  She died on 24 December 1937 at St Margaret's Hospital, Auchterarder."]}, {"page": "Environmentalism", "response": ["Systematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to industrialisation, the growth of cities, and worsening air and water pollution. Starting with the formation of the Commons Preservation Society in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. Robert Hunter, solicitor for the society, worked with Hardwicke Rawnsley, Octavia Hill, and John Ruskin to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoiled valleys of Newlands and Ennerdale.
