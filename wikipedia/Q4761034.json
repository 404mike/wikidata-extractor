Since the break-up of the Egyptians, his production credits include Glenn Tilbrook, The Autumns, Sugarplastic, Kimberley Rew, Plainsong, Julian Dawson, Clear, Jazz Passengers with Debbie Harry, Helen Roche; often playing bass and keyboards on the sessions. His guest appearances on albums include David Gray, Nick Harper, Tim Keegan and he was music director and keyboard player for Channel 4's Vic Reeves Big Night Out.\nHe currently plays in Three Minute Tease \u2013 a trio with songwriter Anton Barbeau and fellow Soft Boy/Egyptian drummer Morris Windsor \u2013 and co-produced the band's debut album Three Minute Tease, released in April 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Squeeze (band)", "response": ["The new LP featured complex double-tracked keyboard parts which could not be duplicated by a single keyboard player in a live setting; hence, Jools' brother Christopher Holland, then aged 17, played and toured as a second keyboardist in 1985. Christopher had also played Hammond organ on the album's fourth single \"Heartbreaking World\", which was sung by Jools Holland. However, Christopher Holland's tenure was short-lived, for he had signed to I.R.S. Records and was pursuing a solo career, so he was replaced by an official new member: Andy Metcalfe of The Soft Boys and The Egyptians. A bassist in those groups, Metcalfe played keyboards with Squeeze. His tenure as the band's sixth member lasted until 1988.", "Squeeze's line-up during the mid-1990s changed constantly. Though not an official Squeeze member, Aimee Mann was featured on vocals and guitar at many Squeeze shows during 1994. Thomas also exited the band that year, and Carrack doubled on snare and keyboards for a few gigs before session drummer Andy Newmark was brought in. Then\u2014still in 1994\u2014Carrack left, which allowed keyboardist Andy Metcalfe to return to the band for a short spell, playing on some live dates. Drummer Kevin Wilkinson (no relation to bassist Keith), formerly of The Waterboys and China Crisis, was also added around this time, replacing Newmark. He lasted through the 1995 album Ridiculous, which was recorded by the quartet of Difford, Tilbrook, Wilkinson and Wilkinson. The album spun off three minor hits in the UK: \"This Summer\", \"Electric Trains\" and \"Heaven Knows\". (\"Heaven Knows\" was used as the closing song in the 1995 film Hackers starring Angelina Jolie.) In addition, a minimally remixed version of \"This Summer\" became a No.\u00a032 UK hit in 1996, a year after the original version peaked at No.\u00a036. Despite this, A&M once again dropped Squeeze from their roster in late 1996."]}, {"page": "The Soft Boys", "response": ["The band formed in 1976 in Cambridge, England as Dennis and the Experts comprising Robyn Hitchcock (guitar), Rob Lamb (half-brother of radio host and author Charlie Gillett) guitar, Andy Metcalfe (bass), and Morris Windsor (drums). Alan Davies replaced Lamb after only four gigs late in 1976, and Kimberley Rew eventually replaced Davies. Matthew Seligman replaced Metcalfe in 1979.", "The band broke up in 1981 after Underwater Moonlight. Rew formed the more mainstream pop group Katrina and the Waves, while Hitchcock went on to a prolific career with a similar whimsical, surrealistic style, forming Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians in 1984 with fellow Soft Boys Morris Windsor and Andy Metcalfe, who went on to tour and record for ten years. They were briefly joined by Rew and Seligman in a re-formed Soft Boys for a UK tour in 1994 to mark the release of a box set of their work, and then reformed again in 2001 without Metcalfe for the 20th anniversary of Underwater Moonlight and the release of a new album, Nextdoorland, in 2002.  They disbanded once again in 2003."]}, {"page": "Robyn Hitchcock", "response": ["In 1981, Hitchcock released his solo debut, Black Snake Diamond R\u00f6le, which included instrumental backing by several former Soft Boys. He followed it in 1982 with the generally critically maligned Groovy Decay.The Rough Guide to Rock, Peter Buckley, 2003 Following his solo acoustic album I Often Dream of Trains in 1984, he formed a new band, The Egyptians, comprising former members of the Soft Boys (Andy Metcalfe and Morris Windsor, supplemented at first by early keyboardist Roger Jackson), resulting in their 1985 debut Fegmania!, which featured typically surrealist Hitchcock songs such as \"My Wife and My Dead Wife\" and \"The Man with the Lightbulb Head\". (A live album, Gotta Let This Hen Out!, was released at the end of that year.) Their popularity grew with the 1986 album Element of Light and they were subsequently signed to A&M Records in the U.S. The album Globe of Frogs, released in 1988, further expanded their reach, as the single \"Balloon Man\" became a college radio and MTV hit, followed in 1989 by \"Madonna of the Wasps\" from their Queen Elvis album. In 1989, they also teamed up with Peter Buck of R.E.M. and Peter Holsapple of The dB's, playing two gigs as Nigel and the Crosses, mostly covers."]}, {"page": "Babylon and On", "response": ["Eric \"ET\" Thorngren produced the album, along with Glenn Tilbrook.  The group officially expanded to a sextet with the addition of former Soft Boys member Andy Metcalfe; a bassist in that group, here Metcalfe was used as a second keyboard player (behind Jools Holland).  However, despite being pictured and billed as a full member of the band, the track-by-track musician listings included with this album reveal that Metcalfe only played on three songs: \"Tough Love\", \"The Prisoner\" and \"Some Americans\".  Metcalfe left Squeeze before their next album was recorded, although he worked again with Glenn Tilbrook during his solo years.  The album peaked at number 14 in the UK Albums Chart, the highest ranking there for a Squeeze album, aside from greatest hits compilations, until Cradle to the Grave (2015) reached number 12.", "*Andy Metcalfe \u2013 keyboards (moog, horns, etc.) on 3, 4, 12"]}]}}
