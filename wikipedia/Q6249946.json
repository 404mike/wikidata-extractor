Needing someone to come in to revitalise the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, \"I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are going to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days.\" What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122\u00a0runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up.

That Richie Benaud was content with three pace bowlers and the leg-spin of himself and Bobby Simpson on his home ground signalled that the wicket was not as flat as Trueman thought. Dexter was never a man to favour spinners and was disinclined to include the out-of-form David Allen or Ray Illingworth in the team. John Murray's neatness behind the stumps was finally recognised and he replaced the much criticised Alan Smith as wicket-keeper.  Peter Parfitt was back in the England team as Tom Graveney had picked up a viral infection.pp. 101\u2013102, Moyes and Goodmanpp. 124\u2013125, Swantonpp. 102\u2013103, Titmus", "England batted after Ted Dexter won the toss and he soon came in as David Sheppard edged the ball off Alan Davidson into the hands of Garth McKenzie. He played a subdued innings against Davidson's swing and McKenzie's lift and added 61 in 79 minutes with Geoff Pullar before he was out cutting Richie Benaud to Bill Lawry at short-leg for 32. He was replaced by the in-form Colin Cowdrey who added another 67 with Pullar who constantly looked like getting out, without doing so. He batted over half the day for 53 when he hooked Simpson to Benaud, who took a nice low catch. Ken Barrington and Cowdrey were the most difficult batsmen to dismiss, though Davidson though Dexter was the most difficult to bowl to, and looked set to stay as they took England past 200/3. It was here that the English batting imploded, Cowdrey was caught at the wicket off Simpson for 85, and the part-time spinner had Peter Parfitt was caught by Lawry sitting in his hip-pocket for 0. Benaud now took the overdue new ball and Davidson (4/54) whipped in a couple of in-swingers to trap first Barrington (35) and then John Murray (0) lbw and England were 221/7. The \"Fighting Freds\" Titmus (32) and Trueman (32) saw out the day with a stand of 35, despite Titmus being dropped by Barry Jarman and by Brian Booth in the deep, which they took to 52 the next morning when Simpson got Trueman and Brian Statham with successive balls, but missed his hat-trick and Titmus saw his stumps sent cartwheeling by Davidson to end the innings on 279. Simpson's 5/57 remained his career best Test bowling and Benaud's 1/60 took him to 228 wickets to match Ray Lindwall's Australian record. Another record was the gate, which on the first day produced \u00a312,534 and 5 shillings. The attendance of 54,476 was a new record for a Friday and second only to the Saturday of the Second Test in 1928\u201329 when over 58,000 people saw called some bloke called Don Bradman serving drinks as 12th man. Bradman was now one of the selectors, as was the Australian captain Jack Ryder.pp. 102\u2013104, Moyes and Goodman", "Australia's first wicket cost England dearly. After 32 dull minutes Bill Lawry edged a chance off Len Coldwell (1/41) which John Murray took just off the grass in a dive that tore his shoulder ligaments. Lawry was out for 8, but Murray had to be taken off the field for medical treatment and Peter Parfitt took over behind the stumps (both he and Tom Graveney, who he replaced, were reserve wicket-keepers for their county). He did a reasonable job, but took no catches and few Test teams expect to do well in these circumstances. Norm O'Neill had failed in the number three spot so Neil Harvey came in and was missed in the slips by Cowdrey on 2 and lofted a gentle catch off Fred Trueman to David Sheppard at extra-cover on 37. Sheppard \"saw it all the way into my hands \u2013 and out of them.

He was the first victim of the Cockney off-spinner Fred Titmus (7/79) who in eight overs dismissed Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Norm O'Neill and Brian Booth for 5 runs as Australia slumped from 174/1 to 212/5 by the end of the day. \"Most males in the Australian population knew how to hit Titmus out of the attack but the selectors kept filling the Australian XI with the minority who did not\", his flighty off-spin down the leg-side shackling the batsmen. Harvey was bowled, Simpson was caught off a cut by Ken Barrington for his third Test 90 (and the sixteenth first-class 90 of the season), O'Neill was bowled when he started a drive and changed his mind and Booth prodded one to Trueman at short leg. Barry Jarman came in as a nightwatchman, but was run out for a duck first thing in the morning, overbalancing after pushing the ball to David Sheppard at forward short-leg, who threw down the stumps. Titmus continued his good work, Alan Davidson (15) was caught at short-leg hitting across the line, Richie Benaud (15) was caught and bowled and Garth McKenzie (4) was quickly lbw. Only Barry Shepherd (71 not out) hit out at the bowlers, with 8 fours and a towering six off Titmus, the last scoring stroke of the innings. Brian Statham (1/67) bowled Colin Guest in his only Test innings after a last-wicket stand of 39 and Australia were out for 319, a lead of 40 far behind what was expected or wanted. The wisdom in the press box thought Australia needed to be 150 runs ahead seeing as they would bat last.pp. 105\u2013108, Moyes and Goodmanpp. 112\u2013114, Titmus", "Alan Davidson (5/25) and Bobby Simpson combined to ruin England's reply. Beginning at medium pace 'Davo' was chopped onto the stumps by an awful looking stroke from Geoff Pullar and tormented Ted Dexter, who played and missed his first four balls. Dexter was out, caught in a superb leaping dive by Simpson off the shoulder of his bat and David Sheppard followed a ball and edged it into Simpson's willing hands. Richie Benaud (1/29) brought himself on before tea and Colin Cowdrey became Simpson's third victim to leave England 37/4. Ken Barrington (21) and Peter Parfitt (28) hung until Barrington was bowled by Garth McKenzie (3/26). The England batsmen had now given up making runs and made only 49 from the last 31 overs of the day. Fred Titmus stayed in for 44 minutes for 6 runs until caught by Brian Booth off Norm O'Neill (1/7). John Murray came in with a strapped shoulder and bravely batted out the day to 86/6. He continued the following morning to make 3 not out in 100 minutes with effectively one hand. McKenzie and Davidson sportingly bowled straight to the injured keeper and settled the matter at the other end. McKenzie dismissing Pullar, caught by O'Neill, and Trueman, caught behind by Barry Jarman. Davidson clean bowled Brian Statham and had Len Coldwell lbw and England were out for 104. It was their lowest score at the Sydney Cricket Ground since 1901\u201302 and gave them a lead of only 64.pp. 108\u2013111, Moyes and Goodman", "The Adelaide Oval is traditionally a dull, lifeless wicket with bounce so low that even the fastest bowlers rarely rise it above stump height and batsmen found it difficult to get the ball away. On this occasion frequent light rain helped freshen it up slightly for the pacemen and it resolutely refused to turn. England dropped their injured wicket-keeper John Murray and Alan Smith returned to the team. Tom Graveney was well again and replaced the out of form Peter Parfitt and the off-spinner Ray Illingworth was brought in for the fast-medium bowler Len Coldwell. Once again Fred Trueman advised the opposite, he thought an extra seamer would be better at Adelaide, but was ignored; in any case the spinners struggled on a pitch that refused to turn. Typically the selectors chose the out of form Illingworth over David Allen because of his superior batting. Barry Jarman was also dropped as Australia's first choice keeper Wally Grout was fit to play against after breaking his jaw in November and the paceman Colin Guest was dropped in favour of Ken Mackay in what would be his final Test. Richie Benaud now had 228 Test wickets, Fred Trueman 229 and Brian Statham 235, just one behind Alec Bedser's Test record of 236.

A major part of the MCC tour was flying the flag, promoting cricket and earning revenue for the English counties. All these were fulfilled by playing \"bush games\" against local grade cricket teams and as these sides were roughly the equivalent to Lancashire League they provided the tourists with valuable practice before taking on the state sides and Australia. The local captain David Herbert won the toss and put in the MCC to entertain the 4,888 strong crowd. David Sheppard (45) and Geoff Pullar (102) soon found their feet, adding 95 for the first wicket an hour, when \"The Rev\" was brilliantly caught-and-bowled by Gary Duperouzel. Pullar hit a six and 13 fours in his two-hour century. Ted Dexter was run out for 6, but Ken Barrington (46) and Peter Parfitt (45 not out) added 62 in 40 minutes and Dexter declared on 247/4 an hour before tea. Fred Trueman soon bowled the opener Mucciarone, but Campbell (66) and Sounness (48) added 99 for the second wicket in two and a half hours and Campbell hitting Fred Titmus for six. The stand was broken by Ken Barrington's leg-spin, he caught-and-bowled Sounness just before stumps and had Campbell caught behind first thing in the morning. He took another two wickets to finish with 4/44 and Trueman (4/22) finished the tail with the new ball - taking 3/5 in 7 balls - after Titmus (1/55) and David Allen (1/33) each took a wicket as the Country XI was dismissed for 212. Dexter declined to make a game of it and batted out the second day. The 2,877 spectators were entertained with some big hitting from Barry Knight (40), Trueman (36) and John Murray, who hit 2 sixes and 15 fours in his 102, adding 123 inside an hour with Sheppard (59). The MCC made 314/8 in under three and a half hours and the local spinner Menegola took 4/101 in 14 overs, having been hit for 72 runs off 10 wicketless overs in the first innings.

McMullen later appeared in the middle order, and he soon began to build a promising innings. Before long though a cruel piece of misfortune struck down an English player. Part-time spinner Geoff Pullar bowled a rank long hop to McMullen who hooked viciously at the wayward delivery. Unfortunately the stocky left-hander's bat also connected with...wicketkeeper John Murray, who slumped to the ground holding his face...", "The MCC stopped off on the journey between Melbourne and Sydney to play another Bush game. The local team won the toss and Max Rudd made 82 adding 139 for the first two wickets. Unfortunately John Murray was standing up to the wicket to Geoff Pullar's rare bowling and the future Australian Wallabies international Ken McMullen caught him with the end of his bat while hooking the ball to the boundary. Murray was helped off the field and needed three stitches in his forehead, but reports that his jaw had been broken and that his tour was over were exaggerated. Ted Dexter was the best bowler with 2/29 and Southern New South Wales declared on 186/6 in this one innings, one day game. The MCC made the runs despite losing David Sheppard, Peter Parfitt and Tom Graveney as Geoff Pullar made 81 in 66 minutes and Dexter 108 in 71 minutes with 3 sixes and 13 fours.

David Larter sent the ball flying over the batsmen's heads, but he scatter the ball all over the place. Len Coldwell dug the ball in as well and had a good slower ball, but failed to get the ball to swing. Peter Parfitt removed Des Ball with a diving catch at 10/1, but the rest of the day saw la number of missed chances and Queensland reached 123/2 by the end of the day. Sam Trimble crawled to 95 in six hours, a dismal innings which Johnny Moyes thought \"lacked so much in batsmanship that it did not deserve to go down in the records\".p36, Moyes and Goodman Nevertheless, with Tom Veivers (36), Peter Burge (34) and Graham Bizzell (59) he took the score to 259/5. Even \"Slasher\" Mackay looked good after this and the dour Queenslander started driving the ball through the covers, adding 85 with Des Hughson (26) and 88 with wicket-keeper Wally Grout who hit a swashbuckling 56 with 2 sixes and 6 fours. Mackay made 105 not out, the first century for Queensland vs the MCC since 1950-51 and their 433/7 declared was their highest score against them since the war. Geoff Pullar had the flu and Colin Cowdrey was also resting, so Peter Parfitt opened with David Sheppard saw the tourists through to stumps then took their stand to 101 the next day. Queensland's overseas player was the West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall and earlier on the Monday one of his bouncers rose awkwardly and broke Grout's jaw, he was hurried to hospital and missed the First Test as a result. Hall (0/106) was overbowled on the now flat Woolloongabba wicket and Queensland's best bowler was the leg-spinner Colin Westaway (3/156), which pretty much sums up the innings as the MCC piled up 581/6. Peter Parfitt made a subdued 47 and David Sheppard was dropped on 51, 77 and 83 before Mackay bowled him for 94. Ted Dexter powered his way to 80 in 85 minutes with a 6 and 13 fours, adding 110 with Sheppard.

Alan Smith came in at 512/6, but when he reached 22 he ducked into a Wes Hall bouncer that stayed low and became the second wicket-keeping casualty of the match.

Queensland only had to bat out the afternoon, but Mackay re-arranged the batting order and they promptly collapsed to Dexter's medium-paced swing (4/8) and the part-time leg-spin of Tom Graveney (2/2). Mackay came in for the penultimate ball with the score on at 94/7 and was missed in the slips.
