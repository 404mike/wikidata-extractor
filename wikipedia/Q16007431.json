While still a serving soldier, in 1923, he joined Kingstonian F.C. He signed amateur forms with Football League club Plymouth Argyle, but played only one competitive match for them before returning to Kingstonian, for whom he played until retiring from the game in 1936. During that time, he captained the club to victory in the 1933 Amateur Cup, was capped four times for the England amateur XI, and scored twice in each match as the Amateurs beat the Professionals 6\u20131 in the 1925 FA Charity Shield and 6\u20133 in the 1926 match.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Macey", "response": ["* Frank Macey (1894\u20131973), English amateur footballer"]}, {"page": "1925 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["The 1925 FA Charity Shield was the twelfth staging of the FA Charity Shield, an annual association football match arranged to raise funds for charitable causes supported by the Football Association (the FA), the governing body of football in England.

It was played on 5 October 1925 at White Hart Lane, London, and ended as a 6\u20131 win for the Amateurs. Claude Ashton scored four goals and Frank Macey two for the Amateurs; Charlie Hannaford scored the Professionals' goal.", "Centre-forward Ashton gave the Amateurs the lead after five minutes, with a hard shot into the corner off Walter Bellamy's cross. In the next quarter of an hour, the Professionals hit the frame of the goal three times. On the first occasion, Benjamin Howard Baker rushed out of goal but failed to collect Ernie Simms' shot; the ball struck the foot of the post, and Gates was able to clear before it spun back into the net. Then a shot from Jimmy Walsh and a volley by Jack Elkes each struck a post, rebounded into play, and were cleared by the defence. Soon afterwards, Simms suffered a leg strain. He played on, limping on the wing, until half-time, but took no part in the second half. After 35 minutes, Ashton scored his second goal, in similar fashion to the first; he trapped Bellamy's cross and shot hard into the corner. In what remained of the first half, Frank Macey had two close-range shots, \"but both were saved most brilliantly\" by Harry Hardy.", "|Forward|| Fsr Frank Macey||The Army||"]}, {"page": "1926 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["The 1926 FA Charity Shield was the thirteenth staging of the FA Charity Shield, an annual :association football match arranged to raise funds for charitable causes supported by the Football Association (the FA), the governing body of football in England.

The lead was doubled in similar fashion after 24 minutes. Rawlings had another two chances which he failed to take, and the Professionals seemed to be in control of the game. With half an hour gone, the Amateurs \"added dash and determination to their pattern-work passing\", and the tenor of the game changed dramatically. A neat pass from Frank Macey was touched over the line by Edgar Kail, and a couple of minutes later Wilfred Minter hooked home after some \"brilliant interpassing\" between Macey and his left-wing partner Walter Bellamy.
