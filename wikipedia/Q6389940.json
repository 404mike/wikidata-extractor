He worked at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR, Medical Research Council) in Hampstead and Mill Hill, where his work on steroids included contributions to the isolation and characterisation of vitamin D, and the synthesis of cortisone from naturally occurring steroids. After he retired from the NIMR in 1966 he worked on insect pheromones at Rothamsted Experimental Station (now Rothamsted Research) until 1971.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1901", "response": ["** Kenneth Callow, British biochemist (d. 1983)"]}, {"page": "Christ Church, Oxford", "response": ["In the sciences, polymath and natural philosopher Robert Hooke, developmental biologist John B.

This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical. In the UK in the early 1950s, John Cornforth and Kenneth Callow at the National Institute for Medical Research collaborated with Glaxo to produce cortisone from hecogenin from sisal plants."]}, {"page": "1901 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 15 February \u2013 Kenneth Callow, biochemist (died 1983)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Citizens", "response": ["*Kenneth Callow \u2013 Biochemist"]}, {"page": "Vitamin D", "response": ["In 1925, it was established that when 7-dehydrocholesterol is irradiated with light, a form of a fat-soluble vitamin is produced (now known as D3). Alfred Fabian Hess stated: \"Light equals vitamin D.\" Adolf Windaus, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928 for his work on the constitution of sterols and their connection with vitamins. In 1929, a group at NIMR in Hampstead, London, were working on the structure of vitamin D, which was still unknown, as well as the structure of steroids. A meeting took place with J.B.S. Haldane, J.D. Bernal, and Dorothy Crowfoot to discuss possible structures, which contributed to bringing a team together. X-ray crystallography demonstrated the sterol molecules were flat, not as proposed by the German team led by Windaus. In 1932, Otto Rosenheim and Harold King published a paper putting forward structures for sterols and bile acids which found immediate acceptance. The informal academic collaboration between the team members Robert Benedict Bourdillon, Otto Rosenheim, Harold King, and Kenneth Callow was very productive and led to the isolation and characterization of vitamin D. At this time, the policy of the Medical Research Council was not to patent discoveries, believing the results of medical research should be open to everybody. In the 1930s, Windaus clarified further the chemical structure of vitamin D."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Robert Kenneth Callow||20/03/1958||15 February 1901 \u2013 12 April 1983"]}, {"page": "Callow (surname)", "response": ["*Kenneth Callow (1901\u20131983), British biochemist"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Christ Church, Oxford", "response": ["Albert Einstein was elected to undertake a 5-year Research Studentship in 1931, philosopher and polymath Robert Hooke and developmental biologist Sir John B.
