Valuation theory, too, was an important technical extension, and was used by Helmut Hasse and Oscar Zariski.  Bourbaki used commutative algebra; sometimes local algebra is applied to the theory of local rings. Douglas Northcott's 1953 Cambridge Tract Ideal Theory (reissued 2004 under the same title) was one of the final appearances of the name."]}, {"page": "Height function", "response": ["Heights in Diophantine geometry were initially developed by Andr\u00e9 Weil and Douglas Northcott beginning in the 1920s. Innovations in 1960s were the N\u00e9ron\u2013Tate height and the realization that heights were linked to projective representations in much the same way that ample line bundles are in other parts of algebraic geometry. In the 1970s, Suren Arakelov developed Arakelov heights in Arakelov theory. In 1983, Faltings developed his theory of Faltings heights in his proof of Faltings's theorem."]}, {"page": "D. G.
