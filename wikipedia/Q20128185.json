However, Dawson lost his first choice goalkeeper role to Westwood and was placed on the substitute bench for a month, though he did appear once against Everton in the third round of the League Cup. It wasn't until on 18 October 2019 when he returned to the starting line\u2013up following the absent of Westwood, as Sheffield Wednesday drew 1\u20131 against Cardiff City. This was followed up by keeping a clean sheet, in a 1\u20130 win against Stoke City. Following this, Dawson returned to the substitute bench for the next four matches. It wasn't until on 27 November 2019 when he returned to the starting line\u2013up, in a 1\u20131 draw against Birmingham City. Dawson then kept two consecutive clean sheets between 14 December 2019 and 22 December 2019 against Nottingham Forest and Bristol City. He once again kept two consecutive clean sheets between 4 January 2020 and 11 January 2020 against Brighton & Hove Albion and Leeds United. It was announced on 27 January 2020 that he signed a new 4 1\u20442 year contract. Dawson continued as a first-team regular, and by the time the season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he had made twenty\u2013four league appearances.
