While Evangelicals emphasised the authority of the Bible and the traditions and historical documents of the kirk, the Moderates tended to stress intellectualism in theology, the established hierarchy of the kirk and attempted to raise the social status of the clergy.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 303\u20134. From the 1760s the Moderates gained an ascendancy in the General Assembly of the Church. They were led by the historian William Robertson (1721\u201393), who became principal of the University of Edinburgh and then by his successor George Hill (1750\u20131819), who was professor at the University of Aberdeen. Evangelical leaders included John Willison (1680\u20131750), John McLaurin (1693\u20131754) and Alexander Webster (1707\u201384). The most important figure was John Erskine (1721\u20131803), who was minister of Old Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh from 1768 and for 26 years a friend and colleague to Robertson. He was orthodox in doctrine, but sympathised with the Enlightenment and supported reforms in religious practice. A popular preacher, he corresponded with religious leaders in other countries, including New England theologian Johnathan Edwards (1703\u201358), whose ideas were a major influence on the movement in Scotland.D. W. Bebbington, \"Religious life: 6 Evangelism\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 515\u201316. Judged by the number of books printed in Scotland, Boston was the most popular theological writer in the movement.J. Yeager, Enlightened Evangelicalism: The Life and Thought of John Erskine (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 49\u201350."]}, {"page": "1750 in Scotland", "response": ["* 3 May \u2013 John Willison, evangelical Church of Scotland minister and religious writer (born 1680)"]}, {"page": "Willison, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Willison"]}, {"page": "1680 in Scotland", "response": ["* John Willison, evangelical Church of Scotland minister and religious writer (died 1750)"]}]}}
