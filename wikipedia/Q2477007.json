Freud, nephew of Anna  Freud and brother of Lucian Freud, he moved to the United Kingdom from Germany as a child and later worked as a prominent chef and food writer before becoming known to a wider audience as a television and radio personality. He was the longest serving panellist on the BBC Radio 4 panel show Just a Minute, appearing in each of the first 143 episodes, and making subsequent regular appearances up until his death in 2009. He was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament in 1973, retaining his seat until 1987, when he received a knighthood.\nIn 2016, seven years after his death, three women made public allegations of child sexual abuse and rape by Freud, which led to police investigations.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 15", "response": ["*2009 \u2013 Clement Freud, German-English journalist, academic, and politician (b. 1924)"]}, {"page": "April 24", "response": ["*1924 \u2013 Clement Freud, German-English radio host, academic, and politician (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "Liberal Party (UK)", "response": ["In local elections, Liverpool remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the elections to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973. On 26 July 1973, the party won two by-elections on the same day, in the Isle of Ely (with Clement Freud), and Ripon (with David Austick). In the February 1974 general election, the Conservative government of Edward Heath won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats. The Conservatives were unable to form a government due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland Sunningdale Agreement. The Liberals obtained 6.1 million votes, the most it would ever achieve, and now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the Home Office if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted it would only agree pending a clear government commitment to introducing proportional representation (PR) and a change of prime minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath's cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead, a minority Labour government was formed under Harold Wilson but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the October 1974 general election, the Liberals total vote slipped back slightly (and declined in each of the next three) and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority."]}, {"page": "Freud (disambiguation)", "response": ["** Clement Freud, Ernst's son, English politician, writer, chef and raconteur"]}, {"page": "Sigmund Freud", "response": ["Mark St. Germain's 2009 play Freud's Last Session imagines a meeting between C.

Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life by Armand Nicholi which also inspired a four-part non-fiction PBS series.
