He was educated at Rishworth School, West Yorkshire, and, after a time working as a railway booking clerk, he went to Leeds University where he was awarded 1st Class BA in English in 1924 and a PhD in 1926. His PhD thesis was on the place-names of the North Riding and the study of place-names remained of continuing interest to him, resulting in several publications. He was Vaughan Fellow at Leeds University from 1924 to 1926, and was then lecturer in English at Saltley College, Birmingham from 1926 to 1928. In 1928 he went to Sweden and was English lecturer at Uppsala University, returning to England in 1930 to University College London (UCL) as a lecturer and reader. In 1937 he was awarded a DLit degree at London University. During World War II, he enlisted in the RAF as an intelligence officer and in 1941 joined the Scientific Intelligence Unit of the Air Ministry under R V Jones, ending with the rank of Wing Commander. He was awarded the OBE for his war-time work in 1947. In 1949 he succeeded Raymond Wilson Chambers as Quain Professor of English at University College London. One of his  successors was his former student Randolph Quirk. He was director of Scandinavian studies at UCL from 1946 to 1963. In 1951 he took over the Survey of English Place\u2011Names, on which work had virtually ceased during the war.\nHe produced a large number of publications and was also joint editor of Methuen\u2019s series of Old English Library and of the Early English Texts Society's Facsimile of The Parker Chronicle and Laws 1941. His interests beyond literature included cricket, horology and mechanical engineering. He built a printing press to demonstrate bibliographical problems, but it was destroyed in the bombing of UCL during the war.\nHe was described in his obituary in the Times as \"a most lovable character who appeared to be of more than human stature. He could be maddening alike in matters of scholarship and in personal relations, though one's irritation never lasted long\". Randolph Quirk (as RQ) in a follow-up letter referred particularly to his \"hospitality and loyalty\".\nHe married in 1928 Helen Penelope Tomlinson the daughter of Charles Herbert Tomlinson, grocer of Solihull, and Lucy Florence Tomlinson (n\u00e9e Wilson). They had two children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Toponymy", "response": ["*Albert Hugh Smith (1903-1967), scholar of Old English and Scandinavian languages"]}, {"page": "Guisborough", "response": ["Assessing the origin of the name Guisborough, Albert Hugh Smith commented that it was a \"difficult\". From its first attestation in the Domesday Book into the 16th century, the second part sometimes derives from the originally Old English word burh ('town, fortification') and sometimes from the Old English word -burn ('stream'). It seems that the settlement was simply known by both names, the -burh/-borough forms predominate in the historical record and this survives today."]}, {"page": "Albert Smith", "response": ["* Albert Hugh Smith (1903\u20131967), English scholar of Old English and Scandinavian languages"]}, {"page": "E.
