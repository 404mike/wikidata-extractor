Retrieved 26 November 2008, from The Times Digital Archive. Gillman Barracks was chosen to be the military barracks of the British because of its prime location near the sea. Gillman Barracks housed the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment a line infantry regiment of the British Army, and the 2nd Battalion, Loyal Regiment of the British Army. The plan was to accommodate the expansion of the British infantry in Singapore. The camp included married quarters for officers, barracks buildings, sports facilities, messes, regimental institutes and even a swimming pool.", "Known as the primary colonial building, it once housed some of the British Army's most well-known warrant officers, such as General Sir Webb Gillman himself. This building served as the officers\u2019 married quarters, with recreational activities such as badminton carried out in the open spaces in front of the building. Today, the main colonial building has been named Block 9 in Gillman Barracks, the main and biggest block in the contemporary arts cluster. The similar colonial architecture has been preserved, and has survived various transformations in the Gillman area. Similar big windows, wide corridors and high arches are still present, allowing for good ventilation within the building.", "Block 9 was designed and built as a Warrant Officers and Sergeants Mess from the time it was constructed in 1935. It did not serve as officers quarters and most certainly did not accommodate General Webb Gillman - who died in office in 1933. Gillman only spent 3 months in Singapore during 1927. The building reverted to its original use after the Japanese surrender in 1945, it remained as a mess for the Royal Engineers until the British withdrawal in 1971"]}, {"page": "1919 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Maj.-Gen.
