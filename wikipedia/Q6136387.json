This, the first expedition up the western side of Lake Torrens, indicated a route northwards beyond the perceived barrier of the mysterious 'Horse-Shoe Lake' and gave an impetus for further explorations.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71686732 | The Country to the North-West, South Australian, 6 May 1851, p.2.

Additionally, they came under increased threat of attack on this frontier from local Aboriginals. When Oakden had broken up his station in March 1852, and was leaving the district, his party was sleeping under a bullock dray when they were disturbed by a number of Aboriginals approaching in the night. One of his party fired a shot amongst them, causing them to disperse, evidently without injury.South Australian Register, 26 June 1852, p.3, Protector of Aborigines' Report  Through association, Oakden Hills Station, 170 kilometres north of Port Augusta, between Lake Gairdner and Lake Torrens, today bears Oakden's name."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1802 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| James Hulkes"]}, {"page": "Hulkes, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Hulkes"]}]}}
