Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that \"[e]galitarianism implies rejecting speciesism, and in practice, it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals\" and that we should aid animals suffering in nature. Furthermore, Horta argues that \"because [nonhuman animals] are worse off in comparison to humans, egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests of nonhuman animals\"."]}, {"page": "Speciesism", "response": ["In Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes, published in 1824, the English writer and advocate for animal rights Lewis Gompertz, argued for egalitarianism and detailed how it could be applied to nonhuman animals. He asserted that the feelings and sensations experienced by humans and other animals are highly similar, stating: \"Things which affect us, generally seem to affect them in the same way; and at least the following sensations and passions are common to both, viz. hunger, desire, emulation, love of liberty, playfulness, fear, shame, anger, and many other affections\". He also argued that humans and other animals share many physiological characteristics and that this implied \"similitude of sensation\". Gompertz was critical of the human use of nonhuman animals, arguing that they are used \"without the slightest regard to their feelings, their wants, and their desires\"."]}, {"page": "List of inventors", "response": ["*Lewis Gompertz (\u20141861), UK \u2013 expanding chuck, improved velocipede"]}]}}
