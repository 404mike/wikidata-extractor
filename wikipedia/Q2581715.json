Shortly after the series finished, she appeared alongside Frankie Howerd in his sketch show, Howerd's Hour, on ITV. She continued her busy schedule with appearances in six films for 1969, including another with Sellers, The Magic Christian. Here she portrayed a character named Ginger, who was described as a \"grotesque figure\", with an \"insatiable lust for bestsellers on the atrocities of World War Two\". She also appeared on television alongside Harry Secombe and Roy Castle in Pickwick, which was based on the musical of the same name, and in Carry On Christmas, broadcast on Christmas Eve. Although 1969 had been busy, 1970 was relatively quiet in terms of her professional output: apart from an episode of Catweazle, she appeared alongside Willoughby Goddard in a six-episode series of Charley's Grants. She spent May and June filming Carry On Loving, in which she played Sophie Bliss, released in September that year. Another Carry On film followed in 1971, Carry On at Your Convenience, where she played Beattie Plummer, the housebound wife of Sid Plummer, played by Sid James. In the same year she completed another series with Sykes, Sykes and a Big, Big Show, a music and sketch programme which had six episodes, broadcast between February and April."]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| Young Sherlock Holmes || Paramount Pictures / Amblin Entertainment || Barry Levinson (director); Chris Columbus (screenplay); Nicholas Rowe, Alan Cox, Anthony Higgins, Sophie Ward, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Freddie Jones, Nigel Stock, Brian Oulton, Susan Fleetwood, Earl Rhodes, Patrick Newell, Donald Eccles, Walter Sparrow, Nadim Sawalha, Roger Brierley, Vivienne Chandler, Lockwood West, John Scott Martin, Willoughby Goddard, Ralph Tabakin, Nancy Nevinson, Michael Hordern || Mystery, Adventure || Live action"]}, {"page": "Not the Nine O'Clock News", "response": ["Aside from Atkinson, the original cast comprised Christopher Godwin, John Gorman, Chris Langham, Willoughby Goddard, and Jonathan Hyde, and the first episode of a planned series was scheduled for 2 April 1979; this also featured Chris Emmett (impersonating Denis Healey), Robert Llewelyn (impersonating Bob Hope) and Hertz Rental (narrating general elections in Greenland)."]}, {"page": "Ace of Wands (TV series)", "response": ["4 episodes.
