He made his League debut against West Bromwich Albion on 26 February 1983 and went on to make a further seven appearances that season. He played another seven league matches in 1983-84 but in the 1984 close season he was given a free transfer.\nHe moved to Wimbledon and spent three years there, including a brief loan period at Middlesbrough. In 1987, he joined Sunderland, and made over 200 appearances in eight years with the club (as well as a loan spell at Shrewsbury Town) before finishing his career with Preston North End and Scarborough. He helped Sunderland reach the 1992 FA Cup Final but missed the game through injury.Kay is fondly remembered by Sunderland fans for his hard tackling and determination. After one particularly tough challenge on Peter Haddock, a Leeds United player on 23 December 1990, the Leeds manager, Howard Wilkinson said that the player's leg \"looks like it's been run over by a tractor\". Kay earned the nickname \"The Tractor\" in reference to this comment. During his final game for Sunderland, against Birmingham City in 1993, Kay broke his leg and instead of writhing in pain, he sat up on the stretcher and pretended to row it off the pitch.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Kay", "response": ["John Kay may refer to:", "* John Kay (flying shuttle) (1704\u2013c. 1779), English inventor of the flying shuttle textile machinery", "* John Kay (spinning frame) (18th century), English developer of the spinning frame textile machinery", "* John Kay (caricaturist) (1742\u20131826), Scottish caricaturist", "* Sir John Kay (judge) (1943\u20132004), Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales", "* John Kay (musician) (born 1944), musician and lead singer of Canadian-American rock band Steppenwolf", "* John Kay (poet) (14th century), English Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom", "* John Kay (economist) (born 1948), Scottish economist, Financial Times columnist and author", "* John Kay (cricket journalist) (1910\u20131999), British cricket correspondent for The Argus", "* John Kay (journalist, born 1943) (1943\u20132021), British journalist convicted of the manslaughter of his wife, worked on Rupert Murdoch's The Sun", "* John Kay (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer of the 1870s and 1880s", "* John Caius the Elder (fl. 1480), or John Kay, poet", "* John Kay (poet born 1958), British poet and teacher", "* John Kay (English footballer) (born 1964), English former footballer", "* John Kaye (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["In May 1987, Smith was appointed manager at Sunderland, who had just been relegated into the Third Division for the first time in their history. York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than \u00a320,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay \u00a310,000. Smith agreed to a \u00a340,000-a-year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he would pay the extra \u00a310,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him: Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals (including 10 penalties) in his maiden season at Roker Park. He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for \u00a380,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987\u201388. A 7\u20130 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with 93 points."]}, {"page": "Michael Kay (footballer)", "response": ["Michael Joseph Kay (born 9 December 1989 in Consett, England) is an English former footballer.
