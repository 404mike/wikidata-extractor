Written by Tom Rob Smith and starring Jon Jon Briones and Darren Criss, in the roles of father and son, respectively, the episode that Bomer directs is titled \"Creator/Destroyer\". The episode was watched by more than 1 million people. Bomer had other opportunities to direct before but always wanted to wait for the optimum chance to immerse himself in a project. He read 3,000 pages of books on directing. He found a part in a 2018 revival of the Mart Crowley play The Boys in the Band, which was staged at Booth Theatre and marked his Broadway debut. Directed by Joe Mantello, it tells the story a group of gay men who gather for a birthday party in New York City. Theater critic Michael Sommers noted that \"Matt Bomer tends to fade in the glare of flashier personalities, but he lends the character a watchful quality as one of those deferential souls who is content to observe others.\" The play won a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play. Bomer's first film in 2018 was Bill Oliver's science fiction film Jonathan. His role was that of a detective who appears in only one scene of the film. Jonathan had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2018."]}, {"page": "Holodomor", "response": ["* Child 44 (2015), directed by Daniel Espinosa based on the book by Tom Rob Smith briefly describes the Holodomor"]}, {"page": "Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)", "response": ["*In Tom Rob Smith's novel Child 44, the first in the Leo Demidov trilogy, Demidov is an MGB agent"]}, {"page": "British Book Awards", "response": ["* 2009 \u2013 Child 44 by Tom Rob Smith"]}, {"page": "Helen McCrory", "response": ["In 2019, McCrory appeared as Kathryn Villiers in Tom Rob Smith\u2019s MotherFatherSon alongside Richard Gere and Billy Howle.
