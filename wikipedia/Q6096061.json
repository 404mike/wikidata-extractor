Essex has been classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963 and as a top-level Twenty20 team since the inauguration of the Twenty20 Cup in 2003.The details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as an Essex player and then his name is given as it would appear on modern match scorecards. Note that many players represented other first-class teams besides Essex and that some played for the club in minor cricket before 1894. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club. The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only.\n\nAs of 7 April 2021", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chapman (surname)", "response": ["*Ivan Chapman (1906\u20131976), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Weekend Magazine", "response": ["Weekend Magazine was a long-running television show, shown by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  Its original producer was Rex Clayton, with subsequent producers including Ivan Chapman. This short format show was typically filmed by the ABC's news correspondents in their spare time, the diversity of its subject matter reflecting the diversity of their interests.  During the 1970s, Weekend Magazine was run after the Sunday evening news.  \"Sunspot\", the distinctive theme music accompanying its credits, was written by Tony Osborne.  The program was terminated by ABC management during the 1980s, in the face of outcry from audience and journalists alike."]}]}}
