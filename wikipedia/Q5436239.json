Somerset scored 117 runs in their first innings, of which Sainsbury contributed nine. The bowling of Bastard, who took eight for 59, helped to restrict Hampshire to 162. Despite their low numbers, Somerset reached 166 in their second innings, Sainsbury scoring ten from number five in the batting order. With Bastard unable to replicate his first innings performance, Hampshire reached the winning total of 123 from 60.3 overs. Somerset played Surrey and Gloucestershire in their final two matches of the season and lost both heavily, although they did succeed in avoiding any further record defeats; Surrey won by an innings and five runs, and Gloucestershire by nine wickets. Sainsbury's highest score in his four innings was 14. In the six matches that he played that season, all for Somerset, Sainsbury scored 119\u00a0runs at an average of 9.91, a marginal improvement on his previous season."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Farrant Reed ", "Somerset's first match of 1885 commenced on 16 July 1885, over two months after Nottinghamshire faced Sussex and Surrey travelled to Hampshire to open the first-class county cricket season in England. Somerset began their season at home against Hampshire, and after losing the toss were asked to field. Somerset's bowlers restricted the visitors to 175\u00a0runs in the first innings, during which Bastard took a career-best eight wickets in the innings, conceding 54 runs (eight for 54) off his 38\u00a0four-ball overs. In reply, Somerset fell short of equalling their opponents and were bowled out for 153, Radcliffe top-scoring with 51\u00a0runs. Bastard collected another three wickets in the second innings, granting him one of two career ten-wicket hauls, and Winter took four as Somerset bowled Hampshire out for 111, leaving themselves needing 134 to win. None of Somerset's top four batsmen reached 20 runs, but an unbeaten 50 from Hewett, accompanied by 32 from the number seven, Farrant Reed, helped Somerset achieve a five-wicket victory."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1884", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Farrant Reed "]}, {"page": "Herbert Reed", "response": ["* Herbert Farrant Reed (1865\u20131911), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1883", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Farrant Reed "]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Farrant Reed (1882) : H.
