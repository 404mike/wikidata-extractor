Crewe won just one of their first 15 league games and were bottom of the table on 2 November, six points from safety after a draw against fellow strugglers Doncaster Rovers. After Crewe were knocked out of the FA Cup in the first round by Swindon Town, Artell brought in former team-mate Alex Neil as a \"fresh pair of eyes\" to review Crewe's first team."]}, {"page": "Wintle", "response": ["* Ryan Wintle (born 1997), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Crewe Alexandra F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Ryan Wintle"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale took the short trip to Crewe on 2 April and started poorly after an error from Boot gifted Ryan Wintle the opening goal on seven minutes, but they equalised before half-time with a penalty against the run of play; Kay seemed to have scored the winning goal from long-range on 71 minutes, but a stoppage-time equaliser from Charlie Kirk denied Vale the three points. Five days later Vale lost 2\u20131 at home to Crawley after Smith gave away a penalty and scored an own goal, though the penalty decision of referee Mike Jones was highly contentious; Aspin called the referee's performance 'diabolical'. Newly crowned EFL Trophy champions Lincoln visited Vale Park on 14 April, and Vale all but secured their safety on that day after Kay scored the winner on 63 minutes. Vale set up defensively at Mansfield and managed to rescue a point after a late equalising goal from Pope cancelled out a clumsy own goal; after match Aspin summarised the season by saying that \"I think they have done well, from the position they were in, to getting to safety.\" Angus scored on his home debut on 28 April, but this was not enough to prevent the final match of the season at Vale Park being a 2\u20131 defeat to Carlisle United, much to Aspin's disappointment."]}]}}
