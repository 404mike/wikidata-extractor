Grand Admiral Erich Raeder had advised Hitler in June that air superiority was a pre-condition for a successful invasion of Britain, so Hitler ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force (RAF) airbases and radar stations, as well as nightly air raids on British cities, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the RAF in what became known as the Battle of Britain, and by the end of October, Hitler realised that air superiority would not be achieved. He permanently postponed the invasion, a plan which the commanders of the German army had never taken entirely seriously. Several historians, including Andrew Gordon, believe the primary reason for the failure of the invasion plan was the superiority of the Royal Navy, not the actions of the RAF."]}, {"page": "Operation Sea Lion", "response": ["Although Operation Sea Lion was never attempted, there has been much speculation about its hypothetical outcome. The great majority of military historians, including Peter Fleming, Derek Robinson and Stephen Bungay, have expressed the opinion that it had little chance of success and would have most likely resulted in a disaster for the Germans. Fleming states it is doubtful whether history offers any better example of a victor so nearly offering his vanquished foe an opportunity of inflicting on him a resounding defeat. Len Deighton and some other writers have called the German amphibious plans a \"Dunkirk in reverse\".Deighton, Len (1980) Battle of Britain London: Jonathan Cape,  Robinson argues the massive superiority of the Royal Navy over the Kriegsmarine would have made Sea Lion a disaster. Dr Andrew Gordon, in an article for the Royal United Services Institute JournalRUSI Journal,  (retrieved 27 December 2017) agrees with this and is clear in his conclusion the German Navy was never in a position to mount Sealion, regardless of any realistic outcome of the Battle of Britain. In his fictional alternate history Invasion: the German invasion of England, July 1940, Kenneth Macksey proposes that the Germans might have succeeded if they had swiftly and decisively begun preparations even before the Dunkirk evacuations, and the Royal Navy for some reason had held back from large-scale intervention,Macksey 1990, pp. 144\u201346. though in practice the Germans were unprepared for such a speedy commencement of their assault.Macksey 1990, pp. 209\u201310 The German official naval war historian, Vice Admiral Kurt Assmann, wrote in 1958: \"Had the German Air Force defeated the Royal Air Force as decisively as it had defeated the French Air Force a few months earlier, I am sure Hitler would have given the order for the invasion to be launched \u2013 and the invasion would in all probability been smashed\"."]}, {"page": "United States Naval Academy", "response": ["* Andrew Gordon, August 2007 \u2013 June 2009"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Andrew Gordon (born 1951), British naval history"]}, {"page": "Aberystwyth University", "response": ["*Andrew Gordon naval historian"]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Andrew Gordon (born 1951) \u2013 naval", "* Andrew Gordon (born 1952)", "* Andrew Gordon (born 1951) \u2013 Battle of Jutland"]}, {"page": "HMS Victoria (1887)", "response": ["*Andrew Gordon, The Rules of the Game: Jutland and British Naval Command, John Murray."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Military writers", "response": ["List of all pages in category Military writers retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.

Jutland 1916, 199. Even by the strict disciplinary standards of the Royal Navy, Arbuthnot's zeal was unusual; in 1900 as executive officer of Royal Sovereign, Arbuthnot wrote and published A Battleship Commander's Order Book, containing some 300 pages of detailed standing orders for his crew, when a ship's Commander at this time would typically produce just a few pages of special instructions to act as an addendum to the standardized King's Regulations procedural manual. While the book remains a valuable source of historical information on details of life aboard a battleship at this time, it made Arbuthnot the butt of so many jokes from his contemporaries that he later allegedly requested it not be mentioned in his biographical entry in Who's Who in the Navy.Gordon p. 392, p. 669 citing Bonnett, Price of Admiralty p.143 Aside from his love of discipline, he also continued his obsession with physical and spiritual fitness, spending several hours each day performing strenuous exercises on deck, rain or shine, attending daily church services and lecturing his crew on Christian virtue. Although largely regarded with bemused admiration by his superiors and respectful fear by his subordinates, his extreme nature caused some to consider him a fanatic; Andrew Gordon describes him as \"in a colloquial if not a clinical sense, insane.\""]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the University of London", "response": ["* Andrew Gordon (KCL)"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Military historians", "response": ["Andrew Gordon (naval historian)not yet classified"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Naval historians", "response": ["Andrew Gordon (naval historian)Stub"]}]}}
