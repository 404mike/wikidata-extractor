The first week of the January transfer window saw a high turnover of players with the loans of Sid Nelson, Olufela Olomola and Matt Worthington expiring while the loan of Keston Davies was terminated after he had failed to break into the Yeovil side. The four loans were replaced with Liverpool defender Corey Whelan, Barnsley midfielder Jared Bird, Middlesbrough attacking midfielder Lewis Wing and Southampton striker Marcus Barnes all joining the club on loan until the end of the season from their respective clubs. On 6 January, Yeovil faced League One side Bradford City in the third round of the FA Cup. Despite being the lowest ranked team left in the competition, Yeovil won the match 2\u20130 with a goal from Marcus Barnes on his debut and a third of the season from Jordan Green enough to see Yeovil through to the fourth round for only the fourth time in their history. Yeovil then faced Forest Green Rovers in the third round of the EFL Trophy, and secured back-to-back 2\u20130 wins with goals from Nathan and Connor Smith enough to secure qualification to the quarter-finals of the competition. Having established himself in the Yeovil team, attacker Jordan Green was rewarded with a new contract until the summer of 2019, while defender Tom James also signed an improved contract. On 13 January, Yeovil drew 1\u20131 away at relegation rivals Port Vale, with Fran\u00e7ois Zoko scoring his tenth goal of the season to give the Glovers the lead but they conceded in the final five minutes to drop two points. The following week saw the club confirm that they had received a \"substantial bid\" for winger Otis Khan which had met a release clause in his contract, and that there had also been interest in defender Omar Sowunmi. On 20 January, Yeovil faced Chesterfield in a relegation six-pointer, after falling behind against the run of play Lewis Wing equalised with a 25-yard looping shot, his first goal for the club. In the final minute of injury time after Otis Khan appeared to have his shirt pulled he stopped playing allowing Chestefield to go up the other end to score a late winner with Khan then being sent off for shoving referee Kevin Johnson. Yeovil appealed the decision to send the midfielder off, but the appeal was deemed frivolous and Khan's ban was subsequently extended to five matches.", "Following the postponement of their match against Swindon, Yeovil began March with their rearranged EFL Trophy semi-final tie against League One leaders Shrewsbury Town. The Glovers held their own but rarely threatened, and were knocked out courtesy of a Carlton Morris goal. On 7 March, defender Bevis Mugabi received a second call-up to the Uganda national football team for their March friendly matches. On 10 March, Yeovil suffered a 2\u20130 home defeat against Newport County. Due to international call-ups for Bevis Mugabi, Rhys Browne, Shaun Donnellan and Corey Whelan, Yeovil's trip to Accrington Stanley was postponed until the 17 April. Debuts for Stuart Nelson and Shaun Donnellan saw Yeovil end their three match losing run with a 0\u20130 draw away at promotion chasing Exeter City, this was then followed by a 1\u20130 away win at Colchester United with Nelson saving an early penalty before Alex Fisher scored the winning goal. The international break saw Bevis Mugabi make his full international debut for Uganda in friendlies against S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and Malawi, while Rhys Browne scored his first international goal for Antigua and Barbuda in a 3\u20132 win against Bermuda. Donnellan and Whelan both featured for the Republic of Ireland U21s, with Donnellan scoring a crucial winning goal against Azerbaijan. The end of March also saw fans select the club's new shirt for the 2018\u201319 season made by TAG Sportswear, while the home match against Forest Green Rovers on Good Friday was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Dunne (footballer, born 1997)", "response": ["In March 2018, Dunne received a call-up to the Republic of Ireland under-21 side for the first time, making his debut on 22 March 2018 in a 3\u20131 friendly win over Iceland, replacing Corey Whelan as a substitute late in the game."]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Crewe Alexandra F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2018 || CB ||  || Corey Whelan || Liverpool || 7 January 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2019 Phoenix Rising FC season", "response": ["|align=left| Corey Whelan"]}, {"page": "2019 FC Tucson season", "response": ["|align=left| Corey Whelan"]}, {"page": "2020 Phoenix Rising FC season", "response": ["| 4 || Corey Whelan ||  || DF ||  || 2020 ||  Crewe Alexandra", "|align=left| Corey Whelan"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Wigan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["|Corey Whelan", "| 22 January 2021 || RB ||  || Corey Whelan ||  Phoenix Rising || Free transfer ||"]}]}}
