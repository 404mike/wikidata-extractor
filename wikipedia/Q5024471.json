He impressed for Stoke due to his high energy levels and was on the verge of gaining an international call up but he gained a reputation for off the field confrontations after a training ground 'bust up' with Maurice Setters. He was sold to Sunderland in February 1968 but did not get along with manager Alan Brown and left for South African football with Cape Town City, Hellenic, Durban United and Berea Park. In between his time in South Africa he turned out for Crewe Alexandra and Hereford United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maurice Setters", "response": ["He played 19 times for Stoke in 1964\u201365 as Stoke claimed a mid-table finish of 11th position. At the end of the campaign, with the squad training for their pre-season in the United States, Setters was involved in a 'bust-up' with teammate Calvin Palmer. Setters apologised to manager Tony Waddington and was allowed to travel to the United States but Palmer did not apologise and was forced to stay in England. Out in America, Setters played nine times for the Cleveland Stokers scoring three goals. He missed just three matches in 1965\u201366 playing in 45 fixtures. His run in the first team continued in 1966\u201367 until he sustained injury against Liverpool on 4 March 1967 which allowed Alan Bloor to take his place. After failing to dislodge Bloor, Setters joined Coventry City in November 1967 for a \u00a325,000 fee. During this time he played nine games as a guest player with the Cleveland Stokers in the North American United Soccer Association.  Setters made 59 appearances for Coventry in just under three years at Highfield Road and ended his career with a four-month spell with Second Division Charlton Athletic from January 1970, playing in eight games."]}, {"page": "Willie Stevenson", "response": ["Stoke manager Tony Waddington paid \u00a330,000 for Stevenson as a replacement for the departed Calvin Palmer. He played 20 games in 1967\u201368 and 34 times in 1968\u201369 as Stoke had two poor seasons, narrowly avoiding relegation. A much improved 1969\u201370 campaign saw Stevenson play 23 games as Stoke finished in 9th. He played six matches at the start of 1970\u201371 before injury ruled him out for the remainder of the season. He played 25 games in 1971\u201372 and just three in 1972\u201373.

He was unable to prevent Mike Stringfellow from scoring after six minutes following a defensive error. Stoke hit back and a perfect pass from Jimmy McIlroy cut through the Foxes\u2019 defence and Dennis Viollet levelled the scores. This put Stoke into the ascendency but then a nasty leg injury to Calvin Palmer saw him stretchered off and thus put Stoke down to 10 men. Leicester capitalised on the situation and before Palmer was able to get back on the pitch Gibson headed in a Howard Riley corner. With not long left Stoke pushed forward and left a too big a gap in defence and Dave Gibson made it 3\u20131. Stoke to their credit fought on and pulled one back through George Kinnell but it was too late as Leicester won the tie 3\u20132 giving them a 4\u20133 aggregate win and with it the League Cup.", "|||4|| Calvin Palmer", "|||4|| Calvin Palmer"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["Stoke made a dream start to the 1963\u201364 season beating Tottenham Hotspur 2\u20131 at home on the opening match of the season, Jimmy McIlroy scoring both goals, and then accounting for Aston Villa 3\u20131 two days later. There followed though, a run of 10 matches without a win and Stoke found themselves at the wrong end of the table. Waddington was not happy with his defence and went out and bought Calvin Palmer from Nottingham Forest for \u00a330,000 and George Kinnell from Aberdeen for \u00a327,000 and another 'keeper Lawrie Leslie from West Ham United. On the other hand, he released Don Ratcliffe, and Ron Wilson. John Ritchie was introduced into the first team by October and he made an instant impression as he started scoring the first few of his 171 for the club. With Ritchie in full flow, things improved and in nine matches from early October to mid November, Stoke remained unbeaten.
