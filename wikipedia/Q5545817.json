Walker is a left-handed batsman who bowls slow left-arm orthodox. He was born at Norwich, Norfolk.\nWalker made his debut in county cricket for Norfolk against Suffolk in the 2000 Minor Counties Championship. He later joined Leicestershire, making his first-class debut for the county against Kent in the 2002 County Championship. That was his only first-class appearance in that season, and in the following season he made two further first-class appearances against Nottinghamshire and Sussex. He struggled in his three first-class appearances up to then for the county, taking just a single wicket. He was released by Leicestershire at the end of the 2004 season, along with Damian Brandy and Darren Stevens. While studying at Loughborough University, Walker made a single first-class appearance in 2004 for Loughborough UCCE against Sussex at the County Ground, Hove.Having not secured any first-class contracts with other county sides, Walker returned to Minor counties cricket with Norfolk in 2005. His MCCA Knockout Trophy debut came four seasons later in 2008, against Hertfordshire. Following an injury to off-spinner Jigar Naik during the 2009 season, Walker was invited back to Leicestershire as cover for Naik, and after taking five wickets for the Leicestershire Seconds, he was selected to play for the team in their County Championship match against Derbyshire. He made two further first-class appearances in that season, against Middlesex and Essex, though again he had little success, scoring 21 runs at an average of 5.25, while taking two wickets at an expensive bowling average of 79.50. Walker wasn't offered any long-term deal by Leicestershire and once again returned to Minor counties cricket with Norfolk, who he has appeared for to date in 28 Minor Counties Championship and 19 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Walker", "response": ["George Walker may refer to:", "*George Walker (chess player) (1803\u20131879), English chess player and writer", "*George Walker (composer) (1922\u20132018), American composer", "*George Walker (illustrator) (1781\u20131856), author of The Costume of Yorkshire", "*George Walker (novelist) (1772\u20131847), English gothic novelist", "*George Walker (printmaker) (born 1960), Canadian writer, artist and printmaker", "*George Walker (privateer) (died 1777), British privateer", "*George Walker (professor) (born 1942), author on physical chemistry and international education, former director general of the IBO", "*George Walker (Puritan) (1581\u20131651), English clergyman", "*George Walker (vaudeville) (1873\u20131911), American vaudeville singer, partner of Bert Williams", "*George Walker (CPR president), president of the Canadian Pacific Railway", "*Sir George Walker, 1st Baronet (1764\u20131842), British General, of the Forestier-Walker baronets", "*George Walker (attorney) (1824\u20131888), Massachusetts state congressman, banker, corporate executive, political adviser, advocate for bimetallism and U.S. Consul-General in Paris", "*George Walker (Kentucky politician) (1763\u20131819), U.S. Senator from Kentucky", "*George Walker (soldier) (c. 1645\u20131690), clergyman and English colonel in Ireland", "*George Walker (Australian footballer) (1894\u20131973), Australian rules footballer", "*George Walker (1880s pitcher) (1863\u2013?), former Major League Baseball player from Canada", "*George Walker (cricketer, born 1919) (1919\u20131995), English cricketer", "*George Walker (cricketer, born 1984), English cricketer", "*George Walker (footballer, born 1877) (1877\u20131930), English football full-back with Crystal Palace", "*George Walker (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u2013?), Scottish international footballer", "*George Walker (footballer, born 1934) (1934\u20132012), English football inside forward with Bristol City and Carlisle United", "*George Walker (1930s pitcher) (1915\u20131967), American Negro leagues baseball player", "*George Walker (wrestler), Canadian wrestler", "*George Walker (mathematician) (c. 1730\u20131807), English Dissenter and mathematician", "*George Walker, member of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters and first husband of Carolyn Garcia"]}, {"page": "Darren Stevens", "response": ["After two average seasons for Leicestershire, Stevens was released by his home county at the end of the 2004 season, along with Damian Brandy and George Walker. He then joined Kent for the 2005 season. He made a very good start to his Kent career, scoring over 1,000 runs in a season for the first time in his career. 2006 proved to be disappointing by comparison, yet he still averaged 39. His performances in the Pro40 League, however, brought Kent to the verge of promotion."]}, {"page": "Damian Brandy", "response": ["In that same season, Brandy made his debut for Leicestershire in a List A match against Somerset in the 2002 Norwich Union League. He also made his first-class debut in that season against the same opponents in the County Championship. He made one further List A and first-class match for the county in that season. In 2003, Brandy made just a single List A appearance against Surrey in the 2003 National League, though he appeared more regularly in first-class cricket, making six appearances. It was in this season that he made his Twenty20 debut in the Twenty20 Cup against Lancashire, with Brandy playing two further matches in that season's competition against Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Brandy found himself further on the fringes of the Leicestershire team in 2004, making just a single first-class appearance against Hampshire in the County Championship, as well as a single Twenty20 appearance against Surrey. He also featured in three List A matches in the totesport League, with his final appearance in that format coming against Worcestershire. Brandy was released by Leicestershire at the end of the 2004 season, along with George Walker and Darren Stevens. During his spell at Leicestershire, Brandy made nine first-class appearances, scoring 187 runs at an average of 15.58, with a high score of 52.
