As a consequence of their resolution, it was determined that at the death of the Duke of Wharton, the Barony had fallen into abeyance between the Duke's sisters, Lady Jane Holt and Lady Lucy Morice. It was further determined that, at Lady Lucy's death in 1739, Lady Jane (by now Lady Jane Coke) remained the sole heir, and had been therefore entitled to the Barony. Finally, it was determined that at her death the Barony again fell into abeyance, where it remained in the nineteenth century.  The Committee for Privileges, however, also ruled that it did not have the authority to terminate the abeyance because of the existence of a judgement of outlawry against the Duke of Wharton.  Thus the matter remained unresolved for 72 years."]}, {"page": "Bridgwater (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"| Charles Kemeys-Tynte (1)", "|rowspan=\"4\"| Charles Kemeys-Tynte (2) ||rowspan=\"3\"| Whig"]}, {"page": "Jane Wharton, 7th Baroness Wharton", "response": ["In 1844, the extinct title Baron Wharton was claimed by Colonel Charles Kemeys-Tynte, formerly a Member of Parliament from 1820 to 1837. The documents that had created that peerage in 1544 had been lost, so the House of Lords's Committee for Privileges ruled (erroneously) that the barony had been created by writ, meaning that it would descend to heirs general. By this application of the succession, it was ruled that Lady Jane Coke had been Baroness Wharton in her own right, from her sister's death in 1739 to her own death. Colonel Kemeys-Tynte's claim came from his descent from Lady Jane's grandfather the 4th Baron, as after Jane's death the succession would be divided among his daughters' descendants, including Kemeys-Tynte.", "The House of Lords did not act upon the barony (which it now considered to be in abeyance) due to the Duke of Wharton's status as an outlaw, but in 1916 Colonel Kemeys-Tynte's great-great-grandson, also named Charles Kemeys-Tynte, succeeded in having the title called out of abeyance in his favour. Because the Duke of Wharton was the 6th Baron Wharton and Lady Jane Coke was considered to have held the barony after him, the new Lord Wharton was counted as the 8th Baron. As the succession of the title between 1731 and 1916 is based on different rules than the (lost) ones actually implemented in 1544, he may more properly considered the 1st Baron of a new creation given the precedence of 1544, but the so-called 7th Baroness is the only intervening person considered to have held the title at all."]}, {"page": "Charles Kemeys Kemeys-Tynte", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Kemeys-Tynte (1778\u20131860)"]}, {"page": "Charles Tynte", "response": ["*Charles Kemeys-Tynte (1800\u20131882), English Liberal politician", "*Charles Kemeys-Tynte (1778\u20131860), English Whig and Liberal politician", "*Charles Kemeys-Tynte, 8th Baron Wharton (1876\u20131934)"]}, {"page": "Charles Kemeys Kemeys Tynte", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Kemeys-Tynte (1778\u20131860)"]}, {"page": "Charles Kemeys-Tynte (1778-1860)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Kemeys-Tynte (1778\u20131860)"]}]}}
