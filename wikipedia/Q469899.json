Their location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925. Over the next five years, Chapman built a new Arsenal. He appointed an enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker, implemented Charlie Buchan's new twist on the nascent WM formation, captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, and lavished Highbury's income on stars like David Jack and Alex James. With record-breaking spending and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club."]}, {"page": "Plumstead", "response": ["*Charlie Buchan, footballer and writer"]}, {"page": "Sunderland A.F.C.", "response": ["The holder of the record for the most league appearances is Jimmy Montgomery, having made 527\u00a0first team appearances between 1961 and 1976.Dykes, pp. 280\u2013282.

In 1927, the Daily Mail  reported that Norris had made under-the-counter payments to Sunderland's Charlie Buchan as an incentive for him to join Arsenal in 1925; this was in an era of the League's maximum wage, and any additional financial incentives to players were strictly outlawed, although many clubs at the time broke the rules. A subsequent investigation by the Football Association found that Norris had also used Arsenal's expense accounts for personal use to pay for his chauffeur, and had pocketed the proceeds of \u00a3125 from the sale of the team bus. Norris sued the Daily Mail and the FA for libel, but in February 1929, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Hewart, found in favour of the FA, and they subsequently banned Norris for life from football."]}]}}
