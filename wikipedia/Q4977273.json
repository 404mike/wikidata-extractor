Nevertheless, the deportations brought significant challenges: social, such as forcibly being removed from one's place of living, and more practical such as abandoning a well-developed family business. Countries also face other practical challenges: for example, even decades after, one could notice certain hastily developed parts of Athens, residential areas that had been quickly erected on a budget while receiving the fleeing Asia Minor population. To this day, Greece and Turkey still have properties, and even villages such as Kayak\u00f6y, that have been left abandoned since the exchange."]}, {"page": "Twice A Stranger: How Mass Expulsion Forged Modern Greece and Turkey", "response": ["Twice A Stranger: How Mass Expulsion Forged Modern Greece and Turkey (also published as Twice A Stranger: The Mass Expulsions that Forged Modern Greece and Turkey) is a book by Bruce Clark published in 2006 concerning the population exchange between Greece and Turkey which took place in the early 1920s, following the Treaty of Lausanne.

However, he praises the book for \"offer[ing] a subtle diagnosis of why, at particular moments over a span of three decades, Ottoman rulers and their successors unleashed torrents of suffering\". In Agos, Vicken Cheterian criticizes the book, saying that it offers few new insights. \"The two authors, by posing this question as the start of their investigation, give the impression as if no historian had noticed before them about the exterminations of Ottoman Christians, as if no one had written this history before them.\" Alex J. Bellamy opined that the \"important, beautifully crafted book\" \"contributes significantly to our understanding of what happened during these 30 years of violence, as well as to our understanding of genocide more broadly\"."]}]}}
