Because she persisted in working as a cook, by which she exposed others to the disease, she was twice forcibly quarantined by authorities, eventually for the final two decades of her life.

Although other cases of human-to-human spread of typhoid were known at the time, the concept of an asymptomatic carrier, who was able to transmit disease, had only been hypothesized and not yet identified or proven. Mary Mallon became the first known example of an asymptomatic carrier of an infectious disease, making typhoid fever the first known disease being transmissible through asymptomatic hosts. The cases and deaths caused by Mary Mallon were mainly upper-class families in New York City. At the time of Mary's tenure as a personal cook for upper-class families, New York City reported 3,000 to 4,500 cases of typhoid fever annually. In the summer of 1906 two daughters of a wealthy family and maids working in their home became ill with typhoid fever. After investigating their home water sources and ruling out water contamination, the family hired civil engineer George Soper to conduct an investigation of the possible source of typhoid fever in the home. Soper described himself as an \"epidemic fighter\". His investigation ruled out many sources of food, and lead him to question if the cook the family hired just prior to their household outbreak, Mallon, was the source. Since she had already left and begun employment elsewhere, he proceeded to track her down in order to obtain a stool sample.  When he was able to finally meet Ms. Mallon in person he described her by saying \"Mary had a good figure and might have been called athletic had she not been a little too heavy.\" In recounts of Soper's pursuit of Mallon, his only remorse appears to be that he was not given enough credit for his relentless pursuit and publication of her personal identifying information, stating that the media \"rob[s] me of whatever credit belongs to the discovery of the first typhoid fever carrier to be found in America.\" Ultimately, 51 cases were suspected to be caused by Ms. Mallon and 3 deaths.", "*Mary Mallon, \"Typhoid Mary\" - see history section, \"carriers\" for further details"]}, {"page": "1869", "response": ["* September 23 \u2013 Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary), first known (in the United States) asymptomatic carrier of the pathogen associated with typhoid fever (d. 1938)"]}, {"page": "County Tyrone", "response": ["* Mary Mallon (1869\u20131938), more commonly known as Typhoid Mary"]}, {"page": "Cookstown", "response": ["* Mary Mallon, aka Typhoid Mary."]}]}}
