Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words.  Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band.  For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something \"smarter, neater more classy\".

He was overruled by the band, who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have \"an ear underwater\". The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling.  The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water). Thorgerson later expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: \"I think Meddle is a much better album than its cover\". Thorgerson's colleague Aubrey Powell shared his sentiments, saying: \"Meddle was a mess.  I hated that cover.

Presented as a triple gatefold sleeve, the front cover depicts the back of a standing nude male looking at the Century Plaza Towers in Century City, California against a blue sky.

Inside features a photograph of each band member by Lake Geneva and \u00cele de Peilz, an island on the lake that consists of a single tree. Richard Manning, a freelance artist who worked for Hipgnosis at the time, used double weighted photo paper to accommodate the triple gatefold. He applied various techniques onto the design including a light blue dye wash, clouds added with an airbrush, and photomontage. The coloured lines running through the cover were added at the printing stage. Anderson said the lines intersecting through the male define \"points of the anatomy relative to our development.\""]}]}}
