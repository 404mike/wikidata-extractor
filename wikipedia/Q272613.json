It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually, five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled Confidential Report. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements."]}, {"page": "Samuel Beckett", "response": ["===Billie Whitelaw===", "Billie Whitelaw worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography Billie Whitelaw... Who He?, she describes their first meeting in 1963 as \"trust at first sight\". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse, the \"supreme interpreter of his work\", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: \"I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section.

She then went on to study at Cone-Ripman School, Tring, Hertfordshire (now Tring Park School for the Performing Arts), where she found she was good at history, English and art.

The style is reminiscent of Mouth's logorrhoea in Not I, the obvious difference being that these characters constantly use first person pronouns. Clich\u00e9s and puns abound. While one is talking the other two are silent and in darkness. They neither acknowledge the existence of the others around them (M: \"To think we were never together\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p. 156) nor appear aware of anything outside their own being and past (W2: \"At the same time I prefer this to . . . the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p. 152).
