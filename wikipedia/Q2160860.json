A further move to Bromsgrove in 1960 meant that he played more in the Midlands. In the 1960s he was part of Ken Ingram's Band and Eddie Matthews' Jump Band. In the following decade he freelanced, led his own quintet, and played in Europe with Rod Mason. Foxley returned to Colyer in 1986, and stayed with the Ken Colyer Trust Band until 1994, following the leader's death. In the same decade, he also freelanced and led his own band.
