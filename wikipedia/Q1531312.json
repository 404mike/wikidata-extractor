Klaus Roth and Bob Vaughan proved that uncovered area at least proportional to the square root of the side length may sometimes be needed; proving a tight bound on the uncovered area remains an open problem."]}, {"page": "Vaughan (surname)", "response": ["*Bob Vaughan (born 1945), British mathematician"]}, {"page": "Klaus Roth", "response": ["Although Roth's work on Diophantine approximation led to the highest recognition for him, it is his research on irregularities of distribution that (according to an obituary by William Chen and Bob Vaughan) he was most proud of. His 1954 paper on this topic laid the foundations for modern discrepancy theory. It concerns the placement of n points in a unit square so that, for every rectangle bounded between the origin and a point of the square, the area of the rectangle is well-approximated by the number of points in it.", "Roth also made significant progress on square packing in a square. If unit squares are packed into an s\\times s square in the obvious, axis-parallel way, then for values of s that are just below an integer, nearly 2s area can be left uncovered. After Paul Erd\u0151s and Ronald Graham proved that a more clever tilted packing could leave a significantly smaller area, only O(s^{7/11}), Roth and Bob Vaughan responded with a 1978 paper proving the first nontrivial lower bound on the problem. As they showed, for some values of s, the uncovered area must be at least proportional to \\sqrt{s}."]}, {"page": "R. C.
