Though George R. Stewart used foot terminology to describe verse, his scansion ignored feet, concentrating instead on syntactic groupings. Most modern dissent, however, can be seen in terms of Otto Jespersen's resolute denial of the \"fallacy of the foot\" (1979, p 109); he described verse lines instead as a series of \"weak\" and \"strong\" positions, and both generative metrists and \"rhythmi-metrical\" scanners have generally followed in his anti-footsteps. Halle & Keyser (1972, p 222) dismiss the foot, their signal concept the \"Stress Maximum\" explicitly transcending (or transgressing) its boundaries. Paul Kiparsky however (a later generativist) reinstates the concept of the foot (\"Generative Metrics\" in Preminger & Brogan 1993, pp 452\u201353). Derek Attridge (1982, p 17) says, \"[a]t best, then, the division of lines into feet adds nothing, at worst it hinders accurate analysis of the metrical variations which all readers perceive.\" Alone among the \"rhythmi-metrical\" scanners Peter L. Groves reintroduces \"notional\" feet at a very general level (they figure in his verse theory but not in his actual scansions), but he distances his notion from that of traditional metrics (1998, p 107). T.V.F. Brogan (\"Foot\" in Preminger & Brogan 1993, p 419) threads the needle, saying that the foot is \"more than a mere analytic tool, a device of scansion: it is a principle of structure\" yet that it is \"not necessarily an element in poetic composition ... and it is almost certainly not an element of performance\"; and finally that \"[i]n scansion, it can be used to describe and analyze verse whose regularities support it, and not verse which does not.\""]}, {"page": "Restoration literature", "response": ["thumb|left|upright|Aphra Behn, the first professional female novelist in English.Todd p. 16.Aphra Behn modelled the rake Willmore in her play The Rover on Rochester;Willmore may have also been based on Behn's lover John Hoyle. \" Behn, Mrs Afra\" in The Oxford Companion to English Literature (2000).

Edward Bysshe would include numerous quotations from her verse in his Art of English Poetry (1702).See online text at UVA While her poetry was occasionally sexually frank, it was never as graphic or intentionally lurid and titillating as Rochester's. Rather, her poetry was, like the court's ethos, playful and honest about sexual desire. One of the most remarkable aspects of Behn's success in court poetry, however, is that Behn was herself a commoner. She had no more relation to peers than Dryden, and possibly quite a bit less. As a woman, a commoner, and Kentish, she is remarkable for her success in moving in the same circles as the King himself. As Janet Todd and others have shown, she was likely a spy for the Royalist side during the Interregnum. She was certainly a spy for Charles II in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, but found her services unrewarded (in fact, she may have spent time in debtor's prison) and turned to writing to support herself.\"Behn, Aphra\" in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2007).
