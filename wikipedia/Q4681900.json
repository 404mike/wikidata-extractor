For many years, Len was programme's central male character, appearing in more episodes than anyone else in 1962, 1965, 1966 and 1972. A key element of the character was his relationship with Elsie Tanner. Despite a mutual attraction between the pair, the writers never allowed Len and Elsie to get together, as writer Adele Rose explains: \"The value of their relationship was always in the spikiness underneath the genuine affection they had for each other. It was far more profitable in terms of story and character to keep them with the love-hate relationship going on. He was the one who could say things to her that nobody else could and vice versa. If we ever brought it to any kind of conclusion, that would have been the end of both the characters' value to the show.\"50 Years of Coronation Street: The (very) Unofficial Story, Sean Egan, 2010", "Len's last appearance before Adamson's leave of absence in Episode 2307 stood as the character's swansong, and seven months later he was killed off, dying off-screen in a motorway collision while returning home from his hitherto secret mistress Marjorie Proctor. \"Of course the public saw this as another twist of the knife,\" said Bill Podmore, \"and Peter traded on their sympathy. He had been a professional actor long enough to realise that if a character of Len's fame was to be killed off, the sacrifice would only be made with the help of the most dramatic story-line possible.

In Rose's line of reasoning, Deirdre would strongly believe that Ken was neglecting her, and that being with Mike would make her feel alive. In the widely viewed episode in which Deirdre confessed all to Ken, she told him that she felt like \"the wallpaper, or a piece of furniture that's been around forever... it's like [they've] been married for twenty years.\" In an unscripted move, Ken, blinded by anger, grabbed Deirdre by the throat and started to strangle her. Anne Kirkbride, who did not know of the sudden change in direction, reacted with more conviction, she admitted later, than had she known of the action beforehand. Eventually, Deirdre began to have doubts about staying with Mike Baldwin. The writers of the series scheduled the episode, in which Deirdre reconciled with Ken, effectively ending her relationship with Mike Baldwin, on the night that popular football teams Manchester United and Arsenal F.C. played at Old Trafford. At the end of the episode, which aired on 23 February 1983, Deirdre slammed the door of No. 1 in Mike's face. Dejected and with a shattered hubris, Mike drove away from the Street. As soon as the credits finished rolling, the scoreboard at the stadium read \"Deirdre and Ken United Again!\" and \"Ken 1 Mike 0\" in big letters, to the excitement of cheering fans. The episode was one of the highest-rated in Corrie's history."]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish writers", "response": ["*Adele Rose, television script writer"]}, {"page": "List of Special Branch episodes", "response": ["| Adele Rose "]}, {"page": "Rose (surname)", "response": ["*Adele Rose (1933\u20132020), English television writer"]}, {"page": "Together (1980 TV series)", "response": ["The series concerns the residents of a fictitious housing association block of flats named Rutherford Court.
