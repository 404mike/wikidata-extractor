Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand.Fingleton, p. 141. This brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd.Perry (2005), p. 243. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop;Perry (2005), p. 244. the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling.Fingleton, p. 143. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no-balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no-balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.Fingleton, pp. 141\u2013142. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again and this time the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80."]}, {"page": "Dai Davies (umpire)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dai Davies (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Dai Davies (1923\u20131939) : D.
