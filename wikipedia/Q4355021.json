The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad was named after the two rivers the company hoped to connect; the Hudson river in Albany and the Mohawk river in Schenectady. The state of New York had a set of waterways between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes which had been used for transport since before colonization. These waterways would become the basis for the Erie Canal between Albany and Buffalo in 1825. It was during this time that railroads were being considered as a faster, more efficient alternative to waterways.
