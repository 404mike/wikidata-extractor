He is known for developing the Morris water navigation task, for proposing the concept of synaptic tagging (along with Uwe Frey), and for his work on the function of the hippocampus.He is the director of the Centre for Cognitive and Neural Systems (Edinburgh) and the Wolfson Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh. Since 1994 he has been a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and since 1997, he has been a fellow of the Royal Society. Morris was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2007.Morris, together with Tim Bliss (Francis Crick Institute) and Graham Collingridge (University of Bristol) were named as winners of the 2016 Brain Prize for their discoveries about the way synaptic connections in the hippocampus are strengthened by stimulation. The process, known as long-term potentiation (LTP), forms the basis of the ability to learn and to remember.He was elected Member of the National Academy of Sciences in April 2020.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Morris water navigation task", "response": ["The Morris water navigation task was conceived by Richard G. Morris (then at the University of St Andrews) in 1981 as an alternative to the radial maze. The test was developed to study spatial learning and how it differed from other forms of associative learning. Originally rats, now more commonly mice, were placed in an open pool and the latency to escape was measured for up to six trials a day for 2\u201314 days. Several variables are used to evaluate an animal's performance. For example, a \"probe trial\" measures how long the test subject spends in the \"target quadrant\" (the quadrant with the hidden platform). More elaborate trials alter the location of the hidden platform, or measure distance spent swimming in the pool before reaching the platform. Over the years, many different versions of this test have been performed with a large amount of variables. For example, neuroscientists examine the effect of differences of sex, weight, strength, stress levels, age, and strain of species. The results vary dramatically, so researchers cannot draw conclusions unless these variables are kept constant. Many different size pools have been used throughout the history of this task, but it has been shown that this does not have a significant impact on the results of the test. In early versions of the task, researchers only timed latency to escape, however video tracking devices are now routinely used to measure the path to escape, time spent in each quadrant, and distance traveled in the pool."]}, {"page": "Nicholas Rawlins", "response": ["His most cited paper is entitled \"Place navigation impaired in rats with hippocampal lesions\", published in Nature in 1982 jointly with Richard G.

Morris; it seeks to explain how neural signaling at a particular synapse creates a target for subsequent plasticity-related product (PRP) trafficking essential for sustained LTP and LTD.  Although the molecular identity of the tags remains unknown, it has been established that they form as a result of high or low frequency stimulation, interact with incoming PRPs, and have a limited lifespan."]}, {"page": "Timothy Bliss", "response": ["In 1973, he and Terje L\u00f8mo published the first evidence of a Hebb-like synaptic plasticity event induced by brief tetanic stimulation, known as long-term potentiation (LTP).Tim V.
