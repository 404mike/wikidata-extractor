He took over Best & Lloyd, his father's light industrial engineering works in Birmingham, having previously trained as a metal designer at art school in D\u00fcsseldorf. He went on to design the Bestlite, an iconic Bauhaus-styled desk lamp that remains in production and was used by Winston Churchill in Whitehall.\nBest was an early apostle of the posture therapist F.M. Alexander of the Alexander technique, campaigned for better art-school education for industrial apprentices, and was a founder of the Common Wealth Party in 1942. His social circle included a group of Birmingham artists and intellectuals including Prof. Philip Sargant Florence and others associated with Birmingham University. He also befriended Nikolaus Pevsner during Pevsner's 15 months in Birmingham between 1934-5, and hosted the first visit of Walter Gropius to the Midlands after Gropius's departure from Germany in 1934.\nBest wrote prolifically, though only one of his books was published in his lifetime: Brass Chandelier, his history of his father's experiments with metal manufacturing and promotion of progressive German pedagogic ideas, which Pevsner reviewed in the Architectural Review.\nBest's history of his own early life and that of his younger brother Frank, both of whom served in the First World War, was published posthumously in 2020 as From Bedales to the Boche.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Common Wealth Party", "response": ["Common Wealth was founded on 26 July 1942 in World War II by the alliance of two left-wing groups: the 1941 Committee \u2013 a think tank centred on Picture Post owner Edward G.

In particular, Best complained about Alexander's explanations and dismissive responses to pupils, and his expectation of unquestioning acceptance of his work. He viewed Alexander as limited in his perspective, with little awareness of the artistic and spiritual, and constrained by the view that he had the solution to all problems in life that his approach answered."]}, {"page": "Art of Birmingham", "response": ["Birmingham was the only area of England in the interwar period to follow the German example in emphasising the importance of design for industrial processes as well as traditional craft-based production, teaching courses in industrial design in metals and plastics  at the Birmingham School of Art, and holding an \"Exhibition of Midland Industrial Art\" at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 1934 that attracted 28,000 visitors.
