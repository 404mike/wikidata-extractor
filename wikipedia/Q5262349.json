He took over 100 wickets in 20 consecutive seasons of first-class cricket, but only played in seven Tests for England.  As of 2007, he has the seventh-highest tally of first-class wickets, and the most first-class wickets of any player who began his career after World War II.  He holds the record for the most first-class wickets taken by any Hampshire player.\nAfter his cricket playing career ended, Shackleton became a coach and umpire for several seasons.The cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted of Shackleton, \"his bowling, like his hair, always seemed immaculate\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 12", "response": ["*1924 \u2013 Derek Shackleton, English cricketer, coach, and umpire (d. 2007)"]}, {"page": "Todmorden", "response": ["England Test cricketers Peter Lever (born 1940) and Derek Shackleton (1924\u20132007) were originally from Todmorden."]}, {"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["In 1963 Frank Worrell led an exciting West Indies team on their tour of England. They won the First Test at Old Trafford by an innings, with Cowdrey being bowled round his legs by Hall for 4 after swaying away from a delivery which kept lower than he expected. The Second Test at Lord's was one of the best he played in. Fred Trueman took 6/100 and Cowdrey three catches to dismiss the tourists for 301 and the captain Ted Dexter thrashed Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith round the ground for 70 off 75 balls in England's reply of 297. Dexter couldn't field due to an injury taken when batting so Cowdrey led the team and took 3 more catches as Trueman took 5/52 and the West Indies' 229 relied almost entirely on Basil Butcher's 133. Needing 234 to win England were reduced to 31/3, but had recovered to 72/3 when Cowdrey fended a bouncer from Hall off his face and broke his wrist, retiring hurt on 19. Ken Barrington (60) and Brian Close (70) took England to the verge of victory and when Derek Shackleton was run out in the last over they were 228/9, needing five runs to tie, six runs to win, one wicket to lose or to survive two balls for a draw. Cowdrey returned to the crease with his arm in plaster and stood at the non-striker's end while Dave Allen blocked the last two balls for a draw. England won the Third Test, but lost the series 3\u20131 and Cowdrey was unable to play for the rest of the season."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Derek Shackleton"]}, {"page": "Brian Statham", "response": ["In the Test series, he was chosen for the second match at Lord's but had little to do as it was a spinner's wicket and his Lancashire colleague Roy Tattersall took twelve for 101, England winning to level the series one-all. He kept his place in the third Test at Old Trafford but, while his opening partner Bedser took twelve, he was only needed for a total of 24 overs. In the last two Tests, the selectors decided to pair first Trevor Bailey and then Derek Shackleton with Bedser, but Statham was content as he was certainly in the Test picture and his potential was recognised.Derlien, pages 31 and 32.", "One of the few matches on the tour to provide a wicket with any life in it was the second international against Pakistan in Karachi. On the first day, both teams were dismissed for low scores with most of the wickets falling to pace or seam bowlers. Fazal Mahmood took six for 40 as MCC were bundled out for only 123; and then Statham with four for 32 and Derek Shackleton with four for 50 dismissed Pakistan for 130. Batting conditions improved on the second and third days. MCC totalled 291 in their second innings, Tom Graveney scoring 123, and set Pakistan a target of 285 which they achieved to win by four wickets.Pakistan v MCC scorecard, Karachi 1951. CricketArchive.", "In 1963, Statham's county form on over-grassed pitches was back to something close to his best but, on the less grassy surface of Old Trafford in the first Test against the West Indies, his bowling lacked its old venom. He was surprisingly replaced by the veteran seamer Derek Shackleton for the rest of the series. This move was heavily criticised in the press because it was well known that the Lord's pitch helped fast bowlers. Later in the season, Statham took five wickets in the first-ever limited overs match, for Lancashire against Leicestershire in the preliminary round of the new Gillette Cup tournament. Lancashire again struggled in the County Championship and finished fifteenth. Statham's tally was 113 at 16.58 with a best return of seven for 96."]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Phil Mead is the club's leading run-scorer with 48,892\u00a0runs in 700\u00a0matches for Hampshire between 1905 and 1936. Fast bowler Derek Shackleton took 2,669\u00a0wickets in 583\u00a0first-class matches between 1948 and 1969 which remains a club record. Alec Kennedy, whose career lasted from 1907 to 1936, was the first player to score 10,000\u00a0runs and take 1,000\u00a0wickets for Hampshire. Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie was both Hampshire last amateur captain and first professional captain.", "From 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With Stuart Boyes and Lofty Herman not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from 1929 onwards. In 1937 Dick Moore set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 fours and three sixes. After World War II, Derek Shackleton became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by Victor Cannings, but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and Peter Sainsbury around 100, with Roy Marshall was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time.", "The following years were mixed: a rise to second in 1958 with Malcolm Heath replacing Cannings as Shackleton's partner was followed by two disappointing years before Hampshire won the 1961 County Championship, their first ever County Championship success, finishing the season with 268 points, 18 ahead of Yorkshire. Hampshire won 19 of their 32 matches, losing only seven matches all season. The club were led by Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie with Marshall scoring the most runs for the club with 2,455. Derek Shackleton took the most wickets for the club with 153, and Butch White\u2019s tearaway speed was equally dangerous in a dry summer."]}, {"page": "Wisden Trophy", "response": ["With the growing Caribbean following in England, the West Indies entered the series as one of the most popular touring nations. Lance Gibbs' 11 wickets at Old Trafford set up a commanding 10 wicket win for the West Indies. The second match at Lord's was chiefly remembered for its dramatic ending; all results were possible going into the final over of the match. England required eight runs to win but only had two wickets left. From the fourth ball of the over Derek Shackleton was run out, which meant that Colin Cowdrey had to come out with a broken arm with two balls of the match remaining. He did not have to face a ball, and the match ended in a draw. The third Test saw Fred Trueman claim 12 wickets ensuring England won by 217 runs. Charlie Griffith's 6/36 in the fourth and Conrad Hunte's 108 in the final Test meant the West Indies won the next two Tests and the series finished 3\u20131.

Hampshire's victory in the 1961 County Championship was, in part, due to Ingleby-Mackenzie's bold captaincy: 10 of their 19 victories that season are attributable to bold declarations on the third (and last) day, in a summer when the opposing team could not be made to follow-on. The team included West Indian opening batsman Roy Marshall, veteran swing and seam bowler Derek Shackleton, and fast bowler David White."]}, {"page": "Peter Sainsbury", "response": ["In fact, Hampshire's successes over the next 20 years were built largely on seam bowling, first with Derek Shackleton and later, at the end of Sainsbury's career, with Andy Roberts, and Sainsbury took 100 wickets in a season only once more: 16 years later, in 1971. With no great spin, he was often used defensively as a bowler, but he took 50 or more wickets in 16 seasons. He was also successful in one-day cricket, one of the first slow bowlers to be used successfully in a form of cricket that was dominated in its early days by seam bowling. Indeed, in 1965 he became the first man to take seven wickets in a one-day match when he claimed 7\u201330 against Norfolk in the first round of the Gillette Cup."]}, {"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 2,857 wickets || Derek Shackleton (Hampshire and England) ||647|| 18.65|| from 1948 to 1969"]}, {"page": "1953 English cricket season", "response": [" || Derek Shackleton ||align=\"right\"| 7318 ||align=\"right\"| 328 ||align=\"right\"| 3070 ||align=\"right\"| 150 || 20.46"]}, {"page": "1958 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden Cricketers of the Year (awarded in the 1959 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack) \u2013 Les Jackson, Roy Marshall, Arthur Milton, John Reid, Derek Shackleton"]}, {"page": "1962 English cricket season", "response": ["ESPNcricinfo has a photograph of Fred Trueman leading out the Players XI for the start of the match at Lord's on 18 July.

The record attendance for a county match was made in 1948, when 10,000 watched Hampshire played Sussex. Hampshire continued to play four matches per season there going into the 1950s.  It was during this time that under the leadership of Desmond Eagar and Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie that the Hampshire team was beginning to become a powerful force in the county game.  Coupled with the batting of Roy Marshall (who in five matches there in 1957 scored 549, an unbeaten record for the ground), Jimmy Gray and Henry Horton, and backed up with the bowling of Derek Shackleton, Victor Cannings and Malcolm Heath, Hampshire had a fairly successful period, finishing runners-up in 1958, before winning the County Championship for the first time in 1961, with Hampshire winning four of their five matches there in that season.  They might have been successful in 1958, had it not been for two draws later in the season at the ground. A new format, List A cricket, was introduced in 1963, two years after its introduction, the ground held its first List A match when Hampshire played Kent in the 1965 Gillette Cup. Six first-class matches had been held there in 1962, before the schedule at the ground was reduced back to five, with the expansion of List A cricket with the Player's County League and John Player League, on average two or three List A matches were held there over the coming seasons. Hampshire were pressing for the Player's County League title in 1969, with a crowd of 8,000 watching their defeat to Essex. Hampshire finished that season's competition one point behind winners Lancashire.  A first-class match in 1971 between Hampshire and the touring Pakistanis saw protests by Bangladeshis protesting Pakistani actions in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time in 1973, though the 1970s saw a gradual reduction in the number of first-class matches held there, by the end of that decade three first-class matches and two List A matches were granted to the ground each season. This decade also saw logistical problems for the ground, when at the Railway End trees were destroyed, whose removal interrupted the batsman line of sight.  As such, no matches were held there in 1975, though the purchase of screens allowed county cricket to return in 1976.  1976 was also not without its problems, when a County Championship match against Yorkshire was interrupted by vandals who had attacked the pitch during the night.
