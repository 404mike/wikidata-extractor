A short time at Oxford United was followed with a four-year spell with Colchester United between 2002 and 2006. After helping Colchester to win promotion out of League One in 2005\u201306, he then spent two seasons with Wycombe Wanderers, before signing with Port Vale in May 2008. He announced his retirement as a professional player in November 2009. However he returned to the game in 2010 with Hungarian side Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC, before becoming a non-league player in England with Droylsden via Telford United in 2011. He spent 2011 at American club F.C. New York, before joining Carolina RailHawks a year later. Over the course of his 17-year professional career he made 583 appearances in all competitions, scoring six goals.\nFollowing his retirement he would spend seven years coaching youth players and girls in the United States, returning to the United Kingdom in 2020 to coach at Llandudno.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Staffordshire University", "response": ["*Sam Stockley, Professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Jamie Guy", "response": ["Guy grew up in the East End of London and studied at Eastbrook Comprehensive School \u2013 also the school of Tony Adams and Paul Konchesky. A former under-15 player at West Ham United, he joined the Colchester United youth team, turning professional at the club in 2004. At the start of the 2004\u201305 season, Guy joined non-league Tiptree United on a one-month loan. He came through the ranks at parent club Colchester to make his senior debut at Layer Road in a 1\u20130 defeat to Blackpool on 5 February 2005. He replaced Sam Stockley on 82 minutes. Three weeks later he played the last two minutes of a 2\u20130 defeat away at Hull City, this time coming on for Gareth Williams."]}, {"page": "Tommy Fraser", "response": ["Fraser signed with Port Vale on a free transfer in June 2009, linking up with former manager Micky Adams for the 2009\u201310 season. He was appointed as club captain, after impressing in the pre-season. At twenty one years of age, and new to the club, his appointment came as a surprise to some, especially with more senior options in Sam Stockley, Marc Richards and Gareth Owen. However, Adams had faith in the young midfielder's vocal abilities and general leadership qualities. Putting in solid performances in Vale's unbeaten start to the season, he took to the field despite still suffering with an ankle injury. His first goal for the club seemed to come in a 4\u20130 home win over Grimsby Town on 5 September. However, after the match Marc Richards claimed the last touch and therefore took the credit for the goal. Fraser seemed to attract violence; on 25 August, Sheffield Wednesday's Francis Jeffers was sent off for head-butting Fraser, two weeks later Fraser and Aldershot Town captain John Halls almost came to blows before the match had even begun. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. He remained club captain and a first team regular though, striking up a midfield pairing with Anthony Griffith, who he also shared a house with. His performances as captain earned him public praise from assistant manager Geoff Horsfield, though the fans were critical at times of his inconsistency. He found himself the new focus of disgruntled supporters in early 2010, following Danny Glover's demotion to the reserves, and Marc Richards' rising goal tally. Fraser vowed to ignore the booing. He also retained the captain's armband for the next season, and vowed \"to be more mature both on and off the pitch\" in order to be a better captain."]}, {"page": "Lee Sinnott", "response": ["To make a success of the 2008\u201309 season, Sinnott brought in former Hereford United defender John McCombe, and former Middlesbrough midfielder Steve Thompson. Both players cited Sinnott as their reason for joining the club. He also added experienced defender Sam Stockley (Wycombe Wanderers); attacker Rob Taylor (Nuneaton Borough); midfielder Anthony Griffith (Doncaster Rovers); and attacking midfielder Louis Dodds (Leicester City) to the squad. Lee Collins also joined on an extended loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers, and would sign a permanent contract with the club in January. He appointed Stockley as his captain. The team continued to struggle, and on 18 September Sinnott admitted that \"we are looking to improve, without a shadow of a doubt\". However a 4\u20131 home defeat to Macclesfield Town two days later would prove to be Sinnott's last game in charge. He was sacked two days later, with the \"Valiants\" lying in 16th place. Three months on from his sacking, the club were yet to reach a compensation settlement with Sinnott, before an agreement was reached in February 2009. The club went on to finish the season in 18th place under Dean Glover. Despite the poor results Vale picked up during his reign, many of Sinnott's signings would become key players for the club over the next few seasons."]}, {"page": "Tarkan Mustafa", "response": ["Mustafa was with Norwich City as a schoolboy before joining Wimbledon. He failed to make their first team and was released into non-league football. He joined Kettering Town for the 1996\u201397 season, leaving to join Barnet at the end of the season. His league debut came on 16 August 1997 when he played as a second-half substitute for Sam Stockley in the 2\u20131 defeat at home to Exeter City."]}, {"page": "Adam Yates (footballer)", "response": ["Targeted by manager Dean Glover, Port Vale continued the hunt for his signature even after Glover's departure. Yates decided to wait until a manager was appointed before signing for the club, and after Micky Adams was made manager Yates signed a two-year deal with the Vale. He was forced to wait until 22 August before he made his competitive debut for the club, as Sam Stockley had impressed in the right-back position in the pre-season and opening few games of the 2009\u201310 season. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. Following Stockley's retirement in November, Yates was expected to fill the void, though he faced competition for the right wing-back spot from Anthony Griffith. In his first game in almost a month he scored his first goal at Vale Park, scoring the opener of a 1\u20131 draw with Stevenage Borough in the FA Cup First Round. By February 2010 he was managing to maintain a first-team place, helped by the team's change of formation from 3\u20134\u20133 to 4\u20134\u20132."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["| 2 || DF || align=\"left\"|  Sam Stockley ||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||1"]}, {"page": "Samuel Stockley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Stockley"]}, {"page": "Samuel Joshua Stockley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Stockley"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC season", "response": ["|Sam Stockley"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Sam Stockley"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|25||Sam Stockley||FB||||Tiverton||||137||2|| Oxford United||31 October 2002||Free transfer", "|Sam Stockley", "|align=\"left\"|Sam Stockley", "|align=\"left\"|Sam Stockley"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|25||Sam Stockley||FB||||Tiverton||||93||1|| Oxford United||31 October 2002||Free transfer", "|align=\"left\"|Sam Stockley", "|align=\"left\"|Sam Stockley"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|25||Sam Stockley||FB||||Tiverton||||35||1|| Oxford United||31 October 2002||Free transfer", "|align=\"left\"|Sam Stockley"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|25||Sam Stockley||FB||||Tiverton||||11||1|| Oxford United||31 October 2002||Free transfer", "|Sam Stockley", "|Sam Stockley", "|align=\"left\"|Sam Stockley", "|align=\"left\"|Sam Stockley", "|Sam Stockley", "|Sam Stockley"]}]}}
