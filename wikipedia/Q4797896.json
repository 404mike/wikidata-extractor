Woods' films were mainly quota quickies but were diverse in style, from light comedy and musicals to dark crime thrillers.  His most acclaimed film is 1938's They Drive by Night.  By the end of the 1930s Woods was gaining a reputation as one of Britain's most promising and versatile young directors, but put his career on hold to volunteer for war service in the Royal Air Force, the only British film director to do so.  He was killed while on active service in February 1944, leaving his potential largely unfulfilled.", "link_mentions": {}}}
