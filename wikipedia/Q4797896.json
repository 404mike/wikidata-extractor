Woods' films were mainly quota quickies but were diverse in style, from light comedy and musicals to dark crime thrillers.  His most acclaimed film is 1938's They Drive by Night.  By the end of the 1930s Woods was gaining a reputation as one of Britain's most promising and versatile young directors, but put his career on hold to volunteer for war service in the Royal Air Force, the only British film director to do so.  He was killed while on active service in February 1944, leaving his potential largely unfulfilled.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Arthur B.

He showed a knack for playing comedy, and his 1930s films fell mainly into this genre, with occasional ventures into straight drama and thrillers. Purdell's screenwriting career began in 1932 and he was most productive in this field during the late 1930s, with only occasional ventures later in his career. He tried his hand at film directing in 1937 with two comedies Don't Get Me Wrong, a Max Miller vehicle co-directed with Arthur B. Woods, and Patricia Gets Her Man. Both films were reasonably well-received, but Purdell appears to have decided that directing was not for him, as there would be no more ventures in this area."]}]}}
