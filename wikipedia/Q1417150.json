Under her father's tutelage she developed a badminton game notable for its power, accuracy, and consistency. After dominating U.S. junior competition she won her first (adult) U.S. championship event, women's doubles, with her older sister Susan Devlin in 1953. This marked the beginning of the run of success listed below.  She married Dick Hashman in 1960, living in England thereafter and eventually becoming a British citizen.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Maryland", "response": ["*Judy Devlin, badminton player"]}, {"page": "All England Open Badminton Championships", "response": ["| Judy Devlin", "| Sue Devlin Judy Devlin", "| Sue Devlin Judy Devlin", "|rowspan=\"2\"| Judy Devlin", "| Judy Devlin", "| Sue Devlin Judy Devlin", "| Judy Devlin|| || 10 ||  || 7 || ||17", ": \u2013 Judy Devlin later known as Judy Hashman "]}, {"page": "1957 Uber Cup", "response": ["3 singles and 4 doubles (2 doubles, then reversed).
