In 1967, he was playing services cricket for the Army and the Combined Services cricket teams, while also appearing in second eleven matches for Somerset.Carter moved into Somerset's first team for the final two matches of the 1968 season following the decision of regular wicket-keeper Dickie Brooks not to continue a first-class cricket career. Though Carter scored only one run in his four innings that season, he was handed a contract for 1969 and played in all 24 County Championship matches in the 1969 season, though Trevor Holmes was picked for the other first-class fixture against the West Indians. In an unsuccessful season for Somerset \u2013 the county finished bottom of the Championship table for the first time since 1955 \u2013 Carter was singled out for praise in Wisden. He was, it said, \"extremely enthusiastic\" and had \"developed into a most capable performer\". He appeared less frequently in one-day cricket: the 1969 season was the first season of the new John Player League, a 40-over competition played on Sundays, but Carter played in only a few matches, Somerset generally preferring the more reliable batting of Roy Virgin, who could keep wicket adequately.\nAt the end of the season, Carter went into business and did not play first-class cricket again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Carter", "response": ["*Charlie Carter (cricketer) (born 1947), English cricketer", "*Charlie Carter (born 1971), Irish hurler", "*Charlie Carter (footballer) (born 1996), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Charlie Carter (1968\u20131969) 26 matches CA"]}]}}
