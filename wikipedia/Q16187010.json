Virtually all networking now uses TCP/IP, but multiprotocol routers are still manufactured. They were important in the early stages of the growth of computer networking when protocols other than TCP/IP were in use. Modern routers that handle both IPv4 and IPv6 are multiprotocol but are simpler devices than ones processing AppleTalk, DECnet, IP, and Xerox protocols."]}, {"page": "Comparison of file transfer protocols", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left\" | Trivial File Transfer Protocol || TFTP || Noel Chiappa || 1980 || Internet protocol suite ||  || "]}, {"page": "List of Internet pioneers", "response": ["A plaque commemorating the \"Birth of the Internet\" was dedicated at a conference on the history and future of the internet on 28 July 2005 and is displayed at the Gates Computer Science Building, Stanford University.
