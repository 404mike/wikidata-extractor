The first in New France was Robert Giffard, who arrived in Quebec City in 1627 and \"practised\" at H\u00f4tel-Dieu, Canada's first hospital, a very modest four-room structure founded by the church. The panacea was bleeding, which involved the use of a knife to cut open a blood vessel and drain away a quantity of the patient's blood. There was some surgery, but it was undertaken with primitive instruments and without anesthetic or any familiarity with the concept of infection. Both the procedure and results were usually quite gruesome. Another figure of repute, Michel Sarrazin, a botanist as well as doctor, arrived from France in the latter half of the 17th century and served as the surgeon-major for the French troops in New France. He, too, practised at Hotel-Dieu and while there treated hundreds of patients infected during a typhus epidemic. Eyeglasses for the correction of vision became available at this time. The mercury thermometer, invented in 1714, became a useful diagnostic tool for doctors as did the stethoscope invented in 1816. Because doctors were few and far between people with medical problems often had to treat themselves. They used Indian medicines or home remedies based on the internal and external application of various herbal and animal products. Advances in surgery came in the early 19th century with the innovative work of Dr. Christopher Widmer who practised at York Hospital (later known as Toronto General Hospital) and R.W. Beaumont made a name as a noted inventor of surgical instruments. The early part of the 19th century also witnessed the first halting steps with respect to the use of inoculation in Nova Scotia, in this case against smallpox. However, it would take another one hundred years for the practice to become widespread. General hospitals were established in Montreal in 1819 and York ( now Toronto) in 1829."]}, {"page": "William Rawlins Beaumont", "response": ["While at St Barts, which was a modern medical school, Beaumont was a student with James Paget.

He became professor of surgery at King's College in 1843, attending physician and surgeon to the Toronto General Hospital and its consulting physician and surgeon when Christopher Widmer died in 1858."]}, {"page": "List of lost buildings and structures in Toronto", "response": ["| Christopher Widmer House"]}, {"page": "Widmer, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Widmer"]}]}}
