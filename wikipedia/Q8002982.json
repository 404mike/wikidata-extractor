His brother Thomas was a first-class umpire.\nA right-handed batsman and slow underarm bowler who played for Surrey County Cricket Club, he made 191 known appearances in first-class matches.  He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series.  \nMortlock sometimes opened the innings and he scored a total of 5528 runs at an average of 18.73 with a highest score of 106.  He made three career centuries.  A versatile fielder, he took 85 catches.  He took 147 wickets with underarm bowling at 18.02 with a best analysis of 7/42 and he twice claimed ten wickets in a match. Haygarth considered his lob bowling 'rubbish'. Mortlock participated in the first cricket tour of Australia in 1861-2. The team travelled to Australia on the SS Great Britain.  It was on this tour that Mortlock gained the nickname 'Old Stonewall' for his stubborn defensive batting. \nMortlock died at his home in Acre Lane, Brixton on 23 January 1884, after an illness that had incapacitated him for two years. He was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
