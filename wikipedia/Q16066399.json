This was built in 1832 in seven weeks, at a cost of \u00a33,000. The theatre opened on 15 January 1832, as Rayner's New Subscription Theatre, with a production of Struggles at Starting. Within weeks, the venture failed and was sold to the actress Harriet Waylett, re-opening on 29 May as The New Strand (Subscription) Theatre with Damp Beds. Again, the theatre lacked support and closed in November 1832. The theatre was re-opened in early 1833 as the  New Strand Theatre, by Frances Maria Kelly \u2013 who also based a drama school there. The singer, Rebecca Isaacs was the Directress of Operas at the theatre from 1852 to 1853, and again in 1855. The theatre failed because it was unlicensed, and this put it into competition with London's patent theatres. Presenting plays by subscription was one method of evading the Acts, but tickets could not be sold at the theatre. This was circumvented by selling them at neighbouring shops; and at one point the public were admitted free on purchase of an ounce of rose lozenges for four shillings (stalls), or half an ounce of peppermint drops for two shillings (the pit) from the neighbouring confectioners."]}, {"page": "Frederick Henry Yates", "response": ["In 1833 he brought with him Harriet Waylett to perform at King's Lynn theatre."]}, {"page": "Playhouse, Sleaford", "response": ["at the theatre.
