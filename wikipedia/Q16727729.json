He said; \"the only way anybody's listening\" to the stories of abuse within the group \"is that Rick and Angela died\". He also said Rodriguez' suicide brought the total of suicides in his peer group to 30, but that he considered Rodriguez' abuse to be one of the worst cases from The Family. John LaMattery, a former second-generation leader, said Rodriguez' death was \"a monumental event\" in the group's history and predicted The Family would \"spin it\" in an attempt to disregard unfulfilled prophecies, saying the cult was in \"damage control\". He also believed Rodriguez killed Smith because he could not find Zerby. After Rodriguez' death, former members of The Family made similar allegations of abuse. For example, Juliana Buhring, co-author of the book Not Without My Sister (which details her family's experiences within the cult), mentioned that most of the children she and people like Rodriguez grew up with in the cult were sexually abused. She empathized with the rage he felt, especially when he had \"no closure\" and \"no restitution\" to it."]}, {"page": "List of circumnavigations", "response": ["* Juliana Buhring completed the first cycling circumnavigation by a solo female in 2012 following updated Guinness World Record rules for a cycling circumnavigation.
