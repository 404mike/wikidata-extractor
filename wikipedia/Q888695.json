He was Chelsea's all-time top scorer for 47 years, with 202 goals in all competitions until Frank Lampard surpassed this total on 11 May 2013. Tambling remains Chelsea's all-time top scorer in league competition with 164 goals. After enjoying a successful career in the Football League during the 1960s and early 1970s, Tambling moved to Ireland.

Eight other players have also scored over 100 goals for Chelsea: George Hilsdon (1906\u20131912), George Mills (1929\u20131939), Roy Bentley (1948\u20131956), Jimmy Greaves (1957\u20131961), Peter Osgood (1964\u20131974 and 1978\u20131979), Kerry Dixon (1983\u20131992), Didier Drogba (2004\u20132012 and 2014\u20132015), and Eden Hazard (2012\u20132019). Greaves holds the club record for the most goals scored in one season (43 in 1960\u201361). While a Chelsea player, Greaves also became the youngest ever player to score 100 goals in the English top-flight, at 20 years and 290 days."]}, {"page": "Peter Bonetti", "response": ["Chelsea were relegated in Bonetti's second full season, which saw the appointment of Tommy Docherty as manager. Bonetti emerged as a key figure in a talented young team which included Bobby Tambling, Terry Venables, John Hollins and Barry Bridges. The team went into the penultimate match of the season needing to beat promotion rivals Sunderland to have a chance of going up.

On 12 January 2013, Lampard scored a penalty in the 4\u20130 win over Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium.

He soon made his presence felt when he punched club legend Dave Mackay during training, though no long-term rift developed because of the incident. Spurs went on to have a good 1966\u201367 season though, finishing third in the league and beating Millwall (after a replay), Portsmouth, Bristol City, Birmingham City (after a replay) and Nottingham Forest to reach the 1967 FA Cup Final to face his former club Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. Spurs won the cup with a 2\u20131 victory, Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul providing the goals before Bobby Tambling scored a late consolation goal for Chelsea. Ironically, earlier in the season Venables had bet \u00a325 on Chelsea to win the cup at odds of 25/1, which would have paid out \u00a3500 if Spurs had lost the game, exactly the same figure as the \u00a3500 cup bonus he would receive for winning the match; in fact after tax deductions, Venables would have been better off financially if Chelsea had won."]}, {"page": "1984 in Ireland", "response": ["*Cork City F.C. founded and elected to the League of Ireland Premier Division.

The championship-winning side was gradually broken up, to be replaced by the crop of youngsters emerging from the club's youth team, such as Jimmy Greaves, Peter Brabrook and Bobby Tambling, for whom Drake was an aloof figure.
