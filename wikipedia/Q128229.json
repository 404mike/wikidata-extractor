In the Middle Ages, zealotic and ascetic religious movements emerged, which rejected institutions, laws and the established order. In the 18th century another anarchist stream emerged based on rationalism and logic. These two currents of anarchism later blended to form a contradictory movement that resonated with a very broad audience."]}, {"page": "Anarky", "response": ["Literary cues illustrated into scenes were occasionally used whenever Anarky was a featured character in a comic. During the Anarky limited series, fluttering newspapers were used to bear headlines alluding to social problems. Occasionally, the titles of books found in Anarky's room would express the character's philosophical, political, or generally esoteric agenda. In both Detective Comics #620 and Batman: Shadow of the Bat #40, a copy of V for Vendetta can be seen on Lonnie Machin's bookshelf as homage. Other books in his room at different times have included Apostles of Revolution by Max Nomad, The Anarchists by James Joll, books labeled \"Proudhon\" and \"Bakunin\", and an issue of Black Flag. Non-anarchist material included books labeled \"Plato\", \"Aristotle\", and \"Swedenborg\", and a copy of Synergetics, by Buckminster Fuller. The character also made references to Universe by Scudder Klyce, an extremely rare book. When asked if he was concerned readers would be unable to follow some of the more obscure literary references, Grant explained that he hadn't expected many to do so, but reported encountering some who had, and that one particular reader of the 1999 Anarky series had carried out an ongoing correspondence with him on the topic as of 2005."]}, {"page": "Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles", "response": ["In 1942, Luigi Albertini published The Origins of the War of 1914 and concluded that Germany was primarily responsible for the outbreak of the war.

The issue came back between 1959 and 1969, when Fritz Fischer in Germany's Aims in the First World War and War of Illusions \"destroyed the consensus about shared responsibility for the First World War\" and \"placed the blame\u00a0... firmly on the shoulders of the Wilhelmine elite.\" By the 1970s, his work \"had emerged as the new orthodoxy on the origins of the First World War\".

In 2002, Hobsbawm was described by right-leaning magazine The Spectator as \"arguably our greatest living historian\u2014not only Britain's, but the world's\", while Niall Ferguson wrote: \"That Hobsbawm is one of the great historians of his generation is undeniable\u00a0...

Nothing else produced by the British Marxist historians will endure as these books will.\" In 2003, The New York Times described him as \"one of the great British historians of his age, an unapologetic Communist and a polymath whose erudite, elegantly written histories are still widely read in schools here and abroad\". James Joll wrote in The New York Review of Books that \"Eric Hobsbawm's nineteenth century trilogy is one of the great achievements of historical writing in recent decades\". Mark Mazower wrote of his historical writings being \"about trends, social forces, large-scale change over vast distances. Telling that kind of history in a way that is as compelling as a detective story is a real challenge of style and composition: in the tetralogy, Hobsbawm shows how to do it.\" Ian Kershaw said that Hobsbawm's take on the twentieth century, his 1994 book, The Age of Extremes, consisted of \"masterly analysis\". Meanwhile, Tony Judt, while praising Hobsbawm's vast knowledge and graceful prose, cautioned that Hobsbawm's bias in favour of the USSR, communist states and communism in general, and his tendency to disparage any nationalist movement as passing and irrational, weakened his grasp of parts of the 20th century."]}, {"page": "Gordon Martel", "response": ["In 2006, Martel revised and expanded James Joll's The Origins of the First World War.", "*The Origins of the First World War.
