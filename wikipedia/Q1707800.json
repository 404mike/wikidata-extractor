However, by the end of his tenure, he had declared Bevan as \"the best minister we have had\". Clement Attlee expressed his support that Bevan should have been the leader of the Labour Party during his lifetime but was held back by his demeanour, stating \"he wants to be two things simultaneously, rebel and official leader, and you can't be both\"."]}, {"page": "List of current members of the British Privy Council", "response": ["| Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell"]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell"]}, {"page": "Peter Inge, Baron Inge", "response": ["In 2004 Inge was made a Privy Councillor and appointed to serve as a member of the Butler Inquiry team, which examined the use of intelligence during the Iraq War.
