Samaranch had already declared his intention to add triathlon to the Olympic games as fast as possible, and assured that triathlon could appear as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona but only under the auspices of the International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon (UIPMB). Many within the triathlon community were unhappy with the arrangement wishing for their own federation not to be held as part of UIPMB. Unable to accept the offer, Samaranch established an Olympic working committee for triathlon in an effort to form a consensus on an Olympic route for the sport.

The then IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch held a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden with the intention of making triathlon an Olympic sport as soon as possible.

In August 2000, the year following the trial, Dan Empfield wrote that Sutton had also paid a price, both professionally and personally. You cannot be more persona non grata than he is in the world of short-course triathlon. Not only has he been booted out of Triathlon Australia, his athletes have been the subject of persecution as well. Both the ITU and TA have made it clear that if you, as an athlete, are coached by Sutton you do so at your own peril. Sutton replied, \"The price most people think I paid is nothing compared to how I really paid every day since\" and that \"I understand people's right to hold me in contempt.\"", "Some athletes have experienced criticism for joining Sutton's squad, or have actually been discriminated against as a result of doing so. In May 2000, Sutton wrote, \"The sport does not have the right, either morally or legally, to persecute athletes who have done nothing wrong\", outlining discrimination against Loretta Harrop, whom he described as the \"undisputed best in the world\", Andrew Johns (\"the best human being alive\"), Siri Lindley (\"one of nature's kindest\") and Joanne King, who won the 1998 world championship, but remained largely ignored because of her association with Sutton.
