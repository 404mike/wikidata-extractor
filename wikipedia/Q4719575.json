He was born in County Sligo in 1886.\nHe was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Sligo South at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, though McCabe did not attend as he was in prison.At the 1921 Irish elections, he was re-elected for Sligo\u2013Mayo East. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted in favour of it. He was again re-elected for Sligo\u2013Mayo East at the 1922 general election, this time as pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD). During the Treaty debate he asserted that the  counties of Ulster which comprised \"Northern Ireland\" could never be incorporated into an Irish Republic while the British Empire was what it was.At the 1923 general election, he was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD for Leitrim\u2013Sligo. He resigned from Cumann na nGaedheal in 1924 because of dissatisfaction with government attitude to certain army officers and joined the National Party led by Joseph McGrath.\nHe resigned his D\u00e1il seat in March 1925 along with several other TDs, and at the resulting by-election on 11 March 1925 was won by the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate Martin Roddy. He did not stand for public office again and returned to his post as a schoolteacher.\nIn the 1930s he was involved with the short-lived but widely followed Irish Christian Front, serving as the organisation's secretary and announcing its creation to the public on 22 August 1936. He was also a member of the Blueshirts during this period and the later the Irish Friends of Germany (later known as the 'National Club') during the Second World War, a would-be Nazi Collaborator group in the event Germany invaded Ireland. McCabe chaired their meetings, denied the group was a fifth column and expressed the belief that a German victory would lead to a United Ireland. He was interned in 1940\u20131941 because of his pro-German sympathies, which he claimed resulted from the desire to \u2018see the very life-blood squeezed out of England\u2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1972 in Ireland", "response": ["* 31 May \u2013 Alexander McCabe, Sinn F\u00e9in party Member of Parliament, member of First D\u00e1il, Cumann na nGaedheal party TD (born 1886)."]}, {"page": "C\u00f3ras na Poblachta", "response": ["Many members of the Irish far-right joined C\u00f3ras na Poblachta including Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Cuinneag\u00e1in, who became the leader of the party's youth wing Aic\u00e9in and would go on to found Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe, Alexander McCabe, Maurice O'Connor and Reginald Eager from the Irish Friends of Germany, George Griffin, Patrick Moylett, his brother John and Joseph Andrews of the People's National Party, Dermot Brennan of Saoirse Gaedheal, and Hugh O'Neill and Alexander Carey of C\u00f3ras Gaedhealach.
