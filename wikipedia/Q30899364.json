The first play I wrote, I didn't really know it was a play, it was just for me. I would read it over the phone to my friend and when I'd finished he said I had to show it to someone. Talawa Theatre Company found me and [artistic director] Michael Buffong put that play in a Talawa Firsts show, and I got signed by my agent there ... Talawa completely took a chance on me. I had no training or experience or credentials, and there was no one to offer a reference. But Michael believed in me. It took me forever though, probably until the opening night of Girls at HighTide, for me to believe him.\""]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film", "response": ["| Rocks || Sarah Gavron || Sarah Gavron, Ameenah Ayub Allen, Faye Ward, Theresa Ikoko, Claire Wilson"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay", "response": ["| Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer", "response": ["| Rocks || Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson (Writer)"]}, {"page": "Steven Atkinson", "response": ["At HighTide, Atkinson produced and championed many of the leading new writers of the last decade, including Anders Lustgarten, Luke Barnes, Tallulah Brown, E V Crowe, Elinor Cook, Rob Drummond, Kenny Emson, Kieran Hurley, Theresa Ikoko, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Ella Hickson, Eve Leigh, Vinay Patel, Nick Payne, Beth Steel, Al Smith, Sam Steiner, and Jack Thorne.", "* Girls by Theresa Ikoko, directed by Elyace Ismail (2017)"]}, {"page": "BIFA Award for Best British Independent Film", "response": ["|style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" | Sarah Gavron, Ameenah Ayub Allen, Faye Ward, Theresa Ikoko, Claire Wilson"]}, {"page": "List of black British writers", "response": ["* Theresa Ikoko (living)"]}, {"page": "Rocks (film)", "response": ["|Sarah Gavron, Ameenah Ayub Allen, Faye Ward, Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson", "|Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson", "|Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson", "|rowspan=2|Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson", "|Sarah Gavron, Ameenah Ayub Allen, Faye Ward, Theresa Ikoko, and Claire Wilson", "| Rocks by Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson"]}, {"page": "British Independent Film Awards 2020", "response": ["*Rocks - Sarah Gavron, Ameenah Ayub Allen, Faye Ward, Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson", "*Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson - Rocks", "*Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson - Rocks"]}, {"page": "74th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Rocks \u2013 Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson", "* Rocks \u2013 Sarah Gavron, Ameenah Ayub Allen, Faye Ward, Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson", "* Rocks \u2013 Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson (Writer)"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2021", "response": ["* Theresa Ikoko (Best Original Screenplay, Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer \u2013 Rocks)"]}, {"page": "Kosar Ali", "response": ["Ali was discovered at her school when she was 15 by director Sarah Gavron and casting director Lucy Pardee as they were street casting for the film Rocks.

The collaborative nature  of the project was such that occasionally the actresses were not even told the cameras were rolling, with the director not saying \u201caction\u201d or \u201ccut\u201d, the actresses would just naturally flow into conversation and it would be recorded.
