Born in Penpont, he came to Kilmarnock at age 20, where he lived until his death (obituary 1904).\nHe built, in 1869, two versions of a two-wheeled velocipede with levers and rods tossing a crank on the rear wheel (English Mechanic 5/14/1869 and 6/11/1869). This was a reaction to the French velocipedes, of the mid-1860s, with their front-wheel pedal cranks. In fact, this rear-wheel idea occupied seven more inventors in that year (Lessing 1991).\nWhen in the 1880s a rich corn-trader named James Johnston started a campaign to attribute the \"first true\" bicycle to his uncle Kirkpatrick MacMillan and his native country of Dumfries in general, he attributed the McCall designs to MacMillan and dated them as of 1839. Skeptics allege that the reason McCall built a replica of his machines to be exhibited as MacMillan's at the 1896 Stanley Show, at the behest of Johnston, can only be a need of money (Clayton 1987). That alleged replica is now at Dumfries Observatory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bicycle", "response": ["In the early 1860s, Frenchmen Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical crank drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the velocipede). This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman Thomas McCall in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by Eug\u00e8ne Meyer of Paris.Bulletin des lois de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise (1873) 12th series, vol. 6, p. 648, patent no. 86,705: \"Perfectionnements dans les roues de v\u00e9locip\u00e8des\" (\"Improvements in the wheels of bicycles\"), issued 4 August 1869. The French v\u00e9locip\u00e8de, made of iron and wood, developed into the \"penny-farthing\" (historically known as an \"ordinary bicycle\", a retronym, since there was then no other kind). It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor weight distribution. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the Coventry Machinists Company), brought a Michaux cycle to Coventry, England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner James Starley, used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.McGrory, David.

There is no record of Dalzell ever having laid claim to inventing the machine.  It is believed that he copied the idea having recognised the potential to help him with his local drapery business and there is some evidence that he used the contraption to take his wares into the rural community around his home.  A replica still exists today in the Glasgow Museum of Transport.  The exhibit holds the honour of being the oldest bike in existence today.
