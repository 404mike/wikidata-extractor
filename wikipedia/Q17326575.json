This house, by an unknown designer, was L-shaped in plan with east and north ranges; piecemeal additions were made to it during the 17th\u00a0century. In the 1720s Giacomo Leoni, an architect from Venice, added a south range to the house creating a courtyard plan, and made other changes. While he retained some of its Elizabethan features, many of his changes were in a mixture of Palladian and Baroque styles. During the latter part of the 18th\u00a0century Piers Legh\u00a0XIII bought most of the furniture which is in the house today. However, the family fortunes declined and the house began to deteriorate. In the early 19th\u00a0century the estate was owned by Thomas Legh, who commissioned Lewis Wyatt to restore the house between 1816 and 1822. Wyatt's alterations were mainly to the interior, where he remodelled every room. Leoni had intended to add a cupola to the south range but this never materialised. Instead, Wyatt added a tower-like structure (a hamper) to provide bedrooms for the servants. He also added a one-storey block to the east range, containing a dining-room. Later in the century William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, added stables and other buildings to the estate, and created the Dutch Garden.  Further alterations were made to the gardens by Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton and his wife during the early 20th\u00a0century.  During the Second World War, the park was used as an RAF lorry depot. In 1946 Richard Legh, 3rd Baron Newton, gave Lyme Park to the National Trust. From 1947 the estate was managed by Stockport Corporation and its successor Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council until 1994 when the National Trust took direct control."]}, {"page": "Paymaster General", "response": ["*Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton 1915\u20131916"]}]}}
