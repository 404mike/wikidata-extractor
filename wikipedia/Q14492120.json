Among other contributions, he is known for the Williamson construction of Hadamard matrices.  Williamson graduated from the University of Edinburgh with first-class honours in 1922.  Awarded a Commonwealth Fellowship in 1925, he studied at the University of Chicago under the direction of L. E. Dickson and E. H. Moore, receiving the Ph.D. in 1927.  He held a Lectureship in Mathematics at the University of St Andrews and an Associate Professorship in Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Williamson", "response": ["John Williamson may refer to:", "* John Williamson (singer) (born 1945), Australian singer and songwriter", "* John Williamson (musician) (born 1963), bass guitarist in the band McCarthy", "* John Williamson (album), the 1970 debut album by the Australian singer", "* John Williamson (New Zealand politician) (1815\u20131875), New Zealand politician", "* John Williamson (communist) (1903\u20131974), Scottish-born American Communist leader", "* John Williamson (Canadian politician) (born 1970), Canadian politician", "* John Williamson (footballer, born 1887) (1887\u2013?), English footballer for Sunderland", "* John Williamson (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u2013?), English footballer for Manchester United and Bury", "* John Williamson (footballer, born 1981), English footballer for Burnley", "* John Williamson (basketball, born 1951) (1951\u20131996), American pro basketball player, New York Nets", "* John Williamson (basketball, born 1986), American basketball player in Israel", "* John Williamson Nevin (1803\u20131886), American theologian", "* John Williamson (mathematician) (1901\u20131949), Scottish mathematician", "* John Williamson (geologist) (1907\u20131958), Canadian geologist", "* John Williamson (economist) (1937\u20132021), British professor", "* John Williamson (musicologist) (born 1949), Scottish professor", "* John Williamson (), known by the nickname Johnnie Notions, Shetland smallpox inoculator"]}, {"page": "Williamson conjecture", "response": ["where I is the identity matrix of order n.
