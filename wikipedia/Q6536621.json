After wartime service in the Royal Air Force (RAF), he pursued a career in journalism and joined the London Evening Standard, where he worked from 1952 to 1956. He contributed sketches for radio, including for The Goon Show amongst others. In 1969, he diversified somewhat and devised Who-Dun-It for ATV, an audience participation series.\nGreifer also wrote episodes of The Prisoner (\"The General\", 1967), Crossroads, and the initial draft of the Tom Baker Doctor Who story Pyramids of Mars. The latter script was radically rewritten by script editor Robert Holmes, who used the pseudonym Stephen Harris on the final product. Greifer had meanwhile returned to teach at the University of Tel Aviv, and had little contact with television in his remaining years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)", "response": ["*Pyramids of Mars (from a story by Lewis Greifer)"]}, {"page": "Pyramids of Mars", "response": ["The Universal Pictures film The Mummy (1932) and especially the Hammer horror films The Mummy (1959) and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971) influenced the story.

However, thinking up a credible vehicle for Frank, amiable and charming as he was, proved to me that ultimately you cannot make a celluloid purse out of a sow's ear, even though Frank was gamely willing to send himself up. It was going to have to be a small budget, and to save money I was asked to use a new film saving invention \u2013 the dreaded 'Techniscope' process. By only using two sprocket holes for each frame (instead of the standard four) a narrow negative was created, which had a sort of wide-screen look.
