In 1838, the Congregational church missionary Walter Henry Medhurst considered the Chinese exams to be \"worthy of imitating.\" In 1806, the British established a Civil Service College near London for training of the East India Company's administrators in India. This was based on the recommendations of British East India Company officials serving in China and had seen the Imperial examinations. In 1829, the company introduced civil service examinations in India on a limited basis. This established the principle of qualification process for civil servants in England.Bodde, Derk, Chinese Ideas in the West Committee on Asiatic Studies in American Education  In 1847 and 1856, Thomas Taylor Meadows strongly recommended the adoption of the Chinese principle of competitive examinations in Great Britain. Both Thomas Babington Macaulay, who was instrumental in passing the Saint Helena Act 1833, and Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh, who prepared the Northcote\u2013Trevelyan Report that catalyzed the British civil service, were familiar with Chinese history and institutions. When the report was brought up in parliament in 1853, Lord Monteagle argued against the implementation of open examinations because it was a Chinese system and China was not an \"enlightened country.\" Lord Stanley called the examinations the \"Chinese Principle.\" The Earl of Granville did not deny this but argued in favor of the examination system, considering that the minority Manchus had been able to rule China with it for over 200 years. In 1854, Edwin Chadwick reported that some noblemen did not agree with the measures introduced because they were Chinese. The examination system was finally implemented in the British Indian Civil Service in 1855, prior to which admission into the civil service was purely a matter of patronage, and in England in 1870. Even as late as ten years after the competitive examination plan was passed, people still attacked it as an \"adopted Chinese culture.\" Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington insisted that the English \"did not know that it was necessary for them to take lessons from the Celestial Empire.\" In 1875, Archibald Sayce voiced concern over the prevalence of competitive examinations, which he described as \"the invasion of this new Chinese culture.\"Ssu-yu Teng, \"Chinese Influence on the Western Examination System\", Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 7 (1942\u20131943): 267\u2013312."]}, {"page": "Alexander DRW Baillie-Cochrane", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington "]}, {"page": "Alexander Dundas Ross Wishart Baillie-Cochrane", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington "]}, {"page": "A Baillie-Cochrane", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington"]}, {"page": "Alexander Baillie-Cochrane", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington"]}, {"page": "Alexander Cochrane-Baillie, 1st Baron Lamington", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington"]}, {"page": "Charles Cochrane-Baillie, 2nd Baron Lamington", "response": ["Born in London, England, he was the only son of Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington.
