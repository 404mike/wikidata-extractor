She was created by series producer Russell T Davies and portrayed by Billie Piper. With the revival of Doctor Who in 2005, Rose was introduced as a new travelling companion of the series protagonist, the Doctor, in his ninth and tenth incarnations. The companion character, intended to act as an audience surrogate, was key in the first series to introduce new viewers to the mythos of Doctor Who, which had not aired regularly since 1989. Rose became the viewers' eyes into the new world of the series, from the companion's perspective. Piper received top billing alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant for the duration of her time as a regular cast member. A regular for all of series one (2005) and series two (2006), Piper later returned for three episodes of the programme's fourth series (2008) and appeared in feature-length specials in both 2010 and 2013. In 2013, Piper played a different character for the 50th anniversary known as 'The Moment', projecting Rose's image in her 'Bad Wolf' form.\nIn the series' narrative, Rose is introduced in the eponymous series one premiere as a teenage working class shop assistant from London, alongside her own supporting cast in the form of her mother Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri) and her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke). Over the course of the first series, Rose's human actions and responses contrast with the Doctor's alien perspectives. Rose grows increasingly trusting of the Doctor and comes to realise she has fallen in love with him. He comes to value and depend on her and sacrifices his Ninth incarnation for her. Rose forms a similar bond with the new Doctor, but the two appear to be forever separated in the series two finale, although Rose's temporary return in the fourth series gives her relationship with the Doctor a resolution.\nIn promoting the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic characteristics whilst Davies highlighted her down-to-earth qualities and quintessential \"British-ness\". Critical reaction noted that the character was more developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character's overall role in the narrative of the first two series was praised. However, the reaction to the character's 2008 return was more mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose \u2014including two National Television Awards \u2014and since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular, Piper experienced success in other high-profile roles as an actress which has been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doctor Who", "response": ["Since the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role.

The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs.

For Series 2 in 2006, Cybermen were reintroduced with a new origin story set in a parallel universe. In the \"Rise of the Cybermen\" and \"The Age of Steel\" two-part story, the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companions, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke), crash land in a parallel London where the Cybermen are being created on modern-day Earth. The Cybermen are created by the owner of Cybus Industries, the dying transhumanist mad scientist John Lumic (Roger Lloyd-Pack). Lumic's Cybermen successfully convert much of the world's population by placing their human brains into robotic shells. The Doctor and his friends free London from their control.

His pitch was submitted for the first production meeting in December 2003 and a series of thirteen episodes was obtained by pressure from BBC Worldwide and a workable budget from Julie Gardner.", "The workload of managing three separate shows prompted Davies to delegate writing tasks for Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures to other writers so he could focus on writing Doctor Who. After Billie Piper's departure as Rose Tyler in the second series finale \"Doomsday\", he suggested a third spin-off, Rose Tyler: Earth Defence, a compilation of annual bank holiday specials which followed Rose and a parallel universe version of Torchwood. He later reneged on his idea, as he believed Rose should stay off screen, and abandoned the idea even though it had been budgeted.", "Davies explained in length his writing process to Cook in The Writer's Tale. When he creates characters, he initially assigns a character a name and fits attributes around it. In the case of Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in his inaugural series of Doctor Who, he chose the name because he considered it a \"good luck charm\" after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in Bob & Rose. He presented his desire to make the show \"essentially British\" as another justification: he considered Rose to be \"the most British name in the world\" and feminine enough to subvert the then-current trend of female companions and their \"boyish\" names, such as Benny, Charley, and Ace. While he was writing for The Grand, the executive producer requested that he change the female lead character's name, a decision that led to the \"character never [feeling] right from that moment on\". The surname \"Harkness\", most notably given to Torchwood lead Captain Jack Harkness, is a similar charm, first used in 1993 for the Harkness family in Century Falls, and ultimately derived from the Marvel Universe supporting character Agatha Harkness, and the surname \"Tyler\" is similarly used because of his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced.", "When he creates new scripts, Davies considers the d\u00e9nouement of a story to be representative of the work. He often formulates both the scene and its emotional impact early in the process, but writes the scenes last due to his belief that \"[later scenes] can't exist if they aren't informed by where they've come from\". Davies is a strong advocate for the continued use of the cliffhanger ending and opposes advertising that sacrifices the impact of storytelling. In pursuit of his quest, he instructs editors to remove scenes from press copies of episodes he writes; cliffhangers were removed from the review copies of the Doctor Who episodes \"Army of Ghosts\", \"The Stolen Earth\", and the first part of \"The End of Time\", and Rose Tyler's unadvertised appearance in \"Partners in Crime\" was excised.

This led to the production of further action figures depicting characters and monsters from the programme; three waves of posable 5-inch scale figures, as well as RC Dalek and K9 models were released in 2006. The figures received high praise and won Character the 2006 Toy Retailers Association's Boys Toy of the Year Award. New figures were released regularly, along with larger and 'Collect & Build' figures, an electronic TARDIS control room play set and other in-scale models. From 2007, in favour of waves, figures were marketed under banners based on which series the character a figure depicts appears in.

He eventually parts ways with them all by the end of the 2008 series finale, \"Journey's End\", after which he attempts to travel alone for the duration of the 2008\u20132010 specials before being accompanied by Donna's grandfather Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) on his final adventure in \"The End of Time\".", "The Tenth Doctor speaks with an Estuary English accent, rather than the Lancashire dialect (Christopher Eccleston's own dialect) that the Ninth Doctor used, the Received Pronunciation of most earlier Doctors, or Tennant's natural Scottish English. David Tennant told SFX magazine in 2006 that Russell T Davies had asked him to drop his natural Scottish accent, because he felt \"we'd like to not go for another obvious regional accent, because I suppose they'd done that\".  In a 23 December interview on BBC Radio 1, Tennant explained that a line had been scripted for the Christmas special explaining that the newly regenerated Doctor had imprinted on Rose Tyler's accent, \"like a chick hatching from an egg\", but the line was cut from the final episode.", "The Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) regenerated into the Tenth Doctor at the climax of the first series (2005) finale, \"The Parting of the Ways\"; he re-introduces himself to his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in a Children in Need mini-episode called \"Born Again\". In the 2005 Christmas special, \"The Christmas Invasion\", he is in a comatose state for most of the episode, following his regeneration. After eventually waking up, he defeats the alien Sycorax and saves Earth; in the process, he loses a hand, which regrows owing to his recent regeneration. Amongst other second series (2006) adventures, The Doctor and Rose save Queen Victoria (Pauline Collins) from a werewolf in \"Tooth and Claw\", resulting in the creation of the anti-alien Torchwood Institute. In \"School Reunion\", The Doctor shares an adventure with two former companions, journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and robot dog K9 (voiced by John Leeson), before taking on Rose's boyfriend Mickey (Noel Clarke) as a second companion. The TARDIS slips through a crack in the Time Vortex causing them to be stranded on a parallel Earth, where they encounter the Cybermen in the episode, \"Rise of the Cybermen\". After saving parallel Earth, Mickey decides to stay and help stop the Cybermen around the world despite The Doctor telling him he can never return in \"The Age of Steel\". He and Rose become stranded on a planet orbiting around a black hole in \"The Impossible Planet\" where The Beast is waiting, with a Torchwood team. While there, in \"The Satan Pit\", The Beast taunts The Doctor and Rose about Rose's death. During the 2012 Olympic Games in \"Fear Her\", The Doctor picks up the Olympic flame and carries it to the end, starting the Games. The series finale takes place in contemporary London, where modern-day Torchwood is the scene for war between the evil alien Daleks and parallel-universe cyborgs the Cybermen; saving the Earth costs The Doctor Rose, who is stranded in a parallel universe, along with Mickey and her mother, in \"Doomsday\".", "David Tennant has also made numerous cameo appearances as The Doctor outside of Doctor Who, frequently in spoof appearances. Singer and actress Charlotte Church spoofs Doctor Who alongside an actor playing the Tenth Doctor in her own The Charlotte Church Show (2006). In an appearance on The Friday Night Project in 2007, Tennant plays a female companion to the Tenth Doctor (Justin Lee Collins) on the Pink Planet, where they are confronted by the alien Gay Lord (Alan Carr). When the show became The Sunday Night Project, Catherine Tate appeared in a skit playing the Tenth Doctor. Tennant starred opposite Catherine Tate in her own The Catherine Tate Show special (2007) as Lauren Cooper's (Tate) teacher Mr. Logan, who Cooper teases for his resemblance to The Doctor; eventually, he reveals himself to be the Tenth Doctor and shrinks Cooper into a 5\" Rose Tyler action figure. In the final episode of Extras (December 2007), a brief scene shows The Doctor and an unidentified Wren companion attacked by Schlong, a slug-like alien played by Andy Millman (Ricky Gervais). The Tenth Doctor is also featured in political satire; in a 2007 episode of Dead Ringers, when faced by the question of Gordon Brown's succession, Tony Blair (impressionist Jon Culshaw) regenerates into David Tennant after promising \"New Labour is all about renewal\", later vowing 100 more years of power. Tennant modifies his first line in \"The Parting of the Ways\" (\"New teeth, that's weird\"), to \"New Labour, that's weird\" and proceeds to address the public in a Tony Blair impression resembling Culshaw's. Tennant also guest-voiced his incarnation of The Doctor in an episode of Family Guy (2016). He later played the role in full costume for a sketch with The Muppets in a live performance at The O2 Arena in 2018.", "On 26 October 2015, it was announced Tennant would reprise his role for The Tenth Doctor Adventures, a series of full-cast audio stories produced by Big Finish Productions.
