Following a trial month, in which Marcelle never really got a look in, in any of the teams friendly games, he was still offered a short-term deal and joined Ashley Sestanovich and Glen Downey as one of three players taken to Blundell Park from his former club. Grimsby was to be his first professional football club in two years. Despite being offered a contract, Marcelle found it extremely hard to break into the team and was often looked past in favour for Michael Reddy, Andy Parkinson and Darren Mansaram, and would often find it very difficult on winning a place on the substitute bench. Marcelle made his only start for the Mariners against Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, and following only four other sub appearances, Marcelle would not play again for Grimsby. Slade decided to bring in two more strikers in Martin Gritton and Colin Cramb, and that coupled with loan signings such as Jon Daly and Chris Williams, Marcelle was eventually released by Grimsby on 31 October 2004."]}, {"page": "Graham Hockless", "response": ["Russell Slade took over as the club's manager for the start of the 2004\u201305 season but rarely included Hockless, and despite confusion for his prolonged absence by the club's supporters the player was constantly looked past in favour of players such as Thomas Pinault and Ashley Sestanovich.
