She is Emeritus Professor of Linguistics at King's College, London.In 1977, Kempson published Semantic Theory, which discusses the concept of entailment in linguistics. A proposition (P) is entailed by another (Q) if P is true when Q is true and Q is false when P is false, but Q is not strictly defined if P is true. She was awarded a Fellow of the British Academy in 1989. She has made contributions to the theoretical framework of Dynamic syntax.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hyponymy and hypernymy", "response": ["A word is an autohyponym if it is used for both a hypernym and its hyponym. For example, the word dog describes both the species Canis familiaris and male individuals of Canis familiaris, so it is possible to say \"That dog isn't a dog, it's a bitch\" (\"That hypernym Z isn't a hyponym Z, it's a hyponym Y\"). The term \"autohyponym\" was coined by linguist Laurence R. Horn in a 1984 paper, Ambiguity, negation, and the London School of Parsimony. Linguist Ruth Kempson had already observed that if there are hyponyms for one part of a set but not another, the hypernym can complement the existing hyponym by being used for the remaining part. For example, fingers describe all digits on a hand, but the existence of the word thumb for the first finger means that fingers can also be used for \"non-thumb digits on a hand\". Autohyponymy is also called \"vertical polysemy\"."]}, {"page": "Allan Bell (sociolinguist)", "response": ["Bell received a PhD scholarship from the University of Auckland in 1970. Seeing as how Bell had wanted to study linguistics but lacked the sufficient background to do so, the scholarship allowed him to have the sufficient amount of funding to study abroad to do the coursework for the field. Bell ended up going to London, England and began attending and auditing courses that were being taught by well-known London linguists, including Randolph Quirk, Ruth Kempson, Neil Smith, Dick Hudson, and Bill Downs."]}, {"page": "Kempson", "response": ["*Ruth Kempson (born 1944), British linguist"]}, {"page": "Department of Philosophy, King's College London", "response": ["* Ruth Kempson, Emeritus Professor of Linguistics"]}, {"page": "Lutz Marten", "response": ["After studying English language and literature, philosophy and African studies at the University of Hamburg, Marten joined SOAS for a Masters programme in linguistics in 1993, where, in 1995, he subsequently began his doctoral studies under the supervision of Ruth Kempson.
