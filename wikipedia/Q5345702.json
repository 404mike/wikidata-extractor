He served briefly as a Senator for South Australia (1921\u20131922) and was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly (1918\u20131921, 1924\u20131930) before and after his service in federal parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Guy (Australian politician)", "response": ["Guy married Margaret McElwee in Launceston on 13 November 1884.

The party was formed by disaffected Nationalists, principally Thomas Ashworth and Charles Merrett, who opposed the leadership of Prime Minister Billy Hughes. Two federal Nationalist MPs, Victorian William Watt and South Australian Richard Foster, joined the Liberal Party and three more MPs (John Latham from Victoria, and Malcolm Cameron and Jack Duncan-Hughes from South Australia) were elected in the 1922 federal election. South Australian Nationalist Senators James Rowell and Edward Vardon also contested the election, unsuccessfully, as Liberals. Their opposition to Hughes, coupled with the hostility of the Country Party to supporting a Hughes-led government, was a factor in Hughes' decision to resign the prime ministership in favour of Stanley Bruce. After Hughes' removal, all five Liberals rejoined the Nationalist Party, although they remained officially Liberals until 1925."]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1914 Australian federal election", "response": ["| |Robert Guthrie*John Newland*James O'Loghlin*William Senior*William Story* || |Benjamin BennyPatrick DaleyGeorge JenkinsJohn Shannon*George StewartEdward Vardon"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1922 Australian federal election", "response": ["*On 16 February 1921, Edward Vardon (Nationalist) was appointed as a South Australian Senator to succeed Robert Guthrie (Nationalist).", "*In 1922, Nationalists disaffected with Prime Minister Billy Hughes's leadership formed the Liberal Party.
