Mary Clare Moore headed the first wave and placed herself and her Sisters under the authority of Nightingale. The two were to remain friends for the rest of their lives. The second wave, headed by Mary Francis Bridgeman met with a cooler reception as Bridgeman refused to give up her authority over her Sisters to Nightingale while at the same time not trusting Nightingale, whom she regarded as ambitious.Bridgeman, M.

Later in life, she kept up a prolonged correspondence with Irish nun Sister Mary Clare Moore, with whom she had worked in Crimea. Her most beloved confidante was Mary Clarke, an Englishwoman she met in Paris in 1837 and kept in touch with throughout her life.Cannadine, David. \"Ever Yours, Florence Nightingale: Selected Letters.\" The New Republic. 203.7 (13 August 1990): 38\u201342."]}, {"page": "Sisters of Mercy", "response": ["The Sisters offered free schools for the poor, academies for the daughters of the rising middle class, and \u201chouses of mercy\u201d, providing shelter for poor youth and women in Dublin and other cities who were in danger of being exploited.

The group arrived in Constantinople on 17 December 1854, with Doyle later being sent to the general hospital at Scutari, working alongside her fellow nuns such as Mary Clare Moore and Mary Francis Bridgeman. In Scutari she treated soldiers suffering from typhus, cholera, dysentery, as well as gangrene and frostbite. She later recalled that \"Their moans would pierce the heart.\" From October 1855 to April 1856 she served at the general hospital in Balaklava. Doyle and her fellow nuns were the subject of intense scrutiny and despite their denials, the war office warned them not to proselytise."]}, {"page": "Mary Francis Bridgeman", "response": ["The Crimean War of 1854-56 saw many more soldiers dying from disease and lack of care rather than from wounds obtained in battle. The War Office faced a demand from the British public for experienced nurses to immediately be sent to the Crimea and it turned to Ireland for nurses with the Sisters of Mercy immediately offering their services.Bolster Evelyn. (Sr. Mary Angela Bolster, R.S.M). 1964. The Sisters of Mercy in the Crimean War. Cork: The Mercier Press. [Google Scholar] The Sisters wrote to the War Office on 18 October 1854 stating, 'Attendance on the sick is, as you are aware, part of our Institute; and sad experience among the poor has convinced us that, even with the advantage of medical attendance, many valuable lives are lost for want of careful nursing.' Their offer was accepted and Bridgeman and a party of 11 or 12 Sisters departed from London on 2 December 1854, travelling via Paris and Marseilles, where they boarded a ship for Constantinople in a second wave of Irish nurses after Mary Clare Moore with the intention of assisting Florence Nightingale at Scutari Hospital.Mary Raphael Paradis, Edith Mary Hart and Mary Judith O\u2019Brien, 'The Sisters of Mercy in the Crimean War: Lessons for Catholic health care' - The Linacre Quarterly (2017) 84(1): 29\u201343. Published online ", "In October 1855 Dr. John Hall, Inspector-General of Hospitals in the Crimea, in a direct snub to Florence Nightingale by not consulting or informing her, appointed Bridgeman as Superintendent of the Balaclava General Hospital. This only succeeded in exacerbating the tension which already existed between Nightingale and BridgemanSisters of Mercy - Brought to Life: Exploring the History of Medicine - Science Museum, London which persisted throughout the rest of the military campaign,Mary C. Sullivan (ed), The Friendship of Florence Nightingale and Mary Clare Moore, University of Pennsylvania Press (1999) - Google Books pg. 56 with peace being brokered by various hospital doctors and chaplains resulting in the Sisters being permitted to continue with their nursing. In several letters Nightingale referred to Bridgeman as 'Mrs. Bridgeman' and 'Reverend Mother Brickbat'.John W. Donohue, 'Sisters in Mercy' - America: the Jesuit Review, - 4 June 2001 ", "However, tensions also existed between Bridgeman and Mother Mary Clare Moore, who had arrived in the first wave of Irish Sisters of Mercy in October 1854. Each of the two had their own agenda, with Moore being anxious to avoid being accused of attempting to convert wounded Protestant soldiers to Catholicism; while Bridgeman could not understand how Moore could allow herself to be under the authority of Nightingale, a secular woman. Bridgeman believed that Nightingale had deliberately driven a wedge between the two groups of Sisters. She did not like or trust Nightingale and was careful to gain the support of Dr. John Hall, who also disliked Nightingale. As war in the Crimea was coming to an end Nightingale visited Bridgeman and her Sisters at the Crimean hospitals at the frontline to invite them join her at Scutari, but they declined to go. In the Crimea the Sisters introduced tried and tested systems of management and nursing details of which were requested by Nightingale. Mother Mary Francis's journal relates that 'Miss N took notes on our manner of nursing which I explained to her as she hoped someone might profit of it'. It has been suggested that the system of management and nursing introduced by Bridgeman and her Sisters in the Crimea found their way uncredited into Nightingale's report to the War Office.Bridgeman, p. 367 "]}]}}
