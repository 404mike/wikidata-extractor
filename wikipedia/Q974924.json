Along with Errol Flynn, Newton was one of the more popular actors among the male juvenile audience of the 1940s and early 1950s, especially with British boys. Known for his hard-living lifestyle, he was cited as a role model by the actor Oliver Reed and the Who's drummer Keith Moon.Newton is best remembered for his portrayal of the feverish-eyed Long John Silver in the 1950 film adaptation of Treasure Island, the film that became the standard for screen portrayals of historical pirates. He continued to portray pirates in Blackbeard in 1952 and Long John Silver again in the 1954 film of the same title, which spawned a miniseries in the mid-1950s. Born in Dorset in the West Country of England and growing up in Cornwall near Lands End, his exaggeration of his West Country accent is credited with popularising the stereotypical \"pirate voice\". Newton has become the \"patron saint\" of the annual International Talk Like a Pirate Day.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 1", "response": ["*1905 \u2013 Robert Newton, English-American actor (d. 1956)"]}, {"page": "Lamorna", "response": ["The actor Robert Newton (1905\u20131956) was educated in Lamorna and his ashes were scattered in the sea off Lamorna by his son, Nicholas Newton."]}, {"page": "March 25", "response": ["*  1956   \u2013 Robert Newton, English actor (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "1905", "response": ["* June 1 \u2013 Robert Newton, English actor (d. 1956)"]}, {"page": "1956", "response": ["** Robert Newton, English film actor (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "Bristol", "response": ["The Watershed Media Centre and Arnolfini gallery (both in dockside warehouses) exhibit contemporary art, photography and cinema, and the city's oldest gallery is at the Royal West of England Academy in Clifton.

He took Apu's voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area, and also loosely based it on Peter Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film The Party. Originally, it was thought that Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotyped, but after Azaria's reading of the line \"Hello, Mr. Homer\", which the show's producers thought was hilarious, the character stayed. Azaria, however, disputed this on LateNet with Ray Ellin, claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical. Chief Wiggum's voice was originally a parody of David Brinkley, but when Azaria was told it was too slow, he switched it to that of Edward G. Robinson. Officer Lou is based on Sylvester Stallone, and Dr. Nick is \"a bad Ricky Ricardo impression.\" The \"Wise Guy\" voice is \"basically Charles Bronson,\" while Carl is \"a silly voice [Azaria] always did.\" Two of the voices come from his time at college: Snake's is based on Azaria's old college roommate, while Comic Book Guy's voice is based on a student who lived in the room next door to Azaria and went by the name \"F\". Professor Frink is based on Jerry Lewis' performance in the original The Nutty Professor, and the Sea Captain is based on English actor Robert Newton's portrayal of many pirates. Azaria based his performance for the one-time character Frank Grimes, from the episode \"Homer's Enemy\", on actor William H. Macy. He counts Grimes as the hardest, most emotional performance he has ever had to give in the history of The Simpsons."]}, {"page": "Glynis Johns", "response": ["She did another for Annakin, The Seekers (1954) with Jack Hawkins, then co-starred with Robert Newton in The Beachcomber (1954).
