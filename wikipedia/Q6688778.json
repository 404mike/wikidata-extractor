This proves evident at the times where the character inflicts his behaviour onto Rita's several friends and neighbors alike. During the course of his story arc, Alan has an affair with local barmaid Gloria Todd (Sue Jenkins); beats up her troublesome customer, Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro), at The Rovers Return Inn public house for badmouthing him; repeatedly clashes with the pub's landlady Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear); sparks a feud with Jenny's boyfriend Martin Platt (Sean Wilson); threatens to hurt Rita's business partner Mavis Riley (Thelma Barlow) and her husband Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) for intruding on his plan to make changes at Rita's shop called \"The Kabin\"; planned to buy the Weatherfield garage from its departing manager, Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten), until the latter decided to stay in the street with his wife Gail (Helen Worth) and cancelled the sale before Alan could bid for the new ownership; harbored unrequited romantic feelings for his client Carole Burns (Irene Skillington); dismissed Jenny's engagement to her fianc\u00e9 Patrice Podevin (Franck Dubosc) after she ran away to France to stop her father controlling every aspect of her life; tried unsuccessfully to go into partnership with his boss Dave Craig (Alan Hulse) upon creating his own business, initially dubbed \"Bradley Securities Limited\" and later renamed \"Weatherfield Security Systems\"; and attempted to rape his receptionist Dawn Prescott (Louise Harrison) after she rebuffed his efforts to spark a romance between them.", "Alan did everything to keep the truth from Rita, whilst also trying to retain his \"family-man\" relationships with both her and Jenny in the process. He had all letters from the bank re-directed to the shop and handled all mail and phone calls himself. The business grew more successful when Alan employed Martin to be his assistant, partly at Jenny's urging, and later hired the newly arrived Dawn Prescott (Louise Harrison) to become his receptionist. Alan quickly fancied Dawn and asked her out, telling her Rita was just his landlady, but she wasn't interested."]}, {"page": "List of The Bill characters", "response": ["| Donna Harris || Louise Harrison || 1991-1996 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|178 || P.C."]}, {"page": "Louise (given name)", "response": ["*Louise Harrison, British actress"]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Dawn Prescott || Louise Harrison || 1989"]}, {"page": "1962 in British television", "response": ["*26 November \u2013 Louise Harrison, actress and producer"]}]}}
