After two seasons on Tayside, he joined hometown club Hamilton Academical (where his father Alex had once been club chairman) and became established as a highly talented player.\nGibson moved to English football with Bolton Wanderers in March 1927. Two years later, he was in the Trotters team which won the FA Cup, scoring in the semi-final win over Huddersfield Town at Anfield before playing his part in beating Portsmouth in the final at Wembley. With six years and 236 Football League First Division appearances for Bolton behind him, a strong performance and goal against Chelsea in February 1933 prompted the London club to sign him a few weeks later, and he spent the last five seasons of his professional career at Stamford Bridge before retiring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Gibson", "response": ["George Gibson may refer to:", "* George Gibson (baseball) (1880\u20131967), Canadian baseball player", "* George Gibson (American football) (1905\u20132004), American football player", "* George Gibson (Tasmania cricketer) (1827\u20131873), Australian cricketer", "* George Gibson (Victoria cricketer) (1827\u20131910), Australian cricketer", "* George Gibson (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u20131977), Scottish footballer (Hamilton, Bolton, Chelsea)", "* George Gibson (footballer, born 1912) (1912\u20131990), English footballer", "* George Gibson (footballer, born 1945), Scottish footballer", "* George Gibson (footballer, born 2000), Norwegian footballer", "* George Gibson (Australian footballer) (1885\u20131933), Australian footballer for Essendon and Richmond", "* George Gibson, Lewis and Clark Expedition member", "* George Gibson (1775-1861), United States Army's first Commissary General of Subsistence.", "* George Gibson (trade unionist) (1885\u20131953), British trade unionist and director of the Bank of England", "* George Gibson Coote (1880\u20131959), Canadian politician", "* George Gibson (mathematician) (1858\u20131930), Scottish mathematician and academic author"]}, {"page": "1929 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||10|| George Gibson"]}, {"page": "List of Hamilton Academical F.C. players", "response": ["|George Gibson||||1925\u20131927||73||16||"]}]}}
