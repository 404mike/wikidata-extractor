After two seasons on Tayside, he joined hometown club Hamilton Academical (where his father Alex had once been club chairman) and became established as a highly talented player.\nGibson moved to English football with Bolton Wanderers in March 1927. Two years later, he was in the Trotters team which won the FA Cup, scoring in the semi-final win over Huddersfield Town at Anfield before playing his part in beating Portsmouth in the final at Wembley. With six years and 236 Football League First Division appearances for Bolton behind him, a strong performance and goal against Chelsea in February 1933 prompted the London club to sign him a few weeks later, and he spent the last five seasons of his professional career at Stamford Bridge before retiring.", "link_mentions": {}}}
