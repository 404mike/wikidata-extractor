The band's current lineup consists of Gillespie, Andrew Innes (guitar), Martin Duffy (keyboards), Simone Butler (bass), and Darrin Mooney (drums). Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert \"Throb\" Young.", "The band, now consisting of Gillespie, Innes and Young, relocated to Brighton to regroup. Young switched to guitar, and they recruited bassist Henry Olsen and drummer Phillip \"Toby\" Tomanov, who had both been in Nico's backing band, The Faction. They traded in their jangle pop sound for a harder rock edge, or as Gillespie said, \"[w]e had found rock 'n' roll.\" The band re-signed to Creation Records and released their first single in two years, \"Ivy, Ivy, Ivy\". This was followed by a full album, Primal Scream. The band's new sound was met with poor reviews, NME called it \"confused and lacking in cohesion\". Fans responded as unfavourably as the critics, with many of the old fans being disappointed or simply confused by the new sound. The album featured Felt keyboardist Martin Duffy guesting.", "The band entered the studio with Weatherall, Hugo Nicolson, The Orb and Jimmy Miller producing, and Martin Duffy now full-time on keyboards. They released two more singles, \"Higher Than The Sun\" and \"Don't Fight It, Feel It\" which featured the lead vocals of Manchester singer Denise Johnson. The album, Screamadelica, was released in late 1991 to positive reviews. Ink Blot Magazine said that the album was \"both of its time and timeless.\"   The album was also a commercial success, reaching number eight on the UK chart. The album won the first Mercury Music Prize, beating Gillespie's former band The Jesus and Mary Chain.", "*Martin Duffy \u2013 keyboards, synths, turntables (1989\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "The Charlatans (English band)", "response": ["Keyboard player Rob Collins was killed in a traffic accident on 22 July 1996, during the recording of the band's fifth album Tellin' Stories.
