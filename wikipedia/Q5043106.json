Days later the incident spilled over into an England training session, resulting in lengthy bans for twins Carly and Gemma Hunt, as well as Walker and her Charlton teammate Eartha Pond."]}, {"page": "2002 FA Women's Cup Final", "response": ["As Doncaster Belles were an FA Women's Premier League National Division club, they entered the competition in the fourth round; one round later than Fulham. Doncaster Belles' cup run started with a rescheduled trip to the Withdean Stadium to face Brighton & Hove Albion. Despite Brighton taking the lead after only 10\u00a0minutes, Doncaster Belles mastered the wet and windy conditions and hit back strongly to win 5\u20132. In another delayed fixture in the fifth round, Doncaster Belles travelled to Wales to meet Barry Town. The match at Jenner Park was again played in wind and heavy rain. A goal from Jody Handley and a strong midfield performance from debutant Carly Hunt earned a 1\u20130 win and a quarter final meeting with Arsenal.", "The subsequent 2\u20131 win over Cup holders Arsenal at Brodsworth Welfare Ground surprised many, who had predicted a repeat of the previous year's Arsenal\u2013Fulham final. Doncaster Belles had gone two goals ahead within the first half hour through Handley and Karen Burke. Although Marieanne Spacey replied for Arsenal, a resilient second half display saw Doncaster Belles end a run of six successive defeats\u2014stretching back almost two years\u2014against their old rivals. The BBC reported that the final whistle was \"joyously celebrated\" by the Doncaster Belles players. In the semi-final against Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park, defeat appeared likely when Tranmere went ahead through a 28th\u2013minute penalty and Burke missed a penalty for Doncaster Belles. But Carly Hunt scored an equalising goal from close range, then Tranmere were reduced to ten players when Faye Dunn was shown the red card. England captain Karen Walker secured a 3\u20131 win and Doncaster Belles' place in the final with two late goals.", "In what the Daily Telegraph called a \"breakneck speed\" start to the match, Leanne Hall saved a low 20\u00a0yard (18m) shot from Rachel McArthur and Moore later kicked over the bar from close range. At the other end of the pitch, early chances included Walker failing to control Exley's through ball, Michelle Barr shooting narrowly over and Astrid Johannessen parrying Carly Hunt's effort. As the match wore on Pettersen was largely subdued by the close attentions of Lowe. Reports in The Guardian, The Independent and the BBC indicate that the physical and direct approach of the Doncaster Belles stifled Fulham's passing game, keeping scoring opportunities at both ends to a minimum.", "Although the teams remained level at the break, Fulham went ahead ten\u00a0minutes into the second half. Carly Hunt was cautioned for a foul at the edge of the penalty area, then Yankey curled the resultant free kick low around a poorly placed defensive wall and past unsighted Belles goalkeeper Hall. On the hour, with Doncaster Belles still recovering, Chapman volleyed in a second goal for Fulham from 20\u00a0yards (18m). Seconds later Burke supplied an accurate cross for Handley to head a reply for Doncaster Belles.", "|LB |||| Carly Hunt || "]}, {"page": "1997 FA Women's Cup Final", "response": ["Only Julie Fletcher, at 16 the youngest member of the 1991 squad, and Lou Waller, employed by parent\u2013club Millwall as a community officer, remained with the team. In Waller's words: \"We had to shunt all the teams up. The reserves became the seniors, the juniors became the reserves.\" By 1997 Millwall Lionesses' emphasis on youth development had produced international calibre players such as Mary Phillip, Katie Chapman, Danielle Murphy and Carly Hunt. England's first\u2013choice goalkeeper Pauline Cope had also returned to the club from Arsenal. In March 1997 Millwall Lionesses defeated Everton in the final of the FA Women's Premier League Cup."]}]}}
