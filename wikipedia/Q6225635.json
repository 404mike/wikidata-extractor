He played football for Corinthian F.C., and was selected to play for Wales four times between 1887 and 1890. As a cricketer, he made over 50 first-class appearances, all for Somerset County Cricket Club. His availability in both sports was limited by his career in education; he was headmaster at a number of schools across southern England.\nChallen was considered one of Somerset's principle amateur batsmen during the late 1880s and early 1890s, when he frequently finished near the top of their batting averages. His style was more defensive than many of his fellow amateurs, and he was often praised for playing vital innings to keep Somerset's batting together. He scored the only first-class century of his career in 1893 against Sussex, but began to appear less often after 1894, finally bowing out of county cricket after the 1899 season. In all, he scored 1,656 first-class runs at an average of 19.71.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Challen (1884\u20131899) 52 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1890", "response": ["| John Challen || style=\"text-align:center\"| ||  || Right-handed || Right arm fast-medium ||"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1891", "response": ["| John Challen ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm fast-medium"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | John Challen", "The county had just four days to rest and recover from their loss before facing Surrey at The Oval. Bastard was again unavailable for Somerset, and after losing the toss once more, Somerset spent the whole of the first day in the field. Surrey accumulated 564 runs during that day, and reached 635 before Somerset claimed the tenth wicket to close the innings. At that stage, Maurice Read remained at the crease, having scored 186 not out, his highest score in first-class cricket. The Somerset opening bowlers, Winter and Parfitt, had both conceded in excess of 100 runs for the second match in a row. Sainsbury had utilised one less bowler than against Gloucestershire in his search for wickets, and claimed four of the wickets himself, recording a career-best four for 74. Hewett, whom he asked to bowl 30\u00a0overs, finished with 11 maiden overs. The 30 overs he bowled in the match accounted for over a quarter of all his bowling in first-class cricket. In reply to Surrey's total, Somerset were bowled out for 83 in their first innings, in which only John Challen and Crescens Robinson reached double figures, scoring 29 and 12 respectively. Clapp is recorded as \"absent hurt\" in both of Somerset's innings. In the second innings, Somerset were much improved, reaching 251, their highest batting total of the season. Radcliffe scored the county's only century of the season, scoring 101, and he shared a partnership of 129 with Hewett for the fourth wicket. Hewett reached his own highest score of the season, totalling 85. Nevertheless, Somerset's loss was even heavier than that suffered a week earlier, losing by an innings and 301 runs. As of March 2011, both of these back-to-back losses remain among the ten heaviest experienced by the county in first-class cricket.", "Surrey visited the County Ground, Taunton a few days later for the counties' second meeting of the season. In a repeat of their previous fixtures, Surrey won the toss and chose to bat. Bastard, who had not played in their earlier clash, opened the bowling for Somerset alongside John Challen. Bastard, presumably due to the weakness of the rest of the county's attack, bowled 50 overs, but he could not repeat the successes he had achieved against Hampshire, toiling to take two for 99. All of Somerset's six bowlers in that innings claimed a wicket as Surrey were bowled out for 292. In reply, Radcliffe occupied the crease as the batsmen at the other end came and went, scoring exactly half of Somerset's 164. Roe, Sainsbury and Hewett all reached double figures, but four Somerset batsmen were dismissed for ducks. Requested to follow on, Somerset fared less well in their second innings: Roe reached 43, but no other batsman passed 20, and Somerset were all out for 123, five runs short of forcing Surrey to bat again."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1884", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | John Challen"]}, {"page": "Edward Stanley (cricketer)", "response": ["In late August 1884, Somerset County Cricket Club had just lost to Kent to record their fourth loss in five matches during 1884.

They were due to be met in Manchester by three members of the Somerset team that had not been able to make it to Kent; John Challen, Bill Roe and Herbert Fowler.

In the contemporary report of the first day's play in the match in The Times newspaper, the day finished with Kent's first innings completed and Somerset at 30 for three wickets, and among the Somerset players yet to bat was John Challen. In the report of the second day's play in the following day's newspaper, when Somerset's first innings had been completed, Challen is not in the team and \"Mr H. E. Winter\" is the No 11 batsman, having made an unbeaten 24. Winter made 0 in the second innings and also bowled a single (four-ball) over which went for nine runs.
