The orders of the ACCA are also derived from the Old Catholic movement, in this case by way of Arnold Mathew.  The ACCA, however, is not in communion with any of the Oriental Orthodox Churches. It ordains women to the diaconate and does not require celibacy of its bishops, allowing them, like priests and deacons, to marry.   The ACCA states that its approach to theology and practice is a process of \"critical reappropriation\" which is open to influences from all sectors of trinitarian Christianity but is, at the same time, rooted in the Syriac Christian tradition, particularly with regard to such foundational matters as Christology (miaphysitism), soteriology, ecclesiology, and Christian ethics."]}, {"page": "Arnold Harris Mathew", "response": ["#redirect Arnold Mathew"]}, {"page": "Arnold Harris Matthew", "response": ["#redirect Arnold Mathew"]}, {"page": "Ren\u00e9 Vilatte", "response": ["The Church of England (CoE) found Marsh-Edwards to be \"incapable of holding preferment\" after he was required to \"answer charges against his moral character.\" Although Marsh-Edwards was married, Vilatte consecrated him as a bishop.

A glimmer of hope appeared when in a move calculated to snub the Polish Catholic authorities, the Russian government recognized the Mariavite movement as a \"tolerated sect\" in November 1906. Then, through the good offices of Russian General Alexander Kireyev, the leadership was permitted to contact the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands. Successful discussions between the two bodies led in 1909 to the invitation of a Mariavite delegation led by Kowalski, to attend a congress in Utrecht. There he was consecrated as the first Mariavite bishop, by the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands Archbishop, Gerardus Gul, assisted by bishops, Jakob van Thiel of Haarlem, Nicholas Spit of Deventer, Josef Demmel of Bonn and Arnold Mathew from London. The Apostolic succession of that church validated his elevation and thereby turned the movement into a new church, which the Russian authorities consented to recognise as an \"independent denomination\" in 1912. As the ailing Koz\u0142owska's influence waned so the forceful Kowalski had free rein to mould the new church to his liking. One controversial innovation was that from 1906, the church celebrated the liturgy in the Polish vernacular, rather than in Latin. In 1919, the Mariavites officially changed their name to the Old Catholic Church of the Mariavites."]}, {"page": "Matthew Arnold (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Arnold Mathew (1852\u20131919), first Old Catholic bishop in the UK"]}, {"page": "Bulls, etc., from Rome Act 1571", "response": ["In 1911, Pope Pius X excommunicated Arnold Mathew from the Catholic Church.
