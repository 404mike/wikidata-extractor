The term \"post-dubstep\" has been used synonymously to refer to artists, such as Blake, Mount Kimbie and Fantastic Mr. Fox whose work drew on UK garage, 2-step, and other forms of underground dance music, as well as ambient music and early R&B.

Judy Collins's 1967 recording of \"Both Sides, Now\" reached No. 8 on Billboard charts and was a breakthrough in the career of both artists. (Mitchell's own recording did not see release until two years later, on her second album Clouds.) This is Mitchell's most-covered song by far, with over 1,200 versions recorded at latest count. Hole also covered \"Both Sides, Now\" in 1991 on their debut album, Pretty on the Inside, retitling it \"Clouds\", with the lyrics altered by frontwoman Courtney Love. Pop group Neighborhood in 1970 and Amy Grant in 1995 scored hits with covers of \"Big Yellow Taxi\", the third-most covered song in Mitchell's repertoire (with over 300 covers). Recent releases of this song have been by Counting Crows in 2002 and Nena in 2007. Janet Jackson used a sample of the chorus of \"Big Yellow Taxi\" as the centerpiece of her 1997 hit single \"Got 'Til It's Gone\", which also features rapper Q-Tip saying \"Joni Mitchell never lies\". \"River\", from Mitchell's album Blue became the second-most covered song of Mitchell's in 2013 as many artists chose it for their holiday albums. Rap artists Kanye West and Mac Dre have also sampled Mitchell's vocals in their music. In addition, Annie Lennox has covered \"Ladies of the Canyon\" for the B-side of her 1995 hit \"No More I Love You's\". Mandy Moore covered \"Help Me\" in 2003. In 2004 singer George Michael covered her song \"Edith and the Kingpin\" for a radio show. \"River\" has been one of the most popular songs covered in recent years, with versions by Dianne Reeves (1999), James Taylor (recorded for television in 2000, and for CD release in 2004), Allison Crowe (2004), Rachael Yamagata (2004), Aimee Mann (2005), and Sarah McLachlan (2006). McLachlan also did a version of \"Blue\" in 1996, and Cat Power recorded a cover of \"Blue\" in 2008. Other Mitchell covers include the famous \"Woodstock\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Eva Cassidy, and Matthews Southern Comfort; \"This Flight Tonight\" by Nazareth; and well-known versions of \"A Case of You\" by Tori Amos, Michelle Branch, Jane Monheit, Prince, Diana Krall, James Blake, and Ana Moura. A 40th anniversary version of \"Woodstock\" was released in 2009 by Nick Vernier Band featuring Ian Matthews (formerly of Matthews Southern Comfort).
