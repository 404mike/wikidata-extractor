His membership in the later illegal organisation (the IWW - or 'Wobblies') brought about imprisonment and conviction in Perth, when he participated in the campaign opposing conscription. Tried along with a group of other men, his advanced age of over 80 made him perhaps one of the oldest to have been convicted on this charge. Many of his friends and colleagues were to assist in his defence, including Annie Westbrook and Willem Siebenhaar (sacked and consequently charged), and this high-profile case was to have a significant impact on the socialist and union movements and to the conscription debate. Miller was released after serving a few weeks of his sentence as the Judge had offered Miller, and another defendant, Sawtell, two years imprisonment or to be bound over for the same period to 'be of good behaviour and to keep the peace.' Miller was re-arrested in 1917 in Sydney at the age of 84 and sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour at Long Bay Gaol on the charge of belonging to an unlawful association.Joe Toscano, Australian Anarchist History - Monty Miller, Anarchist Age Weekly Review Number 215 2 September 1996 His Sydney arrest was apparently because he broke his bond."]}, {"page": "The Abrolhos tragedy", "response": ["The translation came about after Florance Broadhurst, who was managing a guano mining operation in the Houtman Abrolhos, acquired a first edition of , and commissioned Willem Siebenhaar to translate it.

He developed an interest in the wreck, and eventually obtained a copy of Isaac Commelin's 1647 , the Dutch publication that first popularised the Batavia incident. He commissioned Willem Siebenhaar to translate it, and this resulted in what is still the only English translation, entitled The Abrolhos tragedy. Broadhurst maintained a catalogue of his finds, which he donated to the state. These were eventually shown to be related not to the Batavia, but  the VOC ship Zeewijk, which was wrecked off Gun Island in 1727. A friend of his children, Henrietta Drake-Brockman, came to learn of the Dutch wrecks while around the family home, and she became an acknowledged force in the eventual location of the Batavia wreck and its survivor's campsite. Though a great success, in 1904 Broadhurst lost the monopoly to the guano industry."]}, {"page": "Siebenhaar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Willem Siebenhaar "]}]}}
