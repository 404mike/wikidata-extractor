In the 1960s he was a key player in the London Scottish rugby sevens team, winning the Middlesex Sevens tournament five times from 1960 to 1965.  He started to scale back his rugby-playing activities in 1965 and finally his amateur rugby career was ended by a ban for working as a freelance journalist on a British Lions tour in 1966, writing for The Observer and The Scotsman, which led to a ruling by the International Rugby Board that he had become a professional.
