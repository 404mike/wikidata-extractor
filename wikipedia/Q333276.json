Geoffrey Howe, Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer and Foreign Secretary under Mrs Thatcher, who became head of pro-euro group Britain in Europe during the election campaign, did not endorse the PECP but said the resignations from the Conservatives \"should send a clear and sombre signal to our party leadership\".

Asda, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Tesco, Unilever and United Biscuits are some of 73 businesses who have agreed to do so. Lansley and his special Adviser Bill Morgan formerly worked for firms with interests in the food industry and some journalists have alleged that this results in a conflict of interest. Many health professionals are not happy with the voluntary nature of the deal.  Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, felt that justifying intake on the basis of average figures was unsuitable since some members of the community could considerably exceed this."]}]}}
