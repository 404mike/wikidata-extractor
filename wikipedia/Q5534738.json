The fire started 40\u00a0minutes into the club's final game of the 1984\u201385 season against Lincoln City and destroyed the main stand in just nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the 1986\u201387 season, Bradford City played home games at Leeds United's Elland Road, Huddersfield Town's Leeds Road and Bradford Northern's Odsal Stadium, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the \u00a32.6\u00a0million work, which included funding from insurance pay-outs, Football League stadium grants, club funds and a \u00a31.46\u00a0million Government loan obtained by two Bradford MPs, Geoffrey Lawler and Max Madden. A new 5,000 all-seater main stand was built, longer than the structure which had burned down. The Kop was also covered for the first time and increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground's other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582\u00a0days after the fire, The Hon Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI.
