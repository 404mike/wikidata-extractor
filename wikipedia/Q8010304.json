Born in Manchester, he played as a goalkeeper for Newton Heath LYR. He made his debut in an FA Cup second qualifying round match against Bootle on 25 October 1890; the first team had agreed to play in a friendly against Darwen the same day, so both sides agreed to use their reserve teams. Later in the season, he made another first-team appearance in the third round of the Manchester Senior Cup, a 2\u20132 draw at home to Hurst on 14 February 1891.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gyves, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Gyves"]}]}}
