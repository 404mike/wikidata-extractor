Hattie lets her own school work suffer to help her less academic brother. Hattie's hard work at school pays off and she receives excellent grades in her final year exams, so it angers her parents when, at 16, she announces that she is leaving school to work as a waitress for Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) at his catering company, The Meal Machine. She soon becomes his personal assistant.", "As a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters.

The casting of the Tavernier family has been described as difficult by producer Corinne Hollingworth. In 1991, she commented, \"The most difficult job we've had was finding six black actors who fitted the bill for the Tavernier family. Here we needed two teenagers [Hattie and Lloyd] who looked around fifteen, but were actually older, had left school and had matures attitudes to work. They had to love music, hanging around in tracksuits and, most importantly, they had to look as if they could be twins.\" At the time Gayle commented that she loved playing younger parts, and found having Garey Bridges as her younger brother a great bonus: \"It turns out that he and I know the same crowd of people in North London so we are often out together at night.\""]}, {"page": "Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)", "response": ["As a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters.
