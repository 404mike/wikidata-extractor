Performances followed as far afield as Paris, and New York and Middleton is reputed to have made eighty thousand pounds from the play. The plot is derived from the Biblical story in Genesis 39 in which Joseph rejects attempts by his master's wife to seduce him, and she retaliates by accusing him of attempted rape. However, unlike the original, Middleton's play ends in court with the exoneration of the virtuous chauffeur and with Lady Aylesbrough exposed as a shameful perjurer. The play opened at the Globe Theatre in London in August 1927 with Jeanne de Casalis as Lady Aylesbrough and Paul Cavanagh as the accused chauffeur, and one scene caused something of a stir when she appeared on stage in pyjamas.
