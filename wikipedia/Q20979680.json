Dick Molyneux became the first official manager in the club's history and arrived at York Road having served as manager at Everton for 12 years, with a CV boasting one Football League First Division championship and two FA Cup runners-up medals. One of the first major changes Molyneux enacted was to request that the board raise funds to pay adequate summer wages for the playing squad, which would put an end to the failures of previous seasons, when the board waited until almost before the beginning of the season to transfer players in, so as to cut down on off-season wages. Due to the majority of clubs conducting their transfer business shortly after the end of the season, the tactic meant that Brentford were always short on transfer options, when conducting business close to the beginning of the following season. The board raised \u00a3330 in donations (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) and Molyneux set about building a 16-man all-professional squad which could compete in the Southern League First Division. Of the previous season's squad, only goalkeeper Tommy Spicer, inside left Percy Turner and outside left Tosher Underwood were retained and by early June 1903, Molyneux had signed an almost entirely new XI. Brentford's colours were changed for the first time since the mid-1890s, with the old claret and blue replaced by a kit consisting of gold shirts with blue stripes, white shorts and black socks.", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Percy Turner"]}]}}
