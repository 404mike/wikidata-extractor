Through this, he met Murray Beetson (of ESP Promotions and promoter of the Dreamscape raves) and became a resident at raves including Equinox Milwaukees, Dreamscape and Helter Skelter.\nHis style is a mix of euphoric hardcore with uplifting vocals. He has worked alongside many other hardcore artists including DNA, Gammer and Hixxy, though in recent years, most of his work has been with Gammer. Several years ago, he \u2013 along with Hixxy \u2013 created the successful label Essential Platinum, which has had many releases. An extensive amount of his work has been featured in the Bonkers CD series, who he has consistently mixed for.\nThe Bonkers 3 compilation, CD3 of which Dougal mixed, went gold in the UK and a special edition of the compilation was released to commemorate it. Five of the Bonkers compilations that have his contribution have gone top 20 on the UK compilations chart.DJ Dougal performed on the Dance Nation UK Live Tour in April 2009 along with artists such as Basshunter, Sash! and September.\nHe has also appeared on the Dancemania series, including its Speed sub-series such as its first issue where he appeared with three tracks.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Happy hardcore", "response": ["The breakbeat hardcore rave scene was beginning to fragment by late 1992 into a number of subsequent breakbeat-based genres: darkcore (tracks embracing dark-themed samples and stabs), hardcore jungle (reggae basslines and influences became prominent), and 4-beat also known as happy hardcore where piano rolls and uplifting vocals were still central to the sound.
