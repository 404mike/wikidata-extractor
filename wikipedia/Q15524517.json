TeleWest was headed by local independent programme producer Mallory Maltby and included BBC News personality Angela Rippon and several ex-TSW personnel in its line-up, but had failed on quality grounds unlike Westcountry.  Westcountry, meanwhile, was chaired by merchant banker Stephen Redfarn, who was a former associate of James Gatward (one of the founders of neighbouring TVS), received the support of such figures as John Banham (the then-director of Confederation of British Industry), Frank Copplestone (the former managing director of TVS's predecessor Southern Television) and John Prescott-Thomas (a television executive at BBC South West), and had financial backing from Associated Newspapers, Brittany Ferries and South West Water, which TSW had assumed would have helped Westcountry to \"certainly bid to their maximum capacity\", a bid a \"worried\" TSW itself had estimated would have been \u00a312 million a year rather than the less-than-\u00a38 million Westcountry ended up bidding."]}, {"page": "Confederation of British Industry", "response": ["* Sir John Banham (26 March 1987 \u2013 26 June 1992)"]}, {"page": "Audit Commission (United Kingdom)", "response": ["Previous incumbents include Eugene Sullivan, Steve Bundred (later of Monitor), Sir John Banham (later of the CBI), Sir Howard Davies (later of the CBI), Bank of England, FSA (Financial Services Authority) and LSE (London School of Economics), and Sir Andrew Foster."]}, {"page": "Roger Graef", "response": ["In 1973 Graef became a member of the board of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, and founded and chaired its Architectural Forum.

The Commission could be ordered by the Secretary of State to undertake \"structural reviews\" in specified areas and recommend the creation of unitary authorities in the two-tier shire counties of England.

The process was originally supposed to take some years, with the shire counties being considered in five waves, or \"tranches\", and it was hoped that the reforms would come into effect from 1994 to 1998. The process took longer than expected, with the Commission unable to recruit enough staff until November 1992. The first tranche, covering Avon, Cleveland, Derbyshire, County Durham, Gloucestershire, the Isle of Wight, Humberside, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and Somerset was nearly done by the end of 1993.
