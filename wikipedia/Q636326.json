Henry Sweet incorrectly predicted in 1877 that within a century American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible (A Handbook of Phonetics).

From 1905 to 1906, he studied in Paris under Paul Passy, who was one of the founders of the International Phonetic Association, and in 1911, he married Passy's niece Cyrille Motte. He briefly took private lessons from the British phonetician Henry Sweet.", "The problem of the phonetic description of vowels is of long standing, going back to the era of the ancient Indian linguists. Three nineteenth-century British phoneticians worked on this topic. Alexander Melville Bell (1867) devised an ingenious iconic phonetic alphabet which included an elaborate system for vowels. Alexander Ellis had also suggested vowel symbols for his phonetic alphabets. Henry Sweet did much work on the systematic description of vowels, producing an elaborate system of vowel description involving a multitude of symbols. Jones however was the one who is generally credited with having gone much of the way towards a practical solution through his scheme of 'Cardinal Vowels', a relatively simple system of reference vowels which for many years has been taught systematically to students within the British tradition. Much of the inspiration for this scheme can be found in the earlier publications of Paul Passy.", "Apart from his own vast array of published work, Jones will be remembered for having acted as mentor to numerous scholars who later went on to become famous linguists in their own right.

Merritt Ruhlen notes that this definition is not properly taxonomic but amorphous, since there are broader and narrower degrees of relatedness, and moreover, some linguists who broadly accept the concept (such as Greenberg and Ruhlen himself) have criticised the name as reflecting the ethnocentrism frequent among Europeans at the time.Ruhlen 1991: 384-5. Martin Bernal has described the term as distasteful because it implies that speakers of other language families are excluded from academic discussion. Even so, the concept arguably transcends ethnocentric associations.

Both terms are justifiable, but their coexistence is likely to lead to serious confusion.\"  In protruded rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together and the lips protrude like a tube, with their inner surface visible. In compressed rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together, but the lips are also drawn together horizontally (\"compressed\") and do not protrude, with only their outer surface visible. That is, in protruded vowels the inner surfaces of the lips form the opening (thus the alternate term endolabial), whereas in compressed vowels it is the margins of the lips which form the opening (thus exolabial).  observes that back and central rounded vowels, such as German  and , are typically protruded, whereas front rounded vowels such as German  and  are typically compressed. Back or central compressed vowels and front protruded vowels are uncommon, noted that they are less distinctive from unrounded vowels than their counterparts. and a contrast between the two types has been found to be phonemic in only one instance.Japanese has a back compressed  rather than protruded  ; Swedish also has a back compressed   as well as both front compressed   and front protruded   ; the front rounded vowels contrast in ruta 'window pane' and ryta 'roar' ."]}, {"page": "Alexander John Ellis", "response": ["Ellis developed two phonetic alphabets, the English Phonotypic Alphabet (together with Isaac Pitman), which used many new letters, and the Palaeotype alphabet, which replaced many of these with turned letters (such as \u27e8\u0259\u27e9, \u27e8\u0254\u27e9), small caps (such as \u27e8\u026a\u27e9), and italics.

Hazlitt\u2019s  edition of Warton\u2019s History of English Poetry, 1871, expresses a typical 19th century pre-occupation with \u201cfatalism\u201d in the Old English elegies.  Another understanding was offered in the Cambridge Old English Reader, namely that the poem is essentially concerned to state: \"Let us (good Christians, that is) remind ourselves where our true home lies and concentrate on getting there\"Marsden, p. 222", "In Medium \u00c6vum, 1957 and 1959, G. V. Smithers drew attention to the following points in connection with the word anfloga, which occurs in line 62b of the poem:  1. The anfloga  brings about the death of the person speaking.  2.  It is characterized as eager and greedy. 3. It moves through the air. 4. It yells. As a result, Smithers concluded that it is therefore possible that the anfloga designates a valkyrie. Smithers also noted that onw\u00e6lweg in line 63 can be translated as \u201con the death road\u201d,  if the original text is not emended to read on hw\u00e6lweg, or \u201con the whale road [the sea]\u201d. In the unique manuscript of The Seafarer the words are exceptionally clearly written onw\u00e6l weg. This may have some bearing on their interpretation. John R. Clark Hall, in the first edition of his Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, 1894, translated w\u00e6lweg as \"fateful journey\" and \"way of slaughter\", although he changed these translations in subsequent editions. The \"death-way\" reading was adopted by C.W.M.Grein in 1857: auf den Todesweg; by Henry Sweet in 1871: \"on the path of death\", although he changed his mind in 1888; and A.D.Horgan in 1979: \"upon destruction's path\".
