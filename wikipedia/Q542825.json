The book introduced the now-universal practice of listing ingredients and giving suggested cooking times for each recipe. It included the first recipes in English for Brussels sprouts and for spaghetti. It also contains the first recipe for what Acton called \"Christmas pudding\"; the dish was normally called plum pudding, recipes for which had appeared previously, although Acton was the first to put the name and recipe together.\nActon was born in 1799 in Sussex. She was raised in Suffolk where she ran a girls' boarding school before spending time in France. On her return to England in 1826 she published a collection of poetry and released her cookery book in 1845, aimed at middle class families. Written in an engaging prose, the book was well received by reviewers. It was reprinted within the year and several editions followed until 1918, when Longman, the book's publisher, took the decision not to reprint. In 1857 Acton published The English Bread-Book for Domestic Use, a more academic and studious work than Modern Cookery. The work consisted of a history of bread-making in England, a study of European methods of baking and numerous recipes.\nIn the later years of its publication, Modern Cookery was eclipsed by the success of Isabella Beeton's bestselling Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861), which included several recipes plagiarised from Acton's work. Although Modern Cookery was not reprinted in full until 1994, the book has been admired by English cooks in the second part of the 20th century, and influenced many of them, including Elizabeth David, Jane Grigson, Delia Smith and Rick Stein.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Forcemeat", "response": ["Forcemeat (derived from the French farcir, \"to stuff\") is a uniform mixture of lean meat with fat made by grinding, sieving, or pur\u00e9eing the ingredients.  Forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in charcuterie, including quenelles, sausages, p\u00e2t\u00e9s, terrines, roulades, and galantines.  Forcemeats are usually produced from raw meat, except in the case of a gratin.  Meats commonly used include pork, fish (pike, trout, or salmon), seafood, game meats (venison, boar, or rabbit), poultry, game birds, veal, and pork livers.

This preparation was called jelly; English cookery writer Hannah Glasse was the first to record the use of this jelly in trifle in her book The Art of Cookery, first published in 1747.

Anglo-Indian recipes could completely ignore Indian rules of diet, such as by using pork or beef. Some dishes, such as \"liver curry, with bacon\" were simply ordinary recipes spiced up with ingredients such as curry powder. In other cases like kedgeree, Indian dishes were adapted to British tastes; khichari was originally a simple dish of lentils and rice. Curry was accepted in almost all Victorian era cookery books, such as Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families (1845): she offered recipes for curried sweetbreads and curried macaroni, merging Indian and European foods into standard English cooking. By 1895, curry was included in Dainty Dishes for Slender Incomes, aimed at the poorer classes."]}, {"page": "Recipe", "response": ["thumb|from Modern Cookery for Private Families by Eliza Acton (London: Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, 1871. p.48.)", "By the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form.

Although she was not a regular cook, she and Samuel obtained recipes from other sources. A request to receive the readers' own recipes led to over 2,000 being sent in, which were selected and edited by the Beetons.

Suzanne Daly and Ross G. Forman, in their examination of Victorian cooking culture, consider that the plagiarism makes it \"an important index of mid-Victorian and middle-class society\" because the production of the text from its own readers ensures that it is a reflection of what was actually being cooked and eaten at the time. In copying the recipes of others, Beeton was following the recommendation given to her by Henrietta English, a family friend, who wrote that \"Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had. Therefore my advice would be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and Heaven knows there is a great variety for you to choose from.\""]}, {"page": "1859 in literature", "response": ["*February 13 \u2013 Eliza Acton, English cookery writer and poet (born 1799)"]}, {"page": "1845 in literature", "response": ["*Eliza Acton \u2013 Modern Cookery for Private Families"]}, {"page": "1799 in literature", "response": ["*April 17 \u2013 Eliza Acton, English poet and cookery writer (died 1859)"]}, {"page": "Cookbook", "response": ["By the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form.

A popular cake to bake, Victoria sponge (named after Queen Victoria who enjoyed a slice with her tea), was created following the discovery of baking powder by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843, which enabled the sponge to rise higher in cakes.\"The great Victoria sandwich\".
