In a letter to Colonel Frederick Kisch, the chairman of the Zionist Executive wrote that prior to 1929 all the Lebanese communities including the Jews \"showed no interest in the Palestine question\". Even after the riots of 1929, though Jewish interest in Palestine increased it did so only slightly. Instead of seeing themselves as Jews, Lebanese Jews primarily saw themselves as Lebanese citizens. Even Joseph Farhi, who identified himself as a Lebanese Zionist, had the motto \"to be both a good Jew and a good Lebanese citizen\". Amongst the Lebanese Jewry, Judaism was, as Kirsten Shulze writes, \"regarded as a religion, not a nationality or an ideology\". Lebanese Jew\u2019s national identity proved much stronger than their willingness to support the cause of Zionism, or at least their willingness to emigrate. Yet, this fact, this idea of a reluctance of Jews to leave their homes was not unique to Lebanon. In fact many Jews of Arab countries felt strong senses of nationalism toward their home countries and had lived with their Muslim and Christian brethren peacefully for centuries. What made Lebanon unique was the fact that the Lebanese government understood Lebanese Jews to be anti-Zionist and effectively protected them from anti-Jewish violence."]}, {"page": "Yoav Kisch", "response": ["Kisch was born and raised in Tel Aviv.
