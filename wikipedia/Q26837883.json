Yeovil then traveled to fifth placed Wycombe Wanderers and took the lead through a Kevin Dawson penalty but Wycombe equalised through a penalty of their own, as the two clubs shared a 1\u20131 draw. On 17 January, Yeovil announced the loan signing of Andre Wright from West Bromwich Albion until the end of the season, but the following day the loan deal collapsed after it was revealed that Wright's appearance for West Brom's U23 in the EFL Trophy in August counted as a first team appearance and therefore this meant that Wright had already appeared for two clubs during the 2016\u201317 season and so could not be registered for a third. It was also announced that youth team scholar Callum Morton had signed for West Bromwich Albion, and that academy manager Geoff Harrop would be leaving the club at the end of January to rejoin former club Torquay United as general manager."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["|21||Andre Wright||CF||||Sandwell||||0||0||West Bromwich Albion||31 August 2016||Loan||5 January 2017", "| 21 ||  || Andre Wright || FW || 7+4 || 1 || || || 12", "| 21 ||  || Andre Wright || FW || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2", "| 21 ||  || Andre Wright || FW || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|  Andre Wright ||  West Bromwich Albion || 31 August 2016 || 5 January 2017 || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2016 || CF ||  || Andre Wright || Coventry City || 9 January 2017 || ", "| 17 January 2017 || CF ||  || Andre Wright || Yeovil Town || End of Season || "]}, {"page": "Callum Maycock", "response": ["Maycock made his professional debut coming on as a substitute on 6 November 2016 in a 1\u20131 FA Cup draw with Morecambe, coming on to replace Andre Wright."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2017 || CF ||  || Andre Wright || Free agent || Released || "]}, {"page": "List of foreign League of Ireland players", "response": ["* Andre Wright \u2013 Bohemians, Sligo Rovers"]}, {"page": "PFAI Team of the Year", "response": ["!scope=row|Andre Wright "]}, {"page": "2019 Bohemian F.C. season", "response": ["| Andre Wright", "|align=left|  Andre Wright", "|align=left|  Andre Wright ", "|Andre Wright", "|  Andre Wright || UCD || 10\u20131 (H) ||  || Premier Division ", "|Andre Wright"]}, {"page": "2019 FAI Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Andre Wright"]}, {"page": "2020 League of Ireland Premier Division", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Andre Wright", "| colspan=\"4\" |  Andre Wright (Bohemians)"]}, {"page": "2020 Bohemian F.C. season", "response": ["| Andre Wright", "|align=left|  Andre Wright", "| align=left|  Andre Wright", "|align=left|  Andre Wright", "| Andre Wright"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Ayr United F.C. season", "response": ["|Andre Wright"]}, {"page": "2021 Bohemian F.C. season", "response": ["|align=left|  Andre Wright"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Ayr United F.C. season", "response": ["|Andre Wright"]}]}}
