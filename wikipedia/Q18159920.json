She met painter Margot Sandeman, who became a close and lifelong friend. Sandeman and Eardley would often paint together and also shared family holidays and camping trips. In 1941, they acquired a horse and caravan and travelled around Loch Lomond to paint and sketch. For many years, they also visited Corrie on the Isle of Arran, using an outhouse, \"The Tabarnacle\", as a studio.", "By 1942, Eardley had completed the School of Art's General Course and began the diploma course in drawing and painting. The next year she was awarded the diploma in drawing and painting. Her diploma painting, a self-portrait, was her only excursion into formal portraiture and she was awarded the school's Sir James Guthrie Prize for it. Her tutor Hugh Adam Crawford recognised her talent and bought the work to hang in his home. Her biographer Christopher Andreae notes it as nevertheless a remarkably informal picture, a precursor to the charcoal studies she made in Italy and these in turn a preparation for her many drawing, pastels and paintings of Glasgow street children. The prize, a biography of Guthrie by Sir James L. Caw and published by Macmillan & Co. of London in 1932, is still in the possession of Eardley's family."]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"C\"", "response": ["*Hugh Adam Crawford (1898\u20131982), Scottish portrait painter"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish artists", "response": ["*Hugh Adam Crawford (1898\u20131982), painter"]}, {"page": "Hugh Crawford", "response": ["* Hugh Adam Crawford (1898\u20131982), Scottish painter"]}, {"page": "War Artists' Advisory Committee", "response": ["* Hugh Adam Crawford "]}, {"page": "Margot Sandeman", "response": ["Sandeman studied at the Glasgow School of Art, where her contemporaries included Joan Eardley and the poet Ian Hamilton Finlay.
