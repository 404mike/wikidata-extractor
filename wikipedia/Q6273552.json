The memorial marks the site where 'Dick Whittington', returning home discouraged after a disastrous attempt to make his fortune in the City, heard the bells of St Mary-le-Bow ring out, 'Turn again Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor of London.'  On top is the 1964 sculpture of a cat by Jonathan Kenworthy, in polished-black Kellymount limestone. Iron railings, oval in plan, with upper flourishes and spearhead finials above and an intersecting circular return (an \"overthrow\"), surround it.  The stone and railings are negligibly raised by a small broad stone plinth mainly set into the surrounding pavement. It has had statutory protection as listed, in the initial grade II category, since 1972."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Jonathan Kenworthy"]}, {"page": "Grosvenor Gardens", "response": ["The northern garden contains the sculpture Lioness and Lesser Kudu by Jonathan Kenworthy, installed in 2000."]}, {"page": "Kenworthy, Jonathan", "response": ["#redirectJonathan Kenworthy"]}]}}
