He was released without making his league debut at the end of the following season, joining Torquay United in August 1991. He made his debut on the opening day of the following season, playing in Torquay's 3\u20131 win at home to Hartlepool United. He played in the following game, a 3\u20130 defeat away to Preston North End, but was substituted and replaced by Paul Holmes for the next game. He established himself in the second half of the season, but was only on the bench as the 1992\u201393 season began. Three games into the season he dislodged Arron Davis from the Torquay side and had a run in the side at left-back. He began the following season as first choice at left-back in the Torquay side and played 27 times as Torquay reached the play-offs, losing in controversial circumstances against Preston North End.
