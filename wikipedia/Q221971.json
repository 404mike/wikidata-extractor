At the end of the sessions, Allen had invited Blake to be Gong's sound mixer, but Blake preferred to work on his own music. He eventually joined Gong full-time in September 1972 as the band's synthesizer player, being among the first to bring the synthesizer out of the studio and on to the stage. He appears on all three albums of the Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy; Flying Teapot, Angel's Egg, and You, in fact Blake is the only composer, apart from the Allen/Smyth partnership, to have written for all three of the \"Trilogy\" Albums, making him one of Gong's most important composers.  He left Gong in early 1975.\nBlake began a solo career under the name of Crystal Machine produced two solo albums 1977's Crystal Machine and 1978's Blake's New Jerusalem, and many stage performances in Europe and Japan, culminating in the 1979 Glastonbury Festival.\nLater in 1979, Blake joined up with another noted \"space rock\" outfit, Hawkwind, the group he had helped to form 10 years before, for a short stint between 1979 and 1980 and has sporadically rejoined them on several occasions. Since November 2007, Blake has been collaborating with Hawkwind full-time, performing on theremin and what he chooses to call \"virtual lead guitar\" .\nHe has reunited with the 'classic-era' line-up of Gong (minus Pierre Moerlen, who died in May 2005) for one-off concerts, in May 1977, 1995, and in November 2006 at the 3rd Gong Family Unconvention (Uncon) at the Melkweg in Amsterdam.\nBlake's discography contains more than 25 titles, including eight solo albums as Tim Blake - Crystal Machine and he removed all his solo albums from the record market, preferring to make them available for download as mp3s from his own web site.\nAs well as his work with Hawkwind, Blake continues to work with Patrice Warrener on his Chromolithe Illumination System, and doing concerts with Jean-Philippe Rykiel.\nBlake currently lives in the Poitou region of France.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "And did those feet in ancient time", "response": ["Blake's lyrics have also been set to music by other composers without reference to Parry's melody. Tim Blake (synthesiser player of Gong) produced a solo album in 1978 called Blake's New Jerusalem, including a 20-minute track with lyrics from Blake's poem. Mark E. Smith of The Fall interpolated the verses with a deadpan rant against his native land in the track \"Dog is life/Jerusalem\" from the 1988 ballet score \"I Am Kurious Oranj\". The words, with some variations, are used in the track \"Jerusalem\" on Bruce Dickinson's album The Chemical Wedding, which also includes lines from book two of Milton. Finn Coren also created a different musical setting for the poem on his album The Blake Project: Spring. The Verve also referenced the song in their 2008 song Love Is Noise from the album Forth.
