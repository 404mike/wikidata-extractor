He then joined the BBC, originally working for them as a translator, then as a sub-editor in Nairobi. He later worked in the Science and Technology section of the BBC News website, where he was known for his love of complicated gadgetry.\nHe was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme on 29 August 2002, and wrote about his battle against the cancer on the BBC News website in a series entitled Tumour Diary. Noble continued to write stories for the series until 30 January 2005, the day before he died. The tumor left him with serious visual impairments on the right side. In December 2004, having completed several courses of chemotherapy, and after a brief remission, his tumor started to grow again.  Noble enjoyed a huge amount of public support during this period.\nHis final comment before his death ended with the statement \"I will end with a plea. I still have no idea why I ended up with a cancer, but plenty of other cancer patients know what made them ill...If two or three people stop smoking as a result of anything I have ever written then the one of them who would have got cancer will live and all my scribblings [sic] will have been worthwhile.\"Noble died in a London hospice aged 37. He was survived by his wife, Almut, and two children (a son and daughter).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aston University", "response": ["*Ivan Noble, BBC journalist"]}, {"page": "BBC News Online", "response": ["Prior to the adoption of the blog-style, BBC News Online also had a number of topic-specific columns written by BBC journalists, such as  former education correspondent Mike Baker's Mike Baker Weekly, and technology commentator Bill Thompson's bill board (formerly bill blog).

My inclination is to get rid of it but there are some articles , like Ivan Noble, that might be listed under :Category:Cancer but seem a little odd under :Category:Oncology.
