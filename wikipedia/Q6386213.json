On 20 October 2016, it was announced that Hammer would face WBC champion Kali Reis at the Ballhaus Forum in Munich on 5 November. The smaller Reis was very aggressive from the opening to the final bell, kept moving forward and had her moments landing hard hooks to Hammer's head and body. But for most of the ten rounds Hammer managed to keep the distance, establish her jab and fight well from the outside. After ten entertaining rounds judges Ed Pearson, Fernando Laguna, and Grzegorz Molenda unanimously scored the bout 98\u201393, 98\u201393, and 100\u201390 all in favour of Hammer. According to CompuBox, Hammer's usage of her mobility and prolific jab allowed for 24.4 attempts/3.8 connects per two-minute round, while slowing the pace to a comfortable level in wh/ich she averaged 39.7 punches per two-minute round and limited Reis to 33.4. Speaking after her unification, Hammer said \"I have been waiting for this moment for a very long time [...] Like every fighter in the world I dreamed of becoming a WBC world champion and winning the green and gold Belt. This is a very special moment for me. I thank all my fans and my team for the fantastic support.\""]}, {"page": "2004 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Kelly Morgan || 58.98 m"]}, {"page": "2002 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Kelly Morgan || 64.87 m"]}, {"page": "2001 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Kelly Morgan || 54.49 m"]}, {"page": "2000 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Kelly Morgan || 58.45 m"]}, {"page": "List of British champions in javelin throw", "response": ["|Kelly Morgan", "|Kelly Morgan"]}]}}
