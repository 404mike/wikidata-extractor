There his energetic personality soon became apparent in the medical school. His influence was felt in a remodelling of the early years of the medical course, and he persuaded the council that the teaching would have to be divided. In 1922 the new chair of zoology was established. He published in 1920 at New York his Principles of Biochemistry (2nd ed. 1923), and The Chemical Basis of Growth and Senescence in 1923. He had been experimenting on these problems since 1914, and though he was devoting much time to other work, they remained a constant hobby with him for the rest of his life. He was one of the earliest in Australia to investigate the use of insulin for diabetes, and in 1923 he discovered tethelin, a growth controlling substance which has been found of great value in the treatment of slow-healing wounds and ulcers of long standing.", "He was working with great energy, with much mapped out for the coming years, when he contracted pneumonia and died after a short illness on 18 January 1930. He married in 1910 Jane Winifred, third daughter of Sir Edward Stirling. She survived him with two sons and a daughter. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of many other important societies. He was elected a foreign member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rome, in 1926. In addition to the books already mentioned he published in 1914 The Universe and the Mayonnaise and other Stories for Children, and in 1931 a collection of excellent articles of more general appeal than his scientific papers was published under the title The Spirit of Research. He was the virtual founder and was managing editor of the Australian Journal of Experimental Biology and Medical Science from its beginning until his death. Its ninth volume published in 1932, \"The Robertson Memorial Volume\", is made up of scientific papers contributed by former colleagues and pupils, with a short memoir by Hedley R. Marston, and a bibliography of his work which lists 174 of his articles, and 26 others of which he was part author."]}, {"page": "Collingwood Ingram", "response": ["Collingwood Ingram was a son of  Sir William Ingram and  Mary Eliza Collingwood , daughter of Australian politician Edward Stirling.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage 2003, vol. 2, pg 2048Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1886"]}, {"page": "Political families of South Australia", "response": ["*Edward Stirling (1804\u20131873) MLC (single electorate) 1857\u201365"]}, {"page": "John Murray (sheep breeder)", "response": ["Other major South Australian merino breeders J.
