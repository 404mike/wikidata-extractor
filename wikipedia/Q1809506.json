In 1888 he went to Germany, and in 1890 entered the Berlin University, where, under the guidance of Professors Dillmann and Schrader, he devoted himself to the study of Oriental languages, especially Ethiopic.By 1903, Goldschmidt, living at the time in Berlin, had published the following works: \"Das Buch Henoch,\" retranslated from the Ethiopic into Hebrew, and edited with introduction, notes, and explanations (Berlin, 1892); \"Bibliotheca Aethiopica,\" a list and description of all the known Ethiopic prints (Leipsic, 1893); \"Das Buch der Sch\u00f6pfung (\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4),\" critical text, translation notes, etc. (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1894); \"Baraita de-Ma'ase Bereshit,\" the story of the Creation, ascribed to Arzelai bar Bargelai (Strasburg, 1894; this supposed Midrash is an Aramaic translation of the Ethiopic \"Hexaemeron\" of Pseudo-Epiphanias, edited by Trumpp in Ethiopic with a German translation, Munich, 1882, and the name of the supposed author is an anagram of Goldschmidt's Hebrew name, Eliezer ben Gabriel); \"Vita do Abba Daniel,\" Ethiopic text, published, translated, and annotated in collaboration with F.
