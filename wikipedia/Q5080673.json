Marriott played between 1919 and 1938 and was considered one of the best leg-break and googly bowlers of the time. He went on to teach, having served during World War I in the British Army.\nMarriott played in one Test match for the England cricket team in 1933 at the age of 37, taking 11 wickets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hedley Verity", "response": ["In the 1933 season, when Yorkshire won their third consecutive County Championship, Verity took 190\u00a0wickets at an average of 13.43 to be fifth in the national averages; in eight matches he took 10 or more wickets, and achieved five wickets in an innings 18\u00a0times. In seven consecutive innings, he secured a total of 50\u00a0wickets, becoming only the third player to achieve this feat in first-class cricket. He also scored over 600\u00a0runs in the season, his highest aggregate to date, including three fifties \u00a0\u2013 his first in English first-class cricket. Verity represented the Players against the Gentlemen and played in the first two of three Tests against the West Indies, taking four for 45 in the first match and capturing seven wickets at an average of 21.85 in the series. He was left out of the final game in favour of Charles Marriott,Hill, p. 123. but in two other games against the tourists, Verity took a total of 22 wickets. Against Essex, Verity achieved another record by taking 17\u00a0wickets in a single day's play, the second of three players to achieve this feat, on a pitch damaged by rain. In contrast, against Surrey, Yorkshire conceded 560\u00a0runs and Verity, frustrated at the lack of a declaration, first bowled extremely negatively and then bowled two underarm deliveries that the umpire called no-ball as Verity had not informed the batsmen of his intention. This was an unusually public reaction for Verity and his captain ordered him to resume normal bowling.Hill, p. 99. At the end of the season, an MCC team toured India and played Tests there for the first time. Jardine was chosen as captain, and Verity was the only other player from the Bodyline series to tour, although others declined an invitation.Frith, pp. 390\u201391.Douglas, p. 169."]}, {"page": "Heaton Moor", "response": ["Heaton Moor was the birthplace of cricketer Charles Marriott"]}, {"page": "Charlie Marriott", "response": ["#redirectCharles Marriott"]}, {"page": "Father Marriott", "response": ["#redirectCharles Marriott"]}, {"page": "List of nicknames used in cricket", "response": ["* Charles Marriott \u2013 Father Marriott"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Charles Marriott \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Manny Martindale", "response": ["The third and final Test of the summer was anti-climax for the West Indies team, with the match at The Oval lost by an innings after England had the better batting conditions on the Saturday and debutant Charles Marriott took 11 wickets in his only Test.
