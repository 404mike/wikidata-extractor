She made significant contributions to plant palaeontology and coal classification, and was the first female academic on the faculty of the University of Manchester. With her second husband, Humphrey Verdon Roe, Stopes founded the first birth control clinic in Britain. Stopes edited the newsletter Birth Control News, which gave explicit practical advice. Her sex manual Married Love (1918) was controversial and influential, and brought the subject of birth control into wide public discourse. Stopes publicly opposed abortion, arguing that the prevention of conception was all that was needed, though her actions in private were at odds with her public pronouncements.As a supporter of eugenics one of her stated aims was \"to furnish security from conception to those who are racially diseased\". In reaction to this attitude, Marie Stopes International in 2020 changed its name to \"MSI Reproductive Choices\" with no other changes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eugenics", "response": ["Early critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist Lester Frank Ward, the English writer G.

Ward's 1913 article \"Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics\", Chesterton's 1917 book Eugenics and Other Evils, and Boas' 1916 article \"Eugenics\" (published in The Scientific Monthly) were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement.

The British birth control campaigner Marie Stopes made contraception acceptable in Britain during the 1920s by framing it in scientific terms. Stopes assisted emerging birth control movements in a number of British colonies. The birth control movement advocated for contraception so as to permit sexual intercourse as desired without the risk of pregnancy. By emphasizing control, the birth control movement argued that women should have control over their reproduction, an idea that aligned closely to the theme of the feminist movement. Slogans such as \"control over our own bodies\" criticised male domination and demanded women's liberation, a connotation that is absent from the family planning, population control and eugenics movements. In the 1960s and 1970s the birth control movement advocated for the legalisation of abortion and large-scale education campaigns about contraception by governments.

It does not stretch the vagina, nor does it interfere with internal muscle movements during sex, as it is too high up in the vagina. The tip of the penis might touch the condom depending on the position and the size of the penis.  Note that what Stopes calls the \"Dutch cap\" is today known as the \"diaphragm\".
