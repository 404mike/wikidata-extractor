If some actors in a game are placed at a disadvantage in some way, for any reason, it becomes an opportunity for other actors to capitalize on that fact, by using the disadvantage of others to improve their own position \u2013 under conditions where actors both compete and cooperate in different areas. Two classic cases discussed in game theory where opportunism is often involved are the free rider problem and the prisoner's dilemma.Reinhard Bachmann and Akbar Zaheer (eds.), Handbook of trust research. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2006, p. 201. In this game-theoretical sense, Paul Seabright defines opportunism as \"the behaviour of those who seek to benefit from the efforts of others without contributing anything themselves.\"Paul Seabright, The company of strangers: a natural history of economic life. Princeton University Press, 2004, p. 5. Game theory can, for example, model the effects of information asymmetry, where people have unequal access to relevant information, so that those who \"do know\" can take advantage of those who \"don't know\"."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Academics of the University of Cambridge", "response": ["Paul Seabrightnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "List of New College, Oxford people", "response": ["*Paul Seabright, economist"]}, {"page": "List of Old Oundelians", "response": ["*Paul Seabright, academic and writer"]}, {"page": "Seabright", "response": ["*Paul Seabright, professor of Economics at the University of Toulouse, France"]}, {"page": "Philippe Daudy", "response": ["Daudy married first Janine Sommer (marriage dissolved), by whom he had two daughters, Martine and Florence, who both live and work in Paris.
