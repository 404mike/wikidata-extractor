Heatley previously played for Cliftonville, Newry City, Brantwood and Carrick Rangers before joining Crusaders in 2013. He was named as Ulster Footballer of the Year and Northern Ireland Football Writers' Player of the Year for 2014\u201315.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crusaders F.C.", "response": ["The 2014\u201315 season was a groundbreaking one for Crusaders. The season started with the side earning their first win in European competition for 18 years, defeating FK Ekranas of Lithuania in the UEFA Europa League 3\u20131 at home. In the return leg, Crusaders earned their first ever away victory in Europe, winning 2\u20131 thanks to two goals from Paul Heatley, and earning their first aggregate victory in Europe. In the second qualifying round, Crusaders bowed out against Swedish side IF Brommapojkarna after a 1\u20134 aggregate defeat. In cup competition, Crusaders reached the quarter-final of the Northern Ireland Football League Cup and the semi-final of the County Antrim Shield, losing both ties to Bangor, and the semi-final of the Irish Cup, losing out to Glentoran. Despite this, the side saved their best performances for the league, going unbeaten from December to April and winning 12 of 13 games. A 1\u20130 derby victory away to Cliftonville thanks to a Paul Heatley goal all but sealed the title, with a 2\u20130 home win the following week against Glentoran with goals from Declan Caddell and yet another from Heatley confirming the Gibson Cup's place at Seaview.", "However, the Hatchetmen bounced back in the 2017\u201318 season, regaining the Gibson Cup in a title race that went to the final day of the season. In the end, it was a 2\u20131 victory at the Ballymena Showgrounds on 28 April 2018 that brought the league title back to Seaview for the 3rd time in 4 years, thanks to goals from Philip Lowry and David Cushley, after Cathair Friel opened the scoring for Ballymena United and threatened to send the title to eventual runners-up Coleraine. Crusaders also won the County Antrim Shield at the Ballymena Showgrounds after a 4-2 victory over Ballymena United on 23 January 2018. Crusaders finished the season having scored an incredible 106 league goals, with over half of this tally coming from the attacking trio of Paul Heatley, Gavin Whyte and Jordan Owens."]}, {"page": "Ulster Footballer of the Year", "response": ["|  2014\u201315 || ||align=left| Paul Heatley || align=left| Crusaders||"]}, {"page": "North Belfast derby", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Paul Heatley ||  Crusaders || 12 || - || - || -|| 3 || - || - || - || 15"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Football League", "response": ["||Paul Heatley (Crusaders)Andrew Waterworth (Linfield)"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 NIFL Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Paul Heatley"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 NIFL Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Paul Heatley"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 NIFL Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Paul Heatley"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 NIFL Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Paul Heatley"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 NIFL Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Paul Heatley"]}, {"page": "Heatley, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Heatley"]}]}}
