After a spell with the British Forces Broadcasting Service, Scragg joined Essex Radio in September 1981 as part of its launch team, and was the first voice heard on the station.  Jon has subsequently held the position of breakfast presenter at a number of other radio stations. \nJon has been heard on Beacon Radio, 2-Ten FM and Radio Mercury, where he joined as afternoon host, but swiftly moved to the breakfast slot, affectionately remembered for his warm style and features such as the 'Birthday Stars' and 'Secret Song'. In 1994 Scragg joined Country 1035. He then moved to Jazz FM in 1997, winning a Sony award for his 'In the Morning and A Bit in the Afternoon' programme.\nJon remained with Jazz FM following its rebrand to 102.2 Smooth FM in 2005, but left the station in November that year after being removed from a regular weekday slot. He moved to Norwich to join Classic Gold as Drive presenter. However, he was unable to start the job because of major heart surgery which required a long recovery period. When he was thirteen years old Jon was diagnosed with the genetic kidney disorder Polycystic kidney disease, and in October 2010 Jon suffered kidney failure and now requires dialysis three times a week.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Brand New Heavies", "response": ["The group came up with the Heavies name after signing their first record contract, borrowing from a liner note on a James Brown single declaring the artist \"Minister of New Super Heavy Funk\".Interview with Jon Scragg, Jazz FM 102.2 (London), 22 October 2004.

It replaced 102.2 Jazz FM on 7 June 2005 at 10\u00a0am, with the help of R&B singer Lemar and the then breakfast show host Jon Scragg. The first track played, keeping with the name of the newly launched radio station was Sade Adu's \"Smooth Operator\", and was owned by the radio division of the Guardian Media Group, GMG Radio. Following disappointing audience figures, the station was closed on 23 March 2007 and relaunched as 102.2 Smooth Radio the following Monday, following a successful format change request to Ofcom to play music oriented at listeners aged 50 and above.", "*Jon Scragg"]}, {"page": "Country 1035", "response": ["The first song played was Brooks' Friends in Low Places (which was voted #1 country song ever by listeners of the station a few months later), the second was another Brooks song The Dance. The station's early line up included such well-known presenters such as Chris Grant, Jon Scragg, Randall Lee Rose, Peter Quinn, Paul Hollingdale, David Allan and Bryan Chalker. Chalker was subsequently dismissed for disciplinary reasons. David Allan left the station, going back to BBC Radio 2 and in an article for Country Music People magazine he criticized the station for not playing enough true country music."]}]}}
