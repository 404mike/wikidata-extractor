Rotherham took the lead against the run of the play just before half-time, Nicky Law finding the net on the counterattack. After the interval, Stevenage pressed for an equaliser, and restored parity with just eight minutes left; John Mousinho scoring his first goal for the club after David Bridges had seen his initial shot saved. A week later, Stevenage entertained Burton Albion at Broadhall Way, with the score ending 2\u20131 to the hosts, Stevenage's first home win since August. Stevenage had the chance to take the lead early on after referee Trevor Kettle decided that Chris Holroyd had been pushed in the area by Burton defender Nathan Stanton. Holroyd subsequently missed the resulting penalty kick. Stevenage were awarded another penalty ten minutes before the interval, this time Lawrie Wilson was the player to be fouled. Regular penalty taker Scott Laird stepped up and scored the resulting spot-kick. Shortly after the interval, Burton equalised; long-serving Aaron Webster arriving late into the box to finish neatly and restore parity. Ten minutes later, the home side were in front once again, Holroyd making amends for his penalty miss by scoring on the half-volley following good work down the right wing by Wilson. Substitute Luke Foster was sent-off with twenty minutes left, but Stevenage held on to take the three points. Stevenage then travelled to the Globe Arena to face Morecambe, a game that ended 0\u20130. Scott Laird saw his penalty saved for the visitors five minutes into the second half after Garry Hunter had handballed in the area.
