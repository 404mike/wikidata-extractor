She won a bronze medal in the 3000 metres at the 1988 Olympic Games, and gold medals at this distance at the 1987 European Indoor Championships, the 1993 World Indoor Championships and the 1990 European Championships. She also won a gold medal in the 10,000 metres at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. Her 3000 metres best of 8:29.02 was set in the Olympic Final of 1988.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 4", "response": ["*  1964   \u2013 Yvonne Murray, Scottish runner"]}, {"page": "1964", "response": ["* October 4 \u2013 Yvonne Murray, Scottish athlete"]}, {"page": "Sonia O'Sullivan", "response": ["During 1994, O'Sullivan dominated international distance running. She set the fastest time of the year in four events, the 1500\u00a0m, 1\u00a0mile, 2000\u00a0m and 3000\u00a0m, and the second fastest time in the 5000\u00a0m. On 8 July, at Edinburgh, she broke the 2000\u00a0m world record, setting a new time of 5:25.36. This record stood until Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia broke it on 7 February 2017. The next week, in London, she broke the European record for the 3000\u00a0m, beating Britain's Yvonne Murray, and setting the year's fastest time of 8:21.64. This moved her to fifth on the all-time world list, behind the four Chinese runners who had set their personal bests at the 1993 National Championships in Beijing. This record lasted until 2002, when Gabriela Szabo bettered it. Only three days later, at Nice, O'Sullivan recorded the year's fastest 1500\u00a0m, a personal best, of 3:59.10, and only four days after that, she won the mile at the Bislett Games in Oslo, in a time of 4:17.25. This was the season's best, and it moved O'Sullivan to fourth on the all-time world list. All four of these times were also new Irish records, and after this two-week period of record breaking, O'Sullivan became a clear favourite to win any event she chose to compete in at the European Athletics Championships in Helsinki in August. At Helsinki, O'Sullivan elected to only contest the 3000\u00a0m, with her main opposition expected to come from Yvonne Murray. In the final, on 10 August, Murray set the pace with O'Sullivan on her shoulder. With 200\u00a0m to go, O'Sullivan surged past Murray to win easily in 8:31.84. O'Sullivan followed this with a win over 5000\u00a0m in the Grand Prix final in Paris on 3 September. She finished the Grand Prix season in 3rd place in the Woman's Overall standings. At the end of a long season, on 9 September, the tired O'Sullivan finished only fifth in the 1500\u00a0m at the World Cup in London."]}, {"page": "Musselburgh", "response": ["*Yvonne Murray, athlete"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1988 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Yvonne Murray \u2014 Athletics, Women's 3.000 metres"]}, {"page": "1986 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Yvonne Murray||8:37.15"]}, {"page": "1990 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Yvonne Murray||8:43.06"]}, {"page": "1994 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Yvonne Murray||8:36.48"]}, {"page": "Murray (surname)", "response": ["*Yvonne Murray (born 1964), Scottish athlete"]}, {"page": "Scottish Sports Hall of Fame", "response": ["*Yvonne Murray (born 1964)"]}, {"page": "BBC Scotland Sports Personality of the Year", "response": ["|1994 || Yvonne Murray || Athlete || Scottish Sport Hall of Fame 2007 inductees Herald Scotland, 12 March 2007"]}, {"page": "Yvonne Murray-Mooney", "response": ["#REDIRECT Yvonne Murray"]}, {"page": "List of British records in athletics", "response": ["|Yvonne Murray"]}]}}
