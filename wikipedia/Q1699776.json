A similar treatment is supposed to have been given to babies of other prisons like S-21, spread all over Democratic Kampuchea. S-21 also had a few Westerners who had been captured by the regime. One was the British teacher John Dawson Dewhirst, captured by the Khmer Rouge while he was on a yacht. One guard of S-21, Cheam Soeu, said that one of the Westerners had been burned alive, but Kang Kek Iew (\"Comrade Duch\") denied that. He said that Pol Pot asked him to burn their corpses (after death) and that \"nobody would dare to violate my order\". Tortures were not only meant to force prisoners to confess but for the prison guards' amusement. They feared that they would themselves become prisoners if they treated the prisoners well."]}, {"page": "Dewhirst", "response": ["* John Dawson Dewhirst (1952\u2013c.1978), British teacher and yachtsman "]}, {"page": "Bou Meng", "response": ["* John Dawson Dewhirst"]}, {"page": "List of solved missing person cases: pre-2000", "response": ["|John Dawson Dewhirst", "|John Dawson Dewhirst was a British teacher and amateur yachtsman and disappeared after being captured and detained as a suspected spy by the Khmer Rouge August 13, 1978.
