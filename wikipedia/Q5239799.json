Over time, Ruby eventually accepts Tina, and they settle their time with Johnny as a family. However, Johnny soon tires of Tina and proceeds to cheat on her with Amy (Nina Fry) \u2014 one of the barmaids working at Scarlet. During this time, he plans to expand his business empire by putting in an offer for The Queen Vic. The result of this sparks a conflict with Sam's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor), after Johnny outbids her offer to buy the pub. It is soon revealed that there is history between the two; her deceased husband Eric had worked for Johnny, many years earlier, and they shared an earlier connection with boxing. Generally, Johnny had mistreated Eric \u2014 who would end up abusing Peggy as a result; Peggy subsequently blamed Johnny for being the reason why Eric took his frustrations out on her. Peggy also has knowledge of Johnny's past crimes, such as cutting the fingers off the hand of a prostitute named Suzy Laura, and brutally beating up his old friend Dougie Collins (David Simeon) for a slight misspelling on a birthday cake. She soon exposes this in front of the residents, upon encountering Johnny in the pub. Peggy goes on to describe Johnny's character as a thief and that he has extorted people, before proceeding to accuse him of being a murderer \u2014 which is later proven to be correct, even though Peggy is among the residents left unaware of Andy's fate. Ruby walks into the pub as the story unravels, and soon begins to learn of her father's true past \u2014 including that he may be to blame for the deaths of her mother and sister."]}, {"page": "End of Part One", "response": ["The cast included Sue Holderness, Denise Coffey, Fred Harris, Dudley Stevens, David Simeon, and Tony Aitken.
