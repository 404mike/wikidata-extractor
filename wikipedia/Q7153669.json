Wigan manager John Benson, who was taking charge of the team for the last time before the appointment of a new manager, picked the same eleven players who had started the second leg of the play-off semi-final; the line-up included five players who had played at Wembley in the previous season's Football League Trophy final.  There was media speculation that Benson would recall goalkeeper Carroll, by now fully recovered from his operation,  but ultimately he opted to again select Stillie, and Carroll was named as one of the substitutes.Classic Match : Wigan Athletic 2\u20133 Gillingham (AET) 2000 Division 2 Play-off Final, 00:01:04\u201300:01:13  Stuart Barlow, the club's top goalscorer during the regular season, had recently recovered from an operation on his ankle and it was anticipated that he would be named as a substitute, but he was ultimately named in the starting line-up.

Wigan manager John Benson had already announced before the play-off final that he would be leaving his post whatever the result, and he was replaced by Bruce Rioch.  Following Taylor's departure, Paul Smith withdrew his transfer request, intimating that he no longer felt the need to leave the club now that Taylor had departed; he would remain at the club for a further five years.
