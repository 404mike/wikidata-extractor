In 1921 the Privy Council was asked to nominate a lawyer of standing to preside over the council's judicial sub-committee. Priestley was recommended by Sir Almeric FitzRoy, Clerk of the Privy Council, as a man of 'agreeable manner and tactful.' Although the Minister of Health had no power under the Act to appoint a Chairman of the Council, he appointed Priestley to the position, 'since he was associated with neither the College nor the Central Committee and could therefore be regarded as impartial.'Anne Marie Rafferty, The Politics of Nursing Knowledge (1996), p. 100. In July 1921 the Council announced it had framed, and the Minister of Health had approved, rules for the admission of nurses to an official register under the Act of 1919, and the register was opened. In the following months \"lay\" and \"professional\" members of the Council differed over the appointment of the first Registrar, and whether nurses' qualifications should be entered in the register. The controversy became so severe that by the end of the year the majority of members of the Council \u2013 including Priestley \u2013 had resigned.The Times (Saturday, 30 July 1921), p. 7; (Friday, 9 December 1921), p. 10; (Friday, 27 January 1922), p. 10."]}, {"page": "Almeric Fitzroy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Almeric FitzRoy"]}]}}
