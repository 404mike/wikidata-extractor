He founded Thomas Crapper & Co in London, a sanitary equipment company. Crapper held nine patents, three of them for water closet improvements such as the floating ballcock. He improved the S-bend plumbing trap in 1880 by inventing the U-bend. The firm's lavatorial equipment was manufactured at premises in nearby Marlborough Road (now Draycott Avenue). The company owned the world's first bath, toilet and sink showroom in King's Road. Crapper was noted for the quality of his products and received several royal warrants.\nManhole covers with Crapper's company's name on them in Westminster Abbey have become one of London's minor tourist attractions.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 27", "response": ["*1910 \u2013 Thomas Crapper, English plumber and businessman (b. 1836)"]}, {"page": "September 28", "response": ["*1836 \u2013 Thomas Crapper, English plumber, invented the ballcock (d. 1910)"]}, {"page": "1910", "response": ["* January 27 \u2013 Thomas Crapper, British plumber (b. 1836)"]}, {"page": "1836", "response": ["* September 26 \u2013 Thomas Crapper, English plumber, inventor (d. 1910)"]}, {"page": "Penge", "response": ["*Thomas Crapper, the famous Victorian manufacturing plumber, retired to live at 12 Thornsett Road (c. 1897\u20131910).
