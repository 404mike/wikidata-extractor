He won a gold medal in the four-man bobsleigh event at the 1938 FIBT World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Mackintosh also became Chairman of the Henry Lunn Alpine Tours company (part of the Lunn Poly group) and President of the Amateur Inter-Ski Club, the Kandahar Ski Club.\nMackintosh competed in skiing from 1923 to 1933. He finished sixth in the men's long jump at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. He also won the Inferno ski race, the third time it was held.\nHe married Lady Jean Douglas-Hamilton, daughter of Duke Alfred Douglas-Hamilton and his wife, the animal welfare activist Nina Poore.  Chris and Jean's four children, Sheena Mackintosh, Vora Mackintosh, Douglas Mackintosh, and Charlach Mackintosh all represented Great Britain in skiing events in the Winter Olympics.\nThe Mackintosh surname is not Scottish.  It is derived from Chris's paternal grandfather, Aeneas John Mackintosh and great grandfather John McIntosh. Aeneas was a picture-framer from Bethnal Green, London who worked for and married Marie Anna Rochefort. Her framing business traded as \"Marian Rochefort\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick McEvoy", "response": ["At the same event in 1938 three of the four-man riders returned to defend their title.

Both men partnered again the following year and, alongside two new team-mates, won silver in the four-man event at Cortina d'Ampezzo."]}]}}
