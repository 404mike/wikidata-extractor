He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace round-arm bowler who played first-class cricket for Lancashire. He was born in Glossop.\nPlaying his club cricket with Cheetham Hill, Smith made two first-class appearances in 1867. His first, against Surrey, saw him score twelve runs in the single innings in which Lancashire were called to bat, and saw him bowl 15 overs.\nSmith's second and final appearance came as an opening batsman in a defeat against Marylebone Cricket Club, in which he bowled economically, but failed to impress with the bat.\nSmith later umpired two games during the 1880 season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Smith", "response": ["Thomas Smith may refer to:", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Midhurst), MP for Midhurst", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Great Bedwyn) (1382\u20131399), English politician", "*Thomas Smith (MP for New Romney) (1419\u20131432), MP for New Romney", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Dover), 1470\u20131471 ", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Bristol), 1512, MP for Bristol", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Chippenham), 1554", "*Sir Thomas Smith (diplomat) (1513\u20131577), English scholar and diplomat", "*Thomas Smith (MP for multiple constituencies) (1522\u20131591), Member of Parliament for Tavistock, Aylesbury, Rye, Winchelsea and Portsmouth", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Wigan), MP for Wigan, 1558", "*Thomas Smith (English judge) (c. 1556\u20131609), member of Parliament for Cricklade, and for Tamworth", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Sudbury), MP for Sudbury, 1626", "*Thomas Smith (governor of South Carolina) (1648\u20131694), governor of South Carolina, planter, merchant and surgeon", "*Thomas Smith (died 1728) (c. 1686\u20131728), British Whig politician, MP for four constituencies 1709\u20131728", "*Thomas Smith (Royal Navy officer) (1707\u20131762), governor of Newfoundland and Labrador", "*Thomas Smith (Pennsylvania congressman) (bef. 1782\u20131846), Federalist member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania", "*Thomas Smith (Indiana congressman) (1799\u20131876), member of the United States House of Representatives from Indiana", "*Thomas Smith (Oregon politician), member of the Oregon Territorial Legislature, 1855\u20131856", "*Thomas Smith (Upper Canada politician) (1754\u20131833), land surveyor, merchant and politician in Upper Canada", "*Thomas Smith (Australian politician) (1846\u20131925), Victorian politician", "*Sir Thomas Smith (Chester MP), English politician who sat in the House of Commons, 1640\u20131644", "*Sir Thomas Smith, 1st Baronet, of Hatherton (1622\u20131675), English politician", "*Thomas Smith (Cavalier) (1609\u20131642), English Member of Parliament", "*Thomas Smith (East India Company) (1558\u20131625), English merchant, politician and first governor of the East India Company", "*Thomas Smith (Lord Mayor of London) (1746\u20131823), merchant and Lord Mayor of London", "*Thomas Smith (Pennsylvania judge) (1745\u20131809), politician and judge from Pennsylvania", "*Thomas Smith (English judge) (1556?\u20131609), Master of Requests", "*Thomas Smith (English soldier) (fl. 1600\u20131627), English soldier", "*Thomas Smith (Medal of Honor, 1865) (1838\u20131905), American Civil War sailor", "*Thomas Smith (Medal of Honor, 1869), American Indian Wars soldier", "*Thomas Smith (Medal of Honor, 1878) (1856\u2013?), American sailor", "*Thomas Smith (Registrary) (fl. late 16th century), fourth recorded Registrary of the University of Cambridge", "*Thomas Smith (banker) (1631\u20131699), founder of the first bank in England outside London", "*Thomas Smith (engineer) (1752\u20131814), Scottish businessman and lighthouse engineer", "*Thomas Smith (scientist), geophysicist", "*Thomas Smith (headmaster) (1814\u20131879), Governor of Elmfield College (1868-?)", "*Sir Thomas Smith (barrister) (1915\u20131988), lawyer, soldier and academic", "*Thomas Smith (finance professor) (born 1958), Australian finance professor", "*Thomas Smith & Sons, crane manufacturers of Rodley, West Yorkshire, UK", "*Sir Thomas Smith, 1st Baronet, of Stratford Place (1833\u20131909), British surgeon", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1848) (1848\u2013?), English cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1854) (1854\u2013?), English cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1898) (1898\u20131926), Australian cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1899) (1899\u20131965), English cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1905) (1905\u20131993), English cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (Australian footballer) (1851\u20131909), Australian footballer", "*Thomas Smith (cornerback) (born 1970), American professional football player", "*Thomas Smith (English footballer) (1869\u2013?), English footballer", "*Thomas Smith (Scottish footballer) (born 1908), Scottish footballer", "*Thomas Smith (sport shooter) (born 1931), American Olympic shooter", "*R.
