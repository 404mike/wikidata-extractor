From 1884 to 1890 Horsley was Professor-Superintendent of the Brown Institute. In 1886, he was appointed as Assistant Professor of Surgery at the National Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy, and as a Professor of Pathology (1887\u20131896) and Professor of Clinical Surgery (1899\u20131902) at University College London.

The Horsley\u2013Clarke apparatus used a Cartesian (three-orthogonal axis) system.  That device is in the Science Museum, London; a copy was brought to the US by Ernest Sachs and is in the Department of Neurosurgery at UCLA.  Clarke used the original to do research that led to publications of primate and cat brain atlases.  There is no evidence it was ever used in a human surgery.  The first stereotactic device designed for the human brain appears to have been an adaptation of the Horseley\u2013Clarke frame built at Aubrey T. Mussen's behest by a London workshop in 1918, but it received little attention and does not appear to have been used on people.

Three years later, Victor Horsley (1857\u20131916) was the first physician to remove a spinal tumour. On 16 March 1907 Austrian surgeon Hermann Schloffer became the first to successfully remove a pituitary tumor.

During this procedure he noted compression of the nerve by vascular loops, and in 1932 proposed the theory that trigeminal neuralgia was caused by compression of the nerve by blood vessels, typically the superior cerebellar artery.Dandy WE.

Jannetta was able to further confirm this theory in 1967 and advocated moving the offending vessel and placing a sponge to prevent the vessel from returning to its native position as a treatment for trigeminal neuralgia.Jannetta PJ.
