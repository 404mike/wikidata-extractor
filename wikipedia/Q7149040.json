Most of these are with other London clubs, especially with Tottenham Hotspur in an East versus North London derby and with Chelsea in an East versus West London rivalry.

The rivalry deepened with the appointment of former Hammers manager Harry Redknapp as Tottenham's manager. Since the 2006\u201307 Premier League season, West Ham have developed a strong rivalry with Yorkshire club Sheffield United due to the dubious circumstances surrounding the transfer of Carlos Tevez, who helped West Ham avoid relegation at Sheffield United's expense.", "|1985|| Paul Allen|| Tony Cottee"]}, {"page": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C.", "response": ["*  Paul Allen", "* 1991  Paul Allen"]}, {"page": "Martin Allen", "response": ["His cousins, Paul Allen, Bradley Allen and Clive Allen, were also footballers, as was his uncle Les Allen.
