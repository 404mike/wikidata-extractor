Notable examples of British socialites include Beau Brummell, Lord Alvanley, the Marchioness of Londonderry, Daisy, Princess of Pless, Lady Diana Cooper, Mary Constance Wyndham, Lady Ursula d'Abo, Margaret Greville and the Mitford sisters. Since the 1960s, socialites have been drawn from a wider section of society more similar to the American model, with many socialites now coming from families in business or from the world of celebrity. Despite this, the notion of the Sloane ranger still emphasises many socialites' connections to Britain's ruling class. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is widely regarded as the current home of socialite activity in the UK. The television show Made in Chelsea has explored the lifestyles of young socialites living in London in the 21st century."]}, {"page": "Princess Daisy (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Daisy, Princess of Pless (1873\u20131943), British-born socialite and German princess"]}, {"page": "Princess Daisy of Pless", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daisy, Princess of Pless"]}, {"page": "Mary-Theresa Olivia Cornwallis-West", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daisy, Princess of Pless"]}, {"page": "Mary Theresa Olivia Cornwallis-West", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daisy, Princess of Pless"]}, {"page": "Mary Theresa Cornwallis-West", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daisy, Princess of Pless"]}, {"page": "Mary-Theresa Cornwallis-West", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daisy, Princess of Pless"]}, {"page": "Lady Blanche Addle", "response": ["Lady Blanche Addle was a fictitious character created by the British author Mary Dunn (1900\u20131958) First published in the 1930s Dunn's Lady Addle books amusingly parody and satirise the then British upper classes, and particularly the works of Walburga, Lady Paget;  Daisy, Princess of Pless  and Adeline, Countess of Cardigan and Lancastre.

If there was no male heir to Mecklenburg-Strelitz the grand duchy would merge with the neighboring Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. During the war the topic of marriage was discussed by Adolf Friedrich and his friend Daisy, Princess of Pless, however in wartime it was very difficult to arrange a meeting with an eligible princess. Eventually, Daisy identified her husband's relative, Princess Benigna Reuss of K\u00f6stritz (1892\u20131983) as a suitable bride. She was daughter of Prince Heinrich XXVIII Reuss of K\u00f6stritz (1859\u20131924) and Countess Magdalene of Solms-Laubach (1863\u20131925). As Adolf Friedrich was agreeable to the match his Minister-President Heinrich Bossart started negotiations with the future bride's family to bring about the marriage. However, before the engagement could be announced there was the complication of a connection to a woman whom Adolf Friedrich needed to be freed from. Rumor has it that the woman in question was Margrit H\u00f6llrigl, Countess Bubna of Litic with whom he had a relationship while he was based in Potsdam. Because of this, the previously arranged marriage to Princess Benigna never materialized and after this she never married."]}, {"page": "List of nicknames of European royalty and nobility: D", "response": ["* Daisy, Princess of Pless"]}, {"page": "Pszczyna Castle", "response": ["* Daisy, Princess of Pless"]}, {"page": "Duchy of Pless", "response": ["The Dukes of Anhalt-K\u00f6then-Pless inherited it in 1765 (being descended from the earlier dukes in the female line), the last of them died in 1847, and was succeeded by his nephew, Hans Heinrich X, Count of Hochberg, and first president of the Prussian House of Lords.
