Before hitting his teens, he secured representation with New Zealand's first professional talent agency, founded by former wrestler Robert Bruce. Reid acted on stage and television alongside such stalwarts as Deryck Guyler, George Henare and Billy T. James. At Auckland Grammar he was president of the Senior Film Society and a member of Bel Canto choir, led by David Hamilton. At sixteen he directed a season of Godspell and, years later, his work as a theatre director was garnering excellent reviews. Of his production of Amadeus, The New Zealand Herald wrote: \"The multi-talented Mr Reid...directs with scrupulous care and refreshing confidence.\"Rae, Bernadette, \"In Granddad's Line of Vision\", The New Zealand Herald, 23 June 1990, Section 2, pg. 4. Reviewing his production of The Crucible, The Strip magazine wrote: \"Gabriel Reid is a clever, tightly disciplined, diligent director, with a bold and clear eye for design. This totally satisfying production coaxed new subtleties from the script \u2014 which could become far too dramatic for its own good in the hands of a less questioning director \u2014 yet diluted none of its power. It was craft and precision that fused this production into an example which could inspire even more experienced directors.\"Hooper, Michael, \"Crucible Stirred Briskly\", The Strip, June 1996."]}, {"page": "Robert Bruce (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Bruce or Robert the Bruce may also refer to:", "*Robert Bruce, Lord of Liddesdale (died 1332), illegitimate son of Robert the Bruce", "*Robert Bruce, 2nd Baron of Clackmannan (died 1403)", "*Robert Bruce, 3rd Baron of Clackmannan (died 1436)", "*Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury (1626\u20131685), English politician", "*Robert Bruce (Yukon politician) (born 1940), former Speaker of the Yukon Legislative Assembly", "*Robert Bruce (New Zealand politician) (1843\u20131917), Scottish born, New Zealand politician and conservationist", "*Robert Bruce (footballer) (1895\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "*Robert Bruce (wrestler) (1943\u20132009), Scottish-born New Zealand professional wrestler and talent agent", "*Robert Bruce (swimmer) (born 1969), Australian former swimmer", "*Robert Bruce (Scottish composer) (1915\u20132012), composer and lecturer", "*Robert Bruce (opera), an 1846 pastiche opera with music taken from works by Gioachino Rossini", "*Robert Bruce (rapper) (born 1970), American rapper, Psychopathic Records don, and professional wrestler", "*Robert Bruce of Kinnaird (1554\u20131631), Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1588 and again in 1592", "*Robert Bruce (Pitt Chancellor) (1778\u20131846), professor and pastor, first Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, 1819\u20131935 and 1836\u20131843", "*Robert Bruce, Lord Kennet (1718\u20131785), Scottish advocate, legal scholar and judge", "*Robert Bruce (1668\u20131720), Russian general of Scottish background, brother of Jacob Bruce", "*Robert Bruce (merchant adventurer), Scottish adventurer and son of Chief Justice of Barbados Sir James Bruce", "*Robert Bruce (tea planter) (died 1824), pioneer in the field of tea plantations in Assam", "*Robert Bruce (active 1870\u20131900), missionary who revised Henry Martyn's Bible translations into Persian", "*Robert Bruce (British Army officer, born 1813) (1813\u20131862), British Army officer", "*Robert Bruce (British Army officer, born 1821) (1821\u20131891), British Army officer, colonel of the Queen's Royal Regiment"]}]}}
