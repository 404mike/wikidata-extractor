Two of them (Edward Talbot and Walter Lock) were former Wardens of the college; the other two, Sir Wilmot Herringham (a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of London) and Sir Reginald Craddock (a former Lieutenant-Governor of Burma), had studied at Keble College before achieving prominence in public life. Honorary Fellows have included former students (Old Members), Fellows, and Wardens, as well as some with no previous academic connection to the college.  In this latter group there are benefactors (for example Sir Anthony O'Reilly, elected 2002), and individuals of distinction such as former U.S. President Ronald Reagan (elected 1994) and the poet Sir John Betjeman (elected 1972).  Betjeman, who studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, was involved in Keble's centenary appeal in 1970: The Times said in its obituary of him that the Honorary Fellowship was particularly appropriate because of the college's \"architectural and Anglican connotations\", Betjeman having strong interests in both areas. As of July 2011, the longest-serving Honorary Fellows are Raoul Franklin and Dennis Nineham, both of whom were elected in 1980. The three longest-serving Honorary Fellows are Sir John Forsdyke (Principal Librarian of the British Museum; appointed 1937, died 1979), Sir Thomas Armstrong (conductor; appointed 1955, died 1994) and Harry Carpenter (Warden, later Bishop of Oxford; appointed 1960, died 1993)."]}, {"page": "Christiana Herringham", "response": ["Christiana Jane Powell was born in Kent and was the daughter of Thomas Wilde Powell, a wealthy patron of the Arts and Crafts Movement. One of her siblings was Mary Elizabeth Turner. From shortly after her mother's death in 1871, to her marriage, she ran her father's household. After a courtship in 1878 and 1879 marked by tension between her independence and his conventional Anglican upbringing, in 1880 she married the physician Wilmot Herringham, with whom she had two sons. ", "Wilmot Herringham left the couple's art collection, and a number of Christiana's paintings, to Bedford New College and to Newnham College. Royal Holloway, University of London now owns a large collection of Herringham's works, of those originally left to Bedford New College, remaining in the College gallery and archive.", "Christiana and Wilmot Herringham had two sons. Christopher (1882\u20131893) died of rheumatoid arthritis. Geoffrey (1883\u20131914) was a professional soldier, killed at the Battle of Messines at the beginning of World War I.", "Her biographer Mary Lago suggests Christiana Herringham may have been the inspiration for Mrs Moore in E. M. Forster's 1924 novel A Passage to India. The Herringhams were family friends of the Forsters, through Forster's Aunt Laura; and Forster dined with Wilmot Herringham, William Rothenstein and Rabindranath Tagore in 1912, before his journey to India. Lago makes a case that the Adela Quested character in the novel is based on a travelling companion of the Herringhams on their 1906 voyage out."]}, {"page": "List of vice-chancellors of the University of London", "response": ["*1912\u20131915 Sir Wilmot Herringham KCMG CB"]}, {"page": "General Nursing Council", "response": ["In 1922 elections were held for the nursing places on the council. 12,000 registered nurses were eligible to vote. 11 were elected by the general nurses (6 of these had to be matrons) and 5 from the supplementary registers for mental health nursing, paediatric nursing and male nurses.
