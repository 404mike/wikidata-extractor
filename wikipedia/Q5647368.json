He joined Pontypridd where his natural ability was polished by endless training sessions under the tutorship of groundsman Dick Coates.Davies (1980), p. 307 It was while with Pontypridd that Davies was first called to the Wales national squad. His first cap was against Scotland in the 1947 Five Nations Championship, partnered at fly half with Haydn Tanner. Wales were comfortable winners, but the next game Davies was replaced by Billy Cleaver and Davies failed to be reselected for the rest of the campaign.
