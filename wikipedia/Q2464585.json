For example, in 1857 Brasseur identified Votan as a Phoenician ruler who founded Palenque and in an article published in 1872 attributed mythological Mesoamerican cataclysms to an early version of pole shift theory. Brasseur's work, some of which was illustrated by the talented but very inaccurate Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Waldeck, influenced other works of pseudoscience and pseudohistory, such as the research of D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charnay, Augustus Le Plongeon, Ignatius L.

Emerson of Brooklyn, a self-proclaimed Maya priest who edited a serial publication titled The Mayan, Devoted to Spiritual Enlightenment and Scientific Religion between 1933 and 1941.
