His touchline ban was given over commenting made about a referee's decisions made in a match between Celtic and St Johnstone. Following a controversial penalty in a 2\u20130 defeat against Hibernian on 16 September 2012, Shiels expressed support of needing TV evidence to be shown and branded Hibernian's player Paul Cairney as a \"diver\". On 28 October 2012, Shiels led Kilmarnock to a historic win at Celtic Park against Celtic. The victory was Kilmarnock's first win in the East End of Glasgow for 57 years and led to prominent Killie fans claiming Shiels is the best thing to ever happen to Kilmarnock. After the match, Shiels praised Kelly, whose father died of a heart attack in March, for performance, making him [Shiels] pleased and also praised two of his youngster's for his performance. A week after a memorable win over Celtic, Shiels would report referee Euan Norris of making inappropriate comments, following a 2-1 default against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, which Norris would send-off Cammy Bell. His support even attracted FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, suggesting that SFA should hire Shiels. His remark also led to Shiels given a five-match touchline ban after disciplinary hearing with the SFA. Following this, Shiels then appealed against his decision, but will serve his touchline ban."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Scottish First Division", "response": ["| Paul Cairney"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["||| MF|| Paul Cairney", "|Paul Cairney"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["| Paul Cairney"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Scottish Premiership", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Paul Cairney"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football transfers summer 2014", "response": ["| FreeKilmarnock: Midfielder Paul Cairney signs two-year deal, BBC Sport."]}, {"page": "List of Partick Thistle F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Paul Cairney"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["| Paul Cairney"]}]}}
