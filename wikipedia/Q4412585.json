In addition, over-arching storylines covering several episodes or even series, provided sub-plots between main characters, allowing for character and relationship development between them, with additional characters added in over time; one particular addition was David Lonsdale, who was given a role in the cast under the character he portrayed in an earlier episode. Following Berry's departure from the programme during the seventh series, Heartbeat saw the cast receive changes throughout its history, taking over prominent roles focused on the three storyline themes it employed in episodes."]}, {"page": "King George V College", "response": ["* David Lonsdale, actor."]}, {"page": "Tricia Penrose", "response": ["Penrose's appearance as Carol the Barmaid in 1993's \u201cTerraces\u201d was followed by her longest running role as Gina Ward in  Heartbeat where she appeared in over 300 episodes between 1993 and the series final episode in 2010, making her the longest serving female cast member.
