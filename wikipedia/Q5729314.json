Trigg initially attended the first Anglican Church, where he was a choirmaster. He later joined the Wesleyans, but from 1843 he held prayer meetings in the Congregational tradition in his own home. In 1845 a number of the Congregationalists met to discuss the building of a chapel, and a \u00a33 subscription was agreed upon. Following this a site in William Street was obtained and on 6 September 1846 the first Congregational Chapel was opened. Within twelve months the building was enlarged to seat nearly 200 people. In the following six years, Trigg conducted all the services until, in 1852, the London Missionary Society sent out the Reverend James Leonard to be the first ordained Congregational minister. Leonard only stayed for three years before leaving the congregation in 1855. In 1858 the Congregational Church closed until the early 1860s, when Trigg set about reviving the cause. In October 1862 the Reverend James Innes became pastor of the Perth congregation.", "In October 1884, the congregation decided to build a commercial building on the Hay Street frontage of the property.

This was accepted and Trinity Church was dedicated in December 1893 and opened in 1894. The plans and specifications were prepared by Henry Trigg and the contractors were Bunning Brothers at a contract price of \u00a36,100. The design for the new church provided accommodation for 750 people on the ground floor and for 100 in the galleries. Additional funds of \u00a3500 were budgeted for furnishings, and \u00a3500 for an organ. The new building was designed for the minister's voice to be heard from every part of it. The church was to have been furnished with chairs, but owing to the slope in the floor, locally crafted pews were substituted. The foundation stone for Trinity Church was laid by Governor William Robson on 22 March 1893. Dr Bevan from the Collins Street Congregational Church, Melbourne came to Perth to conduct the opening services. The ceremony was attended by Sir John and Lady Forrest, Sir James Lee Steere, Alexander Forrest (Mayor of Perth) and a crowd of the leading citizens of Perth and Fremantle.

He gained a theoretical training at this office, and when his articles were completed he went to Sydney to practise for a couple of years. During his sojourn in the New South Wales capital he had the advantage of seeing some of the best architectural efforts in the Southern Hemisphere.
