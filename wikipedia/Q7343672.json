A new record for the most consecutive penalties scored in a shoot-out was set, at 25. McBreen was reported to have signed for North Queensland Fury of the A-League, although the transfer had yet to be confirmed by York. It was confirmed that he would join the Fury for the start of 2009\u201310 in August 2009. Former Wrexham defender Shaun Pejic signed after a successful trial at the club.
