The designers aimed the book at experienced players and DMs looking for something new, encouraging them to customize the game's rules. The designers did not want the third edition book to be like the original Unearthed Arcana mechanically, because according to Andy Collins: \"Every book on the market looks like the original Unearthed Arcana. New classes, new spells, new magic items - that's the default \"recipe\" for a d20 product these days. We saw no need to do that with this book.\" Where the original Unearthed Arcana had simply expanded the rules and options of the core game, this 224-page supplement was aimed at providing an extensive list of variant rules and options to change the standard game itself. The volume of options added was intentionally excessive; according to the designers, a Dungeon Master who reads the book must be prepared to \"Drink from the fire hose\" and to think before using options that may radically imbalance the game.Ryan, Michael (February 7, 2004).
