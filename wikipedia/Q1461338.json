He scored his first Football League goal to open the scoring 20 minutes into a 3\u20130 win against Walsall on 12 September: after his free kick was blocked, \"he recovered possession and fired in from a crowd of players, the ball twisting over the goal-line a second before Riley dashed up to make sure.\" He was rested for a couple of matches in mid-December, apart from which he was ever-present as Lincoln City led the table for much of the season before dropping to second place in the last three games. He continued ever-present until 9 January 1932, when he injured a leg during the second half of a match against Rochdale, and played on at outside left despite the pain. The leg was X-rayed afterwards and revealed a broken fibula. He returned to reserve-team football after two months out, and resumed first-team duties afer another month, playing the last five matches of the season as Lincoln won the Third Division North title and gained promotion to the Second Division. He was retained for 1932\u201333, and began the season in the league eleven. He missed two games in September after the taxi in which he and four team-mates were travelling to Swansea Town's ground was in collision with a bus, \"broken glass inflicting deep cuts immediately above and below the left eyelid. Four stitches [were] inserted in each wound.\" George Whyte took over the left-half position in December, and Buckley played just twice more that season. He was listed as open to transfer, and signed for Rochdale in July 1933."]}, {"page": "Whyte, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Whyte"]}]}}
