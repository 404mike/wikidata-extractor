He is best known for his work in the East Sussex coastal towns of Brighton and Hove (now part of the city of Brighton and Hove), where several of his eclectic range of residential, commercial and religious buildings have been awarded listed status by English Heritage. Working alone or (from 1881) in partnership with two sons as Lainson & Sons, he designed buildings in a wide range of styles, from Neo-Byzantine to High Victorian Gothic; his work is described as having a \"solid style, typical of the time\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital", "response": ["The hospital originally stood on Dyke Road in the Montpelier area of Brighton.  Local architect Thomas Lainson's red-brick and terracotta building, in the Queen Anne style, was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1881. It remained in use for more than a century before being replaced by a new building at the main Royal Sussex County Hospital site.  The new facility opened in June 2007, and has won architectural awards for its innovative design.", "Thomas Lainson, who entered practice in the early 1860s, was a prolific and eclectic local architect. By 1880, his works included residential terraces in the Italianate style, places of worship in diverse styles (Romanesque Revival and Neo-Byzantine), a High Gothic working men's club and an Italianate villa. His buildings often incorporated multicoloured brick and dressings of terracotta.  In about 1881, he went into partnership with two of his sons, Thomas J. and Arthur, who worked together as Lainson & Sons.", "Thomas Lainson's building of 1880\u201381 was in a Shavian interpretation of the Queen Anne style, which he and his sons used again in later buildings in the area (such as the Belgrave Hotel of 1882 and in their work on the Vallance Estate in Hove in the early 1890s). The three-storey building is mostly of red brick with some terracotta dressings. Lainson made extensive use of ornate decorative mouldings on the east-facing main fa\u00e7ade, which is not symmetrical and has a Dutch gable.  Another decorative feature was a cartouche which commemorated the Royal Family members present at the opening. The south-facing secondary fa\u00e7ade has conventional gables, large chimneys and a pair of cupola-topped turrets at one end. Another local firm, Clayton & Black, added a colonnade on this side in 1906.  In 1927, the north side was extended in a style which matched Lainson's work: W.H. Overton's design included gables with half-timbering and tile-hanging.  The 1904 extension, consisting of isolation facilities and outpatients' accommodation, was in the Vernacular/Domestic style with half-timbered gables with jettying, prominent mullions and transoms to the bay windows, and a small tower."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Thomas Lainson, architect"]}, {"page": "List of places of worship in Brighton and Hove", "response": ["|Thomas Lainson's Romanesque Revival church of 1873, built on a corner site on Bristol Road with a timber-framed roof and small spire, was closed in 1989 and converted into a recording studio.", "|Thomas Lainson's 1874 building in yellow and brown Sussex brick replaced an earlier synagogue on which David Mocatta had worked.  The 300-capacity building has an unusually opulent interior, partly funded by the Sassoon family, but high maintenance costs and the existence of three other synagogues in the city led to its closure in 2004."]}]}}
