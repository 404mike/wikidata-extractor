He was the son of Thomas Arnold, the celebrated headmaster of Rugby School, and brother to both Tom Arnold, literary professor, and William Delafield Arnold, novelist and colonial administrator.  Matthew Arnold has been characterised as a sage writer, a type of writer who chastises and instructs the reader on contemporary social issues.Landow, George.

He was also an inspector of schools for thirty-five years, and supported the concept of state-regulated secondary education."]}, {"page": "Wycliffe Hall, Oxford", "response": ["thumb|left|The original part of Wycliffe Hall - 54 Banbury Road, 'Laleham' The hall - No.54 Banbury Road was designed by John Gibbs in 1866 and built for Tom Arnold the younger, literary scholar and son of Tom Arnold the elder, head of Rugby School.  The house, named \"Laleham\", after the Arnolds' former residence in Middlesex, was larger than normal, even in a neighbourhood known for substantial houses. This size was to accommodate Arnold's anticipated in-house tutees.  Within a decade, Arnold decided to sell No.54 as the tutorial business was abandoned.  A committee of evangelical churchmen bought the property in 1877 and promptly renamed it Wycliffe Hall.  In the early years, the northerly main room was the library-cum-lecture room, while the southerly one was the dining room.  Additions were soon made to the house by William Wilkinson and Harry Wilkinson Moore in 1882\u20131883.  The new North Wing contained a dozen additional student rooms, while South Wing, housed the hall's purpose-built library as well as a new front entrance, thus allowing the dining room to be extended into the hall of No.54.  A new purpose-built dining hall was built on the road-side (i.e. west) of No.54 Banbury Road in 1913, blocking off both of the original main entrances to the hall (the 1866 and 1883 doors), but providing a new front door featuring the hall and university shields in the stonework doorframe, still visible today.  South Wing was converted for use as an additional common room (the LCR) in 1974, while the dining hall was converted for use as a lecture theatre in 1980."]}, {"page": "Mary Augusta Ward", "response": ["Mary Augusta Arnold was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, into a prominent intellectual family of writers and educationalists.Sutherland, John (1991).
