With his brother, Sealy, he commissioned the development of the Fourdrinier machine, a papermaking machine that produced continuous rolls of paper. The machine is an industrialised version of the historical hand paper-making method, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of printing and writing materials.\nA patent was granted on 24 July 1806, for a machine that could make a long continuous web of paper. This had the dual advantage of considerably higher productivity plus production in roll form, for applications such as wallpaper printing. The range of cut paper sizes was also extended as it was not limited by the frame or deckle size of hand made paper.\n\nThe invention cost \u00a360000, and caused the brothers to go bankrupt. Due to various laws, it was difficult to protect the patent on the machine, and the new system was widely adopted but with no benefit to the inventors.\nIn 1814, two machines were made in Peterhof, Russia, by order of the Russian emperor on the condition \u00a3700 would be paid to Fourdrinier every year for ten years \u2014 but, despite petitioning Tsar Nicholas, no money was ever paid. In 1839, a petition was brought before parliament, and in 1840, \u00a37000 was paid to Fourdrinier and his family.Fourdrinier died in 1854, at the age of 88.\nHis sister, Jemima, was the mother of the theologian John Henry Newman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Industrial Revolution", "response": ["A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for Saint-L\u00e9ger Didot family in France.

In 1808 Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier invented a process by which paper could be made in a continuous roll and it was at St Neots Mill (in Little Paxton) that the process was first put into action.
