He made his first radio broadcast for the BBC in 1932 and in 1937 and 1938 he featured in early television broadcasts.\nHe came to national fame when cast with the comedian Arthur Askey in the radio show Band Waggon in 1938. Their contrasting styles appealed to the public and they took a version of the show on tour to theatres around the country and made a film adaptation of it. Serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Murdoch met a fellow officer, Kenneth Horne, and together they conceived, wrote and starred in the radio series Much Binding in the Marsh, which ran from 1944 to 1954. Murdoch's last long-running radio programmes were The Men from the Ministry (1962\u20131977) in which he played a well-meaning but disaster-prone civil servant, and Many a Slip, a panel game that combined humour and erudition, in which he appeared from 1964 to 1973.\nMurdoch appeared on air and on stage in Australia, Canada and South Africa, and continued acting and broadcasting into his eighties.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Richard Murdoch (1907\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "Pembroke College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Richard Murdoch"]}, {"page": "Staines-upon-Thames", "response": ["* Richard Murdoch, comedian, after whom Murdoch Close in the town is named."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Horne", "response": ["The son of a clergyman who was also a politician, Horne had a burgeoning business career with Triplex Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.", "In March 1943 Horne was posted to the Air Ministry in London, with the rank of wing commander. Continuing to broadcast on Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer, he also began to write sketches for the programme, and make broadcasts on other shows, including the Overseas Recorded Broadcasting Service (ORBS), to be transmitted to British forces in the Middle East. His work with ORBS brought him into contact with Flight Lieutenant Richard Murdoch, who he jokingly introduced in one broadcast as \"the station commander of Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh\"; with a great deal in common in their backgrounds and a similar sense of humour, the pair quickly formed a friendship. Horne informed Murdoch of a squadron leader vacancy in his section at the Ministry, and Murdoch became his colleague. Murdoch, a professional actor and entertainer for 12 years before the war, recognised Horne's talent as a performer, and used his contacts to secure him more broadcasting work.", "! scope=\"row\" | Richard Murdoch and Kenneth Horne Talking it Over", "| with Richard Murdoch and Sam Costa", "| with Richard Murdoch", "| with Richard Murdoch"]}, {"page": "List of British comedians", "response": ["*Richard Murdoch (1907\u20131990), Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh"]}, {"page": "Deryck Guyler", "response": ["In the 1950s, he played the time-traveller (also known as \"the voice\") in the British sci-fi radio series Journey into Space.
