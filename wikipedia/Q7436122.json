He last played for Albion Rovers in their 2014\u201315 Scottish League Two winning season.\nChaplain began his career in the Rangers youth set-up before moving on to Ayr United in 2000. He made 91 starts and scored 11 goals in his 5 seasons at the club before being released and signing for Albion Rovers. In the 2006\u201307 season he scored 18 league goals and won the SPFA's player of the year award for the Third Division. At the end of the season, he was signed on a full-time contract by Partick Thistle manager Ian McCall.\nAfter leaving Partick Thistle in the summer of 2009, Chaplain was signed by Dumbarton. He rejoined Albion Rovers in January 2011, helping them win promotion to the Second Division. He scored the goal that got Rovers into the play-off final, and in that final against Stranraer he scored two goals as the club retained their place in the third tier.\nIn 2012, Chaplain left Albion Rovers to join Third Division side Annan Athletic but once again signed for Albion Rovers in May 2013. He was part of the Rovers team that reached the last eight of the 2013\u201314 Scottish Cup, and scored ten goals from midfield in the 2014\u201315 season, when Albion Rovers won the League Two title. Chaplain retired from football in June 2015, having been offered a position with the Scottish Football Association.He has also played for the Scotland national futsal team and became their coach in February 2018 and has led the side to three wins in four games, one of which gave the national side their first ever clean sheet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clyde F.C.", "response": ["The Clyde vs Partick Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the Old Firm. The rivalry intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at Firhill for five years in the 1980s. The decision to groundshare was never fully accepted by either set of fans. After quitting Clyde on free transfer to sign for the Firhill club (newly promoted to the SPL) in 2002, Jamie Mitchell stated he was shocked by the reaction of Clyde supporters to the move. He referred to it as getting the \"Mo Johnston treatment\". Former Jags midfielder Scott Chaplain (once a signing target for Clyde) spoke of the \"competitive edges to those particular matches\" after playing in the fixtures many times. When talking about a possible groundshare again, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry saying \"the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical\". Due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the Scottish Premiership, in the 2010s and Clyde's relegations to the lower leagues in the same period, matches between the two clubs became less common. However, by 2020 they found themselves in the same division (Scottish League One) once again, with a revived version of the Glasgow Cup also offering more meetings."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| Scott Chaplain ||  Ayr United || Free||"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Scottish Challenge Cup", "response": ["* Scott Chaplain \u2013 Albion Rovers"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["|Scott Chaplain||32||6||5||4||0", "|Scott Chaplain||5||0||0||0||5"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["|Scott Chaplain||13||16||2||2||0", "|Scott Chaplain||1||1||1||0||0", "|Scott Chaplain||1||2||1||0||0", "|Scott Chaplain||3||1||0||0||0", "|Scott Chaplain||5||1||0||0||0", "|Scott Chaplain||2||1||1||0||4"]}, {"page": "2002 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||16|| Scott Chaplain || || "]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Scott Chaplain"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Scottish Third Division", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Scott Chaplain"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Annan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["|||MF||Scott Chaplain", "| Scott Chaplain"]}, {"page": "PFA Scotland Team of the Year", "response": ["| MF || Scott Chaplain || Albion Rovers ||align=\"center\"|1"]}, {"page": "East Kilbride YM FC", "response": ["In August 2015,  Scott Chaplain was announced as the team's new player/coach after retiring from Senior football due to his new job within the SFA.", "* Head Coach: Scott Chaplain"]}]}}
