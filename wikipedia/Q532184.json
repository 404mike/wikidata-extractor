During his 65-year career, he appeared in dozens of stage performances and more than 40 film and television productions.\nShaw was born and brought up in Holt, Norfolk, and made his acting debut at age eight at a London theatre. He studied acting at Gresham's School and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Although he worked primarily on the London stage, he made his Broadway debut in 1929, when he played one of the two murderers in Rope's End. He appeared in his first film, Caste, in 1930 and quickly began to create a name for himself in films. He described himself as a \"rotten actor\" as a youth and said his success was primarily due to his good looks. He claimed to mature as a performer only after returning from service in the Royal Air Force during World War II.\nShaw was particularly known for his performances in productions of Shakespeare plays which were considered daring and ahead of their time. In 1966, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he remained for a decade and delivered some of his most acclaimed performances. He also wrote several poems and a novel, The Christening, in 1975. In 1983, he appeared in the third installment of the original Star Wars Trilogy, Return of the Jedi, in a brief but significant role as the redeemed Anakin Skywalker, as well as Skywalker's ghost in the original 1983 theatrical release of the film.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 29", "response": ["*1905 \u2013 Sebastian Shaw, English actor, director, and playwright (d. 1994)"]}, {"page": "Sebastian Shaw", "response": ["Sebastian Shaw is the name of:", "* Sebastian Shaw (actor) (1905\u20131994), English film and stage actor", "* Sebastian Shaw (comics), a character from the X-Men comic books by Marvel Comics", "* Sebastian Shaw (serial killer) (1967\u20132021), Vietnamese-born American serial killer", "* Sebastian Shaw, British TV actor on Coronation Street"]}, {"page": "1930s", "response": ["* Sebastian Shaw"]}, {"page": "1905", "response": ["* May 29 \u2013 Sebastian Shaw, English actor (d. 1994)"]}, {"page": "Cymbeline", "response": ["A decade later, John Barton's 1974 production for the RSC (with assistance from Clifford Williams) featured Sebastian Shaw in the title role, Tim Pigott-Smith as Posthumus, Ian Richardson as Iachimo, and Susan Fleetwood as Imogen.

When Shaw arrived at the set for filming, he ran into his friend Ian McDiarmid, the actor playing the Emperor. When McDiarmid asked him what he was doing there, Shaw responded, \"I don't know, dear boy, I think it's something to do with science-fiction.\" His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew, and Shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any film secrets with anyone, even his family. The unmasking scene, directed by Richard Marquand, was filmed in one day and required only a few takes, with no alteration from the original dialogue. Lucas personally directed Shaw for his appearance in the final scene of the film, in which he plays Anakin's Force spirit. Shaw's likeness in this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 DVD release. This attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together was one of the most controversial changes in a Star Wars re-release. Shaw received more fan mail and autograph requests from Return of the Jedi than he had for any role in the rest of his career.

The penumbrascope, a device for providing a background by means of shadows, which came into play for the first time in this production, was used so carelessly that its edges were often visible. The essence of stagecraft is illusion, which must not be shattered by such accidents. Caesar's ghost was also very unconvincing, nor did the handful of people listening to the funeral orations suggest an excited mob.\" Greater praise was given by the same paper to Felicity's First Season, broadcast in September 1938 and, unusually for the time, written directly for television. \"The play relies on dialogue throughout, and there is a skilful use of film to suggest the journey to Scotland.

Prowse spoke the dialogue during filming, but George Lucas wanted a \"darker voice\" than Prowse's relatively jovial West Country accent, and had James Earl Jones provide a more sinister, malevolent voice for the character. Prowse stated he was originally told he would be seen and heard at the end of Return of the Jedi when Vader's mask was removed. Instead, actor Sebastian Shaw was used.Pirani, Adam. \"Sebastian Shaw: The Return of Anakin Skywalker\", Starlog, July 1987, Vol. 11, Iss. 120, p. 56\u201357, 96. Upon Prowse's death, Lucas stated that:David brought a physicality to Darth Vader that was essential for the character. He made Vader leap off the page and on to the big screen, with an imposing stature and movement performance to match the intensity and undercurrent of Vader\u2019s presence. David was up for anything and contributed to the success of what would become a memorable, tragic figure.In the 2004 documentary Empire of Dreams, actress Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia in the original trilogy films, quipped that they nicknamed Prowse \"Darth Farmer\" (a jibe regarding his West Country accent). In the lightsaber fight scenes between Vader and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Prowse, who was not a very skilled swordsman and kept breaking the staffs used as the lightsabers, was replaced by the scene's fight choreographer, the stuntman and fencing coach Bob Anderson. Prowse felt sidelined by Anderson during the making of Return of the Jedi in particular, and said he was only able to persuade director Richard Marquand that he should be the one to throw the Emperor down the shaft after Marquand had tried and failed for a week to film the scene successfully without him."]}, {"page": "Changes in Star Wars re-releases", "response": ["In the scene where Anakin Skywalker is unmasked, the 2004 edition digitally removed his eyebrows to reflect Anakin burning on Mustafar at the end of Revenge of the Sith.

Hayden Christensen later played Anakin in the prequel trilogy films Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. To reflect this, the 2004 edition of Return of the Jedi replaced Shaw's appearance as the Force spirit with Christensen.
