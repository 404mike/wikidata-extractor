Her father was an outfitter who provided equipment to polar explorers, and her mother was a homemaker. Shakow was a 1948 graduate of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania and gained bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Oxford in 1950 (in two years, rather than three) and 1954 respectively. Tutored by both AJP Taylor and Isaiah Berlin, she asked the former to be her doctoral supervisor, but Taylor disapproved of the PhD, which he did not consider worthwhile. She received her doctorate in History from Harvard in 1957.Steiner specialised in foreign relations, international relations and 20th-century history of Europe and of the United States. Richard J. Evans described her two volumes in the Oxford History of Modern Europe (The Lights That Failed and The Triumph of the Dark) as the \"standard works\" on international diplomacy between both world wars.From 1968 to 1995, Steiner was a Fellow of New Hall (now Murray Edwards College) of the Cambridge University. In 2007, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the UK's national academy for the humanities and the social sciences.She married the literary critic and scholar George Steiner in 1955. He predeceased her by ten days. The couple were introduced by their respective Harvard professors who knew both of them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Triple Entente", "response": ["Britain, traditionally having control of the seas, by 1909 saw the German navy as a serious threat to its Royal Navy. Britain was well ahead in terms of Dreadnought technology and responded with a major building program. They built a Royal Navy that Germany could never rival. The British sent war minister Lord Haldane to Berlin in February 1912 to reduce friction stemming from the Anglo-German naval arms race.  The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a \"naval holiday\" with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where \"Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.\" Zara Steiner says, \"It would have meant abandoning the whole system of ententes which had been so carefully nurtured during the past six years. There was no German concession to counter the fear of German aggression.\"Zara S. Steiner, Britain and the origins of the First World War (1977) p 95. Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany, even if Germany did not start a war dooming the talks to failure.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers (2012) pp 318-19.John H. Maurer, \"The Anglo-German naval rivalry and informal arms control, 1912-1914.\" Journal of Conflict Resolution 36.2 (1992): 284-308.  According to German historian Dirk B\u00f6nker, \"To be sure, the [naval] race was decided early on; political leaders and diplomats learned to bracket it as an issue, and it did not cause the decision for war in 1914. But the naval competition nonetheless created an atmosphere of mutual hostility and distrust, which circumscribed the space for peaceful diplomacy and public recognition of shared interests, and helped to pave the twisted road to war in Europe.\""]}, {"page": "George Steiner", "response": ["After his doctoral thesis at Oxford, a draft of The Death of Tragedy (later published by Faber and Faber), was rejected, Steiner took time off from his studies to teach English at Williams College and to work as leader writer for the London-based weekly publication The Economist between 1952 and 1956. It was during this time that he met Zara Shakow, a New Yorker of Lithuanian descent. She had also studied at Harvard and they met in London at the suggestion of their former professors. \"The professors had had a bet ... that we would get married if we ever met.\" They married in 1955, the year he received his DPhil from Oxford University. They have a son, David Steiner (who served as New York State's Commissioner of Education from 2009 to 2011) and a daughter, Deborah Steiner (Professor of Classics at Columbia University).
