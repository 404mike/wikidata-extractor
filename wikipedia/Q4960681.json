Known to many friends as \"Lily\" or \"Lil\", O'Grady is publicly known for having had many high profile and celebrity friends, including the late politician Mo Mowlam, actresses Amanda Mealing and Barbara Windsor, comedian Brenda Gilhooly, and the late singer Cilla Black."]}, {"page": "Harry Hill's TV Burp", "response": ["Following a successful pilot broadcast on 22 December 2001, a series was commissioned, starting on 14 November 2002. Production of an episode often involved Hill and his programme's associate writing team, including Brenda Gilhooly, Paul Hawksbee, Daniel Maier, Joe Burnside, David Quantick and Madeleine Brettingham, watching significant amounts of television, much on preview tapes. Throughout Series 1 to 9, the show was recorded before a live audience in Studio 1 of Teddington Studios, South-West London, but from Series 10 to the final episode of Series 15, recording was relocated to BBC Television Centre in Studio 4. The first two series of the show were broadcast within a late night slot on Thursdays, with Series 1 being the only series not to feature clips from the BBC's EastEnders; Hill was required, during the series, to accompany his comments on the British soap with either crude animation, courtroom-style sketches or staged comic re-enactments of scenes from the show. Whilst the show was well received, the scheduling was criticised due to the family-friendly humour, leading to the third series receiving a teatime repeat slot on Sundays. Starting from the fourth series, the show moved to a Saturday teatime slot, and then later to a Saturday primetime slot."]}, {"page": "Gayle Tuesday", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brenda Gilhooly"]}, {"page": "Tuesday (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Gayle Tuesday, a pseudonym of Brenda Gilhooly (born 1964), an English comedian"]}, {"page": "Gilhooly", "response": ["* Brenda Gilhooly (born 1964), English comedian"]}, {"page": "Gilhooley", "response": ["* Brenda Gilhooly (born 1964), English comedian"]}, {"page": "Calendar Girls (play)", "response": ["*Brenda Gilhooly as Celia (withdrew during tour, replaced by Kathryn Rooney)"]}, {"page": "Inside No. 9", "response": ["At the 2018 Writers' Guild Awards, administered by the Writers' Guild of Great Britain, Shearsmith and Pemberton won the Best TV Situation Comedy award for their work on \"The Bill\".
