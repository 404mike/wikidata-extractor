G. Wells, and his books so familiar that people do not study them closely. In Rebellato's view, The Midwich Cuckoos was, on rereading, \"a searching novel of moral ambiguities where once I'd seen only an inventive but simple SF thriller\", a book that questioned the assumptions of its narrator character. It dealt, he argued, with the struggle between men and women at least as much as between people and aliens, touching on rape, abortion, childbirth and motherhood, with a subtext a great deal more subtle than the narrator's brusque story. Rebellato observed, too, that Wyndham was writing in the 1950s under the Lord Chamberlain's censorship for obscenity, so his use of \"misdirection, subtext, irony and ambiguity\" were necessary to allow publication of his discussion of sexuality. Rebellato addresses, too, the New Wave science fiction writer Brian Aldiss's criticism of Wyndham's books as \"cosy catastrophes\"; in his view, the stories may look like that, but they are \"surprisingly unheroic\" and often open-ended, while underneath they are \"very uncosy, persistently unsettling\", asking profound questions about the limits of Western culture.", "* 2003 radio production - An adaptation by Dan Rebellato in two 60-minute episodes for BBC Radio 4 was first broadcast between 30 November and 7 December 2003.

Tynan espoused a new theatrical realism, best exemplified in the works of the playwrights who became known as the \"Angry Young Men\". There was a significant development in the 1955\u201356 British theatre season during which John Osborne's Look Back in Anger (and Samuel Beckett's English version of his own Waiting for Godot) premiered. Tynan championed Osborne's play, although he identified some possible flaws, concluding his review with the comment: \"I doubt if I could love anyone who did not wish to see Look Back in Anger.

Chothia writes that \"the seeming triviality\" and rich, flippant characters of Coward's plays, though popular with the public, aroused hostility from a few, such as the playwright Sean O'Casey, \"perhaps particularly because of the ease with which his sexually charged writing seemed to elude censorship\".
