He joined the Royal Air Force as an engineering apprentice at the age of sixteen in 1962, becoming a British subject. He completed his training as an electrical fitter and in 1967 he was selected for officer and pilot training. He joined an operational squadron in 1971 flying Phantoms. He left the RAF in 1983 as a Squadron Leader and joined Cathay Pacific to fly Boeing 747s.During his apprenticeship he began gliding with the Royal Air Force Gliding & Soaring Association, winning his first British National Championship in 1974 in an ASW17. He was selected for the British Team for the World Gliding Championships at R\u00e4ysk\u00e4l\u00e4 in Finland in 1976 and won the Open Class in an ASW17. He then won the following two World Championships at Ch\u00e2teauroux in France 1978 (also in an ASW17) and at Paderborn in Germany 1981 in a Nimbus-3, becoming the first person to win three successive World Championship titles. He flew in two more World Championships but his home in Hong Kong had reduced his opportunities for gliding and so he was out of practice.He received several awards including the MBE, the Royal Aero Club's Gold Medal in 1976, the Britannia Trophy (twice) and the Lilienthal Gliding Medal. In 1978 he took Prince Charles for his first flight in a glider.He bought a farm near Dalby in Queensland in 1996 in anticipation of his retirement in 1999. He established a small airfield there and is now an Australian citizen. With his Schempp-Hirth Nimbus-4DM, he taught advanced pilots for ten years. He and his wife, Maren, are now active in their church and in politics in Queensland. They have two children, Sonja and Brian. He published his autobiography, Hold Fast To Your Dreams, in 2013,\nwhich was also published in Polish in 2015 as Uwierz w marzenia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dalby, Queensland", "response": ["*George Lee, gliding champion"]}, {"page": "Royal Aeronautical Society", "response": ["* 1977 - George Lee"]}, {"page": "World Gliding Championships", "response": ["|  George Lee", "|  George Lee", "|  George Lee"]}, {"page": "George Lee", "response": ["George Lee may refer to:", "* Sir George Lee (English politician) (c. 1700\u20131758), English politician", "* George Lee, 3rd Earl of Lichfield (1718\u20131772), British politician and peer", "* George Lee, Chinese British, Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Holborn & St Pancras", "* George Lee (Australian politician) (1834\u20131912), New South Wales pastoralist and politician", "* George Lee (journalist) (born 1962), Irish economist, journalist and former Fine Gael politician", "* George Lee (basketball) (born 1936), American former basketball player and coach", "* George Lee (cricketer, born 1854) (1854\u20131919), Yorkshire cricketer", "* George Lee (cricketer, born 1810) (1810\u20131894), English cricketer", "* George Lee (New Zealand cricketer) (1851-1931), New Zealand cricketer", "* George Lee (footballer) (1919\u20131991), English footballer", "* George Lee (pilot) (born 1946), winner of three World Gliding Championships", "* George Lee (athlete) (1886\u2013?), British track and field athlete", "* George Lee (American football) (1873\u20131927), American college football player and medical doctor", "* Sir George Lee, 6th Baronet (1767\u20131827) of the Lee baronets", "* George Lee (actor), British actor, in Spearhead from Space", "* George Lee, 2nd Earl of Lichfield (1690\u20131742)"]}, {"page": "List of glider pilots", "response": ["* George Lee - three time world champion, ex-RAF"]}, {"page": "Schleicher ASW 17", "response": ["ASW 17s came second in the World Gliding Championships in 1972, third in 1974.
