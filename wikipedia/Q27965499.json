The result of the referendum required a single majority vote of the United Kingdom and Gibraltar with no super majorities, no double majorities of the constituent countries, nor any minimum turnout threshold required for the vote to pass. The Act did not specify any specific consequences that would follow the result of the referendum. In the event of a \"Leave\" vote, it was expected that the government would decide whether, when, and under what circumstances, the UK would invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union to begin a two-year process of negotiations for Britain to leave the EU. Since the Act was also silent on the question of executive prerogative, the question of whether the government or Parliament was entitled to invoke Article 50 was the subject of court proceedings (Miller's case). James Eadie QC, acting for the government, submitted in his address to the court that, because the Act is silent, it would imply that Parliament chose not to limit prerogative powers in this matter."]}, {"page": "R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union", "response": ["In further submissions for the government, the lead claimant's primary argument was said by Treasury Counsel (James Eadie) to be that it is not open to the executive to use the prerogative power in such a way as to affect or change current economic law, principally statute law; but the government contended that the leading case Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel meant that the question about the use of the royal prerogative depended on Parliament's legislative intention.

On the first day of the hearing, which focused on the losers of each lower court case, the Advocate General for Scotland, Lord Keen, argued that the Government was entitled to prorogue Parliament for political purposes and the Court of Session ruled outside its jurisdiction. When asked by the court whether Johnson would prorogue Parliament for a second time, Keen did not answer. Lord Pannick , who responded on Miller's behalf, argued that there was \"strong evidence\" that the purpose of prorogation was to prevent MPs from \"frustrating\" the Government's Brexit plans, as opposed to a short prorogation for a Queen's Speech that the respondents \"had no quarrel with\". The second day focused on the victors in each lower court case; the Government, represented by James Eadie , argued that in the absence of legislation that regulated the power of prorogation, it was not appropriate for the judiciary to \"design a set of rules\" to judge prorogation by; O'Neill argued that although it would not be to appropriate to create such rules, it was nevertheless \"the province of the courts\" to decide whether prorogation was constitutional."]}, {"page": "R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland", "response": ["The second day heard from the victors in each lower court case; the government, represented by James Eadie, argued that prorogation was \"a well-established constitutional function exercised by the executive\" and that decisions about prorogation were matters of \"high policy\". Eadie argued that in the absence of legislation that regulated the power of prorogation, it was not appropriate for the judiciary to \"design a set of rules\" to judge prorogation by; when asked by the justices how prorogation was compatible with parliamentary sovereignty, he answered that prorogation always had the effect of temporarily suspending parliamentary scrutiny, and parliamentarians could continue scrutinising the government once Parliament resumed. Eadie was also questioned why there was no signed witness statement that testified to the reasons for prorogation. O'Neill, who represented the Cherry litigants, argued that the decision to prorogue was \"taken in bad faith\" and \"for an improper purpose\" and that the Court of Session opinion offered an outsider perspective \"400 miles from Westminster\" to that effect. O'Neill agreed with Eadie that it would not be appropriate for the Court to create such rules, but argued that it was nevertheless \"the province of the courts\" to decide whether prorogation was constitutional."]}, {"page": "Begum v Home Secretary", "response": ["The Supreme Court hearing took place on 23 and 24 November 2020.
