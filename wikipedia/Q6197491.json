Liverpool-Irish writer James Hanley wrote a number of works based on his experiences at sea as well as a member of a working-class seafaring family. An early example is the novella The Last Voyage (1931), in which stoker John Reilly, who is still working only because he lied about his age, now faces his last voyage.Stokes, p. 90. Although Reilly is in his mid-sixties he has a young family, who will have to live in future on his inadequate pension.Stokes, p. 16. In another sense this is Reilly's last voyage, because despairing of the future he throws himself into the ship's furnace: \u201cSaw all his life illuminated in those flames. \u2018Not much for us.
