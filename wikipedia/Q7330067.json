Wolfson was also a performance artist, cameraman and journalist, and had previously worked with Saunders in several groups. Wolfson and Saunders, both of European-Jewish descent, formed Towering Inferno in 1985 as an \"ambient, techno and heavy metal\" multimedia stage project that involved electronics and film. The duo toured Europe, augmenting their performances with slide and super 8 projectors. In 1986 they met Hungarian performance poet Endre Szk\u00e1rosi in Italy at the Bologna Festival and were impressed by his cryptic works which challenged Communist dictatorship and explored European identity. Wolfson and Saunders decided to explore their own identities and spent the next five years on the road filming, performing and creating what became Kaddish, named for the Jewish prayer of the same name. ", "In a Richard Wolfson obituary, The Daily Telegraph said that Towering Inferno was \"one of the most original and provocative performance-art bands of the 1990s\", and described Kaddish as \"a shocking and unforgettable piece\". In another Wolfson obituary, The Guardian called the work \"a complex and disturbing meditation on the Shoah that makes Steve Reich's Different Trains seem simplistic in comparison\". Richie Unterberger writing in AllMusic said that Kaddish, which \"reflects the horrors and wounds of the Holocaust with subtle (and largely wordless) complexity\", is \"not for everyone\", but added that \"[a]dventurous listeners will find much to chew on for repeated listenings\". Sound on Sound said that Kaddish \"not only satisfies on a musical level, but comes through with a sound of its own\". Trouser Press wrote: \"Such a violently engaging work, so heavily dependent upon visuals and the visceral impact of live amplitude to make its impact felt, would seem doomed if abstracted into a single dimension, yet the transformation from performance piece to record album is thoroughly successful\".", "All tracks composed by Richard Wolfson, Andy Saunders, M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n and Endre Szk\u00e1rosi, except where noted.", "*Richard Wolfson \u2013 composer, guitars, keyboards, programming, mandolin (track 9), bass guitar (track 18), drums and percussion (tracks 9, 20)"]}]}}
