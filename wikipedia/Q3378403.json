It soon became clear that the Ottoman Turkish Army was being mobilised and in August the Indian Government was instructed to prepare contingency plans to protect these strategic assets. The plans dictated that in the event of the Turkish Army coming out in support of the Germans, the Indian Army was to act to secure the oilfields. As a contingency, the Indian Expeditionary Force D (see below) under command of Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Barrett sailed from Bombay on 16 October 1914 for Bahrain.Ford, pp.23\u201324 They, together with Expeditionary Force A who had been hurriedly sent to Europe at the end of September in response to a request from the Imperial General Staff for men to support the war effort\u2014 became the first Indian elements committed to war outside of India."]}, {"page": "1919 in Afghanistan", "response": ["Amanullah launches what becomes known as the Third Anglo-Afghan War. A large Afghan army comes pouring across the Indian frontier and proceeds to pillage far and wide in the northwest provinces. Within a few days, and before the Afghans have suffered any serious defeats, the amir enters into tentative negotiations with the Indian government. The fighting continues, however, the British forces on the frontier being commanded by Gen. Sir Arthur Barrett. The aeroplanes attached to the Anglo-Indian forces bomb both Jalalabad and Kabul. After much procrastination a peace conference is opened at Rawalpindi on July 26, Sir Hamilton Grant representing the Indian government and Sardar Ali Ahmad Khan representing the amir. A preliminary peace (the Treaty of Rawalpindi) is signed on August 8. By the terms of the agreement the arrears of the late amirs subsidy are confiscated, and no subsidy is to be paid at present to the new amir. The Afghan privilege of importing arms and ammunition from India is also withdrawn. The frontier in the region of the Khyber is to be definitely demarcated by the Indian government, and the Afghans are to accept this demarcation. The Indian government expresses its willingness, however, to receive another Afghan mission six months later. Moreover, there is another item in the agreement which is subsequently made known and which evokes considerable criticism in England. In the past there was an agreement between Britain and Afghanistan that Afghanistan should have no relations with any foreign government except Britain. According to the new treaty this stipulation is withdrawn, the amirs government thus obtaining full liberty to enter into relations with any foreign government. It is regarded by many as a sinister comment on this agreement that during the year the amir sends a mission to Moscow."]}, {"page": "Arthur Barrett", "response": ["Arthur Barrett may refer to:", "* Sir Arthur Barrett (Indian Army officer) (1857\u20131926), British Indian Army Field Marshal", "* Arthur Barrett (cricketer) (1944\u20132018), Jamaican legspinner", "* Arthur Barrett (footballer) (1927\u20132011), English footballer for Tranmere Rovers", "* Arthur Barrett (Dean) (born 1960), Anglican priest"]}, {"page": "Sir Arthur Arnold Barrett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Barrett (Indian Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Sir Arthur Barrett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Barrett (Indian Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Arthur Arnold Barrett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Barrett (Indian Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Arthur Barrett (field marshal)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Barrett (Indian Army officer)"]}, {"page": "6th (Poona) Division", "response": ["*1912-1915: Major-General Sir Arthur Barrett KCB KCVO"]}, {"page": "Arthur Arnold Barret", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Barrett (Indian Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Field marshal (United Kingdom)", "response": ["| 100px|alt=Arthur Barrett"]}, {"page": "List of British Army full generals", "response": ["| Sir Arthur Barrett"]}, {"page": "Adjutant-General (India)", "response": ["| Sir Arthur Barrett"]}]}}
