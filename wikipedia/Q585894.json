Noted for his consistency, Westwood is one of the few golfers who has won tournaments on five continents \u2013 Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Oceania \u2013 including victories on the European Tour and the PGA Tour. Westwood has also won tournaments in four decades, the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. Westwood was named European Tour Golfer of the Year for the 1998, 2000, 2009 and 2020 seasons. He has won the 2000 European Tour Order of Merit, and the renamed 2009 and 2020 Race to Dubai. Westwood has frequently been mentioned as one of the best golfers without a major championship victory, despite several near misses including three runner-up finishes.He has represented Europe in ten Ryder Cups. In October 2010, Westwood became the World number one golfer, ending the reign of Tiger Woods, and becoming the first British golfer since Nick Faldo in 1994 to hold that position. He held the number one position for a total of 22 weeks. Westwood and fellow countryman Luke Donald share the distinction of reaching the number one world ranking despite never winning a major. After the 2021 Open Championship he held the record, that he previously shared with Jay Haas, of playing in the most major championships (88) without winning one.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 24", "response": ["*  1973   \u2013 Lee Westwood, English golfer"]}, {"page": "1973", "response": ["** Lee Westwood, English golfer"]}, {"page": "Tiger Woods", "response": ["Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S. Open as a result of an elbow injury that he sustained at The Players Championship.

Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history.
