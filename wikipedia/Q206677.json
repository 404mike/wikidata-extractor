The injunction was lifted a week later, and the British media \u2013 especially the tabloid press \u2013 covered the rumours in great detail in the days following. The News of the World and the Mail on Sunday subsequently printed apologies to Perroncel for breaching her privacy and stated that the story was \"untrue in any case\". Perroncel maintains that the alleged affair never took place. The allegations led to then-England manager Fabio Capello removing Terry from the captaincy on 5 February 2010, replacing him with Rio Ferdinand. Terry was reinstated as captain the following year."]}, {"page": "Wycombe Wanderers F.C.", "response": ["Paul Lambert took over in June, and took the club on another ambitious cup run, this time to the semi-finals of the Carling Cup. Having previously never passed the second round, Wycombe defeated Fulham away, and knocked out then Premier League side Charlton Athletic in the quarter-finals. This bought them to a semi-final with reigning Premier League champions Chelsea. The Wanderers drew the first leg 1\u20131 at Adams Park, with Jermaine Easter scoring a late equaliser after a first half goal from Wayne Bridge. The second leg at Stamford Bridge was a different story, as doubles from both Andriy Shevchenko and Frank Lampard saw Wycombe lose 4-0 and exit the competition. Again, however, the side's league form would suffer, and a number of changes were made to the squad and staff in the summer of 2007. They reached the League Two play-offs in 2008 but were knocked out 2\u20131 on aggregate by Stockport County. Lambert resigned shortly afterwards."]}, {"page": "Robert Pires", "response": ["He went on to be a crucial part of Arsenal's quest for the Premier League title in the 2003\u201304 season, which they achieved, remaining unbeaten and becoming the first English top flight club to do so in 115 years. Pires and his Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry were instrumental in that season, scoring a combined 57 goals in all competitions. Pires made a sluggish start to the campaign, with just one goal to his name (against Everton) prior to October, but a wonder-goal against Liverpool at Anfield kick-started his season. Pires showed football fans his sublime technique, skills and finishing, most notably with his goals against Liverpool, Bolton Wanderers, and Leeds United. He surprised a lot of people with a world class tackle on Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 and, following that, a run into the penalty box which dragged William Gallas and John Terry away, thus making space for Patrick Vieira to have a one-on-one with the Chelsea goalkeeper and subsequently scoring. Arsenal won that match 2\u20131, with Vieira's goal the equaliser. That day of Premier League action proved decisive, as Manchester United's failure to beat Leeds United during the same day resulted in Arsenal getting a huge lead in the title race. Arsenal never lost 1st place in the table for the rest of the season. In the UEFA Champions League quarter-final's 1st leg match against Chelsea, Pires managed to beat John Terry to a header, which resulted in the equaliser for Arsenal, after Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen had given Chelsea the lead. However, Arsenal were eliminated after they lost 1\u20132 in the return leg, courtesy of an 87th minute Wayne Bridge goal. Pires also scored home and away against Tottenham Hotspur. He showed his playmaking skills in a goal against Tottenham at White Hart Lane, in which Pires was the architect in building up the goal, and capped off the move with a goal to score Arsenal's 2nd goal of the game. Tottenham refused to give up, and managed to claw their way back and claimed a 2\u20132 draw. Despite that, Arsenal won the title after the match. Pires finished that season with an impressive tally of 14 goals and seven assists in the Premier League. He was Arsenal's second top scorer (behind Thierry Henry) and had the joint amount of assists (along with Dennis Bergkamp) that season."]}, {"page": "S Club 8", "response": ["*Frankie Bridge (born 14 January 1989,  years old) was the second oldest member of S Club 8 and was the group's more prominent singer.

In 2007 Sandford added two tracks to a MySpace music page, called Bored and Swallow.

Hughes stated, \"I'm sure Craig will be excellent for us, I think people will soon see why I wanted to bring him to the club\". This took his career-total transfer fees to \u00a347m. Bellamy arrived as part of Manchester City's increased spending following the investment of the Abu Dhabi United Group; Wayne Bridge, Nigel de Jong and Shay Given also arrived within a week. Bellamy marked his debut for Manchester City on 28 January by scoring the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win against Newcastle United at the City of Manchester Stadium. He scored again against Middlesbrough in the Premier League in a 1\u20130 win for City; it was his third appearance before scoring twice against FC Copenhagen in the UEFA Cup two weeks later. Despite investment, the side lacked consistency in the league, which Bellamy attributed to a \"clique\" of Brazilian players who had arrived at the club; Robinho, Elano and Gl\u00e1uber, with all of whom Bellamy clashed on several occasions. He argued with the group on more than one occasion and accused them of lacking effort following a 2\u20130 defeat against Portsmouth on 14 February 2009.

Days after the takeover, Abramovich was spotted meeting with England national team manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. Although the club denied Eriksson would be taking over at the time, these rumours would haunt Ranieri's season. Ranieri spent \u00a3120\u00a0million on players in the summer of 2003. These signings included Irish winger Damien Duff for a then club record \u00a317\u00a0million; English youngsters Wayne Bridge, Joe Cole and Glen Johnson; Argentine pair Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n and Hern\u00e1n Crespo; Frenchman Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9; and Romanian star Adrian Mutu. This investment resulted in the best league placing for the club in 49 years, as they finished runners-up in the Premier League to Arsenal, who had become the first side in over 100 years to go an entire league season unbeaten. This position automatically qualified Chelsea for the Champions League. The club also reached the semi-finals of the Champions League; Chelsea eliminated Arsenal en route, although Ranieri's position was weakened by the semi-final loss to Monaco, a reverse the manager himself was blamed for due to several bizarre substitutions and tactical changes.", "That season saw Chelsea break club records for the fewest goals conceded and highest number of points in a season. Former English footballer and pundit David Platt used the example of Ranieri to illustrate his observation that \"building a team that can win the title and actually steering this team to the title are two different matters entirely\". On 31 May 2004, after almost one year of speculation, which included the club's well-publicized courting of Eriksson, he was finally relieved of his coaching duties at Chelsea, and his job went to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who had led Porto to successive European triumphs. In Ranieri's four seasons, Chelsea improved their points total season on season. The core of the Chelsea team which won two Premier League titles under Mourinho, including John Terry, William Gallas, Wayne Bridge, Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 and Frank Lampard were all brought to Chelsea or nurtured by Ranieri. During his final months at Chelsea, Ranieri also identified Didier Drogba, Petr \u010cech and Arjen Robben as players Chelsea should sign, all of whom went on to become key players at the club."]}, {"page": "Darius Vassell", "response": ["Vassell made his England debut on 13 February 2002, in a man of the match performance against Netherlands in a 1\u20131 draw.

However, Cole scored his first Chelsea goal in Chelsea's very next game, on 1 March 2008, the fourth goal in a 4\u20130 away victory against West Ham United. On 19 March 2008, Cole was involved in a controversial incident in a Premier League game against Tottenham at White Hart Lane where he performed a high tackle on Tottenham's Alan Hutton.

Cole allegedly also \"turned his back on the referee\" and the episode renewed debate in the media over the game's rules on dissent towards officials."]}]}}
