She described this as \"a mess-table and comfortable quarters for sick and convalescent officers\", and provided succour for wounded service men on the battlefield, and nursed many of them back to health. She had met the most famous nurse in history Florence Nightingale for 5 minutes during the Crimean War. Coming from a tradition of Jamaican and West African \"doctresses\", Seacole displayed \"compassion, skills and bravery while nursing soldiers during the Crimean War\", through the use of herbal remedies. She was posthumously awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 1991. In 2004, she was voted the greatest black Briton.Mary Seacole relied on her skill and experience as a healer and a female doctor from Jamaica. Schools of nursing in England were only set up after the Crimean war, the first being the Florence Nightingale Training School, in 1860 at St Thomas' Hospital in London. Seacole was arguably the first nurse practitioner.Hoping to assist with nursing the wounded on the outbreak of the Crimean War, Seacole applied to the War Office to be included among the nursing contingent but was refused, so she travelled independently and set up her hotel and tended to the battlefield wounded. She became popular among service personnel, who raised money for her when she faced destitution after the war.\nIn 1858 a four-day Fundraising Gala took place on the banks of the river Thames, to honour Mary Seacole. Crowds of about 80,000 attended, including veterans, their families and Royalty.\nAfter her death she was largely forgotten for almost a century, but was subsequently recognised for her success as a woman. Her autobiography, Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands (1857), is one of the earliest autobiographies of a mixed-race woman, although some aspects of its accuracy have been questioned by present-day supporters of Florence Nightingale. The erection of a statue of her at St Thomas' Hospital, London, on 30 June 2016, describing her as a \"pioneer\", has generated controversy and opposition from Nightingale enthusiasts, such as Lynn McDonald, and others researching the period..[17-20]", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 14", "response": ["*1881 \u2013 Mary Seacole, Jamaican-English nurse and author (b. 1805)"]}, {"page": "Crimean War", "response": ["As the memory of the \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" demonstrates, the war became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and mismanagement. Public opinion in Britain was outraged at the logistical and command failures of the war; the newspapers demanded drastic reforms, and parliamentary investigations demonstrated the multiple failures of the Army. The reform campaign was not well organised, and the traditional aristocratic leadership of the Army pulled itself together, and blocked all serious reforms. No one was punished. The outbreak of the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857 shifted attention to the heroic defence of British interest by the army, and further talk of reform went nowhere.Peter Burroughs, \"An Unreformed Army? 1815\u20131868,\" in David Chandler, ed., The Oxford History of the British Army (1996), pp. 183\u201384 The demand for professionalisation was achieved by Florence Nightingale, who gained worldwide attention for pioneering and publicising modern nursing while treating the wounded. Another nurse, Jamaican doctress Mary Seacole, also made an impact providing care for wounded and dying soldiers. The Times war correspondent William Howard Russell spoke highly of Seacole's skill as a healer, writing \"A more tender or skilful hand about a wound or a broken limb could not be found among our best surgeons.\"\"Mary Seacole, by Jane Robinson\", Independent', 21 January 2005 https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/mary-seacole-by-jane-robinson-748262.html Retrieved 28 October 2020."]}, {"page": "Florence Nightingale", "response": ["According to some secondary sources, Nightingale had a frosty relationship with her fellow nurse Mary Seacole, who ran a hotel/hospital for officers.

However, Seacole pointed out that when she tried to join Nightingale's group, one of Nightingale's colleagues rebuffed her, and Seacole inferred that racism was at the root of that rebuttal.Mary Seacole, Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands, Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73\u201381 Nightingale told her brother-in-law, in a private letter, that she was worried about contact between her work and Seacole's business, claiming that while \u201cshe was very kind to the men and, what is more, to the Officers \u2013 and did some good (she) made many drunk\u201d.letter 4\u00a0August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/59).
