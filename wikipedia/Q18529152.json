A charge of indecency against her and Sir Leo Chiozza Money was dismissed by magistrates, but she was later detained again and subjected to a five-hour interrogation by male officers. Her complaints led to a public inquiry concerning police procedures and later a royal commission.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Patrick Hastings", "response": ["In 1928, Hastings became involved in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, economist and former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Irene Savidge were sitting in Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street Police Court. At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to establish some kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to report at once to Scotland Yard to avoid having to charge the defendants immediately.Hyde (1960) p. 176"]}, {"page": "William Horwood (police commissioner)", "response": ["From 1923, many newspapers started to run increasing numbers of stories about police misconduct and corruption. Horwood failed to act, refusing to respond to allegations or investigate his force's activities, and dismissing the stories as gossip and scandal-mongering. This culminated in 1928, with the scandal involving Sir Leo Money and Irene Savidge, in which the police were accused of perjury and harassment. Horwood again failed to handle the case, which was saved by the efforts of Chief Constable Frederick Wensley of the Criminal Investigation Department, and retired later the same year on 7 November 1928. Although he had in fact been scheduled to retire at that time (two days before his sixtieth birthday), it appeared to the public that he was leaving in disgrace and did him no favours. His reputation was further tarnished after Station Sergeant George Goddard of \"C\" Division was found guilty of taking bribes, confirming what many believed about the force's honesty and integrity."]}, {"page": "Leo Chiozza Money", "response": ["Sir Leo George Chiozza Money (;The Pronunciation of 10,000 Proper Names 13 June 1870 \u2013 25 September 1944), born Leone Giorgio Chiozza, was an Italian-born economic theorist who moved to Britain in the 1890s,Richard Toye (2007) Lloyd George and Churchill where he made his name as a politician, journalist and author. In the early years of the 20th century his views attracted the interest of two future Prime Ministers, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. After a spell as Lloyd George's parliamentary private secretary, he was a Government minister in the latter stages of the First World War. In later life the police's handling of a case in which he and factory worker Irene Savidge were acquitted of indecent behaviour aroused much political and public interest. A few years later he was convicted of an offence involving another woman.", "On the evening of St. George's Day, 23 April 1928, Money was in Hyde Park with Irene Savidge, a radio valve-tester from New Southgate in North London.William Donaldson (2002) Brewer's Rogues, Villains & Eccentrics; Taylor, 1965, Note B to Chapter VII Savidge was engaged to be married. A police constable spotted the exchange of what a later social historian has described as \"a rather chaste kiss\",Martin Pugh (2008) We Danced All Night: A Social History of Britain Between the Wars but the police said that mutual masturbation was taking place although Money claimed that he had been offering Savidge advice on her career.Taylor, 1965 They were both arrested and charged with indecent behaviour, but the case was dismissed by the Marlborough Street magistrate, who awarded costs of \u00a310 against the police.Donaldson, 2002; Time, 14 May 1928"]}, {"page": "Lilian Wyles", "response": ["Greater respect came in 1928, after the part she took in a case involving alleged sexual misconduct by Leo Chiozza Money and Irene Savidge, despite being initially spurned by Chief Inspector Alfred Collins, who was in charge of the case.Biography of Wyles on the Rhode Island College site (Russell A. Potter) Retrieved 25 October 2015."]}, {"page": "Archibald Bodkin", "response": ["His time as DPP was not without controversy. In 1924 he began the prosecution of John Campbell, acting editor of Workers' Weekly, using the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797. The collapse of the case led to the fall of the first Labour government to have held office in the United Kingdom since it was seen as evidence of communist influence on Labour Party politicians. Fortunately for Bodkin, the Attorney-General, Sir Patrick Hastings, took responsibility for the failure of the case. However, the events of 1928 were entirely of Bodkin's making. The affair began with the acquittal in the Magistrates' Court of Sir Leo Chiozza Money and Irene Savidge on charges of indecent behaviour. This led to an investigation into possible perjury charges against the police officers who had arrested them. However, the investigation, led by Bodkin, turned into more of a re-examination of Money and Savidge, and he was particularly criticised for a lengthy interrogation of Savidge at New Scotland Yard on 15 May 1928. Questions were asked in parliament, and although both the police and Bodkin were exonerated by the Home Secretary, the case raised important questions about the extent of the roles of police and the DPP."]}]}}
