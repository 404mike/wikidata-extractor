He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm offbreak bowler who played for Derbyshire between 1972 and 1977.\nHaving represented the Second XI since 1968, Swindell made his County Championship debut in 1972 in a draw against Surrey. Economical with the ball, he did not make a batting contribution throughout the match. He played extensively throughout the 1972 season which saw Derbyshire rooted to the foot of the Championship table, though he was to play against a team of West Indians early in the following season.\nHe played little throughout the following five seasons and finished his first-class career with an expensive bowling return and little to show from his batting against an in-form Gloucestershire side. Swindell was part of the Derbyshire tailending attack along with teammate Mike Hendrick during the early 1970s.\nSwindell played with the Second XI until 1978 and exited the game that summer, though he played one match with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swindell", "response": ["*Robert Swindell (born 1950), English retired cricketer", "*Robert Swindells, British children's writer"]}, {"page": "Swindell, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Swindell"]}]}}
