Cecil John Cadoux thought a date in the time of Suppiluliuma I or his son Mursili II (i.e. 14th century BC) was probable.", "Cecil John Cadoux: Ancient Smyrna. A history of the city from the earliest times to 324 A.D. Blackwell, Oxford 1938, pp. 25-26. Helmuth Theodor Bossert read the leftmost inscription (Akp\u0131nar 1) as \"Prince Kuwalanamuwa\", the same name which is found on the Hanyeri relief and \u0130mamkullu relief, but it is unclear whether all the three refer to the same individual. If they do, the prince under discussion must have been extremely influential, as there are no other individuals, except for Hittite kings, whose reliefs accompanied by hieroglyphic inscriptions are found in three distinct locations in Asia Minor. According to Ilya Yakubovich \"The Lydian Dating Formulae\", Luwic Dialects and Anatolian: Inheritance and Diffusion, ed. I. Adiego et al. [Universitat de Barcelona, 2019], p. 312, the Lydian noun qa\u03bbm(\u03bb)u- 'king' may ultimately go back to the name of this prince. The right inscription (Akp\u0131nar 2) was not legible to Hans Gustav G\u00fcterbock, who studied the relief with R.A. Alexander in 1978.Horst Ehringhaus: G\u00f6tter, Herrscher, Inschriften. 2005, p. 87."]}]}}
