He went to London in 1824, and entered the studio of Edward Goodall, with whom he remained a year. He engraved some of the subjects for Brockedon's Passes of the Alps, Captain Batty's Saxony, Turner's England and Wales and English Rivers, and numerous plates for The Art Journal, after Turner, Stanfield, Callcott, Herring, and others. His most important engravings on a large scale were Turner's \"Crossing the Brook\", \"The Snow-storm\", and \"The Bay of Baiae\". He also published two volumes of etchings, chiefly landscapes, after his own designs. He occasionally exhibited small oil pictures at the British Institution, which were distinguished by a good feeling for nature and a healthy tone of colour. The watercolour \"Rocks at Hastings\" is in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nHis brother John Brandard was a lithograph artist who designed many illustrated title-pages for music. His younger brother, Edward Paxman Brandard (1819\u20131898) was apprenticed to him while in Islington, London. Several plates by Edward also appeared in The Art Journal between 1853\u201387. Another engraver who studied with Robert Brandard was Joseph Clayton Bentley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Stothard", "response": ["*  An engraving by Robert Brandard of a painting by Stothard made for The Bijou annual for 1828 with illustrative verse by Letitia Elizabeth Landon."]}, {"page": "John Brandard", "response": ["John Brandard was the second of three sons born to Thomas Brandard (d. 1830), engraver and copperplate printer, of Barford Street, Deritend, Birmingham, and his wife, Ann.
