Among other things, the use of iron in ship construction enabled larger vessels to be built, and between 1836 and 1851 Chatham gained five new covered slipways, much larger in scale than the ones they replaced. (The covering of Chatham's slipways and dry docks, to protect the woodwork of ships as they were built or repaired, had begun with No 2 Slip and No 1 Dock in 1817)."]}, {"page": "HMNB Portsmouth", "response": ["In 1800, the Royal Navy had 684 ships and the Dockyard was the largest industrial complex in the world.
