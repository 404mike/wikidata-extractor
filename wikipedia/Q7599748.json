When its short career was run, he helped to found in 1827 the ultra Tory Standard, a newspaper that he edited along with a fellow graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, Stanley Lees Giffard; he also wrote for the more scandalous Sunday paper, The Age. In 1830 he instigated and became one of the leading supporters of Fraser's Magazine. His Homeric Ballads, much praised by contemporary critics,E.g., Matthew Arnold, On Translating Homer. were published in Fraser's between 1839 and 1842. In 1837, Bentley's Miscellany was launched, with Charles Dickens as editor, and Maginn wrote the prologue and contributed over the next several years a series of \"Shakespeare Papers\" that examined characters in counter-intuitive fashion (e.g., the key to Falstaff is his melancholy). From \"The Man in the Bell\" (Blackwood's, 1821) through \"Welch Rabbits\" (Bentley's, 1842) he was an occasional though skilful writer of short fiction and tales. His only novel, \"Whitehall\" (1827) pretends to be an historical novel set in 1820s England written in the year 2227; it is a droll spoof of the vogue for historical novels as well as the contemporary political scene."]}, {"page": "Alaric Alexander Watts", "response": ["In 1827 he assisted in founding the Standard as a sub-editor, while the first editor was Stanley Lees Giffard; and in 1833 he started the United Service Gazette, which he edited for 8 years.
