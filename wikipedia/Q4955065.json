At international level he has represented England C. He later moved on to Alfreton before joining Lincoln City. He was part of the Imps side that won the National League and reached the FA Cup quarter final during the 2016\u201317 season. He is currently serving a six-year ban from all football activity, expiring on 8 March 2024, for match fixing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["|2011|| Alan Connell || Bradley Wood"]}, {"page": "Robbie Stockdale", "response": ["Stockdale signed a two-year deal with Grimsby Town under Alan Buckley in June 2008 and was the first new signing for The Mariners in for the 2008\u20132009 campaign. He made his debut on 19 July in a pre-season friendly against Oldham Athletic at Blundell Park, and went on to score his first goal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Morecambe in the FA Cup. By this time Grimsby were under new stewardship following the sacking of Buckley in September 2008, with the club bringing in Mike Newell as his replacement. Following an injury spell in mid season, Stockdale remained on the sidelines for several months while his position was covered by Jamie Clarke. He managed a return to the first team in the closing months of the season and cemented his place at right back, eventually helping The Mariners stave off the threat of relegation from the Football League. During the 2009\u20132010 season Stockdale suffered a hernia injury that kept him sidelined again for several months and would only see him compete 9 times during that season in which right sided attacking midfielder Peter Bore was deployed as the club's first choice right back which would eventually see him be awarded the \"Fans Player of the Season\". Grimsby suffered relegation from the Football League in May 2010 and a month later Stockdale signed a new contract to keep him at Blundell Park for a further season but in the contract was the introduction of Stockdale as the new youth team manager as well as continuing to make himself available for selection as a player. Grimsby manager Neil Woods handed Stockdale the number 39 shirt for the 2010\u20132011 Conference National season as cover for Bore and Bradley Wood. On 18 January 2011 Stockdale played his first competitive match in 18 months when he was called upon to start in the 2\u20131 home win over Kettering Town, the game would be his final competitive match.", "In June 2010 Stockdale signed a new deal with The Mariners, where he also became the club's youth team manager as well as staying on as a player. The club had not appointed a new youth team boss since promoting Neil Woods to first team manager following the sacking of Mike Newell in November 2009. Stockdale was kept on the playing records as well for the 2010\u201311 season and was handed a squad number to be used as cover for Peter Bore, Bradley Wood and Dwayne Samuels who were the club's other contracted players who are capable of playing in Stockdale's position."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|29||  Bradley Wood || Grimsby Town Youth Academy || 18 || Pro Contract"]}, {"page": "Bradley Wood (disambiguation)", "response": ["Bradley Wood (born 1991) is an English footballer.", "Bradley Wood may also refer to:", "* Bradley Wood West Yorkshire, the base of and county camp-site for West Yorkshire County Scouts", "* Bradley Woods, an area of woodland in Wiltshire"]}]}}
