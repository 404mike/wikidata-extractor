He stood for the party in Mid Ulster at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election, taking 4,454 first-preference votes, but narrowly missed election.In the late 1970s, Sayers left the DUP and became active in the paramilitary Ulster Defence Association (UDA).  He was quickly appointed Brigadier of its Mid Ulster Brigade.  He stood for election to Omagh District Council in 1981, as an independent unionist, but came bottom of the poll, with only 74 votes.   He also ran Borderline Security, which acted as a front for the UDA. Within the UDA he became noted as a close comrade of overall leader Andy Tyrie.In 1987, the investigative journalist Roger Cook filmed Sayers attempting to extort money from a reporter posing as a businessman.  This was broadcast the following year as an episode of The Cook Report, and was considered extremely embarrassing by the UDA, not least because it showed Sayers struggling with basic arithmetic. In the immediate aftermath of the broadcast the UDA announced that Sayers had been removed from his position, although in fact he remained as Brigadier in Mid-Ulster until he was arrested sometime later. He was tried at Belfast Crown Court in 1989, and sentenced to ten years in prison.While in the Maze prison, Sayers studied to become a legal clerk.  He was released in 1999, and gained employment at Taylor & Co solicitors in Belfast.  In this role, he worked on legal cases for Johnny Adair, but his employer lost his licence to practice law in 2003, while facing bankruptcy proceedings.  In 2005, Sayers was charged with the theft of more than \u00a3700,000, and of dishonestly obtaining a mortgage.In 2006, Sayers was declared personally bankrupt for failing to pay overdue taxes, while, in 2009, he was fined for leaving waste on land in County Fermanagh, despite orders to clean up the site.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sayers (surname)", "response": ["* Eddie Sayers (born 1941), Northern Irish loyalist"]}, {"page": "Andy Tyrie", "response": ["As part of his political strategy Tyrie became close to South Belfast brigadier John McMichael and supported his development of the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party along Ulster nationalist lines.Taylor, pp. 168\u2013169 He had previously written in a UDA publication in the late 1970s that an independent Northern Ireland could \"take its rightful place in the world and not be seen as a country with a death-wish\", after becoming disillusioned with what he saw as the British government's lack of commitment to Northern Ireland.Wood, Ian S., Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p. 69 Tyrie shunned the limelight and as a consequence he appointed McMichael as official spokesman for, and thus the public face of, the UDA.Martin Dillon, The Trigger Men, Mainstream Publishing, 2003, p. 95 However, McMichael's assassination by the IRA in December 1987 and his replacement in the party by the less well-known Ray Smallwoods placed some doubts upon the political strategy that Tyrie had long advocated. Furthermore, resentment among UDA hardliners had been growing and they came to feel that Tyrie's leadership was too much about politics and not enough about military action.Taylor, pp. 198\u2013199 Tyrie was also criticised for what his internal opponents felt was a tendency towards cronyism, with the late 1980s seeing responsibility and position being given to internally unpopular figures like Jackie McDonald and Eddie Sayers, seemingly because they were personally close to Tyrie.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 252"]}]}}
