He made his return from injury on 19 August 2014, coming on as a substitute in the 64th minute, in a 2\u20130 loss against Portsmouth. Since returning to the first team from injury, Hackett regained his first team place for the side. During a 2\u20131 loss against Cambridge United on 14 November 2014, he came off as a substitute in the 56th minute \u2013 six minutes after setting up a goal for Ivan Toney; after the match, Manager Chris Wilder said: \"Chris Hackett had to come off because of his heart condition.\" Despite this, he then scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20132 loss against Bury on 26 December 2014. Towards the end of the 2014\u201315 season, Hackett soon found himself in the substitute bench in a number of matches, due to good forms from Lawson D'Ath and Ricky Holmes. Despite this, he contributed for the side when he scored two more goals between 21 February 2015 and 28 February 2015 against York City and Shrewsbury Town. At the end of the 2014\u201315 season, making forty appearances and scoring three times in all competitions, Hackett was placed on a transfer list by Manager Chris Wilder."]}]}}
