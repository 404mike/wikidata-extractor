He is known for his long friendship with John Lennon of The Beatles. He was a member of The Quarrymen, the precursor of the Beatles, and remained close to the group during their career.\nHe built an independent career as a restaurant manager, eventually founding the Fatty Arbuckle's chain of restaurants.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Apple Boutique", "response": ["Lennon's friend Peter Shotton managed the store with Harrison's wife Pattie Boyd's sister Jenny Boyd (who later married Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac). The Apple shop was a financial disaster, because theft was endemic and customers helped themselves to the stock, as did staff members, who had difficulty determining which things people had come in with and which they had picked up in the shop. The ethos of the venture and those operating it was antithetic to making accusations of shoplifting or calling for the London Police. The Fool's members also made a habit of taking their choice of the merchandise."]}]}}
