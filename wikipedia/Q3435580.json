She changed to focus on parasitology research, joining the lab of Lucien Brumpt in 1964 as a research assistant, and a year later relocating to Alain Chabaud's group at the MNHN. She was promoted in 1966 to senior lecturer and made group head of studying the Plasmodium genus. She briefly worked in London in the 1960s in the group of Cyril Garnham at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, where she met and begun collaborating with Wallace Peters and Robert Killick-Kendrick. During a research trip to the Central African Republic in 1964/5 Landau isolated and described the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi (naming it after her supervisor) from local Thamnomys rutilans thicket rats. She brought these samples with her to London, and together with Killick-Kendrich they isolated and identified another new rodent malaria species. The species was similar to Plasmodium berghei, and it was named Plasmodium yoelii in homage to the malarial researcher Meir Yoeli. To this day both species are used extensively in malaria research. Peters, Landau and Killick-Kendrick styled themselves as the 'plasmodiacs'."]}, {"page": "Killick-Kendrick, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Killick-Kendrick"]}]}}
