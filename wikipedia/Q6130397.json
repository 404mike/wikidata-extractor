His proposed design would have involved doubling the piers of the first bridge by installing the new columns on the east side of each of the existing piers, while arched brickwork would have been used to join the old and new elements alike. On top of these foundations, a brick decking that would be sufficiently wide as to carry two sets of girders as well as a double-track layout would be laid. Brunlees proposed that the permanent way should be laid on the upper booms of the girders. The addition of bowstring girders, positioned  high over the fairway, was considered to have much less exposure to the wind and greater lateral stiffness than the girders of the first bridge. The girders would also have been doubled, to be capable of resisting  to the square foot of wind pressure, while the piers as designed were to be capable of resisting a pressure of 900 lb per square foot. Overall, Brunlees' proposed structure would have possessed greater strength for resisting lateral pressure over the original. This proposal had an estimated total cost of \u00a3356,323. While it was carefully considered, the Board of Trade regarded the practice of connecting the old bridge's to a new design to be dangerous, leading to the rejection of both the proposed design and the overall bill."]}, {"page": "S\u00e3o Paulo Railway Company", "response": ["In 1859, a group of people led by the Bar\u00e3o de Mau\u00e1 convinced the Brazilian government that it was important to construct a railroad connecting S\u00e3o Paulo to the seaport at Santos.

The biggest difficulty was the task to overcome the steep east slope of the 800-meter high Serra do Mar, which was considered to be nearly impracticable. Therefore, Bar\u00e3o de Mau\u00e1 asked England to clarify the feasibility of a railway line for locomotive hauled trains within a budget limit of 200,000 \u00a3.

In 1332 the monks of Birkenhead Priory were granted exclusive rights to operate a ferry; following the dissolution of the monasteries these rights passed through a number of operators eventually to the township of Birkenhead. It is recorded that Marc Isambard Brunel suggested a road tunnel when designing the Birkenhead docks and from the 1850s a railway tunnel under the Mersey was proposed several times. The Mersey Pneumatic Railway received Royal Assent for a single line pneumatic railway in 1866 but failed to raise the necessary capital. In 1871 the Mersey Railway was given the necessary permissions for an orthodox two track railway connecting the Birkenhead Railway near their  station through a tunnel under the Mersey to an underground station serving Liverpool.

Subsequently, however, he became convinced that the tunnel would not be to the advantage of Great Britain, and thereafter would have nothing to do with the project. He was also consulting engineer to the Severn Tunnel, which, from its magnitude and the difficulties encountered in its construction, was one of the most notable engineering undertakings of the 19th century.
