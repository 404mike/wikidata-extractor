Black later explained the tactics were to put him as first runner to give the team a lead or at least keep the team in close contention. Black's leg was 44.6 from a standing start. Redmond's leg was 44.1, though he conceded the lead to Quincy Watts. Regis followed Everett round the third lap, clocking 44.3. While Everett handed to Pettigrew with a two-metre lead, Regis handed to Akabusi. Akabusi sat in behind the World Champion Pettigrew for the first 200\u00a0m of the final lap, closed around the crown of the final bend and then the much improved Akabusi kicked past Pettigrew in the final 80\u00a0m to pull off a spectacular victory, winning in a time of 2:57.53 \u2013 a British and European record time."]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Kriss AkabusiGarry CookTodd Bennett Phil Brown ||2:59.13"]}, {"page": "Kevin Young (hurdler)", "response": ["In 1992, Young won his first USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships title and was unbeaten prior to the Barcelona Olympics.  Running in lane 4, Young appeared to have the slowest reaction to the gun of the field.  To his inside, Winthrop Graham was the first over the first hurdle.   Using a left leg lead, 13 strides to the second hurdle, he had pulled to just slightly behind Graham.  Between the next two hurdles he ran 12 strides, alternating to the right leg lead over the fourth hurdle.  Over the fifth hurdle he had made up the stagger on Kriss Akabusi to his outside.  Relative to the hurdles, he had clearly passed Graham with the rest of the field clearly a full stride or more behind.  Running 13 strides the rest of the way, he passed the rest of the competitors to his outside between the next two hurdles.  A one stride lead over Graham at the eight hurdle became two by the ninth.  Young was still powerful as Graham was struggling.  Young tried to maintain that power into the final hurdle though he came up a little short, catching the face of the hurdle with his lead leg heel, riding the hurdle to the ground.  He maintained his powerful stride to the finish.  Realizing he had the clear victory, he raised his right arm in celebration 10 meters before the finish, slowing his last four strides."]}, {"page": "Noel's House Party", "response": ["Originally called the 'Gotcha Oscars' until the threat of legal action from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (which also prompted a redesign of the award), where hidden camera practical jokes were played on celebrities (these were pre-recorded during the months the show was off air). Notable victims were Barbara Windsor, Carol Vorderman, Jill Dando, Kriss Akabusi, Lionel Blair, Dave Lee Travis, Richard Whiteley, Eddie Large, Samantha Janus, Yvette Fielding, Status Quo, and the Queens Park Rangers football club. In the final episode of series 5, Dale Winton turned the tables on Edmonds with a surprise challenge that ended with a gunging. Another notable victim was Annabel Giles, the first victim who managed to spot the hidden camera, which had been placed in the back of a car, which meant the prank backfired. ", "A phone-in competition where a viewer chose from three currencies (aiming to select the greatest value of money; \u00a31,000 in the first 2 episodes), and a celebrity (usually a sports star like Graham Gooch, Frank Bruno, Kathy Tayler, Kriss Akabusi, Nick Gillingham, Henry Cooper, Stephen Hendry, Steve Davis, David Gower, Gary Lineker, John Regis, Paul Gascoigne, John Barnes, Lennox Lewis, and others) would climb into a perspex box containing a fan and a large quantity of banknotes selected by the call-in contestant. The celebrity had to grab as many of the notes as possible as they were blown around by the fan. Before the game starts, a chosen player is picked from the call in contestants who got a question correct during the show or from a previous weeks show to be picked, there would be three different bundles of money, usually two known countries and one bundle known as the \"Crinkley Bottom Groats\" which was pegged to a generally random country, all valued within \u00a31,000, sometimes more or sometimes less. Noel would ask the caller three questions based on that week's news. Each correct answer gave the celebrity 20 seconds in the box (up to a total of 60 seconds) accompanied by music and the audience counting down from ten to one. The format was changed slightly in series 4, in which the caller could choose a member of the studio audience to do the \"grand grabbing\" (the audience member would win the same amount of money the caller won). During Season 4, Grab a Grand had a few quirks added in, a few times some modified moments, with balloons inside the box, the walls falling down allowing audience members to help, door jammed, cheating, machine broke, even being flipped for Number Cruncher and inside a woman's house too when NTV happened. Then in the first episode of series 5, the box was blown up live during the show and the segment was revamped with the entire studio audience now playing grabbing notes that were being blown around by two large industrial fans as the celebrity would run into to collect, rather than having the three currencies, instead it featured the groats as the main currency, mixed within the groats would be \"Golden Groats\" worth \u00a350 each if collected. There was an incident too when one of the callers had the same name but turned out it wasn't the person who called in, the real call in contestant had their grab a grand game at the start of the next episode as this one featured the grab a grand around the grand house track. Towards the end of series 5 variations were introduced : 'Grab a Granny', 'Grab a Grand Piano', and 'Grab a Grand National' etc.  The money was quickly counted on stage using a Cashmaster counting machine. The last Grab a Grand was done on the last episode of series 5 (coincidentally the 100th episode)."]}, {"page": "Gateshead International Stadium", "response": ["In 1989, Gateshead hosted the Europa Cup.
