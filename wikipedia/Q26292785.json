The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto the Brand Street; the central bay, which slightly projected forward, featured an arched doorway with a large keystone on the ground floor and mullioned windows on the first floor flanked by full-height pilasters supporting a modillioned pediment with the town's coat of arms in the tympanum. The pilasters were carved at the top with the letters \"HUDC\" (for Hitchin Urban District Council) and \"AD MCM\" (AD 1900). A cupola was erected at roof level. Internally, the principal rooms are the main assembly hall, now known as the Mountford Hall, and a reception room known as the Lucas Room.Fitzpatrick-Matthews 2011, p. 58"]}]}}
