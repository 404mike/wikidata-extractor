He stunt-doubled for Michael Caine, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker and David Warner amongst others.\nWalsh is known for his work on the science fiction television programme Doctor Who. He worked on the show from 1966 to 1979. He is seen in this Video on YouTube as an Exxilon being shot by the Daleks, filmed in 1973.\nHe was also the stunt co-ordinator for Robin of Sherwood, devising three swordfighting sequences, which subsequently became standard movements on television and film. The moves were known as Robin Hood 1, 2 and 3.\nHis other credits include The Sandbaggers, Tales of the Unexpected, Z-Cars, Space: 1999, Dixon of Dock Green and Softly, Softly.\nWhen he wasn't stunting, he drove a black-cab from Edgware station taxi-rank.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2002 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 21 || Terry Walsh || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 62 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Stuntman, Actor || "]}, {"page": "Robin of Sherwood", "response": ["* Stunt co-ordination: Terry Walsh"]}, {"page": "Ace of Wands (TV series)", "response": ["4 episodes.

The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with a small body and a large \"green, dome-like head\" which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros' mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher's face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive.  The cast and crew regarded Davros' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; they thought he was a statue at first. When sitting in Davros' Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over his head that only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the \"disorienting\" situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face. Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes in the top of the bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue. Stuntman and actor Terry Walsh appeared uncredited in several roles."]}, {"page": "Terror of the Autons", "response": ["The scene at the start of Episode Three, where an Auton is hit by a car and tumbles off a cliff, was quite real. Dinny Powell was driving the vehicle in place of actor Richard Franklin, and stuntman Terry Walsh, playing the Auton, fell further down the slope than intended, being injured in the mishap. He nevertheless got back to his feet in the same take, as planned.Pixley, Andrew, \"The DWM Archive: Terror of the Autons,\" Doctor Who Magazine, #311, 12 December 2001, Panini Comics, p. 31. Letts requested that a sequence near the story's ending, in which Yates yells to the Doctor, \"We've got him now!\", be reshot because Franklin's performance was too over-the-top. Franklin was grateful for this."]}, {"page": "The Sontaran Experiment", "response": ["Although the serial was the third to feature Baker, it was actually the second shot, hence the out-of-sequence production code. This was only the second serial in the history of Doctor Who (the first being 1970's Spearhead from Space) to be shot entirely on location, in this case at Hound Tor on Dartmoor. However, unlike Spearhead from Space and the location material for other serials, the production was mounted entirely on videotape using early portable video equipment, rather than on the usual 16mm film.  This use of location video was remarkable for the time, but technical problems are evident in the final programmes. This was also the first and only Doctor Who story where there were no interior scenes at all. During shooting, Baker broke his collarbone. However, because part of his costume was a large scarf, he could conceal the neck brace he had to wear following the injury. For action scenes, he was doubled by regular stunt performer Terry Walsh, shot from several face-concealing angles. The filming of both episodes was completed in a week.", "Glyn Jones, who played the astronaut Krans, wrote the First Doctor serial The Space Museum (1965); he was the only person both to act and write for Doctor Who during its original 1963-89 run. The Sontaran Experiment contains the last major role played by Kevin Lindsay before his death in 1975 of a heart condition. He found the heavy Sontaran costume so difficult to manage that he could not leave the Hound Tor location for breaks, and also could not perform the fight scene \u2013 a stand-in, Stuart Fell, was used instead. Terry Walsh not only played a minor role as an astronaut, but doubled for Tom Baker in parts of episode two, after Baker broke a collarbone during filming. This meant that the climactic fight was performed by two stand-ins rather than the original actors. Most of the actors playing the GalSec astronauts were South African. This was specified in the casting, as the writers, Bob Baker and Dave Martin, were interested in language change and reasoned that the multi-linguistic influences on South African English might resemble future developments of the English language."]}, {"page": "Revenge of the Cybermen", "response": ["The story was shot on the same set as The Ark in Space \u2013 representing a substantial cost saving \u2013 with location filming in Wookey Hole Caves. It was also shot in the production block immediately after Ark, which explains why the production code is out of broadcast sequence. The location filming at Wookey Hole was plagued by a series of problems which the crew blamed on a curse.Michael Briant, \"The Tin Men and the Witch\" documentary, Revenge of the Cybermen DVD release. The curse apparently was brought about when the production staff found a small rock formation that the locals called \"The Witch\". Despite warnings, they proceeded to put a witch hat and cloak on it. Briant encountered an individual in spelunking gear which the Wookey Hole staff had no knowledge of, whom Briant was convinced was the spirit of a potholer who had died in the caves, three years earlier. The assistant floor manager suffered a severe attack of claustrophobia, another crew member fell ill, and an electrician suffered a broken leg when a ladder collapsed. During the scene when Sarah Jane rides one of the water skimmers, the boat went wild and Sladen was forced to jump off, treading water despite heavy boots until her rescue by Terry Walsh, the programme's longtime stuntman. Both required precautionary vaccinations at a local hospital but were otherwise unhurt. The boat disappeared and was never seen again."]}, {"page": "The Creature from the Pit", "response": ["David Brierley makes his debut as the voice of K9 in this story, taking over from John Leeson. Adrasta's engineer, Tollund, was played by former Doctor Who director Morris Barry. Eileen Way, who played Karela, also played the Old Mother in the first Doctor Who story, An Unearthly Child (1963).  Geoffrey Bayldon, who played Organon, would go on to portray an alternate version of the Doctor, one who never left Gallifrey, in the Big Finish Production Auld Mortality. Terry Walsh played Doran in Part One; this was his final appearance in the series having appeared in various roles since 1966 as well as acting as fight arranger and the stunt double for both Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker."]}, {"page": "Doctor Who \u2013 The Ultimate Adventure", "response": ["*Terry Walsh as Mercenary / Duelling guard"]}, {"page": "The Mark of Archanon", "response": ["*Terry Walsh \u2014 Eagle Three Astronaut (Stuart)"]}, {"page": "Journey to Where", "response": ["* Terry Walsh \u2013 Highlander Guard"]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac episodes", "response": ["| Cherry Gillespie, James Warwick, Peter Woodward, Patricia Quinn, Colin Jeavons, Nick Burnell, Terry Walsh"]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*21 April \u2013 Terry Walsh, actor and stuntman (born 1939)"]}, {"page": "1939 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 5 May \u2013 Terry Walsh, actor and stuntman (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "Friday Night, Saturday Morning", "response": ["| 2 April 1982 || Jane Walmsley || Buzz, Julian Barnes, Jocelyn Stevens, David Puttnam, Colin Welland, David Soul, John McVicar, Gareth Hunt, Jeremy Nichols, Terry Walsh, Allen Whalley"]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac cast members", "response": ["*Terry Walsh"]}, {"page": "Visions (convention)", "response": ["| Jon Pertwee, Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, Frazer Hines, Michael Keating, Sally Knyvette, Michael Praed, Jason Connery, Mark Ryan, Terry Walsh, Dave Rogers, Robert Allen, John Peel, John Freeman, Linda Thorson, Eric Hoffman, Jean-Marc Lofficier", "| Sophie Aldred, Brian Blessed, Michael Craze, Paul Darrow, Mira Furlan, Hattie Hayridge, Norman Lovett, Sylvester McCoy, Michael O'Hare, Michael Praed, Gareth Thomas, Terry Walsh, Anneke Wills, Kate Orman, Gary Schofield, Paul Cornell, Kim \"Howard\" Johnson"]}, {"page": "Quiller (TV series)", "response": ["| Patrick Magee, Celia Gregory, Michael Latimer, Steve Plytas, Michael Wynne and Terry Walsh"]}, {"page": "BBC2 Playhouse", "response": ["| Derek MartinKen CampbellAlan FordBilly CorneliusDominic AllanTerry WalshDoug SheldonGeoffrey ToddJohn HoganStanley PriceMichael Sheard"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2002", "response": ["*Terry Walsh, 62, British stuntman."]}, {"page": "Terry Walsh", "response": ["Terry Walsh may refer to:", "*Terry Walsh (actor),  British actor and stuntman", "*Terry Walsh (field hockey), Australian field hockey coach and player", "*Terry Walsh (footballer), Australian rules footballer", "*Terry Walsh (Love Island)"]}]}}
