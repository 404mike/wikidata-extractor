The Guinness Book of World Records reported that the series was the most expensive documentary series per minute ever produced. A re-edited version of Walking with Dinosaurs aired on Discovery Kids for the first season of Prehistoric Planet. It was made more appropriate for children by removing most of the graphic content such as dinosaurs eating each other and trimming down some footage to fit the run time.", "Creator Tim Haines contemplated the idea of a dinosaur-centric documentary in 1996, spurred by the resurgence of public interest in prehistoric life following the release of Jurassic Park (1993). Together, with producer Jasper James and effects specialist Mike Milne, Haines shot a six-minute pilot in Cyprus as a proof-of-concept to BBC Worldwide and Discovery Channel for financing. Principal photography took place at a variety of global locations, including Conguill\u00edo National Park in Chile, the Redwood National and State Parks in California, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Tasmania, and the Bahamas; the basis for these locations was that at the time, grass was thought to have not appeared in the Mesozoic era. Filming consisted of wide landscape shots devoid of any live-action creatures and close-up shots with animatronics.", "| Tim Haines, Jasper James, Georgann Kane, Tomi Bednar Landis, John Lynch, Mike Milne"]}, {"page": "Sea Monsters (TV series)", "response": ["A companion book, Sea Monsters: Prehistoric Predators of the Deep (published as Chased by Sea Monsters: Prehistoric Predators of the Deep in the United States), was co-authored by Marven and Jasper James, producer and director of the series. The book received positive reviews, with reviewers noting that though it was based on a TV series, it also stood on its own as an information source about extinct sea creatures. In 2011, an exhibition based on the series, the Sea Monsters Exhibition, was held at Bournemouth International Centre in Dorset. In addition to imagery from the series, the exhibition featured full-scale models of both modern and prehistoric sea creatures as well as behind-the-scenes information on how the animals were reconstructed and brought \"back to life\".", "Following his work in The Giant Claw and Land of Giants, Marven was approached by Jasper James, producer of both episodes and director of Land of Giants, about Sea Monsters. Marven had a great passion for sharks and had already dived and swum together with the biggest sharks alive today, which led James to come up with the idea of a time-travelling programme in which Marven immersed himself in the deadliest seas of all time, diving with the largest sharks of all time as well as various other prehistoric sea creatures. Marven was enthusiastic about the project, referring to it as a \"mouthwatering prospect\" in the companion book to the series. The series was narrated by Karen Hayley.", "The inclusion of a presenter instead of just narration was notably criticised by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who stated that \"I think the Nigel Marven programmes are awful, awful - really naff\". Dawkins elaborated, saying that \"it is as though they think the public are so stupid that they can't enjoy the spectacle of the animals themselves\" and \"isn't it at least patronising and condescending when television people assume, without asking them, that their audiences can't cope with science unless the pill is coated with the sugar of personal anecdote?\". Defending Sea Monsters, Jasper James did not believe that the series was patronising, stating that \"if you can enjoy the drama of a programme while learning something then that's great\".", "Jasper James and Nigel Marven co-authored a companion book for the series, titled Sea Monsters: Prehistoric Predators of the Deep (published in the United States as Chased by Sea Monsters: Prehistoric Predators of the Deep). The book begins with a description of the Big Bang, before going through the seven periods of time featured in the series, from the Ordovician to the Pliocene, referred to as the \"seven most deadly seas of all time\". Each chapter features renderings of the animals as seen in the series and sidebars feature information about each of the featured animals, including how to pronounce their names, their classification, their size and their diet."]}, {"page": "Nature documentary", "response": ["* Jasper James"]}, {"page": "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program", "response": ["| John Lynch & Tomi Bednar Landis, executive producers; Tim Haines & Jasper James, producers/directors; Georgann Kane, writer; Mike Milne, computer animation director", "| Tim Haines & Mick Kaczorowski, executive producers; Jasper James, producer/writer; Nigel Paterson, producer/director/writer; Sharon Reed & William Sargent, computer animation executive producers; Mike Milne, computer animation director; Kate Bartlett & Michael Olmert, writers", "| Gaynelle Evans, executive producer; Adam Kemp, BBC executive producer; Tim Haines & Jasper James, producers/directors/writers; Mike Milne, director of CGI; Sharon Reed, William Sargent and Fiona Walkinshaw, executive producers of CGI"]}, {"page": "Nigel Marven", "response": ["* Sea Monsters by Nigel Marven and Jasper James - BBC Books, 2003, , 167 pages, hardback", "* Chased By Sea Monsters by Nigel Marven and Jasper James, DK ADULT, 2004, ", "* Prehistoric Park with Poster - adapted by Susan Evento, created by Jasper James, Meredith Books, 2007, , 48 pages."]}, {"page": "Andr\u00e9 Dussollier", "response": ["|Tim Haines and Jasper James"]}, {"page": "David B.
