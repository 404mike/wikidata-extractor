Harrison Matthews's monographic treatment of the sperm whale, published in 1938, includes the following: \"Nearly all male Sperm whales carry scars caused by the suckers and claws of large squids, scars caused by suckers up to 10\u00a0cm. [] in diameter being common. The claw marks take the form of scratches 2\u20133\u00a0m. [] in length, and appear to be of more frequent occurrence than sucker marks\".Matthews, 1938 Ellis (1998a:142) wrote that this 10\u00a0cm figure is \"so much larger than any other recorded sucker dimensions that one suspects some sort of error, either in measuring or in transcription.\""]}, {"page": "Drygalski Fjord", "response": ["According to L.

In 1954, the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee recommended that this name be altered to Harrison Point to avoid duplication with Matthews Point (also named for L.
