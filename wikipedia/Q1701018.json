He is also an accomplished guitar, drum, trumpet, cello, and double bass player. Nearly as well known as his music is his appearance: he is always pictured wearing sunglasses, with the striking contrast of bald head and robust chin beard.

The Electric Spring festival is an exploration of electronic and experimental music, featuring the 50-channel, 64-loudspeaker Huddersfield Immersive Sound System (HISS). The Mrs Sunderland Music festival is the second oldest in the United Kingdom, started in 1889 lasting for nine days each year.

The band name was changed to McCoy, and they built up a busy gigging schedule, whilst also independently playing various sessions. Eventually, McCoy left to join Atomic Rooster. His replacement was the band's sound engineer and a close friend of Paul Samson's, Chris Aylmer. Aylmer suggested a name change to Samson, and recommended a young drummer, Clive Burr, whom he had previously played with in the band Maya. Burr joined, and Samson was born, although for a time Paul Samson used bassist Bill Pickard and drummer Paul Gunn on odd gigs, when Aylmer and Burr were honouring previous commitments. Various other people were tried out to expand the line up: Paul Samson got in touch with an old bandmate, bass player Stewart Cochrane, and asked him to try out with the group as a four-piece, with the current bass player Chris Aylmer on second guitar alongside Paul. Only one gig was played in this incarnation, at The Nag's Head pub in Rochester, Kent on 11 March 1978, where it was decided that Samson and Aylmer's playing styles were not compatible, so they went back to being a three-piece. Cochrane later joined the avant-garde jazz-rock band Spanish Fly; and later continued his career as a band-leader for Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises. Cochrane performed and recorded with members of bands The Animals, Nashville Teens and Steve Hackett Band.  Talking to Cochrane in 2017 he allegedly said \u201cNot getting the Samson gig was the best thing to happen to him as the band\u2019s lifestyle choices and the music wasn\u2019t his cup-of-tea anyway\u201d.  It appears that Cochrane and Samson had a disagreement about Samson wanting Cochrane to dress up in some weird black leather military style uniform on stage, but they fell out mainly over Cochrane pointing out that the Samson logo on the Telephone single sleeve looked too much like the Nazi SS runes.  Their friendship since their teen band days finished there and then.
