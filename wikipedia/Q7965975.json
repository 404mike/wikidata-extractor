Along with his friend and collaborator Jacob Epstein, Gill planned the construction in the Sussex countryside of a colossal, hand-carved monument in imitation of the large-scale structures at Gwalior Fort in Madhya Pradesh. Throughout the second half of 1910 Epstein and Gill would met on an almost daily basis. Earlier in the year they had held long discussions with Rothenstein and other artists, including Augustus John and Ambrose McEvoy, about the formation of a quasi-religious brotherhood. At Ditchling, Epstein worked on elements of Oscar Wilde's tomb in Pere Lachaise cemetery for which Gill designed the inscription before sending Joseph Cribb to Paris to carve the lettering. Cribb had come to Ditchling with Gill in 1907. Other apprentices included David Jones, David Kindersley (who in turn became a successful sculptor and engraver) and his nephew, John Skelton, Laurie Cribb, Donald Potter and Walter Ritchie."]}, {"page": "Kenilworth", "response": ["*Walter Ritchie (1919\u20131991), sculptor, lived and worked in Kenilworth.Rogers, Byron, The Arts: Sculpture - do's and don'ts Walter Ritchie's career...The Sunday Telegraph 12 May 1996."]}, {"page": "Shirley, West Midlands", "response": ["Our Lady of the Wayside RC church contains one of Elisabeth Frink's Risen Christ sculpturesDomesday Reloaded: A Solihull Parish Priest (2) as well as art by Walter Ritchie."]}, {"page": "Delapr\u00e9 Abbey", "response": ["*\"The Lady with Kittens\" and \"The Lovers\", the work of Walter Ritchie, were donated to Northampton after being displayed at an exhibition of brickwork sculptures at The Building Centre, London.
