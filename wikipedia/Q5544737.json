Her father was the artist George Spencer Watson and her mother, Hilda, was a dancer and mime artist. Her father purchased Dunshay Manor, which became Watson's home for the rest of her life. The family decorated the Manor in the arts and crafts style and used its outbuildings as studios and for dance and theatre productions. Dunshay Manor was near Langton Matravers on the Isle of Purbeck and there were several stone quarries in the area. Watson became fascinated by the masons and quarrymen she saw working the local Purbeck stone with traditional tools and decided to become a sculptor. "]}]}}
