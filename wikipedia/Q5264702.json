Labour won a very slim majority of four seats, forming a government for the first time since 1951. Labour achieved a swing of just over 3%, although its vote rose by only 0.3%. The main shift was the swing from the Conservatives to the Liberals of 5.7%. The Liberals won nearly twice as many votes as in 1959, partly because they had 150 more candidates. Wilson became Prime Minister, replacing Douglas-Home. The four-seat majority was not sustainable for a full Parliament, and Wilson called another general election in 1966. In particular the small majority meant the government could not implement its policy of nationalising the steel industry, due to the opposition of two of its backbenchers, Woodrow Wyatt and Desmond Donnelly."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Desmond Donnelly"]}, {"page": "Gwilym Lloyd George", "response": ["Lloyd-George lost his seat (standing again as a National Liberal and Conservative) in the 1950 general election.
