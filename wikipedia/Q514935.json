He was one of the first to exploit electron microscopy as a chemical tool, especially to deduce active-site reactivities from the surface topography of many minerals and crystal hydrates. At the University of Aberystwyth (1969\u20131978) he elucidated the surface chemistry of diamond, clay minerals, metals and intercalates by pioneering UV and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. He also initiated the field of crystal engineering of organic molecules. As head of physical chemistry department at the University of Cambridge (1978\u20131986), then a separate department to chemistry, he used magic-angle-spinning NMR and high-resolution electron microscopy to characterize and determine the structures of zeolites and other nanoporous catalysts. As Fullerian Professor and Director of the Royal Institution and of the Davy\u2013Faraday Research Laboratory, he utilized synchrotron radiation to characterize, in situ, new catalysts designed for green chemistry and clean technology.:\u200a6\u20137,\u200a623\u2013638\u200aHe was the recipient of many national and international awards; and, for his contribution to geochemistry, the mineral meurigite was named in his honour. He was Master of Peterhouse, University of Cambridge (1993\u20132002), and was knighted in 1991 \"for services to chemistry and the popularisation of science\".Thomas authored more than 1200 scientific articles and several books, including  Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place (1991),Principles and Practice of Heterogeneous Catalysis (with W. John Thomas, 1997, 2014), and Design and Applications of Single-Site Heterogeneous Catalysts: Contributions to Green Chemistry, Clean Technology and Sustainability (2012).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 15", "response": ["*  1932   \u2013 John Meurig Thomas, Welsh chemist and academic (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*John Meurig Thomas (1932-2020), chemist "]}, {"page": "John Thomas", "response": ["* John Meurig Thomas (1932\u20132020), British chemist and materials scientist"]}, {"page": "Aberystwyth University", "response": ["*Sir John Meurig Thomas FRS, chemist, professor, author"]}, {"page": "Swansea University", "response": ["* Sir John Meurig Thomas, chemist"]}, {"page": "Llanelli", "response": ["*Sir John Meurig Thomas (1932\u20132020), chemist and science historian"]}, {"page": "Huw Edwards", "response": ["Edwards has been critical of some England-based newspapers for printing stories dismissive of the use of the Welsh language.
