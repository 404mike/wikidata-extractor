The novel satirises the class and political system of Britain. Oran's reliability, honesty and status as a \"natural man\" stand in contrast to the cowardice, greed, folly, and inequality of \"civilised\" human society. In Frank Challice Constable's The Curse of Intellect (1895), the protagonist Reuben Power travels to Borneo to capture and train an orangutan \"to know what a beast like that might think of us\". Orangutans are featured prominently in the 1963 science fiction novel Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle and the media franchise derived from it. Orangutans are typically portrayed as bureaucrats like Dr. Zaius, the science minister."]}, {"page": "Constable (surname)", "response": ["*Frank Challice Constable (1846\u20131937), English barrister and writer"]}]}}
