While en route to Brazil they visited the U.S. Naval Hospital in Washington where they met U. S. Surgeon General George Miller Sternberg who is considered the first U.S. bacteriologist, and then proceeded to Havana where they met Dr Finlay and his co-workers on 25 July 1900, and also the U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission, led by Dr Walter Reed, which subsequently confirmed Dr Finlay's theory. Among Reed's team was bacteriologist Dr Jesse Lazear who died a month later on 26 September aged 34 while investigating the disease. On 24 August Durham and Myers arrived in Pari (modern day Belem) in the northern state of Par\u00e1, Brazil, where they established a laboratory to study the transmission of the disease and were among the first to establish its transmission by mosquitoes. Durham and Myers were aware of the risks that they were taking; however, on 16 January 1901, after conducting the fourteenth autopsy on victims of yellow fever both men found they were themselves infected. They were transferred to the Domingos Freire Isolation Hospital in Pari where Durham recovered but Myers died four days later, aged 28.Obituary of Dr Walter Myers in the British Medical Journal BMJ 1901;1:310The National Archives In his subsequent report Durham deduced that they had both been infected through mosquito bites."]}, {"page": "Alfredo Kanthack", "response": ["Shortly before his death he recommended one of his promising students, Walter Myers, for a John Lucas Walker scholarship."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge", "response": ["*Walter Myers \u2013 physician and parasitologist"]}]}}
