Stott chose a familiar rural scene for the Summer Exhibition with a painting entitled Trees Old and Young, Sprouting a Shady Boon for Simple Sheep (1888). The uncomely title harked back to the romantic poet John Keats and his poem of shepherd-hunter Endymion published in 1818 and represented a brief period in Stott's career where poetry and art were intertwined. Idyllic rural settings were by now established themes and Stott chose In an Orchard \u2013 An Early Summer Morning (1892) and Changing Pastures (1893). The latter is an intimate painting of a young cowgirl leading her herd from one field to the next in the gloaming light at the end of the day. The setting sun was a leitmotif of Stott and many of his paintings are executed in the twilight, leading to one critic to describe him as \u2018the poet-painter of the twilight\u2019https://www.townereastbourne.org.uk/exhibition/edward-stott-master-colour-atmosphere/ Edward Stott: A Master of Colour and Atmosphere, Towner Gallery, Eastbourne Exhibition (2018). Three paintings exhibited at the New Gallery: The Horse Pond (1891), Noonday (1895) and The Golden Moon (1896) are more experimental in their use of colour lacking non-essential detail. The figure of the boy astride the horse in the former is impressionistic, his features deliberately simplified. There is a timeless, unchanging quality to these paintings where atmosphere and nostalgia predominate at the expense of realism."]}, {"page": "List of works by Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3", "response": ["|200px || Sir Alfred East || 1907 || Portrait ||"]}, {"page": "History of Taormina", "response": ["In 1905, the English artist Robert Hawthorn Kitson, heir to Kitson and Company but driven from Britain by homophobia, built a house in Taormina.
