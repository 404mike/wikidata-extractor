A pioneer of mass entertainment, Tyers had to become also a pioneer of mass catering, of outdoor lighting, of advertising, and of all the logistics involved in running one of the most complex and profitable business ventures of the eighteenth century in Britain.\"The English pleasures of Vauxhall  John Barrell, 25 January 2012 References to Vauxhall are, for 150 years, as ubiquitous as references to \"Broadway\" later would be. For example, an old Polish word for a pleasure garden (foksal) and the name of Foksal street in Warsaw are Polonized versions of Vauxhall. In Russia, \"vokzal\" has become synonymous with railway stations (and sometimes other transportation hubs) due to the preponderance of such \"entertainment establishments\" as the Vauxhall near train stations in the 18th and 19th centuries."]}, {"page": "1975 in poetry", "response": ["* John Barrell and John Bull (eds), The Penguin Book of English Pastoral Verse"]}, {"page": "List of University of Essex people", "response": ["* John Barrell - Professor of English, University of York"]}, {"page": "Thomas Paine's \"Rights of Man\": A Biography", "response": ["Conversely, scholar John Barrell wrote that the book contained historical inaccuracies and criticized its similarities to John Keane's book Tom Paine: A Political Life.

Monamy supplied at least four prominently displayed naval scenes for the Gardens. These are now lost, but known from engravings. In a review for the \"Times Literary Supplement\", 27 January 2012, of Coke and Borg's \"Vauxhall Gardens\", John Barrell points out that \"a national art in the making was reinforced by a number of modern history paintings by Peter Monamy, of English naval victories\". Two of these paintings (the Algerine Pirates and Sweet William's Farewell, both engraved by Paul Fourdrinier, who since about 1900 has also been mistakenly referred to as Peter, or Pierre, Fourdrinier) appear to have been on display prior to the war with Spain, which began in 1739. A substantial number of prints, in mezzotint and line, after Monamy's works, were produced in the years from about 1730 until just before his death in 1749. These continued to be reproduced and copied, in some quantity, until well into the 19th century. Those engravings executed during Monamy's lifetime are an excellent guide to the genuine manner of his oeuvre."]}, {"page": "Barrell", "response": ["*John Barrell (born 1943), British academic and currently Professor of English at the University of York"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of King's College, Cambridge", "response": ["* John Barrell"]}, {"page": "Harriet Guest", "response": ["Guest married John Barrell, also of the University of York, in London in 1992.England & Wales marriages 1837-2008 Transcription.
