Later, when personnel was allocated to each paper, he was a news reporter on the P&J for some years before moving to the evening newspaper's sports desk as chief sportswriter and deputy sports editor.\nHis broadcasting career began in 1980 with the launch of the Grampian Television (now STV North) regional news programme, North Tonight. Gilfeather joined the programme as a sports correspondent although he would later also work on news coverage. As well as reporting for North Tonight, Gilfeather fronted the North Tonight spin-off Summer at Six and popular local quiz show Top Club which ran for nine years. He also worked on general election coverage for ITN and has been featured in out-takes on LWT's It'll be Alright on the Night.\nGilfeather is now a freelance journalist and broadcaster and writes for several national newspapers, including The Times, the Daily Record, The Herald and the Sunday Herald. He has written a weekly current affairs column for the Evening Express since 2001. He can also be heard covering football for Soccer Saturday on Sky Sports.\nHis play \"The Harp and the Violet\", based upon a real-life incident in Dundee in May 1941, was given its first performance at Dundee Rep in November 1991. It was directed by Robert Robertson and designed by Monika Nisbet. The cast included Martin McCardie [Frank McGarrity], Carol Brannan [Bridget McGarrity], Frank Ellis [L/Cpl. Bert Leitch] and Martyn James [Gino Esposito].\nIn November 2009, his first book - Confessions of a Highland Hero - a ghost-written autobiography of Steve Paterson, the former Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Aberdeen football manager whose career was beset by gambling and alcohol addiction - was published by Birlinn. The book, later released in paperback, entered the Scottish bestsellers list soon after its publication.\nIn 2010, Birlinn published Gilfeather's second book - Ross County: From Highland League To Hampden. The book charted the Highland League side's history and the Scottish Cup run of 2009-10, during which they dumped Celtic and Hibs out of the competition before falling to Dundee United in the final.\nIn October 2021 Gilfeather was fired from the Evening Express for refusing to retract misogynistic comments made in his column where he accused women for not taking responsibility in preventing their drinks from being spiked and subsequently being assaulted.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evening Express (Scotland)", "response": ["Moreen Simpson, Scott Begbie the entertainments editor, former Grampian TV presenter Frank Gilfeather.
