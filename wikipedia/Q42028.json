Plans to protest against the London visit by King Paul and Queen Frederika in July 1963 were met by official attempts to prevent the demonstrations and draconian prison sentences on demonstrators. The government was criticized in the press for the severity of its treatment of the demonstrators and eventually there were embarrassing climb-downs.  Some of the sentences were overturned on appeal and the Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, had to offer financial compensation.  One of the demonstrators, Donald Rooum, proved that an offensive weapon had been planted on him and forced a public inquiry that criticized the police and led to the eventual imprisonment of three officers.  But a nine-months sentence on Terry Chandler, secretary of the London Committee, was upheld on appeal.Ewing, K. D., \"Cold war, civil liberties and the House of Lords\", in Campbell, Tom, K.D. Ewing and Adam Tomkins (eds), The Legal Protection of Human Rights, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011. Diana Shelley said that the imprisonment of Chandler, \"the force which had driven\" the Committee throughout the summer, had a profoundly damaging effect.
