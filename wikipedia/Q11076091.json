The union's central committee believed that he had embezzled the money, and removed him from office.  Four years later, Thomas Dunning persuaded the union to reorganise as the Bookbinders' Consolidated Union, a more centralised body, while he merged the various London unions to form the London Consolidated Lodge of Journeymen Bookbinders.  The plan was for the London union to merge into the national union, and take over its leadership, but it was found to be in a weak financial position, and the national union decided to remain separate.  The national union itself began struggling, and nearly collapsed in 1842, leading the headquarters of the union to move to the stronger branch in Dublin the following year."]}, {"page": "H. R.

Dunning suffered an accident in 1871, and as a result, King was in his place appointed as secretary to a joint committee campaigning for a maximum nine hour working day.  The committee brought together the London Consolidated Society together with the Dayworking Bookbinders Society and the Consolidated Union, and quickly achieved its aim."]}, {"page": "London Consolidated Lodge of Journeymen Bookbinders", "response": ["Thomas Dunning emerged as the leading figure in the London bookbinders, and he used the prestige of the successful strike to convince the national Bookbinders' Consolidated Relief Fund to reorganise as a more centralised organisation, the Bookbinders' Consolidated Union.  He also convinced the three London lodges of bookbinders to merge, with the plan of taking over the management of the union, but after they did so, they found that the Consolidated Union's finances were in a worse state than expected, and so the London Consolidated Lodge instead became a separate union.", ":1840: Thomas Dunning"]}]}}
