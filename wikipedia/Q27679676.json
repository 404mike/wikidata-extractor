His first marriage was in 1968, to Julie Ellis, and the couple had two daughters: Chlo\u00eb, a website designer, and Miranda, a wife and mother of three. The marriage ended in 1980, and in 1986, he wed psychotherapist Sally Rouse. Barker and Rouse had a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Xanthi. Daniel is an actor, comic writer, and voice artist, who has appeared in the 2020 revival of Spitting Image. In 2021, Xanthi's memoir of her relationship with her father, Will This House Last Forever?, was published. Barker and Rouse's marriage was dissolved in 1992. In 1998, he married the poet Hilary Davies, who he had met on the council of the Poetry Society. Partly owing to his relationship with Davies, Barker was received into the Catholic Church in 1997."]}, {"page": "Eddie Linden", "response": ["In 1991, the existence of Aquarius was said to be under threat, prompting a question in the House of Commons from Scottish Labour MP Brian Wilson to the Minister for the Arts, Tim Renton. However, this led to an Arts Council grant of \u00a32000, and the magazine continued, with the publication of Aquarius Women in 1992. This special edition devoted to contemporary women's writing was guest edited by Hilary Davies, featuring contributions by Mich\u00e8le Roberts, Jackie Kay, U.A. Fanthorpe, Carol Ann Duffy, Elspeth Barker, Marilyn Hacker, Helen Dunmore, Maureen Duffy, Fay Weldon and Elizabeth Jennings.", "Linden's 80th birthday was celebrated with a party at Conway Hall in 2015, at which he recited several of his poems. Barker's widow, the poet Hilary Davies, described Linden as \"loyal and non-judgmental\", and, comparing him to a meerkat, said he was \"sociable, communicative, ferreting in corners for choice morsels and then delighting in showing it to the community\". He was presented with a portrait of himself by London Irish artist Luke Canavan."]}]}}
