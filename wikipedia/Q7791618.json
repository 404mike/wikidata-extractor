Over recent decades, Hong Kong has witnessed increasing numbers of small households, elderly households and elderly living alone. The combined income is now split into more households. Many old people are living separately from their children in Hong Kong. These social changes have caused substantial changes in household income distribution. The income Gini coefficient, claims Kwok, does not discern these structural changes in its society. Household money income distribution for the United States, summarized in Table C of this section, confirms that this issue is not limited to just Hong Kong. According to the US Census Bureau, between 1979 and 2010, the population of the United States experienced structural changes in overall households, the income for all income brackets increased in inflation-adjusted terms, household income distributions shifted into higher income brackets over time, while the income Gini coefficient increased.Congressional Budget Office: Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007.

The Standard The Hong Kong media exposed Tsang's plan to live his retirement life in a 6,500 sq ft apartment in the nearby city of Shenzhen. The luxurious apartment is owned by the developer Wong Cho-bau, who has ties with the Chinese government and runs multiple businesses in both China and Hong Kong. It was reported that Tsang was set to rent the flat at a substantially discounted rate while renovation works, provided by the developer, were tailored to the demands of Tsang's wife. Tsang argued that declaration was not necessary and that his lease did not affect the government's decision on granting the broadcasting licence to DBC; he also argued that the lease was at market value.  The rental arrangement was widely considered politically insensitive and Tsang eventually dropped the plan in April. He was later summoned to answer questions from an open inquiry by the Hong Kong Legislative Council.
