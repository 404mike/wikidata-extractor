In 2008, a campaign was launched to encourage people to buy Jeff Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's song \"Hallelujah\" instead of 2008 X Factor winner Alexandra Burke's version; however Burke's version beat Buckley's version which charted at number two.

By 9 December (less than a week after launching) over 500,000 people had signed up, with much media interest. The campaign was ultimately successful with a winning margin of around 50,000 copies. The group performed a free concert in London as a thank you to all the fans.

This market was dominated by the big retail chains of Woolworths, Asda, WHSmith and Tesco. If you could not get your single into these stores, you were very unlikely to have a hit. Sadly for Otway, none of these stores would take the single. However, an orchestrated fan campaign saw Bunsen Burner reach number nine in the UK Charts.
