He also played in the Football League with Doncaster Rovers , Sunderland, Oldham Athletic and Scarborough. He was capped 4 times by the England U21 during the 1984\u201385 season.\nIn 1998 he returned to Doncaster as player/manager but following his departure 18 months later has since worked in sports media as a TV and radio analyst.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["He introduced massages and changed the canteen and team kit for the 1979\u201380 campaign. With no money available for transfers he was forced to turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.", "Bremner was appointed as Leeds United manager in October 1985, having impressed the boardroom with his work at Doncaster, particularly his negotiation skills during the sale of Ian Snodin; Leeds paid Doncaster \u00a345,000 in compensation. The club had declined during his absence; Leeds had dropped down into the Second Division, sold Elland Road to the council to raise money, and club supporters picked up a reputation for violence after regular hooligan riots in the stands. He quickly reinstated Don Revie's philosophy and his little traditions, for example he reinstated the sessions of carpet bowls on Friday evenings. Despite this he appointed Ian Snodin as club captain, and dropped former captain and teammate Peter Lorimer from the starting line eleven. He also moved on the young players signed by former manager and teammate Eddie Gray, choosing to sign experienced players in their place. Five key young players to leave the club were Scott Sellars (\u00a320,000 to Blackburn Rovers), Terry Phelan (free transfer to Swansea City), Denis Irwin, Tommy Wright and Andy Linighan (all to Oldham Athletic for \u00a360,000, \u00a355,000 and \u00a380,000 respectively). The money raised allowed him to buy central defender Brendan Ormsby (\u00a365,000 from Aston Villa), and also sign David Rennie, Brian Caswell and Ronnie Robinson. Leeds struggled in the 1985\u201386 season, but managed to steer away from the relegation zone to finish in 14th place."]}, {"page": "Neville Southall", "response": ["Former teammate Ian Snodin invited him to join Conference side Doncaster Rovers on a short-term deal at the start of the 1997\u201398 season. He signed with Wes Saunders's Torquay United of the Third Division in December 1998. He saved a penalty on his debut at Plainmoor, in a 2\u20130 win over Hull City and signed a contract lasting until the end of the 1998\u201399 campaign. He was named as Torquay's Player of the Year at the end of the season. However, on 29 January 2000, he picked up a concussion in a 2\u20131 defeat to Chester City at the Deva Stadium, and was substituted. Though he recovered from his injury after the match, he left the club not long afterwards."]}, {"page": "List of Everton F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Ian Snodin||||FB||1987\u20131994||201||9"]}]}}
