He made his first team debut against Gillingham in the Football League Cup in August 2000 and after impressing in reserve games was approached by Celtic manager Martin O'Neill about going to Parkhead on trial. He joined Celtic on loan on 5 October 2000, mainly playing for their under-21 side. In March 2001, Celtic offered Torquay a deal where they would only pay for Douglin if he made the grade at Parkhead, with no initial payment. This offer was turned down and Douglin returned to Plainmoor later that month. He began the following season on a weekly contract at Plainmoor, as he weighed up his options, but signed a new two-year deal on 5 September.\nHe was released by Torquay in February 2003 and had a trial with Hereford United. He subsequently joined Worcester City and in February 2004 joined Bromsgrove Rovers. He played nine times for Rovers, but, despite signing a new deal, left at the start of the following season.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, Douglin was with Rushall Olympic. He spent the 2006 close season coaching in the US at the Charlton Athletic US Soccer Academy, returning to Rushall in September 2006. He joined Tipton Town later in 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2000\u201301 Celtic F.C. season", "response": ["| Troy Douglin ||  Torquay United || Loan"]}, {"page": "Douglin", "response": ["*Troy Douglin (born 1982), English footballer"]}]}}
