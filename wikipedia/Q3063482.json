Ring modulation makes use of channel no. 3, to work with the other two channels. Bob Yannes developed the SID chip and later co-founded synthesizer company Ensoniq. Yannes criticized other contemporary computer sound chips as \"primitive, obviously\u00a0... designed by people who knew nothing about music\". Often the game music has become a hit of its own among C64 users. Well-known composers and programmers of game music on the C64 are Rob Hubbard, Jeroen Tel, Tim Follin, David Whittaker, Chris H\u00fclsbeck, Ben Daglish, Martin Galway, Kjell Nordb\u00f8 and David Dunn among many others. Due to the chip's three channels, chords are often played as arpeggios, coining the C64's characteristic lively sound. It was also possible to continuously update the master volume with sampled data to enable the playback of 4-bit digitized audio. As of 2008, it became possible to play four channel 8-bit audio samples, 2 SID channels and still use filtering."]}, {"page": "ZX Spectrum", "response": ["A number of notable games developers began their careers on the ZX Spectrum, including David Perry of Shiny Entertainment, and Tim and Chris Stamper (founders of Rare, formerly Ultimate Play the Game, maker of many games for Nintendo and Microsoft game consoles).

Sony has used that to craft more modern remakes. In early 2006, Sony released a remake of Lemmings for the PlayStation Portable, developed by Team17. It features all 120 levels from the original game, 36 brand-new levels as well as DataPack support (similar to the Extra Track system featured in Wipeout Pure), and a user-level editor. Every level in the game is a pre-rendered 3D landscape, although their gameplay is still 2D and remains faithful to the original game. User levels can be constructed from pre-rendered objects and distributed by uploading them to a PlayStation-specific Lemmings online community. The soundtrack also marks the final video game score created by longtime composer Tim Follin after he announced his retirement from the industry in mid-2005. In October 2006 the game was ported by developer Rusty Nutz for the PlayStation 2 with use of the EyeToy. The basic change in the concept is that the player must stretch and use his/her limbs in the recorded picture to aid the lemmings. In 2007, Team17 produced a similar remake of Lemmings for the PlayStation 3 for download through the PlayStation Network. The game has the similar graphical improvements as the PSP title, as well as on-line scoreboards and additional levels developed for high-definition display, but lacks the ability to create and share levels as the PSP version offers. Another remake, Lemmings Touch, was released for PlayStation Vita on 27 May 2014, developed by d3t Ltd.

The soundtrack maintains similarity to its predecessor with its prominent percussion and eclectic genres ranging between big band, disco and hip hop. The melodies and rhythms are largely comical in tone, but occasionally melancholic. Certain themes are reminiscent of compositions by Vangelis and Phil Collins. Wise cited Koji Kondo's music for the Mario and Zelda games, Geoff and Tim Follin's music for Plok, and synthesizer-based film soundtracks released in the 1980s as influences in creating the music for the Donkey Kong Country series.

The game features a musical score by Tim Follin, who has named the game's title track as his favourite among his compositions. It became one of his best-known tracks. Solstice was received positively by critics for its puzzles and graphics, and the audio was singled out for praise. A sequel, titled Equinox, was released for the Super NES in 1993.", "thumb|right|A sample of the opening theme of Solstice, composed by Tim Follin.", "The game's music was composed by Tim Follin. The primary background music was made to be atmospheric and dark, while the opening theme was made to be powerful. On his approach to the score, Follin commented that the \"folk\" melody style he had previously used for Ghouls 'n Ghosts was particularly suited for Solstice due to the game's fantasy-oriented title and setting. The title theme's changing moods and phases were an attempt by Follin to keep the track interesting; Follin felt that the constant evolution required to keep music in general interesting was imperative in video game music due to its lack of vocals and performance at the time. During development, a colleague of Follin played for him several works of game composer Rob Hubbard, which convinced Follin that the technical boundaries of the contemporary generation of hardware have been reached, and refocused his attention from the score's technique to the composition. While Follin retrospectively identified the title theme to be his favourite among his own compositions, he felt that his work on the in-game music could have been improved to be \"a lot more spacious and interesting\", as it \"looped too short and became irritating quite quickly\".", "The game's score was singled out for praise. Leadbetter proclaimed that \"the renowned Tim Follin comes up trumps yet again with some brilliant atmospheric scores\", and both he and Glancey, along with Rignall, considered the soundtrack to be some of the best they had heard on the NES. Regan described the game's soundtrack as \"moody and atmospheric\", and Semrad called the music \"fantastic\". Wyles, however, described the sound effects as \"ropey\" and the in-game background music as \"mediocre\". The title theme in particular became one of Follin's best-known tracks in retrospect. Brett Elston of GamesRadar+ proclaimed that \"if any 8-bit song could take you on a journey, this is it. From its modest, almost hobbit-like opening to its soaring jig halfway through, the title screen music tramples over all other NES music.\" He additionally described the game's primary background track as \"considerably more mellow but no less proficient and listenable\", and preferred its presence as in-game music \"because there's no way I could play ANYTHING with that title screen going nuts\". Nate Andrews of Nintendo World Report said that \"the regality of the opening track provides a fantastic build up for the ensuing blast, which nearly forces you to take a knee under its spectacle before dropping into extended, kicking jig, then moving into the rest of the prog-y soundtrack\". Layton Shumway of VentureBeat remarked that the theme \"sounds like a lost track from a Yes album\" and that it \"psyches you out with its single-note fanfare intro, instantly kicks into high gear with cascading synth lines, then settles into a propulsive 6/8 rock beat\".", "A sequel to Solstice, titled Equinox, was announced on January 1992, initially for a summer release that year, and was released for the Super NES on November 1993.
