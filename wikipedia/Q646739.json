However a ruptured Anterior cruciate ligament in September 1990 would lead to several seasons struggling with knee injuries, and he would only play four further games from that point before announcing his retirement in January 1996. Despite his career effectively ending at the age of 21 he was later inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame, and was seen as a player who would have been a key first team player for many years had it not been for his injury problems.\nPaul went on to spend ten years as a physiotherapist in the game, working with Macclesfield Town FC and Bolton Wanderers FC. In 2008 he was recruited by Manchester City FC as its 'City in the Community' Ambassador, helping to forge links with local charities. In 2013, Paul joined the Premier League as a Club Support Manager, liaising with various football academies across the north of England.

In 2012, a fan poll from The Guardian awarded English forward Wayne Rooney's 2011 Manchester derby bicycle kick the title of best goal in the Premier League's history. When Italian striker Mario Balotelli, during his youth development years, patterned his skills on those of Brazilian midfielder Ronaldinho and French midfielder Zinedine Zidane, he fixated on the bicycle kick. In 2015 against Liverpool, Juan Mata scored an iconic bicycle kick that secured the win for his team. Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo's Champions League bicycle kick goal, in 2018, received widespread praise from fellow footballers, including English forward Peter Crouch, who tweeted \"there is only a few of us who can do that\", and Swedish forward Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, who challenged Ronaldo to \"try it from 40 meters\"\u2014a reference to his FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award-winning 2012 bicycle kick goal during an international friendly match between Sweden and England."]}, {"page": "Manchester derby", "response": ["A large number of non-competitive Manchester derbies have taken place, including the first match between the two sides' precursors, Newton Heath and St Mark's, in November 1881.

In recent years, non-competitive matches between the teams have generally been testimonials, such as those for Paul Lake and Denis Irwin.

He was part of the 1986 FA Youth Cup winning team that also included the likes of Paul Lake and David White.

Brightwell became known as a versatile player who played at every single outfield position during his career at the club; however he was most commonly used either as a right-back or as on the right side of midfield. City then finished ninth in the Second Division in 1987\u201388, before Mel Machin led them to promotion in 1988\u201389 with a second-place finish; they ended 17 points behind champions Chelsea and one point ahead of third-place Crystal Palace. Brightwell was also capped four times by England under-21s, scoring twice, in 1988 and 1989. He did not score many goals, but did memorably shoot into the top corner from 25 yards on 3 February 1990, to earn City a draw with rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford.
