According to Time, former Czech foreign minister Jan Kavan said: \"Why should we single out the Bene\u0161 Decrees?\u00a0... They belong to the past and should stay in the past. Many current members of the E.U. had similar laws.\" In 2009 eurosceptic Czech president V\u00e1clav Klaus demanded an opt-out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, feeling that the charter would render the Bene\u0161 decrees illegal. In 2010, when Masaryk University erected a statue to Edvard Benes, local journalist Michael Ka\u0161parek criticized the move because of what he dubbed \"Expel Them All, Let God Sort Them Out!\" decrees. In January 2013 conservative Czech presidential candidate Karel Schwarzenberg said, \"What we committed in 1945 would today be considered a grave violation of human rights, and the Czechoslovak government, along with President Bene\u0161, would have found themselves in The Hague.\" His opponent, Milo\u0161 Zeman, seized on the statement to discredit Schwarzenberg, accusing him of being supported by Sudeten Germans."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* Jan Kavan, former President of the United Nations General Assembly, member of the Czech Parliament, former Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic", "* Jan Kavan, former President of the United Nations General Assembly, member of the Czech Parliament, former Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic"]}]}}
