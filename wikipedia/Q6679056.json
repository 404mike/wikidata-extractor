He was a King's Messenger between 1900 and 1909, driving the first motor vehicle into Whitehall Court, carrying foreign dispatches, on 12 November 1902, and carrying the Anglo-Russian Entente from Saint Petersburg to London in 1907. In 1908 he offered a gold cup to the first airman to fly the English Channel, and this trophy was won by Louis Bl\u00e9riot in 1909. Two weeks later, on 10 August 1909, Hubert Latham flew a letter addressed to Windham from France to England, believed to be the first letter ever transported by air. Windham controlled the first aerial meeting in England, held at Doncaster; and at Bournemouth, in 1910, he entered a monoplane and a biplane which he had constructed, winning a prize in the competition."]}, {"page": "William White (journalist)", "response": ["The Times claimed that William White's radical politics alienated many of his clients and thereby ruined his business, as a result of which he ran up debts. Lord Charles Russell therefore secured for him the appointment of assistant, later principal, door-keeper of the House of Commons. He was then in a position, for twenty-five years, between 1850 and 1875, to use his ringside seat in order to gather material to write weekly sketches of parliamentary life for the popular weekly Illustrated Times, which he entitled The Inner Life of the House of Commons. These sketches draw a vivid picture of many notable parliamentary personalities and events of the period. A selection of his parliamentary sketches was published posthumously, in 1897, by Justin McCarthy, the Irish nationalist MP, in a work entitled The Inner Life of the House of Commons.William White, The Inner Life of the House of Commons, edited with a preface by Justin McCarthy, MP, London, T.
