It is in the late decorative to early perpendicular style and its design is probably influenced by George Frederick Bodley; the clerestoried nave with side aisles is long and the chancel high. The interior is faced with smooth grey ashlar with Bath stone decoration, and the nave is well-lit by the large, high-positioned east windows. The nave has an open timber roof while the chancel has a painted and panelled ceiling. The chancel floor is tiled in green and white.
