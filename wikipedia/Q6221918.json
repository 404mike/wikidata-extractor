Tippett was never a formal pupil, but has acknowledged a deep debt to Bush. Herbert Murrill, a pupil of Bush's at the RAM in the 1920s, wrote in 1950 of his tutor: \"[T]here is humility in his makeup, and I believe that no man can achieve greatness in the arts without humility ... To Alan Bush I owe much, not least the artistic strength and right to differ from him\".Murrill, p. 19 Among postwar Bush students who later led distinguished careers are the composers Edward Gregson, Roger Steptoe, E. Florence Whitlock, and Michael Nyman, and the pianists John Bingham and Graham Johnson. Through his sponsorship of the London String Quartet Bush helped launch the careers of string players such as Norbert Brainin and Emanuel Hurwitz, both of whom later achieved international recognition."]}, {"page": "Ronald Brautigam", "response": ["Born in Amsterdam, Brautigam studied there with Jan Wijn (1971-79), then he left to study in London with John Bingham (1980-82) and in the United States with Rudolf Serkin (1982-83).
