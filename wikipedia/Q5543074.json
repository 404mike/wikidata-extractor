Some frescoes and a fireplace surround dating from  the middle of the 16th century were discovered when the house was demolished which suggests there may have been an earlier building In 1630 the house came into the occupation of Joyce Countess of Totnes (1562\u20131637), widow of George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes, who died 1629. She died in 1637, and the house was purchased by  Sir Thomas Lawley, 1st Baronet (1586\u20131646) in 1638. After his death in 1646, the estate remained by the family until it was sold in 1657 to  Sir Joseph Ashe, 1st Baronet (1617\u20131686). He was succeeded in 1687 by his son Sir James Ashe, 2nd Baronet (1674\u20131733). The baronet died in 1733, leaving an only daughter Martha, who had married Joseph Windham (1683\u20131746), who adopted the name Windham Ashe to succeed to the property.  He enlarged the house and built the west front. After his death in 1747 Martha stayed at the house for two years until her death in 1749, when it was bought by  Valens Comyn MP for Hindon. He died two years later and the estate was acquired by Richard Owen Cambridge (1717\u20131802), a celebrated poet. After he died in 1802 the house was occupied by his daughter Charlotte, and then in 1823 by his son George Owen Cambridge (1756\u20131841), who was an archdeacon. "]}]}}
