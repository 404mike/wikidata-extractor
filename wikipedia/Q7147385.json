Some records, notable among them The Times, give his name as O'Halloran.\nIn 1924 he advanced to the second round of the welterweight class after winning his fight against Ren\u00e9 Dubois of France on points. The matches were held in the Veledrome d'Hiver. In the next round, O'Hanrahan was defeated by Jean Delarge of Belgium who won the gold medal in this weight class. It was O'Hanrahan's only Olympic appearance.The decision was not without its controversy as was the case with the boxing decisions against the British as a whole (not to mention fencing), according to The Times. \"O'Halloran is universally considered by our men to have been very unlucky to have had the verdict given against him in a fight against a Belgian yesterday.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
