Approximately fifty athletes were expected to compete; the exact number depended on how many nations used universality places to enter athletes in addition to the 45 qualifying through time or ranking (1 universality place was used in 2016). 47 competitors from 27 nations competed. Jakob Ingebrigtsen set a new Olympic record on his way to the gold medal, Norway's first medal in the men's 1500 metres. Timothy Cheruiyot of Kenya took silver, returning that nation to the podium for the first time since a four-Games medal streak ended in 2008. Josh Kerr earned bronze, Great Britain's first medal in the event since 1988.", "After the runners sorted themselves out at the start of the final, Jakob, the only Ingebrigtsen in the race, moved around the pack to take the lead and press the pace. Cheruiyot moved himself up from mid pack to mark Ingebrigtsen.  The first lap was completed in 56.2. Then Cheruiyot moved to the front to press the pace further. The race was in a single file line, Stewart McSweyn and Ollie Hoare next in line, Abel Kipsang on the outside trying to get past the two Australians. Second lap 1:51.8, a 55.6 by Cheruiyot. Hoare began moving backward, Jake Wightman came forward to race Kipsang. A gap formed between the lead group of Cheruiyot, Ingebrigtsen and McSweyn, with Kipsang leading the line of chasers. Through the penultimate turn, McSweyn couldn't keep up and the leaders were two. Lap 3 2:47.3, a 55.5. Ingebrigtsen glued to the back of Cheruiyot. Josh Kerr chasing Kipsang for bronze. Through the final turn, Ingebrigtsen moved up on Cheruiyot, then past. Cheruiyot looked back to see who else was going to try to pass him, an obvious sign he had nothing more to offer to chase Ingebrigtsen.  Ingebrigtsen opened up a four metre gap before crossing the finish line. Kerr got past Kipsang and chased Cheruiyot to the finish, leaning at the line still didn't quite snatch silver.

From the gun, Cheruiyot and his Kenyan teammate Ronald Kwemoi went out hard, breaking away by 2 metres in the first 200.  The guys who usually drop to the back realized this was serious and started scrambling to the front.  Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz Jr. and silver medalist Taoufik Makhloufi formed a chase group 5 metres back, Jakob Ingebrigtsen leading the peloton another 5 metres back.  Over the next lap, the chasers fell back to the peloton, the breakaway now 10 metres.  Cheruiyot kept up the pressure, over the next half lap, Kwemoi fell off his back.  By the bell, Kwemoi was back to the peloton, again led by Makhloufi.  The next on the front were Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr.  It appeared a more mature 23 year old Cheruiyot had learned from his fast early pace at the 2015 World Relays where he fell apart on the last lap.  Here, there was no sign of letting up.  Down the backstretch, coming from 9th place, Marcin Lewandowski ran around the outside of the pack, hitting Makhloufi's shoulder by the beginning of the final turn.  The other competitors were already fully extended and couldn't make any dramatic moves.  Cheruiyot crossed the finish line 17 metres ahead of Makhloufi.  Lewandowski was able to stay a metre behind Makhloufi, trying to nudge ahead in vain at the finish line.
