Past experiences include Art Director of i-D and Creative Director of Sleazenation magazines, for which he was awarded 'Best Cover' and 'Best Designed Feature of the Year' prizes. King occasionally produces work under the banner 'CRASH!' with writer and historian Matt Worley.King\u2019s work has been exhibited widely in London, New York and European galleries including the ICA, KW Berlin, Portikus, White Columns, Kunstverein Munich and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Disco 3", "response": ["* Scott King \u2013 sleeve art direction, design"]}, {"page": "Tonight You Are the Special One", "response": ["The album cover was designed by Scott King and depicts two cars feeding each other exhaust fumes via a hose in a visual metaphor for corporate suicide. Promoted by a national tour and the singles \"The SAS and the Glam That Goes with It\", \"Come Taste My Mind\" and \"Universal Plan\", the latter two of which charted on the UK Singles Chart, Tonight You Are the Special One was another critical success but commercial disappointment for Earl Brutus, who subsequently split up. As the group rose in stature in the years following their dissolution, Tonight You Are the Special One was re-released alongside the group's debut in 2016 by Loop 3 Music in a new remastered version containing bonus material.", "The album cover was designed by Scott King and depicts a set of BMW and SUV cars parked besides each other, passing exhaust fumes into one another via a long hose in a visual metaphor for what King called a \"yuppie suicide pact.\" Sanderson described the image as depicting 'corporate suicide', commenting: \"You walk around London and you see all these bloody off-road great big four-wheel drive things, and all they bloody do is go from bloody Twickenham to the city. So we liked the idea of a corporate suicide pact \u2013 it's quite upbeat really. Doing everyone a favour.\" After the album's vinyl reissue, Radio X ranked the album cover at number 45 in their list of \"The Top 50 Vinyl Album Cover Sleeves of 2016.\"", "Scott King also designed the artwork for the album's singles. The sleeve of \"The SAS and the Glam That Goes with It\" features a photograph of a woman from Skipton with a moustache. The band picked the photo due to its direct yet odd style and \"cartoon\" nature. The \"Come Taste My Mind\" sleeve features a man in a bra. Jamie Fry had wanted to use a different Scott King photograph of a tin of soup, but a marketer at Island refused. Compromise was reached when the label instead placed similar tins of soup on counters in record shops across Britain as a means of promotion. As part of his Britlins exhibition, Scott King created the post-postmodern installation piece You Are Your Own Reaction (2018), referencing a line from Earl Brutus' \"The SAS and the Glam That Goes with It\".", "*Scott King \u2013 design"]}, {"page": "KW Institute for Contemporary Art", "response": ["Artists: Franz Ackermann, Dennis Adams, Bettina Allamoda, Eleanor Antin, Thomas Bayrle, Sue de Beer, Ulrich Bernhardt, Joseph Beuys, Dara Birnbaum, Klaus vom Bruch, Erin Cosgrove, Lutz Dammbeck, Christoph Draeger, Felix Droese, Heinz Emigholz, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Peter Friedl, Johan Grimonprez, Rudolf Herz, J\u00f6rg Immendorff, Johannes Kahrs, Scott King, Scott King/Matt Worley, Martin Kippenberger, Rainer Kirberg, Astrid Klein, Andree Korpys/Markus L\u00f6ffler, Bruce LaBruce, Claude L\u00e9v\u00eaque, Theo Ligthart, Jonathan Meese, Michaela Meise, Michaela Meli\u00e1n, Klaus Mettig, Olaf Metzel, Rob Moonen/Olaf Arndt, Hans Niehus, Marcel Odenbach, Sigmar Polke, Yvonne Rainer, Gerhard Richter, Thomas Ruff, Thomas Sch\u00fctte, Katharina Sieverding, K.R.H.
