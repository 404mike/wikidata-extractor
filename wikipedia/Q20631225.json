She attended Whitcliffe Mount School,  and read English at Girton College, Cambridge, graduating from Cambridge University in the mid-1980s. Holden moved to London where she found work in the magazine business, eventually working for The Diplomat monthly, where she became an editor, and from there, she moved on to The Sunday Times. One of her responsibilities at the title was ghostwriting a column on behalf of socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, an experience which Holden says influenced her first novel, Simply Divine.Simply Divine was published in 1999, and Holden went on to write a series of novels, most of which were bestsellers, and which she happily describes as \"chick lit\" and \"supermarket novels\".Holden is married, has two children, and, as of 2015, lives in the Derbyshire Peak District.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wendy", "response": ["* Wendy Holdener, Swiss alpine skier", "* Wendy Holden (author, born 1961), British journalist and author", "* Wendy Holden (author, born 1965), British chick-lit novelist"]}, {"page": "Holden (surname)", "response": ["* Wendy Holden (author, born 1961), British journalist and author", "* Wendy Holden (author, born 1965), British author of humorous novels"]}, {"page": "Wendy Holden (author, born 1961)", "response": ["Wendy Holden (born 1961), also known as Taylor Holden, is an author, journalist and former war correspondent who has written more than thirty books.
