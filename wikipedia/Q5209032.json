From that match until the outbreak of the Second World War, Hughes was an ever-present in the Welsh side. He also played in 14 of Wales' 17 wartime and Victory internationals, and later captained the team during the 1947 British Home Championship. In 1944 he toured France and Belgium with an FA Combined Services XI. On 25 November 1944, at Hillsborough, he also played for a Royal Air Force XI in a 7\u20131 defeat against Scotland.

He made shy of 50 league appearances in four seasons at Kenilworth Road, before moving to the top flight with Huddersfield Town in 1934. He was used sparingly before joining First Division rivals Brentford in March 1937 as a replacement for Dai Richards. He quickly became a regular with the Bees, playing in both full back positions, at half back and centre forward during the two-and-a-half years before the Second World War intervened. Brown remained with Brentford during the war, with his 246 appearances being the most by any Brentford player during wartime. He dropped down to the Fourth Division to sign for Leyton Orient in May 1947, before ending his career in the Southern League with Chingford Town the following year."]}, {"page": "1937\u201338 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-four players made at least one appearance in nationally organised competition, and there were thirteen different goalscorers.

Dearson and Charlie Wilson Jones were joint leading scorers with nine goals, all scored in the league. This was the last season under the chairmanship of Howard Cant, who first took office in 1911. He was succeeded by Harry Morris, son of the former player and director, also called Harry Morris."]}, {"page": "Herbert Watson (footballer)", "response": ["Watson signed for Third Division South club Brentford in May 1932, joining former Middlesbrough teammates Jack Holliday and Billy Scott at Griffin Park.

After the signing of Dai Richards, Watson lost his place in the team and managed just 13 appearances in the First Division during the 1935\u201336 season (in which Brentford secured their highest-ever league placing of fifth).

Robson contributed to the Bees' elevation to the First Division for the first time in the club's history, helping the club to the Third Division South title in 1933 and scoring 10 goals in 27 games to send the club to the top flight as Second Division champions in 1935. That same year, he also won the London Challenge Cup with the reserve team. Once in the First Division, the signings of Dai Richards and Dave McCulloch pushed Robson out of the starting line-up and he made just 18 appearances during the first half of the 1935\u201336 season, before departing in the Bees December 1935.

Five goals in a six match spell also saw forward Billy Scott win an England cap in a British Home Championship match versus Wales in October 1937, which made him Brentford's first full England international player.
