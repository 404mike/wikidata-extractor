H. Bullen, (9 February 1857, London \u2013 29 February 1920, Stratford-on-Avon) was an English editor and publisher, a specialist in 16th and 17th century literature, and founder of the Shakespeare Head Press, which for its first decades was a publisher of fine editions in the tradition of the Kelmscott Press. \n\nHis father George Bullen (d. 1894) was librarian at the British Museum. A. H. Bullen's interest in Elizabethan dramatists and poets started at the City of London School, before he went to Worcester College, Oxford to study classics. His publishing career began with a scholarly edition of the Works of John Day in 1881 and continued with series of English Dramatists and a seven-volume set of Old English Plays, some of which he had discovered in manuscript and published for the first time. He was also the first person to publish some early lyric poems. Bullen wrote more than 150 articles for the Dictionary of National Biography, lectured on Elizabethan dramatists at Oxford University and taught at Toynbee Hall.\nIn 1891 he and H. W. Lawrence went into partnership as the publishers Lawrence & Bullen. This lasted until 1900 when Bullen moved on to publish as A. H. Bullen. With Frank Sidgwick as partner, he then formed the Shakespeare Head Press and published a collected Shakespeare and collected Yeats from their base in Stratford-on-Avon. Bullen was admired by literary figures like Swinburne and was well known in his time for his enthusiastic scholarship and for rediscovering forgotten works of literature, most notably those of Thomas Campion. Because he modernised as he published, his texts are not used as standard editions by scholars today. After Bullen's death the press was continued by a partnership including Basil Blackwell, the Oxford bookseller. It continues today as an imprint of Wiley-Blackwell, now printing on normal commercial presses.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Burton", "response": ["Though Burton's legacy lies almost exclusively in his authorship of the Anatomy, his Philosophaster has increasingly been examined alongside it. As Murphy observed, Philosophaster \"has received more attention than most of the other surviving examples of university drama.\" Since its first, mid-19th-century publication in Latin, it has been published three more times, twice with original translations into English. In 1930, it was even performed at the University of California. The play has received a mixed reception from modern scholars. Literary critic Martin Spevack dismissed it as \"an obvious and elementary string of transparent sketches\".Quoted in  O'Connell has, however, described it as \"perhaps the most appealing of Burton's Latin works\", he notes that the \"liveliness in its representation of university life\" redeems the \"weak plotting and flat characterization.\" The 19th-century critic of Elizabethan drama Arthur Henry Bullen wrote of it that the philosophasters \"are portrayed with considerable humour and skill, and the lyrical portions of the play are written with a light hand\". Bamborough summed it up as \"not without genuine merit, particularly in the satirical portraits of pretenders to learning.\""]}, {"page": "The Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First", "response": ["The first editor to break the play into scenes was Arthur Henry Bullen.Hook, 65.

Newly corrected by Willyam Bulleyn, the autour thereof. Imprinted at London by Ihon Kingston. Marcii, Anno salutis m.d.lxiiii., black letter. Of this edition only one copy (in the Britwell collection) is known. The words on the title-page, \"newly corrected\", do not necessarily imply that there had been an earlier edition. Other editions appeared in 1573 and 1578. It combines eloquence with humorous anecdotes and satire. Bullein aimed to prescribe remedies against the sweating-sickness, imported from Le Havre in 1564, but to encourage his countrymen in their affliction. The Dialogue consists of a number of separate scenes: the second is between a rich usurer, Antonius, and Medicus, who in the 1564 edition is styled Antonius Capistrinus, but who in later editions bears the name Dr. Tocrub, probably intended for Dr. Burcot (Burchard Kranich), who is satirised in succeeding dialogues.
