One minute later Toulouse's Pelous kicked Munster flanker Alan Quinlan after Quinlan had stood on Pelous' hand. After the intervention of touch judge Nigel Whitehouse, Pelous was shown a yellow card for his part in the incident and sent to the sin bin for 10 minutes. O'Gara kicked Munster's resulting penalty to give his team a 13\u20136 lead after 51 minutes. Three minutes later, Toulouse fullback C\u00e9dric Heymans threw the ball into himself, then kicked ahead before collecting his own kick. He then chipped ahead which Toulouse's Yannick Jauzion kicked once more before wing Yves Donguy grounded the ball to give Toulouse a try. Elissalde converted the try to tie the scores at 13\u201313 after 54 minutes. Pelous returned from the sin-bin in the 61st minute, and four minutes later was penalised yet again for not rolling away in the ruck. O'Gara kicked the penalty which gave Munster a 16\u201313 lead. For most of the remaining time, Munster employed the pick-and-go technique, where the forwards would drive the ball from ruck to ruck in an effort to retain possession and use up time. Munster were penalised in the 78th minute after 17 phases of play; the ball was kicked downfield by Toulouse who counter-attacked. Munster turned the ball over, however, and won a kickable penalty with ten seconds left on the clock. Referee Nigel Owens stopped the clock until the penalty was taken; because of the risk of Toulouse recovering possession, the options of kicking for goal and kicking for touch were ruled out. Instead, Ronan O'Gara tapped the penalty and went into contact. With the ten seconds used up, the ball became unplayable in the collapsed maul, Owens blew the final whistle, and Munster had won 16\u201313.", "Nigel Whitehouse (Wales)"]}, {"page": "2003 Rugby World Cup", "response": ["*  Nigel Whitehouse "]}, {"page": "2012 Six Nations Championship", "response": ["Nigel Whitehouse (Wales)"]}, {"page": "2013 Six Nations Championship", "response": ["Nigel Whitehouse (Wales)", "Nigel Whitehouse (Wales)"]}, {"page": "2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals", "response": ["Nigel Whitehouse (Wales)", "Nigel Whitehouse (Wales)"]}, {"page": "Judgement Day (rugby union)", "response": ["Nigel Whitehouse (Wales)"]}]}}
