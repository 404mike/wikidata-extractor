This requirement was abolished in December 2014, nine months after the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 permitted same-sex marriages. In both England and Wales and Scotland, such an application from a married person requires written consent from the spouse \u2013 the so-called spousal veto. However, applicants in Scotland benefit from a workaround, where it is possible for applicants in Scotland to apply to the sheriff court to have their interim GRC replaced with a full GRC, bypassing the \"spousal veto\". Some parliamentarians, such as Evan Harris, viewed the original requirement as inhumane and destructive of the family. MP Hugh Bayley said in the Commons debate \"I can think of no other circumstance in which the state tells a couple who are married and who wish to remain married that they must get divorced\". Despite this opposition, the government chose to retain this requirement of the Bill. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, David Lammy, speaking for the Government, said \"it is the Government's firm view that we cannot allow a small category of same-sex marriages\". It was suggested in the debates that the number of transgender people who have undertaken gender reassignment and who are currently living in a marriage was no more than 200."]}, {"page": "City of York (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| style=\"background-color: \" | || 1992 || Sir Hugh Bayley || Labour"]}, {"page": "York Dungeon", "response": ["York Dungeon offered free entry to people subject to anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) for the weekend of the 26 May and 27 May 2007.
