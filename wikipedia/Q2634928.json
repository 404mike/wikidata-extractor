The album was written over the summer of 1972 and combined songs that had already been performed live with new material worked out in jam sessions. Recording began in August with John Anthony, but sessions were prone to tension and disagreements. After a short Italian tour, sessions resumed with Dave Hitchcock taking over production duties. The cover was the final Genesis work to be designed by Paul Whitehead, featuring a fox wearing a red dress. Frontman Peter Gabriel wore the dress and a fox's head on stage for the following tour, which gathered press attention and greatly improved the group's profile.", "Genesis recorded Foxtrot in August and September 1972 in London at Island Studios. They were set to record with producer John Anthony, who had worked with them on their new song \"Happy the Man\" earlier in the year, but escalating costs due to the slow progress of completing it caused disagreements among Anthony and Charisma Records, the group's label, so they looked for a new producer. Banks recalled Charisma were anxious for the group to make a hit recording. The group's first choice for producer was Bob Potter, who had worked with Charisma labelmates Lindisfarne with Bob Johnston engineering. The band did not get on with Potter as he disliked their music; he compared Banks's Mellotron opening to \"Watcher of the Skies\" to the soundtrack to the science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey and felt the song was better without it. Around this time, the band put an end to these unproductive sessions and undertook an Italian tour in August 1972 before resuming work on the album the following month. The group tried out Tony Platt as a producer, but this was abandoned owing to personality clashes. Genesis then settled with co-producer Dave Hitchcock and John Burns as engineer, who would continue to work with Genesis on their next three albums. Banks felt Hitchcock was not the best replacement for the job and disagreed with him over the album's sound.", "Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "Script for a Jester's Tear", "response": ["* Dave Hitchcock \u2013 producer (on \"Market Square Heroes\" (Battle Priest version), \"Three Boats Down from the Candy\")"]}, {"page": "Mirage (Camel album)", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "In the Land of Grey and Pink", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "The Snow Goose (album)", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "Waterloo Lily", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "Hitchcock (surname)", "response": ["* Dave Hitchcock, English former record producer"]}, {"page": "Scheherazade and Other Stories", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "Blind Dog at St. Dunstans", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "Live at the Fairfield Halls, 1974", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "Swaddling Songs", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "Curved Air \u2013 Live", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "David Hitchcock", "response": ["* Dave Hitchcock, former record producer"]}, {"page": "Dave Hitchcock (Producer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "David Hitchcock (music producer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Hitchcock"]}, {"page": "David Hitchcock (producer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Hitchcock"]}]}}
