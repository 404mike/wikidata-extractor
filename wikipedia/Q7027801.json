I dunno, you lend some people a fiver, you never see them again.\" For a time Sadowitz was considered part of the alternative comedy movement, but his act proved too objectionable with The Guardian stating that Sadowitz \"shook up the right-on values of the 80s alternative comedy circuit with his willingness to say the unsayable\".
