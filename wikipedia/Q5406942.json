After consultation with London, which was aware that there were no significant British naval forces in the area, Millington-Drake continued to demand that Admiral Graf Spee leave. At the same time, he arranged for British and French merchant ships to steam from Montevideo at intervals of 24 hours, whether they had originally intended to do so or not, thus invoking Article 16. This kept Admiral Graf Spee in port and allowed more time for British forces to reach the area."]}, {"page": "PLUNA", "response": ["The airline was established in September 1936 and started operations the following month, on 19 November 1936.

Millington-Drake wrote in his memoirs that he suggested the airline be named using a memorable acronym, taking SABENA as an example. It was then decided on \"PLUNA\", an acronym for Primeras L\u00edneas Uruguayas de Navegaci\u00f3n A\u00e9rea ().
