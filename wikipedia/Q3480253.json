According to Harrison, the first to conceive of anything like the paradox was Thomas Digges, who was also the first to expound the Copernican system in English and also postulated an infinite universe with infinitely many stars. Kepler also posed the problem in 1610, and the paradox took its mature form in the 19th-century work of Halley and Cheseaux. The paradox is commonly attributed to the German amateur astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, who described it in 1823, but Harrison shows convincingly that Olbers was far from the first to pose the problem, nor was his thinking about it particularly valuable. Harrison argues that the first to set out a satisfactory resolution of the paradox was Lord Kelvin, in a little known 1901 paper,For a key extract from this paper, see Harrison (1987), pp. 227\u201328. and that Edgar Allan Poe's essay Eureka (1848) curiously anticipated some qualitative aspects of Kelvin's argument:", "* Edward Robert Harrison (1987) Darkness at Night: A Riddle of the Universe, Harvard University Press.", "*Edward Robert Harrison (2000) Cosmology: The Science of the Universe, 2nd ed.

A pdf file can be found here . Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift, cosmologist Edward Robert Harrison said, \"Light leaves a galaxy, which is stationary in its local region of space, and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space. Between the galaxy and the observer, light travels through vast regions of expanding space. As a result, all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space. It is as simple as that...\". Steven Weinberg clarified, \"The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of  [here  is the Robertson\u2013Walker scale factor] at the times of emission or absorption, but on the increase of  in the whole period from emission to absorption.\""]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| Edward Robert Harrison || UK USA || 1917 || 2007", "*Edward Robert Harrison (UK/USA, 1917\u20132007)"]}, {"page": "London Metropolitan University", "response": ["*Edward Robert Harrison, astronomer and cosmologist noted for his explanation of Olbers' Paradox"]}, {"page": "Eureka: A Prose Poem", "response": ["Though modern critics have dismissed Eureka for having no scientific worth or merit,Krutch, Joseph Wood.

This book clarified why lack of energy explains the paradox, and lays out how Harrison discovered that Poe's Eureka anticipated this conclusion. A scientific reassessment  of Eureka also underlines that Poe was the first person to conceive a Newtonian evolving universe considering that nothing can stop stars or galaxies from collapsing on each other.Molaro, P. & Cappi, A"]}, {"page": "Edward Harrison", "response": ["*Edward Robert Harrison (1919\u20132007), British astronomer & cosmologist"]}, {"page": "Edward Robert", "response": ["* Edward Robert Harrison (1919\u20132007), British astronomer and cosmologist"]}, {"page": "Edward R.
