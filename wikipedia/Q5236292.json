His 30 years at the county were the joint second longest playing time for the county, level with Charlie Walters and exceeded only by Stewart Lee. Arnold holds the record for the most Minor Counties Championship wickets for Oxfordshire, surpassing David Laitt's record of 670 in 2009. By the end of his career he had 682 wickets."]}, {"page": "Edward Craig (philosopher)", "response": ["Ultimately, Craig decided to pursue a career in academia rather than cricket. Mike Brearley, who played alongside him in the Cambridge University team, described him as \"a better scholar and batsman than I was\". The cricket writer John Arlott included Craig in a list of players he considered had the potential, had they continued with their cricket careers, to have played Test cricket.  Despite the end of his professional cricket career, he did appear for Cambridgeshire in a single List A match against Oxfordshire in the 1st round of the 1967 Gillette Cup, scoring 12 runs before being dismissed by David Laitt.  Cambridgeshire won the match by four wickets, but Craig didn't feature for the county again."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford", "response": ["* David Laitt, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 1998", "response": ["*David Laitt, 67, English cricketer."]}, {"page": "Laitt, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Laitt"]}, {"page": "List of Minor Counties South List A players", "response": ["*David Laitt (1972\u20131973): DJ Laitt"]}]}}
