Shepherdson also had four spells as caretaker manager at Middlesbrough.Originally, only the eleven players who featured in the 4\u20132 win over West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final received medals. Following a Football Association led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to every non-playing squad and staff member, Margaret Shepherdson received a medal on behalf of her late husband from Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009.The flyover road leading to Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium was named Shepherdson Way in honour of his contribution to the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Banks", "response": ["England beat Argentina 1\u20130 in the last eight, with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header; the match was sullied by the first-half sending off of Argentinian midfielder Antonio Ratt\u00edn, who refused to leave the pitch after being dismissed for dissent. In contrast to the previous games, the semi-final against Portugal proved to be a fair contest between two sides of talented players eager to attack from the start of the match. Yet there was panic in the buildup to the game as trainer Harold Shepherdson forgot to buy chewing gum, which Banks used to make his hands stickier and better able to handle the ball, and so Shepherdson had to run to a nearby newsagents to purchase gum as the teams were in the tunnel. Bobby Charlton scored two goals, but Portugal made a strong finish and won a penalty on 82 minutes after Jack Charlton handled the ball in the penalty area. Eus\u00e9bio converted the penalty after sending Banks the wrong way, and the game finished 2\u20131 in England's favour. This was the first goal Banks had conceded for England in 721 minutes of regular play, since giving up Scotland's last goal after 81 minutes of the Home International clash in April. This remained a record for an England goalkeeper until 2021 when it was broken by Jordan Pickford."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 in English football", "response": ["* 14 September 1995 \u2013 Harold Shepherdson, 76, longtime assistant coach for the England national team, a role he held during England's 1966 World Cup victory."]}, {"page": "Shepherdson", "response": ["*Harold Shepherdson (1918\u20131995), English football player and coach"]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C. survival from liquidation", "response": ["The Manager Bobby Murdoch was asked to resign in September 1982 after poor performances, and Harold Shepherdson was appointed caretaker until a permanent replacement could be installed.

Any other result would send Poland through. Being replaced by Norman Hunter in defence and Peters as the skipper for that match, Moore is understood to have asked Ramsey if this meant he was no longer required, to which Ramsey replied: \"Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year.\" It never happened, as England could only draw 1\u20131. During the Wembley match, Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost it, a similar error to Moore's lost possession in Chorz\u00f3w, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski blocked numerous English chances. Moore later told how he sat alongside Ramsey on the bench and kept urging him to make a substitution, but Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When Kevin Hector finally did come on for Martin Chivers after 85 minutes Moore could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while Ramsey sat immobile. Moore, later, said to David Miller \"you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, we need someone to go through the middle. He just nodded. We couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. We almost threw him onto the pitch.\" Hunter was in an inconsolable state as he was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side he had taken. England's failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup signalled the end of Ramsey's reign as national team manager when he was sacked six months later.", "He was the first member of the England World Cup winning side to die, the next being Alan Ball 14 years later. Moore was outlived by the squad's trainer, Harold Shepherdson, who died in September 1995, and manager, Alf Ramsey, who died in April 1999.
