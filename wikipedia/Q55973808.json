Starkey suggested that people should not \"go on about\" slavery because it had been abolished in 1833, and said: \"Slavery was not genocide, otherwise there wouldn't be so many damn blacks in Africa or in Britain would there? An awful lot of them survived...\" He had made the same point in a column eight days earlier except without the use of the word 'damn'. Starkey's comments were rebuffed by Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said they were racist and that they serve as \"a reminder of the appalling views that still exist\", and they were widely described as racist in the media. Historian David Olusoga, praised by Starkey in the same broadcast, described the comments as \"truly disgusting. And by the same ridiculous, twisted logic the Holocaust would not be counted as a genocide\".", "On 25 September 2020, the Metropolitan Police opened an investigation into the interview over an allegation of a public order offence. In October, Starkey was investigated by the police for 'stirring up racial hatred' through the comments he made in the podcast with Darren Grimes. In regards to the allegations, Starkey said that he did not \"intend to stir up racial hatred and there was nothing about the circumstances of the broadcast which made it likely to do so\"  and said the investigation by the police was \"neither proportionate nor in the best interests of preserving proper freedom of expression\"."]}, {"page": "Consett", "response": ["*Darren Grimes (born 1993), political commentator"]}, {"page": "Television licensing in the United Kingdom", "response": ["In June 2020, a campaign called \"Defund the BBC\" was founded by James Yucel, a student at Glasgow University, supported by political commentator and activist Darren Grimes.

Anti-Brexit campaigner and Labour peer Lord Adonis said: \"It sounds to me as if the Electoral Commission has not been doing its job properly. On the face of it, it seems to have been extremely incompetent.\" An Electoral Commission spokesperson said it welcomed the court's \"consideration of this aspect of electoral law\" and said it had reached the same conclusion as a subsequent commission investigation, which resulted in fines being issued to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes. Vote Leave appealed against the fine, maintaining that the donation to Grimes had been appropriately signed off by the Electoral Commission, but on 29 March 2019 they announced that the appeal had been dropped, citing a lack of financial resources as the reason.

The EHRC periodically intervenes in legal action against discrimination, including a case where a job offer was withdrawn because the woman was pregnant. Butcher's views on feminism and the gender pay gap have been criticised as incompatible with her EHRC role; the pay gap is a major focus for the EHRC, which takes legal action against employers that fail to report gender pay gaps for their workforces. Her appointment was criticised by Sam Smethers, (then) chief executive of the Fawcett Society, and British historian Kate Williams. However, figures such as fathers' rights group Fathers4Justice and Brexit activist Darren Grimes have supported her appointment to the role."]}]}}
