A deep-lying playmaker, he has been praised for his vision and ball distribution skills. However off the field he has struggled to control drink and gambling problems.\nHe started his career with Crewe Alexandra in 2003, and made 133 league and cup appearances over the next five years. In 2008, he had a loan spell at Yeovil Town, before he joined the club permanently the following year. He signed with Rotherham United in November 2009, having impressed on trial, before he was released in summer 2010. Crewe, Yeovil and Rotherham all cited disciplinary problems as their reason for letting him go. He joined Port Vale in July 2010, having been handed a 'last chance' by manager Micky Adams. His contract was terminated in December 2011, again due to a disciplinary issue, and he signed with Mansfield Town. In January 2013 he joined Maltese club Floriana on loan. He spent a short period out of the game before he joined Welsh Premier League side Gap Connah's Quay in January 2014. He returned to Malta with Mosta in January 2015, coming back to England later in the year to play for Witton Albion. He joined Welsh club Bangor City in June 2016, and then switched to Southport in July 2017. He joined hometown club Chester six months later, where he spent close to three seasons, before joining Congleton Town in July 2021.\nIn addition to his domestic career, he has also represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18 and under-19 levels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Gannon", "response": ["Losing four of his first five games in charge, Gannon was forced to respond to criticism over his team selections and substitutions, and announced plans to expand the club's non-playing staff. On 1 February the players met with the Chairman and rumours spread that Gannon had 'lost the dressing room', as comparisons were made with the tenure of Brian Clough in The Damned United. Yet the next day an O'Shea volley gave Vale a 1\u20130 win over promotion rivals Rotherham United to give Gannon his first win in charge at the club. However tension remained, as proven at the end of the month when it was reported that Gannon left the team bus on a pre-match journey after rowing with assistant manager Geoff Horsfield. Gannon had previously told the press his staff were 'underqualified', though insisted any changes would be 'implemented at a later stage' and that Horsfield was a 'great assistant'. It was later reported in the national media that Horsfield had requested a day off to deal with a family matter, Gannon then granted him permission but subsequently wrote a letter to the board complaining of his conduct. An unnamed director then handed the letter to Horsfield, who confronted Gannon over the issue, brandishing the letter as proof when Gannon denied its existence. This came on the same day that local paper The Sentinel ran an editorial that questioned his loan signings, his decision to drop Gary Roberts and branded his tactics and team selections as baffling. Having returned to the team to steer his side to a 2\u20131 victory over Aldershot, Gannon said \"there's been misrepresentation in the media over my part in this. I'm completely the innocent party\". The club informed Horsfield that he would face a disciplinary hearing, whilst Gannon would not be asked to defend his actions and would merely provide a witness statement. The club took no action, and after Horsfield spent two weeks at home the pair returned to work as before. He continued to exploit the loan market, signing Dominic Blizzard from Bristol Rovers, a midfielder who played under him at Stockport."]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["In building for the 2010\u201311 season, Adams released nine players, and signed Sean Rigg, Stuart Tomlinson, Justin Richards, Ritchie Sutton and Gary Roberts. The season began similarly to the previous campaign, with a 3\u20131 win at Championship side Queens Park Rangers in the League Cup First Round, new signing Richards scoring twice. Five wins in five for September saw Adam's gifted the League Two Manager of the Month award, his team also boasting five clean sheets. He was also handed the award for November, after his team advanced into the Third Round of the FA Cup and rose to the top of the League Two table on the back of five clean sheets in seven games. Departing for his boyhood club at the end of December 2010, he left the club in second position in League Two.", "After losing his job at Bramall Lane, he was immediately offered a three-year contract at former club Port Vale. He signed the contract within days, saying it was time to \"finish the job I started\". Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days before the start of the season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals \u2013 both scoring and conceding \u2013 Adams decided to give his players \"a kick up the backside\" by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Rob Kozluk. He stepped down as a director on 5 November, the day of his 100th game in charge at Port Vale, after former director Stan Meigh withdrew the \u00a350,000 sponsorship he had provided to keep Adams on the board of directors."]}, {"page": "Sean McAllister", "response": ["On 11 January 2019, McAllister joined National League North side Chester.

He ended the 2010\u201311 campaign with seven goals in 41 games for the \"Stags\", who went on to reach the final of the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium. Murray was substituted 18 minutes into extra-time of the final, with the only goal of the game being scored by Darlington with just one minute left to play. He was appointed club captain in August 2011 and signed a new contract three months later. Mansfield won 13 of their last 15 matches of the 2011\u201312 season to qualify for the play-offs.

The strong performances of Anthony Griffith and Gary Roberts left only an unfamiliar wide role for Fraser, and a minority of fans became dissatisfied with his performances on the wing and again began booing the young captain. Micky Adams left the club in December 2010, and was replaced by Jim Gannon. Two weeks into Gannon's reign Fraser left the club by mutual consent so as to find first team football, preferring this option to a loan deal."]}, {"page": "Gary Roberts", "response": ["Gary Roberts may refer to:", "* Gary Roberts (ice hockey) (born 1966), former NHL player ", "* Gary Roberts (footballer, born 1960), Welsh football forward and winger", "* Gary Roberts (footballer, born 1984), English football attacking midfielder ", "* Gary Roberts (footballer, born 1987), English football playmaker", "* Gary Roberts (radio broadcaster) (born 1952), Australian radio broadcaster", "* Gary Roberts (American football) (born 1946), American football offensive guard"]}, {"page": "Gary Roberts (1987 birth)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gary Roberts (footballer, born 1987)"]}, {"page": "Tom Pope", "response": ["Pope spent much of the 2005\u201306 season in the Conference North, playing on loan for Lancaster City and then Stafford Rangers.

The goal would prove to be more important to Griffith himself and the Torquay opposition than to his own club, the fine strike his first in the Football League, and his first in Port Vale colours. It also ended the Gulls' run without conceding a league goal at the 998-minute mark, a club record but not a Football League record.

The loan was extended to three months after he became a key part of Ronnie Moore's back four. In November of that year Geohaghon joined Shrewsbury Town on loan until January, initially to help solve injury troubles to the team's key defenders Ian Sharps and David Raven. The deal was made just hours before kick-off against local rivals Crewe Alexandra. His loan spell ended prematurely, as after only three starts he picked up a knee injury that kept him in the treatment room for two months. In January 2011, Jim Gannon was appointed as Port Vale manager, and he immediately brought Geohaghon to Vale Park on loan until the end of the season. Over the course of just four victories in twelve consecutive games with Geohaghon as a holding midfielder, both he and Gannon became highly unpopular figures with some sections of the Vale support. This culminated in ugly scenes on 19 March, as Geohaghon confronted his detractors following a 3\u20131 defeat at Accrington Stanley's Crown Ground, with his manager leaving the stadium in secret for his own safety. Though Gannon was unpopular with players and fans, fan favourites and star players Gary Roberts and Marc Richards did stand by Geohaghon, calling the abuse he received \"unfair... terrible... not acceptable\" and \"harsh\". Two days later Gannon was sacked. Meanwhile, Geohaghon sought legal advice and claimed his scuffle with supporters came about after he reacted to racial abuse levelled at him by a number of fans. Unable to return to Peterborough by the terms of his loan, and unwilling to return to Vale Park, Geohaghon instead remained at his Birmingham home whilst the Football Association's investigation of racial abuse continued.

Lewis Haldane was rushed into hospital after being bitten by an insect during a training session, forcing him to miss the first half of the season. Adams drafted in Reading winger Abdulai Bell-Baggie as a loan replacement for Haldane, and after an initial one-month period then replaced Bell-Baggie with Milton Keynes Dons loanee Jemal Johnson.", "However tension remained, as proven at the end of the month when it was reported that Gannon left the team bus on a pre-match journey after rowing with assistant manager Geoff Horsfield (who had been appointed by Adams).

After Horsfield was told to stay away from the club for two weeks he was invited back to his assistant role as before, with no disciplinary action taken against either party. As the club fell to seventh in the tale, Gannon made another loan signing by bringing Dominic Blizzard in from Bristol Rovers. Results continued to go against the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3\u20130 at Accrington Stanley, and as a result dropped out of the play-off zone for the first time in the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media \"I don't think the manager likes me and, to be honest, I don't like him\". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon be on his way out. These rumours were proved accurate two days later, as Gannon's departure was confirmed by the club. Loan signing Blizzard also left. Mark Grew took over as caretaker-manager, though following a 2 April defeat to leaders Chesterfield he was forced to admit that automatic promotion was now out of reach. Later in the month Grew released Kristian Cox, before a home defeat to bottom of the table Stockport County on 23 April meant that winning their remaining three games no longer guaranteed them a play-off spot. Their penultimate game of the season was a 7\u20132 mauling of Morecambe, which saw Louis Dodds and Justin Richards score the first hat-tricks at Vale Park since Martin Foyle hit three in 1994.
