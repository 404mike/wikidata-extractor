He has played in the Football League for Morecambe.\nBrodie started his career with Whickham and, after being their top scorer in the 2005\u201306 season, moved to Newcastle Benfield in 2006. He signed for York City in January 2007 and finished 2006\u201307 with one goal and played in the Conference National play-off semi-final. He started 2007\u201308 with only 3 goals in 2007, but finished the season with 14 goals. Early in 2008\u201309, Brodie was loaned to Barrow and scored four goals during a one-month period. He finished the season as York's top scorer with 19 goals and played in their 2009 FA Trophy Final defeat at Wembley Stadium. The 2009\u201310 season saw Brodie play in York's defeat in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium and again finish as top scorer, this time with 34 goals. He joined Crawley Town in August 2010 for an undisclosed fee, and with them he won the Conference Premier title in 2010\u201311.\nHe joined Fleetwood Town on a season-long loan for 2011\u201312, winning a second Conference Premier title in as many seasons. Brodie had loan spells with Morecambe and Grimsby Town over 2012\u201313, and after being released by Crawley joined Gateshead. He was loaned out to Hereford United and Southport, joining the latter permanently in 2014. Having been Southport's top scorer with 14 goals in 2014\u201315, Brodie joined Aldershot Town but finished 2015\u201316 with Stockport County.

Victories over Newport County, Guiseley and Swindon Town saw the club progress to a third round tie at home to Championship side Derby County. They won 2\u20131, and followed it up with a 1\u20130 win at League Two side Torquay United in the fourth round. The fifth round draw saw Crawley face away tie with then Premier League leaders Manchester United, with manager Steve Evans admitting it was 'the tie of his dreams'.

He signed for Conference Premier rivals York City on loan until the end of 2007\u201308 on 31 January 2008, after which he said he was looking to sign for the club permanently in the summer. He scored on his debut, a 2\u20130 home win over Grays Athletic after coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Richard Brodie on 9 February 2008. He started ahead of Brodie in the following matches against Halifax Town and Histon, but struggled during these matches. Cambridge attempted to recall him from his loan in March 2008, but league rules meant that he would not be able to return. He returned to Cambridge following the expiration of his loan spell at York in April 2008, in which he made 13 appearances and scored 2 goals.
