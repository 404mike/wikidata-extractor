This made Thackeray, even with three young children in boarding school, a noted traveller/person of no fixed abode. Thackeray had strong ties to Hampshire, having in 1815 after his father died in India been sent to his grandmother's residence in Fareham for his education, and latterly resided there with his aunt. Having been friended by the elder Charles Anderson-Pelham, 1st Earl of Yarborough, it is hence strongly rumoured that as his father had allowed Thackeray to stay in other property that he owned in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, that after his father's death that Charles Anderson-Pelham, 2nd Earl of Yarborough allowed Thackeray to write Vanity Fair whilst temporarily resident at Rookley Manor.
