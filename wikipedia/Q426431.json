Berendt explained: \"there were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn\". Hawkins biographer John Chilton described the prevalent styles of tenor saxophone solos prior to Hawkins as \"mooing\" and \"rubbery belches.\"  Hawkins cited as influences Happy Caldwell, Stump Evans, and Prince Robinson, although he was the first to tailor his method of improvisation to the saxophone rather than imitate the techniques of the clarinet. Hawkins' virtuosic, arpeggiated approach to improvisation, with his characteristic rich, emotional, and vibrato-laden tonal style, was the main influence on a generation of tenor players that included Chu Berry, Charlie Barnet, Tex Beneke, Ben Webster, Vido Musso, Herschel Evans, Buddy Tate, and Don Byas, and through them the later tenormen, Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, Flip Phillips, Ike Quebec, Al Sears, Paul Gonsalves, and Lucky Thompson.

He once joked that due to the amount of time spent in underground air-raid shelters people in London were becoming troglodytes, and he took up this word for one of his early jazz bands, Wally Fawkes and the Troglodytes. After the group disbanded Fawkes adopted \"Trog\" as his pen-name. In 1947, he took a weekly course at the Camberwell School of Art in London where fellow students included Humphrey Lyttelton and Francis Wilford-Smith.  Fawkes had been a member of George Webb's Dixielanders, a semi-professional revivalist jazz band that featured Lyttelton on trumpet, since 1944. When Lyttelton left the Dixielanders in January 1948 to form his own jazz band, Fawkes went with him and stayed with the band until 1956, by which time it had evolved from revivalism to mainstream jazz. This suited Fawkes, as his own bands from then on could be broadly described as mainstream.  He re-united with Lyttelton periodically thereafter, and, though highly talented on his instrument, remains (in the best sense of the term) an \"amateur\". He has long admired Sidney Bechet and once recorded with him, as part of Lyttelton's band, in 1949.
