Around 1770, scandal sheets appeared in London, and in the United States as early as the 1840s. Reverend Henry Bate was the editor of one of the earliest scandal sheets, The Morning Post, which specialized in printing malicious society gossip, selling positive mentions in its pages, and collecting suppression fees to keep stories unpublished.  Other Georgian era scandal sheets were Theodore Hook's John Bull, Charles Molloy Westmacott's The Age, and Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. William d'Alton Mann, owner of the scandal sheet Town Topics, explained his purpose: \"My ambition is to reform the Four Hundred by making them too deeply disgusted with themselves to continue their silly, empty way of life.\" Many scandal sheets in the U.S. were short-lived attempts at blackmail. One of the most popular in the States was the National Police Gazette."]}, {"page": "Westmacott", "response": ["*Charles Molloy Westmacott, (1788\u20131868), British journalist and author"]}, {"page": "John Lade", "response": ["Lade wagered heavily on horses, and on inconsequential feats of skill; he once bet a thousand guineas against the Duke of QueensberryJohn Robert Robinson, Old Q': A Memoir of William Douglas, Fourth Duke of Queensberry, London, 1895.
