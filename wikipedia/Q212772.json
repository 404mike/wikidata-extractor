It was also compared to \"an early-1990s rave record.\" \"Love Machine\", the second single, follows.  The Guardian called the song a \"perfect example of Xenomania's uniquely rousing approach to pop.\" It was called \"three and a half minutes of pure joy, taking in a guitar line that sounds like it's been nicked from an old rockabilly tune, some mid-'80s synth pop and a rousing chorus.\" A cover of The Pretenders' \"I'll Stand by You\" was recorded especially for Children in Need. The first version of \"I'll Stand by You\" that Xenomania created was described as a \"weird, modernist breakbeat version\", which was scrapped upon deciding an updated version of the original song would be better suited for Children in Need. Critics felt it was \"arguable whether this cover adds much to the Pretenders' original.\" Girls Aloud's version has also been compared to Shakespears Sister. \"Jump\", a cover of a song by The Pointer Sisters, was originally taken from the re-release of Sound of the Underground and the soundtrack to Love Actually. Cheryl Cole noted in Girls Aloud's 2008 autobiography Dreams That Glitter \u2013 Our Story that the single \"was the point when we realized everything we'd been doing was quite down and moody [...] and that's not what people wanted.\" The album's fifth track is its final single \"Wake Me Up\". The Guardian's review said that the song sounds like what would happen if \"you married an alarmingly fast techno thud to an implausibly dumb three-chord garage-rock riff.\"", "\"Deadlines and Diets\", originally released in 2000 by Moonbaby (a pseudonym of Xenomania songwriter Miranda Cooper), is a song about one night stands. The song received comparisons to All Saints, specifically their breakthrough single \"Never Ever\". \"Big Brother\", co-written by Cheryl Cole, was labelled \"crunchy electro.\" It was noted that the song \"could be about anything, up to and including the admittedly unlikely topic of sexual subservience to a totalitarian dictator.\" The \"voyeur-themed\" song was compared to ABBA, New Order and the Thompson Twins by one reviewer. \"Hear Me Out\" was co-written by Sarah Harding. The ballad received comparisons to those of the Spice Girls. One of the album's most noteworthy songs, \"Graffiti My Soul\", was intended for Britney Spears's In The Zone. It was turned down for its lack of a chorus; Higgins said that they wanted \"essentially \"Sound of the Underground 2\". The track was described as \"a full-scale collision between Madonna, Michael Jackson and the Prodigy\" and \"frighteningly sharp and sassy.\" The Guardian said the song makes you question: \"What if the Prodigy hadn't turned down the chance to write with Madonna?\" \"Real Life\", the album's tenth track, \"unexpectedly evokes Martina Topley-Bird's Tricky tracks.\""]}, {"page": "The Record of the Year", "response": ["|Cheryl Cole"]}, {"page": "Sound of the Underground (album)", "response": ["The original UK edition of the album featured two bonus tracks. \"Love Bomb\", another Betty Boo collaboration, was compared to Boo's \"Where Are You Baby?\". \"Everything You Ever Wanted\" borrows its opening line from The Rolling Stones.

Three new songs appeared instead. \"Jump\", a cover of song \"Jump (for My Love)\" by The Pointer Sisters, was recorded for the soundtrack to Love Actually (2003).

Several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell. Walsh did not initially make it into the group of ten female contestants who were to appear on the show. However, when another contestant was disqualified on a technicality, she found herself on the show. These finalists then took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances which alternated weekly between the girls and boys. Each week, the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the groups emerged. Walsh joined Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts, and Cheryl Tweedy to comprise the new girl group Girls Aloud, formed through the show by a public vote on 30 November 2002.", "Walsh climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Comic Relief in March 2009. The climb, organised by Gary Barlow, was also undertaken by fellow Girls Aloud member Cheryl, Alesha Dixon, Fearne Cotton, Denise Van Outen, Chris Moyles, Ben Shephard, Ronan Keating and Barlow himself.
