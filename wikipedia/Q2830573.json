Great Britain, under Alan Prescott, and boasting world-class backs such as Billy Boston, Mick Sullivan, Jeff Stevenson and Lewis Jones, and a formidable pack, were expected to win with Jacques Merquey's French side a dark horse."]}, {"page": "Great Britain national rugby league team", "response": ["After the 1957 World Cup series in Australia, Alan Prescott's team went to New Zealand and then stopped off in South Africa to play some missionary games. Mixed-race Billy Boston flew home directly and alone, as apartheid was still in force. Both teams regarded the matches as mere exhibitions and engaged in a \"touch\" type of football at Benoni, Gauteng. The British team played with more gusto in the second match at Durban but the French team refused to take the game seriously. Feelings ran high between the two visiting teams after this match with the French players expressing resentment at Britain's sudden volte-face. It was anticipated that the third match at East London, in view of the strained relations now existing between both teams, would prove a thriller. This supposed grudge match did not eventuate, and the series faded out with Britain again winning with consummate ease.", "On Saturday 14 June 1958, Great Britain lost the first Test 25\u20138 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 48 hours later the British Lions played Brisbane team, Britain won 34\u201329, and then remained undefeated throughout the rest of their visit to Australia.

Perhaps the golden era of the club came in the 1960s, as well as more lately in the Super League era. With a galaxy of stars including Tom van Vollenhoven, Alex Murphy, Dick Huddart, Cliff Watson, Ray French and Vince Karalius, the 1960s was a decade of great success for the Saints. In Prescott's first season as coach he lifted the Lancashire League in the 1959\u201360 season. During this decade, the recognisable 'red vee' strip first appeared in 1961 for the final against Wigan. St Helens won this epic 12\u20136, and the kit has since become synonymous with the club. Mick Sullivan joined Saints for \u00a311,000, then a record transfer fee. They won the Lancashire Cup in the 1961\u201362 season, with a 25\u20139 success over Swinton (at Central Park, Wigan) seeing yet more silverware come St Helens' way under the management of Prescott. After his departure in 1962, Stan McCormick led the club to retaining the Lancashire Cup in his first year, again beating Swinton; and St Helens made it a quadruplet of Lancashire Cup successes with wins against Leigh in 1964, and once more Swinton in 1965, the latter success under coach Joe Coan. St Helens won the Western Division Championship under McCormick's rule, beating Swinton 10\u20137. St Helens, under coach Joe Coan, lost the 1964\u201365 Championship final to Halifax at Station Road, Swinton. The 1965 New Zealand tourists appeared at Knowsley Road on Wednesday 15 September. Saints inflicted a 28\u20137 defeat on their visitors, their biggest loss of the tour. A League and Cup double was achieved under Coan in the 1965\u201366 season, whilst they lost the Floodlit Trophy final against Castleford. St Helens were beaten by Wakefield Trinity in the 1967 Rugby Football League Championship Final at Station Road, Swinton on 10 May 1967 by 20 points to 9 in a replay, after a 7\u20137 draw 4 days earlier.

During this period, Vince Karalius played , and was the captain in St. Helens' 12\u20136 victory over Wigan in the 1961 Challenge Cup Final during the 1960\u201361 season at Wembley Stadium, London, on Saturday, 13 May 1961, in front of a crowd of 94,672. The first occasion that he lifted a trophy for the club was in season 1960\u201361 at Central Park, Wigan when St Helens won the Lancashire County Cup by 15\u20139 against Swinton. St. Helens repeated this in the same competition in the following four years (1961\u201362, 1962\u201363 and 1964\u201365 v Swinton and 1963\u201364 v Leigh).", "At 25, Karalius was selected to make the 1958 Tour to Australia \u2013 a tour that would go down in rugby league history. It was during the \"Battle of Brisbane\" in 1958 at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, when Alan Prescott led the Lions to victory with a broken arm that the Karalius \"hardman\" status was well and truly enshrined. With Prescott in agony with a broken arm, Karalius was also in trouble with an injury to his back. Tour Manager Tom Mitchell recalls in his book, The Memories and Sporting Life of Tom Mitchell:"]}]}}
