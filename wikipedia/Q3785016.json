His work included Canzonets to Three Voyces (London: Printed by Thomas Este [etc.], 1608). In recent times it has been published by Stainer & Bell (London, 1923), and recitals and recordings of the music have been made by madrigal groups worldwide.\nYoull was tutor to the four sons of Edward Bacon, who was the third son of Sir Nicholas Bacon. It appears that those four sons were at Cambridge University together; Youll recalls \"what a solace their company was once to you when I nursed them amongst you\". \"Canzonets to Three Voyces\" is dedicated to them.\nHis Canzonets have charm and individuality. His choice of words \u2013 from Sidney, Ben Jonson, Sir John Davies \u2013 indicates a man of taste.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Baroque composers", "response": ["* Henry Youll (1580/1590\u2013?)"]}, {"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["*Henry Youll (born c. 1580/90), his Canzonets to Three Voyces, although clearly the work of an amateur, have charm and individuality"]}, {"page": "Henry youll", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Youll "]}, {"page": "Yule (surname)", "response": ["* Henry Youll (also, Youell) (1608), English madrigalist and composer"]}]}}
