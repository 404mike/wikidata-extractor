He died aged 28 of anaphylactic shock from an insect bite while on a canal holiday.\"His colleagues remember him as someone of engaging diffidence, who would nonetheless hold his own in argument when he was sure he was right (as he usually was),\" wrote John Nelder in Wedderburn's obituary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rothamsted Research", "response": ["*Robert Wedderburn"]}, {"page": "Generalized linear model", "response": ["Generalized linear models were formulated by John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn as a way of unifying various other statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression.
