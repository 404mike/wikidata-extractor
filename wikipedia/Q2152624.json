On Christmas Day that year, he took part in the famous truce with German soldiers which took place in the form of Christmas songs and then a game of football. The battalion was stationed in the trenches near a village west of Lille.Felstead was discharged in 1916 after sustaining an injury at the Battle of the Somme. After demobilization he worked as a civilian at RAF Uxbridge, and later with the General Electric Company.He died in July 2001 at the age of 106 at an old people's home in Gloucester. After his death, he was reported to be the last surviving veteran of the truce. His death also made the News of the World football annual's obituary section when it was published a year later, a rare occurrence for someone who was never employed in football or football journalism.\nAfter Felstead's death, however, it was reported that Alfred Anderson (another participant of the truce) was still living. Anderson died on 21 November 2005 at the age of 109. The last known World War I veteran to have fought in the trenches (Englishman Harry Patch) died on 25 July 2009 aged 111, and the last World War I veteran of any kind from any country (Florence Green) died on 4 February 2012 aged 110.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christmas truce", "response": ["An account by Llewelyn Wyn Griffith, recorded that after a night of exchanging carols, dawn on Christmas Day saw a \"rush of men from both sides... [and] a feverish exchange of souvenirs\" before the men were quickly called back by their officers, with offers to hold a ceasefire for the day and to play a football match. It came to nothing, as the brigade commander threatened repercussions for lack of discipline and insisted on a resumption of firing in the afternoon.Brown (2005) pp. 75\u201376. The unit was the 15th Royal Welch Fusiliers, a battalion of the volunteer New Armies, which were arriving in France in late 1915 and early 1916. Griffith mentions Christmas Day was \"the first time [he] had seen no-man's land\"; his men were possibly also on their first tour in the front line. Another member of Griffith's battalion, Bertie Felstead, later recalled that one man had produced a football, resulting in \"a free-for-all; there could have been 50 on each side\", before they were ordered back.Riley (2017), p. 717 Another unnamed participant reported in a letter home: \"The Germans seem to be very nice chaps, and said they were awfully sick of the war.\"Riley (2017), p. 722; quoting letter published in Wrexham Advertiser, 9 January 1915. In the evening, according to Robert Keating \"The Germans were sending up star lights and singing \u2013 they stopped, so we cheered them & we began singing Land of Hope and Glory \u2013 Men of Harlech et cetera \u2013 we stopped and they cheered us. So we went on till the early hours of the morning\".Riley (2017), p. 720"]}, {"page": "Alfred Anderson (veteran)", "response": ["Bertie Felstead, who died in August 2001 at the age of 106, was originally believed to have been the last survivor of the Christmas Truce.
