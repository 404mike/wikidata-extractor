Roe, the designer. The construction of the triplane followed A.V. Roe's specifications and was the only replica that utilised wing-warping successfully. With a more powerful 90\u00a0hp Cirrus II replacing the 35\u00a0hp Green engine that was in the original design, the Avro Triplane proved to be a lively performer even with a stuntman dangling from the fuselage."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 1966", "response": ["* Peter Hillwood, British test pilot (b. 1920)"]}, {"page": "Hillwood, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Hillwood"]}]}}
