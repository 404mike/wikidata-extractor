The two men signed were of the highest calibre in the shape of Billy Stewart who had thrice been a league runner-up with Preston and record \u00a3400 signing of Jack Southworth from cash strapped Blackburn. Despite two such high profile signings Everton's start to the season proved very inconsistent and was a bench mark for the rest of the season in which they would finish only sixth. The full back partnership of Kelso and Howarth was broken up after the first ten games and played together just three more times as six different combinations including Parry, Lindsay and Arridge were tried in a bid to bring stability in front of Richard William's goal. The half back line of Boyle, Holt and Stewart lasted just three games before John Walker was tried in place of Holt after the 3\u20137 defeat by Derby. Holt was quickly recalled while Kelso, having been moved out of the back line was tried regularly in place of Dickie Boyle at right half in the second half of the season. The expensive signing of Southworth came too late for the first two games of the season in which the forward line, still robbed of Geary started as Latta, Bell, Maxwell, Chadwick and Milward. Alan Maxwell was replaced at centre forward by Alf Milward for the second game with James McMillan coming into the reshuffled front rank before Southworth made the slot his own in the third game with John Bell deputising for three games and Fred Geary, now back from injury stepping in for three. Geary was restricted to just nine appearances all season in every position of the front rank while Maxwell was also unable to get into the side, moving to newly promoted Darwen where his goals were unable to stave off relegation.", "|Fred Geary, Alec Stewart {own goal}"]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|Alec Stewart"]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|Alec Stewart"]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|Alec Stewart"]}, {"page": "Charlie Parry", "response": ["Parry was re-engaged by Everton in December 1892, on wages of \u00a32 per week and returned to the first team in January 1893, when he took over from Jimmy Jamieson at left back for the match at Sunderland.
