Reports by Malcolm Muggeridge, writing in 1933 as an anonymous correspondent, appeared contemporaneously in the Manchester Guardian; his first anonymous article specifying famine in the Soviet Union was published on 25 March 1933.After being banned from re-entering the Soviet Union, Jones was kidnapped and murdered in 1935 while investigating in Japanese-occupied Mongolia; his murder was likely committed by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD. Upon his death, former British prime minister David Lloyd George said, \"He had a passion for finding out what was happening in foreign lands wherever there was trouble, and in pursuit of his investigations he shrank from no risk. ... Nothing escaped his observation, and he allowed no obstacle to turn from his course when he thought that there was some fact, which he could obtain. He had the almost unfailing knack of getting at things that mattered.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1905", "response": ["* August 13 - Gareth Jones, Welsh journalist (d. 1935)"]}, {"page": "1933", "response": ["* March 29 \u2013 Welsh journalist Gareth Jones makes the first report in the West of the Holodomor famine-genocide in Ukraine."]}, {"page": "1935", "response": ["** Gareth Jones, Welsh journalist (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Gareth Jones (1905\u20131935), first to publicise the existence of the Holodomor in the Western world", "*Gareth Jones a.k.a.

In 1932, he received the Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence for his coverage of the Soviet Union's first five-year plan and thus, he was considered the most expert Western journalist to cover the famine. In the article \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\", he responded to an account of starvation in Ukraine and, while acknowledging that there was widespread malnutrition in certain areas of the USSR (including parts of the North Caucasus and Lower Volga), generally disagreed with the scale of the starvation and claimed that there was no famine. Duranty's coverage led directly to Franklin Roosevelt officially recognizing the Soviet Union in 1933 and thus revoked the United States' official recognition of an independent Ukraine.  A similar position was taken by the French Prime Minister Edouard Herriot, who toured the territory of Ukraine during his stay in the Soviet Union. Other Western journalists reported on the famine at the time, including Malcolm Muggeridge and Gareth Jones, who both severely criticised Duranty's account and were later banned from returning to the Soviet Union.", "As a child, Mikhail Gorbachev experienced the Soviet famine in Stavropol Krai, Russia.
