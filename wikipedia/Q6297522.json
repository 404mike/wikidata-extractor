His sister Grace was appointed to the same department at the same time. He tutored students in organ and composition up to PhD level for 27 years. He was known to be generous, sympathetic and encouraging. He had many students from all parts of the world as shown by a crop of flags pinned to a map on his studio wall. They were prepared by correspondence which was unusual if not unique at the time. In teaching composition it seems Burrows had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject and had developed an almost computer like system for keeping all aspects of his craft at his fingertips. One student described Ben as, 'without peer in the teaching of musical theory throughout the country'. Another declared he, 'was a marvellous teacher, as his successes show. A few words from him verbally or scrawled on an exercise, were worth books of others!'  The successes referred to are the qualifications earned by his pupils; 24 D Mus, 56 B Mus and 104 FRCO. Burrows is noted for his development of a system for music typography and founded his own publishing house, Bodnant Press, to publish his music and teaching monographs. He also had skills as a precision engineer and horologist.  Among his prominent music students is the composer Joyce Howard Barrell. Ben's reputation as a major figure on the British music scene was recognised by Leicester City Council who honoured his life and work with a Blue Plaque outside his old studio at 2 University Road. It reads, 'Benjamin Burrows 1891-1966 Composer and Inventor taught in this building.'"]}, {"page": "Joyce Barrell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joyce Howard Barrell"]}, {"page": "Grace Burrows", "response": ["died at age 87.
