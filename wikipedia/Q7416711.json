She remained with the programme for only sixteen editions, the last being shown on 3 September 1962, later that same year, making her one of the programme's shortest-serving presenters (other than stand-ins Ann Taylor, Tony Hart and Sandra Michaels). She voluntarily resigned from the series because of her imminent divorce from the musician Ray Ellington and her own worries of the inappropriateness for a presenter of a children's programme. West never divulged her reasons for leaving to the producers, who deemed her \"unprofessional\" for simply walking out on the show."]}, {"page": "The Ronnie Barker Playhouse", "response": ["**Also starring George A.

However, although Singleton left the series full-time in 1972 to present the spin-off series Blue Peter Special Assignment, she continued to be an occasional presenter until 1975. Singleton's last 'official' appearance on the show came on 20 October 1975 although she was also credited with appearing on the 1975 'review of the year' programme, broadcast on 29 December 1975. She returned to Blue Peter on 16 October 1978 to co-present the live UK TV balloon release for the 20th Anniversary. Singleton presented her last Special Assignment in May 1981, and returned to co-present Blue Peter to moderate the live UK TV link-up to launch the 25th Silver Anniversary balloon hunt on 17 October 1983; these additions make her total presenting span 21 years. Sandra Michaels presented the show twice in April 1964 in the absence of Singleton, and impressed producer Edward Barnes enough that he considered her as a replacement for Singleton; however, Michaels turned this down and he opted to carry on with Singleton, something he admitted in hindsight he was glad he did. The youngest presenter of Blue Peter was Yvette Fielding, who was eighteen when she began presenting, and the oldest was John Noakes, who was forty-four when he left. Only one presenter, Peter Duncan, had two stints of presenting, his first being from 1980 to 1984, and his second being from 1985 to 1986."]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Clint and Mac", "response": ["*Sandra Michaels as Pamela Stuart"]}, {"page": "Template talk:Blue Peter presenters", "response": [": And also Sandra Michaels Dunarc (talk) 19:03, 1 September 2017 (UTC)"]}]}}
