Earlier in his career, he was the guitarist and front-man of numerous bands.  His first recordings to be released were with the Sunderland punk band the Toy Dolls, whom he joined as bassist in 1983.  He toured extensively with them and recorded two singles before forming the Troubleshooters in 1985.  The Troubleshooters released two singles before changing their name to the Smalltown Heroes in 1992. They released a number of singles including the world's first interactive CD-rom single, \"Moral Judgement\", which contained the band's history, the video for \"Moral Judgement\", and gig footage.  \"Moral Judgement\" received the 'Single-of-the-Week' designation from Kerrang magazine on its release in 1994.  It was followed in 1996 by their only album, Human Soup.  In 1998, during the recording of what was planned as their second album, Atomic Cafe, their record company pulled the plug, announcing that they had no more money, causing the band to fold.  In the summer of 1998, Warne formed a retro-rock cover band named Sun Devils.\nIn 2000, Warne was invited to audition for the Stranglers, whom he had met in 1995 when Smalltown Heroes supported them on tour. His audition was successful, and he immediately set off to play in Kosovo and then across Europe with the band. One of their first gigs together was captured on the 2002 Euro Live DVD, recorded in Poland in 2000.\nHe is also well known in the small Northumberland village of Belford, where he played many solo gigs at the Salmon Inn around the time he joined the Stranglers.\nWarne sings lead vocals on many of the tracks contained on the Stranglers' most recent studio albums (Suite XVI, Giants and Dark Matters).  In live gigs, he handles the vocals on the songs that had originally been sung by Hugh Cornwell.\nIn October 2017, Warne played guitar for the track \"21st Century Love\" which features on fellow North East singer/songwriter Scott Michael Cavagan's debut album.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Stranglers", "response": ["In 2000, Ellis left the band and a new guitarist, Baz Warne, was recruited.", "* Baz Warne \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (2000\u2013present), lead vocals (2006\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Toy Dolls", "response": ["For their thirtieth anniversary in October 2009, the band received congratulatory messages from a selection of musicians, including Baz Warne from The Stranglers, TV Smith from The Adverts Jake Burns from Stiff Little Fingers, and NOFX manager Kent Jamieson.", "As of 2007, the band has had fourteen different drummers and twelve different bassists.

Burnel and Louie Nicastro handled instrumentation and arrangements, additional guitars were handled by Baz Warne, and vocals were provided by Burnel and Phillipa Cookman. Burnel was directly invited onto the project by Maeda, who flew to London to ask him in person. Maeda, who was a fan of Burnel's work, explained his artistic vision for the anime, and Burnel agreed to compose. He worked from his own country, then sent the completed themes to Japan, where they were arranged to fit the animation and pace where needed. Additional musical pieces and arrangements were done by Koji Kasamatsu and Reiji Kitazato. The music covers multiple genres, including opera and electronic dance."]}, {"page": "Norfolk Coast (album)", "response": ["Norfolk Coast is the fifteenth studio album by The Stranglers, and was released on 16 February 2004 by EMI's Liberty Records label, making it their first new album recorded for the company in 23 years.

He told Classic Rock Magazine that he has given us his blessing to carry on without him, he's sort of ready to hand over the baton to Jim, our new drummer who's been really welcomed by the fans. I know a lot of the old fans say it's not the same without Jet, and they're absolutely right but there comes a time when you have to ask yourself a simple question; do you want to see The Stranglers without Jet or just accept that you'll never see them again?\"Stranglers Interview \u2013 Baz Warne talks to Louder Than War about their upcoming tour \u2013 Louder Than War.
