It also states that there was a letter \u2018glaring in the center of the painting\u2019 (M) standing for Matrimonio or Mary Magdalene. This speculation originated in earlier books The Templar Revelation (1997) by Lynn Picknett and The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln and Richard Leigh (1982). Art historians hold that the figure is the Apostle John, who only appears feminine due to Leonardo's characteristic fascination with blurring the lines between the sexes, a quality which is found in his other paintings, such as St. John the Baptist (painted  1513\u20131516). Christopher L. Hodapp and Alice Von Kannon comment, \"If he [John] looks effeminate and needs a haircut, so does James, the second figure on the left.\" According to Ross King, an expert on Italian art, Mary Magdalene's appearance at the last supper would not have been controversial and Leonardo would have had no motive to disguise her as one of the other disciples, since she was widely venerated in her role as the \"Apostle to the Apostles\" and was the patron of the Dominican Order, for whom The Last Supper was painted. There would have even been precedent for it, since the earlier Italian Renaissance painter Fra Angelico had included her in his painting of the Last Supper."]}, {"page": "Prince George, Duke of Kent", "response": ["cousin of railroad heiress Gloria Vanderbilt \u2013 was married first to Horace R.

Besides the formal lecture programme, UnCon normally features exhibits by organizations such as the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena and the Centre for Fortean Zoology.
