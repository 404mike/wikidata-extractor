Their unit was posted to the Far East, where they were captured by Japanese forces in Java in 1941 and spent the duration of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp before being released in September 1945. During his time in the camp, Curtis taught Japanese officers how to play football with a ball made out of paper in order to obtain food. The effects of his imprisonment led Curtis to lose nearly half his body weight and his son later remarked how Curtis' wife barely recognised him on his return home. Curtis later attributed his survival to the fitness obtained from his football career."]}, {"page": "Colin Baker (Welsh footballer)", "response": ["He made his debut in a 2\u20132 draw with Sheffield Wednesday on the final day of the 1953\u201354 season and went on to take over from his namesake Billy Baker on a permanent basis and his partnership with Alan Harrington during the 1959\u201360 season helped the Bluebirds win promotion back to the First Division. Very rarely suffering from injuries, in 1965 he became the first Cardiff player ever to be substituted, which had recently been introduced, when he was taken off due to injury during a match against Bury for David Summerhayes.

He joined his hometown club Cardiff City in 1939 at the start of the Second World War.

At the age of 18, James enlisted in the army, joining the 77th HAA Regiment, Royal Artillery. The unit contained a number of footballers including other Cardiff City players Ernie Curtis and Billy Baker and embarked on a journey to North Africa by ship for deployment. However, en route, Japanese forces launched attacks on Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaya leading the UK to declare war against Japan which saw James and his unit rerouted to the Dutch colony of Java in the Dutch East Indies where British forces suffered heavy losses and James was one of numerous British troops taken prisoner."]}, {"page": "Islwyn Jones", "response": ["Born in Merthyr Tydfil, Jones worked in Merthyr Vale Colliery as a teenager while playing football for Troedyrhiw Boy's Club.

Under Jennings, there were signs that the worst was over both on and off the field. The teams' results began to improve over the next two seasons, and in turn; this meant that more fans were coming to Ninian Park to see their team's revival. Industrialist Herbert Merrett took an interest in the club and over a year, acquired control of the club and wiped out its longstanding debts. The 1938\u201339 season saw the debut of a midfielder who would be a prominent member of future City sides; Billy Baker, however a final league position of 13th in the division led new chairman Herbert Merrett to appoint Cyril Spiers as secretary-manager to replace Jennings for the 1939\u201340 season.
