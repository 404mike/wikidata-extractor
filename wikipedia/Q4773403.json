He studied at Oxford and University College Hospital, qualified in medicine in 1949. He worked as a General Practitioner in North London, then directed the University of Sussex Health service, and later worked as a Consultant Psychotherapist in St. Thomas' Hospital, London, from 1983 to 1992. While in general practice he realised that a lot of his patients were presenting with psychological problems or distress, which he confirmed by epidemiological studies. He developed interest in psychotherapy and later developed a time limited therapy which can be offered in the National Health Service.  This type of therapy is known as cognitive analytic therapy.\nIn the 1960s he moved to Kingston, on the outskirts of Lewes, East Sussex with his wife and four children.\nRyle died aged 89 on 29 September 2016. Tony is survived by his second wife, Flora Natapoff, and two stepchildren, Sasha and Sam; by the four children, Martin, Cym, Conrad and Miriam, from his first marriage, to Rosemary (nee Langstaff), which ended in divorce; and by nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Integrative psychotherapy", "response": ["The third route to integration commonly recognized in the literature is theoretical integration in which \"two or more therapies are integrated in the hope that the result will be better than the constituent therapies alone\" (Norcross, 2005, p.\u00a08). Some models of theoretical integration focus on combining and synthesizing a small number of theories at a deep level, whereas others describe the relationship between several systems of psychotherapy. One prominent example of theoretical synthesis is Paul Wachtel's model of cyclical psychodynamics that integrates psychodynamic, behavioral, and family systems theories (Wachtel, Kruk, & McKinney, 2005). Another example of synthesis is Anthony Ryle's model of cognitive analytic therapy, integrating ideas from psychoanalytic object relations theory and cognitive psychotherapy (Ryle, 2005). Another model of theoretical integration is specifically called integral psychotherapy (Forman, 2010; Ingersoll & Zeitler, 2010). The most notable model describing the relationship between several different theories is the transtheoretical model (Prochaska & DiClemente, 2005)."]}, {"page": "Cognitive analytic therapy", "response": ["Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) is a form of psychological therapy initially developed in the United Kingdom by Anthony Ryle. This time-limited therapy was developed in the context of the UK's National Health Service with the aim of providing effective and affordable psychological treatment which could be realistically provided in a resource constrained public health system. It is distinctive due to its intensive use of reformulation, its integration of cognitive and analytic practice and its collaborative nature, involving the patient very actively in their treatment.", "As the name implies, cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) evolved as an integrative therapy based on ideas from cognitive and analytic therapies. CAT was also influenced in part by George Kelly's constructivism.
