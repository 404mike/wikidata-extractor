He accepted command of Chapuy's former division after some reluctance. If many officers received rapid promotion at this time, it was also true that many were soon denounced as traitors and executed. Soon after, Pichegru sent the unit from Cambrai to Sainghin-en-M\u00e9lantois near Lille where it absorbed Pierre-Jacques Osten's brigade, making the division 23,000-strong. On 10 May Bonnaud's division attacked the Duke of York at Marquain, now a western suburb of Tournai. York turned the French right flank at Camphin-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le with three heavy cavalry brigades under David Dundas, Sir Robert Laurie and Richard Vyse. Some of the French cavalry fled but the infantry withdrew without panicking. It was the first time the French infantry formed square with success, driving off British cavalry charges. Finally, artillery firing grapeshot disordered the French squares and the Scots Greys charged, breaking into a square. After this event the cavalry overran two more squares. In the actions at Baisieux and Willems French losses were estimated at 3,000 killed and wounded plus 500 men and 13 guns captured. British losses numbered 245. These combats were part of the larger Battle of Courtrai in which the French emerged victorious."]}, {"page": "Vyse, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Vyse"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1806 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Richard Vyse"]}, {"page": "William Vyse", "response": ["One of his sons, Richard, became a General.'General Richard Vyse', Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 95 Part 2 (1825), p. 180 (Google).'Succession of Colonels: Richard Vyse', in Historical Records of the Third, or Prince of Wales's Regiment of Dragoon Guards (By Command, London 1838), pp. 127-28 (Internet Archive).
