Harry Curtis' longtime assistant Jimmy Bain steadied the ship until Tommy Lawton took over as player/manager in January 1953. An awful start to the 1953\u201354 season led Lawton to resign and the appointment of Bill Dodgin, Sr. failed to improve matters, with Brentford suffering relegation to the Third Division South in May 1954. It was only after the appointment of Malky MacDonald in May 1957 (who had returned to the club after serving as a player and coach under Harry Curtis in the late 1940s) that fortunes changed. Like his predecessors since the Second World War, MacDonald relied on products of the club's youth system. The goals of homegrown forwards Jim Towers and George Francis fired the Bees to 2nd and 3rd-place finishes in the 1957\u201358 and 1958\u201359 seasons respectively, before their sales in 1961 cut off the team's goal supply. The Brentford board also reduced the number of playing staff to 16, with six players being retained on a part-time basis, which led to the club suffering relegation to the Fourth Division in 1962. MacDonald's big money signings of John Dick, Johnny Brooks and Billy McAdams completed an all-international forward line and the team won the 1962\u201363 Fourth Division championship at a canter."]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["Knocked out of both the League and FA Cup by the end of January, Ipswich were left to fulfil their league fixtures which started with them hosting Everton on 3 February 1962.

Although Roy Vernon had scored for Everton, Ipswich's  third goal came after Green fouled Stephenson, whose resulting free kick was converted by Elsworthy.  Crawford made it 4\u20131 from a fine angle before Brian Harris scored a consolation, ending the match 4\u20132.  The following week, Ipswich were at Craven Cottage where they faced Fulham.  Alan Mullery put the home side ahead after 13 minutes as they dominated the early stages, but injuries to Graham Leggat and Johnny Haynes weakened the team allowing Ipswich to take advantage.  Stephenson equalised and Crawford scored the winner with twelve minutes to go, with Ipswich taking the points with a 2\u20131 victory.  After a two-week break, Ipswich faced West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground on 24 February.  Described by Pawson in The Observer as a \"curiously relaxed and gentle game\", John Dick put the home side ahead before Leadbetter equalised with a rebound from a Crawford header which struck the West Ham crossbar.  Bailey spilled Joe Kirkup's strike into his own net to give West Ham the lead once again before a penalty from Phillips secured a 2\u20132 draw.
