Taylor's first signing was Junior Lewis, a  midfielder who joined from non-League club Hendon; he had previously played under Taylor's management at Dover Athletic.  Barry Miller, a defender, also stepped up from non-League football, having last played for Farnborough, and former Port Vale defender Brian McGlinchey also joined the club; both players had been released by their previous clubs at the end of the preceding season but played for Gillingham on a trial basis during pre-season and performed well enough to be offered contracts.  Andy Thomson and Christian Lee, both forwards,  were signed from Oxford United and Northampton Town respectively; Gillingham paid transfer fees of \u00a325,000 for Thomson and \u00a335,000 for Lee.

The team prepared for the upcoming season with a number of friendly matches against non-League teams.

Five minutes into the match, a volley from Swansea's Heggs was tipped over the crossbar by Andy Woodman, the Northampton Town goalkeeper.  In the 25th minute, Jan M\u00f8lby conceded possession to Swansea's Grayson who passed to Parrish, but Christian Edwards blocked his shot.  Early in the second half, John Frain crossed for Christian Lee but his header was off-target.  Later in the half, Frain crossed for Gayle whose header just clipped the Swansea crossbar.  Soon after, Northampton Town were awarded a free kick on the edge of the Swansea penalty area.  Frain struck the ball into the wall but the referee adjudged that the defenders had encroached and ordered the free kick be retaken.  On the second attempt, and in second-half stoppage time, Frain's shot found its way into the back of the Swansea goal, giving Northampton a 1\u20130 lead which they held onto for the last seconds to secure victory and promotion to the Second Division.", "|FW ||10 ||Christian Lee|| ||"]}, {"page": "NATYS: New Acts of the Year Show", "response": ["** Christian Lee - runner-up"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 2 August 1999 || CF ||  || Christian Lee || Gillingham || \u00a335,000 ||"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Christian Lee||FW||||Aylesbury||||57||8||Doncaster Rovers||13 July 1995||Free", "| FW || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Christian Lee"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Christian Lee||FW||||Aylesbury||||38||7||Doncaster Rovers||13 July 1995||Free", "| FW || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Christian Lee"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Christian Lee||FW||||Aylesbury||||38||7||Doncaster Rovers||13 July 1995||Free", "| FW || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Christian Lee"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["|Christian Lee"]}]}}
