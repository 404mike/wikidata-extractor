He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively: he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every day. His favourite actor was Charles Mathews and Dickens learnt his \"monopolylogues\" (farces in which Mathews played every character) by heart. Then, having learned Gurney's system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at Doctors' Commons and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years... This education was to inform works such as Nicholas Nickleby, Dombey and Son and especially Bleak House, whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to \"go to law\".", "In 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.

The play attracted notice, and other performers adopted the style. From at least the 1810s, blackface clowns were popular in the United States. British actor Charles Mathews toured the U.S. in 1822\u201323, and as a result added a \"black\" characterization to his repertoire of British regional types for his next show, A Trip to America, which included Mathews singing \"Possum up a Gum Tree\", a popular slave freedom song.Burrows, Edwin G. & Wallace, Mike.

Stone also asserts that The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices, written in collaboration with Wilkie Collins after their walking tour of Cumberland during September 1857 and published in Household Words from 3 to 31 October of the same year, presents certain strange locations and a passionate love, foreshadowing Great Expectations."]}, {"page": "Arthur Wing Pinero", "response": ["As a junior member of Wyndham's company Pinero quickly gained experience in a range of roles, supporting E.

By the late 18th century, blackface characters began appearing on the American stage, usually as \"servant\" types whose roles did little more than provide some element of comic relief.Lewis Hallam is frequently cited as the first actor to perform in blackface based on an impression he did of a drunken black man in a 1769 staging of The Padlock. Later research by Cockrell and others disputes this claim. Eventually, similar performers appeared in entr'actes in New York theaters and other venues such as taverns and circuses. As a result, the blackface \"Sambo\" character came to supplant the \"tall-tale-telling Yankee\" and \"frontiersman\" character-types in popularity, and white actors such as Charles Mathews, George Washington Dixon, and Edwin Forrest began to build reputations as blackface performers.

Incledon, who had also received instruction from Rauzzini, was decidedly English in his musical outlook and had little time for foreign music, or for people who enthused about songs the words of which they did not understand. The continuing contest between Italian and English styles of composition and singing found an epitome in the materials and style of Incledon and Braham, which, in an age of nationalistic feeling, prompted unworthy anti-semitic commentaries in some quarters against Braham.Thomas Rowlandson, 'Family Quarrels, or, The Jew and The Gentile', in Ruth HaCohen, The Music Libel Against the Jews: Vocal Fictions of Noise and Harmony (Yale University Press, 2012), Fig. 2.4 and pp. 124\u201325.
