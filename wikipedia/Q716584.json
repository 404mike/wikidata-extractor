Hamilton had rudimentary knowledge of Akkadian, which he had learned from Archibald Sayce's 1872 Assyrian Grammar for Comparative Purposes. Hamilton's book relied heavily on Smith's translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh, but also made major changes. For instance, Hamilton omitted the famous flood story entirely and instead focused on the romantic relationship between Ishtar and Gilgamesh. Ishtar and Izdubar expanded the original roughly 3,000 lines of the Epic of Gilgamesh to roughly 6,000 lines of rhyming couplets grouped into forty-eight cantos. Hamilton significantly altered most of the characters and introduced entirely new episodes not found in the original epic. Significantly influenced by Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and Edwin Arnold's The Light of Asia, Hamilton's characters dress more like nineteenth-century Turks than ancient Babylonians. Hamilton also changed the tone of the epic from the \"grim realism\" and \"ironic tragedy\" of the original to a \"cheery optimism\" filled with \"the sweet strains of love and harmony\"."]}, {"page": "Hittites", "response": ["As the discoveries in the second half of the 19th century revealed the scale of the Hittite kingdom, Archibald Sayce asserted that, rather than being compared to Judah, the Anatolian civilization \"[was] worthy of comparison to the divided Kingdom of Egypt\", and was \"infinitely more powerful than that of Judah\".The Hittites: the story of a forgotten empire By Archibald Henry Sayce Queen's College, Oxford.

Adam Smith recommended examinations to qualify for employment in 1776.Smith, Adam, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations Project Gutenberg : (Book V: Chapter I: Part III) In 1838, the Congregational church missionary Walter Henry Medhurst considered the Chinese exams to be \"worthy of imitating.\" In 1806, the British established a Civil Service College near London for training of the East India Company's administrators in India. This was based on the recommendations of British East India Company officials serving in China and had seen the Imperial examinations. In 1829, the company introduced civil service examinations in India on a limited basis. This established the principle of qualification process for civil servants in England.Bodde, Derk, Chinese Ideas in the West Committee on Asiatic Studies in American Education  In 1847 and 1856, Thomas Taylor Meadows strongly recommended the adoption of the Chinese principle of competitive examinations in Great Britain. Both Thomas Babington Macaulay, who was instrumental in passing the Saint Helena Act 1833, and Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh, who prepared the Northcote\u2013Trevelyan Report that catalyzed the British civil service, were familiar with Chinese history and institutions. When the report was brought up in parliament in 1853, Lord Monteagle argued against the implementation of open examinations because it was a Chinese system and China was not an \"enlightened country.\" Lord Stanley called the examinations the \"Chinese Principle.\" The Earl of Granville did not deny this but argued in favor of the examination system, considering that the minority Manchus had been able to rule China with it for over 200 years. In 1854, Edwin Chadwick reported that some noblemen did not agree with the measures introduced because they were Chinese. The examination system was finally implemented in the British Indian Civil Service in 1855, prior to which admission into the civil service was purely a matter of patronage, and in England in 1870. Even as late as ten years after the competitive examination plan was passed, people still attacked it as an \"adopted Chinese culture.\" Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington insisted that the English \"did not know that it was necessary for them to take lessons from the Celestial Empire.\" In 1875, Archibald Sayce voiced concern over the prevalence of competitive examinations, which he described as \"the invasion of this new Chinese culture.\""]}, {"page": "Arabic grammar", "response": ["The schools of Basra and Kufa further developed grammatical rules in the late 8th century with the rapid rise of Islam.Goodchild, Philip.
