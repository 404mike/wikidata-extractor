During his time at Aston Villa, he won the League Cup, the League Championship, the European Cup and the European Super Cup.\nCowans left Aston Villa for the first time in 1985, signing for Bari. He then returned to Aston Villa in 1988 and left again in 1991 moving to Blackburn Rovers. When he left Blackburn he went back to Aston Villa, before moving to Derby County, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Sheffield United, Bradford City, Stockport County and finally Burnley.\nHe was also capped 10 times by England at international level scoring two goals, against Scotland and Egypt. According to former Aston Villa team-mate Derek Mountfield, Cowans was the best two-footed player he ever played with, capable of tough tackling and making spectacular assists. Cowans is consistently rated by Villa fans as one of their 3 best ever players. Cowans returned once again to Aston Villa in a coaching role, first coaching in their youth academy before becoming first team coach and later reserve team manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 27", "response": ["*1958 \u2013 Gordon Cowans, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Aston Villa F.C.", "response": ["Villa achieved a seventh top-flight league title in 1980\u201381, with players such as Gordon Cowans, Tony Morley and captain Dennis Mortimer leading the club to its first top-flight title in 71 years. To the surprise of commentators and fans, Ron Saunders quit halfway through the 1981\u201382 season, after falling out with the chairman, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 1\u20130 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal. The following season Villa were crowned European Super Cup winners, beating Barcelona 3\u20131 on aggregate. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s, due to financial mismanagement Saunders' team was broken up, culminating in relegation in 1987, just five years after being crowned European champions.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 148.

It was announced on 18 September 2010 that Gary McAllister had agreed to become his assistant manager, with Gordon Cowans also taking a role in Houllier's backroom staff. Two days after the Blackburn match, he signed a three-year contract. However, Houllier's start at the club proved to be difficult. The side was hit with injuries to key players Gabriel Agbonlahor, Stiliyan Petrov, Nigel Reo-Coker and Emile Heskey, and managed just one win in ten Premier League matches. In November 2010, Houllier signed 37-year-old former Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires on a free transfer in an attempt to aid the club during its injury crisis. By January 2011, Villa had picked up just 21 points from 20 Premier League matches. The club had also been knocked out of the League Cup the previous month by local rivals Birmingham City. On 5 January, Villa were beaten 1\u20130 at home by Sunderland; this loss left Villa in 18th position in the league table, the first time they had been in the relegation zone since 2003. During the match, a selection of the home crowd targeted Houllier with chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" to vent their frustration at the club's poor run of form.
