This spans the period between first matches to have been given retrospective first-class status in 1772 to the formation of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1787. A total of 67 first-class matches were played during this period.\nCricket during this period became increasingly similar to the modern game, although bowling remained underarm until the 19th century. The first Laws of Cricket had been established in 1744 and in 1774 a revision of the Laws added Leg before wicket as a mode of dismissal. The third stump was added after 1775.Cricket scorecards became increasingly complete from 1772 onwards and the players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1772 and 1786 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Page (surname)", "response": ["Page is an occupational surname derived from page.
