He was released at the end of the season, and by July was playing for Cape Town City of the South African National Football League. He was a member of the team that lost to Durban City in the final of the 1965 UTC Bowl, and remained a regular in the side, either at wing half or in the forward line, for the next two seasons."]}]}}
