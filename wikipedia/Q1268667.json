Williams received his doctorate in 1978 from Oxford University, writing on the work of the Antiphon Painter. He joined the Department of Antiquities at the British Museum in 1979. From 1993 to 2007, he was the museum's Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities. Since December 2007 he has been the research Keeper.Williams' main research areas are the collections of Attic vase painting, and ancient Greek metalwork as well as questions of history. He has been a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Warren Cup", "response": ["One side of the Warren Cup depicts a \"bearded man\" and a \"beardless youth\" engaging in anal sex in a reclining position, with the youth lowering himself using a strap or sash to be penetrated. A boy watches from behind a door.Pollini 1999, p. 29; Craig A. Williams, Roman Homosexuality, 2nd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 101-2. Dyfri Williams speaks of a \"senior, bearded figure\" and a \"beardless youth,\" both \"males\" (Williams 2006, pp. 7, 11). The two figures do not appear to be a great difference in age and are of a similar size. The apparent weight of the upper figure, as he lowers himself onto his lover's penis using the support, makes this a non-traditional passive role. The use of a strap or support during sex can be found in other Greek and Roman artworks, a close example being an erotic cup by Onesimos where a woman spreads her legs in anticipation while grasping a strap with her left hand.", "The other side depicts another scene of anal sex, between a \"beardless\" and clean-shaven \"young man\" and a smaller figure with long hair indicating he is a \"boy\" or \"adolescent\" (now the \"eromenos\").Pollini 1999, p. 29, using \"adolescent\"; C. A. Williams, Roman Homosexuality, p. 102, using \"boy.\" Dyfri Williams uses the terms \"beardless youth\" and \"boy,\" respectively (Williams 2006, p. 11). The boy's hairstyle is typical of the puer delicatus, a servant-boy or cup or armour bearer. Roman same-sex practice differed from that of the Greeks, among whom pederasty was a socially acknowledged relationship between freeborn males of equal social status. Roman men, however, were free to engage in same-sex relations without a perceived loss of masculinity only as long as they took the penetrative role and their partner was a social inferior such as a slave or male prostitute: the paradigm of \"correct\" male sexuality was one of conquest and domination. There are significant differences to pederastic scenes found on classical Greek vases. The sex act is presented in graphic detail, and the \"beardless youth\" appears to encourage the penetration, grasping his lover's arm. In Roman artwork there is an assumption that the penetrated youth is a slave or prostitute and on the Warren Cup, a mutual tenderness is represented.", "Dyfri Williams, previously the Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, dated the cup to AD 5\u201315. Williams identified several factors supporting that dating. The silver alloy being 95% pure is consistent with other known Roman silver vessels, with silver from later periods having a far higher purity. Cracks in the cup retain chemical corrosion products which are symptomatic of age, remaining despite being cleaned twice during the 20th century. An EDX analysis showed that the corrosion was silver chloride. Subsequent testing in 2015 of the inside repouss\u00e9 shelf and the reverse of the liner, neither of which had been cleaned, found substantial silver chloride corrosion.. The decorative style and shape have a close parallel with many other vessels of the period, such as the Chryses kantharosBritish museum,  and the closely matching figures of nude men on the Hoby skyphoi, discovered a decade after the Warren cup was first recorded."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Williams", "response": ["*Dyfri Williams (born 1952), British classical archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Satala Aphrodite", "response": ["The British Museum's website describes the work as a \"bronze head from a cult statue of Anahita in the guise of Aphrodite or Artemis.\" The Armenian scholar Mardiros Ananikian wrote in The Mythology of All Races (1925) that it is a \"Greek work (probably Aphrodite), found at Satala, worshiped by the Armenians.\" James R. Russell described it as \"of the Greek Aphrodite type [...] believed to be from a statue of Anahit but more probably from a Roman temple\". Zhores Khachatryan, a leading Armenian archaeologist of the Hellenistic period, stated that \"the Armenian origin of the statue still has to be proven\". He believes that \"it is more possible that it may be the statue of a Roman pagan goddess\" as it was found near the site of a Roman camp inhabited during the time period of its assumed creation. Khachatryan had no doubt that it is a replica of Aphrodite of Knidos. Dyfri Williams wrote that it comes from a Greek cult statue, \"probably made in a Greek city in Turkey\" and found at Satala (in Armenia Minor). Terence Mitford suggests that it is \"normally assigned to Aphrodite\" and an identification as Anaitis (Anahita) is \"wholly implausible\". Babken Arakelyan found Artemis to be a more probable subject of the statue than Aphrodite."]}, {"page": "Ann Wheeler Harnwell Ashmead", "response": ["Other colleagues and circle of archaeologists and classicists include Richmond Lattimore, Richard Green, Phyllis Pray Bober, Ingrid Edlund Berry, Theresa Howard Carter, Jess Jeanny Canby, Crawford Hallock Greenewalt, Jr., Adrienne Mayor, Jocelyn Penny Small and Dyfri Williams."]}, {"page": "List of keepers of the British Museum", "response": ["* 1993\u20132007: Dyfri Williams"]}]}}
