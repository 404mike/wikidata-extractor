There are also a large number of extant anonymous songs from the period. Perhaps the greatest of all the songwriters was Thomas Campion. Campion is also notable because of his experiments with metres based on counting syllables rather than stresses. These quantitative metres were based on classical models and should be viewed as part of the wider Renaissance revival of Greek and Roman artistic methods."]}, {"page": "1519 in literature", "response": ["*1519 or 1520 \u2013 Nicholas Grimald, English poet and translator (died 1562)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Churchyard", "response": ["Thomas Churchyard was born at Shrewsbury in c. 1529, the son of a farmer.Matthew Woodcock, Thomas Churchyard: Pen, Sword, and Ego (Oxford, 2016), p. 2.
