Barnes's leg break spun very little, but he had a topspinner which hurried onto the batsman and yielded him many wickets. Barnes was also a substitute wicket-keeper and a versatile fieldsman. During his career, he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires. On the 1948 tour of England, after an Australian appeal was turned down by umpire Alec Skelding, he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to Skelding, stating: \"Now all you want is a white stick\". A complex character, Barnes, \"rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn. Stocky, with blue eyes and powerful wrists, he had a passion for physical fitness, and was an enthusiastic big-game fisherman and golfer\"."]}, {"page": "Alex Skelding", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alec Skelding"]}, {"page": "Leslie Wright (cricketer)", "response": ["He also picked up the first of his 76 wickets when he removed Leicestershire's Les Berry and Alec Skelding in early June."]}, {"page": "Sid Barnes with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["Barnes returned for the subsequent fixture against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately,Fingleton, p. 59. and put on an opening partnership of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued to build on the foundation laid by the top order and were eventually bowled out for 632. Bradman's bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian appeals had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by umpire Alec Skelding, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball \"wouldn't have hit another set of stumps\" and telling the umpire to get a guide dog.Perry (2008), p. 39. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then  presented to Skelding stating: \"You must need a dog. You're blind when you give those decisions [against Leicestershire] not out\" and \"Now all you want is a white stick\".Fingleton, p. 61. Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena. Barnes later wrote \"Strange how I suggested he find himself a canine companion at Leicester\u00a0... and then one turned up\u00a0... Cricket's a funny game.\"Perry (2008), p. 52."]}, {"page": "John Tew", "response": ["The son of E. W. Tew and his wife,  Catherine Isabel Hawke (sister of Lord Hawke),Nephew of Lord Hawke Married.

Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed in the Oxford first-innings for 4 runs by Alan Shipman, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by Alec Skelding for 9 runs."]}]}}
