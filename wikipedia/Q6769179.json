This is also the case in Brittany, where animal bones can be found, and not human bones, suggesting that these \"passage graves\" were never intended for burials, and certainly not for burials of chieftains. On the most prominent Jersey site,  he comments: \u201cthe bones are scattered in the passage and chamber with no apparent organisation, as at La Hougue Bie, Jersey\u201d..", "So if these sites were not tombs, what were they for? Mark Patton suggest that a useful analogy is that of churches and cathedrals. He argues: \"If one were to excavate Westminster Abbey, one would find human bones, as in most cathedrals and churches, yet Westminster Abbey, although it contains burials, would not in itself be described as a tomb or mausoleum\", and suggests that we look at the dolmens in this light. The historian Ronald Hutton comes to much the same conclusion, that these sites were mainly used as religious centres, and each would have been a \"focus for a group of scattered farms or a settlement, bonded as a clan or family\" - very much a precursor to the idea of a \"parish\".", "So how are to understand the dolmens. Mark Patton suggests that we can imagine the tribes coming together, for various significant times of the year, to celebrate in ritual the passage of the seasons.", "Mark Patton (1987) noted that there was a considerable degree of variation in terms of funerary practices and how the dead were treated. In  Mont Grantez,(Nicolle et al. 1913) \"seven articulated skeletons were found (six were in flexed positions in the chamber, the seventh was apparently placed in a seated position in the chamber). Disarticulated remains, however, are more usual, suggesting prior exposure or burial of the corpse.\"", "Mark Patton noted that the corbelled vault required a rock such as schist, which fractures to give long, flat slabs, and in Jersey, the available rock was not suitable. Consequently, while La Sergent\u00e9 is the earliest passage grave in Jersey, it collapsed soon after its construction, because of the unsuitable building materials available, and was not repeated elsewhere in the Islands.(Patton 1987a).", "Mark Patton comments: \u201cThere are three passage graves in Jersey (Le Mont de la Ville, Faldouet and La Hougue des G\u00e9onnais) which have large, open chambers. The chambers of these monuments cannot have been roofed with capstones (the uprights are too small to have supported capstones large enough to span the chambers), and corbelled vaulting would be impractical given the character of the available stone. It is conceivable that these chambers had wooden roofs, but recent excavations at La Hougue des G\u00e9onnais (Forrest and Rault forthcoming) provided no evidence for this. Assuming that the chambers were open, the cairns of these monuments cannot have covered the chambers whilst they were in use, and must rather have formed a sort of platform around an open \u2018arena\u2019.\u201d", "Mark Patton comments: \u201cRecent researchRenouf and Urry 1986, Patton 1987a and in press has demonstrated the existence of an axe production centre at Le Pinacle, Jersey, and \u2018Type P\u2019 dolerite axes produced at Le Pinacle have been identified in assemblages from Guernsey, Sark and Alderney as well as Jersey. Axes of Type P dolerite, however, seem not to be found on the Armorican mainland. \u201c", "But many historians and archaeologists now believe that the Beaker people did not exist as a group; as Mark Patton explains, the beakers and related artefacts that are attributed to the Beaker people may well indicate the migration of a \"beaker culture\" rather than a \"beaker people\".
