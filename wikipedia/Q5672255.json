Yet his ability was widely recognised, and he fought around the world, facing four past or future world champions, including Emile Griffith and Alan Minter.\nBut he is best known for his two contests in 1965 at the Royal Albert Hall against Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, who had fought for the world title the previous December. In their first meeting in March, Carter was awarded the victory on cuts in the ninth round despite trailing on points, only to be outpointed six weeks later, in what Boxing News declared to be one of the finest victories by a British boxer in the previous 20 years.\nITV made a documentary about Scott called \"Come Out Fighting\" in 1967. It included segments of Scott's family life and his boxing career.\nScott retired in 1973.\nFollowing Scott's retirement he went on to be a Green Grocer.
