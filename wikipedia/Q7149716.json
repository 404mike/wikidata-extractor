Carbutt turned professional for a successful career which included the Land's End to John o' Groats record in 1d 23h 23m 1s, breaking Dick Poole's 14-year-old record by 23m 34s.  In the process, Carbutt lost five minutes in Cornwall when police accused him of speeding. .", ":Paul Carbutt broke Poole's record in 1980. There is one difference in their routes through Scotland: the Forth Road Bridge was built between the two attempts, meaning that Carbutt rode 13 fewer miles. On the other hand he was entangled with traffic on the way to the bridge and might have lost half an hour among the trucks and cars. Poole's time had not been much slower. In 1965 he had arrived at the John o' Groats Hotel at 9.46\u00a0am. Surely this proves that Poole's ride, all of 15 years before, had set a magnificent record."]}, {"page": "Carbutt", "response": ["*Paul Carbutt (1950\u20132004), English cyclist"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team time trial", "response": ["| 6 ||align=left| Paul Carbutt Philip Griffiths Dudley Hayton  William Nickson|| || 2:13:10"]}, {"page": "Carbutt, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Carbutt"]}]}}
