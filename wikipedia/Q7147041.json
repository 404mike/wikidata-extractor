He was also a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1934 to 1936.A member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he took the Parnellite side when that party split.\nHe was an unsuccessful Irish Parliamentary Party candidate in the East Clare by-election in 1917, losing to \u00c9amon de Valera. He joined Sinn F\u00e9in within a year. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922.\nHe became a King's Inns bencher in 1925. In a Seanad \u00c9ireann by-election held on 28 September 1934, he was elected as a Fianna F\u00e1il Senator, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Arthur Vincent, serving until the body's abolition in 1936.\nHe was Attorney General of Ireland from 1936 to 1937 and reappointed under the new Constitution, serving from 1937 to 1940. Maurice Healy in his memoir \"The Old Munster Circuit\" praised Lynch's outstanding integrity and strength of character and, while he was  not normally an admirer of \u00c9amon de Valera, praised him for an inspired choice of  Lynch as Attorney General.\nHis youngest brother, James, on the other hand, was state solicitor for Clare under the Cumann na nGaedheal government.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936", "response": ["Unfortunately the speed with which the 1936 Act was passed also meant that some serious legal matters had been overlooked by the draughtsmen, touching on the top of the Irish legal hierarchy.

As the Governor-Generalship had not been actually abolished by the 1936 Act, this Act was required to validate the otherwise-unlawful appointment of the Chief Justice of Ireland Timothy Sullivan.
