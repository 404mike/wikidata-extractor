Initially they carried out their work without any financial support. While they received advice and moral support from Hugo Obermaier, who at the time was living in Madrid, and from Gero von Merhart at the University of Marburg, only the second and third journeys to Spain were funded by the forerunner of the German Research Foundation (DFG). Initially working in southern Spain, they began systematic mapping of the megalithic tombs of Andalusia. In the process they also met the most important contemporary specialists on the Neolithic of the Iberian Peninsula. They made contact with the Belgian-Spanish archaeologist  Luis Siret y Cels and with the ailing British archaeologist George Edward Bonsor Saint Martin whose widow subsequently gave them access to his records.  While working in Portugal they met with the Portuguese archaeologist Jos\u00e9 Leite de Vasconcelos, who had also been working in Galicia."]}, {"page": "George Bonsor", "response": ["#REDIRECTGeorge Edward Bonsor Saint Martin"]}]}}
