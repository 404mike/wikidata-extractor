E. Foster scoring 6 (One source gives 7). The next match was away against France on 1 November 1906 and resulted in a 15\u20130 win for England, with Stanley Harris netting seven goals and Vivian Woodward four. The team played many internationals against the full representative sides of Europe, which were usually a mixture of amateur and professional players. The strength of the English amateur team meant they were still able to beat many of these sides and in fact they were unbeaten in 20 matches from 1906 to 1910. Whilst these England amateur matches are not considered full senior internationals by The Football Association, they are deemed to be by their opponents. As such, the England amateur side delivered the biggest defeats on several European nations; the Netherlands in 1907, Germany & Belgium in 1909, and Sweden & Hungary in 1912 (as Great Britain), beating them 12-2, 9\u20130, 11\u20132, 12-2 and 7-0 respectively."]}]}}
