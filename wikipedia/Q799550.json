Dresser was a member of the British Ornithologists' Union and the Zoological Society of London. His collection includes specimens from Nikolai Prjevalsky, Robert Swinhoe, Henry Tristram, Alfred Wallace and Henry Seebohm. A collection of birds from the Hawaiian Islands was received from the Royal Society in the 1890s including species that are now extinct. The museum holds the collections of Thomas Coward, Richard Spiers Standen and Robert Coombes who specialised in Eurasian goose species; this collection was acquired in the 1990s.

William Edwin Brooks went to India in 1856 as a civil engineer with the railways and stayed on until 1881. His wife Mary Jane Renwick from Newcastle-upon-Tyne was frail and suffered from poor health in India. It was hoped that she would recover her health with a move to Canada but she died shortly after the family (including three sons and two daughters) reached Quebec. The family initially settled in Ontario, Canada. Brooks was an honorary member of the British Ornithological Union. He corresponded with Alfred Russel Wallace, Thomas C. Jerdon and Robert Christopher Tytler. His vast collection of bird specimens is at the British Museum and during his career in India, he corresponded actively with other ornithologists in the region, notably Allan Octavian Hume. He also corresponded with ornithologists in Britain, including Henry Eeles Dresser, and sent many specimens to Dresser to distribute and trade with other ornithologists on his behalf. Brooks had always hoped that one of his children would take to natural history. His third son Allan Brooks, named after Hume, and sent to study in England and during his study in Northumberland, also trained under John Hancock, the taxidermist who was a friend of William. Allan became an ornithologist and artist of repute in Canada. In 1887, Brooks moved his family from Milton, Ontario, to a new farm at Chilliwack, British Columbia. In 1891, he sold the Chilliwack property to return to Ontario where he bought a farm in Mount Forest."]}, {"page": "Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869", "response": ["In 1868, Professor Alfred Newton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science on the \"On the Zoological Aspect of the Game Laws\".Barclay-Smith (1959) In particular, he urged for protection of birds of prey and seabirds during the breeding season.

He began his ornithological research in the 1890s, making observations near his home in the vicinity of Valmiera and C\u0113sis in present-day Latvia. At this time he started his personal collection of bird eggs. At least from 1894, this collection grew in both size and scope, encompassing not only eggs but also whole birds, skeletons and skulls. His first publication appeared in 1895 in the journal of the Riga Association of Natural Scientists (Der Naturforscherverein zu Riga), predecessor of the Natural History Museum of Latvia. He kept making systematic research of the bird-life of Latvia until at least 1917. In the spring of 1896, he went on a scientific journey to the southern part of the Russian Empire, during which he made the acquaintance of Gustav Radde and Nikolai Zarudny. The latter became a friend of von Loudon and they kept regular contact. von Loudon came to make an additional five such ornithological expeditions, to the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea, Crimea and Central Asia. In 1904, he hosted Henry Eeles Dresser at his estate in Latvia, and one year later he himself travelled to London to participate in an international conference on ornithology,; he was one of only five Russian citizens to participate."]}, {"page": "A History of the Birds of Europe", "response": ["A History of the Birds of Europe, Including all the Species Inhabiting the Western Palearctic Region is a nine-volume ornithological book published in parts between 1871 and 1896.

It describes all the bird species reliably recorded in the wild in Europe and adjacent geographical areas with similar fauna, giving their worldwide distribution, variations in appearance and migratory movements.", "During the early nineteenth century, a number of ornithologies were written in English, including John Gould's five-volume Birds of Europe, which was published between 1832 and 1837.McGhie (2017) pp. 97\u2013100. Richard Bowdler Sharpe, then librarian of the Zoological Society of London, had worked closely with Gould and completed some of his books that were still unfinished when he died. He wished to build on Gould's work to include all species reliably recorded in the wild in Europe, expand the geographical range to include North Africa, parts of the Middle East and the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Azores (this extended area constitutes the Western Palaearctic realm) and to describe the worldwide distribution, variation and movements of each of the species. He lacked the resources to undertake this task on his own, so he proposed to businessman and amateur ornithologist Henry Eeles Dresser that they work together on this great encyclopaedia. Dresser had an extensive collection of European birds and their eggs, and a network of contacts who would allow him to acquire or borrow new specimens. He also had the linguistic skills to translate texts from several European languages."]}, {"page": "Colin Alexander McVean", "response": ["(2) Sending Bird Skins to Henry Eeles Dresser: Dresser got interested in McVean's research on \"On the Ornithology of Yedo (Tokyo)\", asked McVean to send bird skins to London.McVean Diary, March 25, 1875Henry A.
