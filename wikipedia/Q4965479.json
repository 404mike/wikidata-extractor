He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He was a member of the faculty of the Catholic University of America for eight years until becoming professor of medieval history at Cornell University in 1959, becoming the Goldwin Smith Professor of Medieval History in 1969 and the first Bowmar Professor of Humanistic Studies in 1977.His speciality was medieval church history, focusing on the structure of the medieval church and the medieval state, and the influences of the interaction between these on the development of Western institutions. He was widely recognized as a leading authority on medieval church law and political thought. His work in these fields also proved relevant to some of the modern debates about Roman Catholic ecclesiology. Tierney's most recent book was Liberty and Law: The Idea of Permissive Natural Law, 1100-1800. (Catholic University Press, 2014). He continued to work on medieval history until the time of his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Brian Tierney (1922\u20132019), historian"]}, {"page": "Scunthorpe", "response": ["*Brian Tierney, published historian and medievalist"]}, {"page": "Unam sanctam", "response": [" is a papal bull that was issued by Pope Boniface VIII on 18 November 1302. It laid down dogmatic propositions on the unity of the Catholic Church, the necessity of belonging to it for eternal salvation, the position of the Pope as supreme head of the Church and the duty thence arising of submission to the Pope to belong to the Church and thus to attain salvation. The Pope further emphasized the higher position of the spiritual in comparison with the secular order. The historian Brian Tierney calls it \"probably the most famous of all the documents on church and state that has [come] down to us from the Middle Ages\". The original document is lost, but a version of the text can be found in the registers of Boniface VIII in the Vatican Archives. The bull was the definitive statement of the late medieval theory of hierocracy, which argued for the temporal as well as spiritual supremacy of the pope."]}, {"page": "Tierney", "response": ["*Brian Tierney (1922\u20132019), historian and medievalist", "* Brian Tierney  (born 1957), American businessman and newspaper publisher"]}, {"page": "Sidney Painter", "response": ["*A History of the Middle Ages, 284\u20131500 (1953), re-published as Western Europe in the Middle Ages, 300\u20131475, co-authored by Brian Tierney (1983)"]}, {"page": "Brian Tierney", "response": ["Brian Tierney is the fourth of five sons of James and Claire Tierney.

The first period is the encounter of Christian faith with the philosophical tradition of pagan Greece and Rome. Fortin was an accomplished patristics scholar, who wrote extensively on St. Augustine. The second period is the medieval period. Fortin made particular contributions with his study of Dante. He also held the Straussian position that the doctrine of natural human rights was a distinctively modern idea, and did not have backing in classical or medieval thought. This set him against the camp that taught that the idea of natural human rights had medieval roots, most associated with the Cornell medievalist Brian Tierney and his students. Finally, the third period in which he made significant contribution was his perceptive reading, commentary and more-or-less blunt criticism of the 20th century social teaching of the Catholic Church. Here, particularly with respect to the statements of American Catholic bishops, he questioned the degree to which their statements were in conformity with the classical Christian heritage."]}, {"page": "L.
