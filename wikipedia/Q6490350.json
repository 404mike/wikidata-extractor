A goalkeeper, he played for Chester and Millwall before the Second World War, making over 100 appearances in the Football League. He also appeared as a guest player for West Ham United during the Second World War.  In 1947 he joined Gillingham, at the time playing in the Southern League, and helped the club win the championship in 1948. In 1950 the club gained election to the Football League and signed new goalkeeper Larry Gage, but kept Burke on the books. Despite being nearly 40 years old he played five times in the 1950\u201351 season before retiring."]}, {"page": "Jack Day", "response": ["Born in Northfleet, Day played for the local youth club before joining amateur club Erith & Belvedere in 1941. After the Second World War he joined Gillingham of the Kent League, but made only two first team appearances, the second against his hometown club Gravesend & Northfleet in December 1947, after the club had moved up to the Southern League.  He had a short spell with Walthamstow Avenue of the Isthmian League before joining Shrewsbury Town of the Midland League.  He later had short spells with Football League clubs Fulham and Brighton & Hove Albion but failed to make it out of the reserve team.  In July 1949 he rejoined Gillingham and made 16 Southern League appearances deputising for regular goalkeeper Johnny Burke in the 1949\u201350 season, at the end of which the Gills were elected into The Football League. Day, however, broke his arm in a reserve team match at the end of the season and this, combined with the signing of new goalkeeper Larry Gage, limited his first team chances during the 1950\u201351 season.  He made his Football League debut against Aldershot in April 1951, but it was to be his only league appearance."]}]}}
