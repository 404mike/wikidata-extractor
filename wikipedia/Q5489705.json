Abdul Ali solved his first case of a swindler named Karsandas Purushotamdas Bhansali in 1866 and in the same year also solved a case of currency forging. Another prominent case was the intentional burning of a ship, the S.S. Aurora, by its captain. He also helped locate Moulvi Liaqat Ali, an associate of Nana Saheb who was involved in murdering Europeans during 1857. Khan was hailed as an Indian \"Sherlock Holmes\". At Sir Frank Souter's recommendation, he too was conferred the title of Khan Bahadur in 1873. In the same year he helped uncover a murder plotted by a Bombay High Court solicitor and his clerk. Yet another investigation led to the charging of the Malharrao Gaekwar of Baroda of attempting to poison Colonel Phayre, the British Resident. In 1876 he uncovered a fraud involving contractors and forest department officers to illegally cut and trade in timber using false records. Sir Frank Souter noted in 1881 that on account of his being a native he was debarred from being a Superintendent. He was made a Justice of the Peace for the City of Bombay. Souter sought, on behalf of Ali, from the Government a suitable salary comparable to a 1st Class Police Inspector (ie Rs 250 with Rs 25 travelling allowance and additional cover for cost of living in Bombay). In 1881 Sir Frank Souter, Police Commissioner, recommended Ali to the title of First Class Sardar of the Deccan. This was seconded by Colonel Wilson and he received the title on 30th May 1891, signed by Viceroy Lansdowne. He received a Kaiser-i-Hind Gold medal in 1901. He retired in 1903."]}]}}
