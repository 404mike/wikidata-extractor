Being an ecclesiastical reform movement within the Anglican Church, the Oxford Movement wanted to recover the lost treasures of breviaries and service books of the ancient Greek and Latin churches. As a result Greek, Latin and even German hymns in translation entered the mainstream of English hymnody. These translations were composed by people like John Chandler, John Mason Neale, Thomas Helmore, Edward Caswall, Jane Laurie Borthwick and Catherine Winkworth. Besides stimulating the translation of medieval hymns, and use of plainsong melodies, the Oxford Reformers, inspired by Reginald Heber's work, also began to write original hymns. Among these hymnwriters were clergy like Henry Alford, Henry Williams Baker, Sabine Baring-Gould, John Keble and Christopher Wordsworth and laymen like Matthew Bridges, William Chatterton Dix and Folliott Sandford Pierpoint."]}, {"page": "Thanksgiving (United States)", "response": ["* \"For the Beauty of the Earth\" (1864), an English hymn written by Folliott Sandford Pierpoint."]}, {"page": "Folliott S.

Pierpoint had written eight stanzas as a hymn for the Eucharist with a refrain addressing \"Christ, our God\". It appeared in his hymnal Lyrica Eucharistica, The Hymnal Noted, entitled \"The Sacrifice of Praise\". The poet wrote about his experience of feeling blessed some day when he looked at the countryside near Bath, England, reflecting the beauty of the earth, of \"each hour of the day and of the night\", and of \"the joy of human love\". The hymn was combined in hymnals with the hymn tune \"Dix\". It was first used as a communion hymn, but soon became a favorite for the Thanksgiving season. Rutter, as others before him, changed the refrain to addressing \"God of all\", giving it a more general meaning of thanks and praise for the Creation."]}]}}
