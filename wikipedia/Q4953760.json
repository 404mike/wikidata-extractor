He then studied at the University of Edinburgh, where the lecturers who impressed him included Andrew Duncan, the younger, and Robert Jameson in natural history. His first published paper, on the spleen, came from Duncan's course, and drew on the veterinary writings of his friend Bracy Clark.Kass & Kass, pp. 70\u20132.

The first students, just four of them, began their studies in 1792, and the first horse was admitted for treatment in 1793. St Bel died later that year and was succeeded by Edward Coleman, who managed the college for nearly forty six years and established its reputation. Among the first students were Delabere Pritchett Blaine and Bracy Clark. In its early years it was mainly concerned with horses, but the range of animals covered gradually increased. The original building was a quadrangle in a neoclassical style, and there was a paddock on the opposite side of Royal College Street, but this was later sold for housing development."]}, {"page": "Bracy Clarke", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bracy Clark"]}, {"page": "List of contributors to Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia", "response": ["|Bracy Clark (1771\u20131860)  ||\t\tComparative Anatomy (Not listed in Phil.
