Many of the fortifications were attacked and crumbled to heaps of rubble; only the fortifications built in 1753 have survived in good condition, as Admiral Vernon bypassed Portobello during the last battle. Earlier, Sir Francis Drake was unsuccessful in attacking the fort as he succumbed to fever and was buried in the bay. But he had burned Nombre De Dios in 1596. His lead casket buried in the sea bears his name. In 1597, after Drake\u2019s episode, the Spanish Empire decided to fortify the port as the treasury was moved to Portobelo. Fort San Felipe was built first at the entrance to the harbour and was fortified with 35 canons. Fort San Jeronimo was built on the eastern part, and Fort Santiago de la Gloria, on the western part of the bay. These forts were built with coral stones walls, which are as strong as granite.  In 1668, the Welsh Buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan attacked Portobelo, using ladders wide enough to carry 3 men abreast to scale the walls of the fortifications. For a month the pirates occupied the city, but no substantial damage to the defensive structures was reported. In 1688 English Pirate Bartholomew Sharp and French buccaneer La Sound attacked the fortifications and caused different degrees of damage.
