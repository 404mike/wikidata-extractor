By then, he believed Nigeria needed economic re-structuring. In 1985, prior to his appointment, the military sought the public opinion of an IMF economic structuring proposal as a condition for external credit from the fund. The popular opinion was to reject the proposal. The administration then came up with Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). SAP was a proposal to diversify export from a crude oil dependent regime, ensure fiscal and balance of payments equilibrium and non-inflationary growth.Transition without end : Nigerian politics and civil society under Babangida / edited by Larry Diamond, Anthony Kirk-Greene, Oyeleye Oyediran. Boulder, Colo. : Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1997. p 308 The mechanisms to be implemented in order to achieve these objectives were the devaluation of the naira, reduction of petroleum products subsidies and trade liberalization. During his time in office, Falae became a vocal defender of SAP even when it was becoming unpopular with the masses, earning him the moniker \"Mr. SAP\" amongst ordinary Nigerians.Adebanwi, Wale.
