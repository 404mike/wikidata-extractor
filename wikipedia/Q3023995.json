He became the story editor on Doctor Who and, as the producer of the series in 1969, he oversaw the transition from black-and-white to colour by producing Patrick Troughton's final story and Jon Pertwee's first.

In The War Games (1969), the Second Doctor says the Time Lords are \"an immensely civilised race\". Writer Malcolm Hulke and writer and script editor Terrance Dicks repeat this description in their 1972 book The Making of Doctor Who. In The Time Warrior (1973\u201374), Commander Linx quotes Sontaran military intelligence as describing the Time Lords as \"A race of great technical achievement, but lacking the morale to withstand a determined assault.\" In Pyramids of Mars (1975), Sutekh calls the Time Lords \"a perfidious species\". In \"School Reunion\" (2006), the alien Krillitane Mr Finch calls the Time Lords \"such a pompous race\". In \"Smith and Jones\" (2007), the Tenth Doctor answers \"what sort of species [he is]\" with \"I'm a Time Lord.\" In \"Human Nature\" (2007), Tim Latimer hears a voice saying, \"Last of the Time Lords, the last of that wise and ancient race.\" In \"Utopia\" (2007), the Tenth Doctor answers \"what species are you\" with \"Time Lord, last of.\" In \"The Sound of Drums\" (2007), the Tenth Doctor calls the Time Lords \"the oldest and most mighty race in the universe\". In \"Planet of the Dead\" (2009), the Tenth Doctor says, \"I come from a race of people called Time Lords.\" About sixteen minutes into \"Let's Kill Hitler\" (2011), a computer readout describes the \"Pilot Species\" of the Doctor's ship the TARDIS as \"Time Lord\". In \"The Witch's Familiar\" (2015), Davros describes a prophecy that spoke of a \"hybrid creature [of] two great warrior races forced together to create a warrior greater than either,\" and believes that the creature being referred to was \"half Dalek, half Time Lord.\" In \"Before the Flood\" (2015), the Fisher King describes the Time Lords as \"the most warlike race in the galaxy\". In \"Hell Bent\" (2015), the General describes the Hybrid as being \"crossbred between two warrior races\". He says it is supposed that these races are \"the Daleks and the Time Lords\". In \"Knock Knock\" (2017), the Twelfth Doctor tells Bill Potts the Time Lords are \"my species\". Writing in issue No. 356 of Doctor Who Magazine, head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies describes the Time Lords as \"the Doctor's race\". In a special feature on the DVD set of The Invasion of Time, script editor Anthony Read called the Time Lords \"an interesting species to somebody coming in\". In a special feature on the DVD and Blu-ray set of series 8, actor Peter Capaldi said the Doctor belongs to \"a race called the Time Lords\". Terrance Dicks recalled in a 2016 interview in The Essential Doctor Who magazine that during a discussion of The War Games, producer Derrick Sherwin said the Doctor belongs to \"this mysterious race called Time Lords\". The Time Lords are also referred to as a race by media outlets including the Radio Times and The New York Times, while a correction in a 2014 NPR article claims that \"not all Gallifreyans are Time Lords\". \"The Stolen Tardis\" (1979), a spin-off comic printed in issue No. 9 of Doctor Who Weekly (the original name of Doctor Who Magazine) also claims that \"not everyone on Gallifrey is a Time Lord\", while a feature in issue No. 21 instead states that the Doctor is \"a member of a race called the Time Lords\"."]}, {"page": "Time Lord", "response": ["In an audio commentary recorded for the 2009 DVD release of The War Games (1969), producer Derrick Sherwin mentioned how in a discussion with the serial's co-writer Terrance Dicks the previous day, Dicks was \"absolutely certain\" that Sherwin created the Time Lords for the serial, although Sherwin could not remember himself. Later in the commentary, Dicks recalled Sherwin telling him in the discussions with Dicks and Dicks' fellow co-writer Malcolm Hulke that because the Doctor had always been established as being on the run from his own people, that if he has to appeal to them, the Doctor would be in trouble. In a 2016 interview with The Essential Doctor Who magazine, Dicks mentioned how when Sherwin and he were discussing The War Games one day, Sherwin said, \"He belongs to this mysterious race called the Time Lords, doesn't he?\" with \"everything\" ultimately coming from that discussion.

Producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks, inheriting this new vision for the series, also wanted their stories for the seventh season to have a serious, deeper subtext.

Serials directly influenced include The Web of Fear, The Invasion, Spearhead from Space, The Ambassadors of Death, Inferno, The Daemons, The Seeds of Doom and Image of the Fendahl, as well as the 2007 \"The Lazarus Experiment\", which echoes the first serial's climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral.

In a series of interviews originally recorded for the 2006 DVD of the Doctor Who serial Inferno (1970), actor Nicholas Courtney, who played Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart in The Invasion, similarly described The Invasion as a \"dummy run\" for the idea of the Doctor, the main protagonist of Doctor Who, being exiled to Earth. Dicks also said that the idea of exiling the Doctor was done because making every serial take place on Earth was cheaper to produce than if every serial had to have a new alien planet built, and that UNIT was an idea Sherwin had come up with to answer the question of what to do with the Doctor after he was exiled to Earth. Speaking in an interview on the 2012 DVD of the Doctor Who serial The Krotons (1968\u201369), Sherwin said that he wanted Doctor Who to be \"down on Earth anyway, for credibility\", and described UNIT as \"the ideal vehicle\" for this."]}, {"page": "The War Games", "response": ["Jane Sherwin who played Lady Jennifer Buckingham was producer Derrick Sherwin's wife."]}, {"page": "Quatermass and the Pit", "response": ["In a 2006 Guardian article Mark Gatiss wrote \"What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn't owe Kneale a huge debt?\u00a0...

Derrick Sherwin, the producer of Doctor Who in 1969, acknowledged Quatermass and the Pits influence on the programme's move towards more realism and away from \"wobbly jellies in outer space\". The 1971 and 1977 Doctor Who serials The D\u00e6mons and Image of the Fendahl share many elements with Quatermass and the Pit: the unearthing of an extraterrestrial spaceship, an alien race that has interfered with human evolution and is the basis for legends of devils, demons and witchcraft, and an alien influence over human evolution."]}, {"page": "The Tomb of the Cybermen", "response": ["Peter Bryant, who had previously been assistant to Gerry Davis and been newly promoted to script editor on the preceding story, was allowed to produce this serial in order to prove that he could take over from Innes Lloyd as producer later on in the season.

This was a profoundly significant change: it allowed much more rehearsal time, in a much less frantic atmosphere; it ended a long running dispute with the unions representing the technical crews; it reduced wear-and-tear on the sets (and the budget allocations for repairing the damage); and it meant that, forever after, serials could only be made in multiples of 2 episodes\u2014a primary reason for the 4-episode and 6-episode format dominating the schedules for the following fifteen years.
