He then joined Barnsley in August 1905, via a short spell with Thornhill United. In April 1907, he was sold to Manchester United for a fee of \u00a3200.\nStacey made his Manchester United debut on 12 October 1907, playing at left back in a 6\u20131 away win over Newcastle United. That season, he made 18 league appearances and scored one goal as United won the First Division title by nine points over Aston Villa - the first major trophy in Manchester United's history. The following year, Stacey played more regularly at right back, playing in 38 matches on the way to the 1909 FA Cup title. In 1910\u201311, United won the First Division again, albeit only by one point, with Stacey missing only two matches.\nAs a result of his consistency with Manchester United, Stacey went for a trial with the English national team in 1912. However, he never made an appearance for the team.\nStacey remained with Manchester United until the outbreak of the First World War forced the temporary cancellation of competitive football in England. During the war, Stacey made guest appearances for his hometown club, Rotherham County. He retired from football at the end of the 1918\u201319 War League season in May 1919.\nHe died in 1972 at the age of 91, and by this time he was one of Manchester United's last surviving players from their early successes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stacy", "response": ["* George Stacey (1881\u20131972), English footballer", "* George Stacey (1787\u20131857), Quaker abolitionist"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester United F.C. players", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| George Stacey"]}, {"page": "Rotherham County F.C.", "response": ["* George Stacey"]}, {"page": "1909 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|RB ||2 ||George Stacey"]}, {"page": "1908 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["The first match was played on a very damp pitch in poor weather and ended in a 1\u20131 draw between the two sides, with the QPR goalkeeper Charlie Shaw also saving a penalty struck by George Stacey. Following the match it was thought that the two sides would share the honours, but instead at the suggestion of Arthur Kinnaird, 11th Lord Kinnaird, the match was replayed in late August. It was once again played at Stamford Bridge and the two teams fielded most of the same players with only a few exceptions. On this occasion the weather was far improved and the attendance by spectators was far higher with 50,000 fans attending. Manchester United won the game by four goals, and between the two matches more than \u00a31000 was raised for charity.", "Manchester United were initially surprised by the abilities of the Queens Park Rangers players, in particular the two full backs. They had the majority of the early play and in the eleventh minute Alfred Gittins and P. Skilton took the ball past the United half backs before passing it onto Frank Cannon. He dribbled it towards goal and scored past Moger. After the goal, the United team improved but Skilton nearly scored twice more for Rangers. Just before half time, United had a chance when Billy Meredith played a ball on for Jimmy Turnbull but an injury to a QPR player stopped play. Charlie Roberts took the ball for United immediately afterwards and took it into the area, but was fouled with a penalty awarded. George Stacey stepped up to take the shot, but Charlie Shaw in goal for Rangers got a hand to the ball and saved it.", "|RB ||2 || George Stacey", "|RB ||2 || George Stacey"]}, {"page": "1911 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|LB ||3 || George Stacey"]}, {"page": "1908\u201309 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| George Stacey"]}, {"page": "Thorpe Hesley F.C.", "response": ["* George Stacey"]}, {"page": "Charles Reed (footballer)", "response": ["He played football for Sunderland West End before signing for Barnsley as \"a promising left full-back\" in May 1905.
