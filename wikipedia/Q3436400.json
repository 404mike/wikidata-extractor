He then joined Barnsley in August 1905, via a short spell with Thornhill United. In April 1907, he was sold to Manchester United for a fee of \u00a3200.\nStacey made his Manchester United debut on 12 October 1907, playing at left back in a 6\u20131 away win over Newcastle United. That season, he made 18 league appearances and scored one goal as United won the First Division title by nine points over Aston Villa - the first major trophy in Manchester United's history. The following year, Stacey played more regularly at right back, playing in 38 matches on the way to the 1909 FA Cup title. In 1910\u201311, United won the First Division again, albeit only by one point, with Stacey missing only two matches.\nAs a result of his consistency with Manchester United, Stacey went for a trial with the English national team in 1912. However, he never made an appearance for the team.\nStacey remained with Manchester United until the outbreak of the First World War forced the temporary cancellation of competitive football in England. During the war, Stacey made guest appearances for his hometown club, Rotherham County. He retired from football at the end of the 1918\u201319 War League season in May 1919.\nHe died in 1972 at the age of 91, and by this time he was one of Manchester United's last surviving players from their early successes.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
