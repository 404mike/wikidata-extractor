Although in his first full season he helped the team finish sixth in the League, with low attendances the club had fallen into debt and had to sell many of their best players, with stars such as Tim Coleman, Bert Freeman, Jimmy Sharp, Jimmy Ashcroft and William Garbutt all leaving during 1908. Although Morrell led the club to 6th place in 1908-09, at the time an all-time best, after that the club declined, finishing 18th the next.In 1910 Arsenal were taken over by Sir Henry Norris but despite speculation he would be sacked, Morrell continued in his  post. Arsenal rallied to finish 10th, in mid-table, for both the 1910-11 and 1911-12 seasons. Morrell applied for the job of Leeds City manager in the 1912 close season but dropped out of the running after being dissuaded by the Arsenal board; the job went instead to Herbert Chapman, who would one day manage Arsenal. Unfortunately for Morrell, by staying he oversaw a massive drop of form in 1912-13. Woolwich Arsenal eventually finished bottom of the First Division, giving Morrell the distinction of being the only Arsenal manager to have overseen a relegation.Despite relegation, Arsenal, who had by now moved to the new Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, retained Morrell and under him they came close to automatic promotion, finishing third in the Second Division in 1913-14 (missing out on second on goal average) and then fifth in 1914-15. This placing was high enough to get them eventually elected back into the expanded First Division in 1919, when competitive football resumed after the conclusion of World War I; however, Wolves and Barnsley had finished higher that season and were not granted promotion. Arsenal's return to the First Division appears to have been mainly thanks to political machinations by their chairman, Henry Norris, rather than their performance.By then, Morrell was no longer Arsenal manager; after having been told he was due to be sacked at the end of the 1914-15 season due to the suspension of football due to World War I, he resigned on or around 19 April 1915. He returned to Scotland to manage Third Lanark and his fate after that is unknown.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlie Buchan", "response": ["Buchan first played as an amateur for local club Woolwich Arsenal, joining the club in December 1909.

He then joined Fulham as a scout before in 1914 he joined Arsenal's coaching staff, working under manager George Morrell. After Morrell's resignation in 1915, McEwen took charge of first-team affairs at the club during the remainder of World War I, becoming the de facto caretaker manager of the team, which played in the London Combination. After the war had ended he was replaced by Leslie Knighton for the start of the 1919\u201320 season, but McEwen continued to stay with the club, working as a dressing-room attendant and as a coach under Herbert Chapman."]}, {"page": "List of Arsenal F.C. managers", "response": ["Harry Bradshaw, appointed in the summer of 1899, was faced with several difficulties, not least falling attendances and limited funds to attract the best players. In his five years at Arsenal, he managed to steer the club away from bankruptcy by signing local talent such as Jimmy Ashcroft and Jimmy Jackson, and directed his team's promotion to the First Division in 1903\u201304. Phil Kelso replaced Bradshaw in the close season and succeeded in keeping the club afloat in the top division. He also steered Arsenal to the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in the 1905\u201306 and 1906\u201307 seasons. Kelso departed in February 1908, amid uncertainty over the club's finances, and was replaced by George Morrell, a fellow Scotsman. Morrell's time as manager coincided with Sir Henry Norris' takeover of Arsenal and the club's subsequent relocation to Highbury. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division in 1913, though the move to North London brought about much larger attendances."]}, {"page": "Bert Freeman", "response": ["With Freeman unable to hold a regular place down, new manager George Morrell, in an effort to alleviate the club's debts, allowed him to join Everton in April 1908. In Freeman's biography in Arsenal Who's Who, it is argued that this was \"one of the great transfer blunders of those early years\". In his three seasons at Arsenal, Freeman scored a total of 24 goals in 49 appearances in league and cup matches."]}, {"page": "George Morrell", "response": ["George Morrell may refer to:", "* George Morrell (football manager) (c. 1872\u2013?), Scottish football manager of Arsenal FC", "* George Morrell (racing driver) in 1975 Hardie Ferodo 1000", "* George Morrell (actor) in His Brother's Ghost"]}]}}
