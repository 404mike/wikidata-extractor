Lady Cumming Gordon spread rumours of these allegations and the school was forced to close in November 1810, depriving Woods and Pirie, both in their 20s, of their good names and only means of support.\"I am utterly ignorant of what was laid to my charge and I am not conscious of anything,\" Marianne Woods told one mother.Marianne Woods and Jane Pirie sued Lady Cumming Gordon for libel and the case went to court on 15 March 1811.

A student named Jane Cumming accused her schoolmistresses, Jane Pirie and Marianne Woods, of having an affair in the presence of their pupils.

In 1984 officers seized 26 books from the Lavender Menace shop, and a shipment of books worth \u00a3250 that were destined for an Edinburgh Festival Fringe reading was detained at Prestwick Airport. Further stock from America was impounded at the docks. The shop's founders circumvented this for a time by addressing their deliveries to Miss Marianne Woods and Miss Jane Pirie, two notable lesbians who lived in Edinburgh in the early 19th century, and sending them to private addresses. They were eventually discovered, although Nielsen noted in an interview that \"I was just happy that their names should be remembered \u2013 even by customs men at the docks\".
