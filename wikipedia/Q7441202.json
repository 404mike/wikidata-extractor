Over 100 different charges had been leveled against the Templars, including heresy, homosexual relations, spitting and urinating on the cross, and sodomy. Most of them were dubious, as they were the same charges that were leveled against the Cathars. and many of King Philip's enemies; he had earlier kidnapped Pope Boniface\u00a0VIII and charged him with nearly identical offenses. Yet Malcolm Barber observes that historians \"find it difficult to accept that an affair of such enormity rests upon total fabrication\".. The \"Chinon Parchment suggests that the Templars did indeed spit on the cross\", says Sean Martin, and that these acts were intended to simulate the kind of humiliation and torture that a Crusader might be subjected to if captured by the Saracens, where they were taught how to commit apostasy \"with the mind only and not with the heart\".. Similarly, Michael Haag suggests that the simulated worship of Baphomet did indeed form part of a Templar initiation rite."]}, {"page": "Bill Douglas", "response": ["*Lanterna Magicka: Bill Douglas & the Secret History of Cinema (2009) Documentary on Douglas's fascination with pre-cinema optical devices, and how he integrated them into Comrades.
