He was educated at Eton College and graduated with First Class Honours in Classics from Trinity College, Oxford. A keen classicist all his life, he was on the committee of the Horatian Society, and was elected in 2002 President of the Classical Association of Great Britain. In 2004 he 'scooped' with evident relish the story of the presentation of an Ode in Pindaric Greek commissioned from an Oxford don for the forthcoming Athens Olympics.Between 1956 and 1958, Howard undertook his national service with the Black Watch as a motor transport officer. He then joined the Glasgow Herald as a general reporter in 1959, working in the city until 1964. He married Myrtle Houldsworth from Ayrshire, the daughter of Sir Reginald Houldsworth, also in 1959.Howard joined The Times in 1964, and wrote on many different subjects during his career. In his popular column 'Lost Words' he discussed the meaning of unusual words, and in 'Modern Manners' he offered practical advice on etiquette. He had a highly individual style, and wrote with wit, concision, and allusive humour. He was also the Times' literary editor., and wrote several books including 'The Royal Palaces' (1970), 'London's River' (1975), and 'We Thundered Out: 200 Years of the Times' (1985).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Void", "response": ["A Void plot follows a group of individuals looking for a missing companion, Anton Vowl.

A Void protagonists finally work out which symbol is missing, but find it a hazardous topic to discuss, as any who try to bypass this story's constraint risk dying. Philip Howard, writing a lipogrammatic appraisal of A Void in his column Lost Words, said \"This is a story chock-full of plots and sub-plots, of loops within loops, of trails in pursuit of trails, all of which allow its author an opportunity to display his customary virtuosity as an avant-gardist magician, acrobat and clown.\""]}, {"page": "Philip Howard", "response": ["Philip Howard may refer to:", "*Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel (1557\u20131595), English nobleman and saint", "*Philip Howard (1629\u20131717), English army officer and Member of Parliament", "*Philip Howard (died 1686) (c. 1631\u20131686), English soldier and politician", "*Philip Howard (1669\u20131711), English Member of Parliament for Morpeth and Carlisle", "*Philip Howard (cardinal) (1629\u20131694), English Roman Catholic cardinal", "*Philip Howard (journalist) (1933-2014), British journalist", "*Philip Howard (pianist) (born 1976), British pianist and composer", "*Philip Howard (Whig politician) (1801\u20131883), Member of Parliament for Carlisle "]}, {"page": "Anthony Wagner", "response": ["In 1981 he defended the ceremonial aspects of British political life in an interview with Philip Howard of The Times: \"Ceremonial induces a more reflective mood.

Dahl was influenced by the stories, and returned to many of the themes in his children's books. His mother also nurtured a passion in the young Dahl for reading and literature."]}]}}
