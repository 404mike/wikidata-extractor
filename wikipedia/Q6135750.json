It was held back by difficult transport conditions; the priority of the Leven Railway and its extensions was not to connect with the pits, and the coastwise and export shipping routes were constrained by the limited harbour facilities on the coast. It was not until 1868 that the Leven and East of Fife Railway constructed a branch line to Muiredge, connecting a pit there, and even so there was no railway route to a useful harbour in East Fife, and much of the export traffic went to Burntisland; this was a long and expensive rail transit.
