After retiring in 1956, he became a scout and is credited with spotting the young Mick Channon.His father, also called Bill, was a half back with Middlesbrough and Nelson in the 1920s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alf Ramsey", "response": ["Ramsey made his full league debut on 26 October 1946, in a Second Division match against Plymouth Argyle at the Dell, replacing the injured regular right-back Bill Ellerington. The nervous Ramsey was helped through the match by the calm reassurance and guidance of the experienced Southampton captain Bill Rochford, the team's other full-back. Southampton won 5\u20131, their joint-biggest win of the 1946\u201347 season, but Ramsey found the pace of the regular peacetime Football League a drastic step up. \"Their reactions to moves were so speedy they had completed a pass, for instance, when I was still thinking things over\", he later wrote. After one more game, Ellerington was reinstated and Ramsey went back to the reserves. Ramsey was kept out of the first team until January 1947, when Ellerington was injured again shortly before an away match against Newcastle United. Southampton lost 3\u20131, but Ramsey was generally considered to have acquitted himself well. He kept his place for the rest of the season, gradually growing in confidence. Dodgin praised Ramsey in a February 1947 interview as a \"player who thinks football, talks football and lives football\".", "In a friendly away at Plymouth Argyle a week later, he slipped as he went into a tackle and injured his knee. Dodgin brought Bill Ellerington back into the side to replace Ramsey while he recovered, and Ellerington performed strongly as Southampton won eight and drew two of the next 10 matches. Dodgin told Ramsey that, given Ellerington's good form, Ramsey was \"going to find it very hard\" to regain his place in the team. Ramsey, not yet in his 30s, was infuriated and considered this a direct insult by Dodgin: he subsequently asked Southampton to place him on the transfer list on 7 March 1949. He obsessed about Dodgin's comment. \"The world did indeed appear a dark and unfriendly place\", he later said; \"...\u00a0for one fleeting moment I seriously contemplated quitting football.\"", "Ramsey's first taste of playing as an international had come while he was at Southampton, when he played for England B against Switzerland B in May 1948. He made his full England debut in December that year, in a 6\u20130 win over Switzerland at Highbury. He briefly lost his England place to his Southampton teammate Bill Ellerington, but following strong performances for Tottenham he returned in England's 2\u20130 home win over Italy on 30 November 1949. Ramsey's introduction to the England set-up coincided with the team's first ever World Cup campaign, the British Home Nations having rejoined football's world governing body FIFA in 1946 after two decades' absence, therefore being excluded from the first three World Cup tournaments in the 1930s. The Football Association (FA) in London had moved on little since the modern game's genesis in the late 19th century, yet remained convinced that English football and the England team were the finest in the world\u2014so superior, indeed, that entering the World Cup was hardly necessary. The evidence presented for this was that England had never lost at home to any team from outside the British Isles. The team was picked by a panel of eight FA selectors, with the role of England manager, held by Walter Winterbottom, combined with that of FA director of coaching."]}, {"page": "1923 in association football", "response": ["* June 30 \u2013 Bill Ellerington, English international footballer (died 2015)"]}, {"page": "1923 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Bill Ellerington, footballer (died 2015)"]}, {"page": "Bill Rochford", "response": ["After the cessation of hostilities, he joined Southampton in July 1946 for a fee of \u00a3550 in readiness for the first post-war league season.
