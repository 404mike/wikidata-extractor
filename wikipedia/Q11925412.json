This is present in the nave, the crossing, the first bay of the chancel, the arch to the Lady Chapel and in the remains of the choir chapels.  Richards considers that it is the best masonry of the Norman period in Cheshire.  Inside the church are many early effigies which are all damaged, some dating back as far as the late 13th or early 14th\u00a0century. Monuments to the Warburton family are in the Lady Chapel. In the church are two fonts, one dating from the 15th\u00a0century, the other from the Commonwealth period. Two brass chandeliers are dated 1722. The pulpit is from the 19th\u00a0century. The reredos, dated 1876, is by John Douglas and was made by Morris & Co.; it includes a painting of the Last Supper. The organ had been built as a temporary organ for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838 by William Hill and Company of London. It was then rebuilt for St\u00a0John's, transported to Chester by barge and installed at the west end of the church. It was opened on 28 October 1838 with the opening recital given by Henry Gauntlett as he could actually play the pedals. In the 1859\u201366 restoration it was moved to the south transept and in 1895\u201396 it was moved to the north transept, when the organ was put in its current case. In the 1960s it was converted to electro-pneumatic action by Charles Whiteley and Company. In 2002 it was restored by Rod Billingsley following vandalism. The organ case dated 1895 is by Thomas M.\u00a0Lockwood. A memorial to Lockwood is in the north aisle. The stained glass in the east window dated 1863 was designed by T.\u00a0M.\u00a0Penson and made by Clayton and Bell. The west window was designed by Edward Frampton and is dated 1887\u20131890. In the north aisle is a barely visible wall painting of St\u00a0John the Baptist.  The church contains nine memorial boards by members of the Randle Holme family.  Also inside the church are fragments of late Saxon stone crosses that are thought to have been originally in the churchyard.  The parish registers begin in 1559."]}, {"page": "H.J.

In early life Summers was a chorister in Wells Cathedral. After studying under such eminent musicians as Dr. Henry Gauntlett and Sir William Sterndale Bennett, Summers graduated Mus. Bac. at the University of Oxford in 1863, and after holding the post of organist at Weston-super-Mare and at Notting Hill, London, he emigrated to Melbourne in 1865 and for fourteen years was choirmaster and organist at St. Peter's, Eastern Hill, Melbourne, one of the oldest and leading Anglican churches in Victoria. In 1876 he was appointed Government Inspector of Music for State Schools; acts as Musical Examiner for the Tasmanian Council of Education; also the Education Department of Victoria, and assisted Professor Ives (late of Glasgow) as examiner at the University of Adelaide. In 1890 the degree of Mus.

Jeffrey Richards states that \"William Williams's O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness of 1772 (sung variously to Thomas Clark's Calcutta, by Baptists; to  Henry Gauntlett's Triumph, in The Scottish Hymnal; to Edwin Moss's Ulpha, in the 1982 Presbyterian Church Praise) did not make it into Hymns Ancient and Modern, but it was in Bickersteth's Christian Psalmody in 1833 and was still to be found complete in the 1933 Baptist Hymnal \u2026 This very much set the tone for missionary hymns.\" After being published in 374 hymnals throughout history, in the 1960s the hymn stopped being published in all Christian hymnals. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints retained the hymn in their hymnals from 1927 until dropping it in 1985. This was because its members in modern times felt that the hymn connected Native Americans and black people with barbarians."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Mounsey", "response": ["After the death of the prior organist of St Peter upon Cornhill, William Adams, Mounsey competed for the position at 14 years old. The voting was by the vestry and the parish with Mounsey receiving 36 votes from the vestry and 52 votes from the parish. Prior to the competition, she had nine testimonials, with the oldest one dated 30 May 1834. A performance was later held by Mounsey and organist Henry Gauntlett in 1840. In the autumn of 1840, Gauntlett invited German composer Felix Mendelssohn to St Peter to play the organ, where Mendelssohn played a Johann Sebastian Bach composition and two of his own. During the performance, Mounsey and Gauntlett stood on each side of the organist. When Mendelssohn asked Mounsey to perform for him, she declined and asked for his autograph. Mendelssohn presented Mounsey with the opening bars of Bach's passacaglia which was then preserved in the vestry of the church. She resigned from the position in 1882 from deafness."]}]}}
