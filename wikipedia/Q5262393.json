Opening batsman Geoff Cook was then joined at the crease by Allan Lamb, and the pair fought back, adding 113 runs in 32 overs before Cook was run out by Roebuck. In his history of Somerset cricket, Roebuck describes this run out as vital, though he does not give himself credit, stating that \"Geoff Cook ran himself out\".Roebuck (1991), p. 357. Marks identified the point at which Lamb was stumped by Derek Taylor as the point at which \"victory was almost assured.\" Jim Yardley and George Sharp added 20 and 22 runs respectively, but with their captain, Watts, unable to bat through injury, and Somerset's West Indian fast bowler Garner in good form, Northamptonshire were bowled out for 224. Garner added four more wickets to the two he had taken during his first spell, to finish with career-best figures of six wickets for 29 runs. Garner, Botham and Keith Jennings all bowled very economically, each restricting their opponents to less than 30 runs from their bowling. Somerset won the match by 45 runs, winning the Gillette Cup, the first trophy they had won during their 104-year history.", "| Derek Taylor  || not out || 1 || 1 || 100.00"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1979", "response": ["| Derek Taylor ||  ||  || Right-handed || \u2014 || ||  "]}, {"page": "1978 Gillette Cup Final", "response": ["Sussex began their run-chase well; Barclay and Gehan Mendis scored 93 runs together, surviving a spell of attacking fast bowling from Garner and Dredge early on. Mendis had broken his thumb shortly before the final, and in the third over, it was fractured again, but he continued to bat. When Somerset did make a breakthrough, after 24 overs, they collected four wickets for the addition of seventeen runs. Mendis was the first man out, caught by Marks off the bowling of Graham Burgess, followed by Barclay who was caught hooking a delivery from Botham. Miandad was dismissed without scoring, and shortly thereafter, Imran was caught and bowled by Botham for three. Rose then chose to replace his bowlers, and against the less incisive bowling of Keith Jennings and Burgess, Parker and Paul Phillipson were able to establish a 97-run partnership, which brought Sussex to within five runs of their winning target, before Phillipson was by caught by the wicket-keeper, Derek Taylor off the bowling of Dredge. Woodcock thought that Botham in particular bowled too short against Phillipson, who he suggested would have been susceptible to a yorker. In Wisden, Eric Hill opined that Botham's short-pitched bowling, which was a feature of his play late in the season, was due to him being overused by England and Somerset through the year.Preston 1979, pp. 514\u201315.

He discussed it with his teammates and there was no significant opposition\u2014Derek Taylor, the wicket-keeper, did not like the idea, but was not vociferous in the discussion. Viv Richards, Joel Garner and Ian Botham were all very vocal in their support of the suggestion, the former two suggesting that other captains \"would not hesitate to take advantage of the rules\". Rose sought clarification from Donald Carr, the chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), who administered cricket in England. Carr told Rose that his plan was legal, but against the spirit of the laws, and suggested there would be repercussions if they went ahead. Roy Kerslake, the Somerset chairman, was with the team in Worcester and, though he had reservations, told Rose that he would \"support the team whatever their decision\".", "| colspan=\"3\" | Did not bat: Peter Roebuck, Viv Richards, Ian Botham, Vic Marks, Dennis Breakwell, Derek Taylor , Hallam Moseley, Colin Dredge, Keith Jennings"]}, {"page": "1981 Benson & Hedges Cup Final", "response": ["| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Derek Taylor  b Joel Garner || 92", "| colspan=\"3\" | Did not bat: Nigel Popplewell, Vic Marks, Dennis Breakwell, Joel Garner, Derek Taylor, Colin Dredge"]}, {"page": "1982 Benson & Hedges Cup Final", "response": ["| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Derek Taylor  b Colin Dredge || 26", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Derek Taylor  b Ian Botham || 8", "| colspan=\"3\" | Did not bat: Brian Rose, Ian Botham, Vic Marks, Nigel Popplewell, Derek Taylor, Joel Garner, Colin Dredge, Hallam Moseley"]}]}}
