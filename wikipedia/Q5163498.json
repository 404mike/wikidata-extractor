The RAF also early developed the standard three-phase interpretation procedure: first phase required immediate response (such as advancing columns of armor sighted); second phase required 24- hour handling (such as concentrations of landing craft in ports); and third phase was for long-term analysis (such as industrial targets like coal gasification plants). Also, the distinction between strategic and tactical reconnaissance became clear, and sub-specialties like weather reconnaissance, radar photography, and bomb-damage assessment (BDA) became current. Both sides developed programs of regular weather reconnaissance in the Atlantic. In addition, the technique widely known as \u201cdicing\u201d \u2013 extreme low-altitude photography at high speed \u2013 came to be adopted by the Allies for special work.Hansen, 280\u2013281"]}, {"page": "Aage Thaarup", "response": ["Among those who worked for Thaarup were Constance Babington Smith \u2013 a trained hatmaker although she was more interested in aviation \u2013 and the notable milliner John Boyd, who was Thaarup's apprentice.
