A five-time mayor of the Town of Port Pirie, he was a Labor Party member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1918 to 1936, representing the multi-member seat of Port Pirie.Fitzgerald was born in Wallaroo, and moved to Port Pirie with his family at age ten. His family brought two cows with them, and Fitzgerald became the first milk vendor in Port Pirie. He attended a private school until the Pirie School opened, after which he attended there. After leaving school, he worked on the Port Broughton railway line, carted pipes to the Nelshaby Reservoir and worked in Dunn's mill in Port Pirie.While still in his youth, Fitzgerald went to Broken Hill to prospect, and partnering with Duncan McCulloch, established the Britannia-Scotia mine there. He transported the first load of ore from Broken Hill to Port Pirie, for which they split a cheque for \u00a31,000. He continued to work the mine for a time, but was forced to close due to rising water levels. He bought early shares in BHP with his proceeds, but sold out before the company's boom as his parents needed money. He returned to Port Pirie in 1886, where he married Miss Hannan.Fitzgerald worked in the smelters refinery and as a farmer following his return from Broken Hill. In January 1901, he enlisted in the Boer War, where he served with the Fifth Bushmen's Contingent, being promoted to regimental quartermaster and warrant officer while on active service. Following his return from the war on 26 April 1902, he worked on the wharves at Port Pirie, where he served as president of the Waterside Workers' Federation. He was elected as a Corporate Town of Port Pirie councillor in 1905\u201306, but was forced to resign after a year for health reasons.
