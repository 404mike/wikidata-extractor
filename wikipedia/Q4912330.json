Born in Haydock, Lancashire, he began his career in local football with Ormskirk. He later played for Southport Central before moving into the Football League with Blackburn Rovers in February 1915. However, due to the outbreak of the First World War and the subsequent suspension of competitive football in England, he failed to make an appearance for the club.In 1919, Caulfield returned to Southport (the club had dropped \"Central\" from its name), who by then were playing in the Central League. After one season with Southport, he moved to fellow Central League outfit Crewe Alexandra in the summer of 1920, initially as an amateur player. Crewe were founding members of the Football League Third Division North at the start of the 1921\u201322 campaign, and Caulfield signed a professional contract with the club in the summer of 1921. Over the next two seasons, he went on to make 59 League appearances for Crewe, scoring 23 goals during this time.In July 1923 Caulfield joined Nelson, who had just been promoted to the Football League Second Division for the first time in their history. During pre-season training he suffered a groin injury that forced him to miss the first three months of the campaign. When Caulfield eventually made his debut for Nelson on 3 November 1923, he scored two goals in a 3\u20130 win over Coventry City at Seedhill. During the remainder of the 1923\u201324 season, he played 18 League matches and scored a total of five goals. In September 1924, Caulfield was released by Nelson and returned to Crewe Alexandra. In a solitary season with the side, he made 29 appearances but did not score any goals. In the summer of 1925, Caulfield joined Chester, his final club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Haydock", "response": ["*Billy Caulfield, footballer"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["Nelson entered the FA Cup in the Fifth Qualifying Round, and were knocked out in a replay at that stage by Wigan Borough, having drawn the original tie. A total of 30 players were used by Nelson throughout their 44 first-team matches. The majority of the championship-winning team remained with Nelson. New signings included defender Jack Newnes, who went on to become a Wales international, Billy Caulfield and Eddie Cameron. With 14 goals in 42 appearances, Joe Eddleston was the team's top goalscorer for the third season in succession, and also played the highest number of matches of all the first-team squad. The highest attendance of the season at the club's Seedhill stadium was 12,000 on two occasions, the first of these the opening day game against Clapton Orient on 26 August 1923.
