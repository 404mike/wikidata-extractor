The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and theatrical abuse of the instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes as \"symphonic rock\". To increase the visual interest of his show, Emerson abused his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, hitting it, beating it with a whip, pushing it over, riding it across the stage like a horse, playing with it lying on top of him, and wedging knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, turning it over made it feed back, and the knives held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians."]}, {"page": "The Nice", "response": ["The group was formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P.

Although he did release a number of recordings in his own name, such as Lonely Girl (1974), he is most known for his work on recordings with other blues musicians such  as Johnny Shines, Willie Dixon, Jimmy Reed, J. B. Hutto, Sunnyland Slim, Lacy Gibson, and Little Walter. AllMusic noted that \"the playing style of Jackson is vastly influential\".", "He was born in Gill, Lee County, Arkansas, United States. In his youth, Jackson was influenced by his uncle Alf Bonner and aunt Cora, who led their own jug band.  The couple also ran a roadside cafe situated between Helena, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, which regularly played host to blues musicians from neighbouring States. Jackson joined the Bonner's Jug Band and performed with them for a number of years.  He thereafter branched out on his own as a traveling musician, playing in Memphis, then across Florida, in St. Louis, Missouri, before finally, in around 1950, coming to a halt in Chicago, Illinois. The French music historian, G\u00e9rard Herzhaft, later commented that \"The guitar style of Lee Jackson, sharp, jazzy, with sparse but brilliant and bluesy notes was quite original for the immediate post-war Chicago blues scene, reflecting his years playing with swinging jug bands\".", "In mid-1960, Lee Jackson, Eddie Clearwater, Little Brother Montgomery, Roosevelt Sykes, St. Louis Jimmy Oden, Sunnyland Slim, Tom Archia, Corky Roberts(on), and Shakey Jake Harris were all guests at Armand \"Jump\" Jackson's (no relation) \"Blues Party\", an event organized in \"Jump\" Jackson's garage studio, on 5727 South La Salle Street. In 1961, Lee Jackson had \"Please Baby\" / \"Juanita\" released on Key Hole Records.  His own recordings were not successful and he then used his association with various musicians to begin regular work as a studio session player.  By now an accomplished guitarist, his first major studio assignment in this regard was on Roosevelt Sykes album, Roosevelt Sykes Sings The Blues (1962). The collection was recorded in Chicago, and it featured Sykes accompanied by Lee Jackson on guitar, plus Willie Dixon (bass), Armand \"Jump\" Jackson (drums) and Sax Mallard (tenor saxophone). In addition, the album's opening track, \"Slave For Your Love\", was issued on a single. The following year, Jackson switched to playing the bass guitar on Billy Boy Arnold's, More Blues on the South Side. Jackson supplied bass guitar backing on four albums recorded between 1964 and 1966, by Homesick James, Johnny Shines, J. B. Hutto, and Otis Spann. Although the latter's Otis Spann's Chicago Blues had Jackson playing on just one track, the instrumental \"G.B. Blues\", a bonus track on the later CD reissue. In February 1966, Jackson played guitar backing Little Walter recording \"Back In The Alley\", \"I Feel So Bad\", and \"Chicken Shack\"; tracks that eventually appeared in compilation albums such as Blue Midnight Volume Three 1950-1966. J. B. Hutto's 1968 effort, Hawk Squat, saw Jackson revert to rhythm guitar.", "| 1999 || Smile On My Face \u00a7|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Delmark Records || Sunnyland Slim with Lacy Gibson & Lee Jackson"]}]}}
