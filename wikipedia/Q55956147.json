The band brought Lancaster in because of his pop credentials, his heavy rock background and the ability to merge the two. After every recording session the group had a demo where they would re-record each instrument part-by-part. Lancaster would constantly attempt to get the best take every time, according to Duce: \"He'd be like: 'That was shit. You've got to do it again.' There's no bullshit.\" Previously, the band would worry if they made a mistake, as it would cost a lot to hire the studio and personnel; however, since the band had their own studio, they took it at a leisurely pace.

Jones mentioned that the group originally planned to record a few songs but \"liked the sound so much they decided to do the [drum tracks for] whole album\".
