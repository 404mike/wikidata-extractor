In 1332 the monks of Birkenhead Priory were granted exclusive rights to operate a ferry; following the dissolution of the monasteries these rights passed through a number of operators eventually to the township of Birkenhead. It is recorded that Marc Isambard Brunel suggested a road tunnel when designing the Birkenhead docks and from the 1850s a railway tunnel under the Mersey was proposed several times. The Mersey Pneumatic Railway received Royal Assent for a single line pneumatic railway in 1866 but failed to raise the necessary capital. In 1871 the Mersey Railway was given the necessary permissions for an orthodox two track railway connecting the Birkenhead Railway near their  station through a tunnel under the Mersey to an underground station serving Liverpool. However the company found it difficult to raise the necessary funds until Major Samuel Isaac undertook to build the railway in 1881. He contracted construction to John Waddell, who appointed Charles Douglas Fox and James Brunlees as Engineers."]}, {"page": "Liverpool Overhead Railway Southern Extension Tunnel", "response": ["The tunnel was opened for operations on 31 December 1896.  Per the inscription on the tunnel entrance it was constructed under the chairmanship of William Bower Forwood by the engineer Charles Douglas Fox.

Braddock."]}, {"page": "Wirral line", "response": ["A contract was made with John Dickson to raise the necessary funding and then construct the railway, but he soon became bankrupt. Work on constructing the tunnel did not commence until December 1879 when a preliminary contract was entered with Major Samuel Isaac, a London businessman, to dig a pilot tunnel for determining the nature of the strata beneath the Mersey. Isaac subcontracted the construction work to John Waddell & Sons of Edinburgh who appointed James Brunlees and Charles Douglas Fox, eldest son of Sir Charles Fox, as engineers in chief. Two shafts were dug in the grounds of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board for the pilot tunnel - one in Birkenhead with a diameter of  and the other in Liverpool of diameter . It was determined that there was an almost uninterrupted stratum of red sandstone beneath the river and as a result construction began in August 1881 before the pilot bore had been completed.", "At the start of 1884 construction work was pushed ahead with 1400 men and 177 horses underground. On 17 January of the same year two tunnel headings met  from the Birkenhead shaft. A ceremony marked this occasion with Henry Cecil Raikes PC, Major Isaac, Colonel Beaumont, James Brunlees, Charles Douglas Fox, Robert Paterson (Mayor of Birkenhead) and David Radcliffe (Mayor of Liverpool) present. The tunneling work was complete by the end of 1885 and thousands of members of the public took the opportunity to walk through the gaslit tunnel ahead of its official opening."]}, {"page": "Charles Fox", "response": ["*Charles Douglas Fox (1840\u20131921), British civil engineer"]}, {"page": "Douglas Fox", "response": ["*Charles Douglas Fox, British civil engineer known as (Sir) Douglas Fox"]}, {"page": "Charles Fox (civil and railway engineer)", "response": ["In 1830 Fox married Mary, second daughter of Joseph Brookhouse, by whom he had 3 sons and a daughter \u2013 two of them becoming the engineers Francis Fox and Charles Douglas Fox."]}, {"page": "Shore Road Pumping Station", "response": ["It was designed by engineers James Brunlees and Charles Douglas Fox and built in the 1880s as part of the Mersey Railway.
