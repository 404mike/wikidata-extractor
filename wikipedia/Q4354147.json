He is perhaps best remembered for his work on three BBC Radio series: Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh (1944\u201354), Beyond Our Ken (1958\u201364) and Round the Horne (1965\u201368).\nThe son of a clergyman who was also a politician, Horne had a burgeoning business career with Triplex Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.\nIn 1958 Horne suffered a stroke and gave up his business dealings to focus on his entertainment work. He was the anchor figure in Beyond Our Ken, which also featured Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick, Betty Marsden and Bill Pertwee. When the programme came to an end in 1964, the same cast recorded four series of the comedy Round the Horne.\nBefore the planned fifth series of Round the Horne began recording, Horne died of a heart attack while hosting the annual Guild of Television Producers' and Directors' Awards; Round the Horne could not continue without him and was withdrawn. The series has been regularly re-broadcast since his death. A 2002 BBC radio survey to find listeners' favourite British comedian placed Horne third, behind Tony Hancock and Spike Milligan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Kenneth Horne (1907\u20131969)"]}, {"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["Sellers wrote to the BBC in 1948, and was subsequently auditioned.

Frustrated with the slow pace of his career, Sellers telephoned BBC radio producer Roy Speer, pretending to be Kenneth Horne, star of the radio show Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. Speer called Sellers a \"cheeky young sod\" for his efforts, but gave him an audition. This led to his brief appearance on 1 July 1948 on ShowTime and subsequently to work on Ray's a Laugh with comedian Ted Ray. In October 1948, Sellers was a regular radio performer, appearing in Starlight Hour, The Gang Show, Henry Hall's Guest Night and It's Fine To Be Young."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Williams", "response": ["Kenneth Charles Williams (22 February 1926\u00a0\u2013 15 April 1988) was an English actor.

Tiring of this reduced status, he joined Kenneth Horne in Beyond Our Ken (1958\u201364), and its sequel, Round the Horne (1965\u201368). His roles in Round the Horne included Rambling Syd Rumpo, the eccentric folk singer; Dr Chou En Ginsberg, MA (failed), Oriental criminal mastermind; J.

Their first appearance was in episode four of the first series, and \u2013 although Marty Feldman apparently \"got tired of them\" \u2013 Julian and Sandy proved to be the most successful part of the show, and appeared in every episode thereafter.", "As well as being a successful comedy act, Julian and Sandy were notable for being two stereotypical camp homosexual characters in mainstream entertainment at a time when homosexual acts between men were illegal in the United Kingdom. The writers and cast thought the characters worked very well as they were not simply there to be the target of a joke: in fact most of the sketches revolved around Kenneth Horne's presumed ignorance being the target of their jokes. Paul Baker writes that these sketches, while mocking an oppressed gay identity, present gay people as cheerful, rather than \"indexing unhappy, ashamed identities like those in films such as Victim (1961), A Taste of Honey (1961) and The Boys in the Band (1970), or the openly politicised identity adopted by members of the Gay Liberation Front\".", "On 30 December 1987, a special edition of Wogan called Radio Fun paid tribute to BBC radio comedy.

For this, Rambling Syd was customarily introduced by Kenneth Horne, who would set things up by (for example) inquiring as to the nature and origin of the song. Rambling Syd would (usually) respond with an \"Ello, me dearios\", before launching into the ensuing detailed explanation which left a great deal to the imagination. The songs themselves pushed and extended boundaries of sexual suggestiveness, using nonsense (or little-known) words such as 'moolies' and 'nadgers' in suggestive contexts.'Nadgers' is one of many words with sexual innuendo which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s to evade strict BBC censorship. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly based on 'gonad'. When Rambling Syd Rumpo on Round the Horne asked \"What shall we do with the drunken nurker?\", the answer he gave was \"Hit him in the 'nadgers' with the bosun's plunger...'til his 'bogles' dangle\". Many of the words used by Rambling Syd were invented by the Round the Horne scriptwriters Barry Took and Marty Feldman, who wrote the majority of the songs' lyrics, based upon traditional folk songs. Some were existing words used in a suggestive context, such as 'artefacts' (often used in an archaeological context for things such as grave goods) and 'nadgers', which had already appeared in The Goon Show.", "*Rambling Syd Rumpo: Starring Kenneth Williams & Kenneth Horne: 40 Warbles from \"Round the Horne\"'s Doyen of Folk Singers (CD 1996)"]}, {"page": "List of British comedians", "response": ["*Kenneth Horne (1907\u20131969), Round the Horne, Beyond Our Ken"]}, {"page": "Double entendre", "response": ["In Britain, innuendo humour began to transfer to radio and cinema from the late 1950s on. Particularly significant in this respect were the Carry On series of films and the BBC radio series Round the Horne; although some of Round the Horne appeared to be nonsense language, the protagonists were sometimes having \"rude\" conversations in Polari (gay slang). Round the Horne depended heavily on innuendo and double entendre, the show's name itself being a triple entendre, a play on the name of its central actor Kenneth Horne and those around him, the sailor's expression \"going round the horn\" (i.e. Cape Horn), and the fact that \"horn\" is slang for an erection. Spike Milligan, writer of The Goon Show, remarked that a lot of \"blue\" (i.e. sexual) innuendo came from servicemen's jokes, which most of the cast understood (they all had been soldiers) and many of the audience understood, but which passed over the heads of most of the Senior BBC producers and directors, most of whom were \"Officer class\"."]}, {"page": "Beyond Our Ken", "response": ["Beyond Our Ken (1958\u201364) was a radio comedy programme, the predecessor to Round the Horne (1965\u201368).
