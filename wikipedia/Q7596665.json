At some point during the last century, it was renamed as the Old Manor or Manor House. During the residence of Thomas Hotchkin's great grandson, Stafford Vere Hotchkin (1876\u20131953), who helped to redesign the adjacent world-rated golf course which bears his name, there were major additions to the building. Around 1905 the south-west corner and east wings were built, greatly enlarging the footprint of the property, leaving the front entrance wholly Georgian, whilst, to the left and right are the Edwardian additions. The magnificent sweeping staircase, the beautiful hallway and Queens Room fireplaces, and the mahogany panelled entrance to the library all date from this period of high elegance. In 1965, Thomas Hotchkin\u2019s great great grandson, Neil Stafford Hotchkin (1914\u20132004), sold the property to the National Farmers Union and it was converted into offices as the company\u2019s regional headquarters.  Around twenty five years later, it was sold to a local businessman, who continued to run it as offices for various Lincolnshire companies. In 2013 new owners renamed it Woodhall Spa Manor and it now serves as a wedding and event venue.", "Local landowner Stafford Vere Hotchkin, offered a sandy tract of land off the Horncastle Road to build an 18-hole course. The course was designed by Harry Vardon and was formally opened for play on 24 April 1905. It was remodelled in 1911 by Harry Colt, and again by Hotchkin himself in the 1920s."]}, {"page": "Samuel Pattinson", "response": ["He first contested a Parliamentary seat at the 1918 general election when he stood as Liberal candidate in Horncastle.The Times, 26 November 1918 As a supporter of H H Asquith he was not given the government coupon which was granted to  Coalition Unionist  William Weigall.
