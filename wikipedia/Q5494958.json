He was handed his \"Mariners\" debut by player-manager Brian Laws on 17 August 1996 when he came on as a 78th-minute replacement for Neil Woods in Town's 3\u20131 home defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Grimsby were relegated from the First Division at the end of the 1996\u201397 season with Wrack featuring 11 times, scoring once in a 1\u20131 away draw with Reading. During the same season Wrack also spent a month on loan at Shrewsbury Town, featuring in five games for Fred Davies's \"Shrews\". During the 1997\u201398 season, with the club now under the tenure of Alan Buckley, Wrack failed to make an impact in the first team with the likes of Kevin Donovan, Tommy Widdrington and Paul Groves favoured over Wrack. Wrack would only feature twice for Grimsby under Buckley this season, a Football League Trophy victory over Hull City and a league defeat to Northampton Town. Grimsby earned promotion back to the First Division via the play-offs as well as winning the Football League Trophy in a Wembley double, however Wrack did not feature in either occasion. Speaking in 2006, Wrack stated that he felt he was \"never given the chance to shine\" at Blundell Park."]}, {"page": "Jim Barron", "response": ["Barron began his playing career at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1961.

As an apprentice, he was also employed as the club's ground staff where youth players were required to fulfill various tasks, such as cleaning kit and clearing rubbish from the stands at the ground after matches. With no organised age group league to play in, the youth team competed in local amateur divisions against senior teams. During the 1970\u201371 season, Cardiff's youth team entered the FA Youth Cup and reached the  final of the competition, the furthest the side has ever advanced. Having won five ties, Cardiff faced Arsenal in the final. Cardiff held Arsenal to a goalless draw in the first leg before losing the return fixture 2\u20130 at Ninian Park."]}]}}
