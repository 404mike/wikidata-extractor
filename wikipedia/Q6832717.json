Upon being elected as Member of Parliament, represented Ince from 1964 to 1983, and Makerfield from 1983 until he was deselected by his constituency party in 1987, largely because of his failure to support the miners' strike of 1984 to 1985.\nIn 1954 he married Marie T. Murphy (died 1998), with whom he had three sons and two daughters. He died in Aintree University Hospital in August 2018 at the age of 92.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael McGuire", "response": ["*Michael McGuire (politician) (1926\u20132018), British Labour Party politician", "*Michael McGuire (author), author and newspaper columnist", "*Michael McGuire (actor) (born 1934), American actor"]}, {"page": "Michael McGuire (Member of Parliament)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael McGuire (politician)"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 2010s", "response": ["|Michael McGuire"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2018", "response": ["*Michael McGuire, 92, British politician, MP for Ince (1964\u20131983) and Makerfield (1983\u20131987).St Helens Star: Michael Thomas McGuire death announcement"]}, {"page": "Deselection of Labour MPs", "response": ["|Michael McGuire"]}]}}
