Ben Phillips then made an unbeaten 27 to lift his team to 154 for 8, however, but he couldn't take a wicket while bowling. Despite three run-outs, Somerset made it through on the penultimate ball, as Matthew Wood recorded 58 and Blackwell a 16-ball 31 to lay the foundation before Keith Parsons set the pace late on with an unbeaten 38.", "Defending champions Leicestershire Foxes failed to take care of an excellent position against Somerset Sabres, as the second semi-final became a low-scoring, yet thrilling affair. After Dinesh Mongia had taken three for 30 to set Somerset back to 139 for 7 after Graeme Smith (with 29), Matthew Wood (38) and Marcus Trescothick (25) had lifted them to 89 for 1 at one point during the innings. Carl Gazzard, Somerset's young wicketkeeper, made 26 to lift them to a final total of 157 for 9."]}, {"page": "International 20:20 Club Championship", "response": ["* Matthew Wood"]}, {"page": "NBC Denis Compton Award", "response": ["*Somerset \u2013 Matthew Wood"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Matthew Wood (2001\u20132007) 75 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Exmouth Community College", "response": ["* Matthew Wood, professional cricketer with Nottinghamshire."]}, {"page": "Matthew Wood (Somerset cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Matthew Wood (cricketer, born 1980)"]}, {"page": "Matthew Wood (Nottinghamshire cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Matthew Wood (cricketer, born 1980)"]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Matthew Wood 51"]}, {"page": "Matthew Wood", "response": ["Matthew Wood may refer to:", "*Sir Matthew Wood, 4th Baronet (1857\u20131908), English cricketer", "*Matthew Wood (rugby league) (born 1969), Australian rugby league footballer", "*Matthew Wood (cricketer, born 1977), English cricketer with Glamorgan CCC", "*Matthew Wood (cricketer, born 1980), English cricketer with Nottinghamshire, previously played for Somerset", "*Matthew Wood (cricketer, born 1985), English cricketer", "*Matthew Wood (sound editor) (born 1972), American sound editor and voice actor", "*Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet (1768\u20131843), MP and Lord Mayor of London", "*Wood (musician) (Matthew Wood, born 1979), drummer with British Sea Power", "*Matthew Wood, killed in the January 2013 Vauxhall helicopter crash"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wood", "response": ["* Matthew Wood (disambiguation), several people", ":*Matthew Wood, killed in the January 2013 Vauxhall helicopter crash", ":*Sir Matthew Wood, 4th Baronet (1857\u20131908), English cricketer", ":*Matthew Wood (cricketer, born 1977), English cricketer with Glamorgan CCC", ":*Matthew Wood (cricketer, born 1980), English cricketer with Nottinghamshire, previously played for Somerset", ":*Matthew Wood (cricketer, born 1985), English cricketer", ":*Matthew Wood (rugby league) (born 1969), Australian rugby league footballer", ":*Matthew Wood (sound editor) (born 1972), American sound editor and voice actor", ":*Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet (1768\u20131843), MP and Lord Mayor of London", ":*Wood (musician) (Matthew Wood, born 1979), drummer with British Sea Power"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Matthew Wood"]}, {"page": "2005 Twenty20 Cup Final", "response": ["In their response, Somerset batted sensibly, knowing what they had to chase.

Blackwell was out shortly after, caught by Law off the bowling of Gary Keedy, but at the other end, Smith remained steady. Wood had given the innings a boost by scoring four consecutive boundaries before his dismissal, and that allowed Smith and James Hildreth to bat patiently, although Smith's boundary-scoring drew comparisons to Viv Richards and Ian Botham. Smith and Hildreth built an unbeaten 53-run partnership, and won the match with eleven balls to spare.
