In June 2012, Shenton signed a deal to re-join Castleford for the start of the 2013 season, and it was later announced that he would be club captain.\nHaving played more than 300 games for the Tigers in all competitions, Shenton holds the club record for most Super League appearances after overtaking Danny Orr. In 2017, he became the first Castleford captain to lead the club to a top-flight league title.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Castleford Tigers", "response": ["Under Daryl Powell and Danny Orr, the club has again started to see success on and off the field. The 2014 side were again lauded as Classy Cas for their fast-paced and exciting style, with home grown players such as club captain Michael Shenton, Daryl Clark, Adam Milner, Oliver Holmes, Craig Huby and Andy Lynch, who was returning to the club. The side reached the Challenge Cup final in August 2014, losing to local rivals Leeds 23\u201310, watched by a crowd of 77,914 at Wembley Stadium. The side would eventually finish 4th in Super League and qualify for the play-offs. They were beaten 41 \u2013 0 by St. Helens in their first game and therefore granted a second chance at progressing with a home tie against Warrington. They were beaten 14 \u2013 30 and therefore knocked out of the play-offs. On 29 September 2015, the club announced the death of chairman Jack Fulton. In 2017, the Tigers enjoyed a phenomenal 23 game regular season as they finished 10 points clear at the top of the table prior to the split having won 20 and losing just 3 of their games. They went into the Super 8's having already secured a top four playoff spot by the end of the Super 8's and winning the League Leaders' Shield in the process. In the semifinal against St Helens, Luke Gale\u2014just days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy\u2014kicked a drop-goal in extra time to send Cas to their first Grand Final with a 23\u201322 win. Sadly they didn't carry on the form they had shown all season and were deservedly beaten by Leeds Rhinos 24\u20136 with a late consolation score coming in the last minute to spare Castleford being the first team to fail to score in a Grand Final. Gale was voted Steve Prescott Man of Steel, while Powell picked up the Coach of the Year award for the second time having previously won in 2014.", "| Michael Shenton"]}, {"page": "2009 Rugby League Four Nations", "response": ["| Castleford Tigers || Michael Shenton", "|LC ||4|| Michael Shenton", "|LC ||4|| Michael Shenton", "|LC ||4|| Michael Shenton", "| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Michael Shenton", "After ten minutes of sustained pressure on Australia's defence England were through, Burgess again charging over under the posts from close range. Sinfield's kick added the Extras so once again England had the lead at 16\u201314. A little over three minutes later it was Australia attacking England's line when their fullback Billy Slater dove over from dummy-half, the lead changing again to be back with the Kangaroos. Thurston couldn't get the conversion so Australia's lead stayed at only two points, 18\u201316. In the fifty-eighth minute the Kangaroos were on the attack again when Thurston chipped ahead from twenty metres out for Brett Morris to chase through and score in the corner behind the England defence. The conversion attempt by Thurston was missed so Australia lead 22\u201316 with twenty-one minutes of the match remaining. Shortly after the kick-off following the try England's Michael Shenton suffered a head clash when trying to tackle front-row forward Ben Hannant and the game was halted as he was stretchered unconscious from the field. Moments after the restart of play Hannant himself was concussed when tackled by James Graham but played on. Australia scored a remarkable try after sixty-six minutes when Darren Lockyer chipped over the top into England's in goal and Slater, chasing through leapt over the dead ball line to slap the ball back in with his hand for Cameron Smith to dive on and claim the four points. Thurston's kick from right in front did not miss so Australia lead 28\u201316. As the Kangaroos returned the ball after a short kick-off from England they reached the opposition's end of the field and Slater scored again after backing up a good break from Smith. The conversion from Thurston was an easy one so the score was 34\u201316 in favour of the visitors with under ten minutes of the match remaining. In the seventy-third minute Jarryd Hayne got a try after running through to chase a Lockyer grubber. Thurston added the extras, Australia's lead now 40\u201316 with a little over five minutes left to play. The Australians got one more try though when Kurt Gidley made a break around the halfway line and kicked ahead, Billy Slater winning the race to the ball to claim his hat-trick in the seventy-seventh minute. Man-of-the-match Thurston added the extras so the score was 46-16 when the final hooter sounded. It was England's heaviest loss to Australia on home soil."]}, {"page": "Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook", "response": ["On 3 September 2010, St. Helens confirmed the capture of Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook on a four-year deal starting in 2011, where he'll join up with St. Helens' other new signings Josh Perry and Michael Shenton.
