Norrie joined the Hardy Players when she was 16, and acted in two plays. In 1924, when her older sister, Gertrude Bugler, played the title role in Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles, young Norrie played Tess\u2019s younger sister, Liza-Lu. As she later recounted, Liza-Lu was a non-speaking part, so Hardy wrote a line for her to say in the play.  The Hardy Players disbanded in 1928, shortly after Hardy's death.\nThe Hardy Players reformed in 2005, at Norrie\u2019s request and she returned to the stage at the age of 100.In 2010, it was revealed that a collection of Hardy\u2019s original manuscripts were to be sold at a charity auction. Woodhall and the New Hardy Players, supported by institutions such as the University of Exeter and Dorset County Museum, launched a campaign to raise \u00a358,000 to buy the collection. The campaign was successful and the papers are now in the Dorset County Museum.Woodhall lived to enjoy performances of several of Hardy\u2019s novels by the New Hardy Players, and is fondly remembered by her fellow cast members for her dramatic rendition of Hardy\u2019s poem The Ruined Maid.
