His routines have been described as \"brash and bullish\". Many of his performances begin with him acting calmly and see him gradually getting more and more enraged about what he is talking about. He came to prominence following the success of his 2010 Edinburgh Fringe show Keep Hold of the Gold. In 2014, Helm made his main acting debut as lead character Andy in the BBC Three sitcom Uncle.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Nick Helm (born 1980)"]}, {"page": "List of British comedians", "response": ["*Nick Helm, Uncle"]}, {"page": "British Comedy Awards", "response": ["* Best Comedy Breakthrough Artist: Nick Helm"]}, {"page": "British humour", "response": ["*Uncle (TV series), starring comedian and actor Nick Helm", "*Uncle (TV series), starring comedian and actor Nick Helm", "*Uncle, starring comedian and actor Nick Helm"]}, {"page": "Tim Vine", "response": ["On 25 August 2011, Vine won the prize for the second funniest joke at the Edinburgh Fringe festival.
