It follows the archangel Gabriel's fight to rid purgatory of the evil fallen angels and save the souls of its inhabitants.

It stars Andy Whitfield as Gabriel, Dwaine Stevenson as Sammael, Samantha Noble as Amitiel, and Erika Heynatz as Lilith.", "Since the beginning of time, Heaven and Hell have fought over Purgatory and the souls trapped inside it. Each side has sent seven warriors: archangels (Arcs) from Heaven, fallen angels (Fallen) from Hell. They must assume human form to enter purgatory. Hell has attained control, transforming purgatory into a dark, seedy city. The last of the seven archangels, Gabriel (Andy Whitfield), endeavors to discover what has become of his comrades and to restore the Light.", "Physical effects were also created cheaply. Instead of using expensive rain towers, the rain featured in the film's climactic scenes was created simply using hoses and unheated water. This meant that one night of production had to be wrapped three hours early because lead actor Andy Whitfield became hypothermic: his temperature dropped to 32.5 degrees Celsius (90.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Abbess described this as the hardest scene to shoot. Initially intending to make Gabriel without computer-generated effects, Abbess also tried to reproduce bullet time on a low budget by using giant props on strings, though he eventually decided CGI were more successful.", "The style of fighting in Gabriel was intended to be a \"stylised version of pub brawling.\" Shane Abbess intended for each of Gabriel's successive fights with the Fallen to be \"a whole different experience,\" and strove to shoot each one differently. The lack of time meant there was little time for the performers to rehearse fight scenes: Andy Whitfield says that some fight scenes were rehearsed for only \"three minutes before the cameras rolled.\" The hallway fight between Gabriel and Asmodeus was an example of this; the actors learned and executed a 98-move fight sequence in only an hour. Abbess states that stunt co-ordinator Kyle Rowling was \"instrumental\" to the quality of the action scenes.", "Lead actor Andy Whitfield was initially hesitant to audition because he and his wife had just had a baby, and because he would have to accept deferred payment. His agent compelled him to consider the role as it was a lead in a feature film: \"What you've always wanted to do.\" Whitfield auditioned without any expectations of getting the role, which meant \"he didn't really care as much\" and he was free to \"go for it, and go nuts\" without any pressure. After getting the role, it was his wife who encouraged him to accept it by telling him it would be an inspiring thing to tell his son.", "* Andy Whitfield as Gabriel: A committed and respected Archangel, Gabriel is occasionally reckless and stubborn. He aspires to emulate his stronger and wiser mentor, Michael. Whitfield was drawn to the character because \"everything and anything seems possible and yet he is so utterly inexperienced to deal with even the most harmless of humans.\" Initially confident that he could pull off the role \"his\" way, throughout filming Abbess pushed Whitfield to \"go to places that I would normally choose not to go to.\" This is Whitfield's first feature role."]}, {"page": "List of films set in ancient Rome", "response": ["*Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010) \u2013 with Andy Whitfield as Spartacus, Manu Bennett as Crixus, Peter Mensah as Oenomaus, John Hannah as Lentulus Batiatus, and Craig Parker as Gaius Claudius Glaber", "*Spartacus: Vengeance (2012) \u2013 sequel to Spartacus: Blood and Sand, with Liam McIntyre replacing Andy Whitfield as Spartacus, after Whitfield's unexpected death in 2011"]}, {"page": "Andy (given name)", "response": ["*Andy Whitfield (1974\u20132011), Welsh-Australian actor"]}, {"page": "Packed to the Rafters", "response": ["Recurring and minor guest stars have included Melanie Vallejo, Lieschen Pogue, Denise Roberts, Phoebe Tonkin, Andy Whitfield, Iain PF McDonald and Bernard Curry.
