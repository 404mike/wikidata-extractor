Additionally, the list included demands to hire a Black recruiter and to involve Black students and Black Pennsylvania community members in the approval process for the hiring of the recruiter, any future committees involving Black students, and instructors and courses on Black subjects.Cohen, Marge.

In addition, Walker's Statement claimed that the University had already increased Black enrollment by fifty percent; however, the previous enrollment count only included African American undergraduates, whereas the new count included Black international students and graduate students. Therefore, the Douglass Association argued that there was actually a decrease in enrollment of Black students.Cohen, Marge and Epstein, William. (1969, January 18). \"Jones Raps Douglas Action\". The Daily Collegian. https://panewsarchive.psu.edu/lccn/sn85054904/1969-01-18/ed-1/seq-1/  As a result, Rick Collins, the President of the Douglass Association, and five other representatives (Clark Arrington, David Patterson, Billie Patterson, Valerie Tartt, and Kenneth Waters), met with Walkers in Old Main to discuss the issues with his response. While the meeting between Walker and Douglass Association representatives occurred, 60 Douglass Association members waited inside of Old Main, in addition to 400 White students waiting in support outside of Old Main.Cohen, Marge.

The Daily Collegian. \"https://panewsarchive.psu.edu/lccn/sn85054904/1969-01-21/ed-1/seq-1/ Due to the lack of a concise response from Walker, 150 Douglass Association members carried 132 bricks to the second floor of Old Main, outside of Walker's office, to build a triangular-shaped wall, with one black brick at the top, and two statements tacked to the wall. The wall symbolized barriers in communication between Old Main officials and the Black community. One statement read \"Next time we won't build a wall\" and the other was a two-page statement outlining the issues in Walker's 10-page reply. The Douglass Association's statement critiques Walker's proposal from his 10-page letter that new programs would include \"Afro-American or primitive material\" because his statement assumes an analogy between African Americans and primitive.Levine, Paul.

K. Leroy Irvis, House majority leader, pledged his support of the Douglass Association and stated he would oppose state funding for Penn State until he sees a full commitment of the Administration to meet the 13 demands. In addition, Irvis stated he would call upon Penn State to appoint Black people to the Board of Trustees, see to an investigation of the hiring and enrollment policies, and visit Penn State in March to speak with President Walker.Epstein, William.
