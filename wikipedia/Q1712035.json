We have done that with great success, and the peacetime patrols have achieved some remarkable results, but there has been a price to pay because of the age of those ships.\"Defence Committee, sixth report, The Royal Navy's Surface Fleet: Current Issues -  report, together with the proceedings of the committee, minutes of evidence and memoranda, pub HMSO, 21 June 1989, minutes of evidence pages\u00a012\u201313."]}, {"page": "HMS Bacchante (F69)", "response": ["Shortly after the war was over the crew was sent ashore to aid the local populace in the disaster recovery operations, providing navigational landmarks for ships located in Stanley Sound and attempting to refloat the high commissioner's barge (but failing); also providing well deserved respite for Royal Marines and navy divers (hot food and accommodation).
