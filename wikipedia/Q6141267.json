He took a particular interest in the establishment of public libraries.\nJames Picton was born in Liverpool to William Picton, a joiner and timber merchant, and entered his father's business at the age of 13. He later joined the office of Daniel Stewart, an architect and surveyor, eventually taking over the business.  Picton designed some important buildings in Liverpool, including the corn exchange and Richmond Buildings, an office block, now demolished.He became a member of the town council in 1849, and in 1851 a member (and later chairman) of the Wavertree local board. He started to campaign for a public library for the borough and in 1852 an Act of Parliament was obtained to allow the raising of a penny rate for a public library and museum.  William Brown provided the buildings for the library and museum in 1860.  In 1879 the corporation added to the library a reading room which was called the Picton Reading Room, modelled on the British Museum Reading Room.  Picton was the first chairman of the library and museum committee, which was founded in 1851, and he remained in this position until his death.Picton married Sarah Pooley. Their son also James Allanson Picton eschewed his father's architectural practice and was eventually elected as MP for Leicester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Picton", "response": ["* James Picton (1805\u20131889), Liverpool architect"]}, {"page": "Wavertree", "response": ["Built in 1796, and later modified by prominent local resident and architect Sir James Picton, it was once used to detain local drunks.

The first structure on the site had been a sandstone mansion, built in 1256 on the shore of the River Mersey.  Its first owner is not known, but by 1360 it was owned by Sir Robert Lathom.  By beginning of the 15th\u00a0century it was owned by Sir John Stanley.  In 1406 Sir John gained permission from King Henry V build a fortified house, which was named the Tower of Liverpool.  The Stanley family later became the Earls of Derby.  By 1737 the house was being leased from the Earl of Derby by Liverpool Corporation.  In 1745 part of it was converted into a prison, and the upper rooms were used for civic functions.  In 1774 the Corporation bought the building outright.  A new prison was built in Great Howard Street, and the building ceased to be used for this purpose in 1811.  It was demolished in 1819 to allow widening of Water Street.  The site was used for a row of warehouses, until in 1846 the first structure to be known as Tower Buildings was built to a design by Sir\u00a0James Picton.  The present building was designed in 1906 by Walter Aubrey Thomas, and its construction was completed in 1910.  Thomas also designed the Royal Liver Building.
