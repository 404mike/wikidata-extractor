These paintings became a major influence on the development of the European Symbolist movement.Treuherz et al. (2003), pp. 52\u201354. In them, Rossetti's depiction of women became almost obsessively stylised. He portrayed his new lover Fanny Cornforth as the epitome of physical eroticism, whilst Jane Burden, the wife of his business partner William Morris, was glamorised as an ethereal goddess. \"As in Rossetti's previous reforms, the new kind of subject appeared in the context of a wholesale reconfiguration of the practice of painting, from the most basic level of materials and techniques up to the most abstract or conceptual level of the meanings and ideas that can be embodied in visual form.\"  These new works were based not on medievalism, but on the Italian High Renaissance artists of Venice, Titian and Veronese.Treuherz et al.

Before long Rossetti wrote that he too was ill and asked Caine to go to London planning to return to Cumbria with him. By the time Caine arrived in London Rossetti had changed his mind and instead Caine became Rossetti's housemate. Early in September, persuaded by friends and family Rossetti spent a month with Caine at St John's in the Vale, accompanied by Fanny Cornforth. Whilst there, Caine recited a local myth to Rossetti. The myth was to become the inspiration for his first novel The Shadow of a Crime. He was also delivering weekly lectures in Liverpool."]}, {"page": "Elephant and Castle", "response": ["Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Fanny Cornforth, who apparently took her nickname \"elephant\" from the place, as well as Elizabeth Siddal, Samuel Palmer, George Tinworth, Robert Browning, Sarah Wardroper and Octavia Hill are also thoughts to have lived in the area."]}, {"page": "1859 in art", "response": ["* Dante Gabriel Rossetti \u2013 Bocca Baciata, the first of his portraits of single female figures (Fanny Cornforth)"]}, {"page": "1856 in art", "response": ["* August 25 \u2013 Dante Gabriel Rossetti first encounters Fanny Cornforth (Sarah Cox) in a London pleasure garden; the following day he sketches her head in his studio for the figure of a prostitute in his unfinished painting Found"]}, {"page": "1835 in art", "response": ["*January 3 \u2013 Fanny Cornforth, born Sarah Cox, English artists' model (died 1909)"]}, {"page": "1835 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 3 January \u2013 Fanny Cornforth, born Sarah Cox, artists' model (died 1909)"]}]}}
