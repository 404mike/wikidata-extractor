He was educated first at George Watson's College. However, in 1923 his father was transferred to manage the Bank of Scotland branch in the small village of Bonar Bridge in Sutherland, close to his family home in Dornoch. Hamish was then educated in the one-room village school. In 1932 he was Dux (top pupil) of the county of Sutherland. Wishing to study medicine but needing qualifications which could not be provided in his village school he crammed physics and chemistry alone and passed the university entrance examination, but as medicine was oversubscribed, he first studied for a Bachelor of Science degree at Glasgow University. During this course he spent the summers with Edward Provan Cathcart and David Cuthbertson and acquired an interest in metabolism and nutrition. He graduated BSc in 1936 with First Class Honours, publishing that year the first of over 700 scientific papers. He returned to the medical course and qualified MB ChB in September 1939.http://rse.mtcserver6.com/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/munro_hamish.pdf"]}, {"page": "A. T.
