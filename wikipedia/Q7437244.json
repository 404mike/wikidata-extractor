Originally from London he was adopted and grew up in Springfield, Chelmsford, where he attended The Tyrrells Primary school, and The Boswells School, between productions. At an early age he demonstrated a great talent for both dancing and gymnastics, and was a professional model at just four.\nHe achieved fame in the early 1980s after appearing on the Channel 4 show Minipops, and recorded several albums with them. He went on to appear in the London stage version of Bugsy Malone. His subsequent career included a number of other stage and television productions: Cats, Fame, Five Guys Named Moe, From the Top, Ragtime, and appeared on the Royal Variety Performance. In 1991, he became a co-presenter of the long-running television magazine show, That's Life!, notable for being the first \u2013 and ultimately only \u2013 black presenter of the show.In 1995, Sherrin went missing after reports of erratic behaviour.
