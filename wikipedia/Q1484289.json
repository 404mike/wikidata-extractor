Born in Cambridge in 1911, he was largely self-educated, and developed an early interest in books and natural history. His initial work experience was at a Cambridge bookshop, but he also had a position as an assistant in the university botany department. At the age of 29 he married Eldwyth Ruth Alford, who later became his collaborator. He died in London in 2001.\nWhile at the bookshop, he was offered a position as a librarian at the Royal Horticultural Society in London (1933\u20131952). From there he moved to the Natural History Museum as a scientific officer in the botany department (1952\u20131976). After his retirement, he continued working there, writing, and serving on a number of professional bodies related to his work, including the Linnean Society, of which he became president. He also taught botany at Cambridge University as a visiting professor (1977\u20131983).\nStearn is known for his work in botanical taxonomy and botanical history, particularly classical botanical literature, botanical illustration and for his studies of the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus. His best known books are his Dictionary of Plant Names for Gardeners, a popular guide to the scientific names of plants, and his Botanical Latin for scientists.\nStearn received many honours for his work, at home and abroad, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1997. Considered one of the most eminent British botanists of his time, he is remembered by an essay prize in his name from the Society for the History of Natural History, and a named cultivar of Epimedium, one of many genera he produced monographs on. He is the botanical authority for over 400 plants that he named and described.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carl Linnaeus", "response": ["During Linnaeus's time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught many devoted students, 17 of whom he called \"apostles\". They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition.Blunt (2004), pp. 189\u2013190. To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus's system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished.Broberg (2006), pp. 37\u201339. Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland.Anderson (1997), pp. 92\u201393. The British botanist William T. Stearn notes, without Linnaeus's new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens.Blunt (2004), pp. 184\u2013185. Many of the apostles died during their expeditions."]}, {"page": "John Ray", "response": ["** Facsimile edition 1973, Ray Society, London. With introduction by William T. Stearn.

In searching literature it is well to remember that the name commonly is misspelt \"Raphiolepsis\". The genus is closely related to Eriobotrya (loquats), so closely in fact, that members of the two genera have hybridised with each other; for example the \"Coppertone loquat\" is a hybrid of Eriobotrya deflexa X Rhaphiolepis indica. The common name hawthorn, originally specifically applied to the related genus Crataegus, now also appears in the common names for some Rhaphiolepis species. For example, Rhaphiolepis indica often is called \"Indian hawthorn\", and Rhaphiolepis umbellata, \"Yeddo hawthorn\"."]}, {"page": "Victoria Medal of Honour", "response": ["** William T.
