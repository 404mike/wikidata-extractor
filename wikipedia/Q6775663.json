Their motorcycle skidded on oil and the two were thrown off, knocked unconscious and sustained injuries. Both were left waiting with police, who arrived shortly after the accident, for an ambulance for approximately 90 minutes after the accident. The police were reportedly unable to take them to a hospital in their cars due to the two men's injuries and a supposed lack of insurance coverage if something were to happen while en route. At some point, another ambulance had stopped and passed by but was unable to attend to them possibly because it had been full or was attending to another emergency. Eventually an ambulance arrived at 3:59 pm almost an hour and a half after the accident as other ambulances had been diverted to higher priority calls. They were taken to West Middlesex University Hospital. Martin Herdman suffered a torn ligament on his ankle and additional cuts and bruises."]}, {"page": "1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["|SR ||11|| Martin Herdman", "|SR ||11||Martin Herdman"]}, {"page": "Above Suspicion (TV series)", "response": ["* Martin Herdman as D.C.I.
