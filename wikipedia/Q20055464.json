These reserved powers were intended to protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, it would have been extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so would have probably caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare."]}, {"page": "Annan Plan", "response": ["Following the talks in New York, four more rounds of proximity talks were held in Geneva: 31 January \u2013 8 February 24 July \u2013 4 August, 12\u201326 September, and 1\u201310 November 2000..

See also pages 62\u20133.", "According to Claire Palley, problems and delays were created in this phase by Denkta\u015f's insistence on \"producing proposals well beyond the Plan's parameters\".

After consultation with the Turkish government, Denkta\u015f agreed to confer full negotiating authority on Talat the Prime Minister, and his son Serdar Denkta\u015f, the Foreign Minister. According to Claire Palley, the Greek Cypriot side was pressured by \"the UN and various Powers\" to treat Talat and Serdar Denkta\u015f as leaders, but in reality Rauf Denkta\u015f remained leader of the Turkish Cypriots \"able at any time to withdraw his negotiating authority or to veto decisions.\", p. 122.", "* \"... had he [Annan] been more closely involved in the details, [he] would not have wished his name to be historically associated with such departures from international law and human rights standards. ...a significant opportunity to reach an agreed settlement was lost as a result of the conduct of the UN Secretariat, advised by the USA and the UK....

As a result of this pro-rural view, they argued, Mugabe and the ZANU\u2013PF demonstrated an anti-urban bias. The English academic Claire Palley met Mugabe in 1962, later noting that \"he struck me as not so much a doctrinaire Marxist but an old-fashioned African nationalist\", while Tekere claimed that for Mugabe, Marxism-Leninism was \"just rhetoric\" with \"no genuine vision or belief behind it\". Carington noted that while Mugabe used Marxist rhetoric during the Lancaster House negotiations, \"of course he didn't actually practise what he preached, did he? Once in office he became a capitalist\". Mugabe has stated that \"socialism has to be much more Christian than capitalism\".

Beadle's biographer Claire Palley describes him as \"a learned, fair but also adventurous judge\". He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1957 New Year Honours. In August 1959, amid rising black nationalism and opposition to the Federation, particularly in the two northern territories, Beadle chaired a three-man tribunal on the Southern Rhodesian government's preventive detention of black nationalist leaders without trial during the disturbances. He upheld the government's actions, reporting that the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress had disseminated \"subversive propaganda\", encouraged racial hatred, intimidated people into joining and undermined the authority of tribal chiefs, government officials and police.", "\"A short, stocky man of ruddy complexion with a toothbrush moustache,\" Claire Palley writes, \"Beadle had a blunt manner, looking hard at all whom he encountered. His drive and enthusiasm were overwhelming, whether at work, in charitable activities, or as a courageous hunter and fisherman. He had a warm family life and many friends.\" According to J.R.T. Wood, Wilson \"hated Beadle perhaps because Beadle was clever but spoke his mind\"; the British Prime Minister described Beadle to Lord Alport shortly after UDI as combining \"the courage of a lion\" with \"the smartness of a fox\". In Lord Blake's History of Rhodesia, Beadle is characterised as \"an irrepressible, bouncy extrovert, who does not always perceive the reaction which he causes in others.\" Garfield Todd, Premier of Southern Rhodesia from 1956 to 1958, saw Beadle as \"impulsive\" and \"always inclined to overstate his case\"."]}, {"page": "Hamlyn Lectures", "response": ["|Claire Palley"]}, {"page": "Palley", "response": ["*Claire Palley (born 1931), South African academic and lawyer"]}, {"page": "List of St Anne's College, Oxford people", "response": ["*1984\u20131991 Claire Palley"]}, {"page": "Cherryl Fountain", "response": ["Works by Fountain have been varied, and include the Baptismal Roll (2000) which is an illustrated manuscript now kept at Selling Church, Kent, and portraits of Nigel Nicolson and Claire Palley.
