The company was focused on producing large-scale photogrammetric and geophysical maps, mostly for the Government of Canada.  In the early 1960s, Tomlinson and the company were asked to produce a map for site-location analysis in an east African nation. Tomlinson immediately recognized that the new automated computer technologies might be applicable and even necessary to complete such a detail-oriented task more effectively and efficiently than humans. Eventually, Spartan met with IBM offices in Ottawa to begin developing a relationship to bridge the previous gap between geographic data and computer services. Tomlinson brought his geographic knowledge to the table as IBM brought computer programming and data management."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Roger Tomlinson, founder of Geographic Information Systems President, Tomlinson Associates Ltd, Consulting Geographers.
