However Slaven picked up a calf strain in pre-season and lost his first team place to Stuart Ripley. He regained his first team place early in September after scoring three goals as a substitute against Portsmouth and Oxford United. On 28 September, he scored the opening goal in a 2\u20131 victory over rivals Sunderland. However Lawrence felt that Slaven was too individualistic, and in November he spent \u00a3700,000 on Hull City striker Andy Payton, who he hoped would prove to be an effective striker partner for Paul Wilkinson. Payton scored on his debut against Bristol City on 23 November, but Slaven claimed the other two goals in a 3\u20131 victory, and Payton left the field on a stretcher after picking up an injury. However Slaven injured his knee in January and after undergoing surgery was ruled out of action for five weeks. He scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win over Brighton on 21 March, but fell out with Lawrence and was dropped for the end of season promotion run-in. He returned for the crucial final game of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers however, and set up a late Jon Gittens equaliser, before a late winner from Wilkinson secured a 2\u20131 victory and the second automatic promotion place for Middlesbrough."]}, {"page": "Fareham Town F.C.", "response": ["*  Jon Gittens"]}, {"page": "South Coast derby", "response": ["| Jon Gittens "]}, {"page": "Trevor Morley", "response": ["In 1996 Morley suffered a severe head injury playing against Portsmouth.
