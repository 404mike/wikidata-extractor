He was born in East Ham, Essex, and started his career with his hometown club Barking Town. In May 1922, Lammus signed for Football League First Division side West Bromwich Albion. However, he did not make a senior appearance for the club and joined newly promoted Second Division outfit Nelson in July 1923, as a replacement for Scottish right-back John Steel.\n\nLammus made his debut for Nelson on 27 August 1923 in the 0\u20131 defeat away at Stockport County. He kept his place in the team for eight matches before being dropped following the 2\u20130 win against Stoke on 29 September 1923. Player-manager David Wilson subsequently played himself in the right-back position for the several matches until the arrival of Tom Lilley from Huddersfield Town in November 1923.\nNelson were relegated to the Third Division North at the end of the 1923\u201324 season, and Lammus was one of several players released by the club. He then moved into non-League football with Nuneaton Town and later Tunbridge Wells Rangers. By August 1932, he was playing amateur football for the New Beckton Baptist Church in West Ham. Lammus died in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, in early 1982 at the age of 83.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1923\u201324 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|William Lammus"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["While there were several changed to the playing staff, the core of the team that had played in the Second Division remained intact. Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top goalscorer in each of the previous three seasons, was retained along with captain Clem Rigg, Welsh half-back Jack Newnes and goalkeeper Harry Abbott. The two most senior squad members, David Wilson and goalkeeper Joseph Birds, retired from professional football aged 40 and 36 respectively. Inside forward Dick Crawshaw, who had been the team's second-highest scorer in 1923\u201324 with five goals, moved to Stalybridge Celtic.Dykes (2009), p. 30 Scottish forward Mike McCulloch ended his two-year association with the club by joining Chesterfield on a free transfer, while half-back Leigh Collins signed for New Brighton. Other players, including William Lammus and Ernest Gillibrand, left Nelson having failed to establish themselves in the first-team during their time with the club.Dykes (2009), p. 37 Manager Wilson spent a total of \u00a3750 (\u00a3 as of 2011) on new players in the summer of 1924. Billy Bottrill and Bill Ellerington arrived from Middlesbrough, while Barrow full-back James Phizacklea was signed to bolster the defensive line.Dykes (2009), p. 58 Several young players were acquired from local non-League football during the close season, including Ambrose Harris from Briercliffe and Billy Harper, formerly of Feniscowles. The Nelson squad was considered by the local newspaper to be stronger than the one which had won the Third Division North two seasons earlier.", "| William Lammus"]}, {"page": "Lammus, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Lammus"]}]}}
