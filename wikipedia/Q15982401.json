She is thought to be the first British woman to obtain a doctorate in chemistry.\n\nOn the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), 8 April 1991, a sample of the original crystals synthesised by Humphrey for her PhD were sent to them by the Swiss Committee of Chemistry, together with a modern CD spectrum of a solution of one crystal. This box of crystals remains on display in the exhibition room of the RSC.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1901 in science", "response": ["* Edith Humphrey becomes (probably) the first British woman to obtain a doctorate in chemistry, at the University of Zurich.\u00dcber die Bindungsstelle der Metalle in ihren Verbindungen und \u00fcber Dinitrito\u00e4thylendiaminkobaltisalze."]}, {"page": "1875 in science", "response": ["* September 11 \u2013 Edith Humphrey (died 1978), English chemist"]}, {"page": "1978 in science", "response": ["* February 25 \u2013 Edith Humphrey (b. 1875), English chemist."]}, {"page": "Chemical Society", "response": ["In 1904, Edith Humphrey, thought to be the first British woman to gain a doctorate in chemistry (at the University of Zurich), was one of nineteen women chemists to petition the Chemical Society for admission of women to fellowship.

Smedley, Freund, and Whiteley led the petition. Smedley attended the King Edward VI High School as did Thomas and Hartle. Freund was a demonstrator and a lecturer at Newnham College, Cambridge between 1887 and 1912, as were Elizabeth Eleanor Field, Dorothy Marshall, and Mildred Gostling. Thomas, Field, Whiteley, and Gostling spent time at Royal Holloway College, from where there were two additional petitioners: Margaret Seward and Sibyl Widdows. Clare de Brereton Evans and Millicent Taylor attended the Cheltenham Ladies' College, Cheltenham and Taylor had connections with the University of Bristol, where Emily Fortey and Katherine Williams studied. Lucy Boole studied at the London School of Medicine for Women and Katherine Burke studied at University College London under the supervision of William Ramsay - both of these women knew de Brereton Evans. Grace Toynbee studied at the University of Birmingham, and was possibly connected with Hartle. Two petitioners Edith Humphrey and Alice Smith have unknown connections to the remainder, but it is proposed that they were connected by male chemists keen to promote their cause, such William Ramsay."]}]}}
