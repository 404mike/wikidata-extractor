Robert Cawkwell of Sheffield was responsible for the interior designs when, in 1935, Nicholson, a Sheffield stockbroker, opened the hall as a country club, investing \u00a380,000 in its art deco renovation. The interior was dramatically modernised and featured a mirror-walled ballroom and an elaborate and versatile state-of-the-art lighting system. There was also a heated outdoor swimming pool, and membership fees ranged from three to seven guineas. Nicholson built an airfield in the grounds, enlisting the help of the pilot Captain Tom Campbell Black, who with C. W. A. Scott had won the air race from Mildenhall to Melbourne in 1935. Black was a well-connected socialite, and it was through him that the then Prince of Wales learned of the club, flying there in his private Dragon aircraft, which bore the royal insignia. The aviator Amy Johnson also patronised the club. Other facilities included an 18-hole golf course, the design of which Nicholson entrusted to the celebrity golfer John S.F. Morrison, championship-standard squash courts, and tennis courts. The  swimming pool was built by the Sheffield-based construction company B. Powell and Son.

The British bands played a softer version of the swing jazz popular in the USA during the 1930s and 1940s.", "Lenner began performing solo at charity shows, benefits and social clubs. She was soon heard by scouting agents and by 1933 she was offered engagements in London. She appeared at Jack's Club, and the Cabaret Club, where she had to perform with a megaphone. At another engagement in 1934, at Murray's Club in Soho\u2019s Beak Street, she was heard by Savoy Hotel bandleader Carroll Gibbons.", "Gibbons was so impressed with Lenner's voice, that he invited her to record with his group for a Radio Luxembourg broadcast sponsored by Hartley's Jam. The story goes that the session was booked for 9:30am the next morning, but Lenner was late for what was her first really big break. Luckily, Carroll was so keen that he booked another session with Lenner for later that day. The broadcasts were successful, and Lenner was given a three-year contract to sing with Gibbons at the Savoy Hotel. The Savoy management initially objected to the presence of a female vocalist, but Gibbons believed in Lenner and he refused to give in.

She recorded over 150 titles with Carroll Gibbons, both with the full band and with a smaller contingent which Carroll called his \"Boy Friends\". It was with the Boy Friends that Lenner made the Hartley's Jam broadcasts mentioned above. These radio programmes were introduced by Jimmy Dyrenforth who introduced Lenner as the \"girl friend\".", "Lenner spoke very fondly of Carroll Gibbons. In her own words: \"To work with, he was the most understanding, gentle and kind person. The boys respected and loved him. He was not only the boss but interested in their private lives and was a friend to all of them. Carroll\u2019s boys all looked good and were very versatile, especially George Melachrino who played oboe, viola and sax and Reg Leopold who played violin, viola and sax.
