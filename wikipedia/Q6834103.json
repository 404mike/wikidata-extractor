He then attended Balliol College, Oxford, where he read history and won the 1912 Stanhope essay prize on the political career of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Before the First World War, Sadleir and his father were keen collectors of art, and purchased works by young English artists such as Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. They were amongst the first collectors (and certainly the first English collectors) of the paintings of the Russian-born German Expressionist artist Wassily Kandinsky.  In 1913, both Sadleir and his father travelled to Germany to meet Kandinsky in Munich.Tom Steele, Alfred Orage and the Leeds Arts Club (1893\u20131923) (Aldershot, Ashgate 1990) p. 179. This visit led to Sadleir translating into English Kandinsky's seminal written work on expressionism, Concerning the Spiritual in Art in 1914. This was one of the first coherent arguments for abstract art in the English language and the translation by Sadleir was seen as both crucial to understanding Kandinsky's theories about abstract art and as a key text in the history of modernism. Extracts from it were published in the Vorticist literary magazine BLAST in 1914, and it remained one of the most influential art texts of the first decades of the twentieth century."]}, {"page": "1911 Coronation Honours", "response": ["*Michael Ernest Sadler, Esq."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India", "response": ["*Michael Ernest Sadler"]}, {"page": "International Moral Education Congress", "response": ["thumbnail|Sir Michael Ernest Sadler, president of the First Congress"]}, {"page": "1919 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Michael Ernest Sadler  Chairman of Calcutta University Commission"]}, {"page": "Jane Ingham", "response": ["Ingham had four siblings.
