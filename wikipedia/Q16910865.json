He was persuaded to return for a farewell appearance in a friendly match against Selkirk at Ettrick Park in 1926. A few minutes into the game, Mercer suffered a fatal heart attack. Crossan's end was similar; he succumbed to his gas injuries in 1933. Sinclair fared better and continued to play football into the 1920s, including a spell in the United States.
