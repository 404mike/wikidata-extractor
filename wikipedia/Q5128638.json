It published his collection The Mystery (1913). Hodgson received the Edmond de Polignac Prize in 1914, for a musical setting of The Song of Honour, and was included in the Georgian Poetry anthologies.

To aid his recovery, the Nashes moved to Dymchurch which they had first visited in 1919 and where he painted seascapes, the seawall and landscapes of Romney Marsh. The seawall at Dymchurch became a key location in Nash's work. The conflict between land and sea depicted in the seawall paintings at Dymchurch recalled elements of Nash's paintings on the Western Front and were also influenced by his grief at the death of his friend Claud Lovat Fraser in June 1921. In 1922, Nash produced Places, a volume of seven wood engravings for which he also designed the cover, cut the lettering and wrote the text. At this time he also began painting floral still-lifes as well as continuing his landscape paintings, most notably with Chilterns under Snow in 1923. Throughout 1924 and 1925 Nash taught part-time at the Design School at the Royal College of Art, where his students included both Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden. In 1924 he held a commercially successful exhibition at the Leicester Galleries. This allowed the Nashes to spend the winter near Nice and visit Florence and Pisa at the start of 1925 after which they moved home to Iden near Rye in Sussex. Iden and the Romney Marshes became the settings for a series of paintings by Nash, most notably Winter Sea painted in 1925 and reworked in 1937. In 1927 Nash was elected to the London Artists' Association and in 1928 held another successful exhibition of his paintings at the Leicester Galleries whilst an exhibition of his wood-engravings was held at the Redfern Gallery the same year. The Leicester Galleries exhibition was notable for showing Nash turning away from his popular landscapes and beginning to explore abstraction in his work."]}, {"page": "Red House, Buntingford", "response": ["The Red House is a Queen Anne style house built around 1710 opposite the intersection of Norfolk Road and High Street in Buntingford, Hertfordshire, England.

Haldane set his first novel The Wooings of Jezebel Pettyfer in Jamaica and, unusually for the time, it had a West Indian hero. It was published the year he moved into Sarah's house. His next novel, The Masterfolk, was a witty portrait of bohemian life in London and Paris in the 1890s. Published in 1903, it was also the year he married Mabel Anne Plumridge (1861-1931), daughter of Admiral Sir James Hanway Plumridge and his third wife Georgina Skinner, whose brother was another army officer, Thomas Skinner. He continued to write for periodicals, combining his interest in art with critiques of exhibitions; writings which are said to have drawn the attention of Whistler. But it was his books on art, particularly his biographies of artists which became his primary source of income. Between 1903 and 1909 he wrote biographies of Henrik Ibsen, Whistler, Henry Irving, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard and \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, as well as several histories of art movements, numerous illustrations and book covers.
