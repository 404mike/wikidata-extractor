He is a centre back, although he is capable of playing at right back as well.\nWheater started his professional career at Middlesbrough in 2004, having graduated through the club's youth teams. He had three loan spells away from Middlesbrough during the 2006\u201307 season; at Doncaster Rovers, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Darlington (loan). An injury to Jonathan Woodgate at the start of the following season saw Wheater become a regular player for Middlesbrough, and he would make a total of 140 league appearances for the club before switching to Bolton Wanderers in January 2011.\nWheater has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels.

During the 2007\u201308 pre-season Woodgate suffered an injury that allowed fellow hometown defender David Wheater to start in his place during pre-season.

He started the subsequent three Euro 2008 qualifiers, against Andorra and Macedonia. Downing hoped to have proven many of his critics wrong after Fabio Capello became the third successive England manager to give him an England cap, on 26 March 2008 in a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to France. He was also called up (alongside Middlesbrough teammate David Wheater) for Capello's friendlies against United States and Trinidad and Tobago, where he received the nod ahead of Ashley Young. His performance justified his selection by contributing with the first two goals and won praise from the press who had previously slated his inclusion in the squad. A few months after Capello took charge of England, the Italian manager stated that he had been most impressed by Downing. He was chosen again by Capello to replace Aaron Lennon for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on 12 October 2010. During his second season with Aston Villa, Downing began to feature regularly for England under Capello."]}, {"page": "Robert Huth", "response": ["Huth underwent ankle surgery in the summer of 2007 in order to fix his problem; he consulted a specialist after failing to recover.

On 12 August 2007, after an injury to first choice Fulham goalkeeper Antti Niemi in the warm-up before The Cottagers game at The Emirates against Arsenal, Warner was forced to be a last minute replacement for Niemi, but despite the circumstances Warner impressed and kept countless shots at bay, but two late goals denied Warner a clean sheet and Fulham lost the game 2\u20131. In the following game against Bolton Wanderers on 15 August 2007, Warner dropped the ball after collecting it from a Nicky Hunt throw-in and gave former teammate Hei\u00f0ar Helguson a goal for Bolton, but somewhat redeemed himself after pulling off a full-stretch save from Nicolas Anelka and Fulham won 2\u20131. On 18 August against Middlesbrough, Warner gifted debutant Mido a goal, after Warner mistimed a shot from the Egyptian and the ball bounced off his chest and rolled into the back of the net, as in the Bolton game, he somewhat redeemed himself after pulling off a full-stretch save from central defender David Wheater. Warner's mistake this time affected the score, with Middlesbrough winning 2\u20131. With Niemi still injured and Warner regularly making mistakes, Fulham manager Lawrie Sanchez, brought in Kasey Keller on 23 August 2007, to provide cover and competition for Warner and Niemi. On 25 August 2007 Warner sat on the bench for the game at Aston Villa. On 28 August 2007, Warner played and kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over Shrewsbury Town at the New Meadow.

Since making his return to the first team, Mills won his place back in the side and partnered either David Wheater and Tim Ream. His pairing in the central defence with Ream and Wheater was praised by Manager Freedman. During a 3\u20132 loss against Wigan Athletic on 15 December 2013, he was penalised for handball that saw the opposition team successfully converted the penalty. After the match, Manager Freedman criticised the referee over the handball decision, while Mills was critical of the decision, saying: \"The ball came over my head and I'm facing my own goal, I got a push in my back and the referee gave a corner. All of a sudden I see he has given a penalty because the linesman on the other side of the pitch has seen the ball intentionally hit my hand. I haven't got eyes in the back of my head but how does he change his mind? I'm gutted for the fans, obviously.\" It wasn't until on 11 January 2014 when he scored his first goal for the club, in a 1\u20131 draw against Nottingham Forest. However, Mills was sidelined when he suffered a minor knee problem during a match against Watford on 22 February 2014. After being sidelined for a month, Mills made his first team return, where he assisted Jermaine Beckford to score the only goal in the game, in a 1\u20130 win over Barnsley on 12 April 2014.

Shortly after, he was placed available on loan, as his first team opportunities was limited under the management of Neil Lennon. After returning from a loan spell at Nottingham Forest, he returned to the club's first team, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1\u20131 draw against Eastleigh in third round of the FA Cup on 9 January 2016. Trotter started against Eastleigh in the third round replay of the FA Cup and helped them beat Eastleigh 3\u20132 to progress to the next round. Since returning to the first team, he regained his first team place for the side, playing in the midfield position. His return to the first team had convinced Manager Lennon that he was wrong to leave out Trotter.

After the match, Trotter said about the club's recent situation, saying: \" We think about the fans because they pay a lot of money to watch us. They have put their cash into this club over the years and no-one knows where it has gone. The club is in a bad financial state. They have the most right to be upset because their money has been misused. Of course we feel for them. They have been very understanding and have supported us through every single game. Since I have been back, this was probably the first time we've been booed. It is a credit to them. This isn't for us, we need to keep going for them.\" Following a 3\u20131 loss against Brentford on 6 April 2016, Trotter caused controversy along with David Wheater when they made \"an abusive finger gesture\" on camera; which he apologised afterwards. As a result, the pair was disciplined by the club. Shortly after, Bolton Wanderers was relegated to League One after losing 4\u20131 to Derby County on 9 April 2016. Soon after, Trotter was dropped from the first team and never played again for the rest of the season.

Seb continued to impress with assured performances at the heart of the Middlesbrough's defence with a cool display in the draw at Preston North End and another commanding showing in the 2\u20130 victory over Scunthorpe United on 1 February 2011 in which the highlight was a fine measured lob by prolific goalscorer Kris Boyd which brought about his 200th career goal. For his performance, Hines signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2013. The following month on 8 March 2011, Hines scored his first league goal for the club, in a 2\u20131 win over Derby County and afterwards, Hines was given a handful of first team appearances until he was involved in a collision with Connor Wickham, in a 3\u20133 draw against Ipswich Town on 12 April 2011, resulting him a broken jaw and after a successful operation on his jaw, Hines, however, was out for the rest of the season.
