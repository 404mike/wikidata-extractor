On unjust enrichment as a 'unifying legal concept', see the judgment of Deane J in Pavey & Mathews v Paul (1987) 162 CLR 221. Where an individual is unjustly enriched, the law imposes an obligation upon the recipient to make restitution, subject to defences such as change of position. Liability for an unjust (or unjustified) enrichment arises irrespective of wrongdoing on the part of the recipient. The concept of unjust enrichment can be traced to Roman law and the maxim that \"no one should be benefited at another's expense\": nemo locupletari potest aliena iactura or nemo locupletari debet cum aliena iactura.", "In systems of law derived from the English common law, the historical core of the law of unjust enrichment lies in quasi-contract. These were common law (as distinct from equitable) claims giving rise to a personal liability to pay the money value of a benefit received from another. Legal scholars from Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard at the turn of the 20th century began to rationalise these disparate actions into a coherent body of law.See generally: Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History (4th edition); Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Andrew Burrows, The Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011). The principle said to underlie these actions was eventually recognized as unjust enrichment.See, e.g., Pavey & Mathews v Paul [1987] (Australia); Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale [1991] (England). Subsequent scholarship has sought to expand the explanatory power of the principle of unjust enrichment and it is now often said (albeit not without controversy)See, e.g., Bofinger v Kingsway [2009 239 CLR 269] to encompass both common law and equitable claims.See, e.g., Mitchell and Watterson, Subrogation: Law and Practice (2nd Edition).", "** Professor Graham Virgo"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge", "response": ["* Graham Virgo, Professor of English Private Law since 2007"]}, {"page": "Vinerian Scholarship", "response": ["* Graham Virgo (1988), Downing College, Cambridge \u2013 Christ Church, Oxford"]}, {"page": "Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley", "response": ["As Law Lord, he furthered the cause of restitution that he had developed academically. In Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd, he gave judicial recognition to the proposition that unjust enrichment is an independent branch of private law. Graham Virgo, who has disagreed with the reasoning in Lipkin Gorman, nevertheless described it as \"probably the most important dictum in the modern law of restitution\". His judgment in Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln CC was described by Lord Hoffmann as \"one of the most distinguished of his luminous contributions to this branch of the law\" and by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, who dissented, as containing \"yet another major contribution to the law of restitution\".

Of course, the law did not develop in a vacuum: the American Law Institute drafted a Restatement of the Law of Restitution in 1937. The first major practitioner text in England appeared in 1966, written by Robert Goff and Gareth Jones.R Goff and G Jones, The Law of Restitution (1966) It was Robert Goff (by this time Lord Goff) who gave the leading judgment in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd over two decades later. Professor Peter Birks was instrumental in promoting the autonomy of unjust enrichment within the law of obligations in his seminal work Introduction to the Law of Restitution. Academic writing continues to be heavily cited by the highest courts, particularly the more recent work of Professor Andrew Burrows and Professor Graham Virgo, as well as modern editions of Goff & Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment, now edited by Professor Charles Mitchell, Professor Paul Mitchell, and Dr Stephen Watterson. A good example of the close relationship between the academy and the profession in the development of this area of law is seen in the recent publication of the Restatement of the English Law of Unjust Enrichment.", "* Must there be correspondence between the claimant's loss and the defendant's gain? Courts have generally adopted the view that there need not be complete 'equivalence' between loss and gain, provided there is a causal connection.See further: Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015) 118; McInnes, 'At the Plaintiff's Expense': Quantifying Restitutionary Relief' [1998] Cambridge Law Journal 472; Andrew Burrows, The Law of Restitution (2011, 3rd ed) 64-5. This issue is related to the question whether there should be a 'passing on' defence: that is, whether a claimant should be able to recover from the defendant despite the claimant having 'passed on' the loss to third parties. There is no such defence in England, Australia or Canada,Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Birmingham City Council [1996] 4 All ER 733 (England); Kingstreet Investments Ltd v New Brunswick [2007] 1 SCR 3 (Canada) although there are some statutory provisions providing for such a defence in each jurisdiction.", "The prevailing academic viewGraham Virgo, The Principles of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015) at 125-6; Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, eds., Goff & Jones' Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011) at [9-02].

This view has been rejected by the House of Lords.See Foskett v McKeown [2001]. They instead held that such claims were a matter of vindicating property rights, a view long associated with Professor Virgo.Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015). Even if not (for the foreseeable future) a part of the law of unjust enrichment, a claim to the traceable proceeds of one's property remains part of the law of restitution. The remainder of this section concerns proprietary restitution. Proprietary restitution is where a claimant who is entitled to restitution is awarded a proprietary remedy.", "**Professor Graham Virgo"]}, {"page": "Change of position", "response": ["*Graham Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015)"]}, {"page": "Restitution in English law", "response": ["As the law currently stands,See Foskett v McKeown [2000] UKHL 29 and Bank of Cyprus v Menelaou [2015] UKSC 66 for affirmation of the distinction between (a) personal actions to reverse unjust enrichment; and (b) proprietary actions in which a claimant seeks a proprietary remedy in respect of a traceable substitute of property once owned by the claimant. The latter is a case founded on the vindication of the claimant's original (and subsisting) property rights. A prominent supporter of this view has been Professor Graham Virgo (see, e.g., Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015).
