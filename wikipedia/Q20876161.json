He married around 1550 and had several children. A former adherent of Menno Simons, the Anabaptist religious leader, Van Barrefelt became a follower of Hendrik Niclaes and joined the Family of Love. However, in 1573 Hendrik van Barrefelt had a vision and from this moment on he called himself \"Hi\u00ebl\" (the uniform life of God). Shortly after this vision he broke with Niclaes and began to write his own works.Alastair Hamilton, \"Hi\u00ebl and the Hi\u00eblists: The Doctrine and Followers of Hendrik Jansen van Barrefelt\", Quaerendo, 7 (1977), pp. 243-286. His followers called themselves Hi\u00eblists (lovers of the truth). Christophe Plantin, a well-known humanist, book printer and publisher in Antwerp and Leiden, also broke with Niclaes and became a follower and the central figure around Hi\u00ebl.", "The emphasis of Hi\u00ebl\u2019s works was on the search for Christ in the soul, an inward interpretation of the Scriptures and an opposition to the visible church. As a result they attracted people with a personal and conciliatory spirituality who had very little with the services and ceremonies of the established churches, but at the same time had no wish to change from one confession to another.Alastair Hamilton, \"Hi\u00ebl in England 1657-1810\", Quaerendo, XV, 4, 1985, pp. 285-286.", "Around 1580 Hi\u00ebl\u2019s writings began to appear and were printed in Antwerp and Leiden by Christophe Plantin.L\u00e9on Voet, The Plantin Press (1555-1589), Amsterdam 1980-1983, vol. I, pp. 255-264. Around 1582 Hi\u00ebl initiated two series of engravings for pictorial Bibles (Imagines et figurae Bibliorum), because he believed that the contemplation of biblical images would bring people closer to God. For this purpose he asked Pieter van der Borcht (1530-1608) to make two sets of illustrations of biblical stories for which Hi\u00ebl wrote the explanatory texts.Alastair Hamilton, \"From Familism to Pietism: the fortunes of Pieter van der Borcht\u2019s biblical illustrations and Hi\u00ebl\u2019s commentaries \u2026\", Quaerendo XI, 1981, pp. 271-301. The Latin version was published in 1582 by Jacobus Vilanus, a pseudonym of Christophe Plantin.J.A.L.Lanc\u00e9e, Biografisch Lexicon voor de geschiedenis van het Nederlands Protestantisme, deel 2, 1983, pp. 42-43.  After the death of Plantin other books by Hi\u00ebl were printed by Augustijn van Hasselt in Cologne. In 1687 Jacob Clausen published the complete works of Hi\u00ebl in a German translation which were very successful in Pietist circles.", "As from 1657 Hi\u00ebl\u2019s works began to appear in England. The first English translation called The Spiritual Journey of A Young Man towards the Land of Peace was printed in 1659 and sold by Giles Calvert, a prominent printer in London who specialized in spiritual literature.Alastair Hamilton, \"Hi\u00ebl in England 1657-1810\", Quaerendo, XV, 4, 1985, pp. 286-287. The German translation of Hi\u00ebl\u2019s works of 1687 was read by the Behmenist William Law and his circle of friends interested in mysticism. As a result of this Hi\u00ebl was to become considered as a precursor of Jakob B\u00f6hme. The great admiration which William Law had for Hi\u00ebl appears from the letter of Thomas Langcake to a friend, dated 30 November 1782, which said:", "Mr. Law said to me [of \u2026 Protestant Mystics] that Jacob Behmen was the first in Excellency, Hi\u00ebl the next, and in the third place the Quakers \u2026 tho' the deep mystic writers of the Romish Church surpassed them in their exceeding Love of God and Divine Wisdom.D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Hirst, Hidden Riches.
