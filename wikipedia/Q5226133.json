The tour spanned fourteen months, visiting twenty-seven countries and played to over two million people over 158 dates. The tour covered 100,000 miles and required 90 tonnes of equipment. The huge scale of the tour was to cover the sponsoring costs. Anton Corbijn designed the elaborate stage design, the first time he had ever done so. The huge scale of the tour took its toll on the band members. Despite Fletcher's comment that \"Dave was loving it [the tour]...he was on a different planet\", his heroin addiction had increased, Gore was drinking excessively and had several seizures, Fletcher was suffering from clinical depression to the point where he was replaced by Daryl Bamonte on all dates from April and the grueling nature of touring had taken its toll on Wilder. Gore later commented, \"I don't think anyone was ever the same after that tour\", highlighting the tense nature of the tour, and Q magazine would later refer to the Devotional Tour as \"the most debauched rock tour ever\".", "Also included was a 36-minute documentary on Songs of Faith and Devotion titled Depeche Mode: 1991\u201394 (We Were Going to Live Together, Record Together and It Was Going to Be Wonderful), named after a quote from Wilder on the potential of living in their Madrid-area recording studio. It features interviews with Depeche Mode (including Wilder, who would leave the band in 1995) and other important Depeche Mode-related figures like Daniel Miller, Anton Corbijn and Daryl Bamonte. There is also footage from the film Devotional and the music videos.
