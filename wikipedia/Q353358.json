Dixon was also capped 22 times for England. \nA childhood Manchester City fan, Dixon began his footballing career as a youth at Burnley, making his professional debut for them in 1982. From there he played for Chester City and Bury before joining Stoke City in 1986 for a fee of \u00a350,000. He instantly impressed at Stoke and forged a fine defensive partnership with Steve Bould. The pair's potential and performances attracted the attention of Arsenal and in January 1988 they both joined the \"Gunners\" for a combined fee of \u00a3765,000. The following season, as Dixon cemented his place in the team, Arsenal won their first league title in eighteen years in a dramatic final game of the season. A defensive mainstay in a successful Arsenal team until his retirement in 2002, Dixon's tenure at Arsenal saw him collect four league championship medals, three FA Cup winner's medals and a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup medal. He was named in the PFA Team of the Year twice, for the seasons 1989\u201390 and 1990\u201391. His retirement came at the end of Arsenal's domestic double-winning 2001\u201302 season, their second in his time at the club. At the time of his retirement, he had played at 91 out of the 92 Football League grounds \u2013 everyone except Fulham's Craven Cottage.\nSince his playing retirement, Dixon has worked as a football pundit and columnist.
