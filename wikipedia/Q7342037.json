Inspired to become an entrepreneur he took over the Walker ironworks on his father's death in 1845.  In 1850 at Washington, County Durham, Bell made a breakthrough discovering a new process for manufacturing lead oxychloride.  His partners and co-founders of the Washington chemical company, named after his home, were his brother-in-law Robert Benson Bowman and his father-in-law Hugh Lee Pattinson.  Pattinson was the inventor responsible for the process separating silver from lead that bears his name. Under an 1850 Indenture,Indenture 1759/13 Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, Pattinson and Bell declared themselves \"chemical manufacturers and co-partners in trade\". Bell decided the partnership might be incompatible with his continued involvement in the running of Losh, Wilson and Bell.  In September 1849 he wrote to Losh and Wilson informing them that the partnership with Pattinson \"would necessitate my relinquishing the office I at present hold in your firm\".", "In 1875, Bell began to move out of working in industry by retiring from his partnership with Robert Benson Bowman and Robert Stirling Newall, leaving the two of them to continue to run the chemical works until 1878, when Newall bought out Bowman.

In 1901, at age 85, after a long period of difficulty for heavy industry and with fears of worse to come as manufacturing grew in Germany, America and Japan, he made a decisive move to guard the family's wealth. He sold his railway interests to the North Eastern Railway company, and the sale of a majority holding in his manufacturing companies to rival Dorman Long was completed in 1903.  From the fortune thus released, he gave \u00a35,000 to each of his many nephews, nieces and grandchildren.", "On 20 July 1842 Bell, known as Lowthian, married Margaret Pattinson, daughter of his business partner Hugh Lee Pattinson and Phebe Walton.
