Although only  in length, the average traverse is likely to take 15\u201320 hours from sea level at Glenbrittle to the bar of the Sligachan Hotel owing to the difficulty of the terrain and route-finding problems. The first recorded traverse in under 24 hours was in 1911 by L. Shadbolt and A. McLaren. The record for the full traverse, set by Finlay Wild in October 2013, stands at 2 hours, 59 minutes and 22 seconds (though this time is from Gars-bheinn to Sg\u00f9rr nan Gillean and does not include the initial ascent from Glenbrittle or the final descent to Sligachan).Colin Wells, Running in Heaven . Sunday Herald (accessed 14 June 2007).
