The road was deemed to be \"too close to the sea\" by inspectors, and emergency funding totalling \u00a3281,000 was allocated to shore up the road and prevent damage. A license was granted by the Marine Management Organisation to install new rock armour coastal defences. Sue Hayman, the MP for the constituency of Workington in which the B5300 road is located, called for an urgent meeting with DEFRA officials, believing that any further delay in installing the new coastal defences could leave the road irreparably damaged. The closure had a serious effect on local businesses and charities. Several licenses were required in order for work to be able to begin, including a European Protected Species License. This license was eventually granted by Natural England on the basis that an ecologist would be on-site for the duration of the work. Protecting the Site of Special Scientific Interest and the local natterjack toad population was behind the delay, and the license was finally granted on the 17th of April 2019. Work commenced on the 23rd of April, with the road expected to re-open in July 2019. The road re-opened on the 20th of June 2019, after a section of rock armour 120m long was installed. The closed section of the road was also resurfaced. After the road was re-opened, local MP Sue Hayman called for \"urgent action\" over the future of the road. A meeting between Hayman and the government was delayed, in part due to that year's Conservative Party leadership election. Parts of the route of the B5300 are designated as being in managed retreat, further confusing the road's future."]}, {"page": "Birkby, Cumbria", "response": ["Birkby is in the parliamentary constituency of Workington.
