Arnison made Bradford's first goal for Peter Thorne, was booked and was substituted in the second half, as Bradford won 2\u20131. Arnison started the first seven games of the season before he was substituted against AFC Bournemouth because of an injury; it was later diagnosed as a muscle tear, which gave TJ Moncur the chance to deputise at right back.

Ainge came on during the victory but Halifax were later thrown out of the competition because loan players were not eligible. Ainge did not feature again for Halifax until 24 March 2008, when he came on as a substitute in the 16th minute when Halifax lost 2\u20130 to Droylsden.

He returned to Bradford in time to play in their final game of the season with Wycombe Wanderers as a late substitute. Ainge made his first start for City in more than a year as replacement for injured full backs Paul Arnison and TJ Moncur in a 1\u20131 draw with Luton Town on 4 October 2008. It was Ainge's only game for Bradford during the 2008\u201309 season, and instead he joined Cambridge United of the Conference on another loan deal on the March transfer deadline day for the final two months of the season.
