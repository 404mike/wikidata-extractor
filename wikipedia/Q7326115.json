To recapture this influence, Richard Gunnell attempted to start a children's company with 14\u00a0boys and several adults when he built the Salisbury Court Theatre in 1629. The enterprise was not a success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to plague soon after its inception; but it did produce Stephen Hammerton, who went on to act with the King's Men, and became an early matinee idol among young women in the audience for his romantic leads."]}, {"page": "Salisbury Court Theatre", "response": ["The Salisbury Court was built at a cost of \u00a31,000 by Richard Gunnell, a veteran actor and the manager of the Fortune, and William Blagrave, deputy to Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels.

In his youth he was apprenticed to a London merchant tailor, William Waverly, of the Strand. At the time, veteran actors Richard Gunnell and William Blagrave, founders of the Salisbury Court Theatre, were struggling to form a new company of child actors, similar to the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's of thirty years before.Peter Thomson et al., eds., The Cambridge History of British Theatre, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; Vol. 1, p. 149. Those troupes, famous in their own time, had been highly effective at training young actors and funnelling them into the adult companies that needed their talent; but the troupes of boy players had been defunct for nearly fifteen years when Blagrave and Gunnell started their Children of the Revels troupe in 1629. The relevant documents indicate clearly that part of the project's rationale was the training of young actors for the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre."]}, {"page": "Andrew Cane", "response": ["In 1654 Cane became involved in a lawsuit with actor William Wintershall and his wife, over a thirty-year-old debt of \u00a340.

During the theatre closure, 1642\u201360, Wintershall was one of the English actors who performed in Europe, mainly in The Hague and Paris, in the middle 1640s.Judith Milhous and Robert D.

The suit involved a thirty-year-old debt of \u00a340, between Richard Gunnell, builder of the Salisbury Court Theatre, and his actors, including Cane; Wintershall had married Gunnell's daughter Margaret in 1641 or 1642, so becoming involved in the dispute. (The outcome of the suit is not known).Leslie Hotson, The Commonwealth and Restoration Stage, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1928; pp. 52-3.
