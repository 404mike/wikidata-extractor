The first, at South Mimms, was opened by Margaret Thatcher in June 1987, a week before the election. Thatcher admired the practical and no-frills architecture of Charles Forte and praised him in her opening speech. The second, Clacket Lane, was opened by Robert Key, Minister for Roads and Traffic, on 21 July 1993.  Construction was delayed as the remains of a Roman villa were found on the site, requiring archaeological research. The other service area between junctions is Cobham, which opened on 13 September 2012."]}, {"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["In a May 1990 article Heseltine had proposed that the Poll Tax be reformed rather than abolished.Crick 1997, p. 366. He now had a remit to reform it, and invited the opposition parties to take part in his review of options (Labour did not; the Lib Dems did, and proposed a local income tax). Heseltine insisted that Michael Portillo, who had been a major cheerleader for the tax, be retained as Minister of State for Local Government. Portillo and Robert Key handled the detail and presented Heseltine with a list of options. Various options were leaked to the press to test public reaction, and at one point Heseltine appeared to have settled on a tax graded both according to the size of the property and the number of adults living in it. Major was exasperated by the lack of progress and intervened, and \u2013 at Major's insistence \u2013 Chancellor Norman Lamont increased VAT by 2.5 percentage points to 17.5% in his April 1991 budget so as to provide a \u00a34.5bn subsidy to bring poll tax bills down. Eventually, as expected, the poll tax was abolished and the new Council Tax was graded according to the size of a property, with the only concession to headcount being a single-person discount. In Crick's view, the outcome was much more Sarah Hogg's and Portillo's and Major's doing than Heseltine's."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Robert Key", "| Robert Key"]}, {"page": "Harrow School", "response": ["* Robert Key (born 1945): Politician; taught economics here 1969-1983"]}, {"page": "Scottish National Liberation Army", "response": ["In 1983 letter bombs were sent to Diana, Princess of Wales, and to the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.
