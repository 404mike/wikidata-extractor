Two away victories saw the club rise to fourth in the league, including a 1\u20130 win at Rushden in which Fred Belfield was \"advised to leave the field\" by the referee as the home crowd were threatening to rush the pitch in response to Belfield's repeated kicking of defender Minney. More crowd trouble also occurred in the 1\u20130 win at Doncaster Rovers, as Dick Evans was grabbed by the throat and Teddy Morse was \"hurled under the waggonette\". Morse was sent off in the following game, a 1\u20130 home defeat by Ilkeston Town, after Willett claimed he had bitten his nose. Vale went on to win their final two home fixtures, ending the campaign in seventh-place with 31 points from 28 matches, just one point away from third-place. Dick Evans finished as the club's top-scorer, claiming 12 league goals \u2013 though some of these might actually have been scored by namesake Ted Evans.
