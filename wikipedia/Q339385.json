He was associated with the Open University for seventeen years and was a Professor of Mathematics at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh from 1986 until his retirement in 1994. He holds the title of Professor Emeritus at Heriot-Watt, and remains active in research there. His areas of interest include statistical mechanics, phase transitions in metals and the physical chemistry of surfactants. His concept of off-diagonal long-range order is central to the present understanding of superfluids and superconductors. Other more abstract topics in which he has worked include understanding the physical basis for the direction of time and interpretations of quantum mechanics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roger Penrose", "response": ["Born in Colchester, Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of Margaret (Leathes) and psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose.
