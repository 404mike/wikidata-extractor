He died about 1335.\nSir John Peche was the son and heir of Richard Peche and Hawisia de Arden, and a great-grandson of Robert Peche. He was in the king's service in Scotland almost continuously from January 1297/8 till 1304. He served in various capacities in County Warwick from 1317 to 1321. He was summoned to Parliament from 15 May 1321 to 22 January 1335/6, by writs directed Johanni Pecche, whereby he is said to have become Lord Pecche. He was appointed keeper of the town and castle of Warwick, in 1321, and later was ordered to raise forces in County Warwick and lend them to the king. He kept the castle until July 1326. He fought at the Battle of Boroughbridge 16 March 1321/2, as a banneret, on the king's side.

Henry Knighton, in his Chronicle, identifies the principal Lollard Knights as Thomas Latimer, John Trussell, Lewis Clifford, Sir John Peche (son of John Peche of Wormleighton), Richard Storey, and Reginald Hilton. Thomas Walsingham's Chronicle adds William Nevil and John Clanvowe to the list, and other potential members of this circle have been identified by their wills, which contain Lollard-inspired language about how their bodies are to be plainly buried and permitted to return to the soil whence they came. There is little indication that the Lollard Knights were specifically known as such during their lifetimes; they were men of discretion, and unlike Sir John Oldcastle years later, rarely gave any hint of open rebellion. However, they displayed a remarkable ability to retain important positions without falling victim to the various prosecutions of Wycliffe's followers occurring during their lifetimes."]}, {"page": "Wormleighton", "response": ["* John Peche"]}, {"page": "Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports", "response": ["*Sir John Peche 1323"]}, {"page": "Peche", "response": ["* John Peche, a Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1323 to 1325"]}, {"page": "Peche, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Peche"]}]}}
