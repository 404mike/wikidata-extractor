She felt \"that they were doing the right and only thing\" and thought that she herself \"had always been a suffragist.\" By the following year Barrett was active as a WSPU activist and helped organise Adela Pankhurst's meetings in Cardiff and Barry that year, sharing the stage with her as one of the speakers. Barrett spoke on behalf of the WSPU at many meetings, often in Welsh, which conflicted with her role as a schoolteacher as her headmistress disapproved of the publicity, especially after news of Barrett being flour-bombed with Adela Pankhurst  at a rally in Cardiff Docks made the local papers. In July 1907 Barrett resigned as a teacher and enrolled at the London School of Economics, near the WSPU headquarters at Clement's Inn, intending to study economics and sociology and to work towards her DSc. That August she was heavily active for the WSPU, campaigning at the Bury St Edmunds by-election with Gladice Keevil, Nellie Martel, Emmeline Pankhurst, Aeta Lamb and Elsa Gye. She influenced the American student Alice Paul, and both sold copies of Votes for Women. Barrett was also active with Adela Pankhurst at Bradford. With her campaign activities over Barrett was free to attend the LSE, which proved useful for attending WSPU activities in nearby Clement's Inn. Over the Christmas period Barrett was again busy campaigning for the WSPU, with Pankhurst, Martel, Lamb, and Nellie Crocker at the \"rough and boisterous\" staunchly Liberal Mid-Devon seat at Newton Abbott, and next time in the lead up to the Ashburton by-election."]}, {"page": "1907 Bury St Edmunds by-election", "response": ["The by-election was a strong campaigning ground for the suffragette movement and the Women's Social and Political Union made it a target for propaganda sending high level members, including Gladice Keevil, Nellie Martel, Emmeline Pankhurst, Aeta Lamb, Rachel Barrett and Elsa Gye."]}, {"page": "Mary Phillips (suffragette)", "response": ["Her next WSPU campaign was in the West of England organising visit plans with Annie Kenney, Elsie Howey, Gladice Keevil, Clara Codd and later was on the platform, speaking in Plymouth in November 1908 with Annie Kenney and Mary Blathwayt."]}, {"page": "Eagle House (suffragette's rest)", "response": ["* Gladice Keevil (1884-1959) planted the blue spruce species (Picea pungens 'Kosteriana') on 4 November 1910."]}, {"page": "Laura Ainsworth", "response": ["Ainsworth was drafted to co-ordinate WSPU activities in the Midlands with Gladice Keevil.
