The piece, entitled \"Step Onto The Ground, Dear Brother\" (in Estonian, \"Tule Maale, Armas Veli\") draws on Estonian folklore and ancient Finno-Ugric texts, and was performed at the Roundhouse and at the Sage Gateshead as a co-headline with Imogen Heap and the Holst Singers. The performance was live streamed by The Guardian. The piece was divided into four parts: 'Mystery', 'War', 'Death' and 'Love' with electronic soundscapes created by composer Max de Wardener. She also duetted with Imogen Heap on her song, Hide and Seek, and Heap duetted on a song of Silvera's, entitled 'Letter from New York'. Critic Igor Toronyi-Lalic of The Arts Desk described the piece (alongside Oracles) as \"two stunning folkloric sages\" and wrote \"Silvera's voice, which has a Bj\u00f6rk-like spontaneity - an ability to be gritty and fragile one minute, warm, rich and ripe the next - bounced beautifully off the chamber ensemble (cello, violin, piano and percussion) and the glassy choir\"."]}, {"page": "Mara Carlyle", "response": ["December 2008 saw the release of Classist, a collaboration with composer Max de Wardener under the name \"Max de Mara\".
