They continued in this vein until Weller discovered the Who's debut album My Generation and became fascinated with Mod music and lifestyle. As he said later, \"I saw that through becoming a Mod it would give me a base and an angle to write from, and this we eventually did. We went out and bought suits and started playing Motown, Stax and Atlantic covers. I bought a Rickenbacker guitar, a Lambretta GP 150 and tried to style my hair like Steve Marriott's circa '66.\" Eventually Brookes left the band, but although they advertised for a new guitarist (Gary Webb later known as Gary Numan claims to have failed an auditionGary Numan (R)evolution: The Autobiography, Constable 2020, Chapter Three) he was not replaced.
