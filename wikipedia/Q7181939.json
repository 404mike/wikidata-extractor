He won his only cap for Wales in 1931. He started and ended his career at Port Vale, and also had spells with Everton, West Bromwich Albion, Cardiff City, and Folkestone Town. He played in the Southern League and in every division of the Football League, winning the Third Division North title with Port Vale in 1929\u201330, and winning the First Division title with Everton in 1931\u201332.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip Griffiths", "response": ["*Phil Griffiths (footballer) (1905\u20131978), Welsh international footballer", "*Phil Griffiths (cyclist) (born 1949), former English racing cyclist"]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["In 1929\u201330, only the two champions of the Third Divisions (North and South) would be promoted. The sale of Kirkham allowed for the strengthening of the team in other areas, though their talisman would still be missed. On 29 September 1929, manager Joe Schofield died, with Vale top of the league. Reserve team coach Tom Morgan was put in charge of first team affairs. The club's terrific form continued, and they finished the season as champions on 67 points. Their total of 37 goals conceded was the strongest defensive record in all four divisions. The 1930\u201331 was one of the strongest in the club's history. A fifth-place finish in the second tier was achieved mostly thanks to a solid defence. At the end of the season the club profited from a mini-tour of the Netherlands, where they recorded two victories over the Dutch Southern XI and a team of international reserves. However a loss of \u00a3800 was made on the season. Top-scorer for two seasons running, Sam Jennings was transferred to Stockport County; age was quickly catching up with the veteran striker. Jennings was one of many moved on or sold; Phil Griffiths was also moved on, sold to Everton for \u00a36,000. The new team fared poorly and were skirting the bottom of the division by Christmas time. A major boost came therefore, with the re-signing of Wilf Kirkham from Stoke City in January. They finished the season in 20th position, escaping relegation only on goal average."]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Phil Griffiths", "| August 1926 || MF ||  || Phil Griffiths || Wattstown || Free transfer ||"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Phil Griffiths", "|\u2013||MF|| Wales||Phil Griffiths||1||0||1"]}, {"page": "1928\u201329 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Phil Griffiths", "|\u2013||MF|| Wales||Phil Griffiths||2||0||2"]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Phil Griffiths", "|4||MF|| Wales||Phil Griffiths||14||0||0||14"]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["They finished fifth with 47 points, making it the most successful season in the club's history in terms of league position.
