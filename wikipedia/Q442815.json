He joined Oldham Athletic shortly afterwards, where he spent a successful season before being bought by Sheffield United just under 12 months later.\nAfter a three-year period in Yorkshire interrupted by suspensions, he was released and had a spell without a club before Everton signed him again in 2017 to rebuild his career in their reserve squad. He returned to Oldham in the summer of 2018. In July 2019, he signed for Plymouth Argyle, and left them in November 2019.Baxter represented England at both under-16 and under-17 level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bootle", "response": ["Many notable footballers were born in Bootle.

Done went on to score two goals in two matches between 10 September 2016 and 17 September 2016 against Wimbledon and Peterborough United. As a result, it was reported by The Star that Done was among few players to be offered a new contract by Wilder. However, as the 2016\u201317 season, Done's first team opportunities soon became limited, due to his lack of his goal-scoring form, as well as, Wilder preference of striker Billy Sharp. As a result, Done was placed on the substitute bench for the rest of the season. It wasn't until on 14 April 2017 when he scored his third goal of the season, in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, which saw Sheffield United promoted to Championship after six seasons in League One, Done went on to make thirty-five appearances and scoring three times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Jose BaxterMarc McNulty"]}, {"page": "Conor Sammon", "response": ["On 25 July 2015, Sammon joined League One club Sheffield United on loan for the whole season.
