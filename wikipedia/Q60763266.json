Born in St. Luke's, East London, he travelled throughout Europe as a circus performer before settling down in Malta at the age of nineteen. Within a few years he had opened a studio in Valletta, and he became a renowned photographer. His archive of tens of thousands of photographs still exists, and his work is significant for both its historic value and technical quality. His work is now in the public domain according to the law of Malta.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Ellis", "response": ["Richard Ellis may refer to:", "* Richard Ellis (astronomer) (born 1950), Caltech professor and former director of Palomar Observatory", "* Richard Ellis (biologist) (born 1938), American marine biologist, author, and illustrator ", "* Richard Ellis (librarian) (1865\u20131928), Welsh librarian and scholar", "* Richard Ellis (paediatrician) (1902\u20131966), British paediatrician", "*Richard Ellis (Texas politician) (1781\u20131846), Texas legislator", "*Richard Ellis (MP), in 1417 and 1421, MP for Great Yarmouth", "*Richard Ellis (Massachusetts politician), 17th century representative to the Great and General Court", "*Richard Ellis (Dedham), 19th century representative to the Great and General Court", "*Richard Ellis (English cricketer) (born 1960), former English cricketer", "*Richard Ellis (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1945), New Zealand cricketer", "*Richard Ellis (journalist), British former editor of the Sunday Telegraph", "*Richard Ellis (American photographer) (born 1960), news photographer and founder of the photo agency Newsmakers", "*Richard Ellis (Maltese photographer) (1842\u20131924), British-Maltese photographer", "*Richard Ellis International Limited, now part of CBRE Group, real estate company"]}, {"page": "Senglea", "response": ["File:Richard Ellis, Isla.png|Parish feast in Isla in the 1910s, by Richard Ellis"]}, {"page": "Cospicua", "response": ["File:Richard_Ellis,_Cannav\u00f2_barber_shop.jpg|Cannav\u00f2 barber shop on Cospicua's waterfront, 1910s, by Richard Ellis"]}, {"page": "Azure Window", "response": ["The earliest known record of the Azure Window is in an 1824 illustration of the nearby Dwejra Tower.

Richard Irton of a fully formed Azure Window probably dates to 1830. In 1866, artist Edward Lear visited Dwejra and stated in his journal that \"the coast scenery is not nearly as fine as that of Malta.\" The earliest recorded photographs of the natural arch were probably taken by Richard Ellis, and they are found in an album belonging to Michael Dundon dated 26 July 1879.
