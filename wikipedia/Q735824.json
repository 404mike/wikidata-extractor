Grace's presence initially attracted other leading players into the team, including C. B.

Influenced by the musical works of the 1980s and artists like Prince and Scritti Politti, Body Language musically differs from Minogue's previous albums, which mainly featured disco-oriented dance-pop tracks, and instead explores genres like synth-pop, electroclash, R&B, and hip hop. Lyrically, the album touches upon themes of enjoyment, flirting, and sex.", "Soon, Minogue began work on her ninth studio album Body Language. Aiming to create a dance-pop album inspired by electronic music from the 1980s, Minogue enlisted collaborators such as Cathy Dennis, Dan Carey, Emiliana Torrini, Johnny Douglas and Mantronix. Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced about her collaboration with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track \"Someday\", saying, \"To this day I haven't met him! I left a message on his answering machine, saying, \"Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!\" \"After Dark\" was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote \"Slow\", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying \"It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, \"Hey! You There!

On 12 September 1901, playing for the Rest of England against Yorkshire at Lord's, he scored 105, which was his sixth consecutive first-class century.The sequence was framed by scores in the 80s, so he nearly made it eight consecutive hundreds. For Sussex he scored 88 and 106 against Hampshire (scorecard), 209 against Yorkshire (scorecard), 149 against Middlesex (scorecard), 105 against Surrey (scorecard), 140 against Kent (scorecard), and then in his last innings of the season, for Rest of England, he scored 105 against the County Champions Yorkshire (scorecard). In his first innings of 1902, he scored 82 for London County against Surrey (scorecard). Donald Bradman equalled the record of six consecutive centuries in 1938\u201339, and Mike Procter did so again in 1970\u201371  He made his highest first-class score of 258 not out in 1911, a season which led to his recall to the England Test team as captain in 1912. In 1921 Fry was once again considered for the Test side. The Selection Committee asked him to play in the First Test match at Nottingham under the captaincy of Johnny Douglas, with a view to taking over the captaincy for the remainder of the series if, as they anticipated, things went wrong. Fry declined on the basis that there was no sense in recalling a forty-nine-year-old merely as a player, but stated that he would consider returning as captain. As England were badly beaten at Nottingham the Selection Committee again pressed Fry to return for the Second Test but once again he declined, due to poor form. Following another heavy defeat in the Second Test the Selection Committee made a further attempt to persuade Fry to return for the Third Test as captain, a job he was now keen to accept. He injured a finger taking a catch during Hampshire's match with the Australians. In the short term, the injury did not appear too serious: he scored a half-century in Hampshire's first innings and, when they followed on in reply to the Australians' massive total he top scored with 37. Furthermore, in his next match against Nottinghamshire he scored 61 in the first innings (but registered a duck in the second). It appears however that the injury was affecting his fielding more than his batting and, for last time, C.B. felt obliged to stand down from the side for the next Test. Fry later commentated on cricket matches, being called \"one of the most eloquent cricket commentators of all time.\""]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Johnny Douglas"]}, {"page": "Sydney Barnes", "response": ["Barnes joined the MCC tour of Australia in 1911\u201312 and played in all five Tests. In the first Test at Sydney, which England lost, captain Johnny Douglas shared the new ball with left-arm seamer Frank Foster.

At Melbourne, however, Douglas bowed to the pressure and surrendered the new ball to the Staffordshire bowler, who responded with a spell of four wickets for one run in his first five overs.
