He was promoted shortly after his return to England and commanded ships during the American War of Independence. In common with other officers, he struggled to find employment during the years of peace, but was given a ship to command for a few years in 1788. He was on bad terms with his lieutenant however, and a court-martial ensued. Taylor returned to an active career on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, still commanding small ships and escorting trade. Promoted to post captain in 1793, he moved to command several frigates in British waters, or as far afield as North America. His later service was on the African coast, where he took part in the capture of Gor\u00e9e in 1801, and in the Caribbean.\nHe does not appear to have held any seagoing commands during the Napoleonic Wars, but continued to be promoted, rising to flag rank in 1811. He eventually reached the rank of admiral of the red, before his death in 1842. He was by this time the last surviving officer from Cook's third voyage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Taylor", "response": ["William Taylor may refer to:", "*William Taylor (Royal Navy officer) (1760\u20131842), British naval officer", "*William Taylor (Alamo defender) (fl. 1836), fatality at the Battle of the Alamo", "*William Taylor (Medal of Honor) (1836\u20131902), Union Army soldier and officer during the American Civil War", "*William Taylor (Royal Navy officer, born 1908) (William Horace Taylor, 1908\u20131999), British recipient of the George Cross", "*William Taylor (New South Wales politician) (1862\u20131922), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "*William Taylor (Tasmanian politician) (1894\u20131964), member of the Tasmanian Parliament", "*William Taylor (Victorian politician) (1818\u20131903), pastoralist and member of the Victorian Legislative Council", "*William Taylor (New Brunswick politician) (died 1834), businessman and political figure in New Brunswick", "*William Taylor (MP for Windsor) (fl. 1640), Member of Parliament (MP) for Windsor", "*William Taylor (MP for Leominster) (fl. 1797), MP for Leominster", "*Sir William Taylor, 1st Baronet (1902\u20131972), British Conservative Member of Parliament", "*William Taylor (preacher) (fl. 2014\u20132017), Anglican minister elected to the Common Council of the City of London Corporation", "*William Taylor (New York politician) (1791\u20131865), U.S. Congressman from New York", "*William Taylor (Virginia politician, born 1788) (1788\u20131846), congressman and lawyer from Virginia", "*William Taylor (Lollard) (died 1423), English Priest and theologian, burnt as a Lollard", "*William Taylor (Scottish minister) (1744\u20131823), Scottish Minister, Moderator and Principal", "*William Taylor (bishop) (1821\u20131902), U.S. Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church", "*William Taylor (Archdeacon of Liverpool) (died 1906), Archdeacon in the Diocese of Liverpool", "*William Taylor (Dean of Portsmouth) (born 1956), Anglican priest", "*William Taylor (inventor) (1865\u20131937), British inventor", "*William Taylor (ophthalmologist) (1912\u20131989), British ophthalmologist and expert on albinism", "*Bob Taylor (cricketer) (born 1941), Robert William Taylor, English cricketer", "*William Taylor (Derbyshire cricketer) (1885\u20131976), English cricketer", "*William Taylor (Worcestershire cricketer) (1885\u20131959), English cricketer", "*William Taylor (Surrey cricketer) (1821\u20131878), English cricketer", "*William Taylor (footballer, born 1886) (1886\u20131966), English footballer", "*William Taylor (jockey, born 1819), rode in 1846 Grand National", "*William Taylor (jockey, died 1950), rode in 1898 Grand National", "*William Taylor (cyclist) (1900\u2013?), Canadian Olympic cyclist", "*William Taylor (bookseller) (fl. 1708\u20131724), bookseller trading at St. Paul's Churchyard, London, and publisher of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe in 1719", "*William Taylor (historian) (1922\u20132014), U.S. historian, professor, and author", "*William Taylor (man of letters) (1765\u20131836), English scholar and linguist", "*William Taylor (writer) (1938\u20132015), New Zealand children's writer", "*William Taylor (lawyer) (fl. 1971\u20132005), British lawyer who was lead counsel for Abdelbaset al-Megrahi at the Lockerbie trial", "*William Taylor (police officer) (born 1947), British police officer", "*William Taylor (judge) (born 1944), English senior Circuit Judge", "*William Taylor (headmaster) (1840\u20131910), British teacher, headmaster of Sir Walter St John's Grammar School For Boys", "*William Taylor, video game designer, see Blazing Angels 2", "*William Taylor (folk song), a British folk song", "*William Taylor (cotton manufacturer) (died 1852), cotton manufacturer in Lancashire, England", "*William Taylor (academic) (1930\u20132005), English educationalist, vice-chancellor of the University of Hull", "*William Taylor (Master of Christ's College, Cambridge), academic", "*William Taylor House (disambiguation)", "*William Taylor (Nights: Journey of Dreams), character from video game Nights: Journey of Dreams"]}, {"page": "HMS Magnanime (1780)", "response": ["Magnanime passed under the command of Captain William Taylor in spring 1799, and commanded her on African coast.

Arriving there just before the declaration of the Crimean War, he proved tactful, courteous but indecisive and difficult in his dealings with working with his French colleague Auguste Febvrier Despointes. The French and British fleets slowly advanced across the Pacific, spending a long time at the Marquesas Islands and Honolulu (where the English and French squadrons met in July 1854 and worked to reduce American influence). On 25 July 1854 the combined force sailed to meet two Russian frigates reported to be in the area, finding them dismantled at Petropavlovsk.
