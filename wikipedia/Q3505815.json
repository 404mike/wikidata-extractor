Nossek and friend Peter Coxhead set up a rival organization and on Friday, 13 April 1945 The Theatre Club was opened. The first production was of Sutton Vane's Outward Bound. It was well received, as were other plays, revues, concerts and musical evenings. There was a sufficient air of success to ensure that a number of these early members opted to continue working together when the war ended and they were demobbed and returned to England. There Nossek and Coxhead founded in the North London suburb of Crouch End the Mountview Theatre Club, an amateur repertory company, whose theatre opened officially in November 1947 with a production of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. This was followed by a regular play each month until 1949, after which Coxhead bought the building outright from the leaseholders. Thereafter, for the next 25 years one new production after another was staged every two to three weeks. The club was later to become very successful as the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, now located in custom-built premises in the South London suburb of Peckham.
