Punk and new wave bands tended to prefer second-hand combo organs from the 1960s, or use no keyboards at all. Other groups started taking advantage of cheaper and more portable synthesizers that were beginning to become available. The Stranglers' Dave Greenfield was an exception to this, and used a Hammond onstage during the band's early career. Andy Thompson, better known for being an aficionado of the Mellotron, stated, \"the Hammond never really went away. There are a lot of studios that have had a B-3 or C-3 sitting away in there since the 70s.\" The instrument underwent a brief renaissance in the 1980s with the mod revival movement. Taylor played the Hammond through the 1980s, first with the Prisoners and later with the James Taylor Quartet. In the 1990s, Rob Collins' Hammond playing was integral to the Prisoners-influenced sound of the Charlatans. The sound of the Hammond has appeared in hip-hop music, albeit mostly via samples. A significant use is the Beastie Boys' 1992 single \"So What'cha Want\", which features a Hammond mixed into the foreground (the instrument was recorded live rather than being sampled)."]}, {"page": "March 29", "response": ["*  1949   \u2013 Dave Greenfield, English musician (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "The Stranglers", "response": ["The Stranglers' early sound was driven by Jean-Jacques Burnel's melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Dave Greenfield's keyboards.
