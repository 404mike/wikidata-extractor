He initially served in the Royal Naval Air Service during the First World War, where he became known as one of \"the Zeppelin killers from Canada\", after shooting down two airships. During the inter-war period he served as a Royal Air Force squadron and station commander, eventually becoming the RAF's Director of Training in 1935, and was Air Officer Commanding RAF Mediterranean from 1938 until after the beginning of the Second World War.

The trans-Canada expedition was an epic venture, lasting 11 days and requiring six aircraft. The third leg was flown non-stop from the Canadian capital, Ottawa, to Sault Ste.

Over the Canadian Pacific Railway station he dropped a signal to be telegraphed to the Air Board in Ottawa, \"Making a good 50 miles per hour\", then with a wave to lunchtime onlookers, the pilots swung their F.3 out over nearby Lake Nipissing, onwards to Sault Ste.
