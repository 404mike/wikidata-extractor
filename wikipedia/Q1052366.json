His father was a police constable. He was educated at Everton Elementary School, Model Boys' School, and Belfast Methodist College. He worked for the Belfast timber trader James P. Corry after leaving school in 1941 until he was elected to Parliament in 1983. He married Ann Verrant in 1953. They had two sons.He became actively involved in Unionist politics in the 1970s, was an unsuccessful pro-White Paper Unionist candidate at the election to the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly and was elected to Belfast City Council in 1977.  He contested the Belfast North constituency in the 1979 general election, narrowly losing to John McQuade of the Democratic Unionist Party.  He won the seat 4 years later, in the 1983 general election, after McQuade retired. He was one of the MPs with the lowest attendance rate at Westminster.Along with all other Unionist MPs, he resigned his seat in December 1985 in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  He was re-elected at a by-election in January 1986. In 1988, he advocated internment of Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) suspects to stem a series of murders, but also argued for the internment of suspects connected with the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force. In the early 90s, an IRA plot to assassinate Walker by attaching a magnetic bomb to the roof of his armoured car was foiled after the IRA learned that police were aware of the plan. In 1998, he was one of only two UUP MPs to support the Good Friday Agreement without reservation, and he backed UUP leader David Trimble until the end of Trimble's own political career in 2005.However, he lost his own seat to Nigel Dodds of the DUP in the 2001 general election, following a disastrous televised debate at Crumlin Road Courthouse in his constituency, in which he stumbled over some of the most rudimentary questions.  His vote declined from 21,000 to 4,000, his 13,000 majority was transformed into a 6,000 majority for the DUP and he was beaten into fourth place behind Sinn F\u00e9in and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) - although this was also partly because there had been no DUP candidate in the previous general election.He was noted for the moderation of his Unionist views, which contrasted with the deep sectarian divisions in his constituency.  He said he would have no objection to amending the Act of Settlement 1701 to allow the heir to the throne to marry a Roman Catholic, and caused controversy in 2001 by saying that a united Ireland in 30 years time may not be a bad thing, though he later said that was a \"throwaway line that has been taken out of context\".  He was created a Knight Bachelor in the Queen's Birthday Honours in June 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Cecil Walker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Cecil Walker"]}, {"page": "Walker (surname)", "response": ["*Cecil Walker (1924\u20132007), Northern Irish politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Cecil Walker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Cecil Walker"]}, {"page": "Nigel Dodds", "response": ["North Belfast had historically been strong territory for the DUP, with Johnny McQuade representing the constituency in the British House of Commons from 1979 to 1983.
