Some reflections on the phenomenological method. Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences, 7(2):50\u201362. \"When an external object is perceived, consciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its own object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself.\" However his critique of psychoanalysis, particularly of Freud has faced some counter-critique. Richard Wollheim and Thomas Baldwin argued that Sartre's attempt to show that Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud.Wollheim, Richard. Freud.

Other philosophers have critiqued the lecture on various grounds: Martin Heidegger wrote in a letter to the philosopher and Germanist Jean Beaufret that while Sartre's statement that \"existence precedes essence\" reverses the metaphysical statement that essence precedes existence, \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement.\" In Heidegger's view, Sartre \"stays with metaphysics in oblivion of the truth of Being.\". Heidegger reportedly told Hubert Dreyfus that Sartre's work was \"dreck.\" Marjorie Grene found Sartre's discussion of \"the problem of the relation between individuals\" in Existentialism and Humanism to be weaker than the one he had previously offered in Being and Nothingness (1943). Walter Kaufmann commented that the lecture \"has been widely mistaken for the definitive statement of existentialism,\" but is rather \"a brilliant lecture which bears the stamp of the moment.\" According to Kaufmann, Sartre makes factual errors, including misidentifying philosopher Karl Jaspers as a Catholic, and presenting a definition of existentialism that is open to question. Thomas C. Anderson criticized Sartre for asserting without explanation that if a person seeks freedom from false, external authorities, then he or she must invariably allow this freedom for others. Iris Murdoch found one of Sartre's discussions with a Marxist interesting, but otherwise considered Existentialism and Humanism to be \"a rather bad little book.\" Mary Warnock believed Sartre was right to dismiss the work."]}, {"page": "Being and Nothingness", "response": ["The philosopher David Pears criticized Sartre's critique of Freud, describing it as complex but imprecisely formulated and open to potential objections. The philosopher Thomas Baldwin described Being and Nothingness as a work of pessimism. He wrote that Sartre's argument that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of Freud, and that Sartre's attempts to adapt Freud's ideas are of greater interest. The director Richard Eyre recalled that Being and Nothingness was popular among British students in the 1960s, but suggests that among them the work usually went unread."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (R\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)"]}, {"page": "The Bounds of Sense", "response": ["More critical views include those of philosophers such as Thomas Baldwin, Frederick C. Beiser, and E. J. Lowe. Beiser writes that while Strawson is the most notable commentator to have argued that the central arguments of Kant's Analytic can be separated from Kant's transcendental psychology and transcendental idealism, his interpretation of the Deduction leaves unresolved questions. He notes that Kant himself rejected a reading of the kind proposed by Strawson. Lowe writes that while The Bounds of Sense is widely admired, Strawson is \"seen by some as being unduly dismissive of Kant's doctrine of transcendental idealism\" and over-optimistic in his \"suggestion that many of the central arguments of Kant's critical philosophy can survive\" its repudiation. Baldwin writes that Strawson's critics have argued that Strawson's attempt to separate Kant's conclusions \"concerning the presuppositions of objective experience and judgment\" from his transcendental idealism leads to an unstable position. In their view, transcendental arguments \"can tell us only what we must suppose to be the case\", meaning that \"if Kant's idealism, which restricts such suppositions to things as they appear to us, is abandoned, we can draw conclusions concerning the way the world itself must be only if we add the verificationist thesis that ability to make sense of such suppositions requires ability to verify them.\""]}, {"page": "Repression (psychoanalysis)", "response": ["The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre challenged Freud's theory by maintaining that there is no \"mechanism\" that represses unwanted thoughts.

The philosopher Roger Scruton argued in Sexual Desire (1986) that Freud's theory of repression disproves the claim, made by Karl Popper and Ernest Nagel, that Freudian theory implies no testable observation and therefore does not have genuine predictive power, since the theory has \"strong empirical content\" and implies testable consequences."]}, {"page": "Metaphysical nihilism", "response": ["To understand metaphysical nihilism, one can look to the subtraction theory in its simplest form, proposed by Thomas Baldwin.
