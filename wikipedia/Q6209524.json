Convinced that Act 1 was by George Peele, Alexander felt he was not undermining the integrity of Shakespeare by drastically altering it; for example, Saturninus and Tamora are present throughout, they never leave the stage; there is no division between the upper and lower levels; all mention of Mutius is absent; and over 100 lines were removed.An overview of this production can be found in Hughes (2006: 51\u201353)"]}, {"page": "The Master (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The Master returns in \"The End of Time\" (2009\u20132010) when his disciples attempt a resurrection ritual using a surviving piece of The Master's body.

The Master proceeds with a plot to transform the entire human race into his own clones, and using their combined presence, triangulates the \"drumbeat\" in his head to its source: The Time Lord President Rassilon (Timothy Dalton). The Time Lord Chancellor (Joe Dixon) describes the drumming noise in The Master's head as something \"[h]istory says [is] a torment that stayed with him for the rest of his life.\" The Time Lords set up the signal back in time in The Master's head as a child as a means to escape the last days of the Time War. They attempt to return to the universe. Confronted with Rassilon, whose drumbeat is the cause of The Master's insanity, The Master teams up with The Doctor to destroy them.
