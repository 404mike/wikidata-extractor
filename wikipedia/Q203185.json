Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK. Its title-track, though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French. Towards the end of the year, Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show Marc, and again two days later for Bing Crosby's final CBS television Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in \"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\", a version of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" with a new, contrapuntal verse.

In 1972, Fripp changed the group's instrumentation and approach, drawing inspiration from European free improvisation, and developing ever more complex compositions. They reached what some saw as a creative peak on Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974), and Red (1974). Fripp disbanded this group in 1974.", "In August 1967, drummer Michael Giles and his bassist brother Peter, pro musicians in working bands since their mid-teens in Dorset, England, advertised for a \"singing organist\" to join a group they were forming.

Beat is the only album where Fripp had no involvement in the original mixing; Davies and Belew undertook production duties. The album had a linked theme of the Beat Generation and its writings, reflected in song titles such as \"Neal and Jack and Me\" (inspired by Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac), \"Heartbeat\" (inspired by Carolyn Cassady's \"Heart Beat: My Life with Jack and Neal\"), \"The Howler\" (inspired by Allen Ginsberg's \"Howl\") and \"Waiting Man\" (inspired by William Burroughs). Fripp asked Belew to read Kerouac's novel On the Road for inspiration, and the album contained themes of life on the road, existential angst and romanticism. While Beat was more accessible, it had the improvised \"Requiem\", which featured Frippertronics, a guitar technique invented by Brian Eno and Robert Fripp using a tape loop system.", "On 2 June 2017, King Crimson released a new live EP named \"Heroes\" (after the David Bowie song), as a tribute to both the artist and the album featuring the song in question, both of which featured distinctive Robert Fripp guitar contributions throughout. The video to the song won \"Video of the Year\" at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards. Shortly afterwards, King Crimson embarked on a United States tour beginning on 11 June and ending on 26 November. On 3 September, Robert Fripp said that his differences with Adrian Belew had been resolved and that there were \"no current plans for (him) to come out with the current formation\" but \"the doors to the future are open.\" Belew confirmed this, adding \"it means I may be back in the band in the future at some point.\" On 13 October, it was announced that Bill Rieflin would be unable to join the Three Over Five Formation on the 2017 Autumn tour in the U.S. He was temporarily replaced by Seattle-based Crafty Guitarist Chris Gibson.

Rieflin's parts were divided among other band members, with Fripp, Stacey, Jakszyk and Collins adding keyboards to their on-stage rigs, and Levin once again using the synthesizer he used during the '80s tours.

Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album Red had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album In Utero. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta, Primus, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practised together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of In the Court of the Crimson King entitled Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn. Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply. The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s. Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords. Bad Religion cites the lyrics of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on their single \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" and the name of their record label, Epitaph (founded by their guitarist Brett Gurewitz), comes from the song of the same name on Crimson's debut album.

In early 1970 Ferry had auditioned as lead singer for King Crimson, who were seeking a replacement for Greg Lake.

It was originally broadcast on the now-defunct Nederlandse Programma Stichting. In 1997, Keenan explained how the composition process of Tool reflected that of King Crimson: \"They're very much into listening to each other; even though they might have a basic structure that they're following, it's about fitting themselves in with each other.\" Contrary to these statements, longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating \"Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one.

When recording, Chapman would start with the bass track, which was difficult to record at the time, by way of \"pencil erasing\". Chapman explained in an interview for Sound on Sound, \"that meant using a pencil to hold the tape away from the head and erasing up to the kick drum.

Her next solo album Desire (1987) was less successful although the single with her version of \"Echo Beach\" made it Top 50.
