She is best known for her series of novels featuring the Scarlet Pimpernel, the alter ego of Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English fop who turns into a quick-thinking escape artist in order to save French aristocrats from \"Madame Guillotine\" during the French Revolution, establishing the \"hero with a secret identity\" in popular culture.Opening in London's West End on 5 January 1905, The Scarlet Pimpernel became a favourite of British audiences. Some of Orczy's paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. During World War I, she formed the Women of England's Active Service League, an unofficial organisation aimed at encouraging women to persuade men to volunteer for active service in the armed forces.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Scarlet Pimpernel", "response": ["Category:Novels by Baroness Emma Orczy", "Category:Plays by Baroness Emma Orczy"]}, {"page": "1911 in literature", "response": ["*Emma Orczy \u2013 The Duke's Wager"]}, {"page": "1905 in literature", "response": ["*January 5 \u2013 Baroness Emma Orczy's play The Scarlet Pimpernel, adapted by Julia Neilson and Fred Terry, who play the leads, makes its London debut at the New Theatre, followed shortly by publication of the novel."]}, {"page": "1906 in literature", "response": ["*Emma Orczy (Baroness Orczy) \u2013 The Sin of William Jackson"]}, {"page": "1908 in literature", "response": ["*Emma Orczy \u2013 Beau Brocade"]}, {"page": "1918 in literature", "response": ["*Emma Orczy (Baroness Orczy) \u2013 The Legion of Honour (adaptation of A Sheaf of Bluebells)"]}, {"page": "1947 in literature", "response": ["*November 12 \u2013 Baroness Orczy (Emma Orczy), Hungarian novelist writing in English (born 1865)"]}, {"page": "Swashbuckler", "response": ["The genre has, apart from swordplay, always been characterized by influences that can be traced back to the chivalry tales of Medieval Europe, such as the legends of Robin Hood and King Arthur. It soon created its own drafts based on classic examples like The Mark of Zorro (1920), The Three Musketeers (1921), Scaramouche (1923) and The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934). Some films did also use motifs of pirate stories. Often these films were adaptations of classic historic novels published by well-known authors such as Alexandre Dumas, Rafael Sabatini, Baroness Emma Orczy, Sir Walter Scott, Johnston McCulley, and Edmond Rostand."]}, {"page": "The Elusive Pimpernel (1950 film)", "response": ["Category:Films based on works by Emma Orczy"]}]}}
