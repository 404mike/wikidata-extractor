He applied innovative glazes and firing techniques. Galleons and fish were common motifs, as were \"fantastical\" birds and animals.

The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing \u00a33\u00a05s (about \u00a3 as of ) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.", "William De Morgan was unwilling to compromise on quality or embrace the trend towards mass production, and by this time his work was significantly more expensive than similar works by other designers. Consequently, his ceramics business was becoming increasingly unviable financially.

Nine further De Morgan tablets, installed in 1902, were made using standard tiles to reduce costs, and were the last tiles whose installation was overseen by Watts. Eleven further De\u00a0Morgan tablets, along with T. H. Wren's memorial to Watts, were added in 1905, completing the central row of tablets.
