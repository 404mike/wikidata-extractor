A lifelong friend of William Morris, he designed tiles, stained glass and furniture for Morris & Co. from 1863 to 1872. His tiles often recall medieval or Islamic design patterns. He applied innovative glazes and firing techniques. Galleons and fish were common motifs, as were \"fantastical\" birds and animals. Many of De Morgan's tiles were designed to create intricate patterns when several were laid together.", "link_mentions": {}}}
