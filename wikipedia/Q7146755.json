At first pleased with her job, she quickly became concerned about the SOE's actions, intentions and dubious security and finances, and considered that the organisation was working \"across, if not against, the war effort\". In March 1941, she expressed her concerns to the visiting Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and in May to General Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief for the Middle East. Wavell could take no direct action since SOE did not come under the War Office, but sharing her concerns, he asked her to pass on any documents that aroused her suspicion.  She achieved this by stealing questionable documents from the office each evening, typing a copy of them and then returning the originals to their positions the next morning. Her subterfuge led directly to a major reorganisation of SOE Cairo in the summer of 1941."]}, {"page": "Zara Hore-Ruthven, Countess of Gowrie", "response": ["The Gowries had two sons.
