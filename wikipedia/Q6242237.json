In 1910, the company was awarded a contract by the British Museum, which required them to unobtrusively fix electrical fittings to the museum walls.  The contract led to the invention and patenting of the world's first wall plug, which became a standard solution for attaching things to walls.  John Joseph Rawlings, who is credited with invention of the wall plug, named his product Rawlplug, using the first syllable of his last name, and renamed his business to Rawlplug in 1919.", "The company continued to sell its products worldwide and in 1998 became the first British producer to attain ETA certification. Since the death of John Joseph Rawlings, the business changed hands a few times until in 2005 it was bought by Koelner Group, a Wroclaw-based manufacturer."]}, {"page": "Wall plug", "response": ["The original wall plug was invented by John Joseph Rawlings in 1911, and marketed under the name Rawlplug. These plugs became popular after the First World War, when a demand for retro-fitting existing buildings with new electric lighting coincided with a shortage of labour, encouraging many new labour-saving innovations in the building trade. Rawlplug gained their prominence from their adoption in the British Museum."]}, {"page": "Rawlings (surname)", "response": ["*John Joseph Rawlings, British engineer and inventor"]}]}}
