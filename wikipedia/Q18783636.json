Pluto also appears in works based on other classical myths of the underworld. As a singing role, Pluto is almost always written for a bass voice, with the low vocal range representing the depths and weight of the underworld, as in Monteverdi and Rinuccini's L'Orfeo (1607) and Il ballo delle ingrate (1608). In their ballo, a form of ballet with vocal numbers, Cupid invokes Pluto from the underworld to lay claim to \"ungrateful\" women who were immune to love. Pluto's part is considered particularly virtuosic,Mark Ringer, Opera's First Master: The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi (Amadeus Press, 2006), pp. 34, 75, 103\u2013104; Tim Carter, Monteverdi's Musical Theatre (Yale University Press, 2002), p. 95; Enid Welsford, The Court Masque (Cambridge University Press, 1927), pp. 112\u2013113. and a reviewer at the premi\u00e8re described the character, who appeared as if from a blazing Inferno, as \"formidable and awesome in sight, with garments as given him by poets, but burdened with gold and jewels.\"Tim Carter, Monteverdi's Musical Theatre p. 81, quoting Follino, Compendio delle sontuose feste (1608), and p. 152."]}, {"page": "Rose Mary Crawshay Prize", "response": ["|Enid Welsford", "|Enid Welsford"]}]}}
