In 2003, the main British base covering the region was Camp Abu Naji, which was  south of Amarah and  north of Majar al-Kabir. Majar al-Kabir was well known as being awash with weapons as the area was predominantly Shia Muslim, whose people had been brutally treated by the government of Saddam Hussein. When the British arrived they found an area devoid of government officials as all the Ba'athists had been chased away by the local populace in retaliation for their treatment under Saddam's regime. The region was also prone to other influences such as the CIA operating in the area. This annoyed Lieutenant-Colonel Tom Beckett (commanding officer of 1 Para) who demanded that all CIA operatives clear their routines in the 1 Para area of operations through the Ops Room at Camp Abu Naji.", "On finding that the six RMP were dead, Lieutenant Colonel Tom Beckett, officer commanding 1 Para, ordered the withdrawal of troops from the town. This was vastly unpopular with the troops on the ground and earnt him several derogatory nicknames. Later, many troops realised that he was in a 'lose-lose' situation. If Beckett had allowed the soldiers to go back in again, there would have been many more deaths on both sides and as one soldier acknowledged, \"he would have ended up sacked if he'd let us [back] in there that day\". The decision not to go in and recover the bodies, but allowing the Iraqi doctor to deliver them to 1 Para, was commended by the Army Board of Inquiry as correct and prevented further losses on both sides. 1 Para were criticized for not going in and rescuing the RMP, but at the inquest, Lieutenant Kennedy stated that no-one on the ground in Majar al-Kabir was aware of their presence until they were informed of their location by Dr. Fasal and quite soon after he had returned to inform them of their [the RMP] deaths."]}, {"page": "Thomas Beckett", "response": ["* Tom Beckett (born 1962), British Army officer"]}, {"page": "2018 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Lieutenant General Tom Beckett, "]}, {"page": "General Beckett", "response": ["*Tom Beckett (born 1962), British Army lieutenant general"]}]}}
