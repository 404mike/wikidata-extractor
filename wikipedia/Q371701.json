This would only change with the establishment of the Republic and, even so, only slowly. Members included foreign ambassadors who felt it necessary to be close to the King when he was absent from Lisbon, as well as politicians such as Fontes Pereira de Melo, Henrique de Barros Gomes, Ant\u00f3nio de Serpa Pimentel, Jos\u00e9 Dias Ferreira and Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral. The military was represented by Hermenegildo Capelo and Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro, while writers included Camilo Castelo Branco and Edgar Prestage, Britain's leading authority on Portuguese history and literature. Among businessmen and bankers were Jorge O\u2019Neill. The photographer, Joshua Benoliel, was also a member. "]}]}}
