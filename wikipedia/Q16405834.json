On 1 November, in a speech in the Piazza del Duomo in Milan, Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini referred to the Italo-German relationship as an \"Axis\" for the first time: \"The Berlin encounters have resulted in an agreement between both countries on specific problems which are particularly acute these days. But this agreement ... this vertical axis Berlin\u2013Rome is not a diaphragm, but rather an axis with which all European states animated by the will to collaborate and to peace can collaborate.\" The protocol has been seen as \"a joint declaration of war on the status quo\", mainly represented by the opposition of Britain and France to German and Italian expansion.John Hiden, Germany and Europe, 1919\u20131939, 2nd ed.
