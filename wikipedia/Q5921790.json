In the words of Professor Peter Whittle (FRS),  \u2018The striking feature of Howell Tong\u2019s \u2026 is the\ncontinuing freshness, boldness and spirit of enquiry which inform them-indeed, proper qualities for\nan explorer. He stands as the recognised innovator and authority in his subject, while remaining\ndisarmingly direct and enthusiastic .\u2019\u00b9  And his work, in the words of Sir David Cox, \u2018links two fascinating fields, nonlinear time series and deterministic dynamical systems.\u2019\u00b2 \nHe is the father of the threshold time series models, which have extensive applications in ecology, economics, epidemiology and finance. Besides nonlinear time series analysis, he was the co-author of a seminal paper, which he read to the Royal Statistical Society, on dimension reduction in semi-parametric statistics by pioneering the approach based on minimum average variance estimation. He has also made numerous novel contributions to nonparametric statistics (obtaining the surprising result that cross-validation does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality for consistent estimation of the embedding dimension of a dynamical system),  Markov chain modelling (with application to weather data), reliability, non-stationary time series analysis (in both the frequency domain and the time domain) and wavelets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["*2007 Howell Tong (Silver)", "* Howell Tong, statistician"]}, {"page": "Guy Medal", "response": ["* 2007 Howell Tong"]}]}}
