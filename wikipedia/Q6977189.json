Like his two previous records, it was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and featured Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars \u2013 comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. Also in the lineup was American pianist Mike Garson, who was hired by Bowie at the suggestion of RCA executive Ken Glancey and singer-songwriter Annette Peacock. The pianist came from a jazz and blues background, which Pegg believes veered the album from pure rock 'n' roll and expanded Bowie's experimental horizons. Buckley called Aladdin Sane the beginning of Bowie's \"experimental phase\" and cited Garson's presence as \"revolutionary\". Scott noted that Garson added elements to the arrangements that were not there before, including more keyboards and synthesisers. Garson later said that Scott as producer \"got the best piano sound out of any of his performances for Bowie.\" Garson remembered being given a lot of attention from Bowie in the studio, who mainly wanted to see what Garson could do. He remained with Bowie's entourage for the next three years. Along with Garson, others added to the lineup for the album and tour included saxophonists Ken Fordham and Brian \"Bux\" Wilshaw and backing vocalists Juanita Franklin, Linda Lewis and longtime friend Geoffrey MacCormack (later known as Warren Peace); MacCormack would subsequently appear on numerous records by Bowie throughout the remainder of the 1970s."]}, {"page": "McCormack", "response": ["* Geoffrey MacCormack known as Warren Peace, English vocalist"]}, {"page": "Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)", "response": ["At just under seven minutes, \"Turn Blue\", the longest song on Lust for Life, was a sprawling confessional that dated back to an abortive recording session by Bowie and Pop in May 1975, when the latter was in the depths of his drug addiction. Originally titled \"Moving On\", it was composed by Bowie, Pop, Walter Lacey, and Warren Peace. It was the only set of lyrics that did not appear on the original vinyl record sleeve. The album's remaining tracks included \"Sixteen\", the only piece written entirely by Pop; \"Some Weird Sin\", a hard rock number featuring a \"lost-boy lyric\"; the \"neo-punk\" \"Neighborhood Threat\"; and \"Fall in Love with Me\", which grew from an impromptu jam by the band to which Pop composed lyrics apparently evoking Friedmann.", "* Warren Peace \u2013 keyboards and backing vocals (\"Turn Blue\")"]}, {"page": "Diamond Dogs", "response": ["Buckley writes the album was the first time Bowie used a recording studio as an instrument. With Scott's departure, Bowie produced the album himself. Keith Harwood, who had worked previously with the Rolling Stones on numerous sessions, and on Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, handled engineering duties. Pegg writes that despite Bowie and Harwood's previous collaborations on Mott the Hoople's All the Young Dudes and the original version of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" (both 1972), Diamond Dogs was Harwood's first credit on a Bowie album. Bowie described being \"in awe\" of Harwood because of his work with the Stones. With the departure of the Spiders from Mars, Bowie handled lead guitar duties. He recalled in 1997 that he practiced every day knowing \"the guitar playing had to be more than okay\". This surprised NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, producing what they described as a \"scratchy, raucous, semi-amateurish sound that gave the album much of its characteristic flavour\". Pianist Mike Garson and drummer Aynsley Dunbar returned from the Pin Ups sessions, Tony Newman also played drums while Herbie Flowers, who had played previously on Space Oddity (1969), was recruited to play bass. Alan Parker of Blue Mink played guest guitar on \"1984\" and \"augmented\" Bowie's riff on \"Rebel Rebel\", although he was only credited for \"1984\". Bowie's longtime friend Geoff MacCormack, now known as Warren Peace, sang backing vocals. Diamond Dogs was a milestone in Bowie's career as it reunited him with Tony Visconti, who provided string arrangements and helped mix the album at his studio in London. Visconti would go on to co-produce much of Bowie's work for the rest of the decade.", "Bowie and Geoff MacCormack (Warren Peace) co-wrote \"Rock 'n' Roll with Me\".

A power ballad, the song explores the relationship between the audience and an actor. When asked whether fans considered him a leader, Bowie described \"Rock 'n' Roll with Me\" as his response, saying: \"You're doing it to me, stop it!\" Buckley writes the song foreshadowed the soul direction that Bowie would take on Young Americans. The lyrics of \"We Are the Dead\" reflect the characters of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Winston and Julia's, love for each other. They establish a world fraught with danger that mirrors the rest of the album. Buckley describes the lyrics as \"gothic\" and the music as \"creepy\". Although it quotes Nineteen Eighty-Four directly, O'Leary and James Perone argue the song owes more to the writings of Burroughs.", "All tracks written by David Bowie, except \"Rock 'n' Roll with Me\", co-written by Warren Peace."]}, {"page": "Station to Station", "response": ["In terms of personnel, Bowie brought back producer Harry Maslin, who co-produced \"Fame\" and \"Across the Universe\" on Young Americans.

Also returning from the Young Americans sessions were guitarists Carlos Alomar and Earl Slick, drummer Dennis Davis and Bowie's old friend Geoff MacCormick (now known as Warren Peace). Bassist George Murray, a player from Weldon Irvine's group, was recruited to play bass. Bowie would use the lineup of Alomar, Murray and Davis for the rest of the decade. In mid-October, pianist Roy Bittan, a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, joined the ensemble at the suggestion of Slick. Bittan recalled: \"David knew we were coming to town and he wanted a keyboard player. It must have only been about three days.
