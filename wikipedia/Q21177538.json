In Parliament Griffith asked the Chief Secretary, William Wood various questions including \"whether it was a fact that a 'trainload' of police had been sent to Broken Hill\". He then moved for the matter to be discussed by the House as a matter of urgency, however this was rejected by the House. Later Griffith again sought to have the matter discussed by the House and the Speaker, William McCourt, ruled it out of order, without hearing argument. Griffith then said \"it was unfortunate to be in a minority, and that the Speaker did not give fair play to the Opposition.\" He was then \"named\" by the Speaker and on refusing to withdraw the remarks was found guilty of contempt of parliament and suspended until he withdrew the remark. Griffith chose to resign rather than withdraw the remarks."]}]}}
