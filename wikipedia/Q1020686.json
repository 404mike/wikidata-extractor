From 1945 to the early sixties, he was married to Princess Faiza, sister of King Farouk of Egypt.\nBulent Rauf dedicated many years of his life to teaching the Islamic concept of \"the one Absolute Unity of all existence\" (tawhid). Among other things, the British mystic and author Reshad Feild, who portrayed him as \"Hamid\" in his well-known book The Last Barrier, considered him to be his 'teacher'. However, Bulent Rauf himself emphasized the Islamic view that Muhammad was the final prophet, and that each person is taught directly by their own life with no intermediary. Rauf's chief literary work was the complete rendering into English of Ibn 'Arabi's Fus\u00fbs al-Hikam (The Bezels of Wisdom), incorporating the four volume Ottoman commentary attributed to Ismail Hakki Bursevi. \nBulent Rauf was instrumental in founding the Beshara School for Esoteric Education in Scotland in 1975, which has been attended by hundreds of students from all over the world.  He lived at Chisholme and Turkey from 1975 until his death and was a consultant to the school throughout that period.\nBulent Rauf was the first president of the Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi Society, which is dedicated to making known the work of the Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi, and encouraged translation and publication of his writings. Rauf led the society until his death in 1987.\nThe 2012 documentary In Search of Oil and Sand tells the story of Bulent Rauf's creation of the amateur movie Oil and Sand, together with members of the Egyptian royal family and their friends, in the weeks leading up to the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sufism", "response": ["Other noteworthy Sufi teachers who have been active in the West in recent years include Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Inayat Khan, Nazim Al-Haqqani, Muhammad Alauddin Siddiqui, Javad Nurbakhsh, Bulent Rauf, Irina Tweedie, Idries Shah, Muzaffer Ozak, Nahid Angha, and Ali Kianfar."]}, {"page": "Reshad Feild", "response": ["Feild was influenced by the spiritual teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, and others. He studied spiritual healing, and was involved with the Alice Bailey community. In the late 1960s, he was initiated as a sheikh in the Sufi Order International by Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan. Feild studied with Bulent Rauf, a Turkish author and translator descended from a line of Sufi masters going back to the Andalusian mystic Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi (1165\u20131240). He established the Beshara Centre at Swyre Farm in Aldsworth, England, in 1970. A description of events at this center is given in the books I, Wabenzi by Rafi Zabor, and Beshara and Ibn 'Arabi: A Movement of Sufi Spirituality in the Modern World. ", "Later, Feild taught on the essence of the universality of Sufi teachings, making them available to people of all religious and spiritual backgrounds. He published more than a dozen books, some of which have been translated into many languages. In his autobiographical novel The Last Barrier, he gave a fictionalised account of how he met Bulent Rauf."]}, {"page": "History of Sufism", "response": ["Other noteworthy Sufi teachers who were active in the West include Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Inayat Khan, Nazim Al-Haqqani, Javad Nurbakhsh, Bulent Rauf, Irina Tweedie, Idries Shah and Muzaffer Ozak."]}, {"page": "B\u00fclent", "response": ["*Bulent Rauf, Turkish-British mystic, spiritual teacher, translator, and author"]}, {"page": "July 1911", "response": ["*Born: Bulent Rauf, Turkish mystic and spiritualist, in Beylerbeyi (d. 1987)"]}, {"page": "Faiza Rauf", "response": ["Princess Faiza did not want to marry a member of the Middle East royal family.
