Both Blackmore and Glover were unimpressed with the front cover quotation. It was remixed at Abbey Road Studios, London in 1991 by Lawrence and engineer Peter Vince and reissued on LP and CD. The re-release contained extra tracks not on the original release, and additional information and sleeve notes including an interview with Lawrence.
