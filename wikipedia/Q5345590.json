He is associated with the Norwich School of painters, a group of artists connected by location and personal and professional relationships, who were mainly inspired by the Norfolk countryside.\nBorn in London to wealthy parents, Daniell grew up and was educated in Norwich, where he was taught art by John Crome and Joseph Stannard. After graduating in classics at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1828, he was ordained as a curate at Banham in 1832 and appointed to a curacy at St. Mark's Church, London, in 1834. He became a patron of the arts, and an influential friend of the artist John Linnell. In 1840, after resigning his curacy and leaving England for the Middle East, he travelled to Egypt, Palestine and Syria, and joined the explorer Sir Charles Fellows's archaeological expedition in Lycia (now in Turkey) as an illustrator. He contracted malaria there and reached Adalia (now known as Antalya) intending to recuperate, but died from a second attack of the disease.\nHe normally used a small number of colours for his watercolour paintings, mainly sepia, ultramarine, brown pink and gamboge. The distinctive style of his watercolours was influenced in part by Crome, J. M. W. Turner and John Sell Cotman. As an etcher he was unsurpassed by the other Norwich artists in the use of drypoint, and he anticipated the modern revival of etching which began in the 1850s. His prints were made by his friend and neighbour Henry Ninham, whose technique he influenced. His paintings of the Near East may have been made with future works in mind.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "J. M. W. Turner", "response": ["Turner formed a short but intense friendship with the artist Edward Thomas Daniell. The painter David Roberts wrote of him that, \"He adored Turner, when I and others doubted, and taught me to see & to distinguish his beauties over that of others ... the old man really had a fond & personal regard for this young clergyman, which I doubt he ever evinced for the other\". Daniell may have supplied Turner with the spiritual comfort he needed after the deaths of his father and friends, and to \"ease the fears of a naturally reflective man approaching old age\". After Daniell's death in Lycia at the age of 38, he told Roberts he would never form such a friendship again."]}, {"page": "John Crome", "response": ["Crome was drawing master at Norwich School for many years.

The artist John Middleton was his pupil, but he was not a teacher and usually had no pupils. From 1824 he taught his friend Edward Thomas Daniell how to etch. Daniell, then a student at Oxford University, worked with Stannard during his holidays, and as Daniell's ability developed, the relationship between pupil and teacher became more equal. Daniell sued him when a newly built studio obscured his light; Stannard was forced to remove it after losing the case."]}, {"page": "David Roberts (painter)", "response": ["In London he made the acquaintance of artists such as Edward Thomas Daniell and John Linnell, who frequented Daniel's house."]}, {"page": "John Linnell (painter)", "response": ["John Linnell (16 June 179220 January 1882) was an English engraver, and portrait and landscape painter.

Stonemason James Watson completely refaced the keep with Bath stone, faithfully reproducing the original ornamentation., plate\u00a0XXXII The etcher and watercolourist Edward Thomas Daniell was one of the vociferous opponents of the refacing. A letter he wrote published in the Norwich Mercury in August 1830 referred to the \"scandalous re-facing of the ancient keep\". Although living in London during this period, letters to his friends the artist Henry Ninham and the botanist Dawson Turner reveal the extent of his opposition. In a letter to Turner, Daniell wrote, \"I have had a very beautiful drawing made of it, and I mean to etch it the size of the drawing. I can only say that if my etching be half as much like the castle, or half as good as the drawing, it will be more like, than anything yet done, of that very beautiful relic.\" To Ninham he wrote, \"Show me by a plan, how high they have got pulling down, and enable me to judge whether even now in the eleventh hour, any good can be done; and I in return will just inform you, how I stand with regard to my plate.
