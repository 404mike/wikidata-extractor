Paul Haylock played a cross towards the edge of the Swindon penalty area which Karl Elsey struck on the volley into the net past a static Digby.

Bamber, Parkin and Henry all had headers saved by Kite in the Gillingham goal, who was described in The Guardian as \"unbeatable... for a good hour\".

Henry controlled a pass from Berry with his chest and passed to Coyne, who took the ball past two Gillingham players before hitting a fierce shot into the goal from around .  Gillingham attacked again after Smith came on in place of Elsey, but Swindon's defenders closed down their opponents.
