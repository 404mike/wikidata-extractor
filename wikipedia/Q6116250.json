From January 1994, she appeared on permanent basis on the station every weekday between noon and 2.00\u00a0pm, presenting a mix of music, interviews and interactive news features. Her programme was praised by some but it proved unpopular with many who preferred the old mainstream pop fare. In Simon Garfield's 1998 book on Radio 1, The Nation's Favourite, Bannister claims that Freud was \"treated very badly by people at the station, especially other women\"."]}, {"page": "GMTV", "response": ["In July 2008, it was announced that McLean would quit working on GMTV to focus on her role on Loose Women, to share the permanent host job with Jackie Brambles.
