Beneath the Planet of the Apes was a success at the box office but met with mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by Escape from the Planet of the Apes.", "Soon after Planet of the Apes became a hit, a sequel started being considered by 20th Century Fox. Screenwriter Rod Serling was consulted, but his ideas did not interest the studio. Then the producers turned to the author of the original novel, Pierre Boulle, who wrote a draft for a sequel called Planet of the Men, where protagonist George Taylor would lead an uprising of the enslaved men to take back control from the apes as the gorilla general Ursus wants to fight humans. Boulle's script was rejected as it was felt that it lacked the \"visual shock and the surprise\" of the original. Associate producer Mort Abrahams then wrote story elements, and British writer Paul Dehn was hired to develop them into a script, tentatively called Planet of the Apes Revisited. Dehn implemented his trauma of the 1945 atomic bombings and the fear of nuclear warfare on the story. One of the elements thought up by Abrahams and Dehn was a half-human, half-ape child, but despite even going through make-up tests this was dropped due to the implication of bestiality.\"From Alpha to Omega: Building a Sequel\", Beneath the Planet of the Apes Blu-ray According to screenwriter Dehn the idea for Beneath the Planet of the Apes came about from the end of the first movie which suggested that New York City was buried underground.Russo, Joe and Landsman, Larry with Gross, Edward Planet of The Apes Revisited, 2001, pg. pg. 103. Thomas Dunne Books", "Director Franklin J. Schaffner was invited to return to the series, but declined due to a commitment to Patton. Television and film director Ted Post was approached, and while objecting to the script for \"not making a point at all\", the producers asked what he did not like. Post then wrote a letter saying that \"the loss of a planet is the loss of all hope\". Post tried to get the other writer of the original, Michael Wilson, but a budget cut prevented him from doing so. Post and Franciscus \u2013 who wanted to help clarify the actions of and give depth to the character of Brent \u2013 spent a week rewriting the script, leading to over fifty pages of notes suggesting story ideas to fix some of the narrative problems in Paul Dehn's script.Russo, Joe and Landsman, Larry with Gross, Edward Planet of The Apes Revisited, 2001, pg. 105.

Weiler of The New York Times wrote that the film was \"proof, in living color, that Heston is vulnerable and that a sequel to striking science fiction can be pretty juvenile.\" Variety panned the film as \"hokey and slapdash,\" adding, \"The dialog, acting and direction are substandard.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four: Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it a \"striking, imaginative picture,\" adding, \"Director Ted Post, writers Mort Abrahams and Paul Dehn are to be congratulated for sounding so timely a toll of doom in such an entertaining context.\"Thomas, Kevin (May 26, 1970). \"Sequel to 'Planet of the Apes'\".

Dehn also consulted Pierre Boulle, writer of the Planet of the Apes novel, to imbue his script with similar satirical elements.

Don Murray suggested to Thompson his wardrobe with a black turtleneck sweater, and rehearsed his scenes after translating his dialogue into German \"to get this kind of severe feeling of the Nazis\". Screenwriter Paul Dehn wrote the film incorporating references to the racial conflicts in North America during the early 1970s, and Thompson further highlighted by shooting some scenes in a manner similar to a news broadcast.
