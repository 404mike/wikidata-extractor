At his trial at the Old Bailey, he denied even having sympathy for the IRA, and no evidence was ever presented that he had any paramilitary links. Additionally, the IRA itself stated that he was not a member, and never claimed him as a \"prisoner of war\". However, his fingerprint was found on electronic circuits in an arms cache that was linked to the Hyde Park bombing. At his trial, he explained that he may have handled the circuits when working for a previous employer, who he did not know had IRA connections. After five hours of deliberation by the jury, McNamee was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison.In September 1994, McNamee and Paul Magee were among six prisoners who escaped from Whitemoor Prison, shooting and wounding a prison officer as they did so, before being captured two hours later.In 1997, his case was examined by Channel 4's Trial and Error programme. McNamee was later to be the first case referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and his conviction was overturned on 17 December 1998, because of other, much more prominent, fingerprints on the same circuits, belonging to known IRA bomb-maker Dessie Ellis (who received a ten-year sentence in Ireland for possession of explosives after the bombings, but before MacNamee's trial), which were not disclosed at McNamee's original trial. Despite quashing McNamee's conviction, the appeal judges stated, \"The Crown makes a strong case that the appellant [McNamee] was guilty of a conspiracy to cause explosions.\" Supporters of the campaign to clear his name included the comedian Jeremy Hardy.In February 1999, McNamee read the IRA Roll of Honour at the Burns and Moley commemoration and the following month he sat with the Caraher family during the trial of Michael Caraher and other members of the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade sniper team.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeremy Hardy", "response": ["Hardy supported Irish nationalist R\u00f3is\u00edn McAliskey, the then-pregnant daughter of Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, when the former was accused of involvement in an IRA mortar attack in Germany, and put up part of the bail money to free her. He also supported the campaign to free Danny McNamee, who remained unconvicted (but later found liable for) his involvement in the Provisional Irish Republican Army's (IRA) Hyde Park bombing on 20 July 1982."]}, {"page": "List of Northern Ireland\u2013related topics", "response": ["*Danny McNamee"]}, {"page": "David Jessel", "response": ["In 1990, the Rough Justice team decamped to Channel 4 and set up a production company, Just Television, dedicated exclusively to the investigation and publicising of miscarriages of justice.

On 7 July 1991, IRA prisoners Nessan Quinlivan and Pearse McAuley escaped from HM Prison Brixton, where they were being held on remand. They escaped using a gun that had been smuggled into the prison, wounding a motorist as they fled. On 9 September 1994 six prisoners\u2014an armed robber, Danny McNamee and four IRA members including Paul Magee\u2014escaped from HM Prison Whitemoor. The prisoners, in possession of two guns that had been smuggled into the prison, scaled the prison walls using knotted sheets. A guard was shot and wounded during the escape, and the prisoners were captured after being chased across fields by guards and the police. In March 1997 a  tunnel was discovered in H7 at the Maze Prison. The tunnel was fitted with electric lights, and was  from the outside wall, having already breached the block's perimeter wall. On 10 December 1997 IRA prisoner Liam Averill, serving a life sentence after being convicted of the murder of two Protestants, escaped from the Maze dressed as a woman. Averill mingled with a group of prisoners' families attending a Christmas party, and escaped on the coach taking the families out of the prison. He was not apprehended and was granted an amnesty in 2001."]}, {"page": "Paul Magee", "response": ["On 31 March 1993 Magee was found guilty of the murder of Special Constable Goodman and the attempted murder of three other police officers, and sentenced to life imprisonment.

A guard was shot and wounded during the escape, and the prisoners were captured after being chased across fields by guards and the police. In 1996 Magee staged a dirty protest in HM Prison Belmarsh, in protest at glass screens separating prisoners from their relatives during visits. Magee had refused to accept visits from his wife and five children for two years, prompting Sinn F\u00e9in to accuse the British government of maintaining \"a worsening regime that is damaging physically and psychologically\"."]}, {"page": "List of miscarriage of justice cases", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\" |Danny McNamee"]}, {"page": "McNamee", "response": ["*Danny McNamee (b. 1960) electronic engineer from Northern Ireland, convicted of terrorist bomb-making offences but later acquitted after 10 years imprisonment"]}, {"page": "Outline of Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Danny McNamee"]}, {"page": "Gilbert McNamee", "response": ["#redirect Danny McNamee"]}]}}
