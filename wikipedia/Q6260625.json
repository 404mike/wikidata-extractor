Smith claims that it was the poor quality of the work that Orford objected to. The principal source for Smith's account however, was Locatelli's student Rossi. Rossi may be coloured by his relationship with Locatelli, giving Smith the impression that Rossi's own skill as a sculptor was nothing to do with his former master's tutelage."]}]}}
