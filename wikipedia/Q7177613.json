It is not written in a Geordie dialect, but has a strong Northern connection.\nFor centuries, the Government Clergy (i.e. Rector, vicar, or perpetual curate etc.) had the right to collect from each household in a Parish, \u201cEaster Dues\u201d. This was based on a set sum (in the early/middle nineteenth century it was at the rate of 4p per person), and the head of the household had the duty to pay this sum on behalf of every member resident in the property of the age of 16 or more.Peter Watson objected to this compulsory payment reasoning that \u201cthe claims were founded neither in the law or in the gospels\u201d, and was duly summons (and jailed for a short time for non-payment) before the court judged that the collection of these under the Acts of William III were illegal, ruling that \"This act, or anything herein contained, shall not extend to any tythes, offerings, payments or oblations shall not extend\u2026.. \u2026within any city or town where the same are settled by Act of Parliament\" It is therefore the British public who are indebted to him for the removal of this \"odious, unjust and oppressive clerical tax\".\nNothing more appears to be known of this person, or his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Watson", "response": ["Peter Watson may refer to:", "*Peter Watson (shoemaker) (fl. 1824), shoemaker and political activist, Chester-le-Street, England", "*Peter Watson (arts benefactor) (1908\u20131956), British art collector, benefactor and publisher", "*Peter Watson (footballer, born 1934) (1934\u20132013), English footballer for Nottingham Forest and Southend United", "*Peter Watson (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u20132016), English footballer for Workington", "*Peter Watson (bishop) (born 1936), Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, 2000\u20132005", "*Peter Watson (musician) (born 1941), rock guitarist and member of English 1960s band The Action", "*Peter Watson (intellectual historian) (born 1943), English intellectual historian and author", "*Peter Watson (footballer, born 1944), Northern Irish footballer", "*Peter Watson (politician) (born 1947), member of the Western Australian parliament", "*Peter Watson (cyclist) (born 1950), English cyclist", "*Peter Watson (photographer) (born 1952), British landscape photographer"]}, {"page": "Peter Watson (Chester-le-Street shoemaker)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Watson (shoemaker)"]}, {"page": "Marshall's Collection of Songs, Comic, Satirical 1827", "response": ["|122||Peter Watson (To Mr) \u2013 (Who lays powerful bats on the knaves with fire-shovel hats on)||Henry Robson||not given||||||", "|122||short bio||Mr Peter Watson||||Opposed the claims of the Government Clergy for the Easter Dues or \"Clerical Tax\" \u2013 written 1824||||"]}, {"page": "List of Geordie characters, events and places", "response": ["* Peter Watson - The subject of a song/poem, a common shoemaker who opposed the claims of the Government Clergy for the Easter Dues or \"Clerical Tax\".
