Contemporary definitions of Frankish ethnicity vary both by period and point of view. The formulary of Marculf written about 700 AD described a continuation of national identities within a mixed population when it stated that \"all the peoples who dwell [in the official's province], Franks, Romans, Burgundians and those of other nations, live\u00a0\u2026 according to their law and their custom.\". Writing in 2009, Professor Christopher Wickham pointed out that \"the word 'Frankish' quickly ceased to have an exclusive ethnic connotation. North of the River Loire everyone seems to have been considered a Frank by the mid-7th century at the latest [except Bretons]; Romani [Romans] were essentially the inhabitants of Aquitaine after that\"."]}]}}
