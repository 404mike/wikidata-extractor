By the time he took over in January 1962, the team were already all but doomed to relegation and he used the time to experiment and plan for the future. Chelsea were duly relegated and in Docherty's first full season as manager he led them back to promotion as Second Division runners-up, secured with a crucial and hard-fought 1\u20130 win at rivals Sunderland (and a goal scored via Tommy Harmer's groin) and a 7\u20130 final day win over Portsmouth."]}, {"page": "John White (footballer, born 1937)", "response": ["At Spurs, White initially occupied the inside-left position, having been bought by Nicholson to replace Dave Dunmore, but his talent flourished as an inside right as a replacement to Tommy Harmer. He scored on his debut in October 1959, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. White's worth to the team could be calculated in terms of goals scored (between 1959 and the conclusion of the Double winning season (a season in which he was ever-present) he contributed 18 goals) but his success mainly lay in a combination of skills: his passing, his ball control which helped sustain the attacking momentum but so too his runs to find space off the ball, arriving unexpectedly in the opposition's penalty area which resulted in the White Hart Lane faithful giving him the nickname \"The Ghost\"."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2007", "response": ["*Tommy Harmer, 79, British footballer (Tottenham Hotspur, Watford and Chelsea)."]}, {"page": "Johnny Brooks", "response": ["Brooks was one of the earliest British footballers to endorse hair products, advertising Max Factor shampoo during the 1950s. Brooks' son Shaun was also a professional footballer and played for Leyton Orient, Crystal Palace, Bournemouth, was capped by England at schoolboy and youth level and managed Dorchester Town. After retiring from football, Brooks worked alongside friend and former teammate Tommy Harmer as a broker's messenger for Bank Hapoalim, until being made redundant at the age of 60. With the help of former teammate Micky Dulin, Brooks then became a park-keeper at Ridgeway Park in Chingford. Brooks retired and moved to Bournemouth in 1997.

A bad winter and the poor state of the White Hart Lane pitch were contributory, as the \"push and run\" style of play required a good firm playing surface.  The following years witnessed a period of decline, as great players aged but younger players such as Tony Marchi and Tommy Harmer were not yet experienced enough, and with injuries and other teams adapting to Spurs' revolutionary style of play, it meant a struggle for the once-dominant team. Spurs could only finish tenth in the 1952\u201353 season. The \"push and run\" team also started to disperse; Medley, Willis, Bennett and Burgess left to join other teams while Nicholson moved into coaching.  In 1954 Rowe signed future captain Danny Blanchflower for a club record fee of \u00a330,000.

After completing National Service with the RAF, Hills signed professional forms for the Spurs in August 1953. Originally an inside forward the club converted him to full back.

Hills started in the club's all-time record win, a 13\u20132 in an FA Cup replay against Crewe Alexandra on 3 February 1960. The highlight of his White Hart Lane career was the first shared 4\u20134 draw with Arsenal on 22 February 1958. The clubs shared their first 4\u20134 draw in Division One with the Gunners leading 4\u20132 with 86 minutes played before Tommy Harmer converted a penalty and Bobby Smith scored the equaliser.
