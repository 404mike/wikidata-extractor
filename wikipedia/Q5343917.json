Adjoining lands were granted to the Barrett family by King Charles II in 1660. Over one hundred years later, Thomas Southworth, a merchant from Kingston in partnership with John Kennion, a kinsman of Edward Kennion, changed the name of the estate from Green Pond to Green Park, and started to transform it from being a cattle farm, into a large sugar plantation. He died shortly after he commenced construction of the main residence in 1764. The estate was bequeathed to Atherton, then a Kingston merchant in 1765. The estate was fully functioning producing sugar, rum and holding livestock. It was Atherton who completed the build of the main residence and subsequently enlarged what is presently known as Green Park Great House."]}, {"page": "Green Park Estate, Jamaica", "response": ["In the 1760s Thomas Southworth, a merchant from Kingston in partnership with John Kennion, a kinsman of Edward Kennion, changed the name of the estate from Green Pond to Green Park, and started to transform it from being a cattle farm, into a large sugar plantation.
