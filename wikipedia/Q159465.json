Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show the works of Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist. Later Leo Castelli exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein for most of their careers.

Tapi\u00e9 was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial effect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded Tachisme, Color Field painting, Lyrical Abstraction, Fluxus, Pop Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Neo-expressionism, and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with Hard-edge painting (Frank Stella, Robert Indiana and others) and Pop artists, notably Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Roy Lichtenstein who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by Richard Hamilton in Britain.

He is well known for his sociologically engaged works that often discuss youth politics, accessibility and democracy.Hayes, David (2013).Financial Times 'Personal style: Stuart Semple', \"Financial Times\", October 2014.

Semple's work has strong links with Richard Hamilton's Pop Art, but has a contemporary emphasis on latent fear and threat rather than Hamilton's consumer culture and glamour.Kucharek, Jan-Carlos (2015).\"RIBA Journal\" \"It is the quietest of these artists' contributions on the social impact of regeneration in cities that talk the loudest\" RIBA Journal, 9 March 2015, Retrieved 11 March 2015.", "Eric Bryant debated Semple and contemporary Pop Art in a seminal ARTnews feature 50 years after Richard Hamilton had defined the movement. \"While earlier generations of Pop artists exhibited a similar love-hate relationship with consumer culture and glamour, this group takes on fear and violence.\"Bryant, Eric (2007).  \"Paint It Bleak\", Art News, Dec 2007. Retrieved from stuartsemple.com, 6 January 2007. Semple's relationship with current culture, politics and imagery has put him at the forefront of the next generation of debate, where artists now tackle the current climate of fear; \"his often disturbing, even sinister works also feature guns, pills, and frequent references to suicide.\" In being categorised within Pop Art, Aidan Duane debated in The Irish Times how his work brings it up to date.There is a real intelligence at the heart of his art. On the one hand he clearly embraces the throwaway, famous-for-15-minutes soundbite culture of celebrity and distraction. On the other, he stops it in its tracks, recasting its giddy imagery in the slow, fixed medium of paint. He might seem to celebrate it, but he actually doesn't quite trust the world of mass production and communications. His work implies a conviction that there is, or perhaps there better be, something genuine, something real, beyond the glam facade of throwaway culture. In Vogue Italia Stuart Semple discusses his critical relationship with Pop culture in a post Warhol society where it has become a universal language but aims to act removed.Clausi, Leonardo (2010) \"Commenti al moto contemporaneo\" Vogue Italia, 21 April 2010.
