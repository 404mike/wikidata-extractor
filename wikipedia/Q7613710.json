Richards started the season well when he helped Manchester City's defence to keep three clean sheets in the first three league matches, including against rivals, Manchester United. His performance was praised by Manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. As a result, he was named the Barclays player of the month award for August. Richards then captained the team for the first time on 16 September 2007 against Aston Villa in the absence of teammate Richard Dunne, making him the youngest ever City first team captain, beating the 21-year-old Steve Redmond. After the match, he said it was the \"proudest moment\" of his career. Following a 6\u20130 loss against Chelsea on 27 October 2007, Richards acknowledged his mistakes for conceding \"a couple of goals\" on his columns. After missing one match due to an injury, he returned to the starting line-up against Portsmouth on 11 November 2007, and kept a clean sheet, in a 0\u20130 draw. Since the start of the 2007\u201308 season, Richards regained his first team place, playing in the right\u2013back position. It was announced on 8 February 2008 that he signed an improved contract to last until June 2013. However, by the end of February, Richards suffered a knee injury that saw him sidelined for six weeks. Although he returned to training in early\u2013April, Richards never played for the side for the rest of the 2007\u201308 season. During the season, he was involved in heated rows with the opposition teams, which resulted in him getting booked. Despite this, Richards was nominated for a second time for the PFA Young Player of the Year award at the end of the 2007\u201308 season.
