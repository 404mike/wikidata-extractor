Johnson said the project had \"all the hallmarks of being an expensive folly and a potential financial blackhole\" and he would instead consider alternative ways to integrate and improve transport in the combined authority. The Conservative leader of East Cambridgeshire District Council, Anna Bailey, accused Johnson of acting without consulting the combined authority and leaving the area with \"no plan\". The Labour leader of Cambridge City Council defended Johnson as having \"a more practical focus\" and said that the autonomous metro plan had \"no fundability\". After suspending work on the proposed autonomous metro, Johnson commissioned a new transport plan focused on areas that have suffered from deprivation and equality, and on reducing carbon emissions. He blocked a proposal to spend \u00a3350,000 on consultants to study the aborted metro project, and started a review of the use of consultants with the intention of completing work internally as much as possible. He met with the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, in July to discuss options for transport."]}, {"page": "Tom Hunt (politician)", "response": ["After working as a parliamentary assistant for Oliver Dowden MP, Hunt worked as chief of staff to the Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, James Palmer.
