He joined his father and brother in Calcutta in 1855 and later joined the volunteer cavalry known as Havelock's Irregulars. During the Indian rebellion of 1857 he won medals and was mentioned in dispatches. In 1859 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 17th Lancers. He resigned in 1866.\nFrom 1868 to 1870, Goldsworthy was Inspector General of Police in Sierra Leone; during this time he married a widow named Eliza Egan. He was then commandant of the Hausa Armed Police and District Magistrate of Lagos until 1873. He then became Inspector of Customs for the Gold Coast until 1874. In 1874 he was made CMG for his role in the war with the Akumahs. His next appointment was as President of Nevis from 1876 to 1877.\nIn 1877, Goldsworthy was appointed Colonial Secretary of Western Australia, a position which also implied an appointment to the Western Australian Legislative Council. He took up both appointments on 30 August 1877, holding them until his resignation on 7 September 1880. Following this, he was Administrator and Colonial Secretary of Saint Lucia from 1881 to 1884; Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the British Honduras from 1884 to 1891; and Governor of the Falkland Islands from 1891 to 1897.\nGoldsworthy was made KCMG in 1889.

In 1933, Thomson's mother was cited in The Times as one of just nine remaining survivors of the Siege of Lucknow in 1857; if that is accurate, it explains the name of the house, but she is likely on grounds of age to have been Goldsworthy's step-daughter rather than a direct descendant.
