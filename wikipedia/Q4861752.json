Substitute Kevin Connolly brought a terrific save from D. D. Quinn, and along with Murray and Parlon, clipped over points to give them renewed hope. Loughgiel weathered the storm, thanks in no small part to some heroic defending from Paul Gillan, and hit back with scores from Watson and Barney McAuley. Watson landed a point from a tight angle to stretch the lead out to eight with Coolderry struggling. Murray pulled back a couple of points from expertly struck frees and Eoin Ryan steered over a neat score, but there was to be no stopping the Shamrocks, with Watson powering over an 80-metre free, before McCarry pointed after Stephen Corcoran had pulled off a top quality save from Casey."]}, {"page": "2006 Christy Ring Cup Final", "response": ["Carlow raised the tempo for the second half. Pat Coady landed a free and two '65's to help his side pare back the difference to 3-8 to 0-6 by the 53rd minute. Carlow hit four of the second half's opening five points with substitute Se\u00e1nie McMahon firing over the best of the lot from a tight angle on the left. Antrim steadied themselves on 56 minutes when Barney McAuley dangled a ball deep into Carlow territory and McIntosh latched onto it to thump home goal number four off the ground. A Coady free was then batted off the Antrim line before Foley notched his second point for a 4-8 to 0-7 score line. More Antrimk points followed before a strong 66th minute run from Malachy Molloy ended with McFall netting the fifth goal. Foley scored a penalty for Carlow, however, the difference in standard was apparent and Antrim powered to an 18-point victory."]}]}}
