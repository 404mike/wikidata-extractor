Thus, as late as 1965, the sinologist Joseph Needham suspected Arab interpolation.Needham, Joseph. (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology; Part 2, Mechanical Engineering. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. p.236. However, Carra de Vaux, author of the French translation which still provides the basis for modern scholars, regards the Pneumatics as essentially genuine.Carra de Vaux: \"Le livre des appareils pneumatiques et des machines hydrauliques de Philon de Byzance d'apr\u00e8s les versions d'Oxford et de Constantinople\", Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et des Belles Artes: notice et extraits des mss. de la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale, Paris 38 (1903), pp.27-235 The historian of technology George Sarton (1959) also asserts that it is safe to assume the Arabic version is a faithful copying of Philo's original, and credits Philon explicitly with the invention.Sarton, George. (1959). A History of Science: Hellenistic Science and Culture in the Last Three centuries B.C. New York: The Norton Library, Norton & Company Inc. SBN 393005267. pp.343\u2013350. So does his colleague Michael Lewis (2001). In fact, research by the latter scholar (1997) demonstrates that the Arab copy contains sequences of Greek letters which fell out of use after the 1st century, thereby strengthening the case that it is a faithful copy of the Hellenistic original, a view recently also shared by the classicist Andrew Wilson (2002)."]}, {"page": "Andrew Wilson", "response": ["*Andrew Wilson (artist) (1780\u20131848), Scottish landscape-painter", "*Andrew Wilson (presenter) (born 1960), British news presenter and foreign correspondent", "*Andrew Wilson (actor) (born 1964), American actor and director", "*Andrew Wilson (musician), frontman for New Zealand punk trio Die!
