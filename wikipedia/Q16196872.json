Conditions underfoot were poor with a heavily waterlogged pitch, and the first goal came about in the fourth minute when a number of players slipped, including Wolverhampton Wanderers captain Floyd Streete, and Ian McDonald scored.  Kendall made a number of saves including one in the 40th minute to deny Mike Ring which Mike Ward, writing in the Sandwell Evening Mail, described as a \"rescue act of quite stunning brilliance\".  Bull saw two attempts to score denied by Aldershot defenders before half-time and within thirty seconds of the start of the second half, Streete was adjudged to have handled the ball from a clearance by Nicky Clarke, his teammate. Bobby Barnes scored the resulting penalty.
