In March 1961, he married D\u00e9chevaux-Dumesnil in a civil ceremony in Folkestone. On the face of it, this was to make sure that, if he died before her, D\u00e9chevaux-Dumesnil would inherit the rights to his work because there was no common-law marriage under French law. He may also have wanted to affirm his loyalty to her. In June 1961, Bray moved to Paris, and despite his recent marriage, Beckett spent much of his time with her.Cronin, op. cit., p. 500 This side of his life was not well known, as Beckett's reserve was \"allied to his fear of giving offence to Suzanne\".Cronin, op. cit., pp. 517-518 Beckett's play Play (1963) seems to be inspired by these events."]}, {"page": "Guillaume B\u00e9libaste", "response": ["*Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error. translated by Barbara Bray.

Bray had a long career as an  editor, translator, and critic. She is also noted as the longtime companion and mistress of Samuel Beckett, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. Besides Galileo, she wrote two other screenplays with Losey. Their screenplay for Galileo relies primarily on the \"American\" version of Brecht's play that was first performed in 1947. This English language version was written between 1944 and 1947 by Brecht with Charles Laughton, his collaborator and translator. The play was produced in Los Angeles, California and then in New York City, with Laughton (a famed film actor) starring as Galileo. The play was first published in 1952.The American version of Galileo is included as one chapter of a collection. See  Bray and Losey's screenplay made changes in this version that reflect the ultimate 1956 \"Berlin version\" (in German), as well as the English translation of the Berlin version and additional materials published by Ralph Manheim and John Willett in 1972.
