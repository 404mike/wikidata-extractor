His best-known song is the \"Liverpool Lullaby\" or \"The Mucky Kid\" which was recorded in 1965 on the Three City Four LP and sung by Marian McKenzie. It was also sung by the Ian Campbell Folk Group on the Contemporary Campbells LP. It was later recorded by Judy Collins in 1966 for her album In My Life. Cilla Black recorded it three years later as the B-side to her pop hit \"Conversations\". Kelly-Bootle achieved the first postgraduate degree in computer science in 1954, from the University of Cambridge.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of programmers", "response": ["*Stan Kelly-Bootle \u2013 Manchester Mark 1, The Devil's DP Dictionary"]}, {"page": "Furlong", "response": ["The furlong is also a base unit of the humorous FFF system of units.Stan Kelly-Bootle, \"As Big as a Barn?\", ACM Queue, March 2007, pp. 62\u201364."]}, {"page": "September 15", "response": ["*  1929   \u2013 Stan Kelly-Bootle, English singer-songwriter, computer scientist, and author (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "The Computer Contradictionary", "response": ["The Computer Contradictionary is a non-fiction book by Stan Kelly-Bootle that compiles a satirical list of definitions of computer industry terms.
