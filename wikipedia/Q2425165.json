She was an influential member of the Royal Horticultural Society, and a recipient of the first Victoria Medal of Honour, awarded to British horticulturists living in the UK by the society, in 1897. Willmott was said to have cultivated more than 100,000 species and cultivars of plants and sponsored expeditions to discover new species. Inherited wealth allowed Willmott to buy large gardens in France and Italy to add to the garden at her home, Warley Place in Essex. More than 60 plants have been named after her or her home, Warley Place.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 19", "response": ["*1858 \u2013 Ellen Willmott, English horticulturalist (d. 1934)"]}, {"page": "September 27", "response": ["*1934 \u2013 Ellen Willmott, English horticulturalist (b. 1858)"]}, {"page": "1858", "response": ["**Ellen Willmott, English horticulturalist (d. 1934)"]}, {"page": "1934", "response": ["*September 27 \u2013 Ellen Willmott, English horticulturalist (b. 1858)"]}, {"page": "Heston", "response": ["* Horticulturist Ellen Willmott (1858\u20131934) was born in Heston."]}, {"page": "1934 in science", "response": ["* September 27 \u2013 Ellen Willmott (born 1858), English horticulturist."]}, {"page": "1858 in science", "response": ["* August 19 \u2013 Ellen Willmott (died 1934), English horticulturist."]}, {"page": "Essex Wildlife Trust", "response": ["|In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries this site was the garden of the leading horticulturalist, Ellen Willmott, who planted many plants from all over the world, some of which still survive.
