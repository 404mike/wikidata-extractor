According to Guttenplan, Vassiliev could never explain how he managed, despite being required to leave his files and notebooks in a safe at the KGB press office at the end of each day, to smuggle out the notebooks with his extensive transcriptions of documents.Guttenplan, Red Harvest.

Working closely with Robert Faurisson, who was also assisting the defence, Irving contacted Warden Bill Armontrout of the Missouri State Penitentiary who recommended that Irving and Faurisson get into touch with Fred A. Leuchter, a self-described execution expert living in Boston. Irving and Faurisson then flew to Boston to meet with Leuchter, who agreed to lend his alleged technical expertise on the behalf of Z\u00fcndel's defence. Irving argued that an alleged expert on gassings like Leuchter could prove that the Holocaust was a \"myth\". After work on the second Z\u00fcndel trial, Irving declared that based on his exposure to Z\u00fcndel's and Leuchter's theories that he was now conducting a \"one-man intifada\" against the idea that there had been a Holocaust.. Subsequently, Irving claimed to the American journalist D. D.

For example, Myra MacPherson (All Governments Lie! The Life and Times of Rebel Journalist I. F. Stone, 2006) reported that Kalugin said: \"We had no clandestine relationship. We had no secret arrangement. I was the press officer [of the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C.] ... I never paid him anything.

Nonetheless, the Vassilev notebook shows that Lippman was meeting Pravdin, not to pass the intelligence to him, but rather to find out what the true intentions of the Soviet government were. One of the KGB reports said, \"He [Lippmann] is attempting to use his acquaintance with him [Pravdin] to determine our viewpoint on various issues of international politics. He is doing this, of course, very subtly, with the utmost tact. It should be recognized that by attempting to draw 'Sergei' into making candid comments, Imperialist [Lippmann] is sharing his own information with him\".Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev, Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America, p. 177.", "*D.
