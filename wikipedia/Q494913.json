It abandoned the policy in 1989 when it signed Irish international John Aldridge from Liverpool. Aldridge scored 16 goals in his first season to be the club's top scorer, and fourth-highest scorer of the entire league as La Real finished fifth. In 1990, La Real signed an English striker, Dalian Atkinson of Sheffield Wednesday, who therefore became the club's first black player. He scored 12 goals in his first season, second at the club only to Aldridge's 17. That was Aldridge's final season at La Real, and he left to play in the lower English leagues at Tranmere Rovers, while Atkinson left to top-flight Aston Villa."]}, {"page": "Burntwood", "response": ["* Dalian Atkinson Ex Aston Villa Footballer"]}, {"page": "Dean Saunders", "response": ["Here, he developed a strong partnership with Dalian Atkinson until the latter suffered an injury midway through the season.
