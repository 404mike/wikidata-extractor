Harvie has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region since 2003.\nBorn in Dunbartonshire, Harvie attended the Manchester Metropolitan University, where he was a member of the Labour Party. From a young age he was active in politics, having attended a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament demo, while still in a pram. Harvie worked for a sexual health organisation, which led him into campaigning for equality. His experience of campaigning to repeal Section 28, led him to join the Scottish Green Party. Harvie was elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2003 election, representing the Glasgow region.\nIn September 2008, Harvie was appointed as male co-convenor of the Scottish Greens, serving alongside Eleanor Scott, Martha Wardrop and Maggie Chapman. In 2019, following a constitutional change in the Green Party, he ran for co-leadership in the August election. He was elected alongside Lorna Slater. As Slater was not an MSP at the time, Alison Johnstone fulfilled her role within the Scottish Parliament, until May 2021. In August 2021, after entering a power-sharing agreement with the SNP, Harvie and Slater were both appointed to the Scottish Government as junior ministers, becoming the first Green Party politicians in the UK to serve in government.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Patrick Harvie (born 1973), co-convenor of the Scottish Greens since 2003"]}, {"page": "Hate crime", "response": ["Under Scottish Common law the courts can take any aggravating factor into account when sentencing someone found guilty of an offence.
