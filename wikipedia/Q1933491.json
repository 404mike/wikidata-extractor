However, with both Salmon and Ammann injured towards the end of the 1995\u201396 season, Petterson played well enough in the final nine games, conceding only five goals and helping the club to the play off Semi Finals, to earn a new contract. He began the following season as Salmon's deputy, but after his return to the side in January 1997 became first choice, winning the club's player of the year award at the end of the season. The start of the 1997\u201398 season saw Petterson as Charlton's first choice keeper, but after 26 appearances lost his place to first Salmon and then Sasa Ilic as Charlton Athletic gained promotion to the Premier League via a Wembley play-off final win over Sunderland. Petterson started the 1998-99 Premier League season for Charlton Athletic as deputy to Ilic and made his first appearance as a substitute in a 2\u20131 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He then started the next game as the Addicks defeated West Ham United 4\u20132 at the Valley. Petterson again returned to the substitute's bench after Ilic was declared fit before he was allowed to join Portsmouth on loan in November 1998 as cover for Alan Knight. Petterson stayed until February, helping Pompey survive relegation in 1999 before returning to an unsuccessful relegation battle for Charlton Athletic as the South London club returned to the Championship after just one season in the top flight."]}, {"page": "Phil Harrington", "response": ["Harrington made his first\u2013team debut for Chester in a 3\u20131 home win over Huddersfield Town on 20 February 1982. He went on to make 76 appearances over the next three years, amid competition from Grenville Millington, Mike Salmon, Billy O'Rourke and John Butcher. Harrington was first\u2013choice goalkeeper at Chester by the end of 1982\u201383, but an injury in the penultimate game of the season at Torquay United prematurely ended his campaign and led to defender Noel Bradley having to deputise for him. But Harrington recovered in time for one of his most memorable games for Chester in a League Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers in September 1983, when he saved the first three Bolton penalties in the penalty shoot-out to give Chester victory. This season saw him miss just five games for Chester, but unfortunately the campaign ended with the club finishing bottom of The Football League."]}, {"page": "Jason Brown (footballer)", "response": ["Brown began his career playing youth football as a defender for Fisher Athletic before converting to a goalkeeper at the age of 14. He later played one season for Sydenham, winning a local league and cup double. During this season the side conceded just four goals during their campaign, with him featuring alongside Anwar Uddin and Terrell Forbes. His performances attracted the attention of several London based clubs, including Fulham and Queens Park Rangers. He eventually signed for Charlton Athletic after two of his friends also joined up with the club. Brown struggled as an apprentice during his first season at The Valley, suffering home sickness and later rupturing his hamstring. This injury kept him out of the team for several months but he was able to return to action the following year after training alongside first team goalkeeper Mike Salmon."]}, {"page": "Leyland, Lancashire", "response": ["* Mike Salmon, retired goalkeeper, who currently works as a football manager"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Mike Salmon"]}, {"page": "Cross-border derby", "response": ["|Mike Salmon||1982||16||0||1987, 1987\u201389||100||0"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1980s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Mike Salmon"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mike Salmon"]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Fourth Division play-off Final", "response": ["The first leg of the final was played at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham and ended goalless.
