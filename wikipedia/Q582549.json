He made his competitive debut for the club in the League Cup in August 2008, and his first appearance in the Football League while on loan to Hereford United the following year. He also spent loan spells in the Championship with Doncaster Rovers and Watford, and became a first-team regular for Birmingham, before leaving for Cardiff City in 2012. Mutch contributed to Cardiff's promotion to the Premier League in his first season, and after their relegation in 2014 he returned to the top flight with Queens Park Rangers. Unable to establish himself in their first team, he signed for Crystal Palace in January 2015. Mutch spent the second half of the 2017\u201318 season on loan to Reading and the 2018 Major League Soccer season with Vancouver Whitecaps FC, before leaving Palace by mutual consent in January 2019. After short spells with South Korean K League 1 club Gyeongnam, Aalesund of the Norwegian Eliteserien, and Australian A-League club Western Sydney Wanderers, he joined Macarthur FC in 2021.\nHe has represented his country at levels from under-17 to under-21.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jordon", "response": ["*Jordon Mutch (born 1991), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Alvaston", "response": ["*Jordon Mutch, an England U21 footballer who plays for Crystal Palace"]}, {"page": "List of foreign MLS players", "response": ["*Jordon Mutch \u2013 Vancouver \u2013 2018"]}, {"page": "Noel-Baker Academy", "response": ["* Jordon Mutch - Birmingham City football club midfielder"]}, {"page": "Ross McCormack", "response": ["On 17 August 2012, he signed a new three-year deal with the club.

He made his first-team debut in a 3\u20131 home defeat to former club West Bromwich Albion in March, coming into the starting eleven in place of the injured Martin Jir\u00e1nek.
