He has been described in Video Watchdog magazine as occupying 'a proud place in the advance guard of film researchers, writers and critics.'In his parallel career as an actor, Rigby played the psychic researcher Harry Price in the part-animated 2017 feature film Borley Rectory: The Most Haunted House in England. Previously he played Kenneth Horne throughout the eighteen-month run of the West End hit Round the Horne ... Revisited (2003\u201305); the production was adapted for  BBC Four and featured in the 2004 Royal Variety Performance. In 2008-09 he reprised the role in a regional tour of Round the Horne - Unseen and Uncut and in the BBC Radio special Twice Ken is Plenty, then in 2017\u201318 he appeared in a new stage show called Horne A'Plenty. Some of his earlier theatre work, particularly in Shakespeare, is discussed by Owen Dudley Edwards in the 1991 book City of a Thousand Worlds: Edinburgh in Festival.Rigby's stage adaptation of Dracula toured during 1997, the original novel's centenary year, and in 2013-14 he directed a successful revival of the forgotten Sylvia Rayman play Women of Twilight. He is also an Associate Research Fellow of the Cinema and Television History Research Centre at De Montfort University, Leicester, and has contributed audio and/or video commentaries to the DVD/Blu-ray releases of numerous horror films. In 2010 he was series consultant on the three-part BBC Four documentary A History of Horror, also making a brief appearance as Dracula in the opening episode. Two years later he was programme consultant on the feature-length follow-up, Horror Europa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Round the Horne", "response": ["The persona adopted by the writers for Horne was not greatly different from his real-life one, and largely the same as that of his Beyond Our Ken character: the urbane, unflappable, tolerant but sometimes surprised central figure, around whom the other characters revolved. The Times called Horne the \"master of the scandalous double-meaning delivered with shining innocence\", and in Round the Horne he combined the role of straight man to the flamboyant Julian and Sandy, Rambling Syd Rumpo and J.Peasmold Gruntfuttock with that of genial host of the show. Feldman called him \"the best straight man I had ever seen\", who nonetheless had \"a lot of funny lines\"; Jonathan Rigby, who played Horne in a stage show, Round the Horne\u00a0... Revisited, thought him \"a stand-up comedian with a posh accent\u00a0... part of his genius was that he was able to be himself\".", "A stage version, Round the Horne\u00a0... Revisited, was adapted from the original radio scripts by Brian Cooke, the last surviving writer of the series, and directed by Michael Kingsbury. It was first produced in October 2003 at the White Bear, a fringe theatre in south London, and opened in the West End at The Venue, Leicester Square in January 2004, running for more than a year. It featured Jonathan Rigby as Horne, Robin Sebastian as Williams, Nigel Harrison as Paddick, Kate Brown as Marsden and Charles Armstrong as Smith. A scene from the show featured in the 2004 Royal Variety Performance at the London Coliseum. Following the success of the London production, a second cast was assembled to tour the provinces. Stephen Critchlow played Horne, with Stephen Matthews, David Rumelle, Felicity Duncan and Oliver Beamish as Williams, Paddick, Marsden and Smith. The original show ran in London until December 2004, when it was replaced by a Christmas edition with an unchanged cast. A third edition, Round the Horne Revisited 2, rounded off the London run from February to April 2005, and then made a provincial tour."]}, {"page": "John Houseman", "response": ["Houseman was portrayed by Cary Elwes in the Tim Robbins-directed film Cradle Will Rock (1999).

A story about a mysterious oriental person who pursues a British politician to London, where he wreaks havoc with his powers of hypnosis and shape-shifting, Marsh's novel is similar in some respects to certain other novels of the same period, such as Bram Stoker's Dracula, George du Maurier's Trilby, and Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu novels. Like Dracula and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others during the 1860s, The Beetle is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late 19th-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense. The novel engages with numerous themes and problems of the Victorian fin de si\u00e8cle, including the New Woman, unemployment and urban destitution, radical politics, homosexuality, science, and Britain's imperial engagements (in particular those in Egypt and the Sudan). \"The Beetle\" sold out upon its initial printing, and continued to sell well and to be published for several decades into the 20th century. The novel was made into a film in 1919, with Leal Douglas in \"the polymorphous title role\",Jonathan Rigby, English Gothic: A Century of Horror Cinema (Reynolds & Hearn, 2004), p. 16 and adapted for the London stage in 1928."]}, {"page": "Dracula Society", "response": ["As well as its regular membership the society also presents Honorary Life Memberships; current holders include Richard Dalby, Christopher Frayling, Jonathan Rigby, Janina Faye and Caroline Munro, and former holders include Michael Carreras, Radu Florescu, Raymond T.
