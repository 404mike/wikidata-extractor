She was an active suffragist, and member of the Woman Writers' Suffrage League. She once dressed up as a demure, rebel Jane Austen for a suffrage fundraising event. Sinclair was also a significant critic in the area of modernist poetry and prose, and she is attributed with first using the term 'stream of consciousness' in a literary context, when reviewing the first volumes of Dorothy Richardson's novel sequence Pilgrimage (1915\u20131967), in The Egoist, April 1918.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anne Bront\u00eb", "response": ["It is easy to underestimate the extent to which the novel challenged the social and legal structures.

A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books,1984), pp. 660\u20131). The term was coined by Alexander Bain in 1855 in the first edition of The Senses and the Intellect, when he wrote, \"The concurrence of Sensations in one common stream of consciousness (on the same cerebral highway) enables those of different senses to be associated as readily as the sensations of the same sense\" (p.\u00a0359).William C.

Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Bront\u00ebs.\" In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel \u2014 while acclaiming it as \"the first presentment of that Feminist novel\", she stated that \"it bores to tears.\" Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: \"If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines.\" The only thing Sinclair wholly approved of was the author's treatment of marital laws of the time: \"Anne Bront\u00eb attacks her problem with a freedom and audacity before which her sisters\u2019 boldest enterprises seem cowardly and restrained...
