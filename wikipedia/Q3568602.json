T. A. Hoffmann, in which Mlle de Scudery establishes the innocence of the police's favorite suspect in the murder of a jeweller. This story is sometimes cited as the first detective story and as a direct influence on Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841). Also suggested as a possible influence on Poe is \u2018The Secret Cell\u2019, a short story published in September 1837 by William Evans Burton. It has been suggested that this story may have been known to Poe, who in 1839 worked for Burton. The story was about a London policeman who solves the mystery of a kidnapped girl. Burton's fictional detective relied on practical methods such as dogged legwork, knowledge of the underworld and undercover surveillance, rather than brilliance of imagination or intellect."]}, {"page": "1860 in literature", "response": ["*February 9 \u2013 William Evans Burton, English dramatist, theatre manager and publisher (born 1804)"]}, {"page": "1837 in literature", "response": ["*September \u2013 In Burton's Gentleman's Magazine (Philadelphia), William Evans Burton publishes an early example of the detective story, \"The Secret Cell\", featuring a London police officer and his wife."]}, {"page": "The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket", "response": ["Many reviewers commented on the excess of violent scenes.
