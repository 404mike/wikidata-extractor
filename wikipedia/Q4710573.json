Jenkins was one of the greatest backs to have played for Llanelli and is compared to later Scarlet heroes Lewis Jones and Phil Bennett. Jenkins was a strong tackler and was an extremely fast runner from a standing start. He was also an excellent kicker with either foot and could punt the ball half the length of the pitch. He was sometimes criticised for his decision making on the field, and wasn't at his best away from Stradey Park.In the book Stradey Stories, author Alun Wyn Bevan comments, \"such was his drawing power that if by some quirk of fate, Albert could not take to the field because of injury or work commitment (he was a steelworker), the fans would leave the stadium in droves and not bother to watch the ensuing match.\"Jenkins is seen as one of Llanelli's greatest players but he was at his peak when Welsh rugby was at one of its worst points in its history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albert Jenkins", "response": ["Albert Jenkins may refer to:", "*Albert Jenkins (footballer) (1861\u20131940), English footballer who formed Doncaster Rovers in 1879", "*Albert Jenkins (rugby union) (1895\u20131953), Welsh international rugby union player"]}, {"page": "1895 in Wales", "response": ["*11 March \u2013 Albert Jenkins, rugby player (died 1953)"]}, {"page": "Albert jenkins (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Jenkins (rugby union) "]}, {"page": "Albert Jenkins (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Jenkins (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Jenkins", "response": ["*Albert Jenkins (footballer) (1865\u22121940), English footballer who formed Doncaster Rovers in 1879.", "*Albert Jenkins (rugby union) (1895\u20131953), Welsh international rugby union player", "*William Albert Jenkins (1878\u20131968), British politician, former MP for Brecon and Radnor"]}]}}
