As Ipswich were in a poor run of form both domestically and in European competition, manager Bobby Robson had declared the FA Cup contest against Cardiff as \"the most important match the club is going to play this season\". Ipswich won the match 2\u20130 with both goals coming from Paul Mariner, the England international centre forward.  The match also saw captain Mick Mills making his 494th appearance for Ipswich, a club record.  Ipswich were drawn against Fourth Division Hartlepool United in the fourth round.  A controversial penalty awarded to Ipswich in the sixth minute was converted by Colin Viljoen after Derrick Downing was adjudged to have fouled Mariner.  Ipswich extended their lead with a second from Mariner before Downing pulled one back for Hartlepool.  Second half goals from Brian Talbot and Viljoen ended the tie 4\u20131 in favour of the East Anglian team who progressed to the fifth round where they faced Bristol Rovers.  The game was played on a frozen Eastville Stadium pitch and the lower league team came into the match against Ipswich having lost just two of their previous fourteen matches.  A Talbot throw-in was collected by Clive Woods whose cross was converted by Robin Turner.  Rovers' equaliser came early in the second half as Ipswich goalkeeper Paul Cooper failed to clear a corner which was subsequently headed in by midfielder David Williams.  Fifteen minutes later, the Bristol club took the lead, Williams scoring after a Russell Osman clearance.  Bobby Gould then scored for Rovers but the goal was disallowed and with four minutes to go, Mariner secured an equaliser to send the game to a replay at Portman Road.  Ipswich pressed early on but with no reward for their domination and had to wait until the 26th minute to capitalise.  A corner from Woods was converted by Mick Mills at the far post.  As Rovers went in search of an equaliser, Mariner scored following good passing work from Allan Hunter and Mills.  Woods scored a third with ten minutes remaining to end the match 3\u20130 and send Ipswich into the sixth round to face Millwall.", "|FW ||11|| Clive Woods"]}, {"page": "Charlie Woods", "response": ["When Sir Bobby Robson became Ipswich Town Manager (1969\u201382) Woods, having retired as a player, became youth team coach and went on to coach players such as Alan Brazil, Paul Mariner, Clive Woods, George Burley, Paul Cooper, Kevin Beattie and Brian Talbot, who became the core of the Ipswich Town UEFA Cup-winning team in 1981\u201382, and runners-up in the English First Division in 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382.

Bobby Robson led the club to finish fourth in the First Division 1972\u201373 season and qualified for the 1973\u201374 UEFA Cup where their opponents in the first round were Spanish team Real Madrid.  A deflected shot from Mick Mills proved to be the only goal of the game, marred by the referee being struck by a projectile from the crowd which had caused a two-minute delay.  The second leg in Madrid ended goalless allowing Ipswich to progress to the second round 1\u20130 on aggregate.  The second round draw saw Ipswich face Italian team Lazio, the first leg to be played at Portman Road.  Trevor Whymark scored four times, twice in each half, to enable Ipswich to take a 4\u20130 lead back to Rome.  The return leg in the Stadio Olimpico was a bad-tempered affair.  Despite taking an early two-goal lead, Lazio conceded a penalty with fifteen minutes remaining which Colin Viljoen converted; he was punched and kicked on his way to for the restart.  Full beer cans were thrown from the crowd which were subsequently used by Lazio players as missiles against both the Ipswich players and the referee. Union Jacks were burnt by some members of the crowd.  On the pitch, Lazio's Giorgio Chinaglia completed his hat-trick but a last-minute goal from David Johnson ended the leg 4\u20132, with Ipswich going through 6\u20134 on aggregate.  At the final whistle, the Ipswich players sprinted off the pitch during which goalkeeper David Best was injured by the Lazio supporters. The team were locked in their dressing room for their own protection from the home supporters for more than an hour.    Robson later remarked \"Lazio were human beings gone berserk!\"  Ipswich faced FC Twente of the Netherlands in the third round, winning the first leg on a frozen and snow-covered Portman Road pitch 1\u20130 courtesy of a late Whymark goal who tapped the ball into an empty net after Twente goalkeeper Piet Schrijvers palmed away a shot from Clive Woods.  The return leg in Enschede ended 2\u20131 in Ipswich's favour, with second half goals from Bryan Hamilton and Peter Morris, the tie ending 3\u20131 on aggregate.  Once again violence affected the game with Hamilton being punched to the ground out of the referee's vision, and four Ipswich fans requiring hospital treatment after clashing with Twente supporters.  The quarter final draw paired Ipswich with Lokomotive Leipzig. The first leg, played at Portman Road, ended 1\u20130 with a late goal from Kevin Beattie after Ipswich \"had done everything but score\".  Robson noted that Leipzig should be happy with the result, suggesting \"they were only just short of a thrashing\".  The second leg saw Mick Mills being sent off late in the first half for what he claimed to be a retaliatory foul on East German international player Wolfram L\u00f6we.  Five minutes into the second half,  scored from a L\u00f6we corner, and the game ended 1\u20130, with an aggregate score of 1\u20131 sending the game into penalties. At 3\u20133, it was sudden death; Allan Hunter's penalty was then saved by Werner Friese, and Ipswich were out."]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Clive Woods"]}]}}
