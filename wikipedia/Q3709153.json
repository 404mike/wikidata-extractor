Avis is a professor in computational geometry and applied mathematics in the School of Computer Science, McGill University, in Montreal. Since 2010, he belongs to Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, School of Informatics, Kyoto University.\nAvis received his Ph.D. in 1977 from Stanford University. He has published more than 70 journal papers and articles.
