Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \"Hombre\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \"Galang\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \"a more analogue sound\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \"refreshing\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on the album, but was unable due to budget constraints and other artists' unfamiliarity with her work. She chose to perform all the vocals herself, saying, \"I just quietly got on with it\u00a0... I didn't wanna convince anyone it was good. I felt it was much better to prove that I could be an individual.\""]}, {"page": "Galang (song)", "response": ["\"Galang\" is a song by British musician M.I.A. from her debut album Arular. It was released on Showbiz Records in 2003 as her first single, which pressed 500 vinyl copies, gaining immediate international recognition via radio airplay, fashion shows, club rotations and internet filesharing. \"Galang\" was re-released on 1 November 2004 via XL Recordings as the second single from the album released by the label and was released for a third time as \"Galang '05\" on 11 October 2005 by the label and in the US by Interscope Records. It is written by Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam, Justine Frischmann, Ross Orton and Steve Mackey. It first appeared on M.I.A.'s six song demo tape in 2003, her official MySpace account on 9 June 2004 and was later reworked slightly by Orton and Mackey who received production credit for the song. \"Galang\" was the second song M.I.A. wrote on her Roland MC-505, intending for the piece to be performed by Frischmann's band Elastica. Inspired by her experiences and observations of life in London, M.I.A. wrote the song to encourage her friends in the band to continue to make music. However, after cowriting the song, Frischmann convinced M.I.A. to record \"Galang\" herself, complimenting the piece's lyrical narrative and music direction.", "\"Galang\" is a moderately fast song, with a tempo of 101 beats per minute. It combines dancehall, jungle, electroclash and worldbeat with folk style chants, and is set in common time. The song features sparse instrumentation throughout, consisting primarily of minimal \"jarring\" polyrhythm beats written with a drum machine and \"blaring\" Moog synthesiser sounds as the song's riff. Its rhythms are influenced by traditional Sri Lankan songs, and feature beeps, bloops and electronic loops. It is in verse-chorus form before the fourth and final chorus and a vocal coda. Composed in London using a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the Roland MC-505, and a radio microphone, M.I.A. recorded \"Galang\" in the same vein as the rest of Arular, the song eventually becoming part of a six song demo tape that included \"Lady Killa\", and her first ever composition \"M.I.A.\" Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\". Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, under the name Cavemen, worked further on \"Galang\" with M.I.A in a professional studio, where she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song a more analogue sound than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \"refreshing\" due to Frischmann's experimental approach to lyrical themes. Speaking openly about the lyrical origins of the song, she said \"This was only the second track I ever wrote, so I was still experimenting. I just wanted to put down all the advice everyone had said to me about how to survive in London.\"", "Category:Songs written by Ross Orton"]}, {"page": "Sunshowers", "response": ["\"Sunshowers\" is a song by British musician M.I.A. from her debut studio album, Arular.
