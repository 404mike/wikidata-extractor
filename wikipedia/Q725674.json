He made appearances in many television programmes, including a portrayal of Imperial Japanese Army Major Yamauchi in the British drama series Tenko and as Entwistle in Last of the Summer Wine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["Between November 1963 and February 1964, Sellers began filming A Shot in the Dark, an adaptation of a French play, L'Idiote by Marcel Achard. Sellers found the part and the director, Anatole Litvak, uninspiring; the producers brought in Blake Edwards to replace Litvak. Together with writer William Peter Blatty, they turned the script into a Clouseau comedy, also adding Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Cato. During filming, Sellers's relationship with Edwards became strained; the two would often stop speaking to each other during filming, communicating only by the passing of notes. Sellers's personality was described by others as difficult and demanding, and he often clashed with fellow actors and directors. Upon its release in late June 1964, Bosley Crowther noted the \"joyously free and facile way\" in which Sellers had developed his comedy technique.", "Following Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough said that Sellers \"had the genius comparable to Chaplin\", while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as \"a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts he gave to the world. For them, he is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment.\" Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that \"Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain\u00a0... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything\". Director Blake Edwards thought that \"Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing\". Sellers's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said \"I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him\"; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, \"Anything to avoid paying for dinner\". Secombe later declared to journalists \"Bluebottle is deaded now\". Milligan later said that \"it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time.\""]}, {"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["Burt Kwouk, "]}, {"page": "Inspector Clouseau", "response": ["A Shot in the Dark (1964) was based upon a stage play that originally did not include the Clouseau character. In this film, Sellers began to develop the exaggerated French accent that later became a hallmark of the character. The film also introduces two of the series regular characters: his superior, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who is driven mad by Clouseau's blundering of the investigation; and his long-suffering Chinese manservant, Cato (Burt Kwouk), who is expected to improve Clouseau's martial arts skills by attacking him at random.", "Despite the failure of Curse, Edwards attempted to revive the series a decade later with Son of the Pink Panther, in which it is revealed that Clouseau, who had died ten years prior, had illegitimate children by Maria Gambrelli (played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark, although recast in this film as Claudia Cardinale, who played the Princess in The Pink Panther). Clouseau's son, Jacques Jr., was portrayed by Roberto Benigni, and has a twin sister, Jacqueline, played by Nicoletta Braschi. Jacques Jr. attempts to follow in his father's police footsteps, but is revealed to have inherited his ineptitude.

Elke Sommer, George Sanders, Graham Stark, Tracy Reed and Douglas Wilmer also appeared in the film.", "More than a decade after his previous portrayal, Peter Sellers returned as Clouseau in 1975's The Return of the Pink Panther.  The film marked the return of the famous \"Pink Panther\" diamond as well as most of the creative team associated with the prior films, including director Blake Edwards, composer Henry Mancini, Herbert Lom as Dreyfus, Burt Kwouk as Cato and Andr\u00e9 Maranne as Fran\u00e7ois. David Niven did not reprise the role of Sir Charles Lytton, who is portrayed in the film by Christopher Plummer instead.

Once again, regular Panther co-stars return \u2013 Herbert Lom, Burt Kwouk, and Graham Stark, and a star of the original 1963 film, Claudia Cardinale. Although intended to relaunch the series with the blundering Jacques as a lead, Son failed both critically and commercially and became the final installment in the original Pink Panther series.

Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series, featuring somewhat younger actors. This format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself as a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley.
