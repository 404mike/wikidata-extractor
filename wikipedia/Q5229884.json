William Jones argued that only personal information as a tangible resource can be managed, whereas personal knowledge cannot . Dave Snowden has asserted that most individuals cannot manage their knowledge in the traditional sense of \"managing\" and has advocated thinking in terms of sensemaking rather than PKM . Knowledge is not solely an individual product\u2014it emerges through connections, dialog, and social interaction (see Sociology of knowledge).
