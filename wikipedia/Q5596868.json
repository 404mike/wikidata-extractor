The engine however was difficult to start, loud, inefficiently lubricated, and prone to breakages, particularly the quite long, exposed push rods. Over time quality improved dramatically. Combined with the vehicle's light weight, the powerplant made the car quite fast for its size, capable of speeds approaching , and boasting quite good acceleration. ABC was originally part of the Harper Bean combine, and was based in Hersham, Surrey and Harper Bean supplied castings, stampings, and forgings utilized on the first ABCs.

This gained a reputation for being unreliable and was dropped in 1924. It was replaced by a 1250\u00a0cc conventional 4-cylinder model, the 10/20 or RM, and a 1696\u00a0cc six the 14/30.

Instead of being suspended from an alloy cradle as on the Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle bolted to a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy steering head bracket. This bracket, holding the engine and front wheel unit is bolted to a cast alloy bulkhead which forms a major structural component of the car. The engine mounting was said to have been a regular source of failures on both the Mark A and the Mark B, and this new design was again the work of Granville Bradshaw."]}, {"page": "Unit construction", "response": ["In 1914, ABC founder Granville Bradshaw designed a unit-construction horizontally opposed ('flat') twin for Sopwith Aircraft, who, at the time, also made motorcycles.

Only Granville Bradshaw (creator of the ABC motorcycle) had successfully used an oil-cooled engine in a motorcycle. The engine, designed by Ing. Dauben (who later joined Mercedes on the W144 - W146 racers) had no external oilways, making a very clean design.  The engine finning acted as a giant radiator, with recirculating oil the cooling agent.  The single overhead camshaft was driven by a train of gears at the front of the engine. Very few 4-cylinder production motorcycles of the pre-War period had an overhead camshaft (a notable rival was the first iteration of the Ariel Square Four of 1931). The 63x60mm short-stroke engine produced 22\u00a0hp at 4,000rpm, which gave an 80\u00a0mph+ top speed. The Windhoff chassis had no \u2018frame\u2019 to speak of, and the engine/gearbox unit was used as a stressed member, with the forks and rear subframe (4 parallel tubes) bolt directly onto it. The trailing-link forks use double leaf springs for damping, with no rear suspension; the rear frame tubes emerge straight out of the gearbox casting, and hold the final drive housing for the shaft drive, and rear hub and brake. Despite its massive appearance, the total weight of the machine was only 440\u00a0lbs. The price when new was 1,750DM, a bit more than the contemporary 750cc BMW R63 (1,600DM). "]}]}}
