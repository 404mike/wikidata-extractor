Douglas and the Rev R.F. Borough - see A history of the ecumenical movement, Volume 1; Rouse R., Neill S. and Fey, H.E.: SPCK, 1970.  The Church Intelligencer (Volume 23, Issue 11, November 1906) expressed its concern in an article entitled A New Disorder in the Church \u2013 The Anglican and Eastern Orthodox Churches Union: \"Simultaneously with the appearance of the Report of the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline, there came into existence a new Ritualistic society, the composition of which is as full of significance as the present crisis in our National Church\". from its foundation in July 1906 until 1914 and thereafter of its successor, the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association.The Union published annual reports between 1906 and 1914 and a magazine, Eirene, which Fynes-Clinton edited for some years from 1908 to 1914.  By 1914 it had approximately 2,000 members in Britain and a branch in the United States.  See The Times, 24 October 1908, p. 19, column F for a report of the Union's early activities. It merged in 1914 with the Eastern Church Association, which had been founded at the residence of William Denton at 48 Finsbury Circus on 13 April 1863. Fynes-Clinton remained active in the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association until 1933, when he was ousted from its leadership following his call for reunion with Rome. Godfrey Benson, 1st Baron Charnwood settled the issue in a private conversation with Fynes-Clinton. \"He agreed to resign the Hon. Secretaryship, but to continue on the Committee if desired.  In a long and, to me, extremely difficult conversation, no man, from whom I profoundly and amiably differed, could have inspired more personal respect in me than he did.\" (Sobornost incorporating Eastern churches review, Fellowship of St. Alban and St. Sergius, Volume 1 No. 1, 1979).

Fynes-Clinton, to whom the development of the rapprochement between the Anglican and Eastern-Orthodox Churches is due more than to any living man\". Fynes-Clinton was joint secretary, with R.W. Seton-Watson, of the committee established in 1916 to disseminate knowledge of Serbia throughout Great Britain and draw a tighter bond between the two countries.
