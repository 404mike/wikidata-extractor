After two years on the books with KSC Cleary's agent, Bernd Wulffen, was in negotiations with Eintracht Frankfurt following a successful 4 day trial period, but communication between parties broke down for unknown reasons. As a result, in 2004, Cleary moved to England and signed a non-contract with Barnsley FC, but soon left for Worksop Town FC with Assistant Manager, Ronnie Glavin and four other players. Cleary was rumored to be making a move to Sheffield Wednesday F.C. or Doncaster Rovers F.C. after his performances in his team's FA Cup games.
