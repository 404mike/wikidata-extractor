The view that tests accurately predict future educational attainment is reinforced by Nicholas Mackintosh in his 1998 book IQ and Human Intelligence,: \"Despite widespread belief to the contrary, however, there is ample evidence, both in Britain and the USA, that IQ tests predict educational attainment just about as well in ethnic minorities as in the white majority.\" and by a 1999 literature review by .", "Stereotype threat is the fear that one's behavior will confirm an existing stereotype of a group with which one identifies or by which one is defined; this fear may in turn lead to an impairment of performance. Testing situations that highlight the fact that intelligence is being measured tend to lower the scores of individuals from racial-ethnic groups who already score lower on average or are expected to score lower. Stereotype threat conditions cause larger than expected IQ differences among groups. Psychometrician Nicholas Mackintosh considers that there is little doubt that the effects of stereotype threat contribute to the IQ gap between black people and white people."]}, {"page": "Cyril Burt", "response": ["Nicholas Mackintosh edited Cyril Burt: Fraud or Framed?, which was presented by the publisher as arguing that \"his defenders have sometimes, but by no means always, been correct, and that his critics have often jumped to hasty conclusions. In their haste, however, these critics have missed crucial evidence that is not easily reconciled with Burt's total innocence, leaving the perception that both the defence and prosecution cases are seriously flawed.\"Publisher's book description. https://www.amazon.com/Cyril-Burt-N-J-Mackintosh/dp/019852336X the first use of \"critics\" refers to Burt's attackers; the second use of \"critics\" refers to Burt's defenders, so is confusing W. D. Hamilton claimed in a 2000 book review shortly before Hamilton's death that the claims made by his detractors in the so-called \"Burt Affair\" had been either wrong or grossly exaggerated.", "However, Nicholas Mackintosh himself, then Emeritus Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge, expressed his own opinions in 1995. He summed up the evidence against Burt, saying that the data Burt presented were \"so woefully inadequate and riddled with error\", that consequently \"no reliance (could) be placed on the numbers he present(ed)\", and went on to confirm his agreement with Kamin's original conclusion, that Burt had fabricated his data.Mackintosh, 1995"]}, {"page": "Classical conditioning", "response": ["Latent inhibition might happen because a subject stops focusing on a CS that is seen frequently before it is paired with a US. In fact, changes in attention to the CS are at the heart of two prominent theories that try to cope with experimental results that give the R\u2013W model difficulty. In one of these, proposed by Nicholas Mackintosh, the speed of conditioning depends on the amount of attention devoted to the CS, and this amount of attention depends in turn on how well the CS predicts the US. Pearce and Hall proposed a related model based on a different attentional principle Both models have been extensively tested, and neither explains all the experimental results. Consequently, various authors have attempted hybrid models that combine the two attentional processes. Pearce and Hall in 2010 integrated their attentional ideas and even suggested the possibility of incorporating the Rescorla-Wagner equation into an integrated model."]}, {"page": "Richard Lynn", "response": ["Another review of Dysgenics was written in 2002 by Nicholas Mackintosh, emeritus professor of experimental psychology in the University of Cambridge. Mackintosh wrote that \"with a cavalier disregard for political correctness, he argues that the ideas of the eugenicists were correct and that we ignore them at our peril\". While recognising that the book provides a valuable and accurate source of information, he criticised Lynn for \"not fully acknowledg[ing] the negative relationship between social class and education on the one hand, and infant mortality and life expectancy on the other\". He questioned Lynn's interpretation of data. He also points out that according to Lynn's reading of the theory of natural selection, \"if it is true that those with lower IQ and less education are producing more offspring, then they are fitter than those of higher IQ and more education\". According to Mackintosh, eugenicist arguments are not based on a \"biological imperative, but rather on a particular set of value judgements\"."]}, {"page": "Stuart Sutherland", "response": ["Among psychologists, Sutherland is best known for his theoretical and empirical work in comparative psychology, particularly in relation to visual pattern recognition and discrimination learning.  In the 1950s and 1960s he carried out numerous experiments on rats but also on other species such as octopus; the two-factor theory of discrimination learning that he developed with Nicholas Mackintosh was an important step in the rehabilitation of a cognitive approach to animal learning after the dominance of strict behaviourism in the first half of the twentieth century.  He was also interested in human perception and cognition, and in 1992 he published Irrationality: The enemy within, a lay reader's guide to the psychology of cognitive biases and common failures of human judgement.", "*Mechanisms of animal discrimination learning, 1971 (with Nicholas Mackintosh)"]}, {"page": "Race Differences in Intelligence (book)", "response": ["A review by Nicholas Mackintosh, Emeritus Professor in the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, expresses astonishment that Lynn infers that Kalahari bushmen, with an average measured IQ of 54, should be regarded as mentally retarded; and that an 8-year-old European child with the equivalent mental age would have no problems surviving in the same desert environment. Mackintosh questions Lynn's hypothesis that migration to more harsh northern climates and ice ages selected for higher IQ by pointing to harshness of environments such as the Australian Outback. Lynn argues that racial differences in brain size indicates different evolutionary pressure on intelligence. Mackintosh argues that the cranial capacity of early Homo sapiens, 100,000 or more years ago, was rather greater than that of modern Europeans. He criticizes Lynn for reporting data incorrectly, in some cases from studies by Mackintosh himself. He writes: \"The errors may not be particularly important, and I do not know how typical they are.
