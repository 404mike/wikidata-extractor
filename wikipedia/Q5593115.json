He also played for the Detroit Express and the California Surf in the NASL.\nWhile at Newcastle United, Oates scored an own goal in a match against Leeds United directly from the kick-off, lobbing goalkeeper Willie McFaul in the process. McFaul is said to have been well out of position in the execution of the preplanned play.While a member of the Detroit Express, Oates coached the Bloomfield Hills Andover High School boys soccer team through the 1978 and 1979 seasons. In his first stint as a head coach, Oates led the 1978 squad to the Michigan High School State Soccer Championship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Graham Oates", "response": ["Graham Oates may refer to two footballers:", "*Graham Oates (footballer, born 1943), who played for Blackpool, Grimsby Town and Wigan Athletic", "*Graham Oates (footballer, born 1949), who played for Bradford City, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United"]}, {"page": "Oates (surname)", "response": ["*Graham Oates (footballer, born 1943), English footballer", "*Graham Oates (footballer, born 1949), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Graham Oates (footballer born 1949)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graham Oates (footballer, born 1949)"]}]}}
