It is published triannually (spring, summer, and winter) by the Science Fiction Foundation. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction has called it \"perhaps the liveliest and indeed the most critical of the big three critical journals\" (the others being Extrapolation (journal) and Science Fiction Studies). A long-running feature was the series of interviews and autobiographical pieces with leading writers, entitled \"The Profession of Science Fiction\", a selection of which was edited and published by Macmillan Publishers in 1992. Several issues have been themed, including #93 (A Celebration of British Science Fiction, 2005), published also as part of the Foundation Studies in Science Fiction. The hundredth edition (Summer 2007) was unusual in that it was an all-fiction issue, including stories by such writers as Vandana Singh, Tricia Sullivan, Karen Traviss, Jon Courtenay Grimwood, John Kessel, Nalo Hopkinson, Greg Egan, and Una McCormack.
