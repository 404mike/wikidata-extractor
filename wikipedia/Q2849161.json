In this new position he scored 31 goals in the 1984\u201385 season with many set up by Vic Kasule. Slaven won the 1984\u201385 Daily Record Golden Shot award in the process. Ritchie would not enjoy the benefits of his decision though, as he was replaced by Joe Baker early in the season, and Baker went to also appoint Slaven as club captain. Slaven went on to be named as both the club's and the division's Player of the Year. During this time as a semi-professional he was working as a gardener, but Rovers chairman Tom Fagan demanded \u00a340,000 to sell Slaven, which was a high price for a non-professional third-tier player. Slaven refused to play for Rovers, and was subsequently contacted by a reporter from The Sunday Post, who wrote to 54 English and Scottish clubs on his behalf. Middlesbrough responded to the letter with the offer of a two-week trial."]}]}}
