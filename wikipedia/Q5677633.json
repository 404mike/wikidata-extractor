A successful school cricketer at Millfield School, he played for England's Under-19 team in Tests in Sri Lanka in 1986\u201387. In these three matches, he took seven wickets and also scored an unbeaten 50 in the final match at Galle.\nHe made his debut for Somerset in 1988 and played fairly regularly for nine seasons, without ever quite appearing to make the decisive breakthrough to be an automatic selection. His most successful seasons were 1991 and 1992: he took around 50 first-class wickets in each season and in 1992 against Gloucestershire, in the last first-class match played at the Wagon Works Ground at Gloucester, he took seven for 52 in each innings to give both his best innings and match figures.But the following year Somerset recruited Mushtaq Ahmed as the county's overseas player and Trump's opportunities were more limited. Also, his batting never developed, and he failed to reach 50 in first-class matches. He did not appear in first-class matches after 1996 and played only a few more List A games before retiring to become, like his father, a schoolteacher. He has since played a few times for Herefordshire in the Minor Counties.\nHarvey is now Head of Secondary at Regent International School, Dubai.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herefordshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Harvey Trump"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Harvey Trump (1988\u20131996) 106 matches CA"]}, {"page": "1988 Youth Cricket World Cup", "response": ["* Harvey Trump"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Harvey Trump"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Millfield", "response": ["* Harvey Trump, Somerset cricketer"]}, {"page": "Trump (surname)", "response": ["* Harvey Trump (born 1968), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1978\u2013)", "response": ["* Harvey Trump (1988) : H.
