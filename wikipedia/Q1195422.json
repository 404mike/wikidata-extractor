Although he campaigned on a Chartist platform, he promoted the idea that more progress would come from new attitudes than from new laws. His primary work, Self-Help (1859), promoted thrift and claimed that poverty was caused largely by irresponsible habits, while also attacking materialism and laissez-faire government. It has been called \"the bible of mid-Victorian liberalism\" and had lasting effects on British political thought.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 16", "response": ["*  1904   \u2013 Samuel Smiles, Scottish-English author (b. 1812)"]}, {"page": "George Stephenson", "response": ["George Stephenson (9 June 1781 \u2013 12 August 1848) was a British civil engineer and mechanical engineer. Renowned as the \"Father of Railways\", Stephenson was considered by the Victorians a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement. Self-help advocate Samuel Smiles particularly praised his achievements. His chosen rail gauge, sometimes called 'Stephenson gauge', was the basis for the  standard gauge used by most of the world's railways.", "George first courted Elizabeth (Betty) Hindmarsh, a farmer's daughter from Black Callerton, whom he met secretly in her orchard. Her father refused marriage because of Stephenson's lowly status as a miner.Samuel Smiles disputes this account, saying that Miss Hindmarsh's brother assured him that she didn't meet him before 1818 or 1819. See Lives of the Engineers 1862 vol 3. p116 (footnote).", "The Victorian self-help advocate Samuel Smiles had published his first biography of George Stephenson in 1857, and although attacked as biased in the favour of George at the expense his rivals as well as his son, it was popular and 250,000 copies were sold by 1904. The Band of Hope were selling biographies of George in 1859 at a penny a sheet, and at one point there was a suggestion to move George's body to Westminster Abbey. The centenary of George's birth was celebrated in 1881 at Crystal Palace by 15,000 people, and it was George who was featured on the reverse of the Series E five pound note issued by the Bank of England between 1990 and 2003.

Jean de la Placette, the minister of Nay, He studied at Puylaurens, the Academy of Saumur, and the Academy of Sedan, receiving the degree of doctor in theology, it is said, at the age of seventeen.

Silane itself, as well as trichlorosilane, were first synthesised by Friedrich W\u00f6hler and Heinrich Buff in 1857 by reacting aluminium\u2013silicon alloys with hydrochloric acid, and characterised as SiH4 and SiHCl3 by Charles Friedel and Albert Ladenburg in 1867. Disilane (Si2H6) followed in 1902, when it was first made by Henri Moissan and Samuel Smiles by the protonolysis of magnesium silicides. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that Alfred Stock began to study silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the boron hydrides. The names silanes and boranes are his, based on analogy with the alkanes.E. Wiber, Alfred Stock and the Renaissance of Inorganic Chemistry,\" Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 49 (1977) pp. 691\u2013700.J. W. Mellor, \"A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry,\" Vol. VI, Longman, Green and Co. (1947) pp. 223\u2013227. The Moissan and Smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, so that the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method of producing substituted silanes."]}, {"page": "Thatcherism", "response": ["Nigel Lawson, Thatcher's Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1983 to 1989, listed the Thatcherite ideals as \"free markets, financial discipline, firm control over public expenditure, tax cuts, nationalism, 'Victorian values' (of the Samuel Smiles self-help variety), privatisation and a dash of populism\".

Its structure was based upon the design of the Eddystone Lighthouse, which had been built by John Smeaton \u2014 but Stevenson made several improvements on that design. John Rennie was a consulting engineer on the project. After the project was complete, there was some contention as to who should get more credit\u2014Rennie or Stevenson. That contention grew particularly strong as between the two men\u2019s sons when they were older - Robert\u2019s son Alan Stevenson and John Rennie\u2019s son, Sir John Rennie..
