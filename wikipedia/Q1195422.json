Although he campaigned on a Chartist platform, he promoted the idea that more progress would come from new attitudes than from new laws. His primary work, Self-Help (1859), promoted thrift and claimed that poverty was caused largely by irresponsible habits, while also attacking materialism and laissez-faire government. It has been called \"the bible of mid-Victorian liberalism\" and had lasting effects on British political thought.", "link_mentions": {}}}
