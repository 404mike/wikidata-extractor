He was called to the English Bar by the Middle Temple in 1932, and practiced on the Northern circuit based in Liverpool.\nWith an interest in politics, Currie was elected to Wirral County Borough Council and served as Chairman of the Council in 1938\u201339. During the Second World War he served with the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and was on the staff of Lord Dowding at RAF Fighter Command, later switching to the legal branch.\nAt the 1950 general election Currie fought as Conservative candidate for East Flintshire, a safe Labour seat. He fought this seat again in the 1951 election.\nHe was then selected for North Down where the sitting Ulster Unionist MP Patricia Ford was retiring after only two years. He won the seat in May 1955 and on 19 December made his maiden speech in a debate on the White Fish Subsidy (United Kingdom) No. 2 Scheme.\nCurrie easily kept the seat which he represented for fifteen years before himself retiring at the 1970 general election. His successor was James Kilfedder former West Belfast MP.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North Down (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["North Down is one of the most overwhelmingly unionist parts of Northern Ireland, with nationalist parties routinely getting no more than 5% of the vote, if that. In the 1955 election George Currie, the Ulster Unionist candidate, gained 96.8% of the popular vote, which he \"bettered\" in 1959 with some 98%. These shares of the popular votes are the highest ever achieved in a United Kingdom general election (post 1832 Reform). However it has arguably the most volatile and unpredictable politics of the entire province. Whereas elsewhere there are effectively three fundamental battles fought in elections \u2013 between the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party to be the leading unionist party, between the Social Democratic and Labour Party and Sinn F\u00e9in to be the leading nationalist party, and between unionism and nationalism as a whole, North Down is different. The lack of any substantial nationalist vote renders the last two battles immaterial. Of Northern Ireland's five main parties, only the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland have historically had a significant organisation and support in the constituency, though the Democratic Unionist Party has recently started to gain a foothold where previously it was nearly non-existent.", "| George Currie"]}, {"page": "Campbell College", "response": ["*George Currie, Northern Irish barrister and politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| George Currie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| George Currie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| George Currie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| George Currie"]}, {"page": "List of Ulster Unionist Party MPs", "response": ["| George Currie"]}, {"page": "Currie (surname)", "response": ["* George Currie (1905\u20131978), Northern Ireland barrister and politician", "* George Currie (born 1950), Scottish musician and amateur archaeologist"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["*George Currie, Ulster Unionist, North Down, 1959: 98.0%", "*George Currie, Ulster Unionist, North Down, 1955: 96.9%"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (G)", "response": ["# George Currie (Northern Irish politician)"]}, {"page": "George Currie", "response": ["George Currie may refer to:", "* George Currie (Northern Irish politician) (1905\u20131978), Northern Irish barrister and politician", "* George Currie (musician) (born 1950), Scottish musician and amateur archaeologist", "* George Currie (academic) (1896\u20131984), Scottish-born agricultural scientist and Vice Chancellor of Universities in Australia and New Zealand", "* George Currie (British politician) (1870\u20131950), British politician"]}, {"page": "1955 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland", "response": ["|George Currie"]}, {"page": "1959 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland", "response": ["|George Currie"]}, {"page": "1964 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland", "response": ["|George Currie"]}, {"page": "1966 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland", "response": ["|George Currie"]}]}}
