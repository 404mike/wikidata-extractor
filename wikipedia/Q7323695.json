She was also briefly a presenter of the weekday late show during 1999 whilst fellow DJ Richard Allinson covered the drivetime slot. In 2001, Parsons' show received two hours of phone calls after rival Virgin Radio DJ Jon Holmes requested that his listeners call Parsons to request John Denver's Annie's Song be played. From 2003 she was a stand-in presenter on the network. She had her own early Sunday morning show on Radio 2 from January to April 2010, and later that year stood in for Sarah Kennedy after Kennedy was absent from her Dawn Patrol programme. It was announced on 3 September that Kennedy would not be returning to the network and that Parsons would continue to present the show until a shake up of the Radio 2 schedule in October.

As explained in the program, the production of \"Heart of Glass\" was built around the use of a Roland CR-78 drum machine. The CR-78 was first introduced in 1978, the same year that Parallel Lines was recorded, and the use of this device on \"Heart of Glass\" was, according to the program, among the earliest uses of this device in popular music.
