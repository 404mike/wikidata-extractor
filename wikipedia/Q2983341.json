In the 72nd minute of a tight game between two teams who were essentially jostling for position in the playoffs, albeit Leeds 'mathematically' still able to gain automatic promotion, when Villa's Jonathan Kodjia was injured and remained on the ground, Tyler Roberts passed the ball up the line to Mateusz Klich who took it up the left wing and put the ball into the far corner past Jed Steer. The goal \u2013 the first of the game \u2013 sparked pandemonium, with Villa's Conor Hourihane, Ahmed Elmohamady, Neil Taylor and Leeds' Patrick Bamford caught up in a fracas with Klich at its centre, which involved several additional players from both sides and was eventually broken up by referee Stuart Attwell, Elland Road stewards and other players. In the immediate aftermath, Attwell sent off the peripherally involved Anwar El Ghazi with a straight red card (subsequently rescinded by The FA) and Bielsa's response to his players was, in the interests of fairness and after consulting with Villa boss Dean Smith, that his team should allow an unchallenged equaliser to be scored (the manager can be seen shouting \"Give the goal! Give the goal!\" from the touchline). From the restart, Albert Adomah essentially walked the ball into net unchallenged by 10 Leeds players, with only a frustrated and disbelieving Pontus Jansson giving chase and nearly dispossessing the forward. The game remained 1\u20131 and put the second automatic promotion spot mathematically out of reach for Leeds and see them enter the play-offs. Bielsa and the team were subsequently awarded the 2019 FIFA Fair Play Award on 23 September 2019, for their actions during this game, with the FIFA citation noting that \"The game finished 1\u20131, ultimately allowing their promotion rivals Sheffield United to guarantee their automatic spot in the Premier League, at Leeds\u2019 expense.

Starting in his preferred position of central midfield for the first time, Addison impressed enough to retain his place for the subsequent match away to Barnsley. This was the start of a run of 15 consecutive appearances in the first team, which was only ended when suspension for reaching five yellow cards ruled him out of the League Cup 4th round tie against Leeds United. Addison formed a formidable midfield partnership with Paul Green during this time as the Rams embarked on a run of only two defeats in 13 matches and moved from the bottom of the table to the fringes of the playoff places. Addison's form earned high praise from Jewell as an example to the club's other academy players and saw him sign a new three-and-a-half-year deal with the club on 2 September to keep him at the club until 2011. November saw Addison linked with a \u00a32 million move to Premier League Stoke. However, Jewell denied this, saying \"I spoke to Tony (Pulis, Stoke manager) about another matter and he never mentioned it. We are not going to sell Miles Addison. He won't be getting sold. Everybody has their price I guess, but we have worked too hard over the past year and gone through too many tortures to now start selling our best players\". Addison was denied his first goal for the club in the controversial East Midlands derby on 2 November 2008 when Stuart Attwell incorrectly ruled two late Addison headers which would have given Derby a 2\u20131 win, with the match instead finishing 1\u20131. but eventually got his first professional goal with the second in a 3\u20130 home win over Sheffield Wednesday on 15 November 2008. On 20 December 2008, he captained the side for the whole game against Watford, as the result ended in a 1\u20130 win. Addison said \"it was a dream to captain the side who I support\". Addison was substituted during Derby's 4\u20131 win over Blackpool, an injury which was later diagnosed to be a stress fracture of his foot, which ruled him out for the rest of the 2008\u201309 season.

The Attwell controversy overshadowed Derby's run of only one defeat in 11 and their retention of the Brian Clough Trophy. It also stretched Derby's unbeaten streak against Forest to five, having lost just once to their rivals in the last 11 meetings. Following the Forest game however, Derby's form began to stutter \u2013 despite two wins over League One clubs Brighton & Hove Albion (4\u20131) and Leeds United (2\u20131) in the League Cup, taking Derby to their first quarter-final in the competition since 1989, Derby won just one of their next four league games, a 3\u20130 win over Sheffield Wednesday that gave them their biggest league win since a 5\u20131 win over Colchester United in May 2007. The club's dip in form saw Jewell making vocal his desire to bring fresh legs and impetus into a squad being hit by injuries and a busy fixture list, whilst assistant manager Chris Hutchings called for greater 'consistency'. Despite the club's disappointing form they remained in contention for the play-offs.
