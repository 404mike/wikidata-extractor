The champion at that time was Harry Kelley and a race was arranged for 29 September 1859 from Putney to Mortlake. The stake was \u00a3200 a-side. The race was close for the first mile, but then Chambers began to pull away from Kelley and finally won by 200 yards. He was the first oarsman from the provinces to win this prestigious title and his backers rewarded him with a purse of 100 gold sovereigns. Chambers was now undisputed champion of the Tyne and Thames. Before 1876, the English Sculling Championship was considered to be the premier event in professional sculling. In 1876, the English Title gained the World status and earlier winners were retrospectively given the title of World Champion.", "Chambers subsequently lost the Championship to Harry Kelley, the Thames sculler, in 1865, in a race held on the Thames. Kelley retired but Chambers then won the title back in an open race with Joseph Sadler in 1866.

He won a succession of other sculling races and began to have difficulty in finding opponents who would take him on. He therefore entered several local regattas, which paid smaller prize money. His career took a marked upward turn when he entered for a sculling race at the Thames Regatta in 1868. Renforth won the race, beating Harry Kelley amongst others and received a \u00a390 prize.

On the top slab is the representation of a wherry bottom upwards, over which is thrown a coat and badge, and by the side are broken sculls. This slab is supported by four figures cut out of the solid stonework, one at each corner. The figures represent four champions of the Thames : first, Robert Coombes,  in his rowing costume, holding a broken scull; second, Tom Cole, of Chelsea, wearing Doggett's Coat and Badge, with the peculiar pineapple button ; third, James Messenger, of Kingston, with the coat and badge of the Thames National Regatta; fourth, Harry Kelley, of Putney, an athlete in rowing costume.

His opponent was T. Hoare, who was reputed the second greatest contemporary oarsman after English sculling champion Harry Kelley, of whom Sadler was a pupil. Sadler won easily, and the following year on 22 November 1866, contested the English Sculling Championship against Robert Chambers. Kelley, Sadler's mentor, had retired that year, leaving the championship title an open race between Sadler and Chambers. Halfway through the race Sadler seemed to have the measure of his opponent, but Chambers took the lead and did not relinquish it.", "Sadler's next Championship race, on 15 November 1875, was against R.W. Boyd of Durham, to whom Sadler had previously lost by three-quarters of a length in a mile race on the Tyne. The championship race was held on the Putney to Mortlake course and the stake was \u00a3200 a side. Boyd darted away and soon took a long lead but then faded. Sadler rowed steadily, overtook his opposition, and went on to win very comfortably in a time of 28m.05s. Sadler announced he would not return to training. This suggested that the race would have been Sadler's last. However, his actual final Championship race came on 27 June 1876, when he lost to Edward Trickett in 24m.35s. After an even start Trickett took a three lengths lead, which Sadler was unable to recover. This was the first Championship race rowed on sliding seats.(see Harry Clasper (section Sliding seats)). The race became known as the World Championship at this point as Trickett was the first non-British contestant to win. Sadler was reported to have retired after this race but he must have continued some later training. On 5 November 1877 he and Harry Kelley, his old foe, raced over the Putney to Mortlake course for a stake of \u00a3400. After an even start Sadler went ahead and was never passed. His time was 24m.02s. After the race Kelley rowed over to Sadler and shook hands to the cheers of the onlookers."]}, {"page": "James Messenger", "response": ["A vast crowd was on hand to watch the race between Messenger and Harry Kelley on 12 May 1857. Every public vantage point along the Putney and Fulham to Mortlake and Chiswick course was taken up by spectators. Messenger rowed in a boat of his own construction and was piloted by Thomas MacKinney who had in 1851 been contender for the title, losing to Robert Coombes."]}, {"page": "Charles A. Messenger", "response": ["His father James was a noted sculler and boat builder who in 1854 won the World Sculling Championship from Tom Cole (rower). James held the title for four years until beaten by the well known sculler Harry Kelley."]}, {"page": "Michael Rush (rower)", "response": ["Rush was soundly beaten, Trickett winning by several lengths. A combination of factors led to Rush's defeat. Trickett had won a World Championship, at an international venue, and he brought home to Australia the polish and self-confidence that arose from this experience. Trickett trained on the Thames, the home of championship sculling, by expert coaches including Harry Kelley.Trickett, G. Chapter 5 Rush, though trained by the ex-champion Richard Green, remained in effect an amateur, largely self-taught. Rush invented his own sculling technique, based on sheer strength and endurance; his style was often deprecated. and Trickett was three inches taller than Rush, and had a longer reach.However, World Champion sculler Ned Hanlan showed that skill rather than superior physique was the deciding factor for a winning oarsman. Finally, Trickett learned on the Thames to use racing-craft fitted with a sliding seat, which allowed a more efficient use of the sculler's whole body when rowing. Before the race, Rush tried a sliding seat racing-shell, but could not discover any advantage, and chose instead to row a fixed-seat outrigger. Once the news of Rush's decision became public, betting odds changed dramatically, favouring Trickett, and the result of the race was considered almost a foregone conclusion. Still, Rush was known as an honest sportsman and was expected to put up a mighty effort to beat Trickett. And so he did, but without success."]}, {"page": "Harry Kelley", "response": ["*Harry Kelley (rower) (1832\u20131914), British oarsman on the Thames", "*Harry Kelley (baseball) (1906\u20131958), Major League Baseball pitcher"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham", "response": ["* Harry Kelley, professional oarsman, born and died in Fulham."]}]}}
