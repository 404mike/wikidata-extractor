His book AD 43, published by Tempus in 2002, is the first to give serious consideration to the archaeological evidence for the Roman invasion of Britain having taken place via alternative routes (as opposed to the traditional view of Richborough in Kent as the main landing-place).Manley was educated at the universities of Manchester and Sussex, and has excavated throughout Europe, as well as in the Near East, Africa and the Caribbean. He was formerly County Archaeologist of Clwyd and Chief Executive of the Sussex Archaeological Society. He is currently an Hon.

The port of departure is usually taken to have been Boulogne (), and the main landing at Rutupiae (Richborough, on the east coast of Kent). Neither of these locations is certain. Dio does not mention the port of departure, and although Suetonius says that the secondary force under Claudius sailed from Boulogne,Suetonius, Claudius 17 it does not necessarily follow that the entire invasion force did. Richborough has a large natural harbour which would have been suitable, and archaeology shows Roman military occupation at about the right time. However, Dio says the Romans sailed east to west, and a journey from Boulogne to Richborough is south to north.

For instance, from 1995 to 1999, archeologists John Manley and David Rudkin conducted digs that focused on southern portions of the site, which exposed significant evidence of human activity prior to the Roman conquest in 43 AD. \u00a0Over the course of five years, Manley\u2019s team of archeologists discovered nearly twelve thousand artifacts, including flint tools that are believed to date back to the Mesolithic period (around 5000-4000 BC) and could indicate the presence of a hunter and gatherer settlement near the present-day location of the Fishbourne palace. However, the most intriguing and significant evidence of pre-Roman human activity at the site comes from a ditch containing nearly seven hundred fragments of pottery and a cup that can be traced back to a period within the Late Iron Age. The findings made by Manley and his team challenge Cunliffe\u2019s earlier assumptions by suggesting the likely presence of significant human activity at Fishbourne prior to 43 AD."]}, {"page": "John Manley (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Manley (born 1950) is a Canadian politician.", "John Manley may also refer to:", "*John Manley (MP) (1622\u20131699), English soldier, MP and Postmaster General", "*John Manley (archaeologist) (born 1950), British archaeologist", "*John Manley (naval officer) (1733\u20131793), United States Navy officer"]}, {"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*John Manley (born 1952) British; Roman Britain"]}, {"page": "Peter Drewett", "response": ["Peter Ladson Drewett (1947 \u2013 1 April 2013) was an English archaeologist and academic, best known for his work in Sussex.John Manley, \"Peter Ladson Drewett 1947\u20132013\", Sussex Past & Present, August 2013, p.11"]}]}}
