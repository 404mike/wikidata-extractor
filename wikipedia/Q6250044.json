Born in Perth, he was the son of John Mylne, also a master mason, and Isobel Wilson.\nPractising as a stonemason, he also took on the role of architect, designing as well as building his projects. He was one of the last masters of Scottish Renaissance architecture, before new styles were imported by his successors. Alongside his professional career, he also served as a soldier and politician. He married three times but had no surviving children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Giles' Cathedral", "response": ["On visiting the church prior to the Burn restoration, Thomas Rickman wrote: \"... a few of the windows have the tracery remaining, but from most of them it has been cut away.\"Rickman in Lees 1889, p. 261. Views of the church before the Burn restoration show intersecting tracery in some of the choir windows and looping patterns in the windows of the Holy Blood Aisle.Fawcett 1994, p. 189. Burn retained the tracery of the great east window, which had been restored by John Mylne the Younger in the mid-17th century. In the other windows Burn inserted new tracery based on late medieval Scottish examples.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 107.Marshall 2009, pp. 114-115.", "For the arrival into Edinburgh of Anne of Denmark in 1590, 21 weather vanes were added to the crests of the steeple; these were removed prior to 1800 and replacements were installed in 2005.Marshall 2009, pp. 72, 189. The steeple was repaired by John Mylne the Younger in 1648. Mylne added pinnacles half-way up the crests of the buttresses; he is also largely responsible for the present appearance of the central pinnacle and may have rebuilt the tower's traceried parapet.Hay 1976, p. 252. The weathercock atop the central pinnacle was created by Alexander Anderson in 1667; it replaced an earlier weathercock of 1567 by Alexander Honeyman.Marshall 2009, pp. 66, 97."]}, {"page": "John Mylne (1611-1667)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Mylne (died 1667)"]}, {"page": "John Mylne (1611\u20131667)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Mylne (died 1667)"]}]}}
