He also plays guitar, melodica and piano. His main influences are Kraftwerk, hip-hop, Can, various electro bands and Crass. Despite being a self-confessed dance music fan, he also admits to liking heavy rock bands such as Marilyn Manson.\nThe strange noises produced by Griffiths' piano(contrary to rumours, he does not use a Theremin) are one of the trademarks of Space's sound. Unlike his other bandmates, Griffiths has never performed lead vocals on a Space track, with one exception \u2013 \"I Am Unlike A Lifeform You've Ever Met\", a B-side on the \"Avenging Angels\" single. However, on the first two Space albums, Spiders and Tin Planet, as well as the B-sides of various singles, he has contributed instrumental tracks, as well as remixes under the moniker Franny Aspirin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Space (English band)", "response": ["Space are a British band from Liverpool, who formed in 1992 initially as a trio of Tommy Scott (vocals, bass, guitar), Jamie Murphy (vocals, guitar) and Jamie Island (drums), who was later replaced by Andy Parle. Keyboard player Franny Griffiths joined the line-up a year later, and the band rose to prominence throughout the mid-1990s with hit singles such as \"Female of the Species\", \"Me and You Versus the World\", \"Neighbourhood\", \"Avenging Angels\" and \"The Ballad of Tom Jones\", the latter a duet with Cerys Matthews of Catatonia.", "Tommy Scott (then bass player) and Jamie Murphy formed The Substitutes in 1992 and aimed for a Who-influenced sound. The band would later rename themselves Space after the working title for the song \"My Own Dream\" by The Real People. Jamie Island was briefly the band's drummer before being replaced by Andy Parle, and they released a 12-inch single entitled \"If Its' Real\". Franny Griffiths, an old friend and former member of Scott's earlier group Hello Sunset, was brought in to join them on keyboards and electronics a year later, establishing their trademark style. The band secured a recording contract with Gut Records, who released their first single, \"Money\", in 1995. The single \"Neighbourhood\"' followed in 1996, but it was not until the release of their next single, \"Female of the Species\", that they achieved popular acclaim. This song was also the theme song to the UK television series Cold Feet.", "Since the band's original break-up, most of the former members have continued to play in bands and music industry: Scott, along with Phil Hartley, a former live technician for the group, formed a punk band called the Drellas, which in its final incarnation included Allan Jones on drums and Ryan Clarke on vintage keys. Hartley, who plays bass, also produces for the band, along with other Antipop Records acts such as Metro Manila Aide, The Dead Class, The Temps and Fraktures. Franny Griffiths was with Murphy and Vinnie Camilleri (who played guitar for The Beatles Pre- Ringo drummer Pete Best) with their band Dust, and also making R&B under the name Subway Showdown, while Yorkie is producing for Shack. Franny also co-writes & produces with Vinnie Camilleri for Spaceman V Man.", "* Franny Griffiths \u2013 keyboards, synthesizers, melodica, sonic manipulations, backing vocals (1994-2005, 2011\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Tin Planet", "response": ["Recorded in late 1997 following a tumultuous year for the group, Tin Planet was a continuation of the eclectic blend of musical styles explored on their debut album Spiders. However, it was noted that the more abrasive aspects of their sound were toned down considerably from their debut, with the songs being more melodic with a prominent cabaret and easy listening influence. Keyboardist Franny Griffiths' love of techno and electronic music was also brought to the fore, culminating in three tracks that were primarily dance-orientated.", "In 1996, Space released their debut album Spiders on Gut Records. Combining surreal, darkly humorous lyrics and a large number of styles and genres, including rock, techno, hip hop and funk, a result of the different musical tastes of the band members, the album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and becoming certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in December 1996 for sales of over 300,000. Nonetheless, in mid-1997, during their tour of the United States, where the band began to find minor success, numerous personal problems hit the band. The band were constantly under stress, which reached such an extent that keyboardist Franny Griffiths developed an ulcer, lyricist and vocalist Tommy Scott lost his voice and the band's guitarist and other lyricist and vocalist, Jamie Murphy, \"still only 21, simply lost it completely and had a spell in psychiatric care being fed anti-depressants and milk.\""]}, {"page": "Spiders (album)", "response": ["Whilst on tour, the band discovered the music of hip-hop group Cypress Hill, and quickly became attracted to their bass-driven grooves and use of sampling. Soon after, they decided to recruit Scott's friend and former bandmember in Hello Sunset, Franny Griffiths, who at the time was living and working at a nightclub in Ibiza, in joining the band on keyboards and electronics, establishing the band's trademark, multi-genre style. Although Griffiths was unimpressed by the demo tape that they had sent him, he agreed to join them on the condition that they start writing better material. Early versions of \"Mister Psycho\", \"Kill Me\", \"Neighbourhood\", \"Money\" and \"Spiders\" were amongst the songs the band demoed under the new line-up, and were recorded in their friend David \"Yorkie\" Palmer's bedroom. According to Griffiths, he had to sell off his car in order to purchase his first sampler. Successful indie label Gut Records (who previously had chart hits with Right Said Fred on their sub-label Tug) paid attention to the band as they had started initiated a sub-label that was also named Hug Records, asking Mark Cowley for permission to release music with the same company name.", "The album's combining of rock and electronic elements has been described as \"a marriage in perfect harmony\" where \"the guitars don't lead and the beats don't overpower.\" The Daily Trojan described the balance as follows: \"The album smoothly flows from song to song with underlying guitars that accent the friendly techno beats provided by keyboard player Franny Griffiths. The effect is one that gives each song a distinct atmosphere while seldom giving away too much control to either techno or rock. Electronic blips are not overused and show up only to give songs more character.\" There are also found sound elements to the album; Parle explained: \"When we were in Hong Kong, we heard these children saying prayers, it was like a mad wailing sound. Straight away we got out a dictaphone and started taping it. If something's going to make a track sound better we'll use it. As long as it's not contrived.\"", "* Franny Griffiths - Keyboards, synthesizers, sonic manipulations"]}, {"page": "Suburban Rock 'n' Roll", "response": ["For this album Space sought to diverge from the lush, elaborate pop sound of their two previous albums, Tin Planet and Love You More than Football, by embracing a more stripped back, sample-driven style. Tommy Scott's lyrical themes also shifted in direction, moving away from the character-driven lyrics of old to more personal reflections, with songs dealing with death, living in suburbia, crime and surveillance. The band also reunited with producer Stephen Lironi, who produced their debut album Spiders, and is credited as songwriter of a few tracks. Suburban Rock 'N' Roll is the first Space album with no techno/electronic instrumentals from Franny Griffiths, as the band wanted the album to be more song-oriented.", "Keyboardist Franny Griffiths defended the album's lack of dance tracks, which had been somewhat of a tradition on previous Space releases: \"For me it's better. People might say why's there no dance tracks or maybe there's no Yorkie tracks, but I think when you listen back to it you'll see why them things aren't on it because its more consistent, even though it's all our different ideas, it's at a better blend, it runs better and you can listen to each track after each other no problem. You're not jumping from one track to another, you want to actually listen to it from start to finish.\"", "* Franny Griffiths \u2013 keyboards, electronics, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Female of the Species", "response": ["Written and sung by frontman Tommy Scott in tribute to his late father, who reportedly disliked his son's taste of music, \"Female of the Species\" is a funky, upbeat, Latin-flavoured number with feel-good-sounding vibes and vocals, reminiscent of lounge singers such as Perry Como and Frank Sinatra, combined with keyboardist Franny Griffiths' trademark sound effects and Scott's darkly humorous lyrics. The song borrows to some extent, both thematically and in overall aesthetic, from The Walker Brothers' theme song for the 1967 film Deadlier Than the Male.
