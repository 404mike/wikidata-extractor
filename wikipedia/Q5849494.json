Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process.Hibbert, pp. 503\u2013504; St Aubyn, p. 30; Woodham-Smith, pp. 88, 436\u2013437 Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist.

Alexandra showed devotion to her children: \"She was in her glory when she could run up to the nursery, put on a flannel apron, wash the children herself and see them asleep in their little beds.\"Mrs. Blackburn, the head nurse, quoted in Duff, p. 115. Albert Edward and Alexandra had six children in total: Albert Victor, George, Louise, Victoria, Maud, and Alexander. All of Alexandra's children were apparently born prematurely; biographer Richard Hough thought Alexandra deliberately misled Queen Victoria as to her probable delivery dates, as she did not want the queen to be present at their births.Hough, p. 116. During the birth of her third child in 1867, the added complication of a bout of rheumatic fever threatened Alexandra's life, and left her with a permanent limp.Battiscombe, pp. 82\u201386, and Duff, pp. 73, 81."]}, {"page": "Sports car racing", "response": ["According to historian Richard Hough, \"It is obviously impossible to distinguish between the designers of sports cars and Grand Prix machines during the pre-1914 period. The late Georges Faroux contended that sports-car racing was not born until the first 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1923, and while as a joint-creator of that race he may have been prejudiced in his opinion, it is certainly true that sports-car racing as it was known after 1919 did not exist before the First World War.\""]}, {"page": "Mutiny on the Bounty", "response": ["From February onwards, the pace of work increased; more than 1,000 breadfruit plants were potted and carried into the ship, where they filled the great cabin. The ship was overhauled for the long homeward voyage, in many cases by men who regretted the forthcoming departure and loss of their easy life with the Tahitians. Bligh was impatient to be away, but as Richard Hough observes in his account, he \"failed to anticipate how his company would react to the severity and austerity of life at sea\u00a0... after five dissolute, hedonistic months at Tahiti\". The work was done by 1 April 1789, and four days later, after an affectionate farewell from Tynah and his queen, Bounty left the harbour.", "Among historians' attempts to portray Bligh more sympathetically are those of Richard Hough (1972) and Caroline Alexander (2003). Hough depicts \"an unsurpassed foul-weather commander ... I would go through hell and high water with him, but not for one day in the same ship on a calm sea\". Alexander presents Bligh as over-anxious, solicitous of his crew's well-being, and utterly devoted to his task. However, Bligh's reputation as the archetypal bad commander remains: the Baltimore Sun reviewer of Alexander's book wrote \"poetry routed science and it has held the field ever since\"."]}, {"page": "David Lean", "response": ["From 1977 until 1980, Lean and Robert Bolt worked on a film adaptation of Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian, a dramatized account by Richard Hough of the Mutiny on the Bounty. It was originally to be released as a two-part film, one named The Lawbreakers that dealt with the voyage out to Tahiti and the subsequent mutiny, and the second named The Long Arm that studied the journey of the mutineers after the mutiny as well as the admiralty's response in sending out the frigate HMS Pandora, in which some of the mutineers were imprisoned. Lean could not find financial backing for both films after Warner Bros. withdrew from the project; he decided to combine it into one and looked at a seven-part TV series before getting backing from Italian mogul Dino De Laurentiis. The project then suffered a further setback when Bolt suffered a serious stroke and was unable to continue writing; the director felt that Bolt's involvement would be crucial to the film's success. Melvyn Bragg ended up writing a considerable portion of the script."]}, {"page": "Hialeah, Florida", "response": ["* Richard Hough, former professional baseball player, Hialeah High graduate"]}, {"page": "The Bounty (1984 film)", "response": ["The screenplay by Robert Bolt was based on the book Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian (1972) by Richard Hough.

His big black eyes are full of spirit and vivacity.\"Grey, p. 35. Biographer Richard Hough writes that \"even from their infancy, it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father, in character and appearance, while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects.\"Hough, p. 9.

Thompson receives a letter from the editor of Running magazine, asking him to cover the 1980 Honolulu Marathon, which the editor says should be \"a good chance for a vacation\". Thompson asks the illustrator Ralph Steadman to accompany him. On the flight over, he meets a man named Ackerman, who seems to have connections to the drug trade in Hawaii. Thompson covers the marathon with his characteristic gonzo style, weaving his own experiences into the coverage of the story. After the marathon, Thompson along with Steadman and his family move to a rented beach side compound on Hawaii's Kona coast. The weather is miserable and they are trapped indoors, besieged by huge waves. Steadman and his family, upset about the terrible conditions of their vacation, return to England. Later, Thompson reunites with Ackerman to go fishing. Thompson eventually catches a huge Marlin, which he beats to death with a Samoan war club. The fishing boat returns to the dock, with Thompson screaming triumphantly, \"I am Lono!\", referring to the ancient Hawaiian god which upsets the locals, and he goes into hiding in the City of Refuge. The story frequently breaks away to excerpts from The Last Voyage of Captain James Cook by Richard Hough, which tells the story of the man the native Hawaiians thought was the reincarnation of Lono and was eventually killed by them when he overstayed his welcome on the island of Hawaii."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Richard Hough, writer on maritime history, was born in Brighton "]}, {"page": "British Empire in fiction", "response": ["* Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian (1972) by Richard Hough is a novel describing the events on the Bounty in 1789."]}, {"page": "Reader's Digest Condensed Books", "response": ["* Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian - Richard Hough"]}, {"page": "Richard R.
