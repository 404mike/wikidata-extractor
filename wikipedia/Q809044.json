However, the popularity of the game in Asia, with emerging talents such as Liang Wenbo and more established players such as Ding Junhui and Marco Fu, boosted the sport in the Far East. By 2007, the BBC dedicated 400 hours to snooker coverage, compared to just 14 minutes 40 years earlier. In 2010, promoter Barry Hearn gained a controlling interest in the World Snooker Tour, pledging to revitalise the \"moribund\" professional game. Since then, the number of professional tournaments has increased, with 44 events held in the 2019\u201320 season. Snooker tournaments have been adapted to make them more suitable for television audiences, with some tournaments being played over a shortened duration, or the Snooker Shoot Out, which is a timed, one- competition. The prize money for professional events has increased as the sport continues to grow, with the top players earning several million pounds over the course of their careers.

The shot-timed Premier League Snooker was established, with seven players invited to compete at regular United Kingdom venues, televised on Sky Sports. Players had twenty-five seconds to take each shot, with five time-outs per player per match. Although some success was achieved with this format, it generally did not receive the same amount of press attention or status as the regular ranking tournaments. This event has been taken out of the tour since 2013, when the Champion of Champions was established. The event saw players qualify by virtue of winning other events in the season, with 16 champions competing. Reflecting the game's aristocratic origins, the majority of tournaments on the professional circuit require players to wear waistcoats and bow ties. The necessity for this rule has been questioned, and players such as Stephen Maguire have been granted medical exemptions from wearing a bow tie."]}, {"page": "Cockney", "response": ["*Barry Hearn, sporting events promoter, born in Dagenham"]}, {"page": "ITV (TV network)", "response": ["**Snooker is another sport which ITV dropped but has subsequently restarted to show.

Notwithstanding that finance for the redevelopment had already been raised by selling off the four corners of the stadium for residential blocks of flats, an increase in costs meant that an emergency general meeting of the company was needed in April 2005. It was agreed that the club should sell a c.999-year lease on the West Stand for \u00a31.5\u00a0million to a consortium led by Barry Hearn (under the company name Samuel Beadie (Leyton) Ltd or SBLL), with SBLL leasing back to the club on a same-length lease all of the stand except the office space for an annual rent of \u00a31.
