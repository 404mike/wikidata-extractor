Variety's Brian Lowry commented, \"this latest Sense & Sensibility has done a splendid job casting its various roles, despite an inevitable wattage deficit compared with the most recent theatrical version. Davies and director John Alexander have also taken some liberties by crafting scenes of the men together (something Austen herself never did) \u2013 having the steely Brandon, for example, pull Willoughby aside to question his intentions toward Marianne.
