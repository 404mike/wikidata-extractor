The film had actually been made in 1949 but was not released until 1952. The role was the most physically demanding of her career, doing her own stunts and training in the art of fencing for six weeks under  Belgian-born fencing master Fred Cavens.  She disliked director Lewis Allen and producer Howard Hughes, whom she thought was \"cold as ice\". The critic from The New York Times appreciated O'Hara's swordsmanship in the film, stating that she was \"snarling like a Fury, impales her opponents as though she were threading a needle.\" O'Hara next played Irish immigrant Australian-based cowgirl, Dell McGuire, in Lewis Milestone's drama Kangaroo (1952), set during the drought of 1900. Kangaroo is noted for being the first Technicolor film to be shot on location in Australia, mostly shot in the desert near Port Augusta. Although O'Hara disliked the production, she found the Australians extremely welcoming. The Australian government offered her a plot of land during the production to own permanently, but she turned it down for political reasons, only to later discover that  significant oil reserves were on the land."]}, {"page": "John Houseman", "response": ["|Lewis Allen"]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Lewis Allen"]}, {"page": "Lewis Allen", "response": ["Lewis Allen or Lewis Allan may refer to:", ";Lewis Allen", "*Lewis Allen (rugby union) (1870\u20131932), New Zealand rugby union player", "*Frederick Lewis Allen (1890\u20131954), American editor and historian", "*Lewis Allen (director) (1905\u20132000), film and television director", "*Lewis Allan (sometimes misspelled Lewis Allen), pseudonym of Abel Meeropol (1903\u20131986), American lyricist"]}, {"page": "Donald Crisp", "response": ["A versatile supporting actor, Crisp could be equally good in lovable or sinister roles.

The film is based on Dorothy Macardle's novel Uneasy Freehold (1941), which was published in the United States as The Uninvited (1942) and deals with a brother and sister who purchase a house in Cornwall, England, that is plagued by paranormal events. The film is part of a cycle of supernatural-themed films that began appearing in the mid-1940s. Dodie Smith began writing the film, and Frank Partos was brought in by his friend, associate producer Charles Brackett. Brackett wanted to have the film directed by Alfred Hitchcock but could not organize plans with him, so Allen directed it. Filming began on April 16, 1943; Allen found working with Gail Russell, who was inexperienced and began crying several times, to be the most difficult part of filming.", "Lewis Allen worked in both West End and Broadway theater for Gilbert Miller, and was connected with agent Louis Shurr, who connected him with Buddy DeSylva, an executive at  Paramount Pictures. DeSylva had seen a play adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that Allen had directed and offered him work at Paramount. According to Allen, he had about six months of apprenticeship, initially at Paramount, working with directors including Preston Sturges and Mark Sandrich. During this period, Allen became friends with Brackett. By January 18, Allen had been reading the script of The Uninvited for DeSylva and noted the film's slow pace. By January 21, they had worked on a faster-paced and lighter introduction. By January 29, De Sylva had contacted Brackett, stating he wanted The Uninvited to be produced in March. On February 6, Brackett asked Allen to direct The Uninvited; It would be the first film Lewis Allen would direct. Brackett continue working on the script for The Uninvited and completed it on February 20. On March 2, Brackett read the script to Smith, who approved it. Brackett commented Smith was \"afraid of the job of writing out scenes skeletonized by Frank [Partos], but is going over our first sequences seeing if she can approve them and if so going to work\".", "Critics also praised the cast, with many singling out Gail Russell. According to Whittaker, \"the picture belongs to a 20-year-old Gail Russell\" who \"creates a most favorable impression. There's a sort of dewy charm to Miss Russell that is as unusual on the screen as it is appealing.\" Krug also praised Russell as \"a revelation among the newcomers\" and said: \"This youngster can do something beside pose as she radiates the terror that besets her.\" Rowen said Russell is \"beautiful and talented, will no doubt be heard from in future Paramount pictures\". Martin noted \"fine direction by Lewis Allen\" and praised the cast\u00a0\u2013 specifically Crisp, Milland, Hussey, Skiner, Napier and Russell\u00a0\u2013 who make the film \"a drama rich in suspense\". A review in the Monthly Film Bulletin found the film very good technically, with \"some beautiful coastal scenery\" and attempts at reconstructing a seaside village, as well as \"beautiful interiors\" of the house. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times also commented on the cast, saying that Milland and Hussey \"do nicely as the couple who get themselves involved, being sufficiently humorous in spots to seem plausibly real\" and that Russell is \"wistful and gracious as a curiously moonstruck girl\".  Crowther commented on some plot elements, noting that the intellectual aspects of the story \"had better be left unquestioned\" because of \"glaring confusion in the wherefore and why of what goes on\" and that the back-stories of the ghosts are not explained.", "Category:Films directed by Lewis Allen"]}, {"page": "List of British film directors", "response": ["*Lewis Allen"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1944", "response": ["|Our Hearts Were Young and Gay || Lewis Allen || Gail Russell, Diana Lynn || Comedy || Paramount ", "|The Uninvited||Lewis Allen ||Ray Milland, Ruth Hussey, Donald Crisp || Horror||Paramount"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1945", "response": ["| Those Endearing Young Charms || Lewis Allen || Robert Young, Laraine Day || Comedy || RKO", "| The Unseen || Lewis Allen || Gail Russell, Joel McCrea || Thriller || Paramount"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1947", "response": ["|Desert Fury|| Lewis Allen || John Hodiak, Lizabeth Scott, Burt Lancaster ||Film noir || Paramount", "|The Imperfect Lady||Lewis Allen||Ray Milland, Teresa Wright|| Drama|| Paramount", "|The Perfect Marriage || Lewis Allen || Loretta Young, David Niven, Virginia Field || Comedy || Paramount"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1948", "response": ["|Sealed Verdict || Lewis Allen || Ray Milland, Florence Marly, Broderick Crawford || Drama || Paramount", "|So Evil My Love || Lewis Allen || Ray Milland, Geraldine Fitzgerald || Drama || Paramount"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1949", "response": ["|Chicago Deadline || Lewis Allen || Alan Ladd, Donna Reed, June Havoc || Film Noir || Paramount"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1951", "response": ["|Appointment with Danger|| Lewis Allen || Alan Ladd, Phyllis Calvert || Film noir || Paramount", "|Valentino||Lewis Allen ||Eleanor Parker, Anthony Dexter || Adventure || Columbia"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1952", "response": ["|At Sword's Point|| Lewis Allen || Cornel Wilde, Maureen O'Hara, Gladys Cooper || Adventure || RKO"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1954", "response": ["|Suddenly||Lewis Allen ||Frank Sinatra, Sterling Hayden, Nancy Gates || Crime drama || United Artists"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1958", "response": ["|Another Time, Another Place|| Lewis Allen ||Lana Turner, Barry Sullivan, Sean Connery, Glynis Johns || Melodrama||Paramount"]}, {"page": "Freedom Comes High", "response": ["Freedom Comes High is a 1944 dramatic short film commissioned by the United States Government during World War II and directed by Lewis Allen.", "Category:Films directed by Lewis Allen"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1955", "response": ["| A Bullet for Joey || Lewis Allen || Edward G.
