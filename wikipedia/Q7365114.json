He is chiefly remembered for his wartime research into rosehips as a source of vitamin C, prompted by the epidemic of scurvy amongst children owing to the reduced importation of fresh fruit. His research concluded that hips from the common Dog Rose Rosa canina held the highest concentration of the vitamin. In later years, he challenged the two-species taxonomy of the British elms proposed by Richens, identifying five distinct species, several varieties and numerous complex hybrids.Melville also compiled the world's first Red Data Book, published in 1970, listing all known threatened plants. He was made a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1938. The tree Acacia melvillei is named in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Goodyer", "response": ["Goodyer added many plants to the British flora. He is credited with clarifying the identities of the British elms, and for discovering an unusual elm endemic to the Hampshire coast between Lymington and Christchurch named for him as Goodyer's elm; this was believed by the botanist Ronald Melville to be a form of the Cornish elm. He is also believed to have introduced the Jerusalem artichoke to English cuisine. Although not formally trained in medicine, like many herbalists of his time, he had a small practice using herbal remedies, skills he passed on to his nephew, Rev. Edmund Yalden."]}, {"page": "Melville (name)", "response": ["*Ronald Melville (1903\u20131985), English botanist"]}, {"page": "Ulmus minor 'Plotii'", "response": ["The Field Elm cultivar Ulmus minor 'Plotii', commonly known as Lock Elm or Lock's Elm (its vernacular names), Plot's Elm or Plot Elm, and first classified as Ulmus sativa Mill. var.

Ronald Melville suggested that the tree's distribution may be related to river valley systems, in particular those of the Trent, Witham, Welland, and Nene. Two further populations existed in Gloucestershire.
