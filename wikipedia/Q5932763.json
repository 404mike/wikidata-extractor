While Caine was very young he became well known and highly regarded by the people of south Liverpool. There he was in great demand as a speaker, having the ability to engage an audience from his first word. Through studying the works of the Lake School of Poets, and the best writers of the eighteenth century, Caine combined this knowledge with his own ideas of perfection, and went on to develop his level of eloquence to oratory."]}, {"page": "Thomas Edward Brown", "response": ["Brown was born on 5 May 1830 at Douglas, Isle of Man, the sixth of ten children born to Rev.

(In the short story 'The Dead' from Dubliners, Joyce has a version that goes, \"For they are jolly gay fellows...\" with a refrain between verses of \"Unless he tells a lie\".) The 1935 American film Ruggles of Red Gap, set in rural Washington State, ends with repeated choruses of the song, with the two variations sung alternately. That may have been chosen by the writer or director because, although the singing crowd is almost completely American, they are singing it about a British person."]}, {"page": "Hope Street, Liverpool", "response": ["*Statue of Hugh Stowell Brown"]}, {"page": "West Derby Cemetery", "response": ["* Hugh Stowell Brown"]}, {"page": "List of Baptists", "response": ["*Hugh Stowell Brown (1823\u20131886, IoM), preacher and activist"]}, {"page": "Peace Society", "response": ["*Hugh Stowell Brown - leader of the Liverpool branch"]}, {"page": "Hugh Brown", "response": ["* Hugh Stowell Brown (1823\u20131886), Christian minister and preacher"]}, {"page": "John Roberts, 1st Baron Clwyd", "response": ["Lord Clwyd married Hannah, daughter of William Sproston Caine and granddaughter of Hugh Stowell Brown, in 1893.
