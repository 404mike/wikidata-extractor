He was also the first Sussex cricketer to take a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket.The son of Sussex off spinner Fred Tate and nicknamed \"Chubby\", Maurice began his career for Sussex as a hard-hitting batsman and spin bowler with one match in 1912. He played a few matches in 1913 and 1914, but established himself as a batsman in 1919 by scoring over a thousand runs for the first of eleven consecutive seasons. In the following two years, Tate's batting developed further with a double hundred against Northamptonshire in 1921 representing his highest first-class score. However, his bowling remained secondary throughout this period.In 1922 Tate had, aided by some very poor batting sides, enjoyed more success as a bowler than in previous years. However, in a famous incident at practice with his captain Arthur Gilligan, he bowled a faster ball, and it scattered the stumps.\nThis led to the famous quote \"Maurice, you must change your style of bowling immediately\". From then on Tate developed as a tireless fast-medium bowler and the founder of modern seam bowling. Though not exceptionally fast through the air, Tate gave the illusion of gaining speed off the pitch. His easy, rhythmic action and solid build allowed him to do a great amount of bowling \u2013 his bowling of 9567 deliveries in 1925 is unparalleled among bowlers of medium pace or above, this when he was still opening the batting for Sussex in many matches.\nFrom 1923 to 1925, Tate had great success, not only in county cricket, but also in Test matches. In each of those years he took over 200 wickets, but his batting did not suffer even though Sussex were very weak in this department and though bowling support from Gilligan largely disappeared after 1924 due to a serious injury.\nIn 1924, on his Test debut, he and Gilligan dismissed South Africa for 30 in just 12.3 overs in the first innings of the First Test, played at Edgbaston. He took 4/12 with Gilligan taking 6/7. Moreover, when he toured Australia in 1924-5, on pitches which had proved too much for all English bowlers since Sydney Barnes and Frank Foster in 1911/1912, Tate took 38 wickets (average 23.18) and got through over 600 balls in three of the five Tests with almost no useful bowling support. It is still the record number of wickets by an Englishman in an Ashes series in Australia.\nIn the following six years, Tate's grand all-round service to Sussex and England continued, with his batting reaching a peak in 1927, when he hit five centuries for Sussex. In 1929, Tate hit his only Test century against South Africa, but from 1930, whilst he remained a force as a bowler, his batting declined severely and he began to go in very late in the order. The storm created by Don Bradman that year did not pass Tate. From that time, with exceptionally fast bowlers such as Harold Larwood and Bill Voce available, Tate was no longer an essential member of the England side, though he was still a match-winner for Sussex with 164 wickets in 1932. On his third tour of Australia, he did not play a Test match, and even with Larwood unavailable in 1934, Tate (though still bowling superbly for Sussex) was not chosen for any Test.\nIn 1936, Tate's bowling waned, except for 7 for 19 against Hampshire, he was much more expensive than before, and after 1937, when he had been in and out of the first eleven, Sussex chose not to retain Tate any longer, but he continued to be a keen observer of the game until his death.\nTate continues to hold the record for the most wickets in a season outside England (116 in 1926\u20137 in India/Ceylon, average 13.78; he also scored 1,193 runs in that season and is the only man to do a 'double' outside England). He achieved the exceptional double of 1,000 runs and 200 wickets in a season three years running (1923, 1924 and 1925). His career total of 2,784 wickets (average 18.16) is the 11th highest ever, and with 21,717 runs (average 25.01) he is one of only nine people ever to get a career double of 20,000 runs and 2,000 wickets. He took three hat tricks in his career. He was Wisden Cricketer of the year in 1924. Also Tate was one of the fastest scorers in Test cricket history.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 18", "response": ["*1956 \u2013 Maurice Tate, English cricketer (b. 1895)"]}, {"page": "May 30", "response": ["*1895 \u2013 Maurice Tate, English cricketer (d. 1956)"]}, {"page": "1920s", "response": ["* Maurice Tate (Sussex and England cricketer)"]}, {"page": "1956", "response": ["* May 18 \u2013 Maurice Tate, English cricketer (b. 1895)"]}, {"page": "1924 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Maurice Tate 205 @ 13.74 (BB 8\u201318)"]}, {"page": "1923 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Maurice Tate 219 @ 13.97 (BB 8\u201330)", "* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Arthur Gilligan, Roy Kilner, George Macaulay, Cec Parkin, Maurice Tate"]}, {"page": "1925 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Maurice Tate 228 @ 14.97 (BB 8\u201391)", "* Most wickets \u2013 Maurice Tate 77 @ 19.01 (BB 7\u201374)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Maurice Tate"]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["Jardine's batting performance in 1928 was similar to that from the previous season.

Swami finds that the board school has drill practices in the evening which is compulsory for every student. As a result he often gets late for the bowling practice. It annoys Rajam that he decides to talk to the headmaster of the Board School and to request him to allow Swami to escape the drill. Swami doesn't like the idea and tries to avoid this situation. But Rajam is adamant and he leads Swami to the headmaster\u2019s office. The headmaster flatly decline their request. The MCC schedules a cricket match against another local team YMU (Young Men's Union). Swami tells a physician named Dr. Kesavan about this problem. Dr. Kesavan agrees to convince his headmaster about this. Swami gets delighted and skips the drill practices. He continues to practice his cricketing skills with his friends. But to his bad luck, Dr. Kesavan doesn\u2019t talk about this issue to the headmaster. When the headmaster comes to know about Swami missing the drill practices, he threatens to beat him.

He briefly played county cricket for Surrey but moved to Sussex in 1920. Following a slow start to his county career, he rapidly improved and in partnership with Maurice Tate established a formidable bowling reputation. First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test captain in 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was at the height of his form when he suffered a blow to his heart while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924\u201325 season. The series was lost, but both he and his team were popular and respected. In following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex captain in 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex.", "During 1923, after returning to England, Gilligan had his best season in county cricket. He took 163 wickets at 17.50 and scored 1,183 runs at an average of 21.12 to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season for the only time in his career. With Maurice Tate, whose emergence as a pace bowler was encouraged by Gilligan,Lee, p. 150. he established a bowling partnership which proved effective over the following two seasons. Gilligan scored two centuries and nine times took five or more wickets in an innings. As a result of his performances, he was named as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation noted that he was now \"among the leading amateur cricketers of the day\", and was likely to play for England again. It concluded: \"It is not claimed for Arthur Gilligan, by even his warmest admirers, that he can be classed among great fast bowlers, but he is a very good one, combining with the right temperament and tireless energy just the extra bit of pace that to many batsmen is so distasteful.\""]}, {"page": "ICC Men's Player Rankings", "response": ["| 1929 || Herbert Sutcliffe ||  || Maurice Tate || ", "| 1928 || Herbert Sutcliffe ||  || Maurice Tate || ", "| 1927 || Jack Hobbs ||  || Maurice Tate || ", "| 1926 || Jack Hobbs ||  || Maurice Tate || ", "| 1925 || Jack Hobbs ||  || Maurice Tate || "]}, {"page": "List of International cricket families", "response": ["* Maurice Tate"]}, {"page": "Derek Shackleton", "response": ["Shackleton's high work rate reached new levels in the following years: he bowled over 9,000 balls in the dry summer of 1961, spearheading Hampshire's drive to their first County Championship win.

The English hoped that he would be the weapon to cut through Australia's strong batting line-up.Robinson, p. 213. Morris' assault ended Goddard's hopes of Test selection. His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the pitch of the ball, followed by decisive footwork. Morris confidently went out of his crease when the ball was of a full length and rocked onto the back foot to drive and cut if it was short. On many occasions, he hit Goddard on the full. Unable to contain Morris, Goddard packed the leg side field and bowled outside leg stump. Morris stepped down the wicket, repeatedly lofting the ball over the off side. Morris reached his century by lunch and was 231 by the tea interval.Robinson, p. 214. By the time he was dismissed, he had struck 40 fours and a six.Pollard, p. 12.

McCabe and Don Bradman were scoring quickly and had taken the score to 3/229 when McCabe lofted Maurice Tate towards mid-on. Syd Copley, a member of the ground staff who was acting as a substitute fielder dived forward and took a difficult catch. McCabe's dismissal sparked a collapse of 7/104 as England took a 93-run win.Harte and Whimpress,  p. 324. McCabe scored 44 and an unbeaten 25 as Australia squared the series with a seven-wicket triumph in the Second Test at Lords. McCabe made 30 in a rain-affected draw in the Third Test, before scoring four and taking 4/41 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, removing Ranjitsinhji, Maurice Leyland, Maurice Tate and Ian Peebles to reduce England to 8/251 in another wash out.Harte and Whimpress,  p. 326.

This made him the fifth highest run-scorer for the tour.Harte and Whimpress,  pp. 327\u2013328. However, he was unable to register a century on tour, his highest score being 96. He continued his habit of failing to convert his starts into centuries in the tour matches after the start of the Tests. In one stretch of eight county innings, he registered scores between 34 and 79 seven times, and he ended with seven fifties for the tour.
