In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the UK punk rock scene flourished, and reggae was a notable influence. The DJ Don Letts would play reggae and punk tracks at clubs such as The Roxy. Punk bands such as The Clash, The Ruts, The Members and The Slits played many reggae-influenced songs. Around the same time, reggae music took a new path in the UK; one that was created by the multiracial makeup of England's inner cities and exemplified by groups like Steel Pulse, Aswad and UB40, as well as artists such as Smiley Culture and Carroll Thompson. The Jamaican ghetto themes in the lyrics were replaced with UK inner city themes, and Jamaican patois became intermingled with Cockney slang. In South London around this time, a new subgenre of lovers rock, was being created. Unlike the Jamaican music of the same name which was mainly dominated by male artists such as Gregory Isaacs, the South London genre was led by female singers like Thompson and Janet Kay. The UK Lovers Rock had a softer and more commercial sound.Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include Third World, Black Uhuru and Sugar Minott.

It combined the smooth soul sounds of Chicago and Philadelphia soul with rocksteady and reggae bassline rhythms.[ \"Lovers Rock\"], allmusic.com, Macrovision CorporationBarrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) \"The Rough Guide to Reggae\", Rough Guides,  Rooted in the sound systems of South London, the style had particular appeal amongst women and produced many female stars including Carroll Thompson. Louisa Mark was aged 14 when she had a major lovers rock hit with her version of Robert Parker's \"Caught You in a Lie\" in 1975. This spawned the distinctive young girl female sound associated with early lovers rock. Simplicity formed in 1975 and released their first hit \"To Be in Love\" produced by Coxson; the B-side was the Emotions classic, \"A Feeling Is a Feeling\". They were headhunted by Neville King who produced their hits \"Loving Kind\", \"Waiting\" and \"Black Is Our Colour\". This was followed by the husband and wife production team of Dennis and Eve Harris who then had a big hit with T.T. Ross's \"Last Date\". Dennis Harris then set up a new record label, Lover's Rock, at his South East London Studio on Upper Brockley Road along with John Kpiaye and Dennis Bovell, which gave the new genre a name.", "According to sociologist Lisa Amanda Palmer, the patriarchal structures within Lover\u2019s Rock dictated female success as men were often the DJs and producers in that space. She cites the experience of Carroll Thompson, who created her own company (in which she maintained complete creative control of her projects) because she was tired of the sexist and prejudice attitudes within the industry. She also argues that these patriarchal structures are inherently harmful to both men and women. Pointedly, this gendering neglects the men who were allowed to be emotionally expressive and vulnerable within the context of Lover\u2019s Rocksuch as Beshara\u2019s 1981 track \u201cMen Cry Too\u201d which highlighted the emotions that consumed Black British men. Furthermore, this gendering creates a tension between political protest and the emotional/erotic. Additionally, it places femininity in opposition to Black political protest. The gendering of Black diasporic music is a commonplace, but Lover\u2019s Rock makes it clear that Black femininity is not inherently oppositional to Black power. Ultimately, Palmer asserts that Lover\u2019s Rock and Roots Reggae are not oppositional, but instead demonstrate the many forms of Black expression in a period of extreme racialization and prejudice."]}, {"page": "Letchworth", "response": ["* Carroll Thompson \u2013 lovers rock singer"]}, {"page": "Beshara (band)", "response": ["On 23 September 2011, as a tribute to Ray Watts, Tony Garfield performed as Beshara at the \"Giants of Lovers Rock Part 3\" concert at the indigO2 in London.
