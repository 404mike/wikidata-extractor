Described as \"the most photographed woman in Britain\" and \"arguably the first British supermodel\", she epitomised post-war glamour and modelled for both Dior and Balenciaga.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Model (person)", "response": ["With the development of fashion photography, the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, Barbara Goalen, Bettina Graziani and Lisa Fonssagrives began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 Vogue covers; her name recognition led to the importance of Vogue in shaping the careers of fashion models. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was Jinx Falkenburg who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time; through the 1950s, Wilhelmina Cooper, Jean Patchett, Dovima, Dorian Leigh, Suzy Parker, Evelyn Tripp and Carmen Dell'Orefice also dominated fashion. Dorothea Church was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris. However, these models were unknown outside the fashion community. Wilhelmina Cooper's measurements were 38\"-24\"-36\" whereas Chanel Iman's measurements are 32\"-23\"-33\". In 1946, Ford Models was established by Eileen and Gerard Ford in New York, making it one of the oldest model agencies in the world."]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Barbara Goalen, model (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "Bettina Graziani", "response": ["Bodin became one of the century's first supermodels, rivalled in the 1940s only by Barbara Goalen. She was associated with Lucien Lelong and Jacques Fath, but most importantly with Hubert de Givenchy, for whom she worked as a model and press agent. Givenchy named his first collection, which debuted in 1952, after her. One of his designs, the Byronesque \"Bettina blouse\", became a fashion icon in the early 1950s and inspired the bottle for the best-selling Givenchy perfume Amarige."]}, {"page": "Miss World 1958", "response": ["* Barbara Goalen \u2013 model"]}, {"page": "Elsbeth Juda", "response": ["Juda's shoots for The Ambassador combined elements of fashion, modernism and trade. Her series of photos of the famed British model Barbara Goalen modeling Scottish textiles among the heavy machinery of working textile factory are especially representative of her unique visual aesthetics.

She also made a white trapeze-line dress for Lady Antonia Fraser to wear to Royal Ascot in 1958, enabling her to be photographed while concealing her pregnancy. Although Byrne described her clothes as \"exclusive clothes \u2013 at reasonable prices\", Barbara Hulanicki, who went on to launch the original Biba boutique, remembered that one of Byrne's black dresses cost 20 guineas, which she thought quite expensive. Hulanicki would later recall how excited she and her friends were to discover Byrne designing the kind of nice, simple, youthful garments that they wanted to wear, but had difficulty finding."]}, {"page": "Otto Lucas", "response": ["Lucas was a skilled businessman and his workroom grew to immense proportions; a 1958 British Path\u00e9 film Heady Stuff \u2013 featuring a walk on role for top model Barbara Goalen \u2013 shows a small army of women working in the back of his Bond Street salon.
