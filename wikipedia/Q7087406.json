They also offer some comforting visions of life as it could be if we release the compassion that is in us all.\"In later life, Bernard converted to Roman Catholicism and lived in a small cottage in Kenninghall, Norfolk. In 1985 he spent several weeks in prison for his involvement in anti-nuclear civil disobedience action as part of the Snowball Campaign. He was married twice and had three children.
