He came from a famous family of actors and playwrights, his father being Dion Boucicault.\nAubrey Boucicault was born in London to Dion Boucicault and Agnes Robertson and was their sixth and youngest child. Aubrey's older siblings were Dion William (1855-1876), Eva (1857-1909), Dion Jr., Patrice (1862-?1890) and Nina. Aubrey's second wife was the actress Amy Busby (1872-1957), but they divorced after only a couple years of marriage. Busby filed divorce papers naming Victory Bateman as a co-respondent presumably in a case of adultery. He was later married to Cornelia Holbrook and then to Ruth Holt. He and Holbrook had a daughter Rene Boucicault.", "link_mentions": {}}}
