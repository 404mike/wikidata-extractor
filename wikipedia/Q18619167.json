The Conservative MP John Page complained that the programme was \"totally offensive and almost treasonable\".Valerie Adams, The Media and the Falklands Campaign (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1986), p. 9. Answering a question from Page on 6 May, Thatcher said that \"many people are very concerned indeed that the case for our British forces is not being put over fully and effectively. I understand that there are times when it seems that we and the Argentines are being treated almost as equals and almost on a neutral basis. I understand that there are occasions when some commentators will say that the Argentines did something and then \"the British\" did something. I can only say that if this is so it gives offence and causes great emotion among many people\".
