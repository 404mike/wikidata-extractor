He was the first studio guitarist of Siouxsie and the Banshees. He was a member of the group from July 1977 until September 1979. He played a \"jagged unorthodox chording\", and created a \"metal-shard roar\" with his guitar. Q magazine included McKay's work on \"Hong Kong Garden\" in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever\". He recorded two studio albums with the band, their debut album The Scream in 1978  and the sophomore album Join Hands in 1979.\nMcKay has directly influenced many guitarists such as Geordie Walker of Killing Joke, Robert Smith of the Cure, the Edge of U2, John McGeoch, Steve Albini of Big Black, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain, Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine and Boz Boorer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Siouxsie and the Banshees", "response": ["Siouxsie and the Banshees were a British rock band, formed in London in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and bass guitarist Steven Severin. They have been widely influential, both over their contemporaries and with later acts. Q magazine included John McKay's guitar playing on \"Hong Kong Garden\"  in their list of \"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever\", while Mojo rated guitarist John McGeoch in their list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" for his work on \"Spellbound\". The Times cited the group as \"one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\".", "While the band intended to split up after the gig, they were asked to play again. Over the next few months, Siouxsie and Severin recruited drummer Kenny Morris - and guitarist Peter Fenton. After playing several gigs in early 1977, they realised that Fenton did not fit in because he was \"a real rock guitarist\". John McKay finally took his place in July. Their first live appearance on television took place in November on Manchester's  Granada, on Tony Wilson's TV show So It Goes. That month they also recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio in which they premiered a new song \"Metal Postcard\", introducing a \"motorik austerity\" in the drums patterns, with \"the space in the sound\" and \"the serrated guitars\". The band described their music as \"cold, machine-like and passionate at the same time\". When they appeared on the cover of Sounds magazine, Vivien Goldman wrote: \"they sound like a 21st century industrial plant\"."]}, {"page": "The Cure", "response": ["The Cure released their debut album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges took control of the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted: \"a lot of it was very superficial \u2013 I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it.\" The band's second single, \"Boys Don't Cry\", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double-duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: \"On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing.\""]}, {"page": "Robert Smith (musician)", "response": ["Robert Smith met Steven Severin of Siouxsie and the Banshees at a Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire gig at the London YMCA on 3 August 1979.Thompson, Dave & Jo-Ann Greene.

He said, \"The two groups that I aspired to be like were [Siouxsie and] the Banshees and the Buzzcocks. I really liked the Buzzcocks' melodies, while the great thing about the Banshees was that they had this great wall of noise, which I'd never heard before. My ambition was to marry the two.\" Ian Birch of Melody Maker recognised the Banshees' influence on Smith's band early on, comparing The Cure's 1978 debut single \"Killing An Arab\" favourably to Siouxsie's \"Hong Kong Garden\" (released a few months earlier). Speaking of his stint of playing guitar with Siouxsie and the Banshees in 1979, Smith said, \"It allowed me to experiment. I inherited an approach from [[John McKay (musician)|John [McKay]], the Banshee's first guitarist] which was just to have everything full up.
