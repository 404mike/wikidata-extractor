An architect, he was called for professional purposes Louis de Soissons.\nde Soissons was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, but moved in childhood with his family to London. In 1913 he won the first year of the Henry Jarvis scholarship of the Royal Institute of British Architects, enabling three years of European travel and study.The first major commission of the practice he set up (Louis de Soissons Partnership) was the 'master plan' (so-called - a very early use of the term) for Welwyn Garden City (1920), a planned town created by Ebenezer Howard in neo-Georgian style, built on cheap redundant farmland. Louis de Soissons was appointed architect for the town in 1920 and the practice was significantly involved in its development over the next 60 years. He designed the concrete Shredded Wheat factory for the eponymous Canadian company.\nOther important early projects included the Home Office and Duchy of Cornwall Estates in London, where the future Edward VIII was the effective client and the Nag's Head Estate in Bethnal Green, London, E2 which was one of the few private \"slum clearance\" projects undertaken by a private landlord. When young he had been much influenced by 18th-century Italian architecture, and gained a reputation as a classical architect, but with a deep humanism resulting from his new town work.\nAfter the Second World War the firm expanded to Plymouth and Exeter to carry out a wide variety of architectural work. Nearly 50 War Cemeteries were designed for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Greece and Italy. Later the practice\u2019s buildings included a number of important buildings, such as the Wellcome Foundation, The Leathersellers Company, (a reconstruction in 1948 after wartime bombing), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Regent's Park and the International Wool Secretariat in Carlton Terrace, London. He also designed the Hobbs' Gates at The Oval cricket ground, in memory of Sir Jack Hobbs, the noted Surrey and England player, and a statue of George VI.\nThe Crown Estates Commissioners retained the firm to restore Cumberland and Chester Terraces, by John Nash. For the MCC work has been carried out on seating. Work for academic institutions included Eton College, and Exeter and Cambridge Universities.\nIn 1923 Louis de Soissons became a fellow of the RIBA and a member of both the Town Planning Institute, later RTPI, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Architectes Dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s par le Gouvernement. He was made an academician - a fellow of the Royal Academy - in 1953 and was awarded the RIBA distinction in town planning in 1945.\nIn the 1956 New Year Honours he was decorated with the CVO.\nThe firm changed tack in the 1960s, and commercial work such as the Brighton Marina shows a greater deference to modernism. The firm's headquarters are now in Luton, Bedfordshire.\nLouis de Soissons married Elinor Penrose-Thackwell, by whom he had three sons: Philip (killed in action 1941), Maurice (1927\u20132019) and Brian (1929\u20132009).\nhttps://www.architecture.com/image-library/RIBApix/image-information/poster/louis-de-soissons/posterid/RIBA24016.html\nhttps://www.cwgc.org/learn/horticulture-and-works/our-architects/louis-de-soissons\nhttps://www.architecture.com/image-library/RIBApix/licensed-image/poster/louis-de-soissons/posterid/RIBA24016.html\nhttps://louisdesoissons.com/history/\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1962", "response": ["** Louis de Soissons, Canadian-born English architect (b. 1890)"]}, {"page": "Pastiche", "response": ["In discussions of urban planning, the term \"pastiche\" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major architects: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many 20th century European developments can in this way be described as pastiches, such as the work of Louis de Soissons and Edwin Lutyens who created early 20th century Neoclassical and Neo-Georgian  architectural developments in Britain, or of later pastiche works based on the architecture of the modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and the Bauhaus movement.

It described Welwyn Garden City as a world-famous modern new town developed as an experiment in community planning and Hatfield as an unplanned settlement created by sporadic building in the open country.  \"Welwyn, though far from perfect, made the New Towns Act possible, just as Hatfield, by its imperfection, made it necessary.\"The Times, Saturday, 3 January 1948, p. 5 In 1966, the Development Corporation was wound up and handed over to the Commission for New Towns.

She decided to stay in the United Kingdom and a year later, she became an associate in the Louis de Soissons Partnership. Here, she spent eight years working on design and construction of the Brighton Marina. In 1976, she became a British citizen.

All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17\u00a0June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine.Colvin, p. 168  Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana.  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work.Colvin, p. 173 When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \"general idea\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs."]}, {"page": "Arthur Kenyon", "response": ["Kenyon worked with Louis de Soissons at Welwyn Garden City for eighteen years designining many of the houses there.
