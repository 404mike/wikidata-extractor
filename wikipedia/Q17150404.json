He studied at Brighton House School and it was planned that he would become an actuary, but music had a greater pull on him, and he studied singing with Frederic King in London, Victor Maurel in Paris, and Karl Scheidemantel in Dresden.  Maurel had believed Heyner's true range was that of a bass, but it proved to be baritone."]}]}}
