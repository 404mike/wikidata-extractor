A forward, he scored 45 goals in 215 league games in seven seasons in the Football League.\nHe began his career at Notts County in 1963, and later played for Ilkeston Town and Buxton, before coming to prominence with Boston United between 1969 and 1974. After finishing as Northern Premier League runners-up in 1971\u201372, they won the league title in 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374. In August 1974, he was signed by Colchester United for a \u00a36,000 fee. Crowned the club's player of the year in 1975, he helped the club to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1976\u201377. He was signed by Port Vale for \u00a310,000 in February 1978, before being sold on to Northampton Town for \u00a38,000 seven months later. He returned to Boston United the following year, and managed the club in three Alliance Premier League campaigns between 1981 and 1984. He later spent two years in charge at Ilkeston Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boston United F.C.", "response": ["| John Froggatt"]}, {"page": "Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1944)", "response": ["A day after leaving Bury he was appointed as manager of Port Vale. He replaced club legend Roy Sproson, and was given a large war chest to spend after a successful lottery scheme was set up at Vale Park. He took over with the club in 21st place in the Third Division. His first game in charge was a 0\u20130 draw with Midland Counties League side Arnold in the First Round of the FA Cup. In January, veteran defender Graham Hawkins was signed as a player-coach from Blackburn Rovers for \u00a36,000. Forward Neville Chamberlain also joined the club as a professional, becoming the club's first black pro. John Froggatt also joined the club, signing from Colchester United for \u00a310,000. Chairman Arthur McPherson celebrated this abandonment of frugality by declaring \"we are going places\". Local journalist Chris Harper slated the board for their decisions, calling them 'berserk'. Froggatt scored fifteen seconds into his debut in a 4\u20130 win over Exeter City. However this would be as good as it got for both Froggatt and Vale that season. In February, Vale beat Fort Lauderdale Strikers in a friendly, but also started a five games sequence without a win. Ged Stenson arrived the next month from Everton for a 'bargain' \u00a33,000, and John Lumsdon joined on loan from Stoke City. Vale improved, and were unbeaten in six of their seven March games, with Chamberlain scoring on his debut. Yet on 28 March they started a club-record streak of twelve home games without a win that would continue into the following season. Encouragement came from the youth side, who reached the Quarter Finals of the FA Youth Cup. With four games to go, Vale were one point clear of the drop, however by losing all of their remaining games the \"Valiants\" ended the 1977\u201378 season in 21st place and were relegated into the Fourth Division. Smith was appointed as manager of Swindon Town in May 1978, with the club having to pay a compensation fee of \u00a310,500 to Port Vale. His assistant, Dennis Butler, stayed on at the club and was appointed as his successor."]}]}}
