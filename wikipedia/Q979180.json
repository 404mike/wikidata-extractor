Montrose initially joined the Covenanters in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, but subsequently supported King Charles I as the English Civil War developed. From 1644 to 1646, and again in 1650, he fought in the civil war in Scotland on behalf of the King. He is referred to as the Great Montrose.\nFollowing his defeat and capture at the Battle of Carbisdale, Montrose was tried by the Scottish Parliament and sentenced to death by hanging, followed by beheading and quartering. After the Restoration, Charles II paid \u00a3802 sterling for a lavish funeral in 1661, when Montrose's reputation changed from traitor or martyr to a romantic hero and subject of works by Walter Scott and John Buchan. His spectacular victories, which took his opponents by surprise, are remembered in military history for their tactical brilliance.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose (1612\u20131650, S)"]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose (1612\u20131650), Covenanter and Royalist leader of Highland Armies"]}, {"page": "History of Scotland", "response": ["However, not all Scots supported the Covenanter's taking arms against their King. In 1644, James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose attempted to raise the Highlands for the King. Few Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen troops sent by the Irish Confederates under Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla), and an instinctive genius for mobile warfare, he was stunningly successful. A Scottish Civil War began in September 1644 with his victory at battle of Tippermuir. After a series of victories over poorly trained Covenanter militias, the lowlands were at his mercy. However, at this high point, his army was reduced in size, as MacColla and the Highlanders preferred to continue the war in the north against the Campbells. Shortly after, what was left of his force was defeated at the Battle of Philiphaugh. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops; but in July 1646 his army was disbanded after the King surrendered to the Scots army at Newark, and the civil war came to an end.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 217\u20138."]}, {"page": "May 21", "response": ["*1650 \u2013 James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, Scottish general and politician (b. 1612)"]}, {"page": "October 25", "response": ["*1612 \u2013 James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, Scottish soldier (d. 1650)"]}, {"page": "September 1", "response": ["*1644 \u2013 Battle of Tippermuir: James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose defeats the Earl of Wemyss's Covenanters, reviving the Royalist cause."]}, {"page": "1650", "response": ["* May 21 \u2013 James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, Scottish royalist (b. 1612)"]}, {"page": "1612", "response": ["* October 25 \u2013 James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, Scottish soldier (d. 1650)"]}, {"page": "Perthshire", "response": ["* James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose (1612\u20131650), Scottish nobleman, soldier and poet"]}, {"page": "Clan Ross", "response": ["David Ross 12th of Balnagowan signed the National Covenant at Inverness on 26 April 1638.MacKinnon, Donald.
