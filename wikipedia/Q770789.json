However, it has not flourished there in recent decades: its profile is highly dependent on the Wimbledon Championships, the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar. After Fred Perry's Wimbledon win in 1936, no British man won the singles until Andy Murray from Scotland did so in 2013. No British woman has won at Wimbledon since Virginia Wade in 1977. In addition, Perry's victory in the US National Championships (predecessor to the modern US Open) later in 1936 was the last for any British man in a Grand Slam singles event until Murray won the US Open in 2012. Wade remained the last British woman to win such an event until Emma Raducanu won the 2021 US Open. The governing body of the sport is the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), which invests the vast profits from the tournament in the game in the hope of producing British champions, but a string of revamps of the coaching system have failed to raise the standard of LTA-trained players. The only British players of either sex to reach the world top 50 in recent years are Greg Rusedski, who learnt his tennis in Canada, Tim Henman and Murray, who did not pass through the LTA system either, and on the women's side Anne Keothavong and the late Elena Baltacha both slipped into the world's top 50 during their careers. Outside of Wimbledon fortnight tennis's profile in Britain is low, and since the 2007 retirement of Rusedski and Henman is now largely dependent on Murray, the current UK number 1. Very recently (2015-), the rise of a number of other players, notably doubles specialist Jamie Murray, and younger top 50 players Laura Robson, Heather Watson, Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund has been supplemented by the spectacular rise of British women's number one Johanna Konta from a position outside the top 100 to the top ten in the world in just under eighteen months leading to October 2016. As a result, Great Britain had a top ten ranked men's singles, men's doubles and women's singles players at the same time for the first time ever. More recently, Raducanu's 2021 US Open win made her the first player of either sex to win a Grand Slam singles event as a qualifier in the Open era, and elevated her into the world top 25; she would finish the 2021 season in the top 20."]}, {"page": "Babolat", "response": ["*  Johanna Konta"]}, {"page": "WTA Awards", "response": ["| 2016 || Johanna Konta || ", "| 2020 || Kristie AhnGabriela Dabrowski (2)Madison KeysJohanna KontaAleksandra Kruni\u0107Christina McHaleKristina MladenovicAnastasia PavlyuchenkovaSloane StephensDonna Veki\u0107 || "]}, {"page": "Roberta Vinci", "response": ["Vinci began her clay court season at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix.
