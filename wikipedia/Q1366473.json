Within a year of Sim's publication Thomas Moore stated his view was that, on balance, Dickie's Bladder-fern was a variety of  C. fragilis. Various opinions have been published over the intervening years, with a consensus that C. dickeana was a separate species emerging in the 1930s, although recent research suggests that Moore's caution may have been appropriate.Parks, J.C., Dyer, F.A. and Lindsay, S. (2000)  \"Allozyme, Spore and Frond Variation in Some Scottish Populations of the Ferns Cystopteris dickieana and Cystopteris fragilis\". Edinburgh Journal of Botany 57: pp. 83-105. Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 1 June 2008. C. dickeana has broader,  less divided and more closely spaced pinnae than C. fragilis and the spores of the former are typically wrinkled and ridged rather than the spiny form of the latter's. However, there are significant variations within the populations of both forms and these characteristics are by no means fixed. On the other hand, there is also evidence that crosses of the two types produce sterile hybrids. C. Xmontserratii (Prada & Salvo) Fraser-Jenkins is a proposed hybrid between C. dickeana and C. fragilis."]}, {"page": "Lovell Augustus Reeve", "response": ["*Thomas Moore (1821\u20131887) en 1855 A Popular History of the British Ferns and the Allied Plants (1855)"]}, {"page": "Austroblechnum durum", "response": ["Thomas Moore described this species as follows: "]}, {"page": "T.Moore", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Moore (botanist)"]}, {"page": "Todea barbara", "response": ["Carl Linnaeus described the king fern in volume II of his Species Plantarum as Acrostichum barbarum in 1753, from Africa.

R. Robinson Scott was the first to identify the fern as a new species, based on specimens collected in 1861, on the west bank of the Schuylkill River about  above Philadelphia. The one specimen he found was taken for cultivation and divided. As it was collected in an area where walking fern and ebony spleenwort (then known as Camptosorus rhizophyllus and Asplenium ebeneum, respectively) were abundant, and the fern appeared to be a hybrid between the two, Scott tentatively referred to it as Asplenium ebenoides and sent specimens to prominent pteridologists to see if it was a new species. After three years, Asa Gray concurred in recognizing it as a new species. Specimens sent to England in 1864 and intended for Thomas Moore never reached him, but a frond and a print were sent by Scott to Rev. M.J. Berkeley in May 1865, who shared the material with Sir William Hooker. Berkeley endorsed Scott's identification of A.\u00a0ebenoides as a novel hybrid; Hooker, more cautiously, declared that \"if there were such things as hybrid ferns, this might be one.\" Until this point, descriptions of A.\u00a0ebenoides had circulated largely in private correspondence, but the first formal description of the fern was published in August 1865 in Gardener's Monthly, a Philadelphia magazine of horticulture. Rev. Berkeley's discussion of A.\u00a0ebenoides and the horticultural possibilities of hybridizing ferns prompted D. C. Eaton to question whether A.\u00a0ebenoides was distinct from A.\u00a0hendersonii, but this was strongly rebutted by Berkeley, as well as the suggestion that it might be a form of A.\u00a0pinnatifidum. Alphonso Wood placed the species in Camptosorus as C.\u00a0ebenoides in 1870, but this name was never widely accepted."]}, {"page": "Stoke next Guildford", "response": ["*Thomas Moore (1821\u201387), a British gardener and botanist, was born at Stoke.

In 1857, Thomas Moore, in his Index Filicum, transferred it to Platyloma, a genus he recognized as a segregate from Pellaea, as Platyloma pulchellum. John Smith, in 1866, preferred to recognize a different cheilanthoid segregate, Cincinalis, and placed it there as Cincinalis pulchella. In 1922, William Ralph Maxon created a new combination for Liebmann's name in Pellaea, as Pellaea formosa due to the illegitimacy of Martens & Galeotti's name, although subsequent changes to the practice of nomenclature would make it superfluous.
