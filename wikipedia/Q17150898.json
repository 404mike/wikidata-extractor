During the live promotional appearances for the album the band was joined by guitarist Owen Powell. This latest incarnation of the band lasted until its dissolution in 2001. The single \"You've Got a Lot to Answer For\" received radio airplay and became the band's first top 40 single in the UK Singles Chart in September 1996. Their breakout success came at the start of 1998 with the International Velvet album and the release of the single \"Mulder and Scully\" some two weeks apart. The album went to number one in the album chart, and sold more than 900,000 copies being certified triple platinum by British Phonographic Industry, while the single reached number 3 in the singles chart, the highest any Catatonia single would chart.", "Roberts and Matthews routinely encountered Owen Powell during this time, who played guitar in the band Colour 45. Both bands entered a band competition to play at the Cardiff Bay Music Fiesta, and while Colour 45 came tenth and was given a place on the bill, Sweet Catatonia placed 45th. Roberts and Matthews hired a drummer, Stephen \"Frog\" Jenkins from the band U Thant, and continued to record bilingual Welsh/English tracks. The band began to play live, with Matthews and Roberts busking to support their income. They were spotted by the girlfriend of the lead singer of the band The Pooh Sticks, who thought that Matthews would make a good female voice for the group. But after seeing Sweet Catatonia perform, the band members didn't agree and so Matthews remained with Catatonia. Further recordings were made, with Guto Pryce joining the trio. This session included the track \"Gyda Gwen\" which attracted the attention of Rhys Mwyn at Crai Records.", "Music reviewers responded with surprise when the band began to perform live while sober. Meanwhile, the release of \"Sweet Catatonia\" as a single was pushed back to January 1996 due to the issues with finding a new producer. The first time he met the band was when they arrived to record at the Maison Rouge Studios in London. They found working with him far easier than Sampson, as Matthews later explained that he took their ideas into account. Ieuan left during the recording of the album to join Super Furry Animals, and was subsequently replaced by Aled Richards. They returned to live performances after completing the recording of the album, and decided to actively look for a second guitarist. They ultimately hired Colour 45's Owen Powell, who by this time was working as a music technician for the Super Furry Animals, to this role.", "* Owen Powell \u2013 guitars (1996-2001)", "* Owen Powell \u2013 guitars"]}, {"page": "Paper Scissors Stone (album)", "response": ["* Owen Powell \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Culture of Wales", "response": ["Some of those bands have had ongoing success, while the general popularity of Welsh music during this period led to a resurgence of singers such as Tom Jones with his album Reload.
