Cleese had never performed Shakespeare before, and was not a fan of the first two seasons of the BBC Television Shakespeare. As such, he took some persuading from Miller that the BBC Shrew would not be, as Cleese feared \"about a lot of furniture being knocked over, a lot of wine being spilled, a lot of thighs being slapped and a lot of unmotivated laughter.\" Miller told Cleese that the episode would interpret Petruchio as an early Puritan more concerned with attempting to show Kate how preposterous her behaviour is (\"showing her an image of herself\" as Miller put itQuoted in ), rather than bullying her into submission, and as such, the part was not to be acted along the traditional lines of the swaggering braggart a la Richard Burton in Franco Zeffirelli's 1967 film adaptation. According to Cleese, who consulted a psychiatrist who specialised in treating \"shrews,\" \"Petruchio doesn't believe in his own antics, but in the craftiest and most sophisticated way he needs to show Kate certain things about her behaviour. He takes one look at her and realises that here is the woman for him, but he has to go through the process of 'reconditioning' her before anything else. So he behaves just as outrageously as she does in order to make her aware of the effect that her behaviour has on other people [...] Kate needs to be made happy \u2013 she is quite clearly unhappy at the beginning of the play, and then extremely happy at the end because of what she has achieved with Petruchio's help.\"Quoted in  Miller also researched how troublesome children were treated at the Tavistock Clinic, where imitation was often used during therapy; \"there are ways in which a skilful therapist will gently mock a child out of a tantrum by giving an amusing imitation of the tantrum immediately after its happened. The child then has a mirror held up to it and is capable of seeing what it looks like to others.\" In his review of the adaptation for the Financial Times, Chris Dunkley referred to this issue, calling Cleese's Petruchio \"an eccentrically pragmatic social worker using the wayward client's own doubtful habits to calm her down.\" Actress Sarah Badel had a similar conception of the psychology behind the production. She constructed an \"imaginary biography\" for Katherina, arguing, \"She's a woman of such passion [...] a woman of such enormous capacity for love that the only way she could be happy is to find a man of equal capacity. Therefore she's mad for lack of love [...] he feigns madness, she is teetering on the edge of it. Petruchio is the only man who shows her what she's like.\"Quoted in "]}, {"page": "Mrs Dalloway", "response": ["Dutch film director Marleen Gorris made a film version of Mrs Dalloway in 1997.
