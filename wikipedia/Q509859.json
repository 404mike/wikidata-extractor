For the next five years, they finished mid-table, flirting with relegation in 1988\u201389 (at which time Mathias was sacked and the previous manager Bryan Hamilton returned) and 1989\u201390, until they were relegated for the first time in the club's league history in 1992\u201393. Wigan Athletic finished in 23rd place, amid tumbling attendances which had fallen from averages of 3,000\u20134,000 in Wigan Athletic's Division 3 years to just 2,593 in 1992\u201393. Hamilton resigned shortly before the club were relegated, and was replaced by Kenny Swain. A year later, with the club back in the fourth tier of the English League, the Latics finished fourth from bottom, in 19th place. While there was no relegation that season due to the lack of a promotable club in the Football Conference, this remains the club's lowest-ever finish. The following season would prove to be arguably even worse, as Swain was sacked early in the campaign following a horrific start, and former player Graham Barrow took over as manager. Despite the club being rooted to the bottom of the table until the start of December, the second half of the campaign saw a major upturn in form, and they finished well clear of the relegation zone in 15th place.
