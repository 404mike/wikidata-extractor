They planned ahead, Erasmus thinking \"It will be very pleasant our being together, we shall be as cozy as possible\", arriving early at Edinburgh to make social contact with old friends of the family in Whig society, and so \"we can both read like horses\". Erasmus enrolled with John Lizars, a \"charming\" and respectable surgeon on the other side of Surgeon's Square from his chief rival as a private tutor, the flamboyant Robert Knox who two years later became embroiled with the body-snatchers Burke and Hare. Near the end of March Erasmus finished his hospital study, leaving Charles behind, and enrolled in a London anatomy school."]}, {"page": "North Runcton", "response": ["Four Ionic columns support the domed roof with other columns supporting the tripartite chancel arch.Norfolk 2: Norfolk: North-west and South, By Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson, North Runcton entry. 0-300-09657-7 The reredos panelling is the work of Bell.
