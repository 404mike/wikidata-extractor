Harbouring an ambition to be a director, he returned to education at the Liverpool Community College. He won a place on the Media Production Bachelor of Arts course at Bournemouth University, and graduated with first class honours in 1996.Neilson's television career began as an assistant director on EastEnders all the way back in 1998.

It was then in September 2001 that Neilson appeared officially in the credits as a director, when he directed his first episode of EastEnders. In 2004, a double episode set in the launderette with Dot Cotton telling Den Watts she had cancer won a TV Moments award, named as 'Best Popular Drama Moment' of 2004.As well as directing for the BBC, he has also directed episodes of The Bill and Family Affairs for TalkbackThames. In 2008 he began directing the new series of Minder for FIVE which was later axed due to poor viewing figures.In 2015, EastEnders celebrated its thirtieth anniversary with a Live Week. Neilson directed the live week episodes along with the flashback episode. Commenting upon directing the dramatic culmination of the week, Neilson said: \"As a director it's an absolute gift of a week, because it's a story where the audience are continually looking for meaning in every line and every reaction. Because of that I was determined to get very specific performances which would steer the story as I wanted it to be steered throughout the week.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Simon Ashdown", "response": ["|Best Single Episode (with Karl Neilson)"]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders crew members", "response": ["*Karl Neilson (2001\u20132007, 2009\u20132019)"]}, {"page": "List of awards and nominations received by EastEnders", "response": ["| Karl Neilson, direction; Simon Ashdown, writer (The identity of Kat's lover is revealed) || ", "| Episode 5020 \u2013 Live Episode; James Payne (writer), Karl Neilson (director) || ", "| Kathy comes home; Karl Neilson and Richard Lynn (directors) || ", "| Scene of the Year || Lauren Branning and Abi Branning's rooftop fall (Karl Neilson, director) ||  (joint win with Doctors)"]}, {"page": "Who's Been Sleeping with Kat?", "response": ["Richie spoke to Inside Soap about Alfie's reaction, saying that when he discovers it is one of the three Branning brothers, it \"really tips him over the edge, and Alfie becomes a monster.

He explained that he and Wallace spent a lot of time with the episode's director, Karl Neilson, \"just going over stuff, finding out where the emotions were, who was the victim, who was on the offensive, who was on the defensive\", where usually there are no rehearsals. Richie also revealed that the bedsit set was a \"tiny space\" that was purposely built for the episodes, which Richie said was \"quite claustrophobic\". He called it a \"square room [with] nowhere to hide\", with \"every blink of the eye, every look, every frown, every sigh\" being seen, adding \"if you're looking angry, it's there to be seen, you're naked to it\". He said he \"loved\" that about filming the episode, and said, \"you work hard to try and be as good an actor as you can and then you're given an opportunity by the BBC and by EastEnders to step up to the mark.

In an interview with Digital Spy, he stated: \"I spoke to [executive producer] Dominic [Treadwell-Collins] about it in August last year. I'd been working very hard to get this block of episodes - I really wanted to do them because it's my own 20th anniversary this year of working on the show. I knew that these episodes were going to be massive, so I did do a good pitch to try and get the job! They came to me in August and said that I would be directing and I was thrilled. I then started working on the episodes at the beginning of November.\" After Tuesday's filming had been completed a small fire broke out on the set, the cause of which was a firework. The fire took place on the first floor and roof space of one of the buildings, but it did not cause any immediate production changes. Later it was revealed to be a firework from the end of Friday's episode during a rehearsal."]}, {"page": "Kat & Alfie: Redwater", "response": ["Filming was scheduled to take place in Ireland over a period of three to four months. On 5 April 2016, Treadwell-Collins tweeted the front page of the script from the first episode, confirming that the first read-through was that day, and the episode was written by Matthew Graham. The other writers for the series are Lauren Klee, Matthew Barry (two episodes) and Julie Dixon (two episodes), though Graham oversaw the storylines for the other five episodes. Jesper W. Nielsen (four episodes) and Karl Neilson (two episodes) are the directors and Victoria Wharton is the producer. Graham said he was attracted to the series because he used to be a writer for EastEnders and found Kat and Alfie to be \"two of the most dynamic characters to write for\", and wanted to \"[create] the debris from [Kat's] explosive arrival [in Redwater]\"."]}]}}
