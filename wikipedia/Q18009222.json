It was built in 1787 by the Reverend DrThomas Sedgwick Whalley, who married the wealthy heiress of nearby Langford Court. A spendthrift who entertained lavishly, both at Langford and at his house in the Royal Crescent, Bath, within ten years he was forced to let Langford Court and began to build Mendip Lodge at a reputed cost of \u00a360,000. Although built on the steep hillside, an ascent for carriages was made by cutting a new road winding through the woods. From this numerous footpaths led to scenic spots, including 52 grottoes, one for every week of the year, one of which led to the Church of Holy Trinity, Burrington, and a great number of trees and ornamental shrubs were planted, many of which remain in the area. After various changes of occupation it fell into disrepair and decay. It was destroyed deliberately by Civil Defence activities. All that remains is the ruined stable block."]}, {"page": "Thomas Whalley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Sedgwick Whalley"]}, {"page": "Thomas Warwick", "response": ["Both of Warwick\u2019s longer works focused on mediaeval relationships.
