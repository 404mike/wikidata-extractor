It was created in 1836 for Dominick Browne, who had earlier represented County Mayo in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baron, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1869 to 1900. Lord Oranmore and Browne assumed the surname of Guthrie on his marriage in 1859 to Christina Guthrie. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1902 to 1926 and a member of the short-lived Senate of Southern Ireland. In 1926 he was created Baron Mereworth, of Mereworth Castle in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave the barons an automatic seat in the House of Lords until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. On his death in 1927 the title passed to his son, the fourth Baron. He married, as his third wife, the actress Sally Gray. Lord Oranmore and Browne died in August 2002, aged 100 years and 291 days.

Director Herbert Wilcox had wanted Rex Harrison or John Mills and had only taken Wilding reluctantly. However, once he saw the rushes he signed Wilding to a long-term contract. Piccadilly Incident was the second most popular film at the British box office in 1946. After co-starring with Sally Gray in Carnival (1946), Wilding was reunited with Neagle and Wilcox in The Courtneys of Curzon Street (1947), the biggest hit at the 1947 British box office and one of the most-seen British films of all time. Alexander Korda cast him opposite Paulette Goddard in An Ideal Husband (1947), another hit, but it failed to recoup its enormous cost.

After an air raid in Warsaw by the German army, he is discovered by an American reporter, Carol Peters (Sally Gray), practising the piano in a bombed-out building. It is the opening of his Warsaw Concerto, at this point a work in progress, and the first line he says to her is, \"It is not safe to be out alone when the moon is so bright\" (referring to the moonlight bombing raids). Gazing intently at Carol and disclosing \"something lovely you've just given me\", he introduces the lyrical second theme of the Concerto. And, indeed, this melody is always associated with Carol.Laing, Heather, \"The Gendered Score: Music and Gender in 1940s Melodrama and the Woman's Film\", Ashgate Publishing, 2007, pp.156-9. Like Rachmaninoff, Addinsell introduces it almost as a nocturne. Stefan speaks of the piece later in the film: \"This music is you and me. It's the story of the two of us in Warsaw, of us in America, of us in \u2026 where else I don't know. That's why I can't finish it\". But finish it he does. Similar to the way that Rachmaninoff returns to his second theme in his Second Piano Concerto, the \"Carol\" melody is used, not only to bind together the emotional strands of the drama, but to bring the Concerto to a triumphant conclusion. Throughout the film, the unfinished piece is defined in a relationship with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's \"Military\" Polonaise, symbolising Polish patriotism. It is \"completed\" when the Polonaise elements are integrated with the Romantic theme, implying the fusion of romantic and patriotic love.", "* In Triple Cross (1966), Eddie Chapman, played by Christopher Plummer, confuses this tune with the title of the movie Dangerous Moonlight, a film he claims he saw with Sally Gray and Anton Walbrook in it."]}, {"page": "They Made Me a Fugitive", "response": ["* Sally Gray as Sally "]}, {"page": "Green for Danger (film)", "response": ["Green for Danger is a 1946 British thriller film, based on the 1944 detective novel of the same name by Christianna Brand.
