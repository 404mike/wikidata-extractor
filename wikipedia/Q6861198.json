The adaptation was basically faithful to the novel but lost many of the connections to Sharpe's Siege as a result of an original story, Sharpe's Mission, being placed between the adaptations: Instead of the duel with Bampfylde, Sharpe fights a similar duel with Colonel Wigram, the officer who later commands his court martial, for insulting him at Toulouse and Lucille's brother is not Lassan but Maillot, the officer in charge of Napoleon's treasure (with their mother omitted entirely). Nairn's role is given to Major-General Ross, an original recurring character in the series, and the character's fate changed so he is merely wounded. D'Alembord is also omitted and other characters have their names changed, with Lady Molly Spinacre becoming Lady Molly Hardcastle and Lucille's married name change from Castineau to Duberre. Frederickson learns of Sharpe and Lucille's relationship much earlier, before travelling to Naples, leaving them semi-reconciled at the end and Ducos' death is altered, with Sharpe shooting him from a distance as he tries to escape. Lucille's pregnancy was also left out, since the adaptation was followed by another original story, Sharpe's Justice, and ends with Sharpe and Harper saying goodbye to Lucille and returning to England."]}, {"page": "Flying the Flag", "response": ["|Brown - Milton Johns, Bryant - Stuart Organ"]}, {"page": "Sharpe's Revenge (TV programme)", "response": ["* Milton Johns \u2013 Hopkinson"]}, {"page": "List of Star Wars cast members", "response": ["| Milton Johns"]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac cast members", "response": ["*Milton Johns"]}, {"page": "Johns (surname)", "response": ["* Milton Johns (born 1938), British television actor"]}, {"page": "The Intruder (Townsend novel)", "response": ["The book was adapted into a British television series, The Intruder, by Granada Television in 1971, broadcast 1972.
