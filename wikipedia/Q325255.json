In this period, too, ethology began to develop strongly in North America."]}, {"page": "March 31", "response": ["*1938 \u2013 Patrick Bateson, English biologist and academic (d. 2017)"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Patrick Bateson (1938\u20132017), English biologist and science writer, president of the Zoological Society of London"]}, {"page": "Bastet", "response": ["Cats in ancient Egypt were highly revered, partly due to their ability to combat vermin such as mice, rats (which threatened key food supplies), and snakes\u2014especially cobras.
