The names  ( + territorial suffix , 'territory of Morgan') and  ( + , 'land of Morgan') reputedly derive from the 8th-century king Morgan ab Athrwys, otherwise known as \"Morgan Mwynfawr\" ('great in riches') who united Glywysing with the neighbouring kingdoms of Gwent and Ergyng, although some have argued for the similar 10th-century ruler Morgan Hen.

Still, only after the 13th century are there records which better showed free female peasants' rights to land.
