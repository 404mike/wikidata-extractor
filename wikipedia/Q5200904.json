On 11 May 1936, the Type 138A performed its maiden flight, piloted by Cyril Uwins. On 28 September 1936, Squadron Leader F.R.D. Swain set a new world record altitude record, having climbed to an indicated altitude of 51,000\u00a0ft (15,440\u00a0m), which was homologated as 49,967\u00a0ft (15,230\u00a0m). After this milestone, research flights continued, along with further attempts to break the altitude record. Further development of the aircraft after the first record-breaking flight led to a series of small modifications being implemented. The last record-breaking flight was flown on 30 June 1937. A second aircraft, designated as the Type 138B, was ordered in 1935 but work on it was abandoned during 1937 without ever having flown.", "In early 1936, the airframe was completed; on 11 May 1936, the Type 138A was flown for the first time, powered by a standard Pegasus IV which drove a three-bladed propeller. For this maiden flight, it was piloted by Cyril Uwins, Bristol's chief test pilot, who had previously flown the Vickers Vespa on its world record flight. Two additional flights were performed at Filton prior to the aircraft being delivered to the RAE at Farnborough. The RAE conducted a series of tests of the pressure helmet prior to the aircraft being returned to Filton for the installation of the special Pegasus engine and a corresponding four-blade airscrew.

This first flight was short: 'Always a bad sign' remarked Archibald Russell (later Sir Archibald), who at that time was working in the stress calculations office at Filton. Uwins reported that control in the roll axis was poor. A second flight, during which Uwins pushed the speed up to 100\u00a0mph, revealed that the problem became worse as speed increased. Uwins was unable to observe the wing's behaviour (He had a damaged neck thanks to an aircraft accident). It was decided that the aircraft was safe enough to carry an observer if the speed was kept down, and Russell, who had recently been working on measuring the deflection of the aircraft's wing spars under load, was given the job. The rear gun position gave an excellent view of the wing. Uwins and Russell agreed on a simple system of hand signals in order to communicate."]}, {"page": "Bristol Type 101", "response": ["Cleaner and more compact than most aircraft in its class, the 101 displayed relatively high performance when first flown in 1927.

Continued as a private venture, it first flew at Filton on 8 August 1927, piloted by Cyril Uwins, registered G-EBOW. With the VIA powerplant, Uwins achieved second place in the 1928 King's Cup race at an average speed of 159.9\u00a0mph. Subsequently, used as a company hack and as a testbed for the 485\u00a0hp Bristol Mercury II nine-cylinder radial, it suffered wing centre section failure on 29 November 1929 while being subjected to engine overspeeding tests, the pilot, C. R. L. Shaw, bailing out successfully.

This revealed control problems caused by twisting of the wing caused by the overlarge ailerons.  For the second fight, bracing wires were added to the wing, but immediately after takeoff on a second flight the spinner disintegrated, the debris causing damage to the wing covering, and the flight was restricted to a single circuit.  The first flight had taken place with the spinner unpainted:  it had subsequently been painted, and the additional weight of the paint had caused the  failure.   A third flight, without any spinner, revealed that there was still a problem with the ailerons.  An attempt to rectify this was made by fitting a device which produced a small control surface movement for small movements of the joystick, with the rate of control surface displacement progressively increasing as stick displacement was increased.  This device, which used a cam on the bottom of the joystick to displace a pair of rollers connected to the ailerons, worked on the ground but under flight loads the rollers were pulled out of contact with the cam, resulting in  loss of lateral control.  Uwins made yet another wide circuit in the aircraft and again managed a safe landing.  For the next flight the cam device was removed and the control issue addressed by reducing the area of the ailerons to around 40% of their original area.  At the same time a new spinner was fitted, this being designed to remain static.  Three further flights were made, during the last two of which the undercarriage was successfully operated.   Although the aircraft had been entered for the 1922 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe competition, and was allocated  the racing number 10 which was painted on the tail, it was not in a fit condition to compete, and although it was suggested that it be used as an engine testbed, its flight characteristics were entirely unsuitable for this role and it was eventually scrapped in 1924.Barnes 1981, pp. 124\u2013125."]}, {"page": "Bristol Type 118", "response": ["The Jaguar-engined first prototype, registered as G-ABEZ  flew on 22 January 1931, piloted by Cyril Uwins.

In the meantime Air Ministry interest in the Type 118 had increased and they hired \"R-3\", now powered by a Mercury V, fitted with a four-blade propeller and stripped of armament for endurance and desert trials (in Iraq) of that engine from February 1932.

Engine exhaust and cooling were also improved. The long-span ailerons were shortened and combined with centre section split flaps. The aircraft was almost ready to attend the competitive tests at RAF Martlesham Heath when W.T. Campbell entered a spin with the undercarriage unintentionally down.
