The tie at Twerton Park would be striker Keith Scott's last game, he signed for Premier League Swindon Town for an eventual fee of \u00a3375,000. His replacement was Tony Hemmings, signed earlier in the season from Northwich Victoria and he made an immediate impact, scoring twice in a 3\u20131 home win over promotion rivals Crewe Alexandra. The following weekend the club travelled up to another promotion rival, Preston North End. Their Deepdale ground still had a plastic pitch and they were managed by John Beck. Two goals from Tim Langford were cancelled out but a last minute strike from Hakan Hayrettin, his only goal for Wycombe, from just inside the Preston half stunned the home crowd and sent the visiting fans in delirium. Premier League Norwich City ended interest in the FA Cup, winning the third round tie at Adams Park 2\u20130. There was still another cup run to be had in the Associate Members Cup. The Southern Area Quarter-Final at Craven Cottage saw 2,500 Wycombe fans make the short trip into the capital to see Tim Langford notch a brace in a 2\u20132 draw. The game went to penalties and Jason Cousins tucked home the winning spot-kick to spark more celebrations. The game marked the debut of striker Simon Garner, who soon become a cult hero at Adams Park. Victory did come at a cost, centre-back Terry Evans was injured and missed the rest of the season."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["The opening of the transfer window on 1 July saw Southport players Andy Parry and Shaun Whalley sign for undisclosed fees, and out-of-contract Histon duo Danny Fitzsimons and Jim Stevenson also join the club.
