He had got involved with gangsters and built up a debt which he paid off by signing over his 4x4. Chris had a daughter, Lisa, it was revealed after he previously told the watch that he never had kids. He had not seen his daughter for 11 years. He took over as head of the watch from Sub Officer Pearce and it immediately got under Geoff's skin but Geoff mellowed and they eventually had a good working relationship. Chris found out in series 11 that his daughter was infatuated with Recall. He totally misread the situation at one point, and called the police accusing Recall of rape, when she came home upset after Recall rebuffed her advances. In series 12 after dropping a very drunk George home after a night of gambling, a kiss with George's wife Kelly soon began an affair which rapidly progressed. Chris spoke up for Recall as a supporting witness at Recall's assault inquiry. Chris was left upset just after the halfway point in series 12, when his old watch rival but now superior to him D.O. Griggs, informed him he was being transferred to health and safety with immediate effect. At this point his affair with Kelly was still in progress. George discovered what was going on during Pearce's wedding day when he saw Kelly and Chris kissing. Chris was not seen again until series 13 when he was reunited with his watch, and George, now divorced from Kelly, got jealous and angry when he saw Chris put his hand on Kelly and punched him to the ground. He later made amends with George by convincing him to patch things up with Andi."]}, {"page": "64 Zoo Lane", "response": ["* Seamus the Stork (voiced by Jonathan Guy Lewis) \u2013 A stork who flies very fast."]}, {"page": "Laurence Fox", "response": ["| Our Boys (1993) by Jonathan Guy Lewis"]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Ian Bentley || Jonathan Guy Lewis || 1999"]}, {"page": "List of Coronation Street characters (1999)", "response": ["Ian Bentley, played by Jonathan Guy Lewis, first appeared on 29 January 1999.
