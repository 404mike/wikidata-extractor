The Inheritors (1955) shows \"new people\" (generally identified with Homo sapiens sapiens), triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with Neanderthals) by deceit and violence. His 1956 novel Pincher Martin records the thoughts of a drowning sailor. Free Fall (1959) explores the issue of freedom of choice. The novel's narrator, a World War Two soldier in a German POW Camp, endures interrogation and solitary confinement. After these events and while recollecting the experiences, he looks back over the choices he has made, trying to trace precisely where he lost the freedom to make his own decisions. The Spire (1964) follows the construction (and near collapse) of an impossibly large spire on the top of a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be Salisbury Cathedral). The novel explores ideas of sexual lust, religious fervour and delusion, and the power of the Church in Medieval England, with the titular spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity."]}, {"page": "School and university in literature", "response": ["* Nigel Williams: Class Enemy"]}, {"page": "Putney", "response": ["*Nigel Williams, author"]}, {"page": "Wimbledon, London", "response": ["In literature, Wimbledon provides the principal setting for several comic novels by author Nigel Williams (including the best-selling The Wimbledon Poisoner and They Came from SW19), as well as for Elisabeth Beresford's series of children's stories about the Wombles."]}, {"page": "Darien, Connecticut", "response": ["Chapter 14 of English author Nigel Williams' 1994 travelogue From Wimbledon to Waco tells of his difficulties in reaching Darien from Interstate 95."]}, {"page": "1948 in literature", "response": ["*January 20 \u2013 Nigel Williams, English author, playwright and screenwriter"]}, {"page": "Toyah Willcox", "response": ["The possibility of a role in the Sex Pistols' film, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle under director Russ Meyer having fallen through, Willcox went on to play Miranda in Derek Jarman's version of The Tempest, which won her a nomination as Best Newcomer at the 1980 Evening Standard Awards.
