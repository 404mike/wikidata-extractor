He was British national time trial champion six times, jointly holding the record for most wins with Alex Dowsett.Dangerfield won his first RTTC national  time trial championship in 1992 in the hill-climb event - a victory he repeated in 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1997. In 1997, he was also 25-mile (40 km) time trial champion; he also won the event four consecutive times from 2000 to 2003. He won his first national 10-mile (16 km) championship in 2001, with repeat victories in 2003 and 2004. In 2001 he broke 10 miles (16 km) competition record with a time of 18'19\" (32.76 mph), knocking eight seconds off the previous record, set by Graeme Obree in 1993.\nAt world championship level, he has represented Great Britain in the individual time trial event at Holland 1998, Brittany 2000, Portugal 2001 and Belgium 2002. He also represented England at the Commonwealth Games in Canada 1994, Malaysia 1998 and Manchester 2002.\nDangerfield was little known outside club cycling circles in Britain, having grown up in the shadow of firstly Chris Boardman and then David Millar. However, Millar's admission to using the illegal drug EPO and consequent expulsion from the Great Britain squad for the 2004 Summer Olympics meant that Dangerfield was called up into the Olympic squad to race the time trial. An injury to GB cyclist Jeremy Hunt also saw Dangerfield entered into the men's road race. Dangerfield finished 30th in the time trial, but did not finish the road race.At the Commonwealth Games in 2002 Dangerfield was disqualified for riding in the slipstream of a rider who had caught and passed him.Dangerfield retired from time trialling competition in 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left rowspan=2|Stuart Dangerfield"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual road race", "response": ["|align=left| Stuart Dangerfield ||align=left|  ||data-sort-value=9h 99' 99\"| "]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's road time trial", "response": ["| 29 ||align=left| Stuart Dangerfield ||  || 1:03:00.72"]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Stuart Dangerfield"]}, {"page": "Dangerfield", "response": ["*Stuart Dangerfield (born 1971), English racing cyclist"]}, {"page": "England at the 1998 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Stuart Dangerfield                 ||road time trial||"]}, {"page": "England at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Stuart Dangerfield"]}, {"page": "Joseph Sunde Memorial", "response": ["|2000 ||  Stuart Dangerfield"]}, {"page": "British National Time Trial Championships", "response": ["|align=center rowspan=2|6 ||Stuart Dangerfield ||align=left| 1995, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2005", "| 1995 || Stuart Dangerfield || ? || ?", "| 1996 || Stuart Dangerfield || Jonathan Clay || ?", "| 1997 || Graeme Obree || Stuart Dangerfield || Jonathan Clay", "| 1998 || Stuart Dangerfield || David Millar || Tim Buckle", "| 1999 || Chris Newton || David Millar || Stuart Dangerfield", "| 2001 || Stuart Dangerfield || Michael Hutchinson || Julian Ramsbottom", "| 2002 || Michael Hutchinson || Zak Carr || Stuart Dangerfield", "| 2003 || Stuart Dangerfield || Julian Winn || Kevin Dawson", "| 2005 || Stuart Dangerfield || Michael Hutchinson || Jonathan Dayus"]}, {"page": "British National Team Pursuit Championships", "response": ["|North Wirral VeloStuart Dangerfield, Simon LillistoneMatt Illingworth & Glen Sword"]}, {"page": "British National Hill Climb Championships", "response": ["| 1997 || Rowsley Bar, Derbyshire || Stuart Dangerfield || Jim Henderson || Jeff Wright", "| 1996 || Carlton Bank, Cleveland || Stuart Dangerfield || Steve Hulme || Jim Henderson", "| 1995 || Ditchling Beacon, East Sussex || Stuart Dangerfield || Jeff Wright || Chris Newton", "| 1994 || Jackson Bridge, West Yorkshire || Jeff Wright ||Stuart Dangerfield || Rob Harris", "| 1993 || Newlands Pass, Buttermere, Cumbria || Stuart Dangerfield ||Jeff Wright || Rob Reynolds-Jones", "| 1992 || St John's Chapel, County Durham || Stuart Dangerfield || Jeff Wright || Pete Longbottom", "| 1991 || Park Rash, Kettlewell, Yorkshire || Chris Boardman || Jeff Wright || Stuart Dangerfield", "| 1990 || Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon || Chris Boardman || Steve Marchant || Stuart Dangerfield"]}, {"page": "England at the 1994 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Stuart Dangerfield                             ||4,000m pursuit ||"]}, {"page": "2005 national road cycling championships", "response": ["|  ||Russell Downing || ||Stuart Dangerfield ||"]}, {"page": "British National Individual Pursuit Championships", "response": ["| 1993 || Graeme Obree || Bryan Steel || Stuart Dangerfield", "| 1994 || Graeme Obree || Bryan Steel || Stuart Dangerfield"]}, {"page": "1994 British National Track Championships", "response": ["| Stuart Dangerfield", "| North Wirral VeloStuart Dangerfield Simon LillistoneMatt IllingworthGlen Sword"]}, {"page": "1993 British National Track Championships", "response": ["| Stuart Dangerfield"]}]}}
