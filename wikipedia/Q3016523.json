Under former Leeds manager Gary McAllister, Richardson also played in the left-back position, playing a few games there as a replacement for on-loan Leicester City defender Alan Sheehan. After a poor performance in this position against Cheltenham Town, Richardson was booed off the pitch by Leeds fans and did not play for a few weeks after. He returned in his usual right-back position as a replacement for the injured Darren Kenton in their 1\u20130 win over Doncaster Rovers."]}]}}
