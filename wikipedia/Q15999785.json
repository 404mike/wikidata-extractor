Earlier that year, Cameron had told the 1922 Committee he saw in the crisis \"opportunities for Britain to maximise what we want in terms of our engagement with Europe\" in return for its acquiescence in the resolution. But in October German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne that there would be no repatriation of the EU's social and labour law authority. It was reported that while Sch\u00e4uble was not opposed to such a move in principle, he was upset with Cameron for speaking about the possibility so publicly at such a difficult time for the eurozone. But Benedict Brogan reported in the Daily Telegraph that, in addition to staffers Steve Hilton and Oliver Letwin, three members of Cameron's cabinet were so frustrated with EU labour regulation as an obstacle to the government's efforts to revive the British economy in the wake of the Great Recession that they would find a way to leave it if they could."]}]}}
