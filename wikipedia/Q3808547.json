She was born in London and educated in London, Paris, and Florence. Her first book, Out of Focus, appeared in 1931; among her other notable publications are biographies of Lady Hester Stanhope (1934) and Charles Stewart Parnell (1937). In addition, she was a regular journalist for the London Mercury, the Daily Mail, Evening News, and The Illustrated London News.\nShe also worked for the Italian section of the BBC from 1941 to 1944. Her books were generally regarded as accurate and fairly complete, although at times falling prey to \"outdated interpretations\".\nHaslip was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carlota of Mexico", "response": ["Several authors put forward an origin caused by intoxication. This hypothesis is notably put forward by Joan Haslip, who reveals that one of the Mexican court doctors added bromide to Charlotte's coffee without her knowing. In Mexico, from July 1867, rumours spread that the madness of the Empress was attributed to a poison which had been given to her regularly in small doses. Roger Heim's research corroborates this possibility, namely that Charlotte could have been \"little by little intoxicated while she was still in Mexico, by the introduction in her food for a prolonged time of a psychotropic drug\". When she made an official visit to Yucat\u00e1n, Charlotte wrote to her husband on 8 December 1865: \"The doctor is very nice. Without her well-suited little medications, I would probably have fallen ill and could not have taken all of this. On several occasions it seemed to me that there was poison in the air\"."]}, {"page": "Lady Hester Stanhope", "response": ["*Joan Haslip - Lady Hester Stanhope (1934)"]}, {"page": "Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria", "response": ["Archduke Rainer's mistakes as well as the lack of understanding between Rainer and Feldmarschall Graf Radetzky, were blamed for the disasters of the Italian Revolution of 1848.Joan Haslip, The Crown of Mexico, pp. 22, 89, 109.
