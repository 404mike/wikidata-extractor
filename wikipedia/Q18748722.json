He has had a long association with football in Folkestone after becoming a ballboy for his father's club Folkestone in 1958. He later played for the club as a goalkeeper and as an outfield player. He also served successor club Folkestone Invicta in a variety of roles, including goalkeeper, goalkeeping coach, groundsman and manager of the youth and reserve teams.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Towse", "response": ["* Gary Towse (born 1952), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["In the wake of Brentford's relegation straight back to the Fourth Division at the end of the previous season, manager Frank Blunstone, who had come to the end of his contract, left Griffin Park to take over as youth team manager at Manchester United.White, p. 292-294. Despite the relegation, fan support for Blunstone was high and the finger of blame pointed at the board of directors, with one letter to the Middlesex Chronicle summing up the situation that the board's penny-pinching ways since 1967 were \"necessary for a couple of years or so, but timidity of this sort prompts me to believe that promotion last year was an unwelcome accident, which has now been rectified\". Brentford entered pre-season without a manager and training was taken by full back Alan Hawley and other senior professionals. Eventually former Wimbledon player-manager Mike Everitt was appointed as manager, just seven days before the beginning of the season. Everitt made no signings before the first match of the season and inherited a tiny 14-man squad, with backup goalkeeper Gary Towse being Brentford's only incoming transfer, signed two months earlier.", "|Gary Towse", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gary Towse", "| Gary Towse", "| Gary Towse"]}, {"page": "Towse, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Towse"]}]}}
