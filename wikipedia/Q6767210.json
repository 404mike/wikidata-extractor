He made his league debut, whilst still an apprentice, playing as a late substitute in a match against Brighton & Hove Albion in December 1982. He turned professional the following month, but that one appearance was his only game for the Norwich first team.\nCrowe joined Torquay United on a free transfer in July 1985, scoring twice in 57 games for the Gulls, before a move to Cambridge United in December 1986. He played 51 times for Cambridge before moving into non-league football, playing for Watton and Thetford Town before joining Wroxham. In the 1999 close season, Crowe joined Lowestoft Town as player-coach, though notwithstanding a legal challenge from Wroxham who still held his registration, and who Mark still had 2 years left on his contract with. Eventually an FA ruling provided in Lowestoft's favour.\nCrowe joined Kirkley in the 2003 close season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southwold", "response": ["*Mark Crowe (born 1965), professional footballer with over 100 professional appearances"]}, {"page": "Mark Crowe", "response": ["Mark Crowe is an American video game designer, artist, and writer who developed several adventure games, mostly for Sierra On-Line and its subsidiary Dynamix.
