A tax bill potentially running to \u00a349\u00a0million, including interest and penalties, was assessed by HMRC in 2010. The scale of the potential liability led then-chairman Alastair Johnston to admit in 2011 that the club could go out of business and it was a major reason why the club struggled to find a suitable buyer when it was put up for sale in 2009. There was another \u00a32.8\u00a0million tax liability hanging over the club (known as the 'wee tax case') which threatened to prevent any involvement in European football for the following season, although a UEFA licence was eventually granted as the case was still in dispute at the time.", "In late 2012, the SPL set up an investigation, chaired by Lord Nimmo Smith, into alleged use of dual contracts by Rangers through the EBT scheme. David Murray denied any cheating took place during his ownership of Rangers, while Alastair Johnston and Charles Green questioned the independence of the investigation. The enquiry found that Rangers had deliberately failed to disclose the trust payments to withhold information from HMRC and fined the old company \u00a3250,000. It had been anticipated that the investigation would revoke honours won by Rangers during the period between 2001 and 2009 when the trust payments were made (three League titles, four Scottish Cups and four League Cups), but this was not done because it was considered that Rangers had not obtained any sporting advantage by withholding information."]}, {"page": "Ownership of Rangers F.C.", "response": ["|Alastair Johnston"]}, {"page": "List of Rangers F.C. chairmen", "response": ["| Alastair Johnston"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| Alastair Johnston"]}]}}
