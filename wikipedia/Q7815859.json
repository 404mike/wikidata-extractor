However, he went further and authorised the closure of lines, notably the Oxford to Cambridge Line, that even Beeching had not considered closing.In May 1967 he resigned from Parliament to become chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. His resignation paved the way for a by-election which resulted in a historic victory for the Scottish National Party's candidate Winnie Ewing.He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1964. He later served on the Wheatley Commission and was in part responsible for the resulting reforms in Scottish local government.
