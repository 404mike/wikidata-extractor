Of the inherited squad, 11 players departed and only four were retained: Kevin Hector, Alan Durban, Ron Webster and Colin Boulton. Clough also sacked the club secretary, the groundsman and the chief scout, along with two tea ladies he caught laughing after a Derby defeat. With the additional signings of Dave Mackay and Willie Carlin in 1968, Clough and Taylor's management led Derby to become champions of Division Two, establishing the club record of 22 matches without defeat on the way."]}, {"page": "Stoke City F.C.", "response": ["Waddington was replaced by George Eastham in March 1977. However, he could not prevent the club's relegation to the Second Division in 1976\u201377. Eastham left in January 1978 after only ten months in charge, and was replaced by Alan Durban from Shrewsbury Town. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in the 1978\u201379 season, but after consolidating the club's position in the First Division, he left to manage Sunderland in 1981. Richie Barker was appointed for the 1981\u201382 season, but was sacked in December 1983 and was replaced by Bill Asprey.

Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes either, and he too left in April. Alan Durban, previously Stoke's manager two decades earlier, took charge for the remainder of season.

The \u00a3400,000 transfer fee spent on McCoist made him Sunderland's record signing. His time at Sunderland was unsuccessful: McCoist scored only nine goals in 65 appearances for a side struggling at the foot of the English First Division. He only managed two goals during the 1981\u201382 season, his first coming against Nottingham Forest and his second a spectacular curling effort from the edge of the box against Southampton."]}, {"page": "Neville Southall", "response": ["In December 1997, Southall went to Alvin Martin's Southend United of the Second Division on loan. He made 9 appearances in a brief stay at Roots Hall. He joined Chris Kamara's First Division Stoke City in February 1998. Kamara resigned two months later, and caretaker-manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside on his first day in charge to say \"I'll let you manage the reserves, so long as you keep your head down, do whatever I tell you, and I won't tell everybody you're a bad influence\". Southall was shocked by Durban's words and could not explain his attitude. Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions and Everton only avoided relegation on the last day of the season. He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer, and later said \"one of the worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close\"."]}, {"page": "Chris Turner (footballer, born 1958)", "response": ["Ken Knighton led the Rokerites to promotion out of the Second Division in 1979\u201380 \u2013 they finished runners-up, just a point behind champions Leicester City \u2013 with Turner playing 30 of the club's 42 league games as he fended off competition from Barry Siddall. He then featured 31 times as they consolidated their First Division status with a 17th-place finish. New manager Alan Durban then led Sunderland to a 19th-place finish in 1981\u201382, with Turner being limited to only 19 league appearances. He regained his first-team status in the 1982\u201383 season, playing 41 matches as Sunderland posted a 16th-place finish; during the season he managed to keep six clean sheets in a row. Len Ashurst took charge for the end of the 1983\u201384 campaign, and kept faith in Turner, who ended the season with 48 appearances to his name. He featured 53 times across the 1984\u201385 campaign, his last one at Roker Park, as Sunderland were relegated in 21st-place. Sunderland did also make it to the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in 1985, but lost 1\u20130 to Norwich City after Gordon Chisholm deflected Asa Hartford's shot past Turner just after half-time. The campaign did end on a positive note on a personal level for Turner, as supporters voted him the club's Player of the Year."]}, {"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["He underwent an operation to remove cartilage in his knee in November 1975, and his recovery was not entirely successful. He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at \"half pace\". His long-term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground's Butler Street stand, and a lack of adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair; Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 1976\u201377. Following relegation Smith formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 1978\u201379 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were \"boring\", as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too much of a threat for him."]}, {"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["Prior to the start of the 1963\u201364 season, the club saw the departures of several key players, including Hooper and Alan Durban. The signing of fellow Welsh international John Charles had raised hopes of improvement but the side struggled throughout the season, winning just 14 league matches out of 42. Allchurch finished as the club's top league scorer, scoring 12 times including a hat-trick against Sunderland in September 1963. The club's struggles saw George Swindin dismissed as manager and replaced by Jimmy Scoular, who had captained Newcastle during Allchurch's spell in the North-East. Allchurch found Scoular's loud and vocal form of management difficult and in mid-October 1964, found himself dropped from the side after recovering from a brief thigh injury as Scoular favoured playing Peter King in his place. He did not return to the first team until February, during which time he stated his desire to leave the club, when Scoular was forced to recall him after the Bluebirds had suffered a severe decline during his absence. Scoular had introduced a new youth policy within the squad, handing regular places to players such as King, George Johnston and Don Murray. Murray later commented that he regarded it as a privilege to play alongside Allchurch and Charles and stated \"There was a saying among the players, if you are in trouble give it to Ivor\"."]}, {"page": "Ray Kennedy", "response": ["Following the sale of Jimmy Case, Kennedy began to become disillusioned with Liverpool, and was sent off twice in the space of a few weeks early in the 1981\u201382 season \u2013 the first red cards of his career.

His final cup game for the club came eight days later, in a 3\u20130 defeat to Brazilian side Flamengo in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium. He was replaced in the team by Ronnie Whelan. Liverpool went on to win the league title after finishing four points ahead of second-place Ipswich Town, and Kennedy's 15 league appearances in the first half of the campaign were enough to earn him another league championship medal. Sunderland attempted to sign him on loan in January 1982, but were denied by Liverpool, and Kennedy could not agree personal terms with manager Alan Durban so was not signed by Sunderland on a permanent transfer."]}, {"page": "Alec Lindsay", "response": ["He made a good start to his Stoke career converting three penalties in his first five matches for the club under George Eastham. However, with the expectation at the Victoria Ground to gain an instant return to the First Division Eastham was sacked in early January 1978 with the club languishing in mid-table.

However Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from Sunderland to his home in Bolton, and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980\u201381 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team at the start of the 1981\u201382 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from Roker Park inevitable."]}]}}
