He joined Bristol St George before Alex Raisbeck signed him for Bristol City in September 1925, then playing in the Football League Third Division South. Coggins replaced Frank Vallis in goal to make his debut on Boxing Day 1925 in the 2\u20131 win at Southend United. He was an ever-present member of the City side that won the Third Division South title in 1926\u201327, thus gaining promotion to the Second Division. He spent a further three seasons at Ashton Gate making 41 appearances in 1927\u201328, 40 appearances in 1928\u201329 and 26 appearances in 1929\u201330 before losing his place to George Newlands. Bristol City only just avoided relegation finishing 20th in both 1928\u201329 and 1929\u201330.

Sutherland joined Millwall in July 1920 and made his debut in their first ever League match. Alex Raisbeck signed Sutherland in August 1922 for Bristol City. Sutherland joined Merthyr Town in May 1926 along with Frank Vallis."]}, {"page": "James Crumley (footballer)", "response": ["Crumley joined Bristol City, newly promoted to the Second Division for 1923\u201324, as a backup to Frank Vallis. By 13 October, with Bristol City already bottom of the table and both Vallis and Robert Goddard already tried in goal, Crumley made his debut in a 1\u20131 draw with Southampton. According to the Western Daily Press, he had nothing to do, so \"we [had] yet to learn\u00a0... how good he is when asked to meet League requirements\". He kept his place for the next match, a 1\u20130 defeat to Fulham, in which he exhibited a tendency to rush off his line when he should not, but that was his last appearance in the League side."]}]}}
