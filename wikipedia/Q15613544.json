As a result, he taught English at the University of Tehran, and married Afkham Darbandi, about whom he has since written and published many love poems, in 1974.\nAfter the Islamic Revolution turned Dick and Afkham Davis into refugees, first in the United Kingdom and then in the United States, Davis decided to begin translating many of the greatest masterpieces of both ancient and modern Persian poetry into English.\nDavis is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and has been called, by The Times Literary Supplement, \"our finest translator from Persian.\" Davis' original poetry has been just as highly praised.\nDavis' poetry collections have been chosen as books of the year by The Sunday Times (UK) in 1989; The Daily Telegraph (UK) in 1989; The Economist (UK) in 2002; The Washington Post in 2010, and The Times Literary Supplement (UK) in 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shahnameh", "response": ["For many years, the Moscow edition was the standard text. In 1977, an early 1217 manuscript was rediscovered in Florence. The 1217 Florence manuscript is one of the earliest known copies of the Shahnameh, predating the Moghul invasion and the following destruction of important libraries and manuscript collections. Using it as the chief text, Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh began the preparation of a new critical edition in 1990. The number of manuscripts that were consulted during the preparation of Khaleghi-Motlagh edition goes beyond anything attempted by the Moscow team. The critical apparatus is extensive and a large number of variants for many parts of the poem were recorded. The last volume was published in 2008, bringing the eight-volume enterprise to a completion. According to Dick Davis, professor of Persian at Ohio State University, it is \"by far the best edition of the Shahnameh available, and it is surely likely to remain such for a very long time\".", "There have been a number of English translations, almost all abridged.

Between 1905 and 1925, the brothers Arthur and Edmond Warner published a translation of the complete work in nine volumes, now out of print.  There are also modern incomplete translations of the Shahnameh: Reuben Levy's 1967 prose version (later revised by Amin Banani), and another by Dick Davis in a mixture of poetry and prose which appeared in 2006.

It would be hard to confuse Murphy with any other contemporary poet. No one else writing poetry in English sounds quite like him.\" Gerry Cambridge founded the Scottish literary journal The Dark Horse. As poet Dick Davis has noted, this distinctive style owes much to Murphy's use of traditional meter and rhyme, unusual among poets today: \"His poems are wholly his own, and yet the voice in them lives in and through his mastery of traditional metre, which is so thorough as to seem indivisible from the poems' sensibility and meaning.\"  This focus on rhyme and meter is exemplified in the following excerpt from \"Harvest of Sorrows\":"]}, {"page": "Dick Davis", "response": ["Dick Davis may refer to:", "* Dick Davis (musician) (1917\u20131954), American tenor saxophonist who played with Eddie Calhoun", "* Dick Davis (politician) (1921\u20131999), Lieutenant Governor of Virginia", "* Dick Davis (defensive end) (born 1938), American football defensive end", "* Dick Davis (running back) (born 1946), American football running back", "* Dick Davis (translator) (born 1945), British translator", "* Dick Davis (baseball) (born 1953), American baseball player"]}, {"page": "Fatemeh Shams", "response": ["Fatemeh Shams earned her doctorate from Oxford University in year 2015 as a Clarendon Scholar in the field of Oriental Studies.

Nor does he stand in the very first rank of American poets. His poetry was just peaking when he died. Yet Finlay's poetry contains here and there lines and passages at that high level. Because he wrote five or six major poems and twenty or more others close to this level, he ranks certainly among the first five or six poets of the American South, and likewise of the post-World War II generation. At the same time, he was one of the most brilliant literary essayists of the last decades of his century. He has indeed earned a place in American letters.\"Goodman, Jeffrey (2000). \"The Romance of Modern Classicism: Remarks on the Life and Work of John Finlay, 1941-1991\".
