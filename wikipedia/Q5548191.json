This was, however, a long way short of Georgie Mee's record of 195 consecutive league appearances for the club. Pashley spent a large portion of the season up front alongside Dave Bamber, and scored three league goals (two from the penalty spot). He also helped put Blackpool into the second round of the FA Cup by scoring in their first-round victory at Horwich R.M.I. He also scored two goals in the League Cup.Calley, Roy (1992).
