He was educated at Catholic University School, at Trinity College, Dublin and at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. He afterwards studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, then ceased active involvement in medicine after he joined Isaac Butt's Home Rule League in 1873, winning notice in 1879 when he attacked Butt's weak parliamentary handling of Irish Home Rule.

She made her first political reference on 25 February 1883 when she noted the arrest of the Invincibles, and she then regularly commented on land reform. She travelled to Ireland for the first time in August 1886, staying in Killiney, County Dublin. In October 1886, she met John Dillon, and began to follow the Plan of Campaign so that she could discuss it with him during his visits to the Mathew house in London. During this time, John Dillon was deeply immersed in politics, and was imprisoned on a number of occasions. Being a careful follower of Irish politics, she became an anti-Parnellite. She confronted John Dillon in autumn 1895 about their relationship, saying that they could no longer meet as they had become the subject of gossip. He proposed within two weeks, and they were married on 21 November 1895 in Brompton Oratory. They were busy and often apart, with John having spend time in a warm climate due to his ill health. Dillon tried to accompany him when she could, but the couple's large family made that difficult. They had one daughter and five sons, John Dillon (1896-1970), Anne Elizabeth Dillon (born 29 Oct 1897), Theobald Wolfe Tone (1898-1946), Myles, James, and Brian. Finances were strained until John's uncle Charles bequeathed him his house, 2 North Great George's Street, Dublin in 1898, and a business  in Ballaghadereen, County Mayo was bequeathed him by a cousin, Anne Deane, in 1905. Dillon  ran the business successfully, while also carrying out duties as a politician's wife such as opening the Belfast ladies' branch of the United Irish League in June 1905. Her busy life resulted in her neglecting her diary."]}]}}
