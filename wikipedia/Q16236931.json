During the second half De Girolamo equalised with a 15-yard shot, and AFC Wimbledon scored two goals in quick succession through Sean Rigg and Matt Tubbs, before Zubar scored for York from a few yards out to finish the scoring. Halliday made his senior debut in this match, and was named man of the match with an impressive performance at right-back, before his loan was extended until 17 January 2015. Cameron Murray was loaned to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Frickley Athletic, where he made only one start during a one-month period. York went 2\u20130 down after 62 minutes when playing away against Bury, but fought back to draw 2\u20132 with Hyde scoring a header from a Coulson cross before Summerfield equalised with a 20-yard free kick. York achieved their first home win of the season by beating Accrington Stanley 1\u20130, meaning the club record of most home consecutive matches without a win, set at 14 in 1981\u201382, was not equalled. The winning goal was scored in the 35th minute by Lowe with a header from Coulson's cross. This was followed by a 3\u20130 away victory over Carlisle United, marking the first time York had achieved successive wins in 2014\u201315. Josh Carson scored shortly before half-time from Fletcher's flick on, and in the second half Summerfield scored with a curling shot from 20\u00a0yards before Coulson shot into the top corner.", "|Cameron Murray", "|Cameron Murray", "!scope=row|Cameron Murray "]}, {"page": "Cameron Lochiel Murray", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cameron Murray (footballer)"]}]}}
