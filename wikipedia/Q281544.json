Gawain appears as a supporting character in films such as Knights of the Round Table (1953, played by Robert Urquhart) and Excalibur (1981, played by Liam Neeson), all of which draw on elements of Gawain's traditional characterizations.Blanch & Wasserman, p. 185. Other films give Gawain a larger role. In the 1954 adaptation of Prince Valiant, he is a somewhat boorish, though noble and good-natured, foil for his squire and friend, Valiant.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 187\u201388. He plays his traditional part in the 1963 film Sword of Lancelot (played by George Baker), seeking revenge when Lancelot kills his unarmed brother Gareth, but ultimately coming to Lancelot's aid when he uncovers Mordred's responsibility.Williams, p. 386. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight has been adapted to film several times, including 1973's Gawain and the Green Knight (played by Murray Head) and 1984's Sword of the Valiant (played by Miles O'Keeffe), both directed by Stephen Weeks; neither film was well reviewed and both deviate substantially from the source material.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 190\u201391 A 1991 television adaptation by Thames Television, Gawain and the Green Knight, was both more faithful and better received.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 191\u201393. Other film portrayals included Robert Gwyn Davin's in First Knight (1995), Anthony Hickox in Prince Valiant (1997), Sebastian Roch\u00e9 in Merlin (1998), Noah Huntley in The Mists of Avalon (2001), and Joel Edgerton in King Arthur (2004). In the 2008 television series Merlin, Gawain appears as Sir Gwaine, played by Eoin Macken. Though of noble origin, he passes himself as a peasant due to his mother's mistreatment by the king his father served; he is finally knighted by Arthur due to his personal value. In the 2011 series Camelot, he is played by Clive Standen. In 2020's Cursed, Gawain is played by Matt Stokoe, who doubles as the Green Knight. In the 2021 film The Green Knight, Gawain is portrayed by Dev Patel."]}, {"page": "28 Days Later", "response": ["* Noah Huntley as Mark"]}, {"page": "2001 in film", "response": ["| The Mists of Avalon || TNT / Constantin Film / Stillking Films / Wolper Organization || Uli Edel (director); Gavin Scott (screenplay); Anjelica Huston, Julianna Margulies, Joan Allen, Samantha Mathis, Edward Atterton, Michael Vartan, Caroline Goodall, Michael Byrne, Hans Matheson, Mark Lewis Jones, Clive Russell, Biddy Hodson, Ian Duncan, Tamsin Egerton, Freddie Highmore, Christopher Fulford, David Calder, Hugh Ross, Edward Jewesbury, Noah Huntley, Karel Dobr\u00fd, Kl\u00e1ra Issov\u00e1, Tony Curran || Drama, Fantasy || Live action"]}, {"page": "2003 in film", "response": ["| 28 Days Later || Fox Searchlight Pictures || Danny Boyle (director); Alex Garland (screenplay); Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Noah Huntley, Christopher Eccleston, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Burns, Stuart McQuarrie, Ricci Harnett, Leo Bill, Luke Mably, Jukka Hiltunen, David Schneider, Toby Sedgwick, Junior Laniyan, Ray Panthaki, Sanjay Rambaruth, Marvin Campbell, Alex Palmer, Bindu De Stoppani, Christopher Dunne, Emma Hitching || Horror || || Live Action"]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| Event Horizon || Paramount Pictures || Paul W.

They spend the day flirting with each other and then, at the end of the day, she and Griffin get it on in his office - even though she's married! Connie then literally leaves him in his underpants saying, 'Oh by the way, I'm your boss, so don't be late tomorrow!' That's the sort of woman she is!\" Connie goes on to begin a flirtation with her Registrar, Will Curtis, although their initial professional relationship is a strained one, with Mealing offering the insight: \"being a military boy, he finds it difficult to take orders from a woman so they have a complete headlock.\" The two characters later share a kiss, although this is the extent of their romantic involvement. Mealing describes the event as follows: \"Connie insists that Will goes along to Ric Griffin's 50th and when he arrives, he finds Connie, usually suited and stern, completely transformed. She pulls out all the stops to seduce him - and he finally gives in. [After they kiss] Connie walks off saying \"I just needed to know I could have you\". She does it to remind him who's in charge. In someway she does like him but she has to say no for now\". Mealing's relationship with co-star Noah Huntley was markedly different off-screen, with the actress explaining: \"Sometimes it's hard and I have to apologise for relentlessly going on at him.

She clashes with registrar Will Curtis (Noah Huntley), and actively belittles and berates him, taking particular offense at the discovery he is a Lord. This soon develops into tormenting him on a more personal level, for instance ordering him to go for a drink with her instead of disciplining him professionally in the episode \"Letting Go\". The tension between the pair grows, culminating in the episode \"Thicker Than Water\" when Connie kisses him at Ric's 50th birthday party, before informing him she just needed to know she could have him, and walking away."]}, {"page": "Our Lady of Sion School", "response": ["* Noah Huntley, actor"]}, {"page": "Holby City (series 6)", "response": ["*Noah Huntley as Will Curtis (from episode 29)"]}, {"page": "Holby City (series 7)", "response": ["*Noah Huntley as Will Curtis (until episode 25)"]}, {"page": "List of The Chronicles of Narnia (film series) cast members", "response": ["|William MoseleyNoah Huntley "]}, {"page": "Megiddo: The Omega Code 2", "response": ["* Noah Huntley as Stone Alexander (age 21)"]}, {"page": "List of Shooting Stars episodes", "response": ["|Martin Clunes and Noah Huntley"]}, {"page": "List of 28 Days Later characters", "response": ["Mark (played by Noah Huntley) was a young man who lived in London with his parents and sister.
