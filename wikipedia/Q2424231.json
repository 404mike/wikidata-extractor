In 1960 Sir Peter Medawar wrote to Gibson giving \"deep obligation\" to him for paving the way for his understanding which led to Medawar being awarded the Nobel prize for Medicine in 1960.

Acland", "response": ["Acland applied for and received two years of funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to improve the instruments used in microsurgery. It was unusual for surgical trainees to receive MRC funding, and Acland suspected that the Scottish plastic surgeon Thomas Gibson may have played a part in approving his application. With this funding he returned to London Hospital in 1970, where he improved the tiny needles and thread used in microsurgery, invented the \"Acland micro vessel clamp,\" and investigated how to prevent microthrombosis. He developed smaller needles and thread for microsurgery, making them himself. Acland realized that he needed to commercialize the process and initially approached Ethicon, then the largest suture manufacturer in Britain, with a proposal to do so. They thought microsurgery sutures would not sell well and turned him down. Acland then turned to Springler and Tritt, a startup suture company in southern Germany. Acland then trained as a registrar in plastic surgery at Canniesburn Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, from 1972 to 1975."]}]}}
