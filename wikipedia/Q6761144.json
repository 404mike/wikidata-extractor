The club had been set up by Maria Dickin in 1934, and after Blyton publicised its existence in the Enid Blyton Magazine it attracted 100,000 members in three years. Such was Blyton's popularity among children that after she became Queen Bee in 1952 more than 20,000 additional members were recruited in her first year in office. The Enid Blyton Magazine Club was formed in 1953. Its primary objective was to raise funds to help those children with cerebral palsy who attended a centre in Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea, London, by furnishing an on-site hostel among other things."]}, {"page": "1951", "response": ["* March 1 \u2013 Maria Dickin, British social reformer (b. 1870)"]}, {"page": "St Augustine Watling Street", "response": ["The church cat, named Faith, became quite well known after the air raid which destroyed St Augustine's.
