Fairbairn was an Australian graduate of Cambridge, with boundless charisma and innovative (and highly controversial) views on training and technique.  He was one of the major influences on the club and on the sport in general, becoming generally accepted as the father of modern rowing.  Under his tutelage in the 1920s, and that of Julius Beresford, Thames reached new heights.  Fairbairn left the club for London Rowing Club in 1925.  The precise reasons are unclear but undoubtedly a clash with Julius Beresford was partly at the root: the two coaches, despite holding similar views on technique, were unable to get on.  Under Beresford, Thames won four events at Henley in both 1927 and 1928, something which no club replicated in the 20th century.", "| Julius Beresford"]}, {"page": "Jack Beresford", "response": ["Jack Beresford was the son of Julius Beresford.

Jack was educated at Bedford School where he stroked the eight and also captained the rugby football XV. During the First World War he served in the Liverpool Scottish Regiment and was wounded in the leg in France. He returned to London and learned the craft of furniture-making for Beresford & Hicks in his father's factory. He took up sculling because the leg wound put an end to his rugby career. Throughout his competitive career, Beresford (like his father and his brother, Eric Beresford) represented Thames Rowing Club.
