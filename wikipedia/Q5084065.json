Thus opened a fully-fledged crisis, the Shell Crisis. The prime minister's wife correctly identified her husband's chief opponent, the Press baron, and owner of The Times, Lord Northcliffe: \"I'm quite sure Northcliffe is at the bottom of all this,\" but failed to recognise the clandestine involvement of Sir John French, who leaked the details of the shells shortage to Repington. Northcliffe claimed that \"the whole question of the supply of the munitions of war is one on which the Cabinet cannot be arraigned too sharply.\" Attacks on the government and on Asquith's personal lethargy came from the left as well as the right, C.

Haig did not approve of the Northcliffe press attacks on Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill (despite the fact that Kitchener had played a role in planning the Gallipoli expedition and was an opponent of the strong General Staff which Haig wanted to see). French had been leaking information about the shell shortage to Charles \u00e0 Court Repington of The Times, whom Haig detested and which he likened to \"carrying on with a whore\" (possibly a deliberately chosen analogy in view of French's womanising). French also communicated with Conservative leaders and to David Lloyd George who now became Minister of Munitions in the new coalition government.Groot 1988, p. 193."]}, {"page": "World war", "response": ["The term \"first world war\" was first used in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, who claimed that \"there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'\u00a0... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word\", citing a wire service report in The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914. In English, the term \"First World War\" had been used by Charles \u00e0 Court Repington, as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of Harvard University in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.The First World War Quite Interesting Ltd.

The Cabinet was bickering and some members plotted against others. Churchill himself aimed to replace Sir Edward Grey as Foreign Secretary with Balfour. The historian Stephen Koss has argued that Churchill himself created the Shell Crisis. He states that during a visit to BEF Headquarters on 8 May he arranged with Colonel Charles \u00e0 Court Repington, the Times correspondent there to publish the reports of the lack of shells.Journal of Modern History Volume 40, No 2, page 357. James discounts this argument. On 15 May Fisher resigned as First Sea Lord. He presented the Cabinet with a list of demands; if these were satisfied he would return to office. The first of these was that Churchill would be dismissed from Cabinet altogether. Fisher's demands were extreme, the King saying that Fisher should be hung from the yardarm,Kenneth Rose King George V p. 189 but his resignation precipitated a Cabinet crisis.That Fisher's resignation, rather than the Shell Crisis, did so is shown by Lord Beaverbrook Politicians and the War Vol 1 p. 142"]}, {"page": "Ian Nish", "response": ["** Volume 5:   The War in the Far East (1905) by Charles \u00e0 Court Repington.

These raised the spectre of a surprise 'bolt out of the blue' attack which could evade naval interception. Invasion fears were also stoked by the alarmist rhetoric of former Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, Lord Roberts. He argued that reliance on a naval defence was complacent, and that Germany's modern rail and sea facilities would allow it to land 20,000 troops within an hour. His cause was echoed in The Times by Colonel Charles \u00e0 Court Repington, who called for an expansion of the Territorial Force to 800,000 men.Mitchinson 2005 pp. 4, 6, 9\u201310 International tension in 1909 inflamed fears further, and the play An Englishman's Home generated 30,000 new recruits in seven weeks for the Territorial Force. It was a temporary boost, and from a peak of over 268,000 that year, the force declined to just under 246,000 men by September 1913, less than 80 per cent of establishment. As well as failing to attract sufficient new recruits, the force failed to retain large numbers of men after their initial enlistment expired.Beckett 2011 p. 221 In 1910, Lord Esher, chairman of the London County Territorial Association, wrote in the National Review that the country would have to choose between an under-strength voluntary auxiliary and conscription.Simkins p. 17"]}, {"page": "Romanian military equipment of World War I", "response": ["Between 1914 and 1916, 59 Romanian factories along with numerous private contractors produced a total of 400,000 artillery rounds and 45 million small-arms cartridges.
