His description of its writing is probably exaggerated, though the essay serves as an important overview of Poe's literary theory.Krutch, 98 He explains that every component of the poem is based on logic: the raven enters the chamber to avoid a storm (the \"midnight dreary\" in the \"bleak December\"), and its perch on a pallid white bust was to create visual contrast against the dark black bird. No aspect of the poem was an accident, he claims, but is based on total control by the author.Silverman, 295\u2013296 Even the term \"Nevermore\", he says, is used because of the effect created by the long vowel sounds (though Poe may have been inspired to use the word by the works of Lord Byron or Henry Wadsworth Longfellow).Forsythe, 439\u2013452 Poe had experimented with the long o sound throughout many other poems: \"no more\" in \"Silence\", \"evermore\" in \"The Conqueror Worm\". The topic itself, Poe says, was chosen because \"the death... of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.\" Told from \"the lips\u00a0... of a bereaved lover\" is best suited to achieve the desired effect. Beyond the poetics of it, the lost Lenore may have been inspired by events in Poe's own life as well, either to the early loss of his mother, Eliza Poe, or the long illness endured by his wife, Virginia. Ultimately, Poe considered \"The Raven\" an experiment to \"suit at once the popular and critical taste\", accessible to both the mainstream and high literary worlds. It is unknown how long Poe worked on \"The Raven\"; speculation ranges from a single day to ten years. Poe recited a poem believed to be an early version with an alternate ending of \"The Raven\" in 1843 in Saratoga, New York. An early draft may have featured an owl.Weiss, 185"]}, {"page": "Annabel Lee", "response": ["It is unclear on whom the eponymous character Annabel Lee is based.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 401.

Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 149.  Biographers often interpret that \"Annabel Lee\" was written for Poe's wife Virginia, who had died two years prior, as was suggested by poet Frances Sargent Osgood, though Osgood is herself a candidate for the poem's inspiration. A strong case can be made for Poe's wife Virginia: She was the one he loved as a child, the only one who had been his bride, and the only one who had died.Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 244.  Autobiographical readings of the poem have also been used to support the theory that Virginia and Poe never consummated their marriage, as \"Annabel Lee\" was a \"maiden\".Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 27.  Critics, including T. O.

This reveals the speaker's dependence on Ulalume and her love; his losing her leaves him not only sad but absolutely devastated and, by visiting her grave, he unconsciously subjects himself to further self-inflicted anguish.Kennedy, J. Gerald. \"Poe, 'Ligeia,' and the Problem of Dying Women\" collected in New Essays on Poe's Major Tales, edited by Kenneth Silverman. Cambridge University Press, 1993: 117.  The poem has a heavy focus on decay and deterioration: the leaves are \"withering\" and the narrator's thoughts are \"palsied\".Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1992: 336.  Like many of Poe's later poems, \"Ulalume\" has a strong sense of rhythm and musicality.Peeples, Scott.

"]}, {"page": "The Philosophy of Composition", "response": ["The essay states Poe's conviction that a work of fiction should be written only after the author has decided how it is to end and which emotional response, or \"effect\", he wishes to create, commonly known as the \"unity of effect\".  Once this effect has been determined, the writer should decide all other matters pertaining to the composition of the work, including tone, theme, setting, characters, conflict, and plot. In this case, Poe logically decides on \"the death... of a beautiful woman\" as it \"is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.\" Some commentators have taken this to imply that pure poetry can only be attained by the eradication of female beauty.Kennedy, J.
