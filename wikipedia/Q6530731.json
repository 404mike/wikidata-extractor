Piloting a Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b, he shot down one of the first fighters with a synchronized gun when he destroyed a Fokker Eindekker on 19 July.

Leslie Court was one of his observer gunners during these missions. Webb was invalided home in September, where he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 4 October, and  then posted to a squadron in England, where he acted as instructor, and for a time as a squadron commander.
