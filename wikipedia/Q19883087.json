It was later revealed that \u00a329 million of shares that should have been distributed to ordinary workers through the employee ownership scheme (REBTL) had been transferred to Tim Ingram Hill, one of the management team. Tim Warwick, who worked as Roadchef's company secretary at the time of the transfer, blew the whistle on the transfer. A prolonged legal battle ensued, the courts declaring the transaction void and ordering Mr Ingram Hill to repay the profit he made from the shares he appropriated. Subsequently, the trustees of the scheme discovered that \u00a310 million had been paid in tax on the appropriated shares by Mr Ingram Hill. This was recovered by the trustees, as the transfer had been declared legally void. However, HMRC continued to insist that a large amount of tax should be paid by the trustees, as the shares were in the possession of Mr Ingram Hill in 2003, when the government passed legislation to make such employee share schemes tax-free. The trustees argued that the shares should not be taxed in any distribution to the ordinary workers, as the scheme clearly would have been included in the tax-free category, had Mr Ingram Hill not appropriated the shares for his own gain. The simple solution of retrospectively adding the Roadchef employee benefit scheme to the list of tax-free schemes was also pointed out by the trustees. It was reported in July 2019 by the Emloyee Benefit Trust's trustee that the ongoing dispute with HMRC is the only remaining obstacle to the distribution of the money to the ordinary workers, and that the current Roadchef management have been fully supportive of the process.http://www.esopcentre.com/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2019/06/newspad-July-2019-1.pdf An Early Day Motion was tabled in Parliament in September 2019 by Neil Gray MP, who has campaigned extensively on behalf of the staff, criticising HMRC for failing to resolve the dispute. Neil Gray raised the issue once again during Prime Minister's Questions in Parliament in January 2020, in response to which, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that he would ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to \"discuss the matter.\" Several other MPs have added their support to a tax-free distribution of the money, including Dr Julian Lewis MP, David Mundell MP, Martyn Day MP, and Jessica Morden MP. As of September 2020, due to the dispute with HMRC, the money has still not been distributed to the staff who should have received it."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish National Party MPs", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Day, Martyn\"| Martyn Day"]}, {"page": "Linlithgow", "response": ["In the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster, Linlithgow has been represented as part of the Linlithgow and East Falkirk constituency since 2005.
