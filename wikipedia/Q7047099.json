He was encouraged to move by music entrepreneur Ivor Schlosberg, who hired Rabin to kick start the English branch of his production company, Blue Chip Music, and become its first producer. By July, Rabin had struck a recording deal with Chrysalis Records which, in September 1978, reissued his debut solo album under the name Trevor Rabin. The album was remixed at Wessex Sound Studios in London and released with some new tracks and in a different track order. Billboard magazine gave a positive review: \"An impressive outing marked by a rock style that invites comparisons to Boston at times or a Tom Petty\" with \"explosive\" keyboards and guitars. Later in 1978, Rabin produced, performed on, and arranged Noel McCalla's debut album, Night Time Emotion (1979).", "Wolf, Rabin's third solo album for Chrysalis, released in 1980, was co-produced with Ray Davies. Recorded at Konk Studios in London, Rabin provided lead vocals, guitars, and keyboards while using various musicians to contribute, including drummer Simon Phillips, bassists Jack Bruce and Mo Foster, keyboardists Mann and John Bundrick, and Chris Thompson and Noel McCalla on additional vocals. Following its release, Rabin severed ties with Chrysalis as he felt the label did little to promote the album. During this time, Rabin played guitars on \"Runner\" and a rendition of \"Redemption Song\" by Bob Marley for Manfred Mann's Earth Band's album Somewhere in Afrika (1983)."]}, {"page": "Manfred Mann's Earth Band", "response": ["Manfred Mann's Earth Band was revived in 1991 with a lineup of Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers, Steve Kinch, singer Noel McCalla and former Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker and resumed recording, covering tracks by artists as varied as Paul Weller, Robert Cray, Del Amitri and The Lovin' Spoonful. Mann has also released solo projects, including Plains Music, which was based on Native American music, and 2006, which includes collaborations with the German rapper Thomas D and tracks featuring the music of, amongst others, the Super Furry Animals.", "The Earth Band has had a fluctuating line-up, with Mann being the only continuous member.

Vocalist/guitarist Chris Thompson returned in 1996 to sing alongside Mick Rogers and Noel McCalla until 1999 (then again in 2004, briefly).

He did not know many potential candidates, and invited drummer Simon Phillips to play based on his reputation and his capability of handling the \"very fast and furious\" parts, yet unsure of his approach for simple beats. In a rehearsal session, Rutherford recalled that the drummer demonstrated he could handle all the material after the first few bars had been played. Despite planning a rehearsal period of three weeks, Rutherford said it was cut short to three days as Phillips had learnt the parts quickly. Rutherford also enlisted his longtime friend and original Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips on keyboards, who had taken further music and piano lessons since his departure from the band in 1970. Rutherford felt he was an obvious choice as his style complemented his songwriting. With the addition of Morris Pert on percussion, the backing tracks were put down prior to the lead vocals. Rutherford deemed his voice unsuitable for singing, and sought a vocalist. The original plan was to have Chris Thompson from Manfred Mann's Earth Band do the vocals, but Rutherford thought his voice was too well known and the singer was unavailable due to other commitments. Rutherford then acquired Noel McCalla of Sniff 'n' the Tears who was once considered as the replacement for Genesis singer and frontman Peter Gabriel after he left the group in 1975. Rutherford played all lead and bass guitars on the album which included an acoustic 6-string Ovation, an electric 12-string Alvarez, his custom made Shergold double neck bass, a Fender Stratocaster for lead parts, an Ibanez, and a Roland guitar synthesiser, from which he acquired a string sound that reminded him of a Polymoog synthesiser.

Although members of the band had included two session musicians from New Zealand, Frank Gibson Jr. on drums and Bruce Lynch on bass, the band was also a springboard for a generation of young British musicians, including Chris Fletcher on percussion, Henry Thomas on bass, Gary Husband on drums, Rob Burns on bass, Claire Hamill and Carol Kenyon on vocals (both on whom appeared with Dick Morrissey on the 1981 Jon & Vangelis album The Friends of Mr Cairo), Tessa Niles, Linda Taylor, and Noel McCalla."]}, {"page": "Driver's Seat", "response": ["The genesis of the song dates back to 1973 and a demo tape recorded for a French record label by singer/guitarist Paul Roberts for the band Ashes of Moon.

When he returned in 1984, he shared vocal and guitar duties with Chris Thompson until Thompson's exit. The band effectively stopped existing after the release of Masque in 1987 but a new formation was formed in the early 1990s. Chris Thompson's parts and several new songs were now sung by Noel McCalla, whereas Rogers mostly only sang lead on \"Father of Day, Father of Night\", \"Joybringer\" and some verses on \"Spirits in the Night\" and \"Mighty Quinn\". This pattern did not change through further line-ups; Rogers is once again the band's main guitarist (current vocalist Robert Hart intermittently plays guitar) but never sings more than a handful of vocal parts, which in recent times have typically included a stripped-down version of \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\"."]}]}}
