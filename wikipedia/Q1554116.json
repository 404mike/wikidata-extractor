After 16 years in the top flight, Cherno More was relegated in 1976 and won promotion the following season.  A new generation of players was emerging. Defenders Todor Marev and Ivan Ivanov, midfielders Todor Atanasov and Ivan Andreev, forwards Rafi Rafiev and Nikola Spasov left many good memories in the late 70s and the 80s. In the 1981\u201382 season, the team finished 4th and therefore qualified for the Intertoto Cup. Cherno More won twice 2\u20130 at home against Standard Li\u00e8ge and the Danes from Hvidovre IF and drew 1\u20131 against Bayer 04 Leverkusen.

Hinton spent four years at Forest between 1963 and 1967 before Clough signed him for \u00a330,000. Forest had seen Hinton as a fairly uninspiring player and a number of Forest directors were known to have smugly put it about that Derby would, \"soon be asking for their money back\". They were proved wrong when Hinton played 253 times for the Rams over the next 8 years, scoring 63 goals and winning two League Titles. Other Forest to Derby transfers in the late 60s/early 70s saw Terry Hennessey join Derby directly from Forest and Henry Newton  and Frank Wignall make the move after spells with Everton and  Wolves respectively in between.
