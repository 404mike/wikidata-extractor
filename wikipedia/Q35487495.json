However, the Brexit Party support decreased over time, and in the run-up to the 2019 general election, which took place in December, some analysts thought that the large Conservative majority made victory there unlikely. Farage later announced that the Brexit Party would not stand in any constituency won by the Conservatives in 2017; the Brexit Party candidate was going to be Jonathan Bullock, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East Midlands constituency. UKIP did not stand in the constituency; they only stood in 44 out of the 650 British seats at the election. In the election, held on 12 December, the Conservatives increased their majority further, winning 76.7% of the vote.
