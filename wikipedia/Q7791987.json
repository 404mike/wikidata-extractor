In his time he was noted as a chronologer and was an opponent in controversy of Scaliger. He is now considered, albeit in a very different type of theory, to have provided in 1605 a clear suggestion of an oval orbit in astronomy, anticipating Johannes Kepler, with whom he also had a controversial exchange relating to chronology.His contemporaries ranked him with Joseph Mede and Francis Bacon. His ultimate poverty, certainly exaggerated, furnished Samuel Johnson with an allusion in his poem on the Vanity of Human Wishes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Lamphire", "response": ["Lamphire had a good collection of books and manuscripts, but some of them were burnt in April 1650 by a fire in his house. He owned thirty-eight manuscripts of the works of Thomas Lydiat, which he had bound in twenty-two volumes, and he published one of them, Canones Chronologici (Oxford, 1675), He also published two works by Dr. Hugh Lloyd, the grammarian, in one volume, entitled Phrases Elegantiores et Dictata, Oxford, 1654 (Bodleian). To the second edition (1661) of his friend John Masters's Monarchia Britannica, an oration given in New College Chapel on 6 April 1642 (1st edition 1661), Lamphire added an oration by Henry Savile. He is also said to have published Quaestiones in Logica, Ethica, et Metaphysica (Oxford, 1680) by Robert Pink or Pinck, and he edited Henry Wotton's Plausus et Vota ad Regem de Scotia reducem in Monarchia (Oxford, 1681). He was an executor to Jasper Mayne, and with Robert South put a stone over his grave in Christ Church Cathedral."]}, {"page": "Alkerton, Oxfordshire", "response": ["Early in the 17th century the rector, the mathematician Thomas Lydiat, had the chancel rebuilt in the Perpendicular Gothic style. In 1889 the architect JA Cossins restored the church building and added an organ chamber south of the tower and east of the south aisle. St Michael's is now a Grade I listed building.  The tower has a chime of four bells but they are not currently ringable. The oldest bell was cast in about 1400 and another was cast in 1618.  St Michael's is now one of eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Ironstone Benefice.", "Thomas Lydiat was descended from Christopher Lydiat of London, who bought Alkerton manor house in 1567. Thomas Lydiat became rector of Alkerton in 1612 and had the rectory built in 1625.  By 1624 Alkerton had a watermill, presumably on Sor Brook. It was absent from village records by 1778.  An open field system prevailed in the parish until 1777, when an Act of Parliament was passed for its common lands to be enclosed."]}, {"page": "Lydiat, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Lydiat"]}, {"page": "William Taswell", "response": ["The son of a merchant, Taswell was born at Cowes. He went up to Christ Church, Oxford on 8 July 1670, gaining his B.A. in 1674, M.A. in 1677, B.D. in 1685 and D.D. in 1698. While there he had a beneficial relationship with the Dean, John Fell, who offered him financial support knowing that he received little financial support from his father. In exchange he assisted Fell in manuscript work, for example translating Thomas Lydiat's Chronological Canons into Latin. In 1681, he was appointed college lecturer in Greek."]}]}}
