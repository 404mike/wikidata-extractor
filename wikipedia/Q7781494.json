He subsequently joined League Two side Accrington Stanley on loan two months later. Whalley made his debut for the club in the 1\u20132 defeat to Hartlepool United at the Crown Ground. However, two weeks later, he was sent off in the Football League Trophy match against Doncaster Rovers following a high tackle on Theo Streete, although Accrington manager John Coleman felt that the challenge was not deserving of a red card. The subsequent suspension meant that Whalley spent almost a month out of the side before returning in late December in the loss to Bristol Rovers. He made his transfer to Accrington permanent in January 2007, signing a two-year contract with the club, and the following week he scored a late winner in the 3\u20132 victory over Mansfield Town, his first goal for the team. Whalley remained a first-team regular for the rest of the 2006\u201307 season and retained his place in the starting line-up throughout most of the following season, and scored his first Accrington goal away from the Crown Ground in the 8\u20132 loss at Peterborough United on 15 January 2008. Whalley made a total of 51 league appearances for Accrington, scoring 5 goals, but in May 2008, he was one of 10 players released by the club."]}, {"page": "2018 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|DF ||16||  Theo Streete"]}]}}
