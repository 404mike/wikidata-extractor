During the period between his application and course interview, the Welsh nationalist group Meibion Glynd\u0175r launched an arson attack on English-owned holiday homes in Wales. Jenkins attended an interview for the course in February 1980, during which he disclosed his previous activities with the MAC and time in prison. He was rejected from the course, despite receiving approval from the subject tutors. He later discovered that the decision had been vetoed by the University Committee, led by Robert Walter Steel, who falsely claimed that he had been involved in the Meibion Glynd\u0175r attack. An irate Jenkins gave a television interview the following month to Nationwide in which he discussed the attack. This, coupled with an anonymous note claiming responsibility for the attack that was signed by someone claiming to be from the MAC, led Jenkins to be one of numerous people arrested as part of Operation T\u00e2n. He was later released without charge."]}, {"page": "1983 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Professor Robert Walter Steel, lately Principal, University College of Swansea."]}, {"page": "Steel (surname)", "response": ["*Robert Walter Steel (1915\u20131997), Professor of Geography at Liverpool University and Principal of the University College of Swansea"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 1997", "response": ["*Robert Walter Steel, 82, British geographer."]}]}}
