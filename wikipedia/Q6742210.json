Linfield fielded relatively few Catholic players prior to the 1980s, which led to an accusation that the club held a policy of not signing Catholic players \u2013 similar to Scottish team, Rangers. However, the existence of such a policy has been disputed by some, including well-known local journalist Malcolm Brodie. Support is traditionally split geographically with Linfield based in the south of the city and Glentoran in the east. Although both based in Belfast, they are separated by the River Lagan and are in two different counties. Linfield is based in County Antrim and Glentoran is based in County Down, although Glentoran and other County Down-based sides compete in the County Antrim Shield."]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Malcolm Brodie, 86, sports journalist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2013", "response": ["*Malcolm Brodie, 86, British sports journalist.Funeral of NI sports journalist Malcolm Brodie takes place|BBC.co.uk"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Brodie", "response": ["Malcolm Brodie may refer to:", "* Malcolm Brodie (politician), mayor of Richmond, British Columbia", "* Malcolm Brodie (journalist), Scottish-born journalist from Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "1979 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Malcolm Brodie, Sports Editor, Belfast Telegraph."]}]}}
