He and his father-in-law, Michael Sobell, entered ownership in 1957 and were immediately successful when purchasing London Cry, who won the 1958 Cambridgeshire Handicap. In 1960 they purchased the Ballymacoll Stud in Ireland from the estate of Dorothy Paget. Although they had many winners their first really good racehorse was a colt called Reform, who was the champion miler of 1967 and won amongst other races the St. James's Palace Stakes Sussex Stakes and Champion Stakes. Up until 1971 his horses were trained by Sir Gordon Richards but in 1970 with his father in law he purchased the West Ilsley stables from Jakie Astor, whereupon Dick Hern became his trainer. They had almost immediate success with two good Ballymacoll bred two-year-olds, and subsequent three-year-old milers, in Sallust and Sun Prince. They also owned and bred the St Leger Stakes runner-up Homeric. In 1974 Gaily, a purchased filly, won the Irish One Thousand Guineas. Their next good horse was Admetus who won the Washington International Stakes and the Prince of Wales's Stakes. A few years later they bred and owned Cistus who won the Lupe Stakes, Child Stakes, Nassau Stakes and the Prix de l'Op\u00e9ra. They achieved every owner/breeders dream when Troy won the 200th Epsom Derby in 1979. In 1981 they sold the stables to the Queen."]}, {"page": "Lucy Middleton", "response": ["Middleton held Plymouth Sutton until 1951, when it was gained by another member of the Astor family, Jakie Astor."]}, {"page": "Joe Mercer (jockey)", "response": ["Despite winning his jockey championship with Henry Cecil, it was his relationship with the West Ilsley stable under Dick Hern for which he is most famous. Hern took over as trainer at West Ilsley at the end of 1962 on the retirement of Jack Colling, and there was no question he would remain in place on Hern's takeover. The stable was endowed with several top owner-breeders and was now owned by John Jacob Astor (then known as Jakie Astor, and later as Sir John Astor), who with his brother Lord Astor provided most of the horse firepower.", "1968 promised much and Mercer scored two early victories in Classic Trials when Heathen (owned by Holliday) won the Greenham Stakes and La Mome (owned by Jakie Astor) won the Princess Elizabeth Stakes. Early in May, Remand (owned also by Astor) beat Connaught in the Chester Vase, a recognised Epsom Derby trial, whilst giving the Noel Murless trained colt weight. Soon afterwards the horses appeared to lose form and Dick Hern described Remand's appearance in the paddock at Epsom prior to the Derby as being 'horrible, his coat was standing up like a hedgehog'. Beaten by both Sir Ivor and the Chester Vase second, Connaught, Remand finished fourth. Through the equine virus in the stables, Mercer missed a good chance of winning the Derby, a race he was ultimately never to win. Remand was very ill after the race, not appearing again that season and the stable went into decline. Despite shutting down completely for months on end, the virus did not leave the stable until the end of the 1969 season. However Mercer did manage to win the Doncaster Cup, a leading late-season Group race for his stable with The Accuser.", "Jakie Astor negotiated to sell West Ilsley to Sobell and his son-in-law Arnold Weinstock on the understanding that both Hern and Mercer were kept in place as trainer and stable jockey respectively. Before the 1971 flat season started most interest was on the Lady Beaverbrook-owned pair of Seaepic and Seaswan (both sired by Sea Bird II). Both disappointed in their trial races and later, whilst Brigadier Gerard, without a prep race, won what would in hindsight be regarded as the best Two Thousand Guineas since 1947. A Sobell/Weinstock-owned colt, Homeric, won the Lingfield Derby Trial ridden by Mercer. Homeric was the stable's first Derby runner since 1968 when running at Epsom but was outclassed by Mill Reef, finishing fifth. Later in the year Homeric finished second in the St. Leger under Mercer's ride. Brigadier Gerard finished the year the unbeaten winner of six races (five of them Group One). The new power to appear was in the two-year-old ranks, where three smart colts ran at Royal Ascot, all ridden by Mercer. Sun Prince, as a maiden, won the Coventry Stakes and later followed up by winning the Prix Robert Papin in France then finishing third in the Middle Park Stakes. Fellow maiden Sallust was made favourite for the Windsor Castle Stakes but finished unplaced. However he won his next race before ending his season with a win in the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. The third colt, Rampage, having won his maiden decisively attempted the Norfolk Stakes despite the presence of good horses such as Deep Diver and Philipp of Spain. Unfortunately Rampage died of a heart attack during the race."]}, {"page": "GHQ Liaison Regiment", "response": ["Famous Phantom officers included: actors Major David Niven (who initially commanded A Squadron and who remarked in a letter, \"these were wonderful days which I would not have missed for anything\"), Tam Williams and Willoughby Gray; MPs Sir Jakie Astor, The Hon.
