It was seen as a homecoming for a side with a  number of players from the area, including Ford, Ivor Allchurch and Ray Daniel, and Allchurch contributed a goal to the 3\u20130 victory. Wales met Austria at the Racecourse in November 1955, after playing the side in Vienna the previous year. Austria were taken by surprise in the first match by the rough play of Welsh forwards Ford and Derek Tapscott, a style of play uncommon in Europe. The Austrian side wanted to match Wales physically in the return match, which was called \"The Battle of Wrexham\". They claimed a 2\u20131 victory, with Wales's Roy Paul later describing the team's dressing room after the game: \"Our goalkeeper, Jack Kelsey, had scars on both legs. Derek Tapscott [...] had a six-inch gash on his knee. [...] John Charles leaned over his brother Melvyn with tears in his eyes. Melvyn lay silent, still dazed by a tackle which had sent him crashing to the ground\".

Wales' hopes of qualification were ended when Czechoslovakia recorded consecutive victories over East Germany. In their final group game, Wales defeated East Germany 4\u20131 following a hat-trick from Palmer and an own goal from the opposition goalkeeper.
