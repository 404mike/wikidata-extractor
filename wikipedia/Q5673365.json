After the interval, McRoberts and Barnsley's John McCartney were spoken to by the referee for \"getting keen\", the visitors rallied, then scored from a scramble after the ball hit the crossbar. With 20 minutes remaining, Barnsley scored a fourth, and the visitors were beaten. Although Wharton scored a second near the end, the final score was 7\u20132.\"Barnsley v. Small Heath\". The.

Billy Bennett replaced Wigmore in the forward line. Playing against a strong wind, McRoberts opened the scoring when he was first to the rebound after his shot was fumbled, and Bennett converted a cross from Sid Wharton not long before the interval. Persistent attacking led to further goals, from Harry Wilcox and Walter Main, before the visitors' Herbert Munday scored when the ball rebounded off the crossbar.

On a pitch made slippery by a thunderstorm before kickoff, the visitors had Nat Robinson to thank for keeping Gainsborough Trinity at bay; the home side protested that one shot \"scooped out\" by Robinson had in fact crossed the line. Then McRoberts scored a solo goal, Trinity's goalkeeper allowed Wharton's shot from distance to slip through his hands into the net, and Wharton made the half-time score 3\u20130 after a move between McRoberts and Wigmore left him a tap-in. Freddie Fenton pulled one back with a header after Robinson missed his punch, and Bennett made the final score 4\u20131 after the goalkeeper failed to hold a low shot.\"Gainsbro' Trinity v.

At home to Bolton Wanderers, relegated from the First Division in 1899, the defence was worked hard from the outset, but Small Heath \"began to wake up\", and the attack went to the other end, John Willie Sutcliffe playing \"grandly\", particularly when the visitors temporarily went down to ten men. In heavy rain in the second half, the defences had the upper hand, and the game finished goalless.\"Small Heath v. Bolton Wanderers\". The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent: p.8. 2 October 1899.

He played his first Southern League match some six weeks later, and scored his first goals on 10 December, contributing both Argyle goals in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Northampton Town in the Southern League. Assessing his performance in a friendly match against First Division club West Bromwich Albion, the Daily Express reporter described him as \"essentially a trier, by no means lacking in dash or the finer points of the game.\" In the 1904\u201305 season, Owens was used as backup to centre-forward Jasper McLuckie, and finished the season with four goals from 13 league appearances. With the arrival of Harry Wilcox ahead of the 1905\u201306 season, Owens' chances of first-team football appeared limited, but he had a run in the team when Wilcox was used at centre half, and ended up making 28 appearances from which he scored seven goals."]}]}}
