Spamhaus had the case moved from the state court to the U.S. Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and asked to have the case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The court, presided over by Judge Charles Kocoras, proceeded with the case against Spamhaus without considering the jurisdiction issue, prompting British MP Derek Wyatt to call for the judge to be suspended from office. Not having had its objection to jurisdiction examined, Spamhaus refused to participate in the U.S. case any further and withdrew its counsel. However, Spamhaus was deemed by the court to have \"technically accepted jurisdiction\" by having initially responded at all, and the judge, angry at Spamhaus having walked out of his court, awarded e360 a default judgement totaling US$11,715,000 in damages. Spamhaus subsequently announced that it would ignore the judgement because default judgements issued by U.S. courts without a trial \"have no validity in the U.K. and cannot be enforced under the British legal system\"."]}, {"page": "Bedford Blues", "response": ["*  Derek Wyatt, (England)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sittingbourne and Sheppey || Derek Wyatt || Labour || Derek Wyatt || Labour"]}, {"page": "Sittingbourne and Sheppey (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The constituency has been a bellwether of the national result since its creation in 1997.
