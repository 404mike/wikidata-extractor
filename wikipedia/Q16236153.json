Two days later a third former Newcastle United Academy graduate arrived in striker JJ Hooper, who had scored 20 goals in 29 games the previous season for Havant & Waterlooville. The unbeaten start continued with a 1\u20131 draw with Gillingham, Louis Dodds scoring the equalising goal to secure the point. An injury-time penalty from Sam Foley then rescued a point away at Swindon Town as Vale twice came from behind against an attractive Swindon side; the penalty was awarded in bizarre circumstances as Jordan Williams handled the ball from a corner to try and stop the game after seeing a teammate lying injured on the pitch. Vale then cruised to a comfortable 3\u20130 home victory over Doncaster Rovers despite Foley missing a penalty early in the game. Yet another player arrived in the form of central midfielder Jak McCourt, signed on a one-month loan from Leicester City.
