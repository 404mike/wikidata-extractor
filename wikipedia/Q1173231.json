Previously he had been a member of The Housemartins.\nHemingway was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, to Harry Hemingway, a lorry driver and local comedian on the club circuit, and Flo Hemingway, who was one of Hull's best-known barmaids. In Hull's Henry Cooper School, Hemingway was in the same class as The Housemartins' future drummer, Hugh Whitaker. The two shared an interest in drumming, and one day, when the class were asked who would like to learn drums, they put their hands up first.  Hemingway followed Whitaker into bands, first the Newpolitans with Dave Rotheray on bass, and then the Velvetones. Whilst at university in London, Hemingway was the drummer and a founding member of The Shoppers. It became a well regarded post-punk band (Steve Brain guitar/ lead vocals, Maxine Tarte keyboards/ vocals, Gavin Hearne lead guitar/vocals, Christos Yanni  bass/ vocals).\nHis break came when he got a call from Rotheray telling him Whitaker had left The Housemartins. Rotheray recommended him to Housemartins guitarist Stan Cullimore, who phoned him. He was working as a purchase ledger clerk at the time for the Crystal Motor Group. Hemingway quit his job on 6 March 1987, and soon found himself in the studio, recording the band's second album, The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death.\nAfter the Housemartins disbanded, he and Housemartins founder Paul Heaton put together The Beautiful South from its ashes, featuring roadie and bassist Sean Welch.\nHemingway's first solo album, Hello Cruel World, was released as a download only on iTunes. The album's title was inspired by Hemingway's experience recording in the capital.\nAfter forming \"The South\" in 2008, Hemingway along with Alison Wheeler from the Beautiful South line-up, released their first album since 2006 entitled Sweet Refrains. The album, featuring songs written by keyboardist Damon Butcher and guitarist Phil Barton, was recorded and released in 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 20", "response": ["*  1960   \u2013 Dave Hemingway, English singer-songwriter and drummer "]}, {"page": "Fatboy Slim", "response": ["In 1985, Heaton formed a guitar band called the Housemartins.

They also reached number one just before Christmas 1986 with a version of \"Caravan of Love\", originally a hit the year before for Isley-Jasper-Isley. By 1988 they split up. Heaton and the band's drummer Dave Hemingway went on to form The Beautiful South, while Cook moved back to Brighton to pursue his interest in the style of music he preferred. He started working with young studio engineer Simon Thornton, with whom he continues to make records.

(Heaton was with the Housemartins for their entire existence; Hemingway joined in time for their second and final album.) The band was known for blending overt socialist politics and a form of Christianity, having baited the British monarchy, the building industry and South African apartheid in their songs as well as including gospel elements in their music. The Housemartins often claimed to have set a fixed lifespan for themselves, and the members duly brought the band to an end in 1988 at the height of its success.

The Housemartins released a number of singles and two studio albums, London 0 Hull 4 and The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death.

The initial lineup consisted of Heaton, Dave Rotheray on lead guitar, former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch on bass, David Stead on drums and Housemartins former drummer Dave Hemingway, now in the role of joint lead singer and frontman. The writing partnership of Heaton and Rotheray proved very successful. The Beautiful South released two top ten singles, \"Song for Whoever\" and \"You Keep It All In\"; the latter featured Irish singer Briana Corrigan on vocals.
