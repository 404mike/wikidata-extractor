She first joined Wace's excavations at Mycenae in 1939, aged 8. Following this excavation, the Wace family stayed in Athens, where French attended a British Council school; after the outbreak of World War II, French and her mother left for America in June 1940, before joining her father in Alexandria, Egypt, four years later on his appointment as Professor of Classics and Archaeology at the Farouk I University at Alexandria. In 1946, the family returned to the UK, where French completed her schooling at Cheltenham Ladies' College.", "French was a leading expert in Mycenaean pottery, especially figurines, and a long-standing excavator of the site of Mycenae. In her PhD thesis, she developed a detailed classification scheme for a series of Mycenaean terracotta figurines dating from the Late Helladic period (c. 1500\u20131100 BC). She coined the term kourotrophos for a particular class of these artifacts depicting a woman holding a child. She excavated at Mycenae for many years, from 1950-1957 with her father Alan Wace, and following his death with Lord William Taylour and George Mylonas until 1969, and developed a systematic classification of Mycenaean pottery, enabling its use in establishing the relative date of archaeological finds. French and Taylour were also joint editors, with Kenneth Wardle, of the series of publications arising from the Mycenae excavations, Well-Built Mycenae (1981-). In the 1960s she lived in Ankara with her husband David French, at that time Director of the British Institute at Ankara, joining excavations at Ayios Stephanos (Greece) and Can Hasan (Turkey), and working on material excavated from Greek sites such as Tiryns. French served as the Warden of Ashburne Hall, a residential hall of the University of Manchester, from 1976-1989, during which time she was also an honorary lecturer in the Manchester Department of Archaeology; in 1989, she was appointed as the first woman Director of the British School at Athens, a position which she held until 1994.
