He also played for many amateur teams. He was born in Leicester and died at Merton, Surrey. He was the brother of the England Test cricketer Jack Crawford and of the Leicestershire first-class cricketer Reginald Crawford.\nDuring his lifetime, he was generally referred to as \"Frank Crawford\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1902", "response": ["The England XI which took the field at The Saffrons in Eastbourne was captained by Gilbert Jessop and included two more players with Test experience, Bobby Abel and Bill Storer. Neither had featured in the first two Tests of the series, however. Darling won the toss and chose to bat, though play was delayed until after lunch on the first day, and the Australians made 154, with Hill scoring 46 and Trumper 31. England XI then fell to 29 for five, Abel having made 26 of the runs, while Trumble took three wickets. He added a further five to that on the second day, bowling unchanged throughout the England XI's innings, and the eighth-wicket partnership between Jessop and Vivian Crawford was worth almost two-thirds of England XI's total. Trumble eventually had both men caught, and Gregory made 71 as the Australians set a target of 200, while the hosts George Thompson took eight for 88 in the second innings. Trumble then added six to his haul of wickets, as the England XI were bowled out for 70, with both Jessop and Crawford falling in single digits."]}, {"page": "Vivian (personal name)", "response": ["* Vivian Crawford (1879\u20131922), English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "Crawford (name)", "response": ["*Vivian Crawford (1879\u20131922), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Wellington representative cricketers", "response": ["|  || 1917/18 || 1917/18 || 2 || - || - || -|| - || - || - || Son of John Crawford, brother of Reginald and Vivian Crawford and nephew of Frank Crawford.

He succeeded Sir Arthur Hazlerigg as captain for the 1911 season with an extremely poor side: Vivian Crawford, a mainstay of the batting, had departed for Sri Lanka and fast bowler Thomas Jayes was able to play only two matches because of the tuberculosis that led to his early death; in addition, Ewart Astill, the other reliable bowler of previous years, lost form so badly that he lost his place in the team. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that \"no one but a sanguine man of happy disposition could have gone through the season at all complacently\". In 24 first-class matches, Leicestershire lost 18 times and gained just a single victory, though they did not finish bottom of the County Championship because Somerset's record was even worse. The single victory was one of the sensational matches of the season: Yorkshire, in the match after Wilfred Rhodes' benefit match, were shot out for just 47 by John King's left-arm medium pace and Leicestershire won by an innings."]}, {"page": "Frank Crawford (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Vivian Crawford (1879\u20131922), English cricketer, known as \"Frank\" during his playing career"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Whitgift School", "response": ["*Vivian Crawford, cricketer, England, Surrey CCC and Leicestershire CCC"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1895\u20131914)", "response": ["* Vivian Crawford (1902\u20131908) : V.
