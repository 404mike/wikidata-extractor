Burrows took charge of two games as caretaker-manager following Megson's departure in November 2004, but left the Hawthorns once Bryan Robson arrived, despite being offered a role in the new setup. He was then given an opportunity to resurrect his partnership with Gary Megson, when he was offered the job of first team coach at Nottingham Forest, but he turned the post down, citing family reasons. He did join up with Megson again two years later though, taking up a role in the Leicester City coaching setup. The partnership was not to last long, however, as after just 41 days in the job Megson resigned, leaving Burrows as caretaker manager alongside Gerry Taggart.
