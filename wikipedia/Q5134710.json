He was the son of Reginald Clive Berrang\u00e8 van Ryneveld (b. 7 July 1891, d. 1969) and Maria Alfreda Blanckenberg (b.1900, d.1994).  Before his death in 2018, he was the oldest living South African cricket captain.\nVan Ryneveld was also an international rugby union player. He represented Oxford University RFC in The Varsity Match in 1947, 1948 and 1949 and won four caps as a centre for the England national rugby union team, playing in all four matches of the 1949 Five Nations Championship. He scored three tries for England; one against Ireland and two against Scotland. He never represented South Africa at rugby union.\nAccording to an obituary by Sport24 he \"was one of South Africa\u2019s greatest all-round sportsmen who represented and captained South Africa at cricket and represented England at rugby during his time as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University (where his older brother Anthony was also a Rhodes Scholar), but he will be remembered equally for the role he played in trying to create a just society for all in South Africa\".EW Swanton, the journalist and broadcaster, described him as \u201cjust about the best centre three quarter of my time in English football . . . he had speed, balance, jink and body swerve, lovely hands, a remarkably cool brain; and though comparatively light was indomitable in defence.\u201dVan Ryneveld had a brief career in South African politics. In 1957 he was elected to Parliament as a member of the United Party, then the main opposition to the governing National Party which had introduced apartheid to South Africa.  Two years later, in 1959, Van Ryneveld and eleven other MPs broke from the United Party to form the Progressive Party, which adopted a much more aggressive opposition to apartheid. The party's platform was ahead of its time, and in the 1961 general election all of the Progressive MPs except one, Helen Suzman, lost their seats.  \nThereafter Van Ryneveld practised law. In his last years he lived in Cape Town with his wife, Verity Anne Hunter (b.25 September 1931). Their three children, Mark, Philip and Tessa, live in South Africa. \nHe published 20th Century All-rounder: Reminiscences and Reflections of Clive van Ryneveld in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["The generosity of the white South African hosts towards the MCC team was almost their undoing Cowdrey remembering \"If we were not actually killed by kindness we were certainly reduced to something well short of the fitness that a Test team must maintain ... Our standards dropped alarmingly. It was not fatal at the time for in 1956 South Africa did not have the cricketing resources to expose our indulgence\".Cowdrey, p. 114 It was enough to turn a 2\u20130 lead for the tourists into a 2\u20132 draw against Clive van Ryneveld's energetic team. The all-rounder Trevor Bailey opened the innings with Peterson and Cowdrey returned to batting at number 5, where he made 331 runs (33.10). He made 59 and took three catches in the First Test at the New Wanderers in Johannesburg and made his second Test century \u2013 101 in 369 minutes \u2013 in the Second at Cape Town, which England won by an innings, and batted for 200 minutes making 55 in the second innings of the Fourth back at Johannesburg when Hugh Tayfield took 9/113 in South Africa's 17 run win.

Wardle took five wickets for 53. Injuries to Neil Adcock and Clive van Ryneveld restricted South Africa to defensive bowling and fielding, but Compton (64) and Cowdrey (61) scored fast enough to allow May to declare, setting South Africa 385 to win in eight hours. They had little answer to Wardle, who took seven for 36 to finish with match figures of 12 for 89. In the South African second innings, Russell Endean was out handled the ball when he touched a ball that had flown upwards from his bat and threatened to fall on his stumps.
