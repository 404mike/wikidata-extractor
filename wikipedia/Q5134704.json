He is also a critic, literary journalist, broadcaster and lecturer. \nWilmer was born in Harrogate, Yorkshire and attended Emanuel School and King's College, Cambridge. He is the brother of writer and photographer Val Wilmer. He has a daughter, a son and two grandsons. He shares his life with the historian of science Patricia Fara.\nWilmer's poetry is usually formal but occasionally experimental. He sees religion as fundamental to what he writes, yet he does not associate himself with a parochial view of spiritual matters. His work is also marked by an enthusiasm for architecture and visual culture.\nHe is currently resident in Cambridge, where he is Emeritus Fellow of Sidney Sussex College. He is also an Honorary Fellow of Anglia Ruskin University, an Anniversary Fellow of Whitelands College, University of Roehampton, and an Honorary Patron of the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow.He has had various teaching jobs in Italy \u2013 in Florence, Verona, Padua and Venice. In 2015 he was a Visiting Professor at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.\nHe is interested in the art of verse translation and has translated himself from several languages, In particular, he has translated in collaboration with the Hungarian poet George G\u00f6m\u00f6ri. Together they have translated selections from Mikl\u00f3s Radn\u00f3ti, Gy\u00f6rgy Petri, J\u00e1nos Pilinszky and G\u00f6m\u00f6ri himself, as well as individual pieces by several others. Wilmer\u2019s own poems have been translated into Hungarian, Italian and Spanish.\nWilmer was the prime mover of the Ezra Pound centenary exhibition Pound's Artists: Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts in London, Paris and Italy, held at Kettle's Yard and the Tate Gallery in 1985. From 1986 to 1990 he was one of the four founding editors of the magazine Numbers.He is an enthusiastic advocate for the work of the Victorian critic, artist, philanthropist and social reformer John Ruskin. Since 2004, he has been a Director of the Guild of St George, the charity founded by Ruskin. He became Master of the Guild in 2009. He has also written extensively on William Morris.\nAmong contemporary writers, Wilmer has written on the work of the poets Thom Gunn and Donald Davie and has edited volumes of their essays. His annotated edition of Gunn's Selected Poems was published by Faber and Faber in 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Clive Wilmer (born 1945, E)"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Clive Wilmer (born 1945), English poet"]}, {"page": "John Ruskin", "response": ["Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day Anglia Ruskin University has grown.For the address itself, see Cook and Wedderburn 16.177\u2013206, and for the wider context: Clive Wilmer, \"Ruskin and Cambridge\" in The Companion (Newsletter of The Guild of St. George) no.7 (2007), pp.8\u201310. [Revised version of inaugural Ruskin Lecture, Anglia Ruskin University, 11 October 2006)] In The Two Paths (1859), five lectures given in London, Manchester, Bradford and Tunbridge Wells, Ruskin argued that a 'vital law' underpins art and architecture, drawing on the labour theory of value. (For other addresses and letters, Cook and Wedderburn, vol. 16, pp.\u00a0427\u201387.) The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, during which they visited Germany and Switzerland.", "In the July 1877 letter of Fors Clavigera, Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by James McNeill Whistler exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery. He found particular fault with Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket, and accused Whistler of asking two hundred guineas for \"flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\".Linda Merrill, A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin. \u2013 book review, Art in America, January 1993, by Wendy Steiner  Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin, but Ruskin was ill when the case went to trial in November 1887, so the artist Edward Burne-Jones and Attorney General Sir John Holker represented him. The trial took place on 25 and 26 November, and many major figures of the art world at the time appeared at the trial. Artist Albert Moore appeared as a witness for Whistler, and artist William Powell Frith appeared for Ruskin. Frith said \"the nocturne in black in gold is not in my opinion worth two hundred guineas\". Frederic Leighton also agreed to give evidence for Whistler, but in the end could not attend as he had to go to Windsor to be knighted. Edward Burne-Jones, representing Ruskin, also asserted that Nocturne in Black and Gold was not a serious work of art. When asked to give reasons, Burne-Jones said he had never seen one painting of night that was successful, but also acknowledged that he saw marks of great labour and artistic skill in the painting. In the end, Whistler won the case, but the jury awarded damages of only a derisory farthing (the smallest coin of the realm) to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription organised by the Fine Art Society, but Whistler was bankrupt within six months, and was forced to sell his studio. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, and may have accelerated his mental decline.For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, \"Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity\" in Nineteenth-Century Prose, vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13\u201334. It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in Sesame and Lilies printed in \"blood-red\".", "Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, literary criticism, the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume \"Library Edition\", completed in 1912 by his friends Edward Tyas Cook and Alexander Wedderburn. The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, cause certain difficulties. In 1898, John A. Hobson observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, \"the spell of his eloquence is broken\".J. A. Hobson, John Ruskin: Social Reformer (J. Nisbet & Co., 1898), p. viii. Clive Wilmer has written, further, that, \"The anthologising of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts [... is] something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start.\"Clive Wilmer (ed.), Unto This Last and Other Writings (Penguin, 1985), pp. 36\u201337.

It was welcomed as a partial return to \"the appreciation of a certain gnarled, natural beauty\"Nicholas Lezard, in The Guardian, 21 January 2006  and it was seen that it \"escapes the shortcomings of Hill's recent work\".Clive Wilmer in New Statesman, 27 February 2006  Poet Alan Brownjohn identified the following themes: \"'mourning', 'unfruition', 'misconception'\"Alan Brownjohn, in The Sunday Times, 19 February 2006 ", "The central section \u2014 twenty one 25-line \"Pindarics after Cesare Pavese\" \u2014 drew particular attention; Brownjohn seeing it as \"Hill at his most complex and unapproachable\", but Michael Schmidt classing it as \"among Hill's most sustained meditations\".

He confessed to celebrating every year the birthdays of three heroes: Pasteur, Mozart and Paul Val\u00e9ry, all of whom suggest admiration for the life of the mind lived at its highest pitch\u00a0\u2014 a concern for science and its social uses, and a love of art that is elegant, cerebral and orderly.\" That is one part of Bowers. Another aspect is highlighted by Thom Gunn on the back of Bowers's Collected Poems: \"Bowers started with youthful stoicism, but the feeling is now governed by an increasing acceptance of the physical world.\" That 'physical world' encompasses sex and love which are refracted through his restrained and lapidary lines. The effect of this contrast is striking: at once balanced and engaged; detached but acutely aware of sensual satisfactions. Bowers' style owes much to the artistic ethos of Yvor Winters, under whom Bowers studied at Stanford, but his achievement far surpasses that of his mentor, and his other students, such as J. V. Cunningham. He often wrote in rhyme, but also produced some of the finest blank verse in the English language. He wrote very little (his Collected Poems weighs in at 168 pages), due no doubt to the careful consideration behind every single line. But that care never forecloses on the wilder aspects of human existence\u2014the needs, joys and violence.", "* Clive Wilmer's Guardian obituary"]}, {"page": "Chancellor's Gold Medal", "response": ["*1967 Clive Wilmer, King's"]}, {"page": "Val Wilmer", "response": ["Val Wilmer was born in Harrogate, Yorkshire, England, on 7 December 1941.
