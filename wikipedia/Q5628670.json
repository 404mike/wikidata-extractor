Despite conceding a goal within three minutes of his debut (a 2\u20132 draw with Millwall Athletic) Williamson soon settled into the role and helped the club through their first league season.In the summer of 1895, Williamson left the Southampton area and moved to London to find work. In 1896, he joined the Royal Ordnance Factories team at Maze Hill, Greenwich, also playing in the Southern League. Williamson was an ever-present for the Ordnance Factories team, conceding 46 goals in seven matches, including ten in a match against his former side at the Antelope Ground in October 1896. As a result of financial difficulties, the club folded mid-season and their record was expunged.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Ordnance Factories F.C.", "response": ["The club was beset with financial difficulties throughout its life, as well as other problems such as the death of Peter Connolly in 1895. They resigned from the Southern League in the 1896\u201397 season after only playing seven games. All of those games were lost with a total of 46 goals conceded. In October 1896, Royal Ordnance Factories played Southampton St. Mary's at their Antelope Ground, with the match ending 10\u20130. In goal for the Royal Ordnance factory was Herbert Williamson who had been the \"Saints\" goalkeeper in 1894\u201395. Their record was expunged, and it is assumed the club folded soon after, in late 1896."]}, {"page": "Williamson (surname)", "response": ["* Herbert Williamson (1871\u20131946), English football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Southampton St. Mary's F.C. season", "response": ["| Herbert Williamson"]}, {"page": "Jack Barrett (footballer)", "response": ["In October 1894, St. Mary's made their debut in the inaugural Southern League season, with Barrett in goal in the 3\u20131 victory over Chatham. Barrett had a poor league debut, missing a cross early in the match, which was cleared by David \"Taffy\" Hamer. Soon afterwards, Barret was again at fault, allowing Gamble to score the opening goal with \"a soft shot\". Barrett soon rallied, however, and made amends with a \"brilliant save\" from McAucklan before Harry Offer's equalizing goal. Barrett retained his place in goal for the next three games including the 14\u20130 FA Cup victory over Newbury in the first qualifying round on 13 October 1894 \u2013 this is still Southampton's biggest victory in a competitive match.
