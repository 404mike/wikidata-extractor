These were typically built in the corporate International Style, closely associated with the work of modernist pioneer Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, following the simple glass cuboid format of Rohe's famous Seagram Building (1958). Examples of such buildings can be seen in the form of New Zealand House (1960), Millbank Tower (1963), St Helen's (1970) and Euston Tower (1970). Two of the most notable high-rise office buildings built in the period were both designed by the architect George Marsh: Centre Point (1966) and One Kemble Street (1968). Both buildings have a distinctive facade made up of a mosaic of interlocking concrete blocks and large windows, creating an interesting blend of the International Style and Brutalism.
