His son, Jock Wallace Jr., managed Rangers, Leicester City and Sevilla.\nHe began his career at Raith Rovers, before moving south of the border in March 1934 to join compatriot Sandy MacFarlane's Blackpool. He remained at the seaside for fourteen years, notching-up 243 league appearances for the Tangerines. Wallace made his debut at Lincoln City on 17 February 1934 and became almost an ever-present.\nOn more than one occasion, the Scot fell out with the Blackpool board or management, and on one occasion he refused to join the team to play Leeds United in the FA Cup. He was replaced by his understudy, Joe Robinson. Wallace's argument was over contractual terms, and he eventually joined Derby County for a nominal \u00a3500 fee in February 1948.The Rams had a goalkeeping crisis, and Wallace, who wasn't cup-tied, played in the FA Cup sixth round and semi-finals. Derby were knocked out, and it was Blackpool who went on to Wembley from the other semi-final.\nHis job done, Wallace left Derby for Leith Athletic in August 1948, returning to Edinburgh where he had guested for Leith's rivals St Bernard's during the Second World War.\nWallace died in 1978 at the age of 67, 18 years before his son.", "link_mentions": {}}}
