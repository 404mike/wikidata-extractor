The first abbess of Chatteris was Eadnoth's sister, Aelfwyn. Throughout its existence, the abbey was comparatively poor compared to other foundations, due to a lack of royal patronage and a consequent lack of tithe estates. As a result, the abbey survived the first wave of closures during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was surrendered to the king's commissioners in 1538, by which time there were eleven nuns in residence.Claire Breay (ed.), The Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey , (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999). . p.96", "At this date fourteen local families still used the abbey church as parochial but this, unusually, did not save it from demolition, the parishioners being transferred to nearby St Peter and St Paul's Church in the area. It has been conjectured that due to the short space between them, the parish church may have been the abbey church,The Historic Towns of Cambridgeshire, An Extensive Urban Survey: Chatteris , Cambridgeshire County Council publication (draft, 2001), 19 although Claire Breay's Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey discounts this idea, citing that historical documentation clearly defines two separate churches. A range of the cloister buildings survived as part of a mansion known as Park House. This was demolished in 1847 and the site has now completely vanished beneath streets and housing, although the \"Park Streets\" of Chatteris mark the boundary of its walls and several buildings contain stone originating from the abbey.Claire Breay (ed.), The Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey , (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999). , p.92 A large portion of the town was destroyed by a great fire in 1310, which destroyed the nunnery and a large portion of the church, leaving only sections of the base of the tower."]}, {"page": "Newnham College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Claire Breay"]}, {"page": "Chatteris Abbey", "response": ["* Claire Breay (ed.), The Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey, (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999). xiii + 479 pp.; 8 illustrations.
