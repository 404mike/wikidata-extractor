In the match itself, Swindon were \"superior in all departments except the telling ones \u2013 finishing and goalkeeping\" according to David Powell of The Times.  The game remained goal-less until the 81st minute when Smith scored following a free kick from Quow to give Gillingham a single-goal lead going into the second leg.   Three days later at Swindon's County Ground, Elsey volleyed the ball into the goal to give Gillingham a two-goal lead on aggregate, but goals from Peter Coyne and Charlie Henry for Swindon made the result on the day 2\u20131 to Swindon and the aggregate score across the two legs 2\u20132. Unlike in the semi-final, away goals were not used as a tiebreaker in the final; instead the rules stated that, in the event of the scores finishing level after the two legs, a replay would take place at a neutral stadium.  Robert Armstrong of The Guardian described the second leg as \"an epic battle, in the best Anglo-Saxon tradition of the knockout competition\".  The replay took place at Selhurst Park, home of Crystal Palace. It was Gillingham's 63rd match of the season, a new record for the highest number of games the team had played in a season since joining the Football League. Swindon took the lead after only two minutes following a defensive error by Gillingham. Although Gillingham were the stronger team in the second half, they could not manage to score a goal, and Steve White of Swindon got his second goal of the match in the second half.
