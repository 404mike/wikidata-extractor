Muscular and masculine in appearance, dressed only in black, and highly educated, she was later known, generally unkindly, as 'Gentleman Jack'. Her final significant relationship was with Ann Walker, to whom she was notionally married in Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York, now celebrated as the birthplace of lesbian marriage in Britain.\nLister's diaries reveal much about contemporary life in West Yorkshire, including her development of historic Shibden Hall, and her interests in landscaping, mining, railways and canals. Many entries were written in code that was not decrypted until long after her death. These graphic portrayals of lesbianism were so frank that they were thought to be a hoax until their authenticity was confirmed.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 3", "response": ["*1791 \u2013 Anne Lister, English diarist, mountaineer, and traveller (d.1840)"]}, {"page": "Lesbian", "response": ["Perhaps the most famous of these romantic friendships was between Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, nicknamed the Ladies of Llangollen.

Their house became a haven for visitors travelling between Dublin and London, including writers such as Anna Seward, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott, but also the military leader the Duke of Wellington and the industrialist Josiah Wedgwood; aristocratic novelist Caroline Lamb, who was born a Ponsonby, came to visit too. Anne Lister from Yorkshire visited the couple, and was possibly inspired by their relationship to informally marry her own lover. Even travellers from continental Europe had heard of the couple and came to visit them, for instance Prince Hermann von P\u00fcckler-Muskau, the German nobleman and landscape designer, wrote admiringly about them.", "In sharp contrast to the writings of their contemporary Anne Lister, there is nothing in their extensive correspondence or diaries that indicates a sexual relationship. Some consider Butler's and Ponsonby's relationship to be a Boston marriage, or a romantic relationship between two women who chose to live together and have \"marriage-like relationships\". Others conclude that the two had a non-sexual romantic friendship. Norena Shopland says that modern attitudes designed to distinguish same-sex relationships from a romantic friendship indicate they had a sexual relationship. According to Fiona Brideoake, the description of queer is more appropriate than the anachronistic and specific label of lesbian, particularly as queerness is a broad concept and significantly defined by its difference from typicality. Brideoake writes that their relationship was celebrated by other people as a form of mourning the relationships that they could not form."]}, {"page": "Shibden", "response": ["Under the manor park passes an early 19th century-built regular line rail tunnel.

The publication of Anne Lister\u2019s diaries revealed that as early as 1820, educated women had covert sexual and romantic relationships with other women, often while married to men and presenting as close female friendships. Intensely emotional friendships between women were normal in England, making it difficult for scholars to definitively identify same-sex relationships. However, modern scholars suspect that lesbian subscripts exist within much of the literature published by women, as female character yearn romantically after other female characters, but that passion is silenced.
