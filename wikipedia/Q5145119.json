He consistently professed his beliefs as a psychic and garnered a following across his career, whilst critics said his capabilities came from cold reading.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derek Acorah", "response": ["Yvette Fielding, a presenter and executive producer of Most Haunted, initially stated \"there is no acting on this programme, none whatsoever. Everything you see and you hear is real.\" However, significant media attention was directed at the show in 2005, after Acorah claimed to channel spirits with names that had allegedly been suggested to him in advance, such as \"Rik Eedles\" and \"Kreed Kafer\", which are anagrams of \"Derek Lies\" and \"Derek Faker\" respectively. Speaking in 2006, Fielding said of Acorah: \"We tell people everything is real, then it turns out he was a fake, so he had to go.\" His time on the show saw him regularly being parodied, most notably with Shirley Ghostman (portrayed by Marc Wootton), which drew on elements of Acorah and Colin Fry, and Wooton once invaded one of Acorah's shows. He was also parodied by Dawn French on an episode of French and Saunders and by Jon Culshaw on Dead Ringers."]}, {"page": "Mediumship", "response": ["Colin Fry was exposed in 1992 when during a s\u00e9ance the lights were unexpectedly turned on and he was seen holding a spirit trumpet in the air, which the audience had been led to believe was being levitated by spiritual energy.Colin Fry an Evaluation In 1997, Massimo Polidoro and Luigi Garlaschelli produced wax-moulds directly from one's hand which were exactly the same copies as Gustav Geley obtained from Franek Kluski, which are kept at the Institute Metapsychique International.Massimo Polidoro.
