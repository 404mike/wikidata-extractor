He graduated through the Wolverhampton Wanderers youth system to win a contract with Cheltenham Town in May 2004. He spent the next five years at the club, playing in the 2006 League Two play-off final victory. He was loaned out to Aldershot Town in November 2005 and to Colchester United in March 2009, before he joined Colchester permanently in May 2009. He spent three years with the club, before he moved on to Port Vale in July 2012. He helped the \"Valiants\" to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313, before he re-joined Cheltenham Town in July 2013. He signed with Shrewsbury Town in May 2014, and played a minor role as the club won promotion out of League Two in 2014\u201315. He later played non-league football for Worcester City, Stourbridge and Sutton Coldfield Town.\nHe was appointed Worcester City manager in May 2019 and stayed in the post until resigning in December 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 26", "response": ["*  1985   \u2013 Ashley Vincent, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1985", "response": ["* May 26 \u2013 Ashley Vincent, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["With the club still unable to sign new players due to administration in May 2012, Adams offered contracts to 16 of his players for the 2012\u201313 campaign. However, he lost four of his best players in Lee Collins, Anthony Griffith, Sean Rigg, and captain and top-scorer Marc Richards; all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere, leaving Adams needing to rebuild the team largely from scratch. He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons. Vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion, finishing as the division's top-scorers as wingers Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent provided quality service to prolific striker Tom Pope throughout the campaign.", "In preparation for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed to replace the departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place \u2013 far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month."]}, {"page": "Louis Dodds", "response": ["Desperate to play as a striker in the 2012\u201313 season, he got his wish as he was played as a deep-lying striker in partnership with Tom Pope.

On 18 September, he converted a \"stunning strike with the outside of his foot\" in a 5\u20132 victory over Fleetwood Town at Highbury Stadium \u2013 later this was voted the club's goal of the season.

He was quoted as saying that this was the best game of his career, as he proved a point to his detractors at former club Rotherham. A brace in a 2\u20130 win over Exeter City at St James Park on 6 October took him to 11 goals in 13 games; this meant that, with the season only a quarter of the way in, the 27-year-old had reached his best ever goal tally. It also made him the fastest Vale player to reach double figures since Tom Nolan hit ten goals within the first eleven games of the 1933\u201334 season. Pope was quick to credit wing duo Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent for supplying him with the chances he needed to find the net so frequently. His seven goals in seven games saw him named as League Two Player of the Month for September 2012. Fans at Vale Park began to chant \"Feed the Pope and he will score\" throughout matches, and he picked up the nickname of the \"Sneyd Green Sniper / Assassin\", in reference to his hometown. A hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win over Bristol Rovers on 20 November meant that he became the quickest player to reach 20 goals (from the start of the season) in the club's Football League history. In February, he signed a new contract to keep him at the club until summer 2015. The next month he was named as League Two's Player of the Year after leading the division's scoring charts by five goals despite hitting an 11-game goal drought. After winning the award he claimed his third hat-trick of the season on 29 March, as Vale beat promotion rivals Cheltenham Town 3\u20132. Vale secured promotion with a third-place finish at the end of the season, and Pope finished on 33 goals in 51 games.
