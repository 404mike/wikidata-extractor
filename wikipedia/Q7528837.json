On 8 July 1823 he married his first cousin Mary Anne Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. Dr. Robert Price, Canon of Salisbury and Prebendary of Durham, by his second wife Mary Anne Sanderson. The marriage took place at the house of Barrington Price, then of Haslemere, the youngest of his six uncles on his father's side. Sir Uvedale Price died in 1829 and Robert succeeded as 2nd Baronet of Foxley.\nSir Robert stood for election to the constituency of Hereford City in 1845; he was unopposed, and remained the city's MP until January 1857. He was \"of Whig principles; in favour of an extension of the franchise and short parliaments\".In 1820, he began buying up leases, leading to the founding of Tondu Ironworks. His Glamorgan Coal and Iron Company prospered during the 1830s and 1840s, but by 1850 it was struggling because of a fall in iron prices and Sir Robert was in danger of bankruptcy until the works were bought in 1854 by John Brogden and Sons.He died 5 or 6 November 1857 without issue, whereupon the baronetcy became extinct. His widow died in March 1878.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
