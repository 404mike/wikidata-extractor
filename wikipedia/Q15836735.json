Beauman named the company Persephone after the Greek goddess connected with spring who is \"both 'victim and mistress'\". Beauman wanted to upend the devaluing of women writers in literary culture and to restore previously lost works to the canon. She was inspired by Virago Press, which had published her first book A Very Great Profession: The Woman's Novel 1914-39, and its commitment to reprinting lost classics of women's literature."]}, {"page": "Francesca Beauman", "response": ["Beauman is married to the film director James Bobin, with whom she has three children.
