His most significant contribution was in the study of post-Conquest pottery; he was largely responsible for establishing the first chronological framework by which different types of English ceramics could be dated. His work has been described as 'visionary' and 'seminal'. It has been noted that Dunning didn't achieve the profile of some of his peers due to the fact that he didn't write a text-book on either medieval pottery in particular or on medieval archaeology in general, but concentrated on writing articles for academic journals and encouraged the research interests of others, however John Hurst argued that, '...we should regard Gerald Dunning as the main founding father of medieval archaeology as we know it today in the last quarter of the 20th Century'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Finglesham Anglo-Saxon cemetery", "response": ["The artefacts uncovered by the excavation were then divided between themselves and the local landowner, Lord Northbourne, the latter of whom kept the finer jewellery. Stebbing and Whiting wanted a wider audience for the finds, and put them on display at an exhibit at the Mason Dieu at Ospringe near Faversham. In June 1963, Gerald Dunning, then Inspector of Ancient Monuments for the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, had the artefacts moved to a more local display in the gatehouse of Deal Castle. In the late 1980s they were moved again, this time to Deal Public Library, the exhibit was decommissioned in 1992, with the objects placed into storage at Dover Museum."]}, {"page": "The Conway Photographic Library", "response": ["# Gerald Dunning"]}]}}
