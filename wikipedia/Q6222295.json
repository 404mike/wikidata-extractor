The central stone hall was designed, as was the interior of the entire house, by William Kent, who had the help of the sculptor John Michael Rysbrack and the stuccoist Johann Baptist Atari. Antique dealer John Bly calls Kent the first true interior decorator. Kent was inspired by his meeting with Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, who became Kent's patron. Together they created decor such as the chairs in the saloon, covered in red Utrecht velvet, and those in the hall, covered in even rarer green velvet. The bronze laoco\u00f6n in the hall is a copy by the French sculptor Fran\u00e7ois Girardon. Kent's mahogany staircase is part of one of the first large-scale uses of that wood in a house."]}, {"page": "Kimbolton Cabinet", "response": ["The cabinet was exhibited the 1857 Art Treasures exhibition in Manchester.
