Albert Meltzer argued that anarcho-capitalism simply cannot be anarchism because capitalism and the state are inextricably interlinked and because capitalism exhibits domineering hierarchical structures such as that between an employer and an employee. Anna Morgenstern approaches this topic from the opposite perspective, arguing that anarcho-capitalists are not really capitalists because \"mass concentration of capital is impossible\" without the state. According to Jeremy Jennings, \"[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas\", referring to anarcho-capitalism, argued to have \"roots deep in classical liberalism\" more so than in anarchism, \"are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is\". For Jennings, \"anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the 'anarcho-capitalists' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community\". Similarly, Barbara Goodwin, Emeritus Professor of Politics at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, argues that anarcho-capitalism's \"true place is in the group of right-wing libertarians\", not in anarchism. Nonetheless, some right-libertarian scholars like Michael Huemer, who identify with the ideology, describe anarcho-capitalism as a \"variety of anarchism\". British author Andrew Heywood also believes that \"individualist anarchism overlaps with libertarianism and is usually linked to a strong belief in the market as a self-regulating mechanism, most obviously manifest in the form of anarcho-capitalism\"."]}, {"page": "Heywood, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Heywood"]}]}}
