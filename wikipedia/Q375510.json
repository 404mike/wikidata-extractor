He currently works as a coach for Manchester City.\nBorn in Ipswich, he joined Ipswich Town as a trainee, going on to play for the club 298 times between 1995 and 2001. He then moved to Premier League club Arsenal, before being signed by Everton in 2002, where he spent five years. A brief spell on loan from West Ham United with Southampton was followed by a transfer back to Ipswich Town. After a short spell at Sheffield United, a third stint at Ipswich and a brief time at Preston North End, he joined Premier League champions Manchester City on a free transfer in 2012. After four years at City, during which he did not play at all, he announced his retirement in May 2016.

A highlight of this season was when Seaman dramatically saved a Gareth Barry penalty as Arsenal won 2\u20131 at Aston Villa."]}, {"page": "David Moyes", "response": ["Moyes prepared for his first full season in charge at Everton by signing Chinese international Li Tie, Nigerian defender Joseph Yobo and goalkeeper Richard Wright and released older players such as Jesper Blomqvist and David Ginola. On 12 April 2003, Moyes was sent to the stands during a game against West Bromwich Albion by referee Steve Bennett for using foul and abusive language and for improper behaviour. Everton were edged out of qualification for the following season's UEFA Cup on the last day of the season by Blackburn Rovers, following a defeat by Manchester United, and finished seventh in the league. Moyes was awarded LMA Manager of the Year for the first time, to go with the Premier League Manager of the Month award for November 2002, when the Toffees had been in the Champions League places."]}, {"page": "Ipswich Town F.C.", "response": ["Ipswich currently runs a Category Two Academy, with a five-year plan to improve to Category One. The academy is run by Lee O'Neill and Bryan Klug. The academy was particularly successful in the 1990s, producing a number of first-team players including Kieron Dyer, Richard Wright and Titus Bramble.

Mindful of the Bosman ruling and what happened with Steve McManaman (Britain's first high-profile Bosman related transfer), Tottenham offered him a contract which would have made him the club's highest-ever paid player, but after months of negotiations and several public assurances he would stay at Spurs, Campbell stated his need to leave the club in order to play UEFA Champions League football, with the likes of England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson advising him of such a course. Several top continental clubs expressed interest in signing him, but he joined Arsenal\u00a0\u2013 Tottenham's biggest rivals\u00a0\u2013 on a free transfer. Campbell had previously stated in an interview with Spurs Monthly magazine that he would never play for Arsenal. The move was also unusual as no rumours of a move to Arsenal had been leaked or speculated upon in the media before the press conference revealing his decision, and many journalists in attendance had been led to believe they were there to witness the unveiling of goalkeeper Richard Wright, which would have been a routine sports news story."]}, {"page": "Sander Westerveld", "response": ["In July 2005 he moved back to the Premier League with Portsmouth, being signed by Alain Perrin on a one-year contract. He was expected to be the first choice goalkeeper, ahead of Jamie Ashdown and Kostas Chalkias. However, after an inconsistent time at Fratton Park, in which he played only 6 league matches, he was allowed to move on a 28-day loan to Everton, rivals of his former club Liverpool, on 24 February 2006. Everton had a temporary goalkeeping crisis in which Nigel Martyn, Richard Wright and Iain Turner were all unavailable, and Westerveld played two matches for them. When he returned to Portsmouth, he remained a substitute and was released by Harry Redknapp on 11 May 2006."]}, {"page": "Brian McBride", "response": ["Two years later, Premier League club Everton were beginning to slide down the table.

During McBride's three months with the club, he did not disappoint Moyes, scoring four goals in eight games, including his first game with the club, a 4\u20133 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He made close friends during the short time with players such as Leon Osman (with whom he still plays soccer) and Richard Wright."]}, {"page": "Malta national football team", "response": ["In October 1994 Malta held Czech Republic 0\u20130 in a qualifier for the UEFA Euro 1996, in which the latter ended runners-up. Six years later, in October 2000, in a group qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup, once again Malta managed another 0\u20130 draw vs Czech Republic which eventually cost the latter a place at the following major tournament. In June 2000, Malta played England, then managed by Kevin Keegan. Trailing 2\u20131 going into the final minutes, Malta were awarded a penalty, however David Carabott's effort was saved by Richard Wright. Through November 2001 and May 2002, Malta played and remained undefeated in 6 international matches and in between they won the locally hosted (Rothmans) International Tournament. During 2005, Malta drew 1\u20131 against Croatia and Bulgaria. Another positive result was the 1\u20131 home draw in a friendly match against Northern Ireland, though George Mallia missed an injury time penalty which would have given them a win. On 11 October 2006, Malta managed another competitive victory, a 2\u20131 triumph over Hungary in the European Championship qualifying with Andr\u00e9 Schembri scoring twice."]}, {"page": "Stuart Taylor (footballer, born 1980)", "response": ["Taylor was born in Romford, London. After a brief spell as a teenager with Wimbledon, Taylor joined Arsenal in 1997 as a youth player. He made his Arsenal debut in a League Cup game against Ipswich Town in November 2000. While at Arsenal he was loaned out to Bristol Rovers, Crystal Palace, Peterborough United  and Leicester City. His league debut for Arsenal came in a 3\u20131 win against Manchester United in November 2001. He went on to make ten League appearances in Arsenal's 2001\u201302 Premier League-winning season, thus qualifying him for a winners' medal. This feat was achieved in the final match against Everton, with the title already won. Richard Wright started the game with Taylor upon nine appearances. Manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger substituted Wright in the 85th minute of play for Taylor who thus earned a medal with this cap."]}, {"page": "Nigel Martyn", "response": ["In the middle of 2003, Leeds were approached by Chelsea and Everton with offers to sign Martyn. Both clubs were offering the out-of-favour goalkeeper a backup post: at Chelsea, he would understudy Carlo Cudicini; at Everton, the first-choice was Richard Wright. Martyn chose to move to Everton, and six games into the season, an injury to Wright gave him his Everton debut. His performances for the first team during Wright's recovery were such that Martyn remained Everton's first-choice goalkeeper even after Wright returned from injury."]}, {"page": "David Carabott", "response": ["Carabott made his first appearance for the Maltese senior team on 15 November 1987, a 1\u20131 draw against Switzerland. A year later, on 23 November 1988, he scored his first international goal, the opener in a 1\u20131 draw against Cyprus. In total he played 122 times for the national team and with 12 goals, Carabott was at one point one of the highest scorers. One of these was a goal in a friendly against England, played on 3 June 2000, which temporarily equalised the game, although England went on to score the winner later on. Carabott also had a chance to score a second equaliser late on when Malta were awarded another penalty, but this effort was saved by Richard Wright."]}]}}
