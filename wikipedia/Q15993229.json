Gaining experience in the design of council housing, he became well known for designing the large Park Hill complex in Sheffield, with Ivor Smith.\nWhen J. Lewis Womersley, the Sheffield City Architect, moved to Manchester in 1964 to join in private practice with Sir Hugh Wilson, Lynn moved to Manchester where he was principal architect in the office. He oversaw preparation of plans for the Higher Education Precinct, for the Arndale shopping centre and for the development of Hulme, where Park Hill's principles of design proved less readily transferable to a flat site. In the late 1960s Lynn returned to the North East of England, working on the development of Newcastle University's   campus and forming Kendrick and Lynn Associates, designing various Roman Catholic churches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Park Hill, Sheffield", "response": ["Following the war it was decided that a radical scheme needed to be introduced to deal with rehousing the Park Hill community. To that end, architects Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith under the supervision of J. L. Womersley, Sheffield Council's City Architect, began work in 1953 designing the Park Hill Flats.  Inspired by Le Corbusier's Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation and the Smithsons' unbuilt schemes, most notably for Golden Lane in London, the deck access scheme was viewed as revolutionary at the time.

We are unlikely ever again to see architecture, let alone housing, delivered in such a confident and optimistic way.\"Satwinder Samra. Quoted in Ramchurn, R. (2013). Jack Lynn Dies at 86. In  Architects\u2019 Journal, 24 October 2013.", "Womersley was an advocate of high rise living and it was seen as a solution to slum clearance, being raised at two major RIBA symposia in 1955 and 1957, where he suggested that 50% of the population wished to inhabit high-rise accommodation.Parkinson-Bailey, J. J. (2000). Manchester: An Architectural History. He determined that this would be the solution to the difficulties presented by the Sheffield specification and in order to do so, he established an imaginative and highly enthusiastic team, including Ivor Smith and Jack Lynn, committed to creating the good quality accommodation for people to live in. The city\u2019s topology, three main land masses containing steep escarpment, rolling plateau and a series of ridges, presented a challenge but allowed many of them to be visually related; \"with the hilltop architectural compositions producing something of the fascination of the Italian hill towns\" that had inspired Womersley in the 1930s.Quoted in his obituary in The Architectural Review, November 1990 The city centre, which, up until then had been neglected, with all council resources directed towards housing, was to be redeveloped under Womersley\u2019s department, including the Hole in the Road and the Castle Market, designed by Andrew Derbyshire with J. Stuart Mackie. The Castle Market was intended to form the cornerstone of a pedestrianised city centre which was as pioneering as Park Hill. Unfortunately it never progressed and the market was demolished in 2015.", "Following transformation of the two of Sheffield\u2019s central hills, Netherthorpe and Woodside, attention was turned to the third, Park Hill, which was to become the largest listed building in Europe. Commenting in Melvyn Bragg\u2019s Reel History of Britain,Charlie Luxton interviewed by Melvyn Bragg, Reel History of Britain: Series 1 episode 17. BBC, 2011. Charlie Luxton describes it as, \"one of Britain\u2019s best examples of what modern council housing can be about. The idea was to create a sense of community with these streets in the sky\u2026 They invested in the infrastructure, they invested in the shops, the schools, the playgrounds\". Park Hill\u2019s principal architects, Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith, were appointed almost straight from college without formal interviews.Derbyshire, Andrew. Quoted in Gold, John R. (2007). The Practice of Modernism 1954\u20131972. London: Routledge.  Inspired by Le Corbusier\u2019s Unite d\u2019Habitation in Marseille they created these \u2018streets in the sky\u2019 on the steeply sloping land near the city centre. Every effort was made to establish a community feel \u2013 the decks, or \u2018streets\u2019, facilitating doorstep gossip and encouraging children to play \u2018outside\u2019. The streets, it is affectionately recalled, were wide enough for milk floats and tricycles and importantly separated man and child from traffic. Like the sheltered balconies of each flat, the decks provided magnificent views. They were given the street names of the original slums, Norwich, Long Henry and Hague, with previous neighbours housed close to one another as far as possible. Contained in the grounds were shops, schools, children\u2019s play areas, pubs, concierges and a police station. Womersley reflected on his team\u2019s architectural developments across Sheffield that:", "By 1964, the input of City Architect into the development of the city, along with the route for the M1, was in the hands of the City Engineer and Womersley left Sheffield to join Hugh Wilson as partner in private practice in Manchester, taking with him six of his Sheffield staff, including Jack Lynn and J. Stuart Mackie."]}, {"page": "Newcastle University School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape", "response": ["*Jack Lynn"]}]}}
