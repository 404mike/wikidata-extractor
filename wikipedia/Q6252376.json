He worked in copper and his style is described as arts and crafts / Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style).Together with Charles Robert Ashbee, he was a founding member of the Guild of Handicraft at Whitechapel, London in 1888. John Pearson was dismissed from the Guild of Handicraft in 1892 and made his way to Newlyn, Cornwall where he worked in the recently established industrial school.Pearson was greatly influenced by William De Morgan (1839\u20131917) and there is some evidence that he worked in some capacity at De Morgan's workshop decorating tiles and pottery and making associated metalwork, for example tile mounts.Perhaps the most notable examples of Pearson's work are the four large copper plaques, earth, air, fire and water, that decorate the facade of Newlyn Art Gallery.  In addition to his time with De Morgan, as the senior metalworker at the Guild of Handicraft and at Newlyn, Pearson worked on his own account as a metalworker and decorating pottery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Pearson", "response": ["John Pearson may refer to:", "* John Pearson (VC) (1825\u20131892), recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* John Pearson (politician) (1802\u20131875), American judge and politician", "* John Pearson (footballer, born 1868) (1868\u20131931), English football player and referee", "* John Pearson (footballer, born 1892) (1892\u20131937), Scottish football player", "* John Pearson (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131979), English football player", "* John Pearson (footballer, born 1935), English football player", "*John Pearson (footballer, born 1946), English football player", "* John Pearson (footballer, born 1963), English football player", "* John Pearson (cricketer) (1915\u20132007), English cricketer", "*John Pearson (curler) (active 1959), Scottish curler", "* John Pearson (gymnast) (1902\u20131984), American gymnast", "* John Pearson (sport shooter) (1926\u20131994), British Olympic shooter", "* John Pearson, 3rd Viscount Cowdray (1910\u20131995), British peer, businessman and polo player", "* John Pearson (artist) (fl. 1885\u20131910), English master-craftsman", "* John Pearson (author) (1930\u20132021), British author ", "* John Pearson (bishop) (1613\u20131686), English theologian, scholar, and Bishop of Chester", "* John Pearson (judge) (1820\u20131886), British High Court justice and son of John Norman Pearson", "* John Pearson (surgeon) (1758\u20131826), British surgeon", "* John Pearson (advocate general) (1771\u20131841), Advocate General in British India", "* John Pearson (diplomat), British Ambassador to Laos"]}, {"page": "Newlyn", "response": ["*John Pearson, coppersmith"]}, {"page": "Newlyn Copper", "response": ["John Drew Mackenzie, an artist who settled at Newlyn was a key figure in setting up the Newlyn Industrial Class, assisted by the benefactor and local Member of Parliament, Thomas Bedford Bolitho, and artists Reginald Dick, T.
