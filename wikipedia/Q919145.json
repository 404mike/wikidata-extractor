It became the focus of British interest as a result of travels by the explorer David Livingstone, the first European to visit the area, in the 1860s. He was followed some years later by Verney Lovett Cameron who surveyed Lake Tanganyika. Livingstone inspired missionaries of the London Missionary Society to come in the 1880s to Niamkolo on the lake and Fwambo and Kawimbe on the plateau. These missions had links to the African Lakes Company which later set up in Mbala and Mpulungu. The area was ravaged by the slave trade during much of the 19th Century, and the African Lakes Company devoted some efforts to trying to stamp it out. This activity drew in the representative of the British Government in the region, Harry Johnston in Nyasaland, and decisions were taken to strengthen the imperial presence south of the lake and prevent other colonial powers establishing a foothold there."]}, {"page": "British diaspora in Africa", "response": ["*Verney Lovett Cameron (1844\u20131894), explorer"]}, {"page": "Lukuga River", "response": ["Verney Lovett Cameron reached the river at the point where it left the lake in May 1874 on his journey across Africa from east to west.

Lyme Regis was also the birthplace of the metallurgist, Percy Gilchrist and the ornithologist, artist and publisher, John Gould. Gould became the first curator of the Museum of Zoological Society, at the age of 22. The Gould League in Australia is named after him. The scientist and philosopher Robert Boyle, who is perhaps best known for Boyle's law, lived in Stalbridge Manor for a time; while the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace whose theory of evolution prompted Charles Darwin to publish his own theory; was also a resident of Dorset, and is buried at Broadstone.Hilliam (p19) Another naturalist, Thomas Bell, was born in Poole. Bell was professor of zoology at King's College, a lecturer in anatomy at Guy's Hospital and president of the Linnean Society.

Shortly after he left Zanzibar he learned that Livingstone had died, but continued to Ujiji. He circumnavigated Lake Tanganyika and found that it had its outlet to the west, feeding into a tributary of the Congo River. Cameron went on to the Atlantic, becoming one of the first Europeans to make an east-west crossing of Equatorial Africa. It was not until Stanley circumnavigated Lake Victoria in 1874\u20131875 that it was confirmed that the lake was the source of the White Nile. With Stanley's return to Zanzibar in 1877 the last of the main questions surrounding the Great Lakes drainage had been settled. Krapf had conjectured there was one great lake feeding the Congo, Zambezi, Nile and Benue. There had turned out to be three great lakes, feeding the Congo, Zambezi and Nile."]}, {"page": "Mrs. Lovett Cameron", "response": ["She married Henry Lovett Cameron who was a parliamentary agent in the Treasury in 1867.

As he explored, Cameron had made agreements with the local chiefs to allow the British to develop commerce. Britain was unwilling to ratify the agreements and annex the territory at the time, but the economic opportunity appealed to Leopold II of Belgium. In 1876, he hosted an International Geographical Conference at the Palais Royal in Brussels with the object of convincing the dignitaries of Europe that his motives for acquiring a colony in Africa were humanitarian and scientific. At the conference, to which he had invited those most involved in exploring and studying the geography of Africa,  Leopold proposed forming the International African Society, or the International Association for the Exploration and Civilization of the Congo to centralize and disseminate information about the efforts being made in Africa. The proposal was approved by the conference delegates and Leopold was elected president of the organization."]}]}}
