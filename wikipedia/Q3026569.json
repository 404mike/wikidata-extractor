Though questionable, the writer for the 1904 publication Famous Fights Past and Present, wrote that Sam's fight with Jones was a pre-arranged match and that Jones had decided to throw the fight.Famous Fights Past and Present, Volume 1, no. 4, edited by Harold Furniss, London, England, 1904, pg. 186  Both Jones and Sam were well known boxers at the time.  Jones appeared more muscular and likely stronger, though Young Dutch was noticeably the taller of the two competitors. The match was fought in the rain, and the well known bare-knuckle boxer Dick Curtis was Young Dutch's second.  In the tenth round Jones caught Sam around the neck and threw him to the ground.  This tactic, known as fibbing, would be illegal using today's Marquess of Queensbury rules.  The last blow in the 18th round was a right to the jaw, which ended the match in 53 minutes, as Jones did not wish to continue when his seconds attempted to lift him. The reporter for London's Morning Chronicle wrote that Jones showed less aggression in the final rounds, where Young Dutch Sam took the lead in the fighting.  Tellingly, Jones was frequently down which ended rounds thirteen through fifteen.\"Boxing, Fight Between Young Dutch Sam and Jones\", The Morning Post, London, England, pg. 3, 19 October 1825 The purse was set for \u00a325 a side, a considerable sum, for an early career match.\"Young Dutch Sam and Jones\", Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 3, 19 October 1825", "In a bout with Tom \"Gypsey\" Cooper in Gravesend in Essex close to the Thames on 25 April 1826, Sam was a clear winner in an eighteen round bout according to the Boxing Register, though London's Morning Post listed the match as lasting 5 rounds. The more detailed London Morning Chronicle listed the action in 15 rounds, a far more accurate tally.  Sam was the favorite in the betting at 2-1, for an early career purse of \u00a330 a side.  Gypsey Cooper was the brother of Jack Cooper who attended him at the match.  Sam took a clear lead, landing a right and left to Gypsey's mouth in the first that floored him, and floored Cooper again with a right and left at the end of the third.  In the sixth, Sam showed his ability to rush away from the blows of his opponents, as he had in earlier rounds.  In the tenth through the fifteenth Sam dominated, badly punishing his opponent.Five rounds for \u00a330 in \"Boxing, Dutch Sam and Gypsey Cooper\", The Morning Post,  London, England, pg. 3, 26 April 1826  Sam's habit of drawing his man to him, and then taking advantage of the closeness to punch with accuracy echoed the scientific boxing style of his primary mentor Dick Curtis.  Gypsey Cooper, though a stouter and somewhat more muscular opponent, left his head unguarded during his mad rushes which gave Young Dutch the opportunity to frequently connect with blows to this vital spot.\"Fight Between Young Dutch Sam and Tom Cooper, Remarks\", The Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 4, 26 April 1826", "Young Dutch defeated \"Gypsey\" Jack Cooper on 27 April 1827 in Andover, England in nine rounds.  Jack Cooper, like his brother Tom was of Gypsey stock, and described as dark, muscular and stocky.  Dick Curtis (boxer), there to support Sam, his friend and mentor, insisted on seconding the match despite having just completed a difficult bout with Barney Aaron.  According to Puglistica, Cooper had previously been sentenced to six months in jail for the death of Dan O'Leary, a recent opponent who had died from the ring injuries he inflicted.  It took Sam only 33 minutes to close Cooper's eyes and lacerate his face from repeated blows.
