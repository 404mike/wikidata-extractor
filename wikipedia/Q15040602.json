Six years after it opened, the restaurant gained its third Michelin star. La Tante Claire moved to The Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge, London, in 1998, with the former site being sold to become the flagship restaurant of Gordon Ramsay. During his time at La Tante Claire, Koffmann worked with several eminent chefs, including Ramsay, Marco Pierre White, Marcus Wareing and Tom Kitchin. He did not get on with Wareing, who made his feelings clear about Koffmann in Simon Wright's book Tough Cookies, saying of Koffmann, \"Three-star kitchen! This guy didn't tell you anything. He didn't tell you what the lunch menu was, he didn't tell you where to get anything\u2026 You didn't know if you were coming or going\u2026 I could not click with the man.\" More recently Wareing speaks better of Koffmann, saying \"Koffmann is a complete thoroughbred. He ran the kitchen from the stove.\" The signature dish of the restaurant was pig's trotter with chicken mousseline, sweetbreads and morels. Marco Pierre White has called this his \"favourite dish of all time\"."]}, {"page": "Wales on the Menu", "response": ["Wales on the Menu is a BBC Radio Wales series where restaurateur, writer and food critic Simon Wright challenges home cooks of Wales to get their dishes on the menu of top restaurants across the UK.
