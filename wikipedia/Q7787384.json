Francis's new partners were his eldest son Thomas (later to be Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet) and son-in-law, Charles Wall. Then, in 1802, Barings and Hope & Co. were called on to facilitate the largest land purchase in history: the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. It is regarded as \"one of the most historically significant trades of all time\". This was accomplished even though Britain was at war with France and the sale helped to finance Napoleon's war effort. Technically, the United States purchased Louisiana from Barings and Hope, not from Napoleon. Baring was willing to help Napoleon in the short term because he, and British politicians who backed him, predicted that American expansion into Louisiana would ensure Barings' profits in Britain. After a $3 million down payment in gold, the remainder of the purchase was made in United States bonds, which Napoleon sold to Barings through Hope & Co. of Amsterdam at a price of $87.50 per $100 face value (a discount of one-eighth). Francis's second son Alexander, working for Hope & Co., made the arrangements in Paris with Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois, director of the Public Treasury. Alexander then sailed to the United States and back to pick up the bonds and deliver them to France.", "Barings helped to finance the United States government during the War of 1812. By 1818, Barings was called \"the sixth great European power\", after England, France, Prussia, Austria and Russia. A fall off in business and some poor leadership in 1820s caused Barings to cede its dominance in the City of London to the rival firm of N M Rothschild & Sons. Barings remained a powerful firm, however, and in the 1830s the leadership of new American partner Joshua Bates, together with Thomas Baring, son of Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet, began a turnaround. Bates advocated a shift in Barings' efforts from Europe to the Americas, believing that greater opportunity lay in the West. In 1832, a Barings office was established in Liverpool specifically to capitalize on new North American opportunities. In 1843, Barings became exclusive agent to the US government, a position it held until 1871.", "In 1851, Baring and Bates brought in another American, Russell Sturgis, as partner. Despite the embarrassment to his partners caused by his sympathies for the South in the American Civil War, Sturgis proved a capable banker. After the death of Bates in 1864, he gradually assumed a leadership role in the firm. In the 1850s and 1860s, commercial credit business provided the firm with its \"bread and butter\" income. Thomas Baring's nephew Edward, son of Henry Baring, became a partner in 1856. By the 1870s, under the emerging leadership of \"Ned\" Baring, later the 1st Baron Revelstoke, Barings were increasingly involved in international securities, especially from the United States, Canada, and Argentina. Barings cautiously and successfully ventured into the North American railroad boom following the Civil War. A new railroad town in British Columbia was renamed Revelstoke, in honour of the leading partner of the bank that enabled the completion of the Canadian-Pacific Railway. Barings also helped to finance major railways including Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway."]}, {"page": "Baron Northbrook", "response": ["* Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet (1772\u20131848)", "* Francis Thomas Baring, 6th Baron Northbrook (born 1954)"]}, {"page": "Great Yarmouth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Baring"]}, {"page": "Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Baring || Conservative", "|Thomas Baring ||Conservative "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Thomas Baring||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Thomas Baring", "response": ["Thomas Baring may refer to:", "*Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet (1772\u20131848), British MP for High Wycombe and Hampshire", "*Thomas Baring (1799\u20131873), British banker and MP for Huntingdon, 1844\u20131873", "*Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook (1826\u20131904), English statesman"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868\u20131885)", "response": ["|Thomas Baring"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1868 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Baring"]}, {"page": "Thomas Baring (1799-1873)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Baring (1799\u20131873)"]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet (12 June 1772 \u2013 3 April 1848), was a British banker and Member of Parliament.", "* Thomas Baring (1799\u20131873), a banker and MP for Great Yarmouth and Huntingdon.", "Thomas Baring"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Thomas Baring||10/06/1841||12 June 1772 \u2013 3 April 1848", "| Thomas Baring||07/06/1860||7 September 1799 \u2013 18 November 1873"]}, {"page": "Baring family properties", "response": ["Sir Thomas Baring (1772\u20131848)", "Sir Thomas Baring (1772\u20131848)", "| Thomas Baring (1799\u20131873)"]}, {"page": "Baring (surname)", "response": ["*Thomas Baring (1799\u20131873), English banker and Conservative MP", "*Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook (1826\u20131904), British Viceroy of India and politician"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1832\u20131847)", "response": ["|Thomas Baring"]}, {"page": "1873 Huntingdon by-election", "response": ["The Huntingdon by-election of 1873 was fought on 17 December 1873.
