Initially organised by the Official Supporters Club the award was voted for by their members although it was presented as an official club award.  In recent years the award has been presented at a gala 'End of Season' award ceremony and dinner, usually held at the end of April, and voting has been widened to include a broader section of the club's fanbase.  The first winner of the award was long serving goalkeeper Alan Hodgkinson. The player with the most award wins is striker Alan Woodward on four occasions between 1970 and 1978.  The longest gap between wins by a player is seven years; Keith Edwards had two spells with the club and won the award during both, in 1977 and 1984. Harry Maguire and Phil Jagielka have won the award on three consecutive occasions. The award was shared between two players for the first time in 2017, with Billy Sharp and John Fleck receiving the award."]}, {"page": "England national football team records and statistics", "response": ["; Most non-playing selections for the World Cup finalsOf these players, only David James played in a World Cup finals match at any other tournament (2010).
