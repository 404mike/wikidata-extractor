Jad Adams calls the novel richly revealing even though it was badly reviewed, especially its man-loving and misogynistic undercurrents. He calls it \"... a metaphor for the failing gallantry of 19th-century man confronting the new woman.\" Andrew Lycett, in his biography of Kipling, called it a \"grown-up novel by an emotionally immature man.\" It has been variously derided as \"sentimental, unstructured, melodramatic, chauvinistic, and implausible.\" Kipling himself admitted in his autobiography that the novel was a conte (short tale of adventure) and not a built book. Lord Birkenhead calls the novel a \"rotten apple\" among Kipling's other published works."]}, {"page": "Joan Shenton", "response": ["In the late 1980s, together with Meditel's producer Jad Adams, Meditel made two network six-part series about food, Food \u2013 Fad or Fact?, co-produced with Tom Goodison of Television South West.
