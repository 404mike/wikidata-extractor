He has also played List A and T20 cricket for Lancashire.\nMaiden was born in Glasgow and attended Hutchesons' Grammar School, before going on to study at Loughborough University along with fellow Scotland cricketers Fraser Watts and Simon Smith. After three years, he graduated with a 2.1 honours degree in Sports Science.\nA frontline batter and off-spin bowler, Gregor had a nomadic club career, having spells with several clubs in the West of Scotland and a brief stint at Lancashire (he suffered a cruciate ligament injury shortly after signing for them), until in 2004 he signed for the popular Grange club in Edinburgh, where he has played since.\nIn his only List A appearance for Lancashire CCC, in 2003 vs India 'A', his stand of 130 (Maiden scored 62) alongside Chris Schofield created a List A World Record for the Highest 9th Wicket Partnership.  The record has since been beaten by Chris Read and Andrew Harris in 2006.\nGregor can also lay claim to being a genuine all-rounder, as in 2005 he became one of few players in the history of the game to have batted, bowled and kept wicket for his country when he took the gloves for a crucial ICC Intercontinental Cup clash. In the final season of his international career, during 2011, Maiden was Scotland's first choice wicketkeeper in CB40 and ODI matches.\nAfter his cricketing career, Maiden worked in the banking sector in Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maiden (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Gregor Maiden (born 1979), Scottish cricketer"]}, {"page": "Scottish Saltires in 2005", "response": ["*  Gregor Maiden"]}, {"page": "2005 ICC Trophy", "response": ["* Gregor Maiden"]}, {"page": "Scotland national under-19 cricket team", "response": ["* 9 \u2013 Gregor Maiden (1998), Chris West (2002), Aman Bailwal (2012), Chayank Gosain (2014"]}, {"page": "2007 ICC World Twenty20 squads", "response": ["|| 5 || Gregor Maiden || 22 July 1979 || 0 || Right || Right arm off break ||  Grange"]}, {"page": "2010 ICC World Cricket League Division One", "response": ["Gregor Maiden"]}, {"page": "Charlie Holcomb", "response": ["In 1999, Holcomb made a single List-A appearance for Dorset against Scotland in the 2nd round of the 1999 NatWest Trophy.
