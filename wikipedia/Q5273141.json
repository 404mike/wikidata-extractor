The following season, he began to repay Haworth's faith in him as the goals came on a regular basis; a 2\u20131 victory over Wolves on 23 December saw Freeman score his twentieth goal of the season in only the nineteenth game, and he followed this with a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 defeat of Glossop North End a week later. By the end of March, Freeman's goals had helped Burnley to the top of the table with a seven-point margin over third placed Derby County with five games to play and promotion seemed secured. The absence, however, of winger Dick Lindley contributed to the club only collecting three more points and Burnley missed out on promotion finishing two points behind second place Chelsea. For Freeman, however, there was the satisfaction of finishing as the league's top scorer with 32 goals from 33 appearances and returning to the England side."]}, {"page": "Oswaldtwistle Rovers F.C.", "response": ["Former players who also played professionally in the English Football League include Tommy Becton, Martin Dunne, Proctor Hall, Kelly Houlker, Dick Lindley and George Parsonage."]}, {"page": "Lindley (surname)", "response": ["* Dick Lindley, English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Richard Lindley (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dick Lindley"]}, {"page": "Richard Lindley", "response": ["*Dick Lindley, English footballer"]}]}}
