His best known work is The Apocalypse: Expounded by Scripture (1861\u201365), which he wrote under a pen name. Wilbur M. Smith said about it: \"One of the profoundest expositions of the book of Revelation that I know of is the work of Robert Govett. My own opinion is that he brings to his interpretation a more thorough knowledge of the Scriptures in their bearing on the last book of the Bible than any other writer of his generation.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
