Born in Cambridge and raised in Start Hill, Essex, she began posting songs on Myspace in 2008, which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse raves. In 2010, she signed a recording contract with Asylum Records, releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and 2012.\nIn 2012, Charli XCX rose to prominence with the Icona Pop collaboration \"I Love It\", which became an international success, reaching top 10 in North America and Europe. Her debut studio album, True Romance (2013), was released that year to critical acclaim but failed to meet commercial expectations. In 2014, she contributed the hook and bridge to \"Fancy\" by rapper Iggy Azalea, which finished the year as one of the best-selling singles worldwide and was nominated for two Grammy Awards. The same year, Charli XCX released \"Boom Clap\", which became her first solo top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100. Her second studio album, the punk-influenced Sucker, was released at the end of the year, and spawned the successful singles \"Break the Rules\" and \"Doing It\".\nIn 2015, Charli XCX began working alongside producers associated with the UK collective PC Music, developing a more experimental sound and image. While working on her third album, she released the Vroom Vroom EP (2016) and the mixtapes Number 1 Angel and Pop 2 (both 2017), as well as a series of singles including the BPI-certified \"After the Afterparty\", \"Boys\", and \"1999\". Her third and fourth studio albums, Charli (2019) and How I'm Feeling Now (2020), received widespread acclaim; the latter was created within a span of six weeks during the COVID-19 lockdowns. In 2021, Charli XCX co-wrote and provided vocals on the Jax Jones and Joel Corry single \"Out Out\". The singer's fifth album, Crash, is scheduled for release in March 2022.\nIn addition to her solo work, Charli XCX has co-written songs for other artists, including Iggy Azalea's \"Beg for It\" (2014), Selena Gomez's \"Same Old Love\" (2015), Blondie's \"Tonight\" (2017), and the Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello collaboration \"Se\u00f1orita\" (2019).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 2", "response": ["*1992 \u2013 Charli XCX, English singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "Britney Spears", "response": ["Spears and her work have influenced various artists including Katy Perry, Meghan Trainor, Demi Lovato, Kelly Key, Kristinia DeBarge, Little Boots, Charli XCX, Marina Diamandis, The Weeknd, Tegan and Sara, Pixie Lott, Grimes, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Pabllo Vittar, Tinashe, Victoria Justice, Cassie, Leah Wellbaum of Slothrust, The Saturdays, Normani, Miley Cyrus, Cheryl, Lana Del Rey, Ava Max, Billie Eilish, Sam Smith, and Rina Sawayama.
