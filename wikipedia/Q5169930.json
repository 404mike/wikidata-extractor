It was almost as if she knew that she was not going to be the grand lady of Scottish art.\" Murdo Macdonald says of Eardley's Catterline seascapes: \"[S]he committed herself to understanding the sea more than any other painter since William McTaggart in the 1890s. Rather than just responding to the attraction of the coastline, she painted with the perception of a mariner aware that waves are heavy, fast moving lumps of water, as able to kill as to support. In this she reinvigorated a maritime trend in Scottish art...\"Murdo Macdonald, 'Scottish Art', London: Thames and Hudson, 2000: pp192\u20133 One of her biographers, Cordelia Oliver, observed that, \"for her a truly successful painting had to go deeper than a mere visual record, no matter how accurate...
