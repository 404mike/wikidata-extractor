He held the seat only until Parliament was dissolved later that year for the 1885 general election, when the two-seat Antrim constituency was divided into four single-member divisions. Sinclair stood in North Antrim, where in a three-way contest he was defeated by the Conservative Edward MacNaghten.When the Liberal Party split in 1886 over Irish Home Rule, Sinclair joined with the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party, and was elected at the 1886 general election as MP for Falkirk Burghs in Scotland, with a majority of only 19 votes (0.4% of the total) over the Liberal Party candidate. He lost the seat to the Liberals at the 1892 general election, and did not stand for Parliament again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Falkirk Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|  William Pirrie Sinclair"]}, {"page": "Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|William Pirrie Sinclair"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Pirrie Sinclair"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868\u20131885)", "response": ["|William Pirrie Sinclair"]}, {"page": "William Sinclair", "response": ["* William Pirrie Sinclair (1837\u20131900), MP for Antrim and Falkirk Burghs"]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|William Pirrie Sinclair"]}, {"page": "1885 Antrim by-election", "response": ["The Liberals chose William Pirrie Sinclair, a 38-year-old, Belfast born merchant and ship owner with business interests in Glasgow, Liverpool and elsewhere.The Times, 8 July 1886 p10"]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Unionist Party MPs", "response": ["|William Pirrie Sinclair"]}, {"page": "Pirrie", "response": ["*William Pirrie Sinclair (1837\u20131900), politician in the United Kingdom, twice elected to the House of Commons"]}]}}
