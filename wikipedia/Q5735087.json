This association which lasted for nearly a decade extended from an interest in archaeology to herbal medicines, and plants. He began to study Hooker's First Book of  Botany and learned to prepare herbarium specimens. Bhagwan Lal then suggested that Indraji meet Dr Sakharam Arjun, botany professor at Grant Medical College. He began to identify plants and learn botany from Sakharam Arjun and  preparing  herbarium  specimens of plants from around Bombay. He gradually became acquainted with many other naturalists including Herbert Mills Birdwood, Chester MacNaghten, Principal of the Rajkumar College at Rajkot, James Macnabb Campbell and Dr D. MacDonald who succeeded Dr Sakharam Arjun at the Grant Medical College. After the death of Dr Arjun, Indraji was in contact with his adopted daughter Rukhmabai who introduced indraji to the botanist Dr J.C. Lisboa.Shah (1999):18. When MacNaghten went on holidays he sought the ethno-botanical assistance of Indraji and along with Dr MacDonald, they made visits to Matheran to study the flora. Rustomjee Khory made use of Indraji's assistance paying Rupees 30 a month while producing his Materia Medica but did not acknowledge his help.", "thumb|Title page of Indraji's 1910 book on the Flora of Barda Mountain|alt=|leftHerbert Mills Birdwood and MacNaghten attempted to help Indraji obtain a suitable employment but Indraji would not accept working with anyone but Bhagwan Lal. Through MacNaghten, the Maharaja of Porbander offered assistance for Indraji to study the flora of the Barda mountain. Frederick Styles Philpin Lely, the British administrator for Porbander also supported the project and Indraji was appointed as Curator of Forests and Gardens of the state of Porbander on 1 October 1886. Initially Indraji declined the offer as the salary was Rupees 100 a month but on the influence of MacNaghten and Lely this was increased to 200 and he took the offer. Jayakrishna worked with the local shepherd community, the Rabaris, to collect ethnobotanical information. One of his studies was on the lethal effects of Indigofera cordifolia on sheep that grazed them shortly after the rains. He worked for 19 years in the region and produced his magnum opus, on the Flora of Barda Mountain only in 1910. Although he was persuaded to write it in English, he chose to write it in Gujarati and titled it \"Vanaspati \u015a\u0101stra, A Complete  and  Comprehensive  Account  of  the Flora of Barda Mountain\". He wrote: \"Europeans placed in their countries know and write about the plants of this country, and my countrymen would not know about the plants in their courtyard and those trampled under their feet. I will write the book in my mother tongue\". When the manuscript of the book was ready, the Maharaja of Porbander had died and there was no monetary support for it.  Finding a publisher was difficult. He once met Lalshankar Umashankar on a train and the latter offered to print the book through the Gujarat Vernacular Society on the condition that he removed the dedication page to the King of Porbander State. Indraji refused to accept the condition. He finally printed it at his own cost, pawning some of his wife's jewellery, and only a 1000 copies were printed with many left unsold that forced him to halve the price. He retired and moved to Kutch where the Maharaja of Kutch took an interest and made him Superintendent of the Palace and made him in-charge of reforestation and planting. He promoted the use of tree planting to block the expansion of dunes and wrote a book Plants of Kutch and Their Utility (1926) which included 99 line drawings."]}]}}
