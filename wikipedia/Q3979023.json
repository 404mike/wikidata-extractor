They were beaten 3\u20131 by Bishop Auckland in the final of the FA Amateur Cup in April 1957. Their North-East rivals were something of a nemesis having also beaten the Chairboys at the semi-final stage in both 1950 and 1955.

Assets were transferred to a limited company, something which was unusual for the time. In addition, the main stand was constructed, which today holds over 700 spectators. It was not until George Smith became manager that success returned; the Athenian League title was won for the third time in 1958 and the club won the London Senior Cup for the first time. Progress continued into the 60s under Sid Cann in Sutton's most successful period. In 1963, the club reached Wembley in the FA Amateur Cup, but lost 4\u20132 to Wimbledon.", "*Sid Cann, manager 1962\u20131974, during which period the club reached two FA Amateur Cup finals"]}, {"page": "Willie Brown (footballer, born 1900)", "response": ["Brown joined Torquay United in 1928.
