Prior to joining the philosophy department of NYU in 1997, he taught at the University of Edinburgh, University of California, Irvine, University of Michigan and UCLA. The author of several books and dozens of articles in international academic journals, he has made notable contributions to the fields of philosophical logic, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language and also has written on ancient philosophy, in particular on Aristotle's account of logic and modality.\nHe is also a Distinguished Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy, University of Birmingham, UK. Since 2018 Fine is Visiting Professor at the University of Italian Switzerland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vagueness", "response": ["Another theoretical approach is known as \"supervaluationism\". This approach has been defended by Kit Fine and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of \"truth value gaps\". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be \"made precise\" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.Kit Fine, The Limits of Abstraction (2002)"]}, {"page": "Anne Fine", "response": ["Fine was born and raised in Leicester and educated in neighbouring midland counties of England. She attended Northampton High School and earned a degree in politics from the University of Warwick.

She currently lives in Barnard Castle, County Durham, England. She and Kit Fine have two daughters named Cordelia Fine and Ione Fine."]}, {"page": "Relevance logic", "response": ["The conditional fragment of R is sound and complete with respect to the class of semilattice models. The logic with conjunction and disjunction is properly stronger than the conditional, conjunction, disjunction fragment of R. In particular, the formula (A\\to(B\\lor C))\\land(B\\to C)\\to (A\\to C) is valid for the operational models but it is invalid in R. The logic generated by the operational models for R has a complete axiomatic proof system, due Kit Fine and to Gerald Charlwood. Charlwood also provided a natural deduction system for the logic, which he proved equivalent to the axiomatic system. Charlwood showed that his natural deduction system is equivalent to a system provided by Dag Prawitz."]}, {"page": "Arthur Prior", "response": ["During his time at Oxford, Prior met Peter Geach and William Kneale, influenced John Lemmon, and corresponded with the adolescent Saul Kripke.
