The CD single features six different versions of the song, including three remixes. \"Ouch\" has been defined as the response single to the group's second single \"I Swear\" as both songs deal with the issue of cheating within a relationship. The key difference between the two tracks is that \"Ouch\" involves the man in the relationship cheating whereas in \"I Swear\" it's the woman. In contrast the track's accompanied music video, which leaked four month's prior to the song's single release, tells the same story as the song lyrics. The song reached the B-list on BBC Radio 1. The single reached a peak of #22 on the UK Singles Chart making it the second consecutive single by the group to peak within the top thirty.http://www.polyhex.com \"Ouch\" combines elements of pop, British hip hop as well as R&B or blue-eyed soul. The song is accompanied by backing that combines both a violin and a piano melody. As with all N-Dubz songs, it was penned by the group themselves with group member, Fazer being credited for its production. The song is slow to mid-paced and features Tulisa taking on high and emotive vocals throughout the song. Dappy raps in the verses with Fazer rapping towards the end. The whole structure of the track revolves around a call-and-response argument between two lovers who in this case are played by the group members. The track is also significantly different from other N-Dubz songs in the sense that the song is opened with Tulisa singing the first verse as aposed to their regular tradition of Dappy opening the song rapping. The group planned on releasing the track much earlier than they did, but due to conflict with previous label Polydor Records they were unable to until they were signed with All Around The World. We came to a standstill after the MOBO\u2019s because we were having problems with the label and we weren\u2019t agreeing on the path they chose for us. We kept bringing them singles like Ouch and they said \u2018No, we don\u2019t like it!\u2019 and they kept trying to put us with new writers, with new producers.

It's all about a whole debate between a woman and man after finding out the mans cheated. It's just a whole storyline, the whole aftermath of it. The video's got a whole storyline too that people can relate to.

Tulisa is visible singing on a balcony which looks over the city as wind blows through her hair. After entering the house, Tulisa walks up the staircase as she sings and uses hand gestures to perform the 'One step, two step, three step, four' lyric. She then walks into her bedroom only to find her boyfriend (not Fazer) in their bed with another woman, the woman then gets upset and shouts \"Name's Shaniqua and what?\" which has become a famous catchphrase for N-Dubz. Her boyfriend and Tulisa then start pushing each other around out of frustration from the situation. Tulisa starts throwing house objects at Fazer, who wears numerous types of outfits throughout the music video. Dappy is also seen performing on a rooftop. In the next scene, Tulisa takes her bag and gets into the car and starts driving whilst Fazer is holding onto the car, upset, and trying to stop her from driving away.

It is both written and produced by the group and  Jack Freegard. The song features vocals and rapping by all three of N-Dubz's members: Dappy, Tulisa and Fazer. The song's intro and chorus are rapped by Dappy and Tulisa is involved in the backing vocals and reply verse of the song. The song then ends off with a verse rapped by Fazer. The general theme of the song is about growing up, the difficulties of it and how to use it to make you stronger. The lyrics involve stereotyping and the discriminating of \"untalented\" scholars or kids who never completed their school career. Examples of this include Dappy's verse, \"Just because I neva went to school don't mean I can't be perfect\". Tulisa's reply verse involves the difficulty that girls face during their school years and how jealousy more often than not results in conflict in competitive situations at school with lyrics such as \"So much hate, lies an deceit\" describing the extent of the conflict of these situations between girls at school. The second half of the song is aimed inspiring the song's listener, from the personal experience of the group, to not take notice of the difficulties of life but rather to rise above it despite what people say. An example of this is found in the line \"I love my Nike Air, but now movin onto Gucci and Prada\". The single was released and re-released before making the group's debut album, \"Uncle B\" and therefore didn't have an effect on the album's sales which were first boosted by the group's later single \"Ouch\" in 2008. The re-release of the song featured a significantly shorter version of the original; the re-release version being 03:30 long and the original 05:10. Tulisa's view on the re-release of the song: I think re-releasing \"Better Not Waste My Time\" was a mistake Polydor made because they weren't aiming at our main fanbase, they were reaching out for a new fanbase. It did gain us new fans, but at the same time, we missed out on how many thousands of fans we already had, because we didn't bring out a fresh track.  \"You Better Not Waste My Time\" is featured as the second track on N-Dubz's setlist for their Uncle B Tour.", "N-Dubz created two music videos for \"You Better Not Waste My Time\". The first and original video was self-funded by the group by themselves but as part of the single's re-release promotion under Polydor Records a new video was remade, making it the second and official music video for the track.

The explicit version of the song is used in this version of the video. The second video starts off with a dancer dancing in the dark, then Dappy lighting a match.

The general style of the song is an upbeat hip-hop backing combined with the soulful vocals of Tulisa and the intensive rapping of Dappy forming an original British hip-hop grime track which's style is reflected in the forthcoming album tracks and singles that appeared on N-Dubz's debut album \"Uncle B\". The song prominently features the two more common participants of N-Dubz in the singing and rapping of their songs: Tulisa and Dappy, with Fazer featuring as backing vocals and/or grunting throughout the song as well as in the final verse where he raps about how he caught his girlfriend cheating on him when he arrived home from tour. The first verse is rapped by Dappy with Tulisa in backing. This follows onto a call and response chorus between both Dappy and Tulisa. Verse two is led by Tulisa with Dappy in backing and the track is called-out with N-Dubz's signatures call-outs \"It's N-Dubz N-Dubz, what ye, it's N-Dubz N-Dubz, two thousand and sexy naa naa nii\" - rapped by Dappy and \"Uh-oh uh-oh\" sung by Tulisa. The song's general theme involves infidelity, a theme which is later followed on by the group's 2008 single \"Ouch\". The song, through its lyrics, tells a story about how a man discovers that after his girlfriend starts regularly giving him the cold shoulder that she's in fact cheating on him. It's mentioned that he sees his girlfriend kissing another guy under a bridge and when he arrives home from tour he suspiciously finds a pair of Nike shoes that don't belong to him whilst his girlfriend is at home. The story of the lyrics goes on into an argument between the couple and the girlfriend admits that she didn't go chillin' with her girl-friends but did, as accused cheat on him.

Ukmusic.com reviewed the single \"I Swear\" is set to ignite both underground and commercial radio alike. The track is very in your face with both Dappy and Fazer threatening the so-called 'cheater'. Tulisa however, neutralises \"I Swear\" with her melodic harmonies that overall make it a great tune to listen to. It certainly becomes catchier after multiple listens. Dappy's voice is truly amazing and edits a very comical essence into the chorus. Ciao.co.uk also positively reviewed the song, claiming it had a great beat and fantastic sound. N-Dubz's sound really comes into its own in this track. Their slightly crazy voices work so well on the chorus.

It then moves onto Dappy being tied to a chair being teased by a girl, correlating with the lyrics \"I miss the time when you would tie me to a chair, tease me from the back of my neck up to my ear\". From this scene, which is repeated throughout the video in different ways, the video moves onto a scene under a bridge where a woman is kissing a man - correlating with the lyrics of Dappy's lines in the song. Furthermore, the scene then evolves into Dappy discovering the couple's secret at the scene of the crime, he is then angered by it and attacks the man. At the chorus of the song, the scene is shifted to in and around a city bridge. This is the setting for the majority of the video and mainly in the song's choruses. Tulisa then reappears wearing black sunglasses and white summer outfit. The scene is then shifted to a home for the second verse which is sung by Tulisa and features Tulisa pleading to her boyfriend and then also teasing him while he's tied to a chair. During Fazer's verse, the video showcases him walking into his home, arriving from tour, discovering a pair of Nike shoes which don't belong to him, whilst his girlfriend is in bed with another man. As Fazer walks up the stairs, his girlfriend tells the man in her bed to go hide. Just when she thinks her secret is safe, Fazer confronts her about the Nike shoes and an argument develops which later results in her secret being exposed.
