[...] Like all great tragedies, it contains more than any summary can say. Its meaning is not merely a moral statement; its meaning is the play itself: its imagery and words, its lacunae and aporias.\" In a 2012 article for The Guardian, April De Angelis listed Far Away as one of the \"landmark\" Churchill plays. Billington listed it in 2014 as one of the five greatest works of dystopian drama, arguing that \"even if there is something abrupt about the transition from political brutalism to natural disorder, the play defiantly endures.\" Mary Leland of The Irish Times gave a 2017 Spike Island performance a full five stars.
