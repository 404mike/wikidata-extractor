Reporting on Rogers' winning the Pritzker Prize in 2007, The New York Times noted that the design of the Centre \"turned the architecture world upside down\". The Pritzker jury said the Pompidou \"revolutionized museums, transforming what had once been elite monuments into popular places of social and cultural exchange, woven into the heart of the city.\" Mitterrand, seeing the passion that went into the building project and having a will to produce the best possible buildings, pursued his Grands Projets based on similar architectural competitions which would attract architects from a wide field to develop the city to its architectural potential."]}]}}
