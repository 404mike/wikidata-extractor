Two years later, Abu Bakar moved the administrative headquarters to Tanjung Puteri, and officially renamed it as Johor Bahru.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365\u20131941), pg 145 A new administration was set up, which was modelled after European styles and certain elements of a traditional Malay government. He recruited some of his close relatives and his classmates from the Teluk Blanga Malay school into the bureaucracy, and also set up an advisory council which included two Chinese leaders. In the early 1870s, Straits Governor Sir Harry Ord said of Abu Bakar (who became a Maharaja in 1868) that he was the \"only Raja in the whole peninsula or adjoining states who rules in accordance with the practice of civilized nations.\"Andaya, A History of Malaysia, pg 152", "Abu Bakar was also the first Malay ruler to visit Europe in 1866.Miller, A Short History of Malaysia, pg 89 He was an Anglophile, and mingled comfortably with the Europeans.

Malaysian Branch, Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, pg 181 Abu Bakar had gained his share of critics, especially among the more conservative Malay scholars who were critical of his Western tastes. Abu Bakar's penchant for an extravagant lifestyle and foreign travel resulted in a depleted state treasury at the time of his death in 1895. At least one scholar, Nesalmar Nadarajah, had suggested that Johor's loss of independence in the early 20th century was attributed to this depleted state treasury. In addition, Nadarajah also believed that the loss of Johor's independence was also attributed to Abu Bakar's failure of giving attention to his young son, Tunku Ibrahim, who lacked proper education and training in the art of state administration and diplomacy when he succeeded his father as the Sultan of Johor in his early twenties.Nadarajah, Johore and the Origins of British Control, pg 188"]}, {"page": "Harry (given name)", "response": ["* Harry Ord (1819\u20131885), British colonial administrator "]}]}}
