There had been six in Upper Canada (modern-day Ontario) and several more in Lower Canada (modern-day Quebec) and the Maritimes. The first such commission was convened in 1827 at the order of F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich, and headed by Henry Darling (not to be confused with his son, Charles Henry Darling). That commission delivered its final report on July 24, 1828, and inaugurated the colonial policy of attempting to \"civilize\" Indigenous peoples. Another commission, conducted by James Buchanan Macaulay; Robert Sympson Jameson; and William Hepburn, registrar of the Court of Chancery, had concluded in 1840, just two years before the Bagot commission began."]}]}}
