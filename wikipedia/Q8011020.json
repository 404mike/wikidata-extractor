His method of developing the watercolor painting in stages, starting with large, vague color areas established on wet paper, then refining the image through a sequence of washes and glazes, permitted him to produce large numbers of paintings with \"workshop efficiency\" and made him a multimillionaire, partly by sales from his personal art gallery, the first of its kind. Among the important and highly talented contemporaries of Turner and Girtin were John Varley, John Sell Cotman, Anthony Copley Fielding, Samuel Palmer, William Havell, and Samuel Prout. The Swiss painter Abraham-Louis-Rodolphe Ducros was also widely known for his large format, romantic paintings in watercolor."]}, {"page": "Tintern Abbey", "response": ["Not all visitors to the Abbey ruins were shocked by the intrusion of industry, however.

Benezit Dictionary of Artists (2006) has Daniel and Robert as brothers. The Grove Dictionary of Art (1999/2006) hedges, writing that \"According to their descendants, Robert was undeniably Daniel's son, though there is evidence to suggest that he may have been his uncle.\" but more recent references generally place him as born in 1785, the son of Luke's brother Thomas, also a painter, who was born in 1762. Daniel moved to London, and set up in partnership as an aquatint engraver with Robert Havell.  Together they published aquatints of Twenty Four Views Taken in St. Helena (1809\u201310) after pictures by Henry Salt, and Twelve Picturesque Views of the River Thames (1812) from watercolours by William Havell.  But the partnership did not last, and soon Daniel was working independently, including plates for Rudolph Ackermann's History of Cambridge (1815) and Ackermann's history of various Public Schools including Eton, Winchester and Rugby (1816), as well as a celebrated view of St Paul's Cathedral (1818) and various other London landmarks for Ackermann's Repository of Arts.
