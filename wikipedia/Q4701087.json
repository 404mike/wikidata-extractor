Known locally in North West England as Purple Aki, he is a 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall bodybuilder who weighs 22 st (310 lb; 140 kg).According to the Daily Mirror, Arobieke became known for \"approaching younger males and striking up conversations about weight training, before touching and measuring their muscles, and then inviting them to squat his body weight\". His criminal activities were originally ruled as sexually motivated, a fact which was recognised in 2006 by Liverpool Magistrates' Court when Merseyside Police successfully applied to them for a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. However, this was lifted in May 2016, and Arobieke has never been convicted of a sexual offence.On 12 September 2016 BBC Three published an online documentary about Arobieke called The Man Who Squeezes Muscles: Searching for Purple Aki. Later that year, he made an allegation against the BBC of incitement to racial hatred, complaining to Merseyside Police that the documentary was racist and had demonised him.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crumpsall", "response": ["Akinwale Arobieke known as Purple Aki, an English convicted criminal was born in Crumpsall."]}, {"page": "Toxteth", "response": ["*Akinwale Arobieke, muscle-feeler"]}, {"page": "New Brighton railway station", "response": ["In 1986, Gary Kelly, a 16-year-old boy, died from electrocution at the station after fleeing from Akinwale Arobieke, known locally as Purple Aki, who was believed to have been intimidating him.
