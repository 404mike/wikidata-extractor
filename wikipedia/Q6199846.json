He made his name in schools football, as inside right and playmaker in the Brierley Hill, Sedgley & District Schools team that reached the final of the English Schools' Football Association Trophy in 1951. Cochrane, together with his schools' team captain and future England international Trevor Smith, joined Birmingham City in the summer of 1951, and signed professional forms when he turned 17.He made his first-team debut on 7 March 1953, aged 17 years 4 months, in the Second Division match at Huddersfield Town which finished 1\u20131, and kept his place for the next game. On his next appearance, a year later, standing in for Wales international Noel Kinsey, Cochrane scored the opening goal in a 2\u20130 win home win against West Ham United. His progress was interrupted by his National Service commitment; after two years spent as a cook, he returned to the club overweight and unfit, and never played for the first team again.In June 1958 Cochrane joined Fourth Division club Walsall as part of Brian Taylor's transfer to Birmingham. He scored once in six league games before dropping into non-league football at the end of the 1958\u201359 season with Wellington Town and then Stourbridge. He was still only 23.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Taylor (footballer, born 1937)", "response": ["He moved to First Division club Birmingham City in June 1958 in exchange for \u00a310,000 and the inside-forward Jimmy Cochrane. Manager Arthur Turner described him as a \"wonderful prospect\". He scored six goals from 30 appearances in the 1958\u201359 season. Each of the six was the last goal of its match: his first top-flight goal, \"tearing through straight from the second-half kick-off\", helped earn his club a draw at Portsmouth, the other five all came in comfortable wins.Matthews, pp. 193\u201396, 241\u201342. Having come into the first team early in the 1959\u201360 season when Gordon Astall was injured in the home defeat of Newcastle United, Taylor suffered double vision in the reverse fixture a week later and was out for a month. He was selected regularly during October by manager Pat Beasley until a broken leg, sustained in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-final win over Union Saint-Gilloise in mid-November, kept him out for a year. Though he returned to the first team, the injury had robbed him of much of his pace. He scored on his return, against Manchester United, and made 24 appearances during the remainder of the season, sharing the outside-left position with Billy Rudd: Taylor was preferred on a heavy pitch."]}, {"page": "James Cochrane", "response": ["James or Jimmy Cochrane may refer to:", "*Jimmy Cochrane (footballer, born 1935), English football forward for Birmingham and Walsall", "*Jimmy Cochrane (footballer, born 1954), Scottish football fullback for Middlesbrough, Darlington and Torquay"]}]}}
