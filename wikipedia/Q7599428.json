The prevailing judicial philosophy is that of deference to Parliament.. This is despite the courts' general adoption of Lord Diplock's arguably pro-rights stand taken in the case of Ong Ah Chuan v.

This Privy Council case stated that judges should give constitutional provisions a generous interpretation to avoid the \"austerity of tabulated legalism\" and to provide individuals with their full measure of fundamental liberties.Ong Ah Chuan, [1979\u20131980] S.L.R.(R.) at 721, para. 23; [1981] 1 A.C. at 661, citing Minister of Home Affairs v. Fisher [1980] A.C. 319 at 328, P.C. (on appeal from Bermuda). The words \"austerity of tabulated legalism\", left unattributed by Lord Wilberforce in Fisher, appear to be those of Stanley Alexander de Smith: see , cited in . The generally deferential stance of the courts shows an inclination towards a strict separation of powers based upon the judiciary's belief that the Parliament is the only organ with the moral legitimacy to decide issues relating to social policy.See Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 10 at 18\u201319, para. 21, H.C. (Singapore), wherein the Chief Justice opined that the judiciary does not have the moral legitimacy to interfere in the affairs of Parliament, considering the fact that the Parliament has been voted into power by the people of Singapore via legitimate voting processes."]}, {"page": "De Smith", "response": ["*Stanley Alexander de Smith (1922\u20131974), English academic lawyer and author"]}, {"page": "Buganda Agreement (1955)", "response": ["Following a successful Bugandan delegation to London, new negotiations on the future of Baganda took place in June to September 1954 at Namirembe, with the Australian Sir Keith Hancock (Director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies in London) acting as the mediator and Stanley Alexander de Smith as Secretary. Initially, Hancock met solely with a constitutional committee selected by the Lukiiko. The four main issues considered by the committee were the degree to which Buganda was 'independent' under the 1900 Agreement; the balance between federalism versus the need to preserve a unitary Ugandan state; the role of the Kabaka; and the participation of Buganda in the Uganda Legislative Council (LEGCO). Discussions were lengthy, and while there was some progress, it was clear to Hancock that the Committee in particular held firm views in favour of a federal model for Buganda that would be at odds with the British emphasis on a unitary state."]}]}}
