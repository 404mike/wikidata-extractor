She was the wireless operator for the Wheelwright network led by George Starr in southwestern France from August 1943 until the liberation of France from Nazi German occupation in September 1944. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.\nCormeau was acclaimed for the quality and quantity of her wireless transmissions. SOE cryptographer Leo Marks said that in more than 400 transmissions Cormeau never made a single mistake. Cormeau also survived an unusually long time for wireless operators who were vulnerable to detection and capture by the German occupiers.  She was a recipient of the Order of the British Empire from the United Kingdom and the Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre from France.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yolande Beekman", "response": ["When World War II broke out, Beekman joined the WAAF where she trained as a W/T operator.

She trained with Noor Inayat Khan and Yvonne Cormeau."]}, {"page": "George Reginald Starr", "response": ["Starr was described by his wireless operator, Yvonne Cormeau, as short in stature, five feet six inches in height, very nervous, a heavy cigarette smoker, and a man who took duty and responsibility seriously and would never ask a person to do anything he would not do himself. Cormeau was his closest associate, \"confidante and, a few alleged, his lover.\"Glass, Charles (2018), They Fought Alone, New York: Penguin Press, p. 8, 103.", "These initial successes aside, in spring 1943, seemingly forgotten by SOE headquarters in London, Starr was suffering from a skin disease probably caused by stress and contemplating failure and the abandonment of his mission. He sent Denise Bloch, an SOE agent on the run from another part of France, to Spain and hence to England with a written report (violating his own rule against written communication) requesting money and a wireless operator of his own. London's immediate answer was to send an aeroplane to hover over Castelnau to communicate with Starr by short-range S-Phone to determine that he was still alive. Starr affirmed his existence by greeting the pilot with a string of expletives and finally got attention from London. It was soon \"raining containers\" full of arms and equipment for the maquis.Glass, pp. 72\u201379 Starr's SOE team would expand to include explosives expert Claude Arnault, wireless operator Yvonne Cormeau, and courier Anne-Marie Walters.", "On 21 August, Toulouse fell to the French Forces of the Interior, the umbrella organisation of resistance fighters.  Starr and Yvonne Cormeau drove into the city, American and British flags on their car. The liberation of southwestern France was complete. However, the leader of the Armagnac Battalion, Maurice Parisot, was killed on 6 September; while an American aeroplane was landing, a propeller broke away from the motor and struck him.Glass, pp. 219\u2013228", "The withdrawal of the Germans from southwestern France left the area in political chaos in which \"feudal barons,\" of whom Starr was among the most important, took control. On 16 September 1944, General Charles de Gaulle, head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, visited Toulouse.  De Gaulle had little respect for the Resistance which had varying philosophies among its different groups of how France should be governed post-war. On meeting Starr and other resistance leaders, De Gaulle denounced them as mercenaries. He ordered Starr to leave France. Starr replied that he was in France under the authority of the allies and he did not recognise De Gaulle as his superior officer. De Gaulle threatened to arrest him but Starr stood his ground, and the meeting ended with a handshake. Nine days later, on 25 September, Starr and his wireless operator, Yvonne Cormeau, made a hasty departure from France.Foot, pp. 419\u2013420"]}, {"page": "Women's Auxiliary Air Force", "response": ["* Flight Officer Yvonne Cormeau, awarded the MBE, the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, Croix de Guerre and M\u00e9daille combattant volontaire de la R\u00e9sistance."]}, {"page": "Fairy (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Fairy, codename of Special Operations Executive Agent Yvonne Cormeau (1909-1997)"]}, {"page": "List of SOE agents", "response": ["| Yvonne Cormeau||  F, Wheelwright ||  British  || 1909\u20131997 || CdeG, DM, GS, MBE, LdH, War Medal 1939-1945, ST || Joined Women's Auxiliary Air Force.
