He made the odd appearance from October 1962 and 1964, after which point he started to appear rather more frequently. He was not a favourite with Stanley Matthews or trainer Lol Hamlett as he had a habit of talking back to the pair, so he put in a transfer request in 1966. In all competitions he made 32 appearances, scoring 6 goals, being utilised mostly as an inside-forward."]}, {"page": "Hamlett", "response": ["*Lol Hamlett (1917\u20131986), English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["The club started 1949\u201350 with 86 players, though only 27 of these were full-time professionals.

The season saw another mid-table finish, though most of the talk was on the subject of the up-and-coming stadium in Burslem. A massive \u00a320,000 was raised for the sale of Ronnie Allen to West Brom.

Wolverhampton Wanderers' Andy Poole proved to be an inadequate replacement. Vale then lost Greenhoff to Rochdale, who offered him the vacant management post. Lol Hamlett's last match as trainer (he retired due to illness) was a 2\u20130 defeat to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, as Vale were in danger of failing to win promotion. McGrath decided to sign striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, and loaned Mark Lawrence from Hartlepool United. Siddall returned and so did Vale's form, as they recorded five victories in seven games. Ernie Moss left for Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee, McGrath saying 'age caught up with him'. Wimbledon ran away with the championship, though Vale managed to secure promotion with a 2\u20130 win over Stockport County at Edgeley Park on 6 May.
