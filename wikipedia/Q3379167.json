Brockway acknowledged his wife, Lila Brockway, had the foresight 'that those who intended to refuse military service should band themselves together'. Lila acted as provisional secretary at their cottage in Derbyshire until the beginning of 1915, when the membership had grown so large that it had become necessary to open an office in London. In London, Catherine Marshall became the Fellowship's political secretary since she was adept at political strategy as the Parliamentary Secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. The No-Conscription Fellowship produced a weekly newspaper The Tribunal that was suppressed; through the activity of Joan Beauchamp it continued production although her refusal to divulge the name of the printer caused her to be charged with contempt of court and held in custody for 10 days. The offices of the Labour Leader were raided in August 1915 and Brockway was charged with publishing seditious material. He pleaded not guilty and was acquitted in court. In 1916 Brockway was again arrested, this time for distributing anti-conscription leaflets. He was fined, and after refusing to pay the fine, was sent to Pentonville Prison for two months."]}, {"page": "Beauchamp", "response": ["* Joan Beauchamp, prominent suffragette and co-founder of the Communist Party of Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Midsomer Norton", "response": ["* Joan Beauchamp (1890\u20131964), suffragette and co-founder of the Communist Party of Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Suffragette", "response": ["* Joan Beauchamp"]}, {"page": "Kay Beauchamp", "response": ["She was born to a farming family at Welton Manor Farm, Midsomer Norton, Somerset on 27 May 1899.
