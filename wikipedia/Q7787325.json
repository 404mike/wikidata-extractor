Exhibiting publicly with the Birmingham Society of Artists from 1827 onwards, he painted landscapes throughout Warwickshire, the Midlands and the Welsh border regions and occasionally producing depictions of the Lake District, Scotland and Ireland. More often than not Baker's landscapes include cattle, although sheep and human figures are also fairly common in his works.\nBaker kept comprehensive records of his work and usually signed each major picture \"T Baker\", dated it to the year and numbered it on the back. Smaller pieces, studies and pencil sketches tend to be signed \"T.B.\" (sometimes to be found playfully hidden around gravestones, fenceposts, treeroots etc.) and dated more precisely. His diaries and notes \u2013 which contain an 800-strong list of his major works - are held in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery while the art gallery at the Royal Pump Rooms in Leamington Spa has a collection of over sixty Baker landscapes, a couple of which are nearly always on display in the Art Gallery. The art historian Alison Plumridge and local historian Charles Lines have both highlighted how Baker provided artistic tutoring to the local middle classes in order to supplement his earnings from major local patrons such as Lord Leigh. In terms of wider success, Baker exhibited four oil paintings at the Royal Academy between 1831 and 1858 with his work appearing more frequently at the British Institution (where he exhibited 19 paintings) and the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. \n\nAfter his premature death in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, at the age of 55 (amid suggestions of murder that led to the suicide of his housekeeper, Hannah Hewitt), Baker's body was returned to his birthplace and buried in close proximity to the famous Midlands landscape artist David Cox at St. Peter's Church in Harborne, Birmingham.\nThe Birmingham-based photographer and landscape painter Edmund Smith-Baker (usually given as E. S. Baker) was the eldest of Baker's five illegitimate children by Elizabeth Alice Smith, a lodging housekeeper from Cubbington. Edmund Smith-Baker ran a studio on Bristol Street in Birmingham together with his younger brother Thomas William, where \u2013 alongside the production of carte de visite photographs \u2013 he is believed to have completed new and previously unfinished Baker landscapes. Some of these works are signed \"E.S. Baker\" while others display a rather more decorative signature of \"E.S.B\" in which the \"S\" is combined with an enlarged \"B\".\nAs a last point of interest with regard to Thomas Baker 'of Leamington', Charles Lines has suggested that, prior to his relationship with Elizabeth Alice Smith, the artist had previously been married at either Leamington All-Saints or Lillington Church and produced two legitimate sons. However, there is no evidence to support this. This assumption is likely based on the two Smith-Baker sons going by the last name of Baker such as E.S. Baker by Edmund Smith-Baker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Thomas Baker (1809\u20131864)"]}, {"page": "1809 in art", "response": ["*October 9 \u2013 Thomas Baker \"of Leamington\", English landscape painter (died 1864)"]}, {"page": "Harborne", "response": ["* Thomas Baker (artist)"]}, {"page": "1864 in art", "response": ["* August 10 \u2013 Thomas Baker \"of Leamington\", English landscape painter (born 1809)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Baker", "response": ["*Thomas Baker (Peasants' Revolt leader) (died 1381), English landowner and a leader of the 1381 Peasants' Revolt", "*Thomas Cheseman or Thomas Baker ( 1488\u20131536 or later), Member of Parliament for Rye", "*Thomas Baker (died 1625), Member of Parliament for Arundel", "*Colonel Thomas Baker (1810\u20131872), founder of Bakersfield, California", "*Thomas Baker (cricketer) (born 1981), English cricketer who played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "*Thomas Baker (Royal Navy officer) (1771\u20131845), Royal Navy admiral", "* Thomas Baker (Medal of Honor recipient) (1916\u20131944), World War II Medal of Honor recipient", "*Thomas Baker (Peasants' Revolt leader) (died 1381), English landowner", "* Thomas Baker (aviator) (1897\u20131918), Australian soldier and aviator of the First World War", "* Thomas Baker (general) (born 1935), United States Air Force general", "*Thomas Baker (missionary) (1832\u20131867), English Christian missionary cannibalised in Fiji", "*Sir Thomas Baker (Unitarian) (1810\u20131886), English Unitarian minister and Mayor of Manchester", "* Thomas Baker (college president) (1871\u20131939), president of Carnegie Mellon University", "* Thomas Baker (entomologist), American professor at Penn State University", "*Thomas Baker (antiquarian) (1656\u20131740), English antiquarian", "*Thomas Baker (artist) (1809\u20131864), English landscape painter and watercolourist", "*Thomas Baker (musician), composer and producer of musical stage productions", "*Thomas Baker (mathematician) (1625?\u20131689), English mathematician", "*Thomas Baker (dramatist) (c. 1680\u20131749), English dramatist and lawyer"]}, {"page": "St Peter's Church, Harborne", "response": ["* Watercolour artist Thomas Baker is buried next to David Cox."]}, {"page": "Frederick Whitehead", "response": ["Whitehead was born in Leamington Spa in 1853, the eldest child of William and Hannah Whitehead.
