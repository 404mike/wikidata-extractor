He was a government whip from 1997 until 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Brown", "response": ["In mid-2008, Brown's leadership was presented with a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign.  This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of holding on to the Labour Party leadership.  Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest.  However, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis.  In the autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, an MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position.  While she did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour Party to hold a leadership election. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterward, on 12 September. She was supported in making clear her desire for a contest by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government. In the face of this speculation over Brown's future, his ministers backed him to lead the party, and Harriet Harman and David Miliband denied that they were preparing leadership bids. After Labour lost the Glasgow East by-election in July, Harman, the deputy leader of the party, said that Brown was the \"solution\", not the \"problem\"; Home Secretary Smith, Justice Secretary Jack Straw, Schools Secretary Ed Balls and Cabinet Office Minister Ed Miliband all re-affirmed their support for Brown. The deputy Prime Minister under Blair, John Prescott, also pledged his support. Foreign Secretary David Miliband then denied that he was plotting a leadership bid, when on 30 July, an article written by him in The Guardian was interpreted by a large number in the media as an attempt to undermine Brown. In the article, Miliband outlined the party's future, but neglected to mention the Prime Minister. Miliband, responded to this by saying that he was confident Brown could lead Labour to victory in the next general election, and that his article was an attack against the fatalism in the party since the loss of Glasgow-East. Miliband continued to show his support for Brown in the face of the challenge that emerged in September, as did Business Secretary John Hutton, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn, and Chief Whip Geoff Hoon."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Greg Pope", "| Greg Pope"]}, {"page": "1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Greg Pope"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Greg Pope"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Greg Pope"]}, {"page": "Pope Gregory", "response": ["* Greg Pope (b. 1960), British Labour Party politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Hyndburn || Greg Pope || Labour || Greg Pope || Labour"]}, {"page": "Hyndburn (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Greg Pope"]}, {"page": "Ken Hargreaves", "response": ["Joseph Kenneth Hargreaves, MBE, KSG (1 March 1939 \u2013 23 June 2012) was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Hyndburn, Lancashire between 1983 and 1992, when he lost his seat to Greg Pope of Labour.
