Eddington was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his Quaker religious beliefs, one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist. He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and Astronomer Royal Frank Watson Dyson organized two expeditions to observe a solar eclipse in 1919 to make the first empirical test of Einstein's theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field. In fact, Dyson's argument for the indispensability of Eddington's expertise in this test was what prevented Eddington from eventually having to enter military service."]}, {"page": "International Astronomical Union", "response": ["* (1928\u20131932)  Frank Watson Dyson"]}, {"page": "May 25", "response": ["*1939 \u2013 Frank Watson Dyson, English astronomer and academic (b. 1868)"]}, {"page": "Parsec", "response": ["Though it may have been used before, the term parsec was first mentioned in an astronomical publication in 1913.

The observations were performed in 1919 by Arthur Eddington, Frank Watson Dyson, and their collaborators during the total solar eclipse on May 29. The solar eclipse allowed the stars near the Sun to be observed. Observations were made simultaneously in the cities of Sobral, Cear\u00e1, Brazil and in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe on the west coast of Africa. The observations demonstrated that the light from stars passing close to the Sun was slightly bent, so that stars appeared slightly out of position."]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| Frank Watson Dyson || UK || 1868 || 1939", "*Frank Watson Dyson (UK, 1868\u20131939)"]}, {"page": "Mill Hill", "response": ["University of London Observatory is a teaching astronomical observatory which is part of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London.
