He previously worked as Professor in the Metamakers Institute at Falmouth University, UK and led the Computational Creativity Research Groups at Goldsmiths, University of London and at Imperial College, London in the positions of Professor and Reader, respectively. He graduated from the University of Durham with a degree in Mathematics, gained an MSc. in Pure Mathematics at the University of Liverpool, and finally a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professor Alan Bundy.\nSimon is the driving force behind thepaintingfool.com, an artificial intelligence that he hopes will one day be accepted as an artist in its own right. His work, along with that of Maja Pantic and Michel Valstar, won the British Computing Society Machine Intelligence Award in 2007. The work has also been the subject of some media attention.Prior to his work on The Painting Fool, Simon worked on the HR tool, a reasoning tool that was applied to discover mathematical concepts. The system successfully discovered theorems and conjectures, some of which were novel enough to become published works. Colton's work with HM included the discovery of refactorable numbers, which appeared to be original but turned out to have been previously discovered.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of computer scientists", "response": ["* Simon Colton \u2013 computational creativity"]}, {"page": "Kevin Warwick", "response": ["Warwick presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in December 2000, entitled Rise of the Robots.

Sci. 13, 383-386, 1990  where they showed that the tau numbers have natural density zero, they were later rediscovered by Simon Colton using a computer program he had made which invents and judges definitions from a variety of areas of mathematics such as number theory and graph theory.S. Colton, \"Refactorable Numbers - A Machine Invention,\" Journal of Integer Sequences, Vol. 2 (1999), Article 99.1.2 Colton called such numbers \"refactorable\". While computer programs had discovered proofs before, this discovery was one of the first times that a computer program had discovered a new or previously obscure idea. Colton proved many results about refactorable numbers, showing that there were infinitely many and proving a variety of congruence restrictions on their distribution. Colton was only later alerted that Kennedy and Cooper had previously investigated the topic."]}, {"page": "Computational creativity", "response": ["The Painting Fool, developed by Simon Colton originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as AARON does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter."]}, {"page": "HR (software)", "response": ["HR is a computer program that automatically forms mathematical theories by searching for sequences of numbers.

HRL generates software \"student\" agents, which are given information with which they attempt to make inferences.

The teacher arranges group discussion amongst the students and may request further modification of conjectures."]}, {"page": "Colton (surname)", "response": ["* Simon Colton, English computer scientist"]}, {"page": "The Painting Fool", "response": ["#REDIRECT Simon Colton"]}]}}
