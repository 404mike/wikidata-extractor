Scott began his career as an apprentice at the G Plan factory, before going on to study furniture design at the Royal College of Art in 1963. In 1969 Scott was engaged as a designer for the  modern furniture manufacturer Hille. The company was keen to develop its range by commissioning designers to work with new plastics, following its success with Robin Day's polypropylene chair. Scott's designs exploited the possibilities of moulding offered by polyurethane, and he rapidly made his mark with innovative and distinctive designs such as the Elephant chair and the Athena chair, and in 1974 Hille launched his folding chair.Scott also worked on a new design for a wheelchair for disabled people, and this work inspired him to design an ergonomic aluminium office chair, the Supporto office chair, in 1976. Despite the commercial risk involved in its manufacture, Hille took a risk and brought the Supporto to market in 1979. It became an internationally successful product, and the chair was soon complemented by other seating and tables in the Supporto range. Supporto is still in production today, manufactured by Zoeftig Limited.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick Scott", "response": ["*Frederick Scott (field hockey) (born 1933), British Olympic hockey player", "*Frederick Scott (designer) (1942\u20132001), British designer best known for creating the Supporto chair"]}, {"page": "Rosamind Julius", "response": ["Robin Day designed a novel chair name Hillestak which used laminated wood and the stackable chairs became popular for public buildings. The partnership with Robin Day was very successful and in 1952 the Hille company set up showrooms in Mayfair where their modernist furniture could be displayed. Here they could host architects and interior designers. They won important contracts to supply prestige offices in London and the contract for the furniture for what would become Heathrow Airport. These chairs are still there (2014). By 1953 they had five showrooms in Britain and another in Grenoble. In 1958 they designed the furniture for Gatwick Airport. Rosalind and her husband's company continued to support British design and in 1963 Day designed another important chair this time in Polypropylene. This polypropylene chair would become the world's most commercially successful chair. Fred Scott designed the Supporto seating system in 1976 and it was launched in 1979.Frederick Scott , Supporto.co.uk, Retrieved 12 October 2015 Meanwhile, they won contracts for British embassies, the Istanbul Hilton and the Unesco building in Paris. Their successful British designs were licensed overseas including the rights to manufacture tens of thousands of chairs for the Mexico Olympics.Richard Snell, 'Julius , Rosamind (1923\u20132010)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2014 accessed 24 Sept 2015 "]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2001", "response": ["*Frederick Scott, 58, British designer."]}]}}
