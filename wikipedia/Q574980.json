A member of the Conservative Party, Rees-Mogg is a social conservative.\nRees-Mogg was born in Hammersmith, London, and educated at Eton College. He then studied History at Trinity College, Oxford, and was President of the Oxford University Conservative Association. He worked in the City of London and in Hong Kong for Lloyd George Management until 2007, then co-founded a hedge fund management business Somerset Capital Management LLP. He amassed a significant fortune: it was estimated at between \u00a355 million and \u00a3150 million in 2016, including his wife's expected inheritance. Moving into politics, he unsuccessfully contested the 1997 and 2001 general elections before being elected as the MP for North East Somerset in 2010. He was re-elected in 2015 and 2017, with an increased share of the vote each time, and in 2019, with a smaller share of the vote. Within the Conservative Party, he joined the traditionalist and socially conservative Cornerstone Group.\nDuring the premiership of David Cameron, Rees-Mogg was one of the parliamentary Conservative Party's most rebellious members, opposing the Whip's office on a number of issues. He became known for his speeches and filibustering in parliamentary debates. A Eurosceptic, he proposed an electoral pact between the Conservatives and the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and campaigned for the Leave side in the 2016 referendum on membership of the European Union. He joined the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG), becoming chairman in 2018. He attracted support through the social media campaign Moggmentum and was promoted as a potential successor to Prime Minister Theresa May as Leader of the Conservative Party. He however endorsed Boris Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest. Johnson appointed him Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council following his election as Conservative Leader and appointment as Prime Minister.\nRees-Mogg has been praised as a conviction politician whose anachronistic upper-class mannerisms and consciously traditionalist attitudes are often seen as entertaining. Critics view him as a reactionary figure; the traditionalist attitudes have been characterised as obscuring controversial political views, some of which have made him the target of organised protests. He has been dubbed the \"Honourable Member for the 18th century\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Beano", "response": ["As well as expanding Beano franchise through games and merchandise, Beano.com also contains other activities and interests for children to enjoy, such as news about popular celebrities, and miscellaneous videos and articles.

Dennis and Gnasher's constant targeting of passive, diligent Walter \"the Softy\" (who was also a knitting and flower-picking hobbyist) was accused of encouraging playground homophobia, so it was toned down. Walter was also rewritten to be a bit less soft, becoming more antagonistic and stood up to Dennis sometimes, eventually having his first girlfriend. Fatty from the Bash Street Kids was renamed Freddy (his real name) in 2021, causing backlash from former readers, including Jacob Rees-Mogg who accused the change of being \"publicity-seeking\".

William Hague and Michael Howard campaigned on traditionalist grounds in the 2001 and 2005 general elections respectively, and 2001 also saw the election of traditionalist Iain Duncan Smith as party leader. In the current parliament, modernising forces are represented by MPs such as Neil O'Brien, who has argued that the party needs to renew its policies and image, and is said to be inspired by Macron's centrist politics. Ruth Davidson is also seen as a reforming figure, as is the Minister for Women and Equalities and Minister for Levelling up Communities, Kemi Badenoch. Many of the original 'traditionalists' remain influential, though Duncan Smith\u2019s influence in terms of Commons contributions has waned. Many 'traditionalist' backbenchers such as Christopher Chope, Peter Bone and Jacob Rees-Mogg command significant media attention for their use of fillibustering and frequent interjections, and so remain influential forces in the Commons, though they cannot be taken to represent all 'traditionalist' Conservatives.", "Most oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24\u2011week abortion limit.
