Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 While at Burnage, he developed a love of poetry which was to last all his life, but the fondness for classical music which took him fairly often to concerts by The Hall\u00e9 orchestra was not to last to a similar extent. His ambitions at that time were either to become a writer or to play cricket for Lancashire County Cricket Club.Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, 17 September 1977", "Before doing this, however, Croft had started a process which was to change not only his own life, but those of thousands of others affected by it. As David Weston, one of those most influenced by Croft, put it: \"Michael, who had taken part in open-air productions in the college gardens at Oxford, hit upon the idea of an epic modern dress production of Julius Caesar on the school playing fields, using the School's Cadet Force.\" Croft had found the existing dramatic society rather \"dreary\", and occupied mainly by boys who were already interested in acting. What he wanted was to use the play to get those who would not normally be interested in such things to take part and to enjoy doing so. The Cadet Force, the football and cricket teams, and the \"bad boys\" were the ones he targeted. He estimated that eventually about half of the school was involved in the production itself in some wayDesert Island Discs, 1977 and, as a fellow-teacher said of him, \"Michael could get the most extraordinary response and performances out of the most unlikely boys.\"Weston, 2008", "As David Weston put it, Croft \"enjoyed an increasingly expansive lifestyle, which he shared generously with his vast circle of friends and acquaintances. He had a great appetite for life, food and drink. He has been described as a Falstaff with a thousand Prince Hals. It is tragic that a man who could inspire such devotion and friendship should die alone on a Saturday night in 1986.\"Weston, 2008 An instruction in his will nevertheless provided a party for hundreds of his friends, \"at which the food shall be wholesome and the drink shall not be allowed to run out\".Sykes, 2004 In a similar vein, the luxury item which he had selected for his Desert Island had been a whisky still.Desert Island Discs, 1977", "*David Weston, 'Who Was Who in Dulwich: Michael Croft, Founder of the National Youth Theatre', The Dulwich Society Newsletter, 7 August 2008 (http://www.dulwichsociety.com/newsletters/42-summer-2006/228-michael-croft accessed 26 December 2012.)"]}, {"page": "David Weston", "response": ["David Weston may refer to:", "* David Weston (artist) (1935\u20132011), British industrial artist and author", "* David Weston (actor) (born 1938), English actor, director and author", "* David Weston (cricketer) (1930\u20131977), New Zealand cricketer"]}, {"page": "Ovington's Bank", "response": ["The novel was adapted for BBC television in 1965 as Heiress of Garth in six episodes of 25 minutes.
