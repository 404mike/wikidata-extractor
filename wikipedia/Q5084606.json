He joined Southampton in January 1922 and made his debut at home to Merthyr Town on 8 April as a centre-forward in place of the injured Bill Rawlings. He made a solitary appearance the following season before converting to the right-wing position. He started the 1923\u201324 season on the wing in place of Charlie Brown and scored twice in his third match at home to Bury on 1 September 1923. He was just beginning to establish himself and was looking capable of emulating his father's career when his career was interrupted by a broken leg sustained in a match against Bristol City on 6 October. The injury kept him out for a year but, before he could get back into the first team, he broke the same leg again. Although he fully recovered from his injuries, he was never the same player again and after one final come-back match (against Chelsea on 5 April 1926) he moved to Gillingham."]}, {"page": "Robert Blyth (footballer)", "response": ["He made eight appearances for Portsmouth in the 1921\u201322 season before joining Southampton in January 1922.

At the time Southampton were leading the Third Division South table and their fans were confident of gaining promotion. Manager Jimmy McIntyre shocked them by announcing a four player transfer, with wingers Fred Foxall and Barratt moving to Birmingham in exchange for Jack Elkes (a forward) and George Getgood (a half-back).
