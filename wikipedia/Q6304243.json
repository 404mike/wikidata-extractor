The storyline, backed by the NSPCC, aimed to destroy some unhelpful stereotypes about what most expect a paedophile to be like.

Although he wasn't guilty, Patricia refused to believe him and left him, taking Alice and Thomas to live in France. Her mother joined them soon after. Following a quick divorce from Patricia later that year, Max remarried his first wife, Susannah, and following the death of their two children, Emily and Matthew in an April 1997 car crash where Susannah was driving, they became involved in a lengthy surrogacy storyline with Jacqui Dixon (Alexandra Fletcher) after Susannah discovered she could no longer have children as a result of an infection caused by injuries sustained in the crash.20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White.

His character's exit was unpopular and involved a retconned storyline where Max had supposedly had a 20-year-long affair with a woman called Faye, never before mentioned in the script. This was considered a lazy way to write out the long-serving character, and Max abruptly departed, so Susannah returned to her maiden name and, now a single mother of two babies, continued to live alone at number 7.20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White.
