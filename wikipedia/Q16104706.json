Stringer had worked as consulting curator for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, travelling exhibition Two Decades of American Painting, which opened at the NGV in 1967. As the first large-scale survey of contemporary American art, including abstraction by Josef Albers, Ad Reinhardt and Mark Rothko, it was an important influence on 1960s Australian art. Critic James Gleeson however, denied that the artists in The Field were exercising 'conscious imitation of specifically American attitudes, but that while Two Decades of American Painting provided an additional stimulus, 'the revolution in Australia had already begun.' It was a 'clear and unequivocal announcement that a large number of Australian painters had accepted the notion that art should be non-expressive and uncommunicative,' promoted 'long before\u2026by galleries like Central Street and Gallery A' [and Pinacotheca, then in St. Kilda, which concurrently with the NGV show advertised 'for viewing' 15 of The Field artists in its stockroom alongside a solo by Rollin Schlicht].the artists being Peter Booth, G. S. Christmann, Dale Hickey, Robert Hunter, Michael Johnson, Alun Leach-Jones, Tony McGillick, Alan Oldfield, Wendy Paramor, Robert Rooney, Rollin Schlicht, Eric Shirley, Dick Watkins, John White, and Normana White.
