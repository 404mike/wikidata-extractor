He was one of six children born to William and Anne Ross Cousin, his mother being a noted hymn-writer, in Scotland. A fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries and secretary of the Actuarial Society of Edinburgh, he revised and wrote the introduction for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Evangeline in 1907.\nHowever, he is best known as the editor of A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature, a collection of biographical entries on numerous authors and literary figures, originally published in 1910 for J.M. Dent's \"Everyman Library\" series. The bulk of his work was later used by David Clayton Browning to compile the Everyman's Dictionary of Literary Biography which was released in 1958 and subsequently reprinted during the 1960s and 1970s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Distributed Proofreaders", "response": ["| A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature, John William Cousin"]}, {"page": "William Harrison Ainsworth", "response": ["His Lancashire novels cover altogether 400 years and include The Lancashire Witches, 1848, Mervyn Clitheroe, 1857, and The Leaguer of Lathom. Jack Sheppard, Guy Fawkes, 1841, Old St Paul's, 1841, Windsor Castle, 1843, and The Lancashire Witches are regarded as his most successful novels. He was very popular in his lifetime and his novels sold in large numbers, but his reputation has not lasted well.Drabble, M. (ed.) The Oxford Companion to English Literature; 5th ed.

Viking, New York.  1986  (pp. 2\u20133) As John William Cousin argues, he depends for his effects on striking situations and powerful descriptions, but has little humour or power of delineating character. S.T. Joshi has characterized his output as an \"appalling array of dreary and unreadable historical novels\".S.T. Joshi, Unutterable Horror: A History of Supernatural Fiction Volume 1. NY: Hippocampus Press, 2014, p. 195 E. F. Bleiler has praised Windsor Castle as \"the most enjoyable\" of Ainsworth's novels. Bleiler also stated \"All in all, Ainsworth was not a great writer--his contemporaries included men and women who did things better--but he was a clean stylist and his work can be entertaining\"."]}]}}
