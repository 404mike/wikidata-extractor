He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in what became known as the Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in the law on compulsory purchase. In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for murder in the United Kingdom. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George. Two years later, Stevenson took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of John Bodkin Adams for the murder of Edith Alice Morrell.\nStevenson became a High Court judge in 1957, and acquired a reputation for severity in sentencing. He sentenced the Kray twins to life imprisonment in 1969, with a recommendation that they serve not less than 30 years each. In 1970 Stevenson passed long sentences on eight Cambridge University students who took part in the Garden House riot, and the following year gave Jake Prescott of the Angry Brigade 15 years for conspiracy to cause explosions.\nOne of his fellow judges, Sir Robin Dunn, described him as \"the worst judge since the war\". After Dunn's attack, several high-profile legal figures came to Stevenson's defence, among them fellow judge and biographer Lord Roskill, who pointed out that Stevenson could be merciful to those he regarded as victims. Lord Devlin described Stevenson as the \"last of the grand eccentrics\". Stevenson retired from the bench in 1979 aged 76, and died at St Leonards in East Sussex on 26 December 1987.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Angry Brigade", "response": ["Jake Prescott, whose origins were in the mining community of Dunfermline, was arrested and tried in 1971.

The other members of the group from North-East London, the \"Stoke Newington Eight\", were prosecuted for carrying out bombings as the Angry Brigade in one of the longest criminal trials of English history (it lasted from 30 May to 6 December 1972). As a result of the trial, John Barker, Jim Greenfield, Hilary Creek and Anna Mendelssohn received prison sentences of 10 years.

Devlin considered that the prosecution, although it had not been wrong to bring the case to trial, had not prepared its case adequately as the Attorney-General was a busy minister and the next most senior member of his team Melford Stevenson did not make up for his leader's absence.Devlin, (1985), pp. 121, 178. The prosecution had not presented a coherent case, particularly on motive, and in his summing up Devlin said that the defence case was a manifestly strong one.Devlin, (1985), pp. 167, 177. In contrast, the defence led by Geoffrey Lawrence Q.C. had, in his view, presented a meticulously prepared and ably argued case.Devlin, (1985), p. 161. Devlin directed the jury not to find for the prosecution unless they rejected all the defence arguments, and accepted this was a summing up for an acquittal. Adams was then found not guilty on the Morrell charge.

He had made the explicit claim that Adam's instructions to specially clear Mrs Hullett's cheque two days before her death showed that he knew she would be die very soon; as Mrs Morrell was wealthy and Adams had ample cash in his bank accounts, there was no other reason for his wanting special clearing.Robins, p.168. However, Devlin questioned how this could transform a case that seemed obviously to be suicide into one of murder.Devlin, pp. 31-2 Stevenson also made reference to the deaths of Mrs Hullett and her husband as evidence of critical similarities to the death of Mrs Morrell. Devlin considered the police case that there were similarities in deaths of Mrs Morrell and Mrs Hullett was not well founded, as the claimed similarities were not sufficiently distinctive.

Dr Douthwaite had been a member of the prosecution team since December 1957 when, together with the pathologist Dr Francis Camps, he had assured the Attorney General, Melford Stevenson and the Director of Public Prosecutions that the amounts of opiates prescribed for Mrs Morrell would have been fatal beyond doubt had they been injected, and he also gave evidence to this effect in the Committal hearing.Robins, pp.225\u20136. Devlin commented that, having assured the prosecution of the soundness of his opinion, Douthwaite was determined to stand by it in the trial of Dr Adams.Devlin, pp. 108\u20139.", "After a later review of the completed case file by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Hannam and Hewett met the Director, the Attorney General, Melford Stevenson, the pathologist Dr Francis Camps and Dr Douthwaite on 18 December 1956. After Drs Camps and Douthwaite had assured the Attorney General and the two other lawyers present that the amounts of opiates prescribed for Mrs Morrell were fatal beyond doubt, Manningham-Buller instructed the police to arrest Adams.Robins, pp. 150\u20131, 158. Dr Douthwaite apparently accepted Hannam's theory, as he stated in evidence-in-chief, that morphia and heroine would have turned Mrs Morrell into an addict and given Adams complete ascendancy over her, and any anger she had shown was a withdrawal symptom, not a sign of independence. Under cross examination he was confronted with evidence that two doctors besides Adams who had seen Mrs Morrell had also prescribed opiates, whereas Dr Douthwaite had never examined her.Robins, pp. 227\u20138, 232.", "An alternative, and more valid, criticism of the prosecution than Hewett's is that it prepared and presented its case badly. Its case relied heavily on police evidence and the testimony of expert witnesses, neither of which had been thoroughly tested in the pretrial period.Devlin, pp. 76\u20137, 121\u20132 This caused the prosecution embarrassment when the nurses' notebooks were produced, over the destruction of the case based on prescriptionsDevlin, pp. 62, 79. and when Dr Douthwaite's change of opinion while in the witness box.

Manningham-Buller complained in a parliamentary debate soon after the verdict that Devlin had wrongly rejected his submission that Adams' admission that he had used virtually all the prescriptions supplied should have been accepted, believing that the acquittal was due to judicial misdirection.Devlin, pp. 174, 181, 187. Melford Stevenson was reported by Hallworth to have criticised the right to silence in the 1980s as having enabled Adams to escape punishment, saying \"I firmly believe justice is not served by the present law. It should be possible for the prosecution to directly examine an accused....\"Hallworth and Williams, pp. 232\u20133.

Her narrative account of the trial includes a verbatim record of the important speeches and verbal exchanges. She treats the trial process as fallible,Bedford, p. 103. and although accepting the correctness of the verdict, expresses disappointment that Adams' silence left a gap in the narrative of the trial.Bedford, pp. 162\u20133. This regret that Adams did not speak is echoed in Devlin's more legalistic comment that a \"not guilty\" verdict does not usually mean the accused has established their innocence, but that there is doubt about guilt. Adams had been accused of three murders, indicted on two counts and had a trial and been found not guilty of one of these, but by widely publicised innuendo, he had been implicated in many more. The only way that Adams could have challenged these suspicions would have been to give evidence to explain his actions, and to accept being cross-examined.Devlin, pp. 144, 197."]}, {"page": "Heinz-Wilhelm Eck", "response": ["In prison, Lenz provided his captors with a signed confession.
