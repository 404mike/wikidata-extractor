While schooling at Charterhouse he played cricket for three years, captaining the senior team, in 1855. Fred Lillywhite remarked of him that \"His thorough knowledge of the game enabled him to fill most ably the office of captain. His batting throughout the season was excellent. His style is good, and he possesses great freedom in hitting all round. His bowling throughout the season was well up to the mark. Perhaps a little more steadiness in his batting would improve his scores.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Henry Armitstead (1864) : S.
