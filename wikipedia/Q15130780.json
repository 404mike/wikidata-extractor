In his work on Venda music, he writes, \"The problem of musical description is not unlike that in linguistic analysis: a particular grammar should account for the processes by which all existing and all possible sentences in the language are generated.\"Blacking, John. 1971. \"Deep and Surface Structures in Venda Music.\" Yearbook of the International Folk Music Council 3: 91-108. Blacking sought more than sonic description. He wanted to create a musical analytical grammar, which he coined the Cultural Analysis of Music, that could incorporate both sonic description and how cultural and social factors influence structures within music. Blacking desired a unified method of musical analysis that \"...can not only be applied to all music, but can explain both the form, the social and emotional content, and the effects of music, as systems of relationships between an infinite number of variables.\" Like Nattiez, Blacking saw a universal grammar as a necessary for giving ethnomusicology a distinct identity. He felt that ethnomusicology was just a \"meeting ground\" for anthropology of music and the study of music in different cultures, and lacked a distinguishing characteristic in scholarship. He urged others in the field to become more aware and inclusive of the non-musical processes that occur in the making of music, as well as the cultural foundation for certain properties of the music in any given culture, in the vein of Alan Merriam's work."]}, {"page": "List of musicologists", "response": ["*John Blacking"]}, {"page": "Kochari", "response": ["John Blacking describes Kochari as follows:"]}, {"page": "Level (music)", "response": ["A level,van der Merwe, Peter (1989).
