He was the creator and leader of the Tinker network (or circuit) which operated in the area of Troyes, France. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.\nCowburn was sent into occupied France on four different missions during World War II. He was the longest serving F-Section (French Section) SOE agent. He was never captured by the Germans. Of the more than 400 SOE agents who worked in France during World War II, M. R. D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, named Cowburn as one of SOE's half-dozen \"best men.\" Cowburn was a prudent and practical agent, much concerned with the security of the French people with whom he worked.", "link_mentions": {}}}
