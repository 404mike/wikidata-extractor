He was the creator and leader of the Tinker network (or circuit) which operated in the area of Troyes, France. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.\nCowburn was sent into occupied France on four different missions during World War II. He was the longest serving F-Section (French Section) SOE agent. He was never captured by the Germans. Of the more than 400 SOE agents who worked in France during World War II, M. R. D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, named Cowburn as one of SOE's half-dozen \"best men.\" Cowburn was a prudent and practical agent, much concerned with the security of the French people with whom he worked.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "SOE F Section timeline", "response": ["::SOE agents Benjamin Cowburn, Michael Trotobas, Victor Gerson, George Langelaan, Jean du Puy, and Andr\u00e9 Bloch parachuted into France at night near Ch\u00e2teauroux. They were met by B\u00e9gu\u00e9, Max Hymans, and a local farmer, Octave Chanteraine. Cowburn, Trotobas, and Gerson would become important SOE agents.", "::The destruction of the Prosper network began with the arrest by the German SD of sisters Germaine and Madeleine Tambour in Paris. Both had been associated with Carte and also with Prosper. Francis Suttill attempted unsuccessfully to bribe the Germans for their release. Both were later executed.  The sisters' apartment was a safe house and a letter box to pass along messages for SOE agents. A few days before the arrest, Benjamin Cowburn had commented to Suttill that too many people were going in and out of the apartment.

In a letter she said that if SOE would send her a piece of soap she would be \"both very happy and much cleaner.\"  In the absence of an SOE wireless operator her access to the American diplomatic pouch was the only means the few agents left at large in France had of communicating with London.  She continued building contacts in southern France and she assisted in the brief missions of SOE agents Peter Churchill and Benjamin Cowburn and earned high compliments from both. She avoided contact with an SOE agent sent to Lyon named Georges Duboudin and refused to introduce him to her contacts.  She regarded him as amateurish and lax in security.  When SOE headquarters directed that Duboudin should supervise her, she told SOE to \"lay off.\"  She worked as little as possible with Philippe de Vom\u00e9court, who, although an authentic French Resistance leader, was lax in security and grandiose in his ambitions.Purnell, pp. 69\u201389, 99\u2013100. In August 1942, SOE agent Richard Heslop met with her and described her as a \"girl\" (she was 36) who lived in a gloomy apartment, but he relied on her to facilitate communications with other agents. When a suspicious Heslop demanded to know who \"Cuthbert\" was she showed him by banging her wooden foot against a table leg producing a hollow sound.

Cowburn described Suttill as having a \"dynamic personality\" and  said that \"the small world of the resistance rallied to a strong personality.\"  He also saw problems with security and remarked that a large number of SOE agents and their French contacts were going in and out of the same apartment.  Suttill responded that SOE headquarters kept sending people to him who needed help and that the address of the apartment had been passed around by agents. Cowburn, Benjamin (2014), No Cloak, No Dagger, Barnsley, Yorkshire: Frontline Books, pages 148-149 The size and scope of Prosper violated SOE doctrine that agents in different networks should have no contact with each other and even that agents in the same network should rarely meet, but rather communicate through intermediaries or letter-drops. Suttill, however, was running a large organization in which contacts among SOE agents were extensive. Security was loose. Norman, Borrel, and Agazarian and his wife, Francine, met frequently to play poker at a Paris cafe. The remnants of the Carte network which were folded into Prosper included at least one German agent.  Moreover, the German Gestapo and Abwehr were becoming more expert at rooting out SOE agents and their French collaborators. The consequence would be the capture of Suttill and many of his agents and the destruction of the Prosper network.Suttill and Foot, Foot, p. 104."]}, {"page": "Yvonne Fontaine", "response": ["Fontaine's work with the resistance began in April 1943 when an experienced SOE agent, Benjamin Cowburn, and his radio operator Denis John Barrett came to Troyes to set up a sabotage network, which SOE named Tinker. Cowburn came into contact with Pierre Mulsant and through him met Fontaine who he hired as a courier for a salary of 2,000 francs (about 10 British pounds) per month. Given the code name Nenette, she was adept at the job, carrying messages and sabotage material over a large area in northeastern France. The Tinker network had some successes, including on the night of 3/4 July the destruction of six locomotives used by the Germans. Fontaine also helped eighteen American airmen, shot down near Troyes, escape to Switzerland. However, the Germans infiltrated and destroyed many of the SOE networks in France during the summer of 1943. Cowburn was evacuated from France in September 1943 and on 15 November, the remaining members of the Tinker team, Fontaine, Mulsant, and Barrett, departed France for England from a clandestine airfield.  Among the other resistance workers evacuated on the same airplane was a future president of France, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand.O'Connor, (2018), pp. 273-275Escott, pp. 162-163", "Disaster struck in July 1944.  A British commando team of the SAS called Operation Gain radioed they were in trouble in the nearby Forest of Fontainebleau. Mulsant and Barrett and others rushed to rescue the SAS team but were captured by the Germans. Benjamin Cowburn returned to France on July 30 in an unsuccessful attempt to free Mulsant and Barrett but both were later executed. Fontaine, the sole survivor of the Minister network, continued work with the Resistance until the liberation of the area from German control in late August 1944.
