He was instrumental in founding the original London Film Society in 1925, but left soon afterwards to work in America. He found success on Broadway, as Mr. Jingle in Pickwick in 1927; and in Hollywood, in the Gloria Swanson film The Love of Sunya, that same year. Miller was cast as dialogue coach for Lawrence of Arabia (1962), and was mentor to actor Peter O'Toole from early in his career, and recommended Miller to Lean. Miller, who was one of several members of a David Lean film crew to be given bit parts, was hired again as dialogue coach in Doctor Zhivago (1965), his last screen effort before his death in 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lawrence of Arabia (film)", "response": ["* Hugh Miller as the RAMC colonel.

It counted among its sponsors George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and numerous members of the Bloomsbury group. It was simply called the Film Society, but is often referred to as the London Film Society as it was followed by many others in the next fifteen years. These included the Edinburgh Film Guild (1929, still in existence) and the Salford Workers Film Society (1930; this became the Manchester & Salford Film Society, still in existence),.
