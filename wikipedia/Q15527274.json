The son of a London cab driver, Bindon was frequently in trouble as a youth for getting into fights, and spent two periods in borstal. He was spotted in a London pub by Ken Loach, who asked him to star in his film Poor Cow (1967).\nOther film and television productions followed, with Bindon sought after to play gangsters or tough police detectives. He played a violent mobster alongside Mick Jagger in Performance (1970) and a London crime boss in Get Carter (1971). Philip Hoare described Bindon as \"the archetypal actor-villain, and an all-round 'good geezer'\".He was also known for having many socialite girlfriends, such as Christine Keeler, the former Playboy \"Bunny Girl\" Serena Williams, and Vicki Hodge, who had a 12-year abusive relationship with Bindon, which ended in 1981. Through Hodge, the daughter of a baronet, Bindon gained access to British aristocratic circles, which culminated with his meeting Princess Margaret in the late 1960s, at her home on Mustique in the Caribbean.Bindon lived his hard man persona on and off screen. He was believed to be running protection rackets in west London pubs and was alleged to have connections to the Kray twins and the Richardson Gang. In the late 1970s, in addition to acting work, he provided security for actors and musicians, most notoriously for Led Zeppelin on their 1977 US tour, where he was sacked for brawling backstage. \nIn 1978, Bindon was tried for the murder of London gangster Johnny Darke. Bindon pleaded self-defence and was acquitted, but the case damaged his reputation, and that, coupled with being seen by directors as difficult to work with, meant his acting career declined. In the 1980s, Bindon became reclusive; he died in 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon", "response": ["Reportedly, Margaret had her first extramarital affair in 1966, with her daughter's godfather Anthony Barton, a Bordeaux wine producer.Heald, p. 170; Warwick, p. 245 A year later she had a one-month liaison with Robin Douglas-Home, a nephew of former British Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home.Heald, p. 170 Margaret claimed that her relationship with Douglas-Home was platonic, but her letters to him (which were later sold) were intimate.Warwick, pp. 245\u2013246 Douglas-Home, who suffered from depression, died by suicide 18 months after the split with Margaret.
