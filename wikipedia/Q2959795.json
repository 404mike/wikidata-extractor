DeWolfe, age 1, is found on the 1860 United States Federal Census \u2013 July 12, 1950), also known as Lady Mendl after her marriage in 1926, was an American actress who became a very prominent interior designer and author. Born in New York City, de Wolfe was acutely sensitive to her surroundings from her earliest years and became one of the first female interior decorators, replacing dark and ornate Victorian decor with lighter, simpler styles and uncluttered room layouts. Her marriage to English diplomat Sir Charles Mendl was seen as a marriage of convenience, although she was proud to be called Lady Mendl. Her lifelong companion was Elisabeth Marbury, with whom she lived in New York and Paris. De Wolfe was a prominent social figure, and she entertained in the most distinguished circles.", "De Wolfe's first career choice was that of actress. She originally appeared with the Amateur Comedy Club in New York City as Lady Clara Seymour in A Cup of Tea (April 1886) and as Maude Ashley in Sunshine (December 1886), a one-act comedy by Fred W. Broughton.  Her success led to a full-time theatrical career, making her professional debut in Sardou's Thermidor in 1891, in which she played the role of Fabienne with Forbes-Robertson.New International Encyclopedia In 1894 she joined the Empire Stock Company under Charles Frohman.  In 1901 she brought out The Way of the World under her own management at the Victoria Theatre, and later toured the United States in the role.
