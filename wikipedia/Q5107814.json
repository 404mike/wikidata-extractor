He was returned to the Senate at the 1984 election. In the 1990 election, the Call to Australia party made the unusual choice of preferencing the Labor Party above the Liberal Party specifically to prevent Puplick's re-election; Puplick was not re-elected and his term finished in June 1990.After leaving Parliament, Puplick was appointed President of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board and NSW Privacy Commissioner. He was appointed a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia in 2001, for contributions to Australian politics and public policy, particularly in relation to human rights and social justice.Puplick resigned his Anti-Discrimination Board and Privacy Commission positions in 2003 following allegations of administrative favouritism involving a personal friend, and a deteriorating relationship with the New South Wales Government.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "National Institute of Dramatic Art", "response": ["In 2012, former NIDA board member and Liberal senator Chris Puplick, who had served on the board for three years, wrote an essay titled \"Changing Times at NIDA\" which was published in the October issue of the publication Platform Papers. In the essay, Puplick criticized the teaching standards of the school and its director and chief executive, Lynne Williams, stating that she has had no significant experience in theatre to head the school and that her style was \"Thatcherite\". Soon after Puplick's statements were reported, chairman of NIDA's board, Malcolm Long, and Lynne Williams replied back to the comments, with Long stating that Williams had the complete support of the board and described Puplick as \"an apparently disaffected former board member.\" Williams had defended herself stating her management style was not \"Thatcherite\". Long also mentioned that amongst Williams' supporters were Cate Blanchett and Ralph Myers. Supporting Puplick were actor, director and a graduate of the school Jeremy Sims, who had launched the essay, and Kevin Jackson, who had taught acting at the school for 27 years."]}, {"page": "1987 in Australia", "response": ["*31 January \u2013 A rally in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, of new ultra-right Grassroots 2000 represents a declaration of war by Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the religious right on the \"wets\" and \"losers\" in the Liberal Party of Australia such as Ian McPhee, Peter Baume, Chris Puplick, Robert Hill, Steele Hall and Max Burr.
