A damn turnip in perspective!\" Florian Philippot, another member of the FN declared: \"According to the trailer that I saw [...], it looks like a nice turnip, but, beyond the quality of the film, I find it really scandalous that in the countryside Presidential election, I believe precisely two months before the vote, one leaves in the French rooms a film that is clearly anti-National Front. [...] It disturbs me on behalf of Catherine Jacob. I was a fan of Catherine Jacob. There, I love her very much, but for me she is spoiled. Why? For some money, for a C\u00e9sar Award, for a little chocolate medal that will be given, for service rendered to the system?\". Jacob answered: The stupid reaction of the National Front is a gift.
