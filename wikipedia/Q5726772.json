He was involved in several of the group's collective projects, most notably the decoration of the chapel at Madresfield Court, which numbers among the seminal achievements of the Arts and Crafts movement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arts and Crafts movement", "response": ["Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain were critical of the government system of art education based on design in the abstract with little teaching of practical craft. This lack of craft training also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should pay more attention to the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed.Charles Harvey and Jon Press, \"William Morris and the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction\", Journal of the William Morris Society  11.1, August 1994, pp. 31-34  The first school to make this change was the Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts, which \"led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper). In his external examiner's report of 1889, Walter Crane praised Birmingham School of Art in that it 'considered design in relationship to materials and usage.'\"\"Birmingham Institute of Art and Design\" fineart.ac.uk Under the direction of Edward Taylor, its headmaster from 1877 to 1903, and with the help of Henry Payne and Joseph Southall, the Birmingham School became a leading Arts-and-Crafts centre."]}, {"page": "Stained glass", "response": ["Among the most innovative English designers were the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris (1834\u20131898) and Edward Burne-Jones (1833\u20131898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.Peter Cormack, Arts & Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015 The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts & Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke."]}, {"page": "Henry Payne", "response": ["Henry Payne may refer to:", "*Henry Payne (artist) (1868\u20131940), English Arts and Crafts artist", "*Henry Payne (cartoonist) (born 1962), editorial cartoonist for The Detroit News and United Media", "*Henry Payne (engineer) (1871\u20131945), Australian engineer and academic", "*Henry Payne (MP), member of parliament for Wallingford"]}, {"page": "Madresfield Court", "response": ["The chapel was decorated in the Arts and Crafts style by Birmingham Group artists including Henry Payne, William Bidlake and Charles March Gere.

Murals on the chapel's walls incorporate images of the couple, as well as their seven children, in scenes rife with Christian symbolism.
