It was still a very small town in 1689 when it was described by the Jacobite army officer and future author John Stevens as \"a miserable poor place, hardly worth the name of a town\", consisting of \"seven or eight small houses, and some mean little cottages\".  Wolfe Tone Square in the town commemorates Theobald Wolfe Tone, a leader during the 1798 rebellion. In the lead up to the rebellion, Dublin-born Tone led the republican United Irishmen in what he had hoped would be a local re-run of the recent French Revolution; this was to be achieved with the help of French Republicans in overthrowing British rule. The ill-fated French invasion fleet, known as the French expedition to Ireland, arrived in the area in 1796, but its purpose was frustrated by unfavourable winds. For his efforts in preparing the local defences against the French, Richard White, a local landowner, was created Baron Bantry in 1797 by a grateful British administration. A Viscountcy followed in 1800 and in 1816 he became the 1st Earl of Bantry. The mansion and gardens in the Bantry House demesne on the outskirts of the town testify to the family's status."]}, {"page": "Williamite War in Ireland", "response": ["Ireland was a relatively poor country with a small population, obliging both armies to depend on external support. While this ultimately proved a greater problem for the Jacobites, Schomberg's men lacked tents, coal, food and clothing, largely because his inexperienced commissary agent in Chester could not charter enough ships. This was worsened by choosing a campsite on low, marshy ground, which autumn rains and lack of hygiene quickly turned into a stinking swamp. Nearly 6,000 men died from disease before Schomberg ordered a withdrawal into winter quarters in November. Inspecting the abandoned camp, John Stevens, an English Catholic serving with the Grand Prior's Regiment, recorded that \"a vast number of dead bodies was found there unburied, and not a few yet breathing but almost devoured with lice and other vermin\"."]}, {"page": "Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda", "response": ["#Captain John Stevens (1705)"]}, {"page": "Worksop Priory", "response": ["Worksop Priory Antient Abbeys.jpg|Engraving form John Stevens' The History of the Antient Abbeys, 1723"]}, {"page": "C\u00e9sar Oudin", "response": ["His dictionary Tesoro de las dos lenguas francesa y espa\u00f1ola (1607) is based on literary texts and was later used by John Minsheu, Lorenzo Franciosini, John Stevens and other lexicographers; Girolamo Vittori expanded this dictionary with trilingual Tesoro from 1609, later plagiarized by Oudin in his Tr\u00e9sor of 1616.
