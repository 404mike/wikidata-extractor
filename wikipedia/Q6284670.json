He joined the show in 2002 and was axed in early 2005 after his character was criticised for being too stereotypical. Joseph was brought back in September and was involved in his first big storyline when his character got involved in a romance with a much younger girl (Ruby Allen) but since the end of the storyline he rarely was involved in any other storylines and therefore became a background character. Almost a year after returning, Kpobie had left the show again after a mutual decision was made with the producers that his character had reached a natural end.\nHe also had a regular role in the drama series Grange Hill playing school bully Mick Daniels from 1992 to 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sylvia Young Theatre School", "response": ["*Joseph Kpobie"]}, {"page": "Johnny Allen (EastEnders)", "response": ["The character's story arc began with Johnny usurping fellow mob boss Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) from his position as the square's reigning crime kingpin, which ultimately leads Andy to try and swindle \u00a3750,000 from Johnny in his requested \"job\"; however, this fails after Johnny intercepts his plan \u2014 thanks to Andy's bodyguard Eddie (Daren Elliott Holmes) \u2014 and he ends up killing Andy by throwing him off a motorway bridge during the show's 20th anniversary episode. Soon afterwards, Johnny proceeded to force the local Ferreira family out of Walford before going on to establish an unlikely friendship with his old acquaintance Pat Harris (Pam St Clement); exile his errand boy Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) from the square in retribution for Danny burning down his house; become enemies with Phil and Grant's mother, Peggy (Barbara Windsor), after she turns his daughter Ruby (Louisa Lytton) against him; destroy his own relationship with former mistress Tina Stewart (Charlotte Avery); hire Peggy's nephew Billy (Perry Fenwick) to become Danny's replacement until he later fires him for conspiring with his family; develop a conflict with Ruby's best-friend, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), over the way how their rebellious friendship strains his daughter's education; blackmail Danny's brother Jake (Joel Beckett) with the discovery that his girlfriend Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) murdered her estranged husband Den (Leslie Grantham) and framed Peggy's daughter Sam (Kim Medcalf) for the crime; constantly torment Ruby's boyfriend Juley Smith (Joseph Kpobie) upon learning that he is the reason she lost her virginity to him; and arrange for popular hardman Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) to be fatally stabbed on New Year's Eve 2005 after being attacked by the latter in retaliation for threatening his adoptive sister-turned-recent wife Sharon (Letitia Dean).", "In December, Johnny continues to clash with Phil, and later makes an enemy with his love rival Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) \u2014 who is Den's illegitimate son and married to his adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean).

On Christmas Day, Johnny insults the residents during a party \u2014 causing Dennis to throw him out and taunt Johnny on the street. Outraged that Dennis has humiliated him, Johnny responds by attempting to have Sharon leave Walford with Dennis by midnight on New Year's Eve. When Sharon refuses to oblige to his demands, Johnny throttles her and threatens to have Dennis killed if she does not relent. To make his threat even more clear, Johnny indirectly tells Sharon that he killed Andy. This causes Sharon to fabricate an idea to Dennis about them leaving Walford on New Year's Eve, to start anew. While Dennis is happy with the idea, Phil notices how uncomfortable Sharon appears to be when encountering Johnny, and urges her to talk to him about it. She confides to Phil about the threat Johnny made against her and Dennis, from the other night. This enrages Phil, who plans to team up with Dennis against Johnny. However, Sharon objects to this and tells Phil that Johnny killed Andy in a bid to explain just how dangerous he is \u2014 pleading with him to let her and Dennis leave Walford. Phil reluctantly agrees, until he encounters Dennis on the night of New Year's Eve, whereupon he attempts to get Dennis to take revenge on Johnny by revealing that he killed Andy. Although this surprises Dennis, since he was the only friend Andy had made prior to Johnny's arrival on the square, he refuses to be tempted at first \u2014 telling Phil that his life has changed ever since he killed his gangland boss and Andy's predecessor Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett) a few years previously. However, Dennis eventually relents when Phil tells him that Johnny has throttled Sharon as well. Later on, Dennis confronts Johnny at his nightclub about what he did to Andy and Sharon \u2014 thus disrupting Johnny's habit of watching the New Year fireworks. Johnny offers to get Dennis a drink and claims that Phil is lying to him about what happened to both Andy and Sharon. But as Johnny does so, Dennis attacks him and leaves him unconscious, moments before the New Year fireworks are due to be seen over the Square. Just as it appears that Dennis and Sharon will reunite amid the celebrations, he is fatally stabbed by a hooded passer-by and dies in Sharon's arms \u2014 much to her anguish. At Dennis' funeral, Sharon lashes out at Johnny when he appears to offer his condolences. She later informs Phil that Johnny killed Dennis, and a guilt-ridden Phil swears revenge on Johnny more than ever.
