An attacking batsman, he had a long career with Yorkshire and played eleven Tests for England. His nickname of 'Lucky' came from his habit of surviving the numerous chances that his attacking batting style created for the opposition. He was a fine deep fielder, and was said to be an excellent judge of a high catch, but did little bowling: his only really significant contribution with the ball came in 1896, when he took 5\u201342 against South of England. He also had one first-class stumping to his name, against Cambridge University in 1905.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1905 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 David Denton, Walter Lees, George Thompson, Joe Vine, Levi Wright"]}, {"page": "1912 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 David Denton 2127 @ 42.54 (HS 221)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  David Denton"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Hawke succeeded Emmett in 1883 and remained as official captain for 27 years, but at first he was careful to take his time and did not make too many changes. Yorkshire improved in 1883 and finished second behind Nottinghamshire in the unofficial County Championship. However, the remainder of the 1880s was disappointing for the team and its supporters. Kilburn said that Yorkshire \"continued to be an unreliable side, mingling brilliant achievement with miserable performance\". The basic problem was that the older players were past their peak while younger replacements did not make the progress expected. A poor season on the field in 1889 was reflected by reduced income and changes were made with several good new players being introduced. These included Jack Brown, David Hunter and Stanley Jackson, while Bobby Peel was becoming increasingly effective as a bowling all-rounder. They were followed by John Tunnicliffe, David Denton, Ted Wainwright and George Hirst. Hawke worked on fielding practice and the players became specialised and efficient as fielders.", "* David Denton"]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["Swanton wrote that, by 1900, Hawke had \"moulded Yorkshire into the finest side in the country\" and they won the County Championship three years in succession from 1900 to 1902. They were \"essentially a complete team\" with the batting of Tunnicliffe, Brown and David Denton; the powerful all-round play of Hirst, Rhodes and Schofield Haigh; and, crucially given Test calls, \"plentiful reserves of high quality\".Swanton, p. 24. According to Kilburn, Hawke came to the \"fulfilment of his cricketing ambitions\" with the three successive titles which were \"a logical culmination to ten years of cultivation\".Kilburn, p. 26. Hawke's own batting was variable during these three seasons. He had little success in 1900 but scored 902 runs and 7 half-centuries in 1901; and then 565 runs with 2 centuries and no half-centuries in 1902. His 1902 centuries were 107 not out for MCC against Oxford University and 126 for Yorkshire against Surrey."]}, {"page": "Wilfred Rhodes", "response": ["In the 1909\u201310 English winter, MCC toured South Africa with a team below full Test strength. Rhodes opened the batting throughout the tour, partnering Jack Hobbs for the first time.Rogerson, pp. 92\u201393. However, Wisden stated that only Hobbs would have been sure of his batting place in a full strength England team, and that both Rhodes and David Denton, the next best batsmen, were a long way behind Hobbs. In all first-class matches, Rhodes scored 499 runs at an average of 26.26, with three fifties, and took 21 wickets at 25.47. In the Test series, which South Africa won 3\u20132, Rhodes took only two wickets in the five games. As a batsman, however, he  shared some large partnerships with Hobbs. England lost the first two Tests, although in the first Rhodes and Hobbs put on 159 for the first wicket, of which Rhodes made 66. In the second Test the pair put on 94 in the first innings and 48 in the second, Rhodes made little impact on the third and fourth Tests; in the final Test, an England victory, he and Hobbs scored 221 together, Rhodes making what was then his highest Test score of 77.  Wisden stated that while overshadowed by the brilliance of Hobbs, Rhodes in this innings batted without mistakes.  In the five Tests Rhodes scored 226 runs,  averaging 25.11. During the tour Rhodes and Hobbs developed mutual trust while batting together, to the point where they could score runs without having to call to each other. This degree of understanding was unusual at the time.Rogerson, pp. 93\u20134. After the Test series ended, several amateur members of the team wanted to extend the tour into Rhodesia, but the professionals refused to take part as their contracts did not cover this and they would have effectively played for no wages. Rhodes, although not the ring-leader, was influential in this strike, and a sports newspaper, Winning Post, singled him out as responsible in an article highly critical of him and the other professionals.Rogerson, pp. 94\u20136."]}, {"page": "Lucky Denton", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Denton (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Johnny Tyldesley", "response": ["Tyldesley was an outstanding fielder who specialised in deep positions, mostly at third man or deep long on, and was noted for his speed and ability to quickly gather and accurately return the ball.
