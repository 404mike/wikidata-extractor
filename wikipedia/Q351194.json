Some media reported that the bill was expected to be promulgated on 5 July, but it was delayed due a legal challenge lodged with the Privy Council. However, the Cabinet Office stated that the bill would receive royal assent in the Privy Council, and be officially proclaimed during the Tynwald sitting on 19 July. The Chief Minister said that the UK European Union membership referendum was the reason for the delay, and that the law would take effect on 22 July. The law indeed received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Adam Wood in the Privy Council on 13 July and was proclaimed on 19 July. It took effect three days later. The first same-sex marriage to be registered on the Isle of Man was that of Marc and Alan Steffan-Cowell, who converted their civil partnership into a marriage on 25 July 2016. The first same-sex marriage ceremony on the island occurred on 30 July between Luke Carine and Zak Tomlinson."]}, {"page": "Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man", "response": ["|||Adam Wood||"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2011", "response": ["***#Adam Wood, Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man (2011\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of wedding guests of Prince William and Catherine Middleton", "response": ["*  Adam Wood (Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2012", "response": ["***Lieutenant-Governor\u00a0\u2013 Adam Wood, Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man (2011\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Kenya", "response": ["*2005\u20132008: Adam Wood"]}, {"page": "List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Uganda", "response": ["*2002\u20132005: Adam Wood"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2013", "response": ["***Lieutenant-Governor\u00a0\u2013 Adam Wood, Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man (2011\u20132016)"]}]}}
