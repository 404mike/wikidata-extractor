He played his first gig when he was fourteen in a band called Retrospect with Richard Entwistle, John Allman and Martin Pike and other musicians, and by the time he was sixteen he was performing regularly. Beer worked with Paul Downes as a duo from 1974 and also in the Arizona Smoke Revue 1980. He was a key member of Johnny Coppin's band (ex-Decameron), and together they collaborated with Nigel Mazlyn Jones on his 1979 Sentinel album. He toured with Mike Oldfield in 1979 and also recorded some tracks at Oldfield's Througham studio.  Beer joined The Albion Band in 1984 and stayed with them until 1991, touring extensively at home and abroad, and recording many albums. Show of Hands became a full-time partnership from 1991. Beer continues to do session work, most notably on The Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels album, Steve Harley's Poetic Justice and countless other mainstream and less high-profile projects.

It was featured in Mary Barton published in 1848, then later referred to the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1862. It is found on broadsides in Manchester up to the 1880s, it did not survive into the 20th century. In the folk revival it reappeared. The version by Ewan MacColl probably influenced the version by Silly Sisters and by Unto Ashes. Jez Lowe wrote his song \"Nearer to Nettles\", after an old woman approached his band's vocalist, who'd just sung The \"Four-Loom Weaver\", remarking she'd never been nearer to eating nettles at that time (late 80s/early 90s) than during any other period of her life."]}, {"page": "Jack Common", "response": ["The folk singer/songwriter Jez Lowe has an album entitled Jack Common's Anthem, containing a song of the same name."]}, {"page": "Middlewich Folk and Boat Festival", "response": ["*Jez Lowe and the Bad Pennies", "*Jez Lowe and The Bad Pennies"]}, {"page": "County Palatine of Durham", "response": ["As with neighbouring Northumberland, County Durham has a rich heritage of Northumbrian music, dating back from the Northumbrian Golden Age of the 7th and 8th centuries.
