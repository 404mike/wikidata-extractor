In 1919 the sisters decided to run away to London. Kathleen was employed by Harrods, helping with the horses that pulled the delivery carriages, and also worked as an artist's model. Mary drove a delivery van. Shocked by their behaviour, their father eventually decided to support them. They rented a studio apartment at 13 Regent Square, Camden, and enrolled in a private art school. At night they frequented West End clubs such as The Gargoyle, The Harlequin, and The Cave of the Golden Calf. It was at the Harlequin that Kathleen met the 40-year-old Epstein, who invited her to his table and asked her to pose for him. Mary ended up marrying the South African poet Roy Campbell. Kathleen, Mary, and Lorna were all to become bohemian members of what became known as the Bloomsbury Group. In 1936 Kathleen was photographed by Gordon Anthony."]}, {"page": "E. O. Hopp\u00e9", "response": ["Working from a studio first in London's Baron's Court at 10 Margravine Gardens (1907\u201310), he later moved in 1911 to a Baker Street studio. In 1913 he took on a lease of 7 Cromwell Place, occupying all thirty-three rooms of the previous home of Sir John Everett Millais, which later (from 1937) was used by dance photographer Gordon Anthony and subsequently Francis Bacon. Hopp\u00e9 also made portraits of the street types of London: he photographed English cleaners, maids, and street vendors both in his studio and on the street. He continued this practice of capturing ordinary working men and women throughout his career as he traveled throughout the world."]}, {"page": "Gordon Anthony (photographer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gordon Anthony"]}]}}
