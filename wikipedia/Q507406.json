This development occurred independently in several global locations from as early as 9000\u20137000BC in Mesopotamia to 3500\u20133000BC in the Americas. People first domesticated the most important dairy animals\u00a0\u2013 cattle, sheep and goats\u00a0\u2013 in Southwest Asia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since.  Initially animals were kept for meat, and archaeologist Andrew Sherratt has suggested that dairying, along with the exploitation of domestic animals for hair and labor, began much later in a separate secondary products revolution in the fourth millennium BC. Sherratt's model is not supported by recent findings, based on the analysis of lipid residue in prehistoric pottery, that shows that dairying was practiced in the early phases of agriculture in Southwest Asia, by at least the seventh millennium BC."]}, {"page": "V.
