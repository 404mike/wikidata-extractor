Both Kelly and Calvin mention the criticism by British author Ian McDonald, and his fundamental objection, that much good science fiction is being written without any awareness of or need for the manifesto. Niall Harrison argued that Interzone #216's collection of MSF stories does not develop \"a convincing case for mundane sf.\" Also in 2008, Chris Cokinos described The Mundane Manifesto as anthropocentric. He noted that the concern in MSF about wasting the abundance of Earth is influenced by the \"...moral climate that permeates North American and British nature writing\", adding that MSF is intended \"more as compass than chimera\"."]}, {"page": "Kyla Ward", "response": ["*\"Reading the Game \u2013 Depictions of Role-Playing in Popular Culture\" (2013) in Strange Horizons No. 28 (ed.
