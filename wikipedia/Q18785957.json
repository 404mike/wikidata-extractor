He became a member of Team GB's taekwondo squad on his major debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics, retrieved two bronze medals in the 78-kg division at the European Championships (2005 and 2006), and held a total of eight national championship titles throughout his entire career in the United Kingdom. Missing out on selection for two succeeding Olympic bids, Brown had decided to leave his British team to apply for his dual citizenship and represent Jamaica in 2013. Shortly after his immediate transfer, Brown trained full-time with Jamaican national coach Fabio Takahashi, and gave his new team a historic silver medal in taekwondo at the 2014 Central American and Caribbean Games in Veracruz, Mexico.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Craig Brown"]}, {"page": "Craig Brown", "response": ["Craig Brown may refer to:", "* Craig Brown (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u20131963), Scottish footballer", "* Craig Brown (footballer, born 1940), Scottish footballer and manager", "* Craig Brown (mayor) (\u20132020), New Zealand local-body politician", "* Craig Brown (cricketer) (born 1954), Australian cricketer", "* Craig Brown (satirist) (born 1957), British critic and satirist", "* Craig Brown (canoeist) (born 1971), British slalom canoer", "* Craig Brown (footballer, born 1971), Scottish footballer", "* Craig Brown (curler) (born 1975), American curler", "* Craig Brown (taekwondo) (born 1983), English-Jamaican taekwondo practitioner"]}]}}
