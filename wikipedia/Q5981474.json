He is known for using innovative and experimental film techniques, and for being Pink Floyd's original animator.Emes' animations have featured in major exhibitions, including Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains at the V&A (2017) and the National Film Theatre Retrospective (1980).  His works have also been used in live music tours, such as Roger Waters Us + Them (2017), David Gilmour Live at the Royal Albert Hall (2016) and Mike Oldfield's In Concert Tour (1980).  He is the winner of three BAFTA Awards (1994, 2009, 2011), a Palme d'Or (1979), a British Animation Award (2014), and is an Emmy Award (2017) and Oscar Academy Award (1984) nominee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film", "response": ["| Ian Emes"]}, {"page": "Music video", "response": ["In this period, directors and the acts they worked with began to discover and expand the form and style of the genre, using more sophisticated effects in their videos, mixing film and video, and adding a storyline or plot to the music video. Occasionally videos were made in a non-representational form, in which the musical artist was not shown. Because music videos are mainly intended to promote the artist, such videos are comparatively rare; three early 1980s examples are Bruce Springsteen's \"Atlantic City\", directed by Arnold Levine, David Mallet's video for David Bowie and Queen's \"Under Pressure\", and Ian Emes' video for Duran Duran's \"The Chauffeur\". One notable later example of the non-representational style is Bill Konersman's innovative 1987 video for Prince's \"Sign o' the Times\" \u2013 influenced by Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" clip, it featured only the text of the song's lyrics."]}, {"page": "Handsworth, West Midlands", "response": ["* Ian Emes, animator and film director"]}, {"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Ian Emes \u2013 Animator"]}, {"page": "Duran Duran (1983 video)", "response": ["===\"The Chauffeur\" (Ian Emes)===", "This video is the only one on the album in which the band do not appear at all.

The video is a fantasy of two mysterious, hauntingly beautiful women who are seen ritualistically dressing themselves in elaborate lingerie before travelling separately through the dark streets and tunnels of London to meet in a vacant underground car park for an exotic lesbian encounter. The song's dramatic instrumental finale was accompanied by a topless Perri Lister as the female chauffeur performing a sensuous dance \u2013 clearly an homage to Charlotte Rampling's topless, fetishistic \"Dance of the Seven Veils\" in Liliana Cavani's famous 1974 film The Night Porter."]}, {"page": "Time (Pink Floyd song)", "response": ["During live performances, the band back-projected a specially-commissioned, animated film by Ian Emes.
