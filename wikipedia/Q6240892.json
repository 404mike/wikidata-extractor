He was born at Powick Court, Worcestershire.\nEducated at Harrow School, Isaac's first-class debut came for the South Africa Army cricket team in the only match of that standard they ever played, when they met Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Thara Tswane, Pretoria in January 1906. The MCC side were far too strong for their opponents and won by an innings, Isaac making 0 and 8. This match was chiefly notable for Schofield Haigh's feat of taking four wickets in as many balls in the Army's second innings.In 1906\u201307 he played four times for Orange Free State in the Currie Cup, though his highest score was only 34 not out. Curiously, in Isaac's eight visits to the crease he was four times out bowled to a man who would take six or more wickets in that innings (JJ Kotze 8-57, RO Schwarz 7-25, AEE Vogler 6-34 & 8-24).\nIn 1907 and 1908, Isaac made five appearances for Worcestershire County Cricket Club, but never made more than 13 and never played first-class cricket again.\nAttached to the 2nd battalion, Rifle Brigade, Captain Isaac was killed in action in World War I, at Fromelles, France at the age of 35 during the northern attack of the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915. Initially posted as missing, his body was recovered in April 1921 and identified by the medal ribbons.  He was subsequently reburied at New Irish Farm Cemetery, Ypres, West, Belgium.\nIsaac's brother Arthur and nephew Herbert also played first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*John Isaac (1880\u20131915), English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "Herbert Isaac", "response": ["His father, Arthur Isaac, had a more substantial career with Worcestershire, while his uncle John Isaac also played first-class cricket."]}, {"page": "Isaac (name)", "response": ["* John Isaac (cricketer), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|John Isaac"]}, {"page": "List of Worcestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Isaac (1902\u20131908) : J.
