He spent three years at Anfield without making a first-team appearance. He then spent two seasons with American United Soccer League side Sacramento Republic, before returning to England to join Leek Town in September 2017. He was signed by Port Vale in January 2019 and loaned back to Leek Town. He joined Curzon Ashton on loan in September 2019, to FC United of Manchester in February 2020 and again to Leek Town in October 2020. He featured in just three cup games during his two-and-a-half seasons at Vale Park before rejoining Leek Town in July 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liverpool F.C.

After taking time to consider his position he said that he would remain as manager as he had the support of the players and the chairman. On 12 January, Vale fell to a 3\u20130 home defeat to Colchester, losing Pope to a hamstring injury in the process and Aspin bemoaned his side's poor run of luck. Two days later he signed versatile defender Adam Crookes on loan from Nottingham Forest, who had previously been recalled from a loan at Lincoln City after failing to break into the first-team there. Another new arrival was 23-year-old striker Danny Elliott, who was signed following a trial; he had previously been playing in the Spanish Tercera Divisi\u00f3n for San Cristoba. With Pope ruled out of action for over a month with a hamstring injury, Miller was restored to the starting eleven at Crawley on 19 January and scored the only goal of the game to maintain the club's five-point gap above the relegation zone. Aspin went on to bring in 20-year-old Wales youth international forward Mark Harris on loan from Cardiff City. However he was again facing questions over his own future following a 1\u20130 home defeat to promotion-chasing Carlisle United; Vale had actually looked good for a point until conceding a deflected goal on 79 minutes despite having Miller sent off for a reckless challenge just before half-time. They closed out the month with a 0\u20130 draw at Newport County, though ended a third consecutive game with only ten men as Gibbons was given a straight red card with five minutes left to play. Aspin tendered his resignation the following day, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we [he and assistant Lee Nogan] did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch\". Despite having no manager, the club completed the loan signing of West Bromwich Albion defender Kyle Howkins, who had joined the club on loan at the same point of the 2017\u201318 season. Three more young midfield players were also signed, Callum Whelan and Toby Edser on loan from Manchester United and Nottingham Forest respectively, and Daniel Trickett-Smith from Leek Town \u2013 who was immediately returned on loan to Leek.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||||align=\"left\"| Daniel Trickett-Smith", "| 31 January 2019 || AM ||  || Daniel Trickett-Smith || Leek Town || Undisclosed || ", "| 31 January 2019 || AM ||  || Daniel Trickett-Smith || Leek Town || 31 May 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||25||align=\"left\"| Daniel Trickett-Smith", "| 13 September 2019 || AM ||  || Daniel Trickett-Smith || Curzon Ashton || 14 November 2019 ||", "| 21 February 2020 || AM ||  || Daniel Trickett-Smith || FC United of Manchester || 17 March 2020 || "]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale's nine-game unbeaten came to an end with a 1\u20130 defeat at already-relegated Grimsby Town after Matt Green capitalised on an under-hit back-pass from Joyce; Monta\u00f1o was sent off late in the game after receiving a second yellow card for dissent.

He also transfer-listed Theo Robinson, Danny Whitehead and Scott Burgess. Clarke's first signing as manager was Brad Walker, a defensive ball playing central midfielder who had been released from League One club Shrewsbury Town. He then paid Blackpool an undisclosed fee for central midfielder Ben Garrity, who he described as \"young, hungry and ambitious\". Biddulph-born James Wilson was then signed upon his release from Salford City, a 25-year old striker who had come through Manchester United as a highly rated teenager. The club also confirmed that Andy Crosby would be staying on at the club as assistant manager, which director of football David Flitcroft said was \"a really important signing\" due to his \"outstanding coaching, organisational skills, knowledge, work ethic and enthusiasm\". Aaron Martin, a 31-year old centre-back who had previously worked with Crosby at Southampton, then joined on a two-year deal. Another former Salford City player, left-back Dan Jones, then joined on a two-year deal. Taking Brown's place in goal was 30-year old Brazilian Lucas Covolan, who had been on the losing side of the National League play-off final despite scoring a stoppage-time equaliser for Torquay United. Aidan Stone, a 21-year old goalkeeper released from Mansfield Town, also joined the club. Defender Ryan Johnson was added after he rejected a contract from newly promoted Hartlepool United. Two more players were announced on 28 June: long-time Stevenage central midfielder Tom Pett and six-year Mansfield Town veteran full-back Mal Benning. The next arrival was 29-year old former Rotherham United striker Jamie Proctor, who signed a one-year deal.
