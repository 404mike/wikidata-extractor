Shand much later married Anne's brother, Prince Charles, as his second wife. Anne was also briefly linked to Olympic equestrian Richard Meade."]}, {"page": "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall", "response": ["Camilla was raised in East Sussex and South Kensington in England, and was educated in England, Switzerland, and France. In 1973, she married British Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles, with whom she has two children. They divorced in 1995. Camilla was periodically romantically involved with Charles both before and during each of their first marriages. Their relationship became highly publicised in the media and attracted worldwide scrutiny.Charles and Camilla: Portrait of a Love Affair, by biographer Gyles Brandreth, depicts Charles and Camilla's relationship as controversial due to its longevity. The book shows, throughout, the media's interest in the couple and representation of them to the public. In 2005, Camilla married Charles in the Windsor Guildhall, which was followed by a televised Anglican blessing at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.", "In the late 1960s, Camilla met Andrew Parker Bowles (then a Guards officer and lieutenant in the Blues and Royals) through his younger brother, Simon Parker Bowles, who worked for her father's wine firm in Mayfair. After an on-and-off relationship for years, Andrew and Camilla's engagement was announced in The Times in 1973.Graham, p. 38 Sally Bedell Smith claimed that the announcement was sent out by the pair's parents without their knowledge, which forced Andrew to propose. They married on 4 July 1973 that year in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, in London. Camilla was 25 years old and Parker Bowles 33. Her wedding dress was designed by British fashion house Bellville Sassoon, and the bridesmaids included Parker Bowles' goddaughter Lady Emma Herbert.\"Major A.H. Parker Bowles and Miss C.R. Shand\", The Times, 5 July 1973. It was considered the \"society wedding of the year\"Graham, p. 39 with eight hundred guests in attendance. Royal guests present at the ceremony and reception included Princess Anne, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.", "In December 1994, after 21 years of marriage, Camilla and her husband both issued divorce proceedings on the grounds they had been living separately for years. In July of that year, her mother Rosalind had died from osteoporosis, and her father later described this as a \"difficult time for her\". Their petition was heard and granted in January 1995 at the High Court Family Division in London. The divorce was finalised in March 1995. A year later, Andrew Parker Bowles married Rosemary Pitman (who died in 2010).Graham, p. 284", "Camilla and Prince Charles reportedly met in mid-1971. Andrew Parker Bowles had ended his relationship with Camilla in 1970 and was courting Princess Anne, Charles's sister. Though Camilla and Charles belonged to the same social circle and occasionally attended the same events, they had not formally met. Their biographer Brandreth states the couple did not first meet at a polo match, as it has been commonly believed.Mayer, p. 98 Instead, they first met at the home of their friend Luc\u00eda Santa Cruz, who formally introduced them.>Mayer, pp. 97\u201398 They became close friends and eventually began seeing one another, which was well known within their social circle.Graham, p. 29 When they became a couple, they regularly met at polo matches at Smith's Lawn in Windsor Great Park, where Charles often played polo. They also became part of a set at Annabel's in Berkeley Square. As the relationship grew more serious, Charles met Camilla's family in Plumpton and he introduced her to some members of his family.Graham, pp. 32\u201333 The relationship was put on hold after Charles travelled overseas to join the Royal Navy in early 1973, and ended abruptly afterward.", "There have been different statements on why the couple's relationship ended in 1973. Robert Lacey wrote in his 2008 book Royal: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II that Charles had met Camilla too early, and that he had not asked her to wait for him when he went overseas for military duties.Lacey, p. 268 Sarah Bradford wrote in her 2007 book Diana that a member of the close circle of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten claimed Mountbatten arranged for Charles to be taken overseas to end the relationship with Camilla, to make way for an engagement between Charles and his granddaughter Amanda Knatchbull. Some sources suggest Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother did not approve of the match with Camilla because she wanted Charles to marry one of the Spencer family granddaughters of her close friend Lady Fermoy. Other sources also suggest Camilla did not want to marry Charles but instead wanted to marry Andrew Parker Bowles, having had an on-and-off relationship with Parker Bowles since the late 1960s, or that Charles had decided he would not marry until he was thirty years old."]}, {"page": "Zara Tindall", "response": ["Zara Anne Elizabeth Phillips was born on 15 May 1981 at 8:15 pm in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London.
