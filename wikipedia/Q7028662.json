He was a right-handed batsman and off-spin bowler.\nBorn in Northumberland and educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, Peng is a graduate of the Durham Cricket Academy, who was given his chance at cricket after impressing at Chelmsford. In 2000, he became the youngest Durham player to participate in the County Championship, and on his debut in the same year he made 98 runs, since bested by an innings of 139 against Sunderland.\nHe represented England Under-19s in the 1999 European championship, and against Sri Lanka in 2000, and the next year was voted Durham's Young Player of the Year. However, having lost his first-team place in 2005 he accepted a contract to join Glamorgan.\nPeng played 79 first-class matches during his career and scored 3200 runs, with a highest score of 158, at an average of 23.70.\nIn July 2007, he announced his immediate retirement from all forms of first-class cricket. He said of the decision, \"This season I have lost confidence and belief in my ability despite trying 100%. It is not working for me or for the team and consequently I have stopped enjoying the game.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne", "response": ["* Nicky Peng (born 1982), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| 29 || Nicky Peng || 2001\u2020 || West Indies || England || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0", "| 23 || Nicky Peng || 2001/2 || 6 || 2 || 0 || 4 || 0"]}, {"page": "Durham County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*  Nicky Peng", "Durham Dynamos fell to their first defeat of their totesport League campaign at the Oval as Surrey's young batsmen avoided the loss of nine wickets which had happened in four of their five League matches so far - or, indeed, a sub-140 total, which they had been bowled out for twice so far.
