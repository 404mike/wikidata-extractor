After a goalless first half, the home side took the lead six minutes after the interval from a penalty.  Mark Golley was adjudged to have handled Lee Philpott's free kick in the Maidstone penalty area and Michael Cheetham converted the spot kick.  With a minute remaining, Maidstone levelled the score when Mark Gall scored from a rebound after Dion Dublin's header struck his own crossbar, and the match ended 1\u20131.  The second leg was played three days later at Watling Street in Dartford, Maidstone's home ground which they shared with Dartford F.C.  The first 90 minutes ended goalless which sent the match into extra time; there, goals from Dublin and Cheetham (another penalty) ensured a 3\u20131 aggregate win for Cambridge and qualification for the final."]}]}}
