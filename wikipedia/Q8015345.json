He founded the Aberdovey Slate Company that ran the Bryn Eglwys slate quarry from 1863 onwards and oversaw the construction of the associated Talyllyn Railway.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Talyllyn Railway", "response": ["Slate quarrying began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s, but although many small quarries and test levels were established, only one major quarry was developed in the region, the Bryn Eglwys quarry,  north east of the town. Underground working began in the early 1840s,Richards 1999, page 195 and by 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by packhorse to the wharf at Pennal, transferred to boats for a river trip to Aberdyfi (also spelled as Aberdovey), and then finally loaded into seagoing vessels, a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output.Boyd 1965, pages 62\u201363 In 1861 the outbreak of the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton to the mills of the north west of England and as a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was William McConnel of Lancashire who, in 1859, had purchased Hengwrt Hall near Dolgellau, north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company, which leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of Machynlleth.Boyd 1988, page 9"]}, {"page": "Margaret Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe", "response": ["She was born in Coleraine, County Londonderry, Ireland, the daughter of British soldier Frederick Bradshaw McConnel of the Gordon Highlanders and Frances Elizabeth Pringle.

"]}, {"page": "Bryn Eglwys quarry", "response": ["In 1863 a group of mill owners from Manchester, led by William McConnel, leased the quarry. Cotton shortages, caused by the American Civil War, had reduced the production of the mills and they were looking for other profitable enterprises. They formed the Aberdovey Slate Company Limited, to operate and manage the quarry, and planned to increase production at Bryn Eglwys. The main barriers to the quarry's expansion at the time were the transportation arrangements for finished slates, and the lack of a workforce near Bryn Eglwys. The new owners overcame the former difficulty by building the Talyllyn Railway, a narrow gauge railway which was designed by James Swinton Spooner. The railway ran from the Cantrybedd incline, which marked the edge of Bryn Eglwys, along the Galltymoelfre Tramway to the Alltwyllt incline, and thence down the Fathew valley to Tywyn, before turning south to reach Aberdyfi. The company built the village of Abergynolwyn to house their workers. In total, the new owners invested around \u00a3160,000, , in developing the quarry, building houses for quarrymen in the village of Abergynolwyn and building the railway from the quarry to Tywyn.", "Neither the quarry nor its associated railway were great commercial successes, and by 1879 the company had run out of funds. Both quarry and railway were put up for auction on 9 October 1879.   After this and a subsequent auction failed to find a bidder, William McConnel personally bought both. In August 1880 a major storm burst the quarry's reservoir and required major capital to repair. Nevertheless, McConnel re-organised the quarry's finances, and there was then an upturn in the slate market which allowed the quarry to expand further."]}, {"page": "Tinsley Park Collieries", "response": ["The first shaft was sunk in 1852.
