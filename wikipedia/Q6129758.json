The focus of railway traffic was movement from the hinterland to the ports and cities on the coast, so governments were not concerned about the future need for either inter-city passenger or freight services. It was not until 1883 when the broad and standard gauge lines from Melbourne and Sydney met at Albury, and in 1888, narrow and standard gauge from Brisbane and Sydney met at Wallangarra that the break of gauge became an issue. The issue of rail gauge was mentioned in an 1889 military defence report authored by English army officer Major General James Bevan Edwards, who said that the full benefit of the railways would not be attained until a uniform gauge was established. It needs to be remembered, however, that until federation (1901) the benefits of a uniform gauge were not immediately apparent, as passengers would have to pass through customs and immigration at the intercolonial border, meaning that all goods would have to be removed for customs inspection. It was only with Federation in 1901, and the introduction of free trade between the states, that the impediment of different gauges became apparent."]}, {"page": "Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir James Bevan Edwards"]}, {"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["*8 July \u2013 James Bevan Edwards, army officer and politician, 86"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|Sir James Bevan Edwards"]}, {"page": "Fort Glanville Conservation Park", "response": ["Work began in 1882 on Fort Glanville's northern sister Fort Largs\u2014then known as the Port Adelaide battery\u2014to the same specification as Fort Glanville; its barracks and rear defence wall were finished in 1885.

South Australia was experiencing a depression in 1886 and that coupled with a report by General James Bevan Edwards scuttled plans for the third coastal fort.
