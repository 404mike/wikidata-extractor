He helped the club keep three consecutive clean sheets between 20 August 2005 and 10 September 2005. Despite serving a suspension for picking up five yellow cards this season so far, Hall continued to start eleven matches in the centre\u2013back position, forming a partnership with Darren Ward. This lasted until he missed one match, due to suffering from a knock during a 1\u20131 draw against rivals, Millwall on 3 December 2005 and was substituted in the 59th minute. Halfway through the season, many Crystal Palace fans felt that Hall's performance was being hindered by the burden of captaincy, and after several poor performances, and several yellow cards, Hughes was re-appointed team captain in January 2006. Despite losing the captaincy, Hall remained in the first team until the end of the season, where at one point, he played in a full\u2013back position. During a 1\u20130 win against Cardiff City on 4 February 2006, Hall received a straight red card following an off-the-ball incident involving Joe Ledley and served a three match suspension. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the starting line\u2013up, in a 1\u20131 draw against rivals, Millwall on 18 February 2006. This was followed up by scoring his second goal of the season, in a 4\u20131 win against Norwich City. After missing two matches due to another injury, his return saw him contribute to the club's place in the Championship play\u2013offs. Hall played in both legs of the Championship play\u2013offs against Watford, as Crystal Palace lost 3\u20130. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he went on to make forty\u2013four appearances and scoring once in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Tommy Miller", "response": ["On 20 February, following the departure of Paolo Di Canio, Swindon announced that along with Darren Ward, Miller would be taking temporary charge of the squad for the game against Preston on 23 February."]}, {"page": "Elliott Ward", "response": ["He is the brother of Scott Ward and Hemel Hempstead Town defender Darren Ward, who turned down the opportunity of joining West Ham and the Premiership, at the start of the 2005\u201306 season, instead opting for Championship side Crystal Palace, claiming he did not want to keep his brother out of the team."]}]}}
