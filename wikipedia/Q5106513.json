A chance to move further away from the bottom three was curtailed by the postponement of the last game before Christmas at Wigan Athletic. The Christmas programme started with a 1\u20131 draw at Lancashire rivals Burnley, managed by Bolton's former striker Owen Coyle, before former Bolton player and assistant manager Phil Brown brought his Hull side to the Reebok. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw after Bolton had led 2\u20130, the home fans loudly booing the decision to replace goalscorer Ivan Klasni\u0107 with Gavin McCann while leading 2\u20131.

The news was a surprise to all supporters of football across the country and Sheffield Wednesday fans were unhappy with the dismissal of manager and Wednesday supporter himself Gary Megson. With Milan Mandaric taking such a big decision, it was in hope of 'still reaching the automatic promotion spot', although still with some games left it would prove to be a very difficult, and looking an almost impossible task for any manager. With rivals Sheffield United second in the league, having the potential to go eight points clear and although losing against Wednesday still seemingly in good form. And a team in such a high position in the league and having a much bigger goal difference the chances of Sheffield Wednesday catching them up and going ahead of them looked very slim. Assistant manager Chris Evans and first-team coach Neil Thompson were confirmed to take control of first-team affairs until a new appointment was made. Milan Mandaric was expected to make a quick appointment as a loss of such large possible consequences, it was sure a particular new manager was in mind. Also as well as the fans' anger, they were worried the effect of the dismissal of Megson would have on the players. After, scoring such a valuable and pride winning goal majority of the players went over to hug Gary Megson, showing a strong player-to-manager relationship. On 2 March Sheffield Wednesday announced a press conference where confirmed the expected appointment of new manager Dave Jones. Dave Jones was rumoured to take the job ever since and before Gary Megson's dismissal. The game against Rochdale the next day finished goalless with Dave Jones watching from the sidelines. Meanwhile, at Sheffield an amazing game took place at Bramall Lane, as Sheffield United were leading comfortably by 2\u20130 at half time before Oldham Athletic scored two in four minutes to equalise, and then The Blades went down to ten men and then nine as they conceded a penalty in the last minute of the game. Former-Sheffield Wednesday striker Shefki Kuqi scored from the spot and Oldham Athletic won 2\u20133. This meant Sheffield Wednesday caught up by one point. Dave Jones's first game in charge was shortly after his appointment in a mid-week game at Hillsborough Stadium against Bury. The Owls took an early lead on the eleventh minute with Michail Antonio getting his first goal for the club, Antonio went on to score another as Gary Madine and Ryan Lowe scored as Wednesday won 4\u20131, a great start to Dave Jones's Sheffield Wednesday managerial career. Meanwhile, Walsall won Sheffield United 3\u20132, The Owls catching-up by a further three points meaning they were one point behind, however Sheffield United still had a game in hand meaning they could potentially be four points ahead. A second consecutive home game saw Sheffield Wednesday face Bournemouth. Fans could not believe their eyes as goals from Danny Batth, Miles Addison (own goal), and Michail Antonio saw Wednesday 3\u20130 up inside ten minutes, but that is how the game finished. Sheffield Wednesday were disappointed however as Sheffield United managed to get back to winning ways as they won Brentford 0\u20132, their wonder top-scorer Ched Evans getting both. Mid-week saw The Blades play their game in hand and drew 1\u20131 with Colchester United and suddenly was only two points ahead after having the potential to be eight just weeks before. Also, young goalkeeper was loaned to Worksop Town for the rest of the season to get some experience around a first-team squad. Sheffield Wednesday however faced Notts County the next weekend away, and they were incredible form, having been 4\u20130 up on top of the league Charlton Athletic at just half-time. A tough battle as it was expected to be fortunately saw Sheffield Wednesday win 1\u20132, by far Dave Jones's toughest game yet. Goals from Ryan Lowe and Gary Madine, before Lloyd Sam pulled a late goal back for Notts County. At Bramall Lane Sheffield United only drew with Tranmere Rovers, meaning Sheffield Wednesday were now level on points, however The Blades had a significant better goal difference. Back at Hillsborough Stadium and The Owls faced Walsall, the team that brought back bad memories for Wednesday fans having conceded two goals in stoppage time the last time the teams met. At half-time it was goalless while Sheffield United were comfortably beating Notts County by a surprisingly large amount of 0\u20134. With The Blades bound to win their game, Sheffield Wednesday had to stay on track with them. However, Sheffield Wednesday found themselves 1\u20132 down and after pushing late for an equaliser, it was the last kick of the game as Gary Madine scored in the ninety-fifth minute against relegation-threatened Walsall. The fans went home disappointed as they felt it was a game they could have won, however it was seconds away from being a 'catastrophy' as Dave Jones described it. After not impressing in the team, loanee John Bostock was recalled by Tottenham Hotspur after making six appearances for the club, meanwhile as the emergency-loan transfer market came towards a close Dave Jones brought in Keith Treacy on loan from Burnley and Nile Ranger on loan from Newcastle United \u2013 both on loan until the end of the season. The next game was against Leyton Orient, Reda Johnson's goal won the game for The Owls, as both Keith Treacy and Nile Ranger made their debuts for the club after coming off the bench. Sheffield United did not play as their opponents Chesterfield played in the Football League Trophy, this meaning that Sheffield Wednesday temporarily went into second as Sheffield United played rivals Chesterfield mid-week and won 4\u20131. The last game of a quite long, but incredible month, came and Sheffield Wednesday featured in an early kick-off live on Sky Sports. They won 2\u20130, after a double-brace by Madine, while later Sheffield United also won again 0\u20131. Both teams in form, it set up a fantastic end of the season as April came closer and could decide the two fierce rivals between automatic promotion and who would have to settle for the play-offs."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|Chris Evans"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|Chris Evans"]}, {"page": "Mark Connolly", "response": ["Connolly was signed from Wolverhampton Wanderers by Bolton Wanderers on the summer transfer deadline in 2009 after the clubs agreed a \u00a31,000,000 fee.
