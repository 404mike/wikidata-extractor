Our readers finish reading one and they can download the next.\" Author Sharon Kendrick's opinion is similar: \"[Mills & Boon] are an intense reading experience, and they can be read quickly. People read four to five in a few days so that's a lot of books to carry around.\"", "According to Mills & Boon author Sharon Kendrick, \"the sheikh represents the ultimate female fantasy.\" Penny Jordan adds that the hero often has a softer side, which the heroine will discover during the course of the novel: \"He's often damaged by something that's happened in his life, often to do with money. He will be more outrageous to the heroine, and harder on her. He realises he is beginning to feel, he has to resolve that conflict.\""]}, {"page": "Category talk:Romantic fiction writers/to do", "response": ["Sharon Kendrick -"]}, {"page": "Emma Darcy", "response": ["*Risque Business (2005) (with Liz Fielding and Sharon Kendrick)", "*At the Billionaire's Bidding (2009) (with Sharon Kendrick and Melanie Milburne)"]}, {"page": "Anne Mather", "response": ["* Exotic Heat (2002) (Anne Mather, Sandra Field and Sharon Kendrick)"]}, {"page": "Carole Mortimer", "response": ["*In the Boss's Bed (2004) (Carole Mortimer / Seduced by the boss by Sharon Kendrick / Dating her boss by Liz Fielding)"]}, {"page": "Jessica Steele", "response": ["* Bedded by Her Boss (2007) (with Amanda Browning and Sharon Kendrick)"]}, {"page": "Miranda Lee", "response": ["*Virgin Brides (2005) (with Sharon Kendrick and Kate Walker)", "*Her Secret Child (2008) (with Sharon Kendrick and Cathy Williams)"]}, {"page": "Leigh Michaels", "response": ["*Bachelors' Babies (2001) (with Lynne Graham and Sharon Kendrick)"]}, {"page": "Lindsay Armstrong", "response": ["*Her Outback Boss (2009) (with Barbara Hannay and Sharon Kendrick)"]}, {"page": "Lucy Gordon (writer)", "response": ["*Claiming His Mistress (2004) (with Helen Bianchin and Sharon Kendrick)"]}, {"page": "Sandra Marton", "response": ["*Christmas Affairs (1998) (with Helen Bianchin and Sharon Kendrick)"]}, {"page": "Lynne Graham", "response": ["*Bachelors' Babies (2001) (with Sharon Kendrick and Leigh Michaels)"]}, {"page": "Helen Bianchin", "response": ["* Christmas Affairs (1998) (with Sharon Kendrick and Sandra Marton)", "* Claiming His Mistress (2004) (with Lucy Gordon and Sharon Kendrick)", "* Latin Affairs (2006) (with Sharon Kendrick and Kathryn Ross)"]}, {"page": "Kate Walker (writer)", "response": ["*Society Weddings (2002) (with Sharon Kendrick)", "*Virgin Brides (2005) (with Sharon Kendrick and Miranda Lee)", "*In the Sheikh's Bed (2005) (with Sharon Kendrick and Michelle Reid)"]}, {"page": "Liz Fielding", "response": ["*In the Boss's Bed (2004) (with Sharon Kendrick and Carole Mortimer)", "*Risque Business (2005) (with Emma Darcy and Sharon Kendrick)"]}, {"page": "Catherine Spencer", "response": ["*Secret Passions (2007) (with Amanda Browning and Sharon Kendrick)"]}, {"page": "Marion Lennox", "response": ["*Comfort and Joy (1997) (with Lynne Collins, Sharon Kendrick and Laura MacDonald)"]}, {"page": "Kathryn Ross (writer)", "response": ["*Latin Affairs (2006) (with Helen Bianchin and Sharon Kendrick)"]}]}}
