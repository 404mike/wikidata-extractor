Under this Act the Treasury issued \u00a3 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2013) of paper banknotes, without the backing of gold, with which the banks could repay their obligations. Leading banker Walter Leaf described these Treasury notes as \"essentially a War Loan free of interest, for an unlimited period, and as such was a highly profitable expedient from the point of view of the Government\"."]}, {"page": "Tenedos", "response": ["According to a reconstruction, based on the myth of Tenes, Walter Leaf stated that the first inhabitants of the island could be Pelasgians, who were driven out of the Anatolian mainland by the Phrygians.
