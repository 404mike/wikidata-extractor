As player, he made more than 400 appearances in the Football League as a centre half for Carlisle United, Gillingham, Bristol Rovers, Plymouth Argyle and Torquay United. As manager, he took charge of Torquay United.\nGreen was born in Carlisle, Cumberland, and began his career as an apprentice with Carlisle United, turning professional in September 1964. He played only two league games for Carlisle, both the following season, before moving to Gillingham in July 1968. He soon found a regular place at the Priestfield Stadium, playing 132 league games, scoring 24 goals.He moved to Bristol Rovers in July 1971 and was appointed captain of the Eastville side. In July 1974, after 2 goals in 77 games, he moved to Plymouth Argyle for a fee of \u00a319,000. He captained Argyle to promotion from Division Three at the end of his first season at Home Park, going onto play 108 league games, scoring 8 goals, before leaving for local rivals Torquay United in March 1977 as player-manager for a fee of \u00a35,000.\nWorking with the experienced Frank O'Farrell as the general manager, he put together an attacking side at Plainmoor, but could never get them challenging for promotion, not helped by the lack of funds at his disposal. He retired from playing, after 88 league games and 7 goals, to concentrate on his managerial duties. During the 1979\u201380 season he surprisingly turned down an offer to manage Second Division Bristol Rovers to remain at Plainmoor, but was sacked in May 1981 after a disappointing season, with O'Farrell taking over as team manager for a third time.He subsequently played for local non-league side Newton Abbot and later managed a sub-post office in Torquay.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["O'Farrell made a return to Plainmoor in 1976 when Malcolm Musgrove lost his job after a disappointing FA Cup defeat against non-league outfit Hillingdon Borough.

He began the 1972\u201373 season as first choice in the centre of defence, though soon moved back to right-back in a reshuffle of the team. He was an ever-present until the local derby against Exeter City on Boxing Day 1972, but played just five games in the remainder of the season. Manager Jack Edwards was replaced by Malcolm Musgrove, and Boulton was an ever-present in 1973\u201374. The \"Gulls\" continued to battle in the bottom half of the table in 1974\u201375, before reaching ninth in 1975\u201376. Musgrove was replaced by Frank O'Farrell, who was in turn replaced by Mike Green, in a chaotic campaign in 1976\u201377. He was deployed as an emergency centre-forward at Doncaster Rovers in August 1976, and scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win. He was named the club's Player of the Season in 1976\u201377. Boulton remained a regular until the end of the 1977\u201378 season, as Torquay again finished ninth. However, he played just eleven times in the 1978\u201379 season, with his final game for Torquay coming on the final day of the season, a 1\u20130 defeat away to Rochdale. He left Plainmoor that summer, and was awarded a testimonial by Torquay with a friendly match against Southampton on 15 January 1980. In total he played 286 games for the club in league and cup competitions, scoring 36 goals.Edwards, Leigh; Jon Gibbes, John Lovis (1999).
