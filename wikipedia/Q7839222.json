Born in Holmfirth, Yorkshire, he played as a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper for Somerset.\nHolmes made a single first-class appearance for the team, during the 1969 season, against the touring West Indians. Holmes scored a duck in the first innings in which he batted, and 8 runs in the second, as Somerset lost the match by a wide margin. According to one account, Holmes' selection for Somerset was \"on the strength of a 2nd XI match at Pontypridd and typical surge of enthusiasm from the current coach, Bill Andrews\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Trevor Holmes (1969) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "Charlie Carter (cricketer)", "response": ["Carter moved into Somerset's first team for the final two matches of the 1968 season following the decision of regular wicket-keeper Dickie Brooks not to continue a first-class cricket career. Though Carter scored only one run in his four innings that season, he was handed a contract for 1969 and played in all 24 County Championship matches in the 1969 season, though Trevor Holmes was picked for the other first-class fixture against the West Indians. In an unsuccessful season for Somerset \u2013 the county finished bottom of the Championship table for the first time since 1955 \u2013 Carter was singled out for praise in Wisden. He was, it said, \"extremely enthusiastic\" and had \"developed into a most capable performer\". He appeared less frequently in one-day cricket: the 1969 season was the first season of the new John Player League, a 40-over competition played on Sundays, but Carter played in only a few matches, Somerset generally preferring the more reliable batting of Roy Virgin, who could keep wicket adequately."]}, {"page": "Sanjoy", "response": ["The front single for Dance Under the Influence, Slip Away, introduced the American Idol nominee Trevor Holmes as his first collaboration and single.
