He was born in Bath, Somerset and died at Lucknam Park, near Colerne, Wiltshire.\nWalmesley was educated at Winchester College and at St John's College, Cambridge. He was in the cricket eleven at Winchester as a middle-order batsman, but in the 1836 Cambridge trial match, he batted at No 11, though he still managed to be the team's top-scorer in the second innings, with 13 not out. His sole first-class match, the game against the Cambridge Town Club, followed less than two weeks later, and he scored 1 and 2 not out, batting at No 8; he played no further matches.Walmesley graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1839, which converted automatically to a Master of Arts in 1842. He became a lawyer, being called to the bar in 1842 and specialising in equity draftsmanship and conveyancing. Around 1870, he acquired the Lucknam Park estate and became a justice of the peace for Wiltshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lucknam Park", "response": ["The new owner was Richard Walmesley. Later Lucknam passed to his son, Johnnie. Both were typical Victorian squires, helping the poor, entering into the life of the county and funding building in the district. Johnnie's only son was killed in the Great War and he was so affected by the loss that he sold Lucknam in 1918 to Sir Read."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Richard Walmesley"]}, {"page": "Walmesley, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Walmesley"]}]}}
