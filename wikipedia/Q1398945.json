His works are in about 50 articles and a few separate publications.A list of Boole's memoirs and papers is in the Catalogue of Scientific Memoirs published by the Royal Society, and in the supplementary volume on differential equations, edited by Isaac Todhunter. To the Cambridge Mathematical Journal and its successor, the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, Boole contributed 22 articles in all. In the third and fourth series of the Philosophical Magazine are found 16 papers. The Royal Society printed six memoirs in the Philosophical Transactions, and a few other memoirs are to be found in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Royal Irish Academy, in the Bulletin de l'Acad\u00e9mie de St-P\u00e9tersbourg for 1862 (under the name G.

It is the first practical treatise on Elasticity; and one of the first attempts to make searching experiments on the elastic properties of beams. It is not only valuable as containing the total knowledge of that day on the subject, but also by reason of an admirable historical introduction... The work appears to have been begun in 1787 and portions of it presented to the Academie in 1792.

By 1849, he had coached almost 200 wranglers, of whom 17 were senior wranglers including Arthur Cayley and G. G. Stokes.

The final edition is a treatise of some 162 pages. The fundamental goal of the text is to supply an answer to the question as to whether the earth acquired its present form from originally being in a fluid state. The book is organised in two parts, the first takes Newton's law of universal gravitation as starting point, calculates the resulting force exerted at a point by a total mass in forms ranging from sphere to spheroid and subsequently to an irregular mass consisting of nearly spherical layers approximating more and more to the case of the earth.  The second part is concerned with calculating the shape of the earth based first on the hypothesis of it being a fluid and then on geodetic principles. Part of his work was extensively used verbatim by Isaac Todhunter in his Treatise on Analytical Statics (1853)."]}, {"page": "Edward Routh", "response": ["Routh obtained his BA (1849) and MA (1853) in London.
