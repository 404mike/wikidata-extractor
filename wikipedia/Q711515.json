Albums were also released from both series. He also recorded Keith Hopwood's and Malcolm Rowe's theme song to Cosgrove Hall's adaptation of The Wind in the Willows, and this was released as a single in 1984 after the series was aired on ITV.\nMcTell's guitar playing has been modelled on the style of the US's country blues guitar players of the early 20th century, including Blind Blake, Robert Johnson and Blind Willie McTell. These influences led a friend to suggest that he change his professional name to McTell as his career was beginning to take shape.McTell is also an accomplished performer on piano and harmonica, which he uses on a harness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blind Blake", "response": ["His complex and intricate fingerpicking inspired Reverend Gary Davis, Jorma Kaukonen, Ry Cooder, Arlen Roth, John Fahey, Ralph McTell, David Bromberg, Leon Redbone and many others.

I never had seed then and I haven't to this day yet seed no one that could take his natural fingers and pick as much guitar as Blind Blake.\"Lomax, Alan., 'The Land Where The Blues Began', Minerva, 1993, pp.443"]}, {"page": "Blind Willie McTell", "response": ["McTell's influence extended over a wide variety of artists, including the Allman Brothers Band, who covered his \"Statesboro Blues\", and Bob Dylan, who paid tribute to him in his 1983 song \"Blind Willie McTell\", the refrain of which is \"And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell\". Other artists influenced by McTell include Taj Mahal, Alvin Youngblood Hart, Ralph McTell, Chris Smither, Jack White, and the White Stripes.", "One of McTell's most famous songs, \"Statesboro Blues\", was frequently performed by the Allman Brothers Band; it also contributes to Canned Heat's \"Goin' Up the Country\". A short list of some of the artists who have performed the song includes Taj Mahal, David Bromberg, Dave Van Ronk, The Devil Makes Three and Ralph McTell, who changed his name on account of liking the song.Hockenhull, Chris (1997).

Jack White, of the White Stripes considers McTell an influence; the White Stripes album De Stijl (2000) is dedicated to him and features a cover of his song \"Southern Can Is Mine\". The White Stripes also covered McTell's \"Lord, Send Me an Angel\", releasing it as a single in 2000.

The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \"Nick was monosyllabic.
