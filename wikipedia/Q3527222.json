He was primarily an opening batsman, noted especially for the quality of his off-drive. Neville Cardus wrote that he \"was amongst the most precisely technical and most prolific batsmen of any time in the annals of cricket.\" He was only the second batsman to reach the landmark of 100 first-class centuries, following WG Grace. In the 1906 English season he scored 3,518 runs, a record aggregate since surpassed only by Denis Compton and Bill Edrich in 1947.", "link_mentions": {}}}
