He was primarily an opening batsman, noted especially for the quality of his off-drive. Neville Cardus wrote that he \"was amongst the most precisely technical and most prolific batsmen of any time in the annals of cricket.\" He was only the second batsman to reach the landmark of 100 first-class centuries, following WG Grace. In the 1906 English season he scored 3,518 runs, a record aggregate since surpassed only by Denis Compton and Bill Edrich in 1947.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 29", "response": ["*1871 \u2013 Tom Hayward, English cricketer (d. 1939)"]}, {"page": "1900s (decade)", "response": ["*Tom Hayward"]}, {"page": "1904 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Tom Hayward 3170 @ 54.65 (HS 203)"]}, {"page": "1906 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Tom Hayward 3518 @ 66.37 (HS 219)"]}, {"page": "1907 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Tom Hayward 2353 @ 45.25 (HS 161)"]}, {"page": "1908 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Tom Hayward 2337 @ 45.82 (HS 175)"]}, {"page": "1894 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Young Batsmen of the Season \u2013 Bill Brockwell, Jack Brown, C B Fry, Tom Hayward, Archie MacLaren"]}, {"page": "Jack Hobbs", "response": ["Born into poverty in 1882, Hobbs wished from an early age to pursue a career in cricket. His early batting was undistinguished, but a sudden improvement in 1901 brought him to the attention of local teams. In 1903 he successfully applied to join Surrey, with the support of England batsman Tom Hayward. His reputation grew and when he qualified to play for Surrey, he scored 88 on his first-class debut and a century in his next game. Over the following seasons, he established himself as a successful county player and in 1908 made his Test debut for England, scoring 83 in his first innings. After some mixed early performances for England, Hobbs' success against South African googly bowlers made his place secure, and by 1911\u201312, when he scored three centuries in the Test series against Australia, critics judged him the world's best batsman. In county cricket, he developed an attacking, dynamic style of play and was very successful up until 1914. After serving in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, he maintained his reputation when cricket resumed in 1919, but his career was threatened by appendicitis, which caused him to miss most of the 1921 season. When he returned, he was a more cautious batsman and used a safer style of play. Subsequently, he became more consistent and scored prolifically in both Test and domestic cricket until his retirement. In this period, he played some of his most acclaimed innings.", "Hobbs' success was based on fast footwork, an ability to play many different shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket, in terms of average partnership, in Test history. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.", "Hobbs' breakthrough came in 1901. His batting improved throughout the season, during which he scored 102 for Ainsworth against the Cambridge Liberals, his first century. At the end of the season, he was included in a Cambridge XI, a team chosen from the best local cricketers, to play a prestigious match against a team of professional cricketers brought by the Cambridge-born Surrey cricketer Tom Hayward.McKinstry, pp. 38\u201339. Hobbs' overall record was unremarkable, but at the end of the season he was invited to play as an amateur for Cambridgeshire; he achieved little in his appearances.Mason, p. 21.", "By the start of the 1905 season, Hobbs had qualified for Surrey and was already being noted as a player of promise.McKinstry, p. 54. At the time, Surrey needed an opening batsman to partner Tom Hayward. Although Hobbs had rarely opened the batting,Mason, p. 37. he was selected as Hayward's opening partner for Surrey's first game of the season. He made his debut on 24 April 1905 against a team representing the \"Gentlemen of England\"; after scoring 18 runs in the first innings, he scored a rapid 88 in the second before rain ensured the match was drawn. The Surrey team and committee were impressed,McKinstry, pp. 54\u201357. and Hobbs retained his place for the club's opening County Championship match against Essex. When he scored 155 runs in around three hours during Surrey's second innings, the Surrey captain Lord Dalmeny awarded Hobbs his County Cap.Arlott, p. 29. Over the following weeks, Hobbs scored consistently, hitting another century against Essex and 94 runs against the touring Australian cricket team.McKinstry, pp. 57\u201359. But a combination of fatigue from continuous cricket and the pressure of first-class cricket adversely affected his form, and he struggled for the remainder of the season even as the county tried various measures to help him.Arlott, pp. 30\u201333. In first-class cricket that season, Hobbs scored 1,317 runs at an average of 25.82, including two centuries and four other scores over fifty, to finish ninth in the Surrey batting averages.McKinstry, p. 64. As an occasional medium-paced bowler, he took six wickets.McKinstry, p. 61. Reviewing Surrey's season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack singled Hobbs out for attention, praising his early-season form; it suggested that he was the best professional batsman Surrey had found for a long time. The Times noted that, while performing well, Hobbs had fallen short of the standards suggested by his start."]}, {"page": "1947 in sports", "response": ["* Denis Compton and Bill Edrich both beat Tom Hayward\u2019s 1906 record of 3,518 runs in a first-class season."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Tom Hayward"]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a time when the university was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war.Douglas, p. 21.

Between the two World Wars, Surrey often had a good side, but it tended to be stronger in batting than in bowling; Hobbs played until 1934 with another good opening partner in Andrew Sandham. Hobbs scored more runs (61,760) and compiled more centuries (199) in first-class cricket than any other player in the history of the game.

His debut came in a match against the MCC; after scoring 77 not out in his first innings and then taking six wickets, he scored his maiden first-class century in the second. In 155 minutes, he scored 150 runs and took his team close to an improbable victory; he became increasingly attacking throughout the innings and dominated the scoring.
