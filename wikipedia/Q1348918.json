The Turn-220 had never been commonly contested in the US. 220s were normally raced on \"NoTurn\" or \"Straight\" courses. In 1951 the IAAF commenced to establish world records for the Turn-200-Meters: the initial listing accepted was by Willie Applegarth of Great Britain in 21 1/5, set in London in 1914. That spring of 1951, Stanfield's Intercollegiate 220-Yard Dash in 20.6 was established by the IAAF as a new World-Record for the 200 m with 20.6 (220 yards is more than one meter longer than 200 meters)."]}]}}
