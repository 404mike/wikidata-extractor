The Birmingham Sports Argus described how \"if Peter's role [back-up goalkeeper to Wood] has denied him the glamour of a glorious achievement in action, he has his share of personal glamour. He's a tall fair-haired good looker, and so comely, that he was described as the film star of Highfield Road. Is single too.\" Taylor did not stay single for long however, and married Lily Thorpe in June 1951."]}]}}
