For instance, if m is odd, then n\u00a0\u2212\u00a0m is also odd, and if m is even, then n\u00a0\u2212\u00a0m is even, a non-trivial relation because, besides the number 2, only odd numbers can be prime.  Similarly, if n is divisible by 3, and m was already a prime distinct from 3, then n\u00a0\u2212\u00a0m would also be coprime to 3 and thus be slightly more likely to be prime than a general number.  Pursuing this type of analysis more carefully, G. H. Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood in 1923 conjectured (as part of their Hardy\u2013Littlewood prime tuple conjecture) that for any fixed c\u00a0\u2265\u00a02, the number of representations of a large integer n as the sum of c primes n = p_1 + \\cdots + p_c with p_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq p_c should be asymptotically equal to"]}, {"page": "East of England", "response": ["Sun to be determined. In 1938 at Cambridge, Mary Cartwright developed chaos theory with John Edensor Littlewood; Edward Norton Lorenz, a meteorologist from the US, would mainly develop chaos theory in 1963, and the butterfly effect in 1969.

In 1966, Cambridge geophysicists Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews proved the theory of plate tectonics and continental drift; plate tectonics was first suggested at Cambridge by Dan McKenzie; continental drift had first been proposed, though not extensively proved, by the German Alfred Wegener in 1912.

This (along with much else) led to quantitative progress on Waring's problem, as part of the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method, as it became known. In prime number theory, they proved results and some notable conditional results. This was a major factor in the development of number theory as a system of conjectures; examples are the first and second Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjectures. Hardy's collaboration with Littlewood is among the most successful and famous collaborations in mathematical history.
