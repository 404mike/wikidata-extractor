Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond with Edmund Hordern (former test pilot of Heston Aircraft Company Ltd.) originally formed the company with the intention of producing aircraft of their own design, specifically the Hordern-Richmond Autoplane, based at Denham Aerodrome. As the time did not appear appropriate, effort was concentrated on the production of wooden airscrews, with the intention of using plastics and compressed woods for the same purpose at a later date. The company employed A.A.D. Lang, who had long experience of airscrew production and Tony Fletcher as chief designer. Hordern-Richmond merged with Lang Propellers of Weybridge, and a new factory was built at Haddenham, near Thame, Buckinghamshire. In April 1940 Flight magazine reported that the de Havilland company acquired an interest in the company with A.S. Butler taking a seat on the board."]}, {"page": "Frederick Charles Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond"]}]}}
