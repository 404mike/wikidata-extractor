Prior to her work in Kashmir and other parts of India, Butler was a part of the first class of the London School of Medicine for Women, becoming a member of the forefront of female doctors. Butler spent seven years in India until her death in 1889 and opened medical dispensaries in Srinagar and Bhagalpur, where no medical facilities had previously existed. Butler also initiated the building of the first hospital in Srinagar in 1888 called the John Bishop Memorial Hospital and provided necessary medical care for Indian women, for whom little care had been available.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isabella Bird", "response": ["Isabella Lucy Bird, married name Bishop  (15 October 1831 \u2013 7 October 1904), was a nineteenth-century British explorer, writer, photographer, and naturalist. With Fanny Jane Butler she founded the John Bishop Memorial hospital in Srinagar. She was the first woman to be elected Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.", "Arriving on the subcontinent in February 1889, Bird visited missions in India, visited Ladakh on the borders of Tibet, and then travelled in Persia, Kurdistan, and Turkey. In India, the Maharajah of Kashmir gave her a piece of land on which to build a hospital with sixty beds and a dispensary for women; there she worked with Fanny Jane Butler to found the John Bishop Memorial Hospital in memory of her recently deceased husband who had left funds for this purpose in his will. The following year, she joined a group of British soldiers travelling between Baghdad and Tehran. She remained with the unit's commanding officer during his survey work in the region, armed with her revolver and a medicine chest supplied \u2013 in possibly an early example of corporate sponsorship \u2013 by Henry Wellcome's company in London. In 1891, she travelled through Baluchistan to Persia and Armenia, exploring the source of the Karun river and later that year she gave a speech in a committee room of the House of Commons on the persecution of Christians in Kurdistan, on which she had made representations to the Grand Vizier of the Turkish Empire."]}, {"page": "London School of Medicine for Women", "response": ["* Fanny Jane Butler, in first graduating class, 1880; known as first English, fully trained medical missionary in India"]}, {"page": "List of women in the Heritage Floor", "response": ["| An explorer, naturalist, photographer, and writer.
