City were relegated at the end of the 1977\u201378 season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Division Two championship in 1980. Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous home-grown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner Alan Smith, who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down."]}, {"page": "Bill Shankly", "response": ["The two Scottish players were centre half Ron Yeats and centre forward Ian St John from Dundee United and Motherwell respectively.Kelly, pp. 160\u2013165.

At a press conference when Yeats came to Liverpool, Shankly emphasised Yeats' height by inviting the journalists to \"go and walk round him; he's a colossus!\"Kelly, p. 165. Goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came through the club's junior teams, so Shankly now had his \"strength through the middle\" and the team building continued with the acquisition of wing half Gordon Milne from Preston. Other players developed at Anfield were Jimmy Melia, Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and the future England internationals Gerry Byrne and Roger Hunt.

This led to Mercer moving upstairs to become general manager at Manchester City in October 1971, with Allison taking over as team manager. Mercer left Manchester City at the end of the season and became manager of Coventry City, whom he managed from 1972 to 1974. During the same time Mercer was also caretaker manager of the England national football team for a brief period in 1974 after Sir Alf Ramsey's resignation. During his time in charge England won the 1974 British Home Championship title which was shared with Scotland. In total Mercer was in charge for seven games, winning three of them, drawing another three and losing one. The FA was so impressed by these performances that questions arose about the possibility of Mercer taking the job on a longer-term basis, with, as an assistant, his Coventry City protege Gordon Milne. Mercer, too, seemed open to persuasion but the FA was working on another plan, putting out feelers to the most successful English club manager available, Leeds United's Don Revie."]}, {"page": "Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.", "response": ["====1987\u20131993: Gordon Milne era====", "Be\u015fikta\u015f had their most successful run in the S\u00fcper Lig with three consecutive championships under the management of Gordon Milne in the early 1990s.

He signed for the English club, along with Motherwell teammate Ally Mauchlen, for a combined fee of \u00a3350,000 in August 1985. Although Mauchlen's greater experience cast McAllister as the 'make-weight' in the deal, he soon rose to prominence as an attacking force in Leicester midfield, impressing manager and fans alike with his accurate passing to feet, and confident range of skills on the ball. During his first season at Filbert Street he adapted well to regular First Division football, and began to rise to prominence in creating chances for a team that included Steve Lynex and Alan Smith."]}]}}
