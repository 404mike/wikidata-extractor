On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he was commissioned on the General List. He transferred to the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1916, ending the war as a Brevet Major and being appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. Born with the surname Robertson, he assumed the triple-barelled name Fitzwarenne-Despencer-Robertson on 17 July 1916, in accordance with the wishes of the late Edmund Fitzwarenne-Despencer; however only two of his surnames were regularly used.\nAt the 1922 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament for the Islington West constituency in London. However his small majority was not sustained at the 1923 election, and was unsuccessful when he contested the seat again in the elections of 1924 and 1929.However, in 1931, he was elected as MP for the Salisbury constituency in Wiltshire, at a by-election on 11 March following the resignation of the Conservative MP Hugh Morrison. Despencer-Robertson held this seat until his death. On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 he was commissioned on the General List and served until his death as Military Secretary at Headquarters Southern Command, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He died in 1942 at the relatively young age of 55, possibly due to a heart attack brought on by overwork.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Salisbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Despencer-Robertson "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|James Despencer-Robertson "]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "Islington West (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom by-election records", "response": ["*1942 Salisbury by-election: James Despencer-Robertson died suddenly, apparently from overwork as military secretary at Southern Command Headquarters. b"]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|Lieutenant-Colonel||James Despencer-Robertson||1886||1942||Died suddenly, apparently from overwork as military secretary at Southern Command Headquarters||Conservative Party||Salisbury||OBE"]}, {"page": "James Fitzwarenne Despencer-Robertson", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "James Archibald St. George Fitzwarenne Despencer-Robertson", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "James Archibald St George Fitzwarenne Despencer-Robertson", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "James Archibald Despencer-Robertson", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "James Archibald St.George Fitzwarenne Despencer-Robertson", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "James Archibald St.George Fitzwarrenne-Despencer-Robertson", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Despencer-Robertson"]}, {"page": "1931 Salisbury by-election", "response": ["The Salisbury by-election, 1931 was a by-election held for the British House of Commons constituency of Salisbury in Wiltshire on 11 March 1931.
