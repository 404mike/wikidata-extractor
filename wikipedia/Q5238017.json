The idea was extremely important for his development as a composer, and during the next 17 years most of his work was done using the same technique or variations of it. In this particular case the basic structure is 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, and a single unit contains 16 bars. So the composition begins with four units of 16 bars each, then the next section has three units, the third has two, and so on. Each unit is also divided the same way: four bars, then three, then two, etc. The first part of the piece (four units of 16 bars each) was termed \"exposition\" by Cage, and the ending (which is a separate nine-bar section) \"coda\". The music itself is built around sixteen motives employed in strictly determined sequences. Both the use of ethnic percussion and the rhythmic proportions technique were inspired in part by Henry Cowell's lectures that Cage attended in New York City in 1933.David Nicholls.

A summary of this point was provided by scholars writing for Journal of Business Research in 2020, Canavan Brendan and Claire McCamley when they concluded that \"she's probably the most successful female music artist ever in terms of her record sales, tour receipts, brand recognition and longevity\". British musicologist David Nicholls also suggested: \"Madonna became the most successful woman in music history by skillfully evoking, inflecting, and exploiting the tensions implicit in a variety of stereotypes and images of women\". In 2015, gender consultant and musicologist Laura Vi\u00f1uela taught in a course dedicated to Madonna at University of Oviedo that \"is the only woman who has such a long and massively successful career in the world of music\".
