He underachieved on that tour, a pattern attributed by coach Ian McGeechan and manager Geoff Cooke as at least partly due to his failing to secure the captaincy (this instead going to Gavin Hastings of Scotland) but also due in large part to the ascendency in the centre of both Guscott and Scott Gibbs of Wales. McGeechan and Cooke disclosed that Carling came close to voluntarily withdrawing from the squad; he did however recover his test place and played a notable role in the third test. McGeechan commented in his autobiography that Carling's failure to rise to the occasion as a Lion (in contrast to Guscott) may be seen by some as the difference between his legacy as a good player and a great player."]}, {"page": "Lawrence Dallaglio", "response": ["Dallaglio captained the Help for Heroes XV at a charity match in Twickenham.

On 6 December 1997, England drew 26\u201326 with New Zealand at Twickenham, after being heavily defeated (29\u201311) by South Africa at the same venue the week before and by New Zealand (25\u20138) in Manchester two weeks previously. In 1998, England toured Australia, New Zealand and South Africa; many of the experienced players were unavailable for what was to become nicknamed the \"Tour from Hell\" during which England lost all of their matches including a punishing 76\u20130 defeat by the Wallabies. In the last Five Nations match on 11 April 1999, with England poised to win the championship, Welsh centre Scott Gibbs sliced through six English tackles to score a try in the last minute, and the ensuing conversion by Neil Jenkins handed the final Five Nations title to Scotland."]}, {"page": "Richard Hill (rugby union, born 1973)", "response": ["On 11 May 2008, Hill played his final game for Saracens, who won 25\u201320 against Bristol.

Leeds Tykes were the Ospreys' first Heineken Cup opponents, with the English team triumphing 29\u201320 on 7 December 2003. They struggled to recover from their opening defeat, finishing bottom of their pool, recording their only victory against the Tykes' at home in the final round at St. Helens.

Harsh economic times in the eighties meant that players such as Jonathan Davies and Scott Gibbs were tempted to 'go North' to play professional rugby league in order to earn a living."]}]}}
