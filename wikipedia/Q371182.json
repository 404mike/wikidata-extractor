Newmark himself acknowledged  Ambraseys' contribution to this method through \"... the comments and suggestions... of his colleague for several months, while he was visiting the University of Illinois...\". Moreover, Harry Bolton Seed, the founding father of the diverse academic field geotechnical earthquake engineering, in the 19th Rankine Lecture acknowledged the influence of Ambraseys, \"... who introduced him to the problems of earthquakes and encouraged him to become involved in this new area pointing out the enormous field laboratory that existed in California...\" Ambraseys' early work  on the seismic stability of earth dams set the foundations of a new method of analysis which was later further developed by other researchers, the \"shear beam\" method; which was an early attempt to consider the dynamic behavior of an earth dam due to seismic wave propagation."]}]}}
