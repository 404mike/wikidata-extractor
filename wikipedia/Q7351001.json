His compositions include 'The High Level Bridge', 'The Great Exhibition', 'The Beeswing', 'The Hawk' and many others. Many other fine tunes have been attributed to him, but these include some he cannot possibly have written. Another local composer, in the later 19th century, was the fiddler and dancing master Robert Whinham, some 60 of whose compositions survive, notably the hornpipe 'Remember Me', and 'Whinham's Reel'."]}, {"page": "Robert Whinham (fiddler)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Whinham"]}, {"page": "Whinham", "response": ["*Robert Whinham (1814\u20131893), English fiddler"]}, {"page": "Carrycoats", "response": ["\"Carrycoats Hall\" is also a tune composed by Northumbrian fiddler and composer Robert Whinham, known also as \"Remember Me\"."]}, {"page": "Whinham, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Whinham"]}]}}
