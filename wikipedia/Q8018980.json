He was closely associated with Prime Minister David Lloyd George serving as his private and press secretary and later as his Parliamentary Private Secretary. He was one of Lloyd George's go-betweens in the sale of honours for the Lloyd George Fund. In his dealings with the press he would certainly have been labelled a spin doctor if that phrase had had currency in the early twentieth century, indeed he has recently been described as \"the first of the modern spin doctors\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Sutherland", "response": ["William Sutherland may refer to:", "* William Sutherland of Roscommon (died 1715), Member of the Scottish Parliament", "* William Sutherland, 17th Earl of Sutherland (1708\u20131750), Scottish nobleman", "* William Sutherland (British Army officer), fought in the American Revolutionary War", "* William Sutherland (Northwest Territories politician) (1854\u20131930), general merchant and political figure in the Northwest Territories, Canada", "* William Sutherland (physicist) (1859\u20131911), Australian physicist", "* Sir William Sutherland (Liberal politician) (1880\u20131949), Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster", "* William Sutherland (Ontario politician) (1926/7\u20131998), city councillor in North York, Ontario", "* Sir William Sutherland (police officer) (born 1933), British police officer"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister", "response": ["| William Sutherland", "| William Sutherland"]}]}}
