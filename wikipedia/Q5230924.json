However, it was a short-lived success.  In the February 1974 general election, Austick lost by 4,335 votes to the new Conservative candidate Keith Hampson after seven months as an MP.\nAustick was never again elected an MP, but he also served as a district and county councillor in Yorkshire and was one time Chairman of the Liberal Candidates' Association. He later became Executive Chairman of the Electoral Reform Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liberal Party (UK)", "response": ["In local elections, Liverpool remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the elections to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973. On 26 July 1973, the party won two by-elections on the same day, in the Isle of Ely (with Clement Freud), and Ripon (with David Austick). In the February 1974 general election, the Conservative government of Edward Heath won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats. The Conservatives were unable to form a government due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland Sunningdale Agreement. The Liberals obtained 6.1 million votes, the most it would ever achieve, and now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the Home Office if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted it would only agree pending a clear government commitment to introducing proportional representation (PR) and a change of prime minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath's cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead, a minority Labour government was formed under Harold Wilson but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the October 1974 general election, the Liberals total vote slipped back slightly (and declined in each of the next three) and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority."]}, {"page": "February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*David Austick (Ripon)"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: A", "response": ["*David Austick, Ripon, 1973\u201374"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*David Austick, Liberal MP 1973\u201374."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|David Austick"]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["* David Austick, Ripon, 1973\u201374"]}, {"page": "Ripon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| David Austick"]}, {"page": "1973 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 26 July \u2013 Parliamentary by-elections at the Isle of Ely and Ripon resulted in both seats being gained from the Conservatives by the Liberal Party candidates, media personality Clement Freud and David Austick respectively."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom by-election records", "response": ["|David Austick"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Stoddart-Scott", "response": ["The by-election following his death was won by the Liberal Party candidate, David Austick."]}, {"page": "1973 Ripon by-election", "response": ["1.
