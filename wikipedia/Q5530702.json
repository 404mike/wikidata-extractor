From Sophie Ingle's corner kick, her high delivery was met at the far post by Gemma Bonner, who prodded home from a yard out to give Chelsea the advantage. From Danielle Buet's delivery, Bonner flicked onto Susi, who was not to be denied, meeting the ball with a powerful header into the top corner to secure Chelsea's place in the final four with a 2-0 win.", "Helen Lander put Chelsea ahead in the 70th minute courtesy of a neat turn and finish and it looked for a long time that this solitary goal would be enough for glory, but Rachel Williams equalised in the 91st minute after Chelsea failed to clear a Karen Carney corner. The Londoners retook the lead in the first half of extra time through substitute Kate Longhurst, but the Blues bounced back once more when Carney converted a centrally-placed free-kick on the edge of the box. This goal forced the penalty shoot-out which they would eventually triumph in. Williams saw her kick saved by Carly Telford but Rachel Unitt, Jodie Taylor and Karen Carney all converted for the Midlanders. Chelsea's Drew Spence saw her penalty saved by Rebecca Spencer, Claire Rafferty hooked her penalty wide and Gemma Bonner blazed hers over the bar to hand The Cup to Birmingham.", "|CB ||5 || Gemma Bonner"]}, {"page": "2012 Chelsea L.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|5||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Gemma Bonner"]}, {"page": "2011 Chelsea L.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|5||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Gemma Bonner"]}, {"page": "Bonner (name)", "response": ["* Gemma Bonner (born 1991), English association football player"]}]}}
