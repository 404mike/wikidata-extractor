Roy's unsuccessful star-vehicle Happy Go Lucky also gave the first writing break to Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, who would soon team up with the show's last producer Dennis Main Wilson to create Hancock's Half Hour.Roy also hosted Variety Bandbox, a talent show that made known such performers as Michael Bentine, Frankie Howerd, Jimmy Edwards, Tony Hancock, Alfred Marks, Morecambe and Wise, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Graham Stark and Harry Worth.\nRoy was a resident of the large Art Deco apartment block, Du Cane Court in Balham, South London. A neighbour remembered: \"He was short, plump and wore glasses; and besides being a stand-up comedian, he featured on an amusing radio variety show. He was well liked, well known and very vulgar. He lived in B11 and had a large dog which he would take on stage as part of his act\".He appeared in the film, Dance With Me, alongside Anne Shelton and Max Wall.  In 1955, he also appeared on the first night of ITV.He died of cancer in March 1981 aged 58.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spike Milligan", "response": ["Milligan returned to jazz in the late 1940s and made a precarious living with the Hall trio and other musical comedy acts. He was also trying to break into the world of radio, as a performer or script writer. His first success in radio was as writer for comedian Derek Roy's show. After a delayed start, Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine joined forces in a relatively radical comedy project, The Goon Show. During its first season the BBC titled the show as Crazy People, or in full, The Junior Crazy Gang featuring those Crazy People, the Goons!, an attempt to make the programme palatable to BBC officials, by connecting it with the popular group of theatre comedians known as The Crazy Gang. p. 186."]}, {"page": "The Goon Show", "response": ["The group first formed at Jimmy Grafton's London public house called \"Grafton's\" in the late 1940s.There is some confusion in the literature about the actual name of the pub (e.g. Scudamore 1985, McCann 2006).

The Hancock connection began with their involvement with later radio variety series, and from November 1954 continued with Hancock's Half Hour on radio; a series featuring their scripts for Hancock ran on television between 1956 and 1961. In October that year Hancock ended his professional relationship with the writers, and with Beryl Vertue who worked with the writers' at their agency Associated London Scripts.

Subsequently, the pair wrote several comedy series for television, including Comedy Playhouse and  Steptoe and Son. The latter became the basis for the American series Sanford and Son and the Swedish series Albert & Herbert. Many of their works were re-adopted for later production, such as the Paul Merton revival of the Hancock's Half Hour for ITV, and the 2009 audio plays Galton and Simpson's Half Hour broadcast on BBC Radio 2 to celebrate the team's 60th anniversary."]}, {"page": "Roy", "response": ["*Derek Roy (born 1983), Canadian ice hockey player", "*Derek Roy (comedian) (1922\u20131981), English comedian"]}, {"page": "Denis Goodwin", "response": ["Goodwin and Monkhouse wrote scripts for comedians such as Derek Roy, Ted Ray and Arthur Askey.
