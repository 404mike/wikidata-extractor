Roy's unsuccessful star-vehicle Happy Go Lucky also gave the first writing break to Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, who would soon team up with the show's last producer Dennis Main Wilson to create Hancock's Half Hour.Roy also hosted Variety Bandbox, a talent show that made known such performers as Michael Bentine, Frankie Howerd, Jimmy Edwards, Tony Hancock, Alfred Marks, Morecambe and Wise, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Graham Stark and Harry Worth.\nRoy was a resident of the large Art Deco apartment block, Du Cane Court in Balham, South London. A neighbour remembered: \"He was short, plump and wore glasses; and besides being a stand-up comedian, he featured on an amusing radio variety show. He was well liked, well known and very vulgar. He lived in B11 and had a large dog which he would take on stage as part of his act\".He appeared in the film, Dance With Me, alongside Anne Shelton and Max Wall.  In 1955, he also appeared on the first night of ITV.He died of cancer in March 1981 aged 58.", "link_mentions": {}}}
