A heated exchange followed in which Forrest called Maloney a \"prevaricator\", \"scoundrel\", and a \"thing\", while Maloney repeatedly called on Forrest to deny his claims. Forrest subsequently told a reporter that Maloney had misrepresented a debate over the age of consent in which it was eventually agree to raise the age from 10 to 16. According to Forrest's biographer, \"what was extraordinary about the incident was that Maloney's interjection had nothing whatever to do with the subject then being discussed\". The issue was revived in 1909 when another Labor MP William Webster drew attention to the fact that the exchange had not been recorded by Hansard, apparently due to an agreement between Maloney, Forrest, Alfred Deakin, and Speaker Sir Frederick Holder. Maloney revived his accusations against Forrest in 1915."]}, {"page": "State Bank of South Australia", "response": ["The State Bank of South Australia was founded in 1896 as the outcome of an Act of Parliament, The Advances Bill, which provided for setting up of the Bank which could benefit the State's primary producers and other industries by providing loans guaranteed by the Government at preferential conditions.

He served as government whip before becoming Leader of the Opposition in 1899, when he had the Charles Kingston government dissolve over Kingston's proposal to extend suffrage to all householders and their wives.

He was equally successful in parliamentary debate; one of his colleagues called him the best debater in a house that contained Charles Kingston, Frederick Holder, John Cockburn, and John Jenkins."]}]}}
