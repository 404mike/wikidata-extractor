Page 111 to 113 After the shocking revelation, Nat and Georgia departed to start a new life in London and their father Ollie (Michael J. Jackson), who had been introduced ahead of the rest of the family as a friend of Mick Johnson's during 1995, threw their mother Bel (Lesley Nightingale) out after she had an extramarital fling with Mike Dixon, resulting in her catching a sexually-transmitted disease that she passed on to Ollie. Bel sought revenge by selling a story to the press falsely accusing Ollie of abusing Nat and Georgia as children, precipitating their incestuous relationship. The writers persevered with the remainder of the Simpson family, with Ollie meeting the Parade's new solicitor Eleanor Kitson (Georgia Reece), and she moved into number 9 with Ollie and Danny. Eleanor was found by her long-lost daughter Louise (Lisa Faulkner) and together they tracked down Louise's father, Marcus Sneddon. This storyline culminated in another hostage situation where Ollie, Eleanor, Louise and Danny are held at gunpoint by a deranged Marcus in a secluded hideaway, after which all four characters were abruptly written out and number 9 was sold to a returning Lindsey Corkhill."]}, {"page": "Bad Girls (TV series)", "response": ["* Helen Grace as Caroline Lewis (Series 3) "]}, {"page": "List of former Hollyoaks characters", "response": ["| Elizabeth Morrison || Helen Grace || 2012"]}, {"page": "List of Brookside characters", "response": ["|Georgia Simpson || Helen Grace||1996\u20131997"]}, {"page": "Roger Roger", "response": ["* Helen Grace as Chrissie (played by Lesley Vickerage in the pilot): Phil's girlfriend who wants him to settle down and be realistic about his chances of becoming a rock star.
