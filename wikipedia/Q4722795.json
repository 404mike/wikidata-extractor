He became known by the courtesy title Lord Harley on the death of his elder brother in 1828. In 1848 he succeeded his father in the earldom and the family seat at Brampton Bryan Hall in Herefordshire. Due to his mother's numerous love affairs, doubts were often raised about his paternity: he and his siblings were often called \"the Harleian Miscellany\".\nLord Oxford married Eliza Nugent (1806\u20131877), the illegitimate daughter of George Nugent, 1st Marquess of Westmeath, on 17 February 1831. Upon his death in January 1853, aged 44, the title became extinct. His estates passed to his sister Jane, who was married to Lord Langdale, from whom they eventually passed to a relative, William Daker Harley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer", "response": ["*Alfred Harley, 6th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (1809\u20131853)"]}, {"page": "Edward Harley, 5th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer", "response": ["*Alfred Harley, 6th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (10 January 1809 \u2013 19 January 1853)"]}, {"page": "Jane Harley, Countess of Oxford and Countess Mortimer", "response": ["*Alfred Harley, 6th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer."]}, {"page": "Alfred Harley, 6th Earl of Oxford and Mortimer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Harley, 6th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer"]}]}}
