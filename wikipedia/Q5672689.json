Burnley continued to play in the Second Division in the first decade of the 20th century; the side finished in last place in 1902\u201303 but were re-elected.Simpson (2007), p. 529 The struggling performances combined with the club's considerable financial debt saw manager Mangnall leave Burnley for Manchester United in October 1903; his successor was Spen Whittaker.Simpson (2007), p. 90 In 1907, Burnley supporter Harry Windle was invited onto the board to become a director and two years later, he was elected chairman. The club's finances improved under Windle's guidance.Simpson (2007), pp. 119, 186 The team reached the quarter-finals of the 1908\u201309 FA Cup but were eliminated by Mangnall's Manchester United in a replay. In the original match on the snow-covered pitch at Turf Moor, Burnley led 1\u20130 when the match was abandoned after 72 minutes.Simpson (2007), p. 112 In April 1910, Whittaker was on his way to London by overnight train to register the signing of Harry Swift from Accrington. During the journey, he fell from one of the carriages, and died from his injuries shortly afterwards. The directors appointed John Haworth as the new manager, who subsequently signed Burnley's first overseas player\u2014German Max Seeburg\u2014and changed the club's colours from green to the claret and blue of First Division champions Aston Villa; Haworth and the Burnley directors believed the change might improve the club's fortunes.Simpson (2007), pp. 540\u2013542 The side's form did improve; only a loss in the last game of the 1911\u201312 season denied the club promotion.Simpson (2007), pp. 123\u2013127"]}]}}
