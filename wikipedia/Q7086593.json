Kennard was also involved, at CSD, in the founding of the Protein Data Bank, and of the EMBL nucleotide sequence data library (later, European Nucleotide Archive).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crystallography", "response": ["Women have written many textbooks and research papers in the field of X-ray crystallography.
