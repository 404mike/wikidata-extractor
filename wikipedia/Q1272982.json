From 1940 until 1942 L\u00f6wenthal worked for the BBC\u2019s German language program, Sender der europ\u00e4ischen Revolution. In 1941, L\u00f6wenthal published a book which argued that it was necessary for the Soviet Union to be given the lion\u2019s share of the responsibility of governing Germany after the war, as this would be the best means of ensuring the triumph of the German Left. After 1943, L\u00f6wenthal disavowed this position and instead urged that the main responsibility of re-building Germany after the war be given to the Western powers, who were, in L\u00f6wenthal\u2019s opinion, the powers most likely to ensure a democratic Germany. L\u00f6wenthal very much admired the Labour Party and in several articles after 1945, urged that West Germany adopted the British model for its economic organization. In 1945, L\u00f6wenthal joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In his 1948 book, Jenseits des Kapitalismus, L\u00f6wenthal called for a Socialist reconstruction of the European system with an especially prominent role to be allocated to Great Britain as the most progressive of the European powers.Second Chance: Two Centuries Of German-speaking Jews in the United Kingdom edited by Werner E.

L\u00f6wenthal was late to write that \u201cIn England the German socialist emigrants got to know an impressive model of a free democracy which proved its worth under extreme external pressure; thus they were essentially confirmed in their democratic conviction and prepared for the task that awaited them after the war. The English, at least those who lent the emigrant an ear and cooperated with them, gathered new hope that a true democracy might be established in Germany and contributed considerably to the realization of this model during the first harsh postwar years. After a lapse of several decades, I can thus state with conviction that in spite of all the initial difficulties, the encounter proved rewarding to both sides\u201d.Second Chance: Two Centuries Of German-speaking Jews in the United Kingdom edited by Werner E.
