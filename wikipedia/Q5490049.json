E. Washbourn, on trials of her new armament. After workup, now under Captain R. Hutchins, Tiger went on a round of autumn flag-showing visits to Gdynia, Stockholm, Kiel and Antwerp. At the end of 1959 she deployed to the Mediterranean for a year as the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. By late 1960, there were still problems with her armament and it was planned to resolve these at her first refit at the end of 1960. During a visit by the Lord Carrington (the First Lord of the Admiralty), his Naval Secretary Rear-Admiral Frank Twiss \"made the unpardonable error of shooting down a very expensive target aircraft, to the cheers of the ship's company but to a stinging rebuke from their Lordships of the Admiralty.\"  The ship took part in operations in the Far East during the Indonesian Confrontation in the early 1960s.  The Navy in the early 1960s suffered manpower shortages, which resulted in a \"shortfall in technical personnel\" in the Tiger, as a consequence some \"items of its equipment could not be operated\", and \"some of its equipment was not operational\".  In September 1963, the Glasgow Herald said that the \"Tiger already has a much-reduced crew and is virtually a floating office.\" During the 1964 general election campaign, the leader of the opposition, Harold Wilson, criticised the government for this during a speech at Plymouth."]}, {"page": "Twiss", "response": ["* Sir Frank Twiss (1910\u20131994), Royal Navy admiral"]}, {"page": "Naval Secretary", "response": ["* 1960 \u2013 1962 Rear-Admiral Frank Twiss"]}, {"page": "Frank Roddam Twiss", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Twiss"]}, {"page": "Edward Twiss", "response": ["He served in the First World War attached to the Dorset Regiment and was cited for the Distinguished Service Order in June 1916, with promotion to the rank of major coming in the following month.
