He was the son of publisher Sir Stanley Unwin, of whom Severn wrote a biography in 1982, Fifty Years with Father. He had Who's Who entries throughout his writing career.\nSevern attended Abbotsholme School, Derbyshire, 1933\u201336, and worked for the League of Nations Secretariat, Geneva (1938), Unwin Brothers (printers), 1939, Blackwells (1940) and George Allen & Unwin (1941\u201343), having been declared medically unfit for the armed services.\nHis first series for children (1942\u201346) featured \"Crusoe\" Robinson, who was befriended by youngsters in holiday adventures, many featuring a Romany group. The Warner family series followed (1947\u201352), featuring pheasants, ponies and country life. The scraperboard illustrations of Joan Kiddell-Monroe greatly enhance these two series.\nA number of books experimented with the paranormal and time-slip, and can be compared with many modern books revisiting supernatural themes. Drumbeats! has a musical youngster beating a native drum which transports children to a lost expedition to Africa twenty years earlier. Dream Gold shows the hypnotic power of one boy over another, with dreams reliving the conflicts of their ancestors. These are his most interesting books, and the ones he wished to be remembered by. The Future Took Us is a time-slip into 3,000 C.E. The Girl in the Grove, his longest book, is a psychological ghost story. He also produced illustrated books for younger children.\nOnly his last three books were published by Allen & Unwin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*David Severn (1918\u20132010) \u2013 Ponies and Poachers, Dream Gold, The Future Took Us"]}, {"page": "1942 in literature", "response": ["*David Severn \u2013 Rick Afire"]}, {"page": "1918 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 3 December \u2013 David Severn, writer (died 2010)"]}, {"page": "Joan Kiddell-Monroe", "response": ["* David Severn, Waggon for Five (Bodley Head, 1944)", "* David Severn, Hermit in the Hills (Bodley Head, 1945)", "* David Severn, Forest Holiday (Bodley Head, 1946)", "* David Severn, Ponies and Poachers (Bodley Head, 1947)", "* David Severn, The Cruise of the Maiden Castle (Bodley Head, 1948)"]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**David Severn, writer (b. 1918)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2010", "response": ["*David Severn, 91, British author."]}, {"page": "Severn, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Severn"]}]}}
