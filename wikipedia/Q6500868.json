A new generation emerged, with the events attracting individuals from many disciplines such as field athletics, weightlifting and powerlifting. These competitions fed other international competitions such as Europe's Strongest Man and World's Strongest Man. Household names, such as Geoff Capes, Jamie Reeves and Gary Taylor dominated, with these three in particular going on to win World's Strongest Man titles. The modern era has seen this trend continue with Terry Hollands, Mark Felix and Laurence Shahlaei being regular faces at World's Strongest Man and its associated Super Series. Featured events in these contests have been tailored to emphasize a more well-rounded athlete, to reflect that viewpoint on strongman as a whole, and in the interests of increased popularity and marketability among the masses. Almost inevitably, more than one interested party has seen the benefits of strength competitions. Alternative organizations have formed in recent years, comprising a new wave of influence in the field, with the United Kingdom Strength Council (UKSC) founded by Britain's Strongest Man multi-year champion Glenn Ross setting up events separate from BSM, as has the IFSA. Ross and his UK Strongest Man competitions hold a philosophical difference in approach with the World's Strongest Man related venues, including more brute strength events similar to traditional strongman and powerlifting, with less emphasis on field athleticism and endurance.", "| Adam BishopMark FelixZake MuluziLaurence ShahlaeiLuke StoltmanTom Stoltman", "| Adam BishopMark FelixGraham HicksTerry HollandsLaurence ShahlaeiPaul SmithLuke Stoltman", "|  Laurence Shahlaei", "| Mark FelixEddie HallTerry HollandsLaurence ShahlaeiLuke StoltmanTom Stoltman", "| Adam BishopMark FelixCharlie GoughEddie HallTerry HollandsLaurence ShahlaeiLuke Stoltman", "| Adam BishopMark FelixEddie HallGraham HicksLaurence Shahlaei", "| Eddie HallGraham HicksBen KelseyTerry HollandsLaurence Shahlaei", "|  Laurence Shahlaei (2)", "| Mark FelixEddie HallGraham HicksTerry HollandsLloyd RenalsLaurence Shahlaei", "|  Laurence Shahlaei", "| Chris GearingEddie HallGraham HicksTerry HollandsJack McIntoshLaurence Shahlaei(injured - withdrew)", "| Mark FelixRob FramptonTerry HollandsJack McIntoshLaurence Shahlaei", "| Mark FelixTerry HollandsDarren SadlerLaurence ShahlaeiMark WestabyReserve: Rob Frampton", "| Laurence ShahlaeiTerry HollandsMark FelixJimmy MarkuDarren Sadler", "| Laurence ShahlaeiTerry HollandsMark FelixJimmy MarkuOli Thompson", "|2008 ||  Laurence Shahlaei & Rob Frampton ||  Paul Cater & Rich Gorvin ||   Dale Norris & Martin Jones ||", "|2009 ||  Laurence Shahlaei ||  Mark Westaby ||   Alex Culletto || Lichfield || Elite/UKSC"]}, {"page": "Arnold Strongman Classic", "response": ["| 7. || Laurence Shahlaei ||  || 22.5 || $5000"]}, {"page": "Strongman Champions League", "response": ["The Strongman Champions League is a strongman competition circuit, with several Grand Prix events throughout the year and the Strongman Champions League overall champion title going to the overall winner at the end of the season.
