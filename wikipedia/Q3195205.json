It is also possible that the material may first have been joined in with the collection in a copy made in Mercia .  Compared to the later texts, this pedigree gives an ancestry for Ceolwald as son of Cuthwulf son of Cuthwine which in the later 9th-century texts sometimes seems confused; and it states Cynric as son of Creoda son of Cerdic, whereas the Chronicle annals go to some length to present Cerdic and Cynric as a father-and-son pair who land in and conquer the southern part of Wessex together (a narrative now considered spurious by historians).Barbara Yorke (1989), \"The Jutes of Hampshire and Wight and the origins of Wessex\" in S.R.

Richard Newhauser has drawn attention to the subtlety of its analysis of its subject, \"alive to the difficulties of treating sin without becoming mired in sin itself, and aware of the ways in which sins constantly undo the borders between each other or disguise themselves as virtues\".  But for many critics the most interesting aspect of Handlyng Synne is its collection of exempla.  Comparison has been made with John Gower's Confessio Amantis: \"The octosyllabic couplets of Handlyng Synne may lack Gower's smoothness, but several of the tales, if cruder, are more vigorous and vivid than most of Gower's\".  Derek Pearsall called Mannyng \"a born story-teller\", who \"displays plenty of vigour, though his professional role allows little sophistication\".  Antony Gibbs wrote that \"his gusto conveys itself readily to his reader\".  Kenneth Sisam believed that \"in the art of linking good teaching with entertainment he is a master\", and called Handlyng Synne \"the best picture of English life before Langland and Chaucer\"."]}, {"page": "Unfer\u00f0", "response": ["Unferth's presence in the poem has been a point of much scholarly debate. He is called a \u00feyle or \u00f0yle \u2013 thyle (the word occurs only twice, once in line 1165 with \u00fe and then in line 1456 with \u00f0; it seems most scholarly articles use the \u00fe) \u2013 a term related to Old Norse thul, a court orator, reciter, or jester. It is noticed that Unferth's brief remarks against Beowulf's youthful risk-taking is \"a masterpiece of invective\" and yet there is no reprimand for it, which suggests that it may have been part of Unferth's duties or practices to make a visitor defend his reputation. James L. Rosier, relying on Latin glosses in other Old English writings, interpreted the word to suggest something villainous or scurrilous. This was, however, rejected by Ida M. Hollowell, who theorizes that the Anglo-Saxon audience who immediately know what a thyle was and would even identify Unferth as such by his position at the feet of the king, and it is someone innocuous or even worthy of respect. She refers to another suggestion for the meaning of thyle- a pagan priest, making Unferth a priest of Woden confronted by a presumably Christian Beowulf. J.D.A. Ogilvy similarly speculates that Unferth's post at the feet of the king demonstrate that he was some sort of entertainer, and that he may have been a landless exile as a result of the misadventures with his kinsmen and given refuge by Hrothgar, as had been done with Ecgtheow (lines 459\u2013472). Unferth only speaks once (an insult aimed at Beowulf), is described as intelligent and a kin-slayer, and is responsible for lending Beowulf his legendary, yet ill-fated sword, Hrunting. Kenneth Sisam argues that readers would be advised not to speculate beyond these basic facts as laid out by the poet. It should be kept in mind that, although the sword provided by Unferth was ineffective against Grendel's mother, we are told that this sword is an ancient treasure, \"never had it failed\" but although it had sliced through many a helmet, against Grendel's dam \"this was the first time that the glorious treasure failed\"; Unferth had no reason to foresee this failure, he gave his sword to Beowulf fully expecting it to be entirely successful. Another thought comes from Carroll Rich, who notes that the biblical tale of Cain and Abel is deeply woven into the poem, and as Unferth is a character who is notorious for slaying his own brother, a parallel might exist. Rich observes that \"the depiction of Unferth as an envious fratricide makes clear the threat he poses to Beowulf and to a society dependent upon mutual trust.\"  However, Norman E. Eliason suggests that the mention of Unferth's fratricide, although apparently reiterated in line 1167, is not to be taken seriously but is a mere bit of billingsgate.  Eliason's theory is that Unferth is an admirable character, well-intentioned, despite the narrator's suggestions to the contrary."]}, {"page": "Eduard Fraenkel", "response": ["Fraenkel had begun to show interest in the Agamemnon of Aeschylus as early as 1925 but focused on Latin literature in the years leading up to his application for the Corpus Professorship. He developed his thoughts on the play in his weekly seminars held from 1936 to 1942. From March 1942, a group of friends around the Latinist R. A. B. Mynors and the historian John Beazley began to support Fraenkel in the process of preparing his notes for publication. Parts of his work, including a translation of the Greek text, had to be translated from German into English. In 1943, Fraenkel submitted a manuscript for a commentary on the Agamemnon to Oxford University Press. Although Kenneth Sisam, the press's delegate, took a favourable view of it, the publication process was held up due to concerns about the manuscript's exceptional length, leading Sisam to describe the commentary as \"a Teutonic monster\".

The euhemerizing treatment of Woden as the common ancestor of the royal houses is presumably a \"late innovation\" within the genealogical tradition which developed in the wake of the Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons. Kenneth Sisam has argued that the Wessex pedigree was co-opted from that of Bernicia, and David Dumville has reached a similar conclusion with regard to that of Kent, deriving it from the pedigree of the kings of Deira.", "The Wessex royal pedigree continued to puzzle historians until, in 1953, Anglo-Saxon scholar Kenneth Sisam presented an analysis that has since been almost universally accepted by historians. He noted similarities between the earlier versions of the Wessex pedigree and that of Ida. Those appearing in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and in the published transcript of Asser (the original having been lost in an 18th-century fire) are in agreement, but several earlier manuscript transcripts of Asser's work give, instead, the shorter pedigree of the later Anglian collection manuscripts, probably representing the original text of Asser and the earliest form of the Cerdic pedigree.Sisam, pp. 300-305 Sisam speculated that the additional names arose through the insertion of a pair of Saxon heroes, Freawine and Wig, into the existing pedigree, creating a second alliterative pair (after Brand/B\u00e6ld\u00e6g, Giwis/Wig, where the stress of \"Giwis\" is on the second syllable) and inviting further alliteration, the addition of Esla to complete an Elesa/Esla pair, and of Fri\u00f0gar to make a Freawine/Fri\u00f0gar alliteration.Sisam, pp. 304-307 Of these alliterative names (in a culture whose poetry depended upon alliteration rather than rhyme) only Esla is perhaps known elsewhere: British historians working before Sisam suggested that his name is that of Ansila, a legendary Goth ancestor or that he is Osla 'Bigknife' of Arthurian legend,Alfred Anscombe, \"The Date of the First Settlement of the Saxons in Britain: II.
