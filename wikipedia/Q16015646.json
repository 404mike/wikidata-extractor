He was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex and died in Nottingham. He appeared in 87 first-class matches as a righthanded batsman who bowled right arm medium pace. He scored 3,145 runs with a highest score of 102 and took one wickets with a best performance of one for 18.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Warwickshire, let down by unreliable batting, were captained by attacking batsman Peter Cranmer. Despite their lack of success, they attracted large crowds to Edgbaston. Their best players were Test spinner Eric Hollies and batsman Tom Dollery, who was to become captain as a professional in 1948, though Dollery had a relatively poor season in 1947. Warwickshire were well served by their bowlers. In addition to Hollies, these were three new caps in the two seamers Victor Cannings and Charles Grove; and the New Zealand pace bowler Tom Pritchard. Dollery had to play as wicketkeeper in several matches when Cyril Goodway was unavailable. Playfair commented on advantages gained by the bowlers being \"squandered\" by inconsistent and unreliable batsmen. Five batsmen did exceed 1,000 runs but none had a good average: Cranmer, Dollery, Aubrey Hill, Jimmy Ord and Ken Taylor. Other players were Bill Fantham, John Hossell and Ron Maudsley.Playfair, pp. 108\u2013109. Warwickshire played eleven home matches at their Edgbaston headquarters in Birmingham and two matches at the Courtaulds Ground in Coventry."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Taylor", "response": ["Kenneth, Kenny or Ken Taylor may refer to:", "*Ken Taylor (cricketer, born 1916) (1916\u20132002), English cricketer", "*Ken Taylor (cricketer, born 1935), English cricketer and footballer for Huddersfield Town", "*Ken Taylor (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1953), New Zealand cricketer", "*Ken Taylor (footballer, born 1931) (1931\u20132016), English footballer for Blackburn Rovers", "*Ken Taylor (footballer, born 1936), footballer for Manchester City", "*Ken Taylor (American football) (born 1963), Chicago Bears defensive back", "*Ken Taylor (poet), Australian poet, see New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards", "*Ken Taylor (politician), Canadian politician and former leader of the Yukon Liberal Party", "*Ken Taylor (rugby union) (born 1957), New Zealand rugby union player", "*Ken Taylor (bass player), bass guitar player with Peter Maffay", "*Ken Taylor (motor racing engineer), partner in Thomson & Taylor", "*Ken Taylor (scriptwriter) (1922\u20132011), television script writer best known for his adaptation of The Jewel in the Crown", "*A rosemary cultivar, Rosmarinus officinalis \u2018Ken Taylor\u2019 "]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Ken Taylor (1946\u20131949) : K.
