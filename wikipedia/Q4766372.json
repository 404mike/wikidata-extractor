She joined D'Oyly Carte in 1933, but was considered by the company's management as too tall to be an ideal performer of the Savoy Operas' young soprano heroines, and left the company in 1938. During World War II she toured in a variety of theatrical shows. She married the D'Oyly Carte musical director, Isidore Godfrey, in 1940, and returned to the company in 1950 as a contralto, playing Gilbert's formidable older women, until shortly before her death at the age of 54.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Ruth||Ella Halman||Ann Drummond-Grant||Christene Palmer||Lyndsie Holland||Patricia Leonard"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Katisha||Ann Drummond-Grant||Christene Palmer||Lyndsie Holland||Patricia Leonard"]}, {"page": "Iolanthe", "response": ["|Celia||Ethel Armit||Hilary Davies||Ann Drummond-Grant||Ana Nicholson||Enid Walsh", "|Fairy Queen||Ann Drummond-Grant||Christene Palmer||Lyndsie Holland||Patricia Leonard"]}, {"page": "Ruddigore", "response": ["|Dame Hannah||Ella Halman||Ann Drummond-Grant||Christene Palmer||Lyndsie Holland||Patricia Leonard"]}, {"page": "H.M.S.
