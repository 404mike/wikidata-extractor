He appeared in 63 films between 1918 and 1945, most often with his older brother, Lupino Lane. He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and died in Ashford, Kent, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lupino Lane", "response": ["Lane was born Henry William George Lupino, in Hackney, London, son of Harry Charles Lupino (1867\u20131925), part of the Lupino family. He adopted the surname Lane from his great-aunt Sarah Lane (1822\u20131899, n\u00e9e Borrow), the director of the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton. Lane married actress Violet Blythe on 10 February 1917, and their son was the actor Lauri Lupino Lane (1921\u201386). Lane's brother was the actor Wallace Lupino, and his nephew, Wallace's son, was another actor, Richard Lupino.", "Lane's silent film career started in 1915 in a series of British short films, including the experimental Mr Butterbuns series. As a comedy actor, he appeared in 40 Hollywood films made in the 1920s.  After several shorts and features for Fox in 1922\u201323, Lane appeared as Rudolph in D. W. Griffith's 1924 feature Isn't Life Wonderful?. He signed with Educational Pictures for a series of short comedies that featured his acrobatic flips and falls. Roscoe Arbuckle was one of his directors, but Lane was soon directing the films himself under the pseudonym \"Henry W. George\" (his given names). These comedies displayed Lane's agility and versatility: in one film he played 27 characters (Only Me, 1929). Lane's brother Wallace Lupino, who usually co-starred in Lane's comedies, also starred in his own comedies, of which only three are known to survive.
