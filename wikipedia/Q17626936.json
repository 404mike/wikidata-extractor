In cricket he had success as a bowler and his batting figures are not impressive by modern standards; in a few matches, however, he opened the batting. It is not known if he batted or bowled right- or left-handed. He played in several of Cambridge University's first-class games in the 1844, 1845 and 1846 seasons, appearing in the University Match against Oxford University each year, and reappeared in 1847 for a fourth University Match, though that was his only game of that season. He twice took six wickets in an innings, though the full scorecards for most of his games are not available. In his final University Match of 1847, his last game of first-class cricket, he shared all 20 Oxford wickets with John Lee, each taking 10 in the match."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1827\u20131863)", "response": ["* John Lee (1847) : J.
