The application to build the stadium was submitted to South Gloucestershire Council on 9 March 2012.", "Doubts were raised about the stadium again in August 2014 after it emerged that Rovers had issued a writ against Sainsbury's, alleging that the supermarket chain was attempting to terminate its contract to buy the Memorial Stadium site. At a six-day High Court hearing in May 2015, Sainsbury's argued it had \"lawfully terminated\" the contract when planning conditions were not met before the \"cut-off date\" in the agreement. On 13 July 2015, Mrs Justice Proudman ruled in favour of Sainsbury's saying the way the deal was structured was an \"insuperable barrier to the club\". Rovers chairman Nick Higgs described it as a \"huge disappointment\" and stated \"We will be asking them [UWE] to hang in there with us as it\u2019s not over yet. We have looked at a number of other options to still bring this new stadium to fruition, even without the help of Sainsbury\u2019s, and we will continue to do that. We have an obligation to explore options and it would be remiss of us not to do so for the sake of the fans, and for this club\". The club were granted leave to appeal later the same month and confirmed Sainsbury's had made an out of court cash offer to end the litigation, which was rejected being described as 'derisory'. The appeal, held in January 2016, saw the club's lawyers claim Mrs Justice Proudman made a \"fundamental error\" in agreeing with the supermarket chain. The verdict from the two-day appeal came on 17 March 2016 and upheld the high court decision.", "A further twist to the tale came in February 2016 when Bristol Rovers were purchased by the wealthy Al-Qadi family of Jordan, rending the outcome of the court case \"no longer relevant\" as described by former chairman Nick Higgs."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Football League Two", "response": ["|Nick Higgs"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Football League Two", "response": ["|  Nick Higgs"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["*  \u2013 Rovers were acquired by the Jordanian Al-Qadi family, founders of the Arab Jordan Investment Bank, taking a 92% shareholding in the club.
