Stearn", "response": ["While working at the bookshop he made many friends among the Cambridge botanists and participated in their activities, including botanical excursions. In addition to Professor Seward, those influencing him included the morphologist Agnes Arber, Humphrey Gilbert-Carter the first scientific director of the Botanic Garden, John Gilmour then curator of the university herbarium and later director of the Garden (1951\u20131973), the horticulturalist E. A. Bowles (1865\u20131954), who became his patron, Harry Godwin, then a research fellow and later professor and Tom Tutin who was working with Seward at that time. Seward gave him full research facilities in the herbarium. He continued his research, visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in 1930, at the age of 19, and also spent two weeks at the herbarium of the Mus\u00e9e National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, with the aid of a \u00a315 grant from the Royal Society to study Epimedium. Also in 1930, the Fifth International Botanical Congress was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend. During this time he commuted between the bookshop, the Botany School, Botanic Garden and home by bicycle, his preferred means of transportation throughout his life.", "In 1933, H. R. Hutchinson, who was the Librarian at the Lindley Library, Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) in London, was due to retire. John Gilmour, now assistant director at the Kew Gardens, put forward Stearn's name, together with Bowles, a vice-president of the Society, who had discovered Stearn at the bookshop. Stearn was 22 when he began work at the library, initially as assistant librarian, before taking over Hutchinson's position after six months. He later explained his appointment at such a young age as being the result of World War I: \"All the people who should have had those jobs were dead.\" There he collaborated with Bowles on a number of plant monographs, such as Bowles' Handbook of Crocus and their work on Anemone japonica (Anemone hupehensis var. japonica). Written in 1947, it is still considered one of the most comprehensive accounts of the origins and nomenclature of fall-blooming anemones. Stearn was one of the last people to see Bowles alive, and when Bowles died, Stearn wrote an appreciation of him, and later contributed the entry on Bowles to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Much of his spare time was spent studying at the Kew Gardens.", "Motivated by his interest in botanical history and taxonomy, Stearn devoted a considerable part of his output to botanical bibliography, including numerous papers and catalogues establishing the exact publication dates of books on natural history, particularly from the early nineteenth century, including William Herbert's work on Amaryllidaceae (1821, 1837) and complete bibliographies of botanists such as John Gilmour (1989). At the RHS library he transformed the minimalist card indexing by introducing British Museum rules and adding extensive bibliographic information. He quickly realised that one of the major deficits in contemporary taxonomic nomenclature was a lack of precise dates of all the names, and set about rectifying this over a fifteen-year period, resulting in 86 publications, which was a major step in stabilising nomenclature. The importance of this lay in the rules of botanical nomenclature, which gives botanical names priority based on dates of publication. He considered his most important contribution in this regard to be his elucidation of the dating of the early 19th century collection of studies of Canary Islands flora by Webb and Berthelot (1836\u20131850). Another important work from this period was on Ventenat's Jardin de la Malmaison (1803\u20131804), also published in the new Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History. In a number of instances his contributions to others' work went unacknowledged, particularly when he was younger, even though his introductions (often with the title \"Revised and enlarged by W. T. Stearn\") could be as lengthy as the texts they preceded. His contributions to botanical bibliography and in particular the correct interpretation of historical texts from Linnaeus to Arber are considered of central importance to the field of taxonomy."]}, {"page": "John Gilmour", "response": ["John Gilmour may refer to:", "* Sir John Gilmour of Craigmillar (16051671), Scottish judge, Lord President of the Court of Session 16611671 ", "* Sir John Gilmour, 1st Baronet (18451920), Scottish Unionist politician", "* Sir John Gilmour, 2nd Baronet (18761940), Scottish Unionist politician, Home Secretary, Secretary of State for Scotland", "* John Gilmour (footballer) (19011963), Scottish footballer (Dundee FC and Scotland)", "* John Gilmour (botanist) (19061986), British botanist", "* Sir John Gilmour, 3rd Baronet (19122007), Scottish Conservative Party politician, Member of Parliament for East Fife 19611979", "* Sir John Gilmour, 4th Baronet (19442013), Scottish nobleman", "* John Gilmour (ice hockey), (born 1993)", "* John Gilmour (cartoonist) (1892\u20131951), New Zealand cartoonist"]}, {"page": "John Scott Lennox Gilmour", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Gilmour (botanist)"]}, {"page": "J.S.L.
