He was awarded the International Master title in 1980. He is a prolific writer, who has made many contributions to the field of chess openings, and is particularly known for frequently choosing bizarre or rarely played openings in his own games, including the St. George Defence (with which English Grandmaster Tony Miles once famously defeated the then World Champion Anatoly Karpov), the Grob (for Black and White) and also The Creepy Crawly, which is a3, then h3 followed by a quick c4. Possibly his greatest tournament success was when tying for first place in the British Chess Championship tournament of 1973, although he was to lose the play-off match with William Hartston.\nIn 1975 England contested a match over ten boards against France in Luton. Basman played Board One, ahead of future super Grandmasters John Nunn and Jon Speelman.\nHe created the UK Chess Challenge, a tournament for juniors of all standards and ages progressing over four stages. Grandmaster Raymond Keene once wrote, referring to Basman's promotion of youth chess, \"Michael Basman is in many ways the most important person in British chess.\"Basman's father was an Armenian immigrant who changed the family name from Basmadjian. His family knew the singer Cleo Laine, who worked as a babysitter for the young Michael.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chess players", "response": ["* Michael Basman (England, born 1946)"]}, {"page": "Tony Miles", "response": ["In 1980 at the European Team Championship in Skara, he beat reigning World Champion Anatoly Karpov with Black, using the extremely unorthodox opening 1. e4 a6!?, the St. George Defence. It is often said that Miles learned the line from offbeat openings enthusiast Michael Basman, but in his book Play the St. George, Basman asserts there is no truth to this. Miles beat Karpov again three years later in Bath in a game that was part of the BBC's Master Game series, but it was shown only by the (co-producing) German television network, due to a BBC technicians' strike at the time of broadcast."]}, {"page": "Fianchetto", "response": ["Black's queen bishop is also fianchettoed, but the knight pawn has moved forward two squares, making this a long fianchetto. The b-pawn also controls the c4-square, which is often advantageous. If White plays the King's Indian Attack 1.Nf3 2.g3, Black may play a long queen's fianchetto to oppose White's bishop and make it more difficult for White to play a c4 . A long fianchetto on the kingside is more rarely played, because it weakens the pawn shield in front of the castled position and controls a less important square. Nevertheless, Grob's Attack 1.g4 and the Borg Defence (\"Grob\" backwards) 1.e4 g5 are sometimes played by players such as IM Michael Basman."]}, {"page": "Grob's Attack", "response": ["The Grob is generally considered inferior and is rarely employed in serious competition.

It has a certain surprise value, and the average player is unlikely to know how to refute it and more likely to get overconfident and make mistakes. Moreover, the lack of theory along this line may negate the repertoire of an experienced opponent. Intuitive play by  Black can lead into dangerous traps.  Many of these traps rely on Black's replying with 1...d5, attacking the pawn with his .

It also leads to a slight weakening of White's kingside, albeit not as severely as Grob's Attack (1.g4) or Barnes Opening (1.f3). Since there is no need for White to make such a time-wasting first move, it is among the rarest of the 20 possible first moves. Nevertheless, IM Michael Basman has experimented with 1.h3, usually following it up with 2.g4 (transposing to the Grob), or 2.a3 followed by a quick c4, a line that has been dubbed the \"Creepy Crawly\".
