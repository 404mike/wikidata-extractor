With the U's into the third round, it would be the club that inspired Colchester's own strip, Huddersfield Town of the First Division, that would taste defeat at the hands of the non\u2013Leaguers. With the national press making Colchester's Cup progress headline news, Fenton welcomed the extra publicity. He watched Huddersfield play a number of times prior to the tie, declaring to the media that he had come up with a plan to beat them. The plan became known as \"the F\u2013plan\". Both teams changed colours for the game, with visiting Huddersfield in red, and Colchester in blue. The First Division side struggled to adapt to the cramped surroundings of Layer Road, and when Bob Allen's free kick was parried away by the goalkeeper, U's captain Bob Curry scored from the rebound. This was the first time that a non\u2013League side had beaten a First Division club, with a record crowd of 16,005 witnessing that game.", "|Bob Allen||WG||||Bromley-by-Bow||||0||0|| Gainsborough Trinity||13 June 1946||Free transfer", "|Bob Allen", "|Bob Allen"]}, {"page": "Albert Robert Allen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Allen (footballer, born 1916)"]}, {"page": "1938\u201339 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["| Bob Allen", "| Bob Allen"]}, {"page": "1944\u201345 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Bob Allen"]}, {"page": "1945\u201346 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Bob Allen", "|5||MF||||Bob Allen||2||2||0||4"]}]}}
