In 1752 it passed to a relative, Alexander Hay of Mordington (died 1788), Advocate. Thereafter it passed to the Renton (later Campbell-Renton) of Lamberton family who retained possession until the 1970s, when, having failed in the male line, the family ended with a female inheritor who preferred to reside in Edinburgh. The House and Estate was then purchased by the Trotter family of Charterhall and Mortonhall in the late 1980s. It is still under their ownership today."]}]}}
