He was born in Rawmarsh, Yorkshire.\nAppleyard began his career with Rotherham Forge, subsequently playing for Rotherham Town and Rawmarsh Athletic before joining Barnsley where he made his league debut in the 1923\u201324 season. He joined Exeter City in 1924 before moving to local rivals Torquay United where he was a regular in their Southern League side in the 1925\u201326 season. He also played in all eight of Torquay's FA Cup games that season as they reached the first round and took Third Division Reading to a second replay.\nHe left at the end of the 1925\u201326 season to join Wrexham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Torquay United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|rowspan=2 align=left|George Appleyard||rowspan=2|29"]}, {"page": "Appleyard", "response": ["* George Appleyard, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["Much of the Torquay's success during the season was due to the goalscoring of new forward George Appleyard, signed from local rivals Exeter City.  Effortlessly filling the boots of the recently departed Billy Kellock, Appleyard scored an impressive 29 goals in all competitions.  He made a particular impression in the FA Cup, scoring in all five Qualifying rounds and getting Torquay to the First Round Proper for the very first time.  Their reward was a visit from high-flying Third Division South side Reading.  6,000 supporters at Plainmoor witnessed Torquay take a first half lead over their League opponents before Reading equalised through a penalty which forced a replay at Elm Park.  A late equalising goal from George Appleyard in that match saw the fixture taken to a second replay, to be held at Bristol City's Ashton Gate ground.  However, it was to be third time unlucky for the Magpies as the League side eventually emerged with a 2\u20130 victory."]}, {"page": "Appleyard, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Appleyard"]}]}}
