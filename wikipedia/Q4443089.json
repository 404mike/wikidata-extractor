Previously he had qualified for the World Championship in 2001, but lost 10\u20139 to Joe Swail after leading 9\u20137. His best season was 2002/03 when he won 28 matches overall - the most out of anyone on the tour. He suffered a drop in form in the following season, winning just three matches (although he was now entering tournaments at a later stage). Having been provisionally as high as #26 during the 2003/2004 season, he ended up at #50, and dropped to #68 a year later.\nHis best ranking break to date was a 145 in the 2001 British Open. In 1997, Storey became the first cueist to compile two maximum breaks in the same pro-am tournament.
