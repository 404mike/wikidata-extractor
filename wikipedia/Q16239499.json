He is a descendant of Football League players George Heppell and Albert Pearson.\nConlon began his career in the youth set-up at Stoke City, later joining the youth academies at Newcastle Town and Peterborough United respectively. He made a handful of appearances in the first-team at Peterborough, before signing for Stevenage on loan in September 2014, a deal that was subsequently made permanent in January 2015. He signed with Port Vale in July 2018, was appointed club captain in January 2021 and named Player of the Year at the end of the 2020\u201321 season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Conlon", "response": ["* Tom Conlon (born 1996), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Luke Joyce", "response": ["On 17 May 2018, Joyce signed a two-year contract with League Two side Port Vale; manager Neil Aspin said that \"he is comfortable in possession and was impressive against us for Carlisle\". He chose to join the \"Valiants\" despite receiving a better contract offer from a club playing below the English Football League. He started the 2018\u201319 season in a central midfield partnership with Manny Oyeleke. However he lost his place to Tom Conlon after Conlon returned to fitness in September, and Joyce went on to admit that \"I have not quite performed as well as I would like to and had the influence on games\". He continued in indifferent form for the rest of Aspin's tenure and was given permission to look for a new club in January after going seven games without a first-team appearance, though started against Lincoln City on New Year's Day and remained in the first-team thereafter. He became a key player under new manager John Askey in February and ended the season with 35 starts and seven substitute appearances.", "On 18 September 2019, he marked his 500th appearance in a Football League fixture as Vale lost 2\u20130 at league leaders Exeter City; he quipped that \"that probably sums up my career really, Exeter away on a Tuesday night\". He scored his first goal for the club on 5 October, levelling the scores in what finished as a 3\u20131 win over Morecambe at Vale Park. In February 2020, it was announced that Joyce had triggered a clause in his contract to keep him at the club until summer 2021. He scored one goal in 43 appearances throughout the 2019\u201320 season, missing just one league game due to suspension, providing the defensive cover in the holding midfield role to allow players such as Scott Burgess, Jake Taylor and Tom Conlon to get further forward.

The team had an indifferent start to the season, with the highlight being a 1\u20130 victory at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 22 September. Having seen their team pick up just seven points from an available 27 in November and December, a section of travelling supporters booed and heckled Aspin during a 1\u20131 draw at Lincoln City on New Year's Day; Aspin reacted badly to the fan's \"lack of respect\" towards him and considered quitting his role, but said that he decided to stay because he had the support of the players and chairman Norman Smurthwaite. However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch.

He was up to match fitness after having spent a full pre-season training with Doncaster Rovers. He made his \"second debut\" for the club the following day, playing at right-back in a 3\u20131 home win over Morecambe, and in doing so set a club record for the longest time between appearances as his previous game for the club came 11 years and 11 months earlier.
