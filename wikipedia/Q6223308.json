In September, four of the five directors resigned, one of them (Len Cliff) stated that \"the club is being run by outsiders\". A new board was formed by November. Meanwhile, on 13 September the club suffered a loss of 7\u20133 at Gay Meadow to Shrewsbury Town, despite a Bobby Gough hat-trick \u2013 the match also saw a sending off, an attempted pitch invasion, and a \u00a335 fine for Gordon Lee for remarks he made to referee Ricky Nicholson. Tommy McLaren then returned from injury to lead Vale on a four match winning streak that included a 2\u20130 win over fallen-giants Aston Villa in front of a Burslem crowd of 11,224 fans. Four straight defeats soon came after this sequence however, as Vale's form was patchy. In December, Ron Wilson left the club as he emigrated to South Africa due to his son's ill health. A 1\u20130 defeat at Villa Park on 16 January was the first of a nine match streak without a victory. At the end of the month Lee signed John Brodie from Northern Premier League side Bradford Park Avenue for \u00a3250. During this spell forward Sammy Morgan began to be jeered by fans after losing his scoring touch. He also began studying to be a teacher. Lee said that \"I really feel some of our lads have been singled out by the boo boys. If only they realised that encouragement can lift players, things would be so much better\". In February, Mark Singer resigned as chairman, and was replaced by Graham Bourne.

In September, Sproson made a \u00a310,000 bid for Keith Leonard that was rejected.

The \"Valiants\" proved difficult to beat, and heading into Christmas they won six of their last nine league games. Their 4\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town lifted them into third place, though attendances were still below 4,000. A 3\u20131 win over Southend United at Roots Hall then put the club into second spot, at which point Bob Mountford was sold to Rochdale for \u00a32,000. A four-day holiday in Benidorm in the new year did not seem to help the Vale, as three straight defeats followed to drag them down the table. To halt the slide Sproson bought striker Derek Brownbill from Liverpool for \u00a35,000. Two sendings off in a 3\u20131 defeat at Leeds Road \u2013 John Brodie also managed to break his leg in the challenge that earned him a red card \u2013 forced Sproson to defend his team after that took the Vale's red card tally to seven for the season.

Six games without a win soon brought the \"Valiants\" tumbling down the table though, as Cullerton lost his scoring touch. At the end of October arrived Steve Taylor on loan from Bolton Wanderers, who put more 'bite' into the Vale attack. Home fans turned against the players, and coach Reg Berks was 'appalled by some of the abuse hurled at the players'. Taylor scored a brace past Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on 8 November, only to return immediately back to Bolton. The team's poor disciplinary record continued from the previous campaigns, and The Football Association put the club 'under constant review' after Sproson arrived 45 minutes late to a disciplinary hearing in London after missing his train. Cullerton was back in scoring form as the Vale picked up victories and rose up the table. A season-low crowd of 2,789 on 20 December saw Vale come from 3\u20130 down to Grimsby Town to win the match 4\u20133. To motivate the players coach Reg Berks had told them at half-time that he was facing the sack if the team lost the game. The promotion-chasers pulled away from Vale in the New Year however. A rare event occurred on 17 January, when the Vale directors permitted rivals Stoke to play a home game to Middlesbrough at Vale Park. This happened because a severe gale severely damaged the Victoria Ground, whilst the gale also caused \u00a32,000 worth of damage to Vale Park, the damage to Stoke's ground was much more severe. A crowd of 21,009 saw Stoke win 1\u20130, the highest crowd at Vale Park in over a decade. Vale's campaign carried on, though injuries built up Ray Williams managed to break a 21-game goal drought to earn a credible point at Cardiff City's Ninian Park on 25 February. Eight more points in the next four games took the club to within three points of the promotion zone. Yet in March the club sold Brian Horton to Brighton & Hove Albion for \u00a330,000, a sum the club needed to balance the books. The club's form suffered immediately, and mid-table was the result.

In their places were new signings Alan Lamb (\u00a35,000 from Preston North End) and Peter Sutcliffe (\u00a33,000 from Stockport County), whilst a fit again Cullerton was like a new signing. The club had drifted into the bottom four, but a six match unbeaten run with a prolific Cullerton took them to safety. In the background was an ongoing power struggle in the boardroom. In late-March they then received a 6\u20132 beating at Wrexham and then a 4\u20130 beating from Chesterfield at Saltergate. The club suffered an injury crisis in April, with both Keith Chadwick and John Brodie having been forced to retire through injury. Relegation was avoided however with six points from the final five games. The final game of the season was against Rotherham United, who needed a six-goal win margin to gain promotion.
