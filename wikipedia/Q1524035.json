His argument says that had Antigone not been so obsessed with the idea of keeping her brother covered, none of the deaths of the play would have happened. This argument states that if nothing had happened, nothing would have happened, and doesn't take much of a stand in explaining why Antigone returned for the second burial when the first would have fulfilled her religious obligation, regardless of how stubborn she was. This leaves that she acted only in passionate defiance of Creon and respect to her brother's earthly vessel."]}, {"page": "Kathleen Freeman (classicist)", "response": ["Freeman attended the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff, which accepted female and male students by the charter granted in 1893.
