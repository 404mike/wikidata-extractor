Adrian Jack of London's Independent describes one of Kenner's recitals as \"...the best performance I have ever heard in the concert hall of all four of Chopin's Ballades\". The Financial Times in London described Kenner as a \"player of grace, subtle variety and strength, with a mature grasp of dramatic structure and proportion: in short, a grown-up musician nearing his peak.\"  And the Washington Post recently proclaimed him \"a major talent ... an artist whose intellect, imagination and pianism speak powerfully and eloquently.\"  The conductor Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, who recorded with pianists such as Arthur Rubinstein, claimed Kenner's Chopin interpretations to be the most sensitive and beautiful he remembered."]}, {"page": "Jack (surname)", "response": ["*Adrian Jack (born 1943), British composer"]}]}}
