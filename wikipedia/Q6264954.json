In August 1800 Windham invited Cobbett to dinner, where he met the Prime Minister, William Pitt, and contributors to the Anti-Jacobin, including George Canning.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 183.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 70. Pitt's government offered Cobbett the editorship of a government newspaper, but he chose to remain independent.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 184\u2013185.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 70\u201372. His own paper, The Porcupine, bearing the motto \"Fear God, Honour the King\", started up on 30 October 1800, but without success, and he sold his interest in it in 1801. Less than a month later, however, he started the Political Register, a weekly newspaper that appeared almost every week from January 1802 until 1835, the year of Cobbett's death. Windham and French Laurence had suggested the idea of a weekly newspaper to Cobbett and Windham raised the money to fund it by private subscription.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 207."]}, {"page": "John Wright", "response": ["John Wright may refer to:", "*John Wright (pianist) (1934\u20132017), jazz pianist", "*John Wright (film editor) (active since 1978), American film editor ", "*John Wright (musician) (born 1962), Canadian drummer", "*John Wright (poet) (1805\u20131843), Scottish poet", "*John Wright (1568\u20131605), member of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot", "*John Wright (Tasmanian politician) (1892\u20131947), Australian politician", "*John Wright (Missouri politician) (born 1976), American politician", "*John Wright (Ipswich MP) (1615\u20131683), English politician", "*John Wright (New Zealand politician) (born 1945), New Zealand MP, 1996\u20132002", "*John Wright (inventor) (1808\u20131844), English surgeon and inventor", "*John Wright (doctor) (1811\u20131846), American doctor and botanist", "*Jocky Wright (1873\u20131946), real name John Wright, Scottish football inside forward for The Wednesday, Plymouth Argyle and others", "*John Wright (American football coach) (born 1948), American college football coach", "*John Wright (basketball) (1921\u20132008), American professional basketball player for the Youngstown Bears", "*John Wright (cricketer, born 1861) (1861\u20131912), English cricketer", "*John Wright (cricketer, born 1954), New Zealand cricketer, former coach of the Indian cricket team ", "*John Wright (cricketer, born 1935), English cricketer", "*John Wright (curler), American curler", "*John Wright (footballer, born 1916) (1916\u20131999), English football half back for Darlington", "*John Wright (footballer, born 1933), English football goalkeeper for Colchester United", "*John Wright (greyhound trainer) (1899\u20131980), born in Little Saughall, Cheshire, the son of Tom Wright and Lizzie Davies", "*John Wright (ice hockey) (born 1948), Canadian ice hockey player", "*John Wright (rugby league), New Zealand rugby league player", "*John Wright (Sheffield cricketer) (1796\u20131857), English cricketer associated with Sheffield Cricket Club", "*John Wright (wide receiver) (born 1946), American football player", "*Sir John Wright, 1st Baronet (1843\u20131926), British steel manufacturer", "*John Wright (Archbishop of Sydney) (1861\u20131933), Anglican bishop in Australia", "*John Wright (bookseller died 1658) (fl. 1602\u20131658), London publisher and bookseller", "*John Wright (bookseller died 1844) (1770/1\u20131844), London bookseller, author, editor and publisher", "*John Wright (British Army officer) (1940\u20132016), British Army brigadier", "*John Wright (businessman) (fl. 1724\u20131787), American businessman who established Wright's Ferry", "*John Wright (cardinal) (1909\u20131979), Roman Catholic bishop in America", "*John Wright (greyhound trainer) (1899\u20131980), British greyhound trainer", "*John Wright (Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge) (died 1519), Master of Trinity Hall 1505\u20131512", "*John Wright (shipbuilder) (1835\u20131910), Scottish/Australian shipbuilder"]}, {"page": "John Wright (1770-1844)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Wright (bookseller died 1844)"]}, {"page": "John Wright (1770\u20131844)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Wright (bookseller died 1844)"]}]}}
