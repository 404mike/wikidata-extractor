He also played in his native country for Rangers and Morton, in Hong Kong for Lai Sun and in the English Football League with Queens Park Rangers. He finished his career in the United States with a three-year spell with the Colorado Rapids. He also earned 14 caps for Scotland.\nSince retiring from playing in 2004, Spencer has remained in America, and was assistant coach of Houston Dynamo before becoming head coach of the Portland Timbers in 2011 until being relieved of his coaching position on 9 July 2012. He returned to the Colorado Rapids as an assistant coach in 2016, before joining the San Jose Earthquakes in a similar role for the 2017 season, until both he and head coach Dominic Kinnear were let go on 25 June 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Motherwell F.C.", "response": ["With Tommy McLean's departure to Hearts in 1994, much of his squad was broken up; a large fee in particular was paid by Celtic for Phil O'Donnell. Much of this money was reinvested in the squad, while the club cycled through managers including Alex McLeish and Harri Kampman. At this point, in August 1998, John Boyle bought the club, taking over from John Chapman. Billy Davies was appointed as manager, and large transfer fees were paid for prominent players including ex-Scotland internationals John Spencer and Andy Goram. The investment though failed to provide results on the pitch.", "The record transfer fee paid by the club was to Everton for John Spencer in 1999 (\u00a3500,000) and the highest received was David Turnbull for his move to Celtic in 2020 (\u00a33.25m), eclipsing the 1.75m paid for previous record holder Phil O'Donnell in 1994. O'Donnell rejoined Motherwell in 2004, but his second spell at Fir Park ended when he died after collapsing on the pitch in a game against Dundee United on 29 December 2007."]}, {"page": "San Jose Earthquakes", "response": ["Fioranelli took his ambitions for San Jose a step further just several days later, when he announced on June 25, 2017, that Dominic Kinnear had been fired, and would be replaced immediately and permanently by Chris Leitch, the club's technical director and former interim general manager. Assistant coach John Spencer was also let go, and was replaced by Covelo. The timing of the firing came as somewhat of a surprise, as it was announced hours after San Jose defeated Real Salt Lake 2\u20131 at home. Fioranelli said of the firing that, coming off of a win, it was not reactionary, and rather he had \"in the last two to three months...matured a gut feeling as to where [the club stands]\", and that his respect for Kinnear \"would not have allowed [him] to want to go for another three months knowing [they] would have parted ways at the end of the season\". In his first interview as head coach, Leitch reiterated Fioranelli's previously stated goals, saying that \"the goal of the team...is [to] make the playoffs\". His first outing as head coach on June 28, 2017, was successful, seeing the Earthquakes achieve their first-ever victory over an MLS side in the U.S. Open Cup with a 2\u20131 victory against Seattle Sounders FC that would advance them to the USOC quarter finals for the first time since 2012."]}, {"page": "Colorado Rapids", "response": ["In 2001 Tim Hankinson took the reins as Colorado's new head coach. Scottish striker John Spencer also joined the club that year. While Hankinson did bring effective players like Mark Chung, Chris Henderson, Carlos Valderrama, and Joe Cannon to the squad\u2014and made the playoffs every year\u2014Hankinson also signed a number of expensive and unsuccessful players including Zizi Roberts and Darryl Powell. During his coaching stint, the club also traded away club legend Marcelo Balboa, who would play one game for MetroStars before retiring.", "2003 saw the club change their identity, with a rebranding that brought in the new team identity and color scheme of black and blue. Mark Chung and forward John Spencer had banner years. Spencer, the Rapids' team captain, set a new team record by scoring in six consecutive games and tied his own team record with 14 goals on the season. He finished the season third in MLS with 33 points, was a finalist for Honda MVP and was named to the MLS Pepsi Best XI. Joining him on the Best XI was Chung, who tied his career-high of a year prior with 11 goals and was second on the team with 28 points. This was Chung's second consecutive appearance on the MLS Best XI and it marked the first time in league history that two Rapids had been so honored in the same season.", "*  #7 John Spencer (inducted 2009)", "|align=left| John Spencer"]}, {"page": "Gorbals", "response": ["* John Spencer (Scottish footballer) (b. 1970), football player and manager"]}, {"page": "John Spencer", "response": ["John Spencer may refer to:", "*John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer (1734\u20131783), MP for Warwick 1756\u20131761", "*John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer (1782\u20131845), British politician", "*John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer (1835\u20131910), British politician", "*John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (1924\u20131992), father of Diana, Princess of Wales", "*John Spencer (courtier) (died 1417), a servant of Henry V, MP for Suffolk, and High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1416", "*Sir John Spencer (died 1522) (1455\u20131522), English landowner in Northamptonshire", "*Sir John Spencer (sheriff) (1524\u20131586), MP for Northamptonshire and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire", "*Sir John Spencer (died 1600) (1549\u20131600), MP for Northampton, 1572 and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire 1578,1590", "*John Spencer (Lord Mayor of London) (died 1610), merchant and Lord Mayor of London", "*John Spencer (British politician) (1708\u20131746), father of the 1st Earl Spencer", "*John Spencer (mayor) (born 1946), former mayor of Yonkers, New York and an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate", "*John Spencer (snooker player) (1935\u20132006), English snooker player", "*John Spencer (Scottish footballer) (born 1970), Scottish international football player and manager", "*John Spencer (footballer, born 1934) (1934\u20132007), English football player for Sheffield United", "*John Spencer (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u2013?), English football player for Stoke", "*John Spencer (rugby union) (born 1947), former English national rugby union team captain", "*John Spencer (cricketer, born 1949), former Sussex cricketer", "*John Spencer (cricketer, born 1954), former Wiltshire cricketer", "*John Spencer (rugby) (1880\u20131936), New Zealand rugby player", "*John Spencer (Australian footballer) (1927\u20131998), Australian rules footballer", "*John Spencer (rugby league, born 1946) (1946\u20132021), Australian rugby league player", "*John Spencer (priest) (1630\u20131693), English clergyman and scholar, Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge", "*John Spencer (actor) (1946\u20132005), American actor in television series' including L.A.

Dicks' performances had earlier given rise to journalists to call for his inclusion in the squad. Two further disciplinary events ended such calls. On 11 September 1995 he was booked for stamping on the head of Chelsea's John Spencer in a 3\u20131 home defeat for West Ham. Spencer required eight stitches in his head. On 16 September 1995 at Highbury he was dismissed for the eighth time in his career for a foul on Arsenal's Ian Wright. The two incidents coming so close together caused the media to focus on the incident involving John Spencer. TV pundit Andy Gray and politician, radio journalist and Chelsea supporter, David Mellor called for FA to get involved. The game had been televised live on Sky TV and a recording of it was provided to the match referee, Robbie Hart who had booked Dicks during the game. The Sun newspaper ran a full back-page on the incident with several pictures of the challenge and of blood on Spencer's face. Mellor's radio program, 606, had focused so intently on the clash that combined with The Sun's coverage, public focus was sufficient for Dicks' daughters to be attacked at their school in Essex. The FA considered the video evidence provided and a report from referee Hart and Dicks was given a three-match ban. This ban put in doubt any future involvement in England squads due to concerns over his indiscipline and he was not called into the Euro 96 squad."]}, {"page": "Kris Boyd", "response": ["Boyd scored his first goal for the Timbers on 4 March 2012 during a pre-season exhibition against AIK of Sweden.
