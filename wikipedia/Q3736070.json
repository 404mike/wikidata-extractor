Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.  David's influence on British cooking extended to professional as well as domestic cooks, and chefs and restaurateurs of later generations such as Terence Conran, Simon Hopkinson, Prue Leith, Jamie Oliver, Tom Parker Bowles and Rick Stein have acknowledged her importance to them. In the US, cooks and writers including Julia Child, Richard Olney and Alice Waters have written of her influence.", "Some critics, used to more prescriptive cookery writers, thought her approach assumed too much knowledge on the part of the reader.Chaney, pp. 266\u2013267 In her view, \"The ideal cookery writer is one who makes his readers want to cook as well as telling them how it is done; he should leave something, not too much perhaps, but a little, unsaid: people must make their own discoveries, use their own intelligence, otherwise they will be deprived of part of the fun.\"Quoted in Bilton, Sam. \"The Cult of Elizabeth David\", English Heritage, 18 May 2016.

The writer Julian Barnes commented that as an amateur cook he found David's terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in Italian Food  he wrote, \"E.D.'s first sentence reads like this: 'Melt 1\u00bd lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil'\u00a0... Melt? Melt a tomato?\u00a0... Could it be that Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?\".Barnes, pp. 59\u201360 A later cook, Tom Parker Bowles, observes, \"You don't turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads.\"Parker Bowles, Tom. \"Classic Elizabeth David recipes\", The Observer, 8 December 2013.
