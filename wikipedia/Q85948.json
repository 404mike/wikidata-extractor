By the next year, the orchestra had a deficit of \u00a35,000.  In 1951, the incoming executive chairman of the CBSO committee approached Rudolf Schwarz to take over as the orchestra's new chief conductor, letting Weldon know that his contract would not be renewed. John Barbirolli was furious at Weldon's treatment and immediately appointed him Associate Conductor of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, but the committee considered the move a \"change to a conductor of a higher calibre\" and Weldon's replacement was viewed by the CBSO's players as a forward looking one. Schwarz had a well-established career as an operatic conductor in pre-war Germany, but his role as Music Director of the Jewish Cultural Organisation in Berlin led to him being interned by the Nazis in Belsen, from where he was rescued in 1945. He was highly respected among musicians and had rebuilt the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra after World War II. Adrian Boult wrote to him commending Birmingham as having \"the nicest people\" and assuring him he would enjoy the city, with Schwarz later concluding \"He was absolutely right! I found that Birmingham was alive - a city with people who work.\"", "Rignold updated the orchestra's repertoire, conducting 31 premieres during his tenure. The era saw Birmingham's first complete performances of works including Debussy's Images, Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9, Schoenberg's Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht and Walton's Violin Concerto, and a series themed around \"Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century\" was held in 1966 and 1967. Like Leslie Heward and Rudolf Schwarz before him, Rignold was particularly committed to the music of Sibelius, giving a complete cycle of his symphonies in 1966. The most significant premiere of the period, indeed of the CBSO's entire history, saw the orchestra play the first performance of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem at the dedication of Coventry Cathedral in 1962, accompanied by Peter Pears, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Heather Harper and the Melos Ensemble, conducted by Meredith Davies and the composer himself.  This event saw the orchestra attracting international attention for the first time since the first Boult era. The Daily Telegraph described the work as \"a masterpiece of the first order\", Fischer-Dieskau wept during rehearsals and at the end of the performance Harper noticed that \"all around her people were in tears\".", "* Rudolf Schwarz (1951\u20131957)"]}, {"page": "Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["Principal conductors of the orchestra have included Sir Dan Godfrey, Rudolf Schwarz, Constantin Silvestri, Paavo Berglund, Andrew Litton and Marin Alsop.

In 1947, Rudolf Schwarz was appointed Musical Director of a re-formed orchestra of 60. He conducted the orchestra in its first concert in London since 1911, at the Royal Albert Hall in 1948, and in two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall during the Festival of Britain in 1951.

Boult's successor, Sir Malcolm Sargent, was popular with the public but had poor rapport with his players, and orchestral morale dropped. Sargent's successor, Rudolf Schwarz, made relatively little impact, and although the BBC appointed high-profile chief conductors in the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 Antal Dor\u00e1ti, Colin Davis, Pierre Boulez and Gennady Rozhdestvensky \u2013 the BBC SO remained underfunded. However, as the sole symphony orchestra in London that offered its players full-time contracts, players of high repute, including Alan Civil (horn) and John Wilbraham (trumpet), enrolled as regular members.", "In the 1950s, the BBC SO, in common with the rest of the BBC's musical organisation, suffered from stagnation. In the words of the critic Peter Heyworth, \"the Corporation's music department had become a byword for its narrow-mindedness and lassitude\". Boult had been followed as director of music by a series of successors between 1944 and 1959 who either lacked his commitment to modern music or were actively hostile to it. Richard Howgill, who held the post from 1952 to 1959, took the view that although Webern \"might have been a small composer of some significance, Schoenberg wasn't really a composer at all.\"  In addition to working under a conductor it disliked, the BBC SO found its role as a pioneer of progressive music gone, and its performances of the standard classics criticised as under-rehearsed (particularly during Proms seasons) compared with those given by Legge's Philharmonia and others. Sargent's contract was not renewed in 1957, although he continued as chief conductor of the Proms until his death ten years later. Howgill appointed Rudolf Schwarz as chief conductor of the BBC SO. Schwarz failed to restore orchestral standards to pre-war levels, and lacked Sargent's box-office appeal. Under Schwarz, BBC SO concerts other than the Proms drew poor houses \u2013 as low as 29 per cent of capacity in the 1959\u201360 season.Kenyon, p. 292 The manager of the Royal Festival Hall, Ernest Bean, spoke of \"an inherited aura of mediocrity about BBC concerts which keeps people away\".
