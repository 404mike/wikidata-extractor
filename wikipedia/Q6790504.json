Notable exceptions occurred during World War I and World War II. In 1914, Lord Hawke was appointed president and was asked to remain in the post till the end of the war.Pope & Dyson, pp. 50\u201351. As a result, Hawke was MCC President for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler Henry Forster, who shortly afterwards was raised to the peerage with the title of Lord Forster. Throughout the war, Lord's was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in Wisden's view, Hawke was \"the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution\". Hawke's tenure was exceeded by that of Stanley Christopherson who was appointed in 1939 and remained in situ for seven years until 1945 before he was succeeded by General Ronald Adam.Barclay, p. 49. In his Barclays World of Cricket essay about the MCC Presidency, E. W. Swanton said that \"there is no pretence of democracy about it\" and commented on how few were untitled up to the Second World War. As he said, membership of the aristocracy was a more important factor than any cricketing prowess.Barclay, pp. 48\u201349. In the 21st century there have been MCC Presidents who as players were wholly professional: Tom Graveney, Derek Underwood, Mike Gatting and Matthew Fleming. The 2018-19 President, Anthony Wreford, nominated Kumar Sangakkara as his successor in May 2019; Sangakkara became MCC's first non-British President."]}, {"page": "Graeme Hick", "response": ["Calls for Hick's recall to the one-day team continued long after his Test career had been given up as a lost cause: Kent captain Matthew Fleming said in September 2001 that Hick was \"still the best one-day batsman in the country\""]}, {"page": "Charles Leslie (cricketer)", "response": ["His son, John, also played first-class cricket.

Contributions down the order took the total past 400 by the time of their dismissal shortly after lunch on the second day. After the early loss of Mark Benson, Kent batted cautiously until Carl Hooper's arrival at 60/2. He batted fluently in reaching a century from 131 balls and shared 109 in 28 overs for the third wicket with David Ward (63). On the third day Richard Davis took a sharp return catch to dismiss Hooper and although Matthew Fleming struck an aggressive 73, Warwickshire were able to gain a first innings lead. The hosts openers put on a second century stand of the match, before 86 runs in 55 minutes on the fourth morning allowed a declaration. The target of 347 off 82 overs on a turning pitch proved too much as Kent's batsmen were unable to go on after making starts.

While in the Caribbean in 1960, he received two letters in the space of a week offering him coaching roles at Eton College and Tonbridge School, with Cannings choosing Eton. He would coach cricket at Eton for 24 years, retiring in 1984, where he was replaced by John Rice. He coached both John Barclay and England One Day International player Matthew Fleming at Eton. After his retirement from Eton, Cannings was asked to return to coach first year pupils on a part-time basis, which he did until 1993. While coaching at Eton, he played minor counties cricket for Buckinghamshire making ten appearances in the 1960 Minor Counties Championship and two in the 1962 Minor Counties Championship.

By this time, 192 advance engravings of the painting had been ordered, ensuring that Tayler would be well compensated for the work. When the painting was unveiled, it was praised for its accuracy, use of lighting, and shade. In 1908, a limited print signed by Tayler and Lord Harris was created; further prints were made by Kent in 1990 and 2000, and each was signed by current players of their respective times, including Colin Cowdrey, E.W. Swanton, Les Ames and Matthew Fleming. As a result of its popularity, the painting was lent out for display at Rectory Field, Blackheath and Lord's Cricket Ground. The painting is viewed by cricket fans and historians as a notable illustration of the Golden Age of cricket in the Victorian and Edwardian periods before the First World War. Cricket historian E. W. Swanton praised the painting, singling it out as \"one of the finest ever portrayals of distinguished identifiable cricketers in action\".
