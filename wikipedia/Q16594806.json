During this time, he wrote Littlemans Book of Courtesy (1914) and The Play Way, an Essay in Educational Method (1917), his magnum opus. Caldwell Cook saw the current schooling system to impede \"true education\". He used drama to teach English, building a room, called 'the Mummery', in his school based on an Elizabethan theatre, and students improvised plays based on dramatic literature. This idea had been used and publicised by Harriet Finlay-Johnson.Process Drama in Education, Gustave J. Weltsek-Medina, 2008, Retrieved 30 January 2016 He called this method the \"play-way\". The Play Way, the book, argued that learning came from experience doing instead of from listening and reading: \"The natural means of study in youth is play.\" The claim was debated for a generation. The book began as articles for The New Age in 1914 destined for the \"Papers for the Present\" series, but became a book reflecting on his experience at Perse. A 1922 unpublished Board of Education report made the recommendation to not support grants for his program or its imitators."]}]}}
