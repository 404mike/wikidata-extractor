However, before receiving the recommendation, Lord Glenelg had already appointed Royal Navy Rear-Admiral John Hindmarsh as Governor in January 1836. Light was appointed Surveyor General of South Australia the following month, and various other officials were appointed to other positions: James Hurtle Fisher was Resident Commissioner and Registrar; Robert Gouger, Colonial Secretary; John Jeffcott, Judge; Charles Mann, Advocate-General; Osmond Gilles, Colonial Treasurer; George Strickland Kingston Deputy Surveyor, along with a team of assistant surveyors.

Gwynne left for South Australia, arriving in Adelaide aboard the Lord Goderich on 15 April 1838. His appointment as clerk of court was not confirmed and Gwynne immediately applied for admission to the bar and practised as a barrister. In 1840 he entered into partnership with William Bartley, and later was joined by Charles Mann. Gwynne established a reputation as a lawyer, especially for his knowledge of equity law and the law of property. In 1851 he was nominated to the South Australian Legislative Council, and soon afterwards brought in a bill to establish state aid to religion, which was however defeated. In 1853, during the discussion of the proposed new constitution, he spoke in favour of a nominee upper house, but it was eventually decided that the house should be an elected one with a property qualification for voters. Gwynne was defeated at the election for the council for the seat of East Torrens in 1854, but was elected unopposed to the new Legislative Council in 1857. Gwynne opposed the Robert Torrens real property bill, being afraid that it would have dangerous consequences. Though his opposition was not successful his criticisms had the effect of improving the bill. He was Attorney-General of South Australia in the John Baker ministry which lasted for only 10 days in August 1857, and in 1859 was appointed third judge of the South Australian Supreme Court. In 1867 he became second judge and primary judge in equity. From December 1872 to June 1873 he was acting chief justice, and in February 1877 received extended leave of absence to visit England.

He was educated at Southgate, Middlesex before going into the leather trade, building up a business in Sussex. On 9 July 1827, Hack married Bridget Watson (born 27 September 1806), daughter of William Watson of Hardshaw, Lancashire. After an illness which affected his lungs, he was advised to move to a warmer climate. While in Portsmouth he met Captain Thomas Lipson, who was fitting out the \"Buffalo\" for its pioneering voyage to South Australia. This new colony captured his imagination. He read Robert Torrens's book The Colonization of South Australia and met with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and some members of the South Australian Company and was so convinced of the colony's future that he sold up his considerable business interests and purchased three 134-acre sections with their three accompanying town acres. In September 1836 he embarked with his wife, six children and younger brother Stephen (who was to become an explorer of some noteMr. Hack's Exploring Expedition South Australian Register 27 October 1857 p.3 accessed 7 September 2011 and father of Wilton Hack), on the Isabella, commanded by Captain Hart for the owner Griffiths of Launceston, Van Diemen's Land. A surprise last-minute addition to the passenger list was Sir John Jeffcott, who had been appointed Chief Justice of South Australia, and was \"slipping away\" surreptitiously to avoid creditors. The Isabella's first stop in Australia was Launceston, where he spent a month purchasing livestock and equipment, which were loaded on the Isabella for shipping to South Australia.Street Corner History: Barton Terrace Register News-Pictorial 19 September 1929 p.5 accessed 7 September 2011 His purchases included nearly 400 sheep, six cows and a bull, ten bullocks, a large wagon and a dray, three horses and a Timor pony. Another livestock importer from Launceston aboard the Isabella was Henry Jones (1799-1889), son of a prosperous London oil merchant, and, like Hack, an influential colonist.Yelland, E.M., Henry Jones, Esq., J.P.

In 1838, he purchased Blenkinsop's whaling station at Encounter Bay (Blenkinsop had drowned with Sir John Jeffcott at the Murray Mouth the previous December). He squatted 400 head of cattle at Mount Barker, but was moved on in 1839. Not put off, he then bought  of land at nearby Echunga Springs and made his home there.
