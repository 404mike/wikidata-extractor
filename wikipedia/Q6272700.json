This was taken entirely literally from a very odd horoscope by Jonathan Cainer, which Gorman deemed so implausible that he did in fact present the copy of the newspaper which published it in the studio, while noting his suspicion that perhaps the author of the horoscope found out about his experiment and was pulling a prank on him."]}, {"page": "Divine Light Mission", "response": ["*Jonathan Cainer\"The Mail man, the Maharaji and the exploding love-bomb: Francis Wheen on: Divine intervention at the Daily Mail.\" Francis Wheen, The Guardian London, England, 14 July 1999"]}, {"page": "List of astrologers", "response": ["*Jonathan Cainer"]}, {"page": "Hello!

While on the Express he regularly invited the paper's astrologer Jonathan Cainer to join editorial conferences to give them an added perspective.

He commented that some issues contain opinions which \"make my hair go white\" and asserted that some journalists \"would resign if I told them what to write\". Peter Preston noted: \"He can hire leading voices from the Guardian or the Observer and let them say exactly what they'd have said in their old homes.\" The astrologer Jonathan Cainer was first taken on for a Mail horoscope column in December 1992. Given to an unconventional dress code Dacre found objectionable, his contract had a clause insisting he wore a suit. Cainer, who spent the bulk of his career at the Mail although he \"never once agreed with an editorial they have published\", was the highest paid journalist of his era. ", "Dacre has pursued a strategy of appointing star columnists established at other newspapers at significantly raised salaries, including in 2006, Peter Oborne (for \u00a3200,000 per annum) and Tom Utley (for \u00a3120,000). Richard Littlejohn was then on \u00a3700,000 a year. Contractual problems have sometimes broken into the open. Astrologer Jonathan Cainer, before his 2000\u20134 sojourn when he worked for other titles, was offered \u00a31 million to stay with the Mail because he was thought vital to sustaining the paper's circulation over the Daily Express. This dispute led to a court case against Cainer which the Mail lost. Another legal entanglement came in 2005 with The Sun when the terms of Littlejohn's contract came into conflict with his obligations to his former newspaper. Dacre's appearance in the High Court was only averted by a few days.\"Sun meets Mail half way in battle for Littlejohn\",  Press Gazette, 25 October 2005. Retrieved 9 July 2007.

He produced four astrology supplements a year for The Mail on Sunday, with the release of each supplement raising the paper's circulation by a quarter of a million copies for the issue they were contained in, before leaving in 1992 to be replaced by Jonathan Cainer. He was reported to have earned over \u00a3500,000 for his Evening Standard column. A daily column written by Walker appeared in over 100 American and Canadian newspapers, including The New York Times, with a weekly column appearing in the TV Guide and a monthly column in Mirabella magazine. Walker's columns were also syndicated in South America, the Middle East and Asia and he was responsible for a number of astrological phone-lines, which users could ring at the rate of 49p per minute, as well as writing The Patric Walker Birthday Book for children, with profits going to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. His readership was estimated to be one billion worldwide. Walker acted as a mentor to Shelley von Strunckel, who covered for Walker when he fell ill in 1991 and took over the astrology column in Walker's old newspaper, the Evening Standard, in December 1995."]}]}}
