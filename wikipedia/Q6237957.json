the Thomas Conolly of Castletown House of Celbridge to the west of Dublin. He inherited Castletown House in 1758 and his wife Lady Louisa Conolly (who was the daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond), set about redecoration and refurbishment of this Palladian mansion. Barret supplied a painting of the house in the distance with wooded parkland and a river. The trees are depicted in outline and not in Barret's later spindly way.

With the Banqueting House it is one of the few surviving reminders in London of the Italianate court style of King Charles I.

In the 'Great Chamber' twenty-two paintings were displayed with fifty-nine pieces of Roman sculpture, many of which were heads. In the 'Gallery' were a further thirty-one heads and statues.
