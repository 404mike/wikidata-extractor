The initial draft included an illustration of Harry by a fireplace, showing a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Following an enthusiastic report from Bryony Evens, an early reader, Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling. It was submitted to twelve publishers, all of which rejected the manuscript. Barry Cunningham, who ran the children's literature department at Bloomsbury Publishing, eventually bought it. Nigel Newton, who headed Bloomsbury at the time, decided to go ahead with the manuscript after his eight-year-old daughter finished one chapter and wanted to keep reading. Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, one of Rowling's favourite memories was of Cunningham telling her, \"You'll never make any money out of children's books, Jo.\" In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 500\u00a0copies. Rowling received grants in 1996 and 1997 from the Scottish Arts Council to support writing Philosopher's Stone and the sequel, Chamber of Secrets."]}, {"page": "Selwyn College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Nigel Newton"]}, {"page": "1986 in literature", "response": ["*September 29 \u2013 Bloomsbury Publishing is set up in London by Nigel Newton."]}, {"page": "Bloomsbury Publishing", "response": ["The company was founded in 1986 by Nigel Newton, who  had previously been employed by other publishing companies.
