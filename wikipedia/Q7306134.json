Ironically, one of the strongest teams ever entered saw this streak ending. In 1974, Syed Shahid Ali and Arturo Goetz were both on three goals, with the remaining players one-goalers. Cambridge could only form a team with a total handicap of minus one but were nonetheless victorious. Many of the players from this period are now well-known figures in the polo world. General Sir Redmond Watt played off a two-goal handicap while at university and subsequently became one of the highest rated Old Blue after the war when he peaked at five-goals. Claire Tomlinson (n\u00e9e Lucas), who was rated at nought-goals at university, became one of polo's few true masters of the number one position and the first woman in the world to rise to five goals. She swept away the rule forbidding women in British high-goal and became the first to compete on equal terms with men at the top tier.Horace A. Laffaye: The Evolution of Polo. McFarland & Company: London 2012, p. 207. Her participation in the Varsity Match 1964 as the first female player was a milestone in the history of the match. In 1966, she became the first female captain of OUPC. It was also through the coaching of her father Arthur Lucas and his Easter Vacation Training Camps at Woolmer's Park, at the home of the Lucas family, that many young riders were encouraged to start playing polo at university.Justin Cartwright: This secret Garden.
