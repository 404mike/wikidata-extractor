McCann signed for Celtic aged 14, but a bad knee injury halted his progress there. He later played for Linlithgow Rose, Alloa Athletic, Berwick Rangers and East Stirlingshire. He then managed Alloa Athletic, Queen's Park and East Stirlingshire. He has run the youth development systems of Alloa Athletic and Raith Rovers. McCann has also worked in coaching roles for Hearts, Aberdeen, Kilmarnock and Dundee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queen's Park F.C.", "response": ["Eddie Hunter was fired in December 1994 as Queen's failed to recapture the achievements of the previous decade. Former Alloa Athletic manager Hugh McCann was appointed as his successor but after an 8th-place finish in the new 10 team Third Division, he left the club. Graeme Elder took over as player/coach but the team continued their disappointing run and he eventually resigned. A happier memory from this time was the 5\u20131 demolition of Albion Rovers at Hampden in August 1997, the opposition finishing the match with seven players. There was also an incredible 5\u20135 draw at East Fife in Hunter's last season, with fan favourite Brian McPhee scoring four goals for Queen's."]}, {"page": "Alloa Athletic F.C.", "response": ["*  Hugh McCann (1990\u201393)"]}, {"page": "Closer to Truth", "response": ["Many well known intellectuals have been featured on Closer to Truth.
