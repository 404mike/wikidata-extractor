Between the Truce and the signing of the Treaty the Second D\u00e1il only sat on 10 days, and did not discuss in detail the options available to it. The debate on the Treaty started on 14 December, and continued for thirteen days of debate until 7 January 1922. On that date, the D\u00e1il approved the treaty by 64 in favour to 57 against. The Treaty Debates were the first publicly reported debate on what Sinn F\u00e9in felt that it had achieved and could achieve. In the vote, the deputies who represented more than one constituency were each only permitted to vote once, but this would not have changed the outcome. As the leader of the anti-Treaty minority de Valera resigned as President, and on 9 January his opponent Arthur Griffith was elected as president on a vote of 60\u201358.
