When Patric Stevenson took the President's role in 1970 he personally oversaw the stabilisation of its finances and preservation of its records. Standards began to improve after T P Flanagan took the reins in 1978 as he held considerable influence over his students at the Belfast College of Art, in encouraging participation from younger and more adventurous artists. Others such as Raymond Piper, Neil Shawcross, and later Joe McWilliams and Bob Sloan did similarly. During David Evan's Presidency from 1983 to 1993 the Academy's Annual show was held at Queen's University, Belfast before returning to the Ulster Museum under Rowel Friers.Carruthers, M., and Douds, S., (2001), p.109", "Presidents of the Academy have included Sir John Lavery R.A, Morris Harding, William Conor, Mercy Hunter, T.P.
