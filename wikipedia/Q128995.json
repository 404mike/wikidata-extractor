He again held that position for most of the Second World War, and a third time in the early 1950s. Having been deputy to Winston Churchill for almost 15 years, Eden succeeded him as the Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister in April 1955, and a month later won a general election.\nEden's reputation was overshadowed in 1956 when the United States refused to support the Anglo-French military response to the Suez Crisis, which critics across party lines regarded as a historic setback for British foreign policy, signalling the end of British predominance in the Middle East. Most historians argue that he made a series of blunders, especially not realising the depth of American opposition to military action. Two months after ordering an end to the Suez operation, he resigned as prime minister on grounds of ill health and because he was widely suspected of having misled the House of Commons over the degree of collusion with France and Israel.Eden is generally ranked among the least successful British prime ministers of the 20th century, although two broadly sympathetic biographies (in 1986 and 2003) have gone some way to shifting the balance of opinion. Biographer D. R. Thorpe described the Suez Crisis as \"a truly tragic end to his premiership, and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his career.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Empire", "response": ["In July 1956, Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal. The response of Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal.James, p.\u00a0581. Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion. Another of Eisenhower's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives,James, p.\u00a0583. UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.Combs, pp.\u00a0161\u201363."]}, {"page": "Birmingham Small Arms Company", "response": ["The creation of the Home Guard (initially as the Local Defence Volunteers) following Anthony Eden's broadcast appeal to the Nation on Tuesday 14 May 1940 also created further demand for arms production to equip this new force.

The Hungarian foreign minister, P\u00e1l Teleki who wanted to maintain a pro-allied neutral stance for Hungary, could no longer keep the country out of the war, as the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden had threatened to break diplomatic relations with Hungary if it did not actively resist the passage of German troops across its territory, and General Henrik Werth, chief of the Hungarian General Staff made a private arrangement - unsanctioned by the Hungarian government - with the German High Command for the transport of the German troops across Hungary. P\u00e1l Teleki, no longer being able to stop the unfolding events, committed suicide on April 3, 1941, and Hungary joined the war on April 11 after the proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia."]}, {"page": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom", "response": ["A prime minister will resign after party defeat at an election if unable to form a coalition, or obtain a confidence and supply arrangement. He or she may also resign after a motion of no confidence in the prime minister or for personal reasons. In such cases, the premiership goes to whoever can command a majority in the House, unless there is a hung parliament and a coalition is formed; the new prime minister will by convention be the new leader of the resigner's party. It has become the practice to write the constitutions of major UK political parties to provide a set way to appoint a new party leader.Until 1965, the Conservative Party had no fixed mechanism for this. In 1957, when Anthony Eden resigned as prime minister without recommending a successor, it was unable to nominate one. It fell to the Queen to appoint Harold Macmillan as the new prime minister, after seeking a consensus from cabinet ministers."]}, {"page": "\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc", "response": ["The signing of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 drew Turkey away from the Allies; the Turks always believed that it was essential to have the Soviet Union as an ally to counter Germany, and thus the signing of the German-Soviet pact undercut completely the assumptions behind Turkish security policy.Watt, D.C. How War Came : The Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938\u20131939, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 310. With the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc chose to be neutral in World War II as taking on Germany and the Soviet Union at the same time would be too much for Turkey, through he signed a treaty of alliance with Britain and France on 19 October 1939.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 78 It was only with France's defeat in June 1940 that \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc abandoned the pro-Allied neutrality that he had followed since the beginning of the war. A major embarrassment for the Turks occurred in July 1940 when the Germans captured and published documents from the Quai d'Orsay in Paris showing the Turks were aware of Operation Pike\u2014as the Anglo-French plan in the winter of 1939\u201340 to bomb the oil fields in the Soviet Union from Turkey was codenamed\u2014which was intended by Berlin to worsen relations between Ankara and Moscow.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 970 In turn, worsening relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey were intended to drive Turkey into the arms of the Reich. After the publication of the French documents relating to Operation Pike, \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc had to sign the German\u2013Turkish Treaty of Friendship and the Clodius Agreement, which placed Turkey within the German economic sphere of influence, but \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc went no further towards the Axis.In the first half of 1941, Germany which was intent upon invading the Soviet Union went out of its way to improve relations with Turkey as the Reich hoped for a benevolent Turkish neutrality when the German-Soviet war began.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 pages 196-197. At the same time, the British had great hopes in the spring of 1941 when they dispatched an expeditionary force to Greece that \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc could be persuaded to enter the war on the Allied side as the British leadership had high hopes of creating a Balkan front that would tie down German forces, and which thus led a major British diplomatic offensive with the Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden visiting Ankara several times to meet with \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 pages 216-216. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc always told Eden that the Turks would not join the British forces in Greece, and the Turks would only enter the war if Germany attacked Turkey.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 219. For his part, Papen offered \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc parts of Greece if Turkey were to enter the war on the Axis side, an offer \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc declined. In May 1941 when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the British, \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc refused Papen's request that the German forces be allowed transit rights to Iraq.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 226."]}, {"page": "June 12", "response": ["*1897 \u2013 Anthony Eden, English soldier and politician, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (d. 1977)"]}, {"page": "January 9", "response": ["*1957 \u2013 British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden resigns from office following his failure to retake the Suez Canal from Egyptian sovereignty.

Nehru had a powerful ally in the US president Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout at the International Monetary Fund to make Britain and France back down.

Since Hitler was not interested in obtaining the former colonies, especially if the price was a brake on expansion into Eastern Europe, Ribbentrop was forced to turn down the Anglo-French offer that he had largely brought about.Bloch, p. 146. Immediately after turning down the Anglo-French offer on colonial restoration, Ribbentrop, for reasons of pure malice, ordered the Reichskolonialbund to increase the agitation for the former German colonies, a move that exasperated both the Foreign Office and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs."]}, {"page": "Konrad Adenauer", "response": ["British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden used the failure of the EDC to argue for independent West German rearmament and West German NATO membership.

Adenauer then promised that Germany would never seek to have nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as capital ships, strategic bombers, long-range artillery, and guided missiles, although these promises were non-binding. The French had been assuaged that West German rearmament would be no threat to France.

Lord Halifax, the Lord President of the Council, visited Germany privately in November and met Hitler and other German officials. Both Chamberlain and British Ambassador to Germany Nevile Henderson pronounced the visit a success.

By July 28, Attlee had defeated Churchill and replaced him as Britain\u2019s representative, with Britain's new Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Ernest Bevin, replacing Anthony Eden. Four days of further discussion followed. During the conference, there were meetings of the three heads of government with their foreign secretaries, as well as meetings of only the foreign secretaries. Committees that were appointed by the latter for precursory consideration of questions before the conference also met daily. Important decisions and agreements were reached and views exchanged on a plethora of other questions. However, consideration of those matters was continued by the Council of Foreign Ministers, which was established by the Conference.

The Joint Intelligence Committee, which had a broad co-ordinating role over Britain's intelligence services and operations, took the view that SOE was a more effective organisation than the SIS but that it was unwise to split the responsibility for espionage and more direct action between separate ministries, or to perform special operations outside the ultimate control of the Chiefs of Staff.
