She is the younger half-sister of English musician John Lennon, and is the eldest daughter of his mother Julia Lennon and John 'Bobby' Albert Dykins. She also has an older half-sister, Ingrid Pedersen. Her younger sister is Jacqueline 'Jackie' Dykins (born 26 October 1949).Lennon started visiting the Dykins' house in 1951. After the death of Julia Lennon in 1958, Harriet and Norman Birch were appointed guardians of Julia and Jackie, ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married their mother. Lennon invited the Dykins sisters to visit after the success of the Beatles, when he was living in Kenwood, Weybridge, with his then-wife, Cynthia Lennon.\nJulia Dykins (Baird) married Allen Baird in 1968 and moved to Belfast. They had three children together but were divorced in 1981. Baird worked as a special needs teacher, and after Lennon's death she wrote John Lennon, My Brother (with Geoffrey Giuliano) and gave up working in 2004 to write Imagine This \u2013 Growing up with my brother John Lennon. In 2009, the book was adapted into the film Nowhere Boy. She is now a director of Cavern City Tours in Liverpool.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Giuliano", "response": ["In April 2009, The Daily Telegraph in London reported that Giuliano was instructing lawyers to file suit against Julia Baird, Lennon's half-sister and the co-author of his book John Lennon, My Brother. Giuliano maintained that Baird had based her 2007 book Imagine This, which was being adapted for screen as the Miramax film Nowhere Boy, on material he had gathered in their earlier collaboration. Giuliano stated that his lawsuit would request the recall and destruction of Baird's book, as well as a halt to the production of Nowhere Boy. The following month, Kevin Loader, the film's producer, commented on the story: \"It's nothing to do with us. I haven't heard from anyone's lawyers.\""]}, {"page": "Janet Albrechtsen", "response": ["Albrechtsen was a member of the Foreign Affairs Council from 2003 until 2007.\"Lawyer-turned-columnist Janet Albrechtsen talks pop culture, public figures and guilty pleasures\" by Julia Baird, ABC News (Australia), 22 October 2014"]}, {"page": "Day Tripper", "response": ["The Beatles recorded the song at their first session after completing \"Drive My Car\". The session took place at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 16 October 1965. Unusually for the time, the group allowed visitors into the studio, as Lennon's wife Cynthia and his half-sisters Julia Baird and Jacqui Dykins attended part of the session. The band rehearsed the song for much of the afternoon before taping the basic track. The line-up was Lennon and Harrison on rhythm and lead guitar, respectively, McCartney on bass and Starr on drums."]}]}}
