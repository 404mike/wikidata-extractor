The audition sequence went on to be written into episode four. Producer Barry Letts was keen to write for the show and decided that a story dealing in black magic would be interesting as well as frightening. Script editor Terrance Dicks had reservations however, stating that people may view it as Satanist, and so it was reworked as strictly scientific with occultist themes. The Master was originally intended to worship the demon in a church set, standing on an altar. However, owing to fears that this might upset religious viewers, the scenes were reset in a crypt. This was subsequently revised again, and the crypt was called a cavern, although the set clearly resembled a church crypt.The D\u00e6mons BBC DVD release, 2012. Production subtitles Letts initially intended to write the story himself but found himself short of time due to role as series producer. His wife suggested a friend of hers, Robert Sloman, who was a playwright and journalist. Together they worked on the script in the evening after work. At the time, however, the BBC frowned upon production staff writing for their own series and so Letts and Sloman decided on the pseudonym Guy Leopold - Sloman's son and Letts' middle name respectively. The working title for this story was The Demons, which was commissioned on 17 December 1970. The scripts were completed by mid-February 1971 and worked on by Dicks, who had barely completed work on them by the time the story went into pre-production in March.", "The script of this serial, credited to Robert Sloman and Barry Letts edited by John McElroy, and titled , was published by Titan Books in October 1992."]}, {"page": "Malcolm Hulke", "response": ["* Doctor Who and the Green Death (1975) (adapted from The Green Death, written by Robert Sloman)"]}, {"page": "Barry Letts", "response": ["Letts formed a particularly close partnership with two other contributors to the programme: Terrance Dicks, who was the script editor on the programme between 1968 and 1974; and playwright Robert Sloman, with whom Letts co-wrote four serials in the Pertwee era: The D\u00e6mons (credited under the pen-name Guy Leopold); The Time Monster; The Green Death; and Planet of the Spiders, which was Pertwee's swansong. Letts later provided an official obituary for Sloman in December 2005, published in The Guardian. Letts was a Buddhist and also held liberal political views.

This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.", "The Third Doctor's final story was to be The Final Game by Robert Sloman and Barry Letts as an uncredited co-writer which was commissioned on 15 February 1973.
