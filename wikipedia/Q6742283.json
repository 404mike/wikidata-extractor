In addition to writing books, he was a journalist for Record Mirror, Kerrang!, Metal Hammer and Classic Rock among others. Dome co-founded the UK's first rock radio station, TotalRock, along with Friday Rock Show DJ Tommy Vance and producer Tony Wilson. After 17 years with the station, Dome left in March 2014 to join Team Rock full-time.\nDome is credited with the term \"thrash metal\". It was first referred to by the music press in Kerrang! by Dome while making a reference to the Anthrax song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" in issue number 62, page 8, published on 23 February 1984. Prior to this, Metallica's frontman James Hetfield referred to their sound as \"power metal\".\nDome was a contributor to the DVDs Queen Under Review 1973-1980, Queen Under Review 1980-1991 and Music Milestones: Genesis's Duke. He also provided sleeve notes for the Nuclear Burn 4CD remaster set of jazz fusion band Brand X's work between 1976 and 1980.It was announced on 1 November 2021 that Dome had died, aged 66.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Black metal", "response": ["In the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as Alan 'Nemtheanga' Averill says, \"you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound, and there was German bands and Swiss bands and that kind of thing.\" By the mid-1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, Kerrang! journalist Malcolm Dome said that \"black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country\". Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as synthesizers and even full-symphony orchestras. By the late 1990s, the underground concluded that several of the Norwegian pioneers\u2014like Emperor,Wolf-R\u00fcdiger M\u00fchlmann: War Black Metal: Die Extremsten der Extremen.

The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard down-picked riff. \"Escape\" is Hetfield's most disliked Metallica song, due to it being the result of the record company forcing Metallica to write something more radio friendly. Book authors Mick Wall and Malcolm Dome said the song was influenced by the album-oriented rock of 1970s bands such as Journey and Foreigner, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay on rock radio. Metallica has so far performed \"Escape\" live only once, at the 2012 Orion Music\u00a0+ More festival, while performing Ride the Lightning in its entirety."]}, {"page": "Metallica", "response": ["The term \"thrash metal\" was coined in February 1984 by Kerrang! journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\". Prior to this, Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as \"power metal\". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in the band Trauma. The two were \"blown away\" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he \"didn't contribute anything, he just followed\". Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year, he had accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983)."]}, {"page": "Thrash metal", "response": ["The term \"thrash metal\" was first used in the music press by Kerrang! magazine's journalist Malcolm Dome while making a reference to another of the \"Big Four\", Anthrax (who, like Metallica, formed in 1981), and their song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\". Prior to this, Metallica frontman James Hetfield referred to his band's sound as speed metal or power metal."]}, {"page": "Fistful of Metal", "response": ["Critical reception to Fistful of Metal was mixed. Xavier Russel of Kerrang! called it a great debut album, with songs played \"at a hundred miles an hour\" which could just have been \"slightly more original.\" Writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin called the cover art \"tasteless\", but commended the album's small, but steady commercial performance. AllMusic's Steve Huey said Anthrax had not found its distinctive style yet, sounding more like a Judas Priest cover band. Huey found the lyrics utilizing heavy metal stereotypes and opined fans would find the record \"off-putting\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised the well-produced sound and the \"almost operatic anti-thrash vocals\" from Turbin, considering the album responsible for \"putting New York back on the US metal map, and quality back in the books of bruising and uncompromising underground metal.\" The term thrash metal was used for the first time in the music press by Kerrang! journalist Malcolm Dome, referring to the song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\"."]}, {"page": "Among the Living", "response": ["On Classic Rock magazine, Malcolm Dome appreciated the consistent quality of the album and wrote that Anthrax's \"musicianship is on par with anything Metallica were doing at the time.\" J. D. Considine of Rolling Stone wrote that \"Benante and his bandmates may have been regular guys in other respects, but as musicians there was no denying the technical agility that went into each aural onslaught\". He also remarked how Anthrax strived to be equal to their fans in the mosh pits and \"democratized (their) brilliance by attaching it to some of the band\u2019s catchiest, most approachable material.\" According to Greg Moffitt of BBC Music, Among the Living stroke \"a deft balance between marauding speed and judicious use of melody, a juggling feat they\u2019d fumble on later albums.\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff had the same opinion about the music, but observed how the introduction for the first time of \"a punk ethic\" in songs like \"Caught in a Mosh\", \"Efilnikufesin\" and \"One World\" started to undermine \"the seriousness of the band, something that was soon to cause image problems.\" In fact, the album was a critical success, but Anthrax were criticized by both journalists and fans for the inconsistency of their musical evolution and, most of all, for their stage look, which was made up of short pants and t-shirts with commercial images or hardcore logos, in striking contrast with the denim and leather apparel of other thrash metal groups.; ;  The band members' apparent endorsement of the skateboarding world was another reason for controversy in contemporary music magazines and among fans."]}, {"page": "Whitesnake", "response": ["Slip of the Tongue was released on 7 November 1989 in the US, followed by a worldwide release on 13 November. It reached number ten on the UK Albums Chart, as well as the Billboard 200. The record also charted in twelve additional countries. The lead single was a re-recorded version of \"Fool for Your Loving\", originally found on 1980's Ready an' Willing. Coverdale had been reluctant to re-record the song, let alone release it as the first single, but Geffen Records hoped to repeat the success of \"Here I Go Again\" with another older track. Coverdale later admitted it to regretting the decision. \"Fool for Your Loving\" only peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100. It fared better on the Album Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at number two. The second single \"The Deeper the Love\" also stalled at number 28 on the Hot 100, while on the Album Rock Tracks chart it reached number four. Reviewing Slip of the Tongue, Malcolm Dome, writing for Raw, described it as \"an album full of generally good songs that rarely sinks below the level of adequacy, but only occasionally explodes\". The combination of Whitesnake and Steve Vai was also met with some criticism, with Thom Jurek, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, describing the pairing as \"questionable\". Coverdale himself would later admit to having mixed feelings about the record, though he's since learned to enjoy and accept it as a part of Whitesnake's catalogue. Slip of the Tongue sold approximately four million copies worldwide. As the previous record sold more than twice that in the US alone, Slip of the Tongue was considered a commercial disappointment.", "Whitesnake have been heavily criticized by the music press for their excessive use of double entendres and sexual innuendos, most egregiously on tracks such as \"Slide It In\", \"Slow an' Easy\" and \"Spit It Out\". Micky Moody, Bernie Marsden and Jon Lord have expressed some discomfort over the band's lyrical content. Coverdale has reiterated that some of his lyrics are meant to provoke laughter more than anything else, stating: \"If I look at sex as an observer [...] there's humour also as well as the serious nitty-gritty stuff and I like to write about this as well.\" He also added that many of his songs are tongue-in-cheek and inspired by his own experiences, not uncommon to other people as well. Coverdale has repeatedly denied any accusations of misogyny or sexism. Marsden conceded that while many of Coverdale's lyrics are not entirely politically correct in a contemporary setting, they were written \"completely tongue-in-cheek\" and are more a product of a bygone era. Music journalist Malcolm Dome compared some of Whitesnake's more suggestive lyrics to a Carry On film with their tongue-in-cheek sensibilities, also noting how in his opinion Coverdale has written songs with \"some real depth and lyrical awareness\", like with \"Sailing Ships\" and \"Love Ain't No Stranger\"."]}, {"page": "James Hetfield", "response": ["In the early days of the band, Metallica experimented with a few different vocals and guitar combinations, essentially creating a setup similar to that of British metal band Diamond Head, another major influence on Hetfield. Some of the options considered included adding another guitar player, having John Roads play lead guitar, as well as asking John Bush from Armored Saint (who later joined Anthrax) to sing for the band. The finalized line-up of the band became Hetfield (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Lars Ulrich (drums), Dave Mustaine (lead guitar), and Ron McGovney (bass), who was soon replaced by Cliff Burton. Hetfield referred to their early sound as power metal.

The magazine's emphasis would change during the 1990s once grunge acts such as Nirvana rose to fame. Kerrang! has at times faced criticism for repeating this process every time a new musical subgenre becomes popular."]}, {"page": "Queen II", "response": ["AllMusic awarded the album 4/5 stars and said, \"Queen is coiled, tense, and vicious here, delivering on their inherent sense of drama, and that gives Queen II real power as music, as well as a true cohesion\". The review observed the album's heaviness and stated \"this never feels as fantastical as Genesis or Uriah Heep\", concluding \"Queen II is one of the favorites of their hardcore fans\". Pitchfork awarded the album 7.8/10, writing, \"Dizzying, overstuffed, and unflinching, Queen II is a die-hard fan favorite, and arguably the band's most underrated record.\" In 2009, The Quietus published an article highlighting Queen's \"lesser-known brilliance\" to coincide with the release of that year's Absolute Greatest compilation, describing Queen II as \"an absolute scorcher of an album\" which features two of the band's best tracks: \"Ogre Battle\" and \"Father to Son\". In 2014, Brian Moore wrote for Houston Press that \"the music is more progressive and the harmonies more advanced than anything from the first album. Queen had so exhausted themselves with the progressive rock style after recording this album that they abandoned the sound entirely for the next one.\" Writing for Classic Rock in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked Queen II as the band's sixth greatest album. He wrote: \"Stylistically there was nothing here that wasn't on the superior debut, and you can hear the band struggling with the traditional 'difficult second album' problems... They had pushed their rock and metal roots as far as they could, and were clearly looking to jump off the train and expand their horizons. It's probably for this reason that the album lacked the sparkle and bite of Queen and the audacity of the subsequent Sheer Heart Attack.\""]}, {"page": "Innuendo (album)", "response": ["In a retrospective review, AllMusic wrote \"Innuendo was a fitting way to end one of rock's most successful careers\". For Classic Rock in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked it as Queen's ninth greatest album, writing that \"Innuendo had a lot of intelligent humour and pathos about it.\" He praised the title track's \"brilliantly synthesised orchestrations\" and added \"Perhaps most poignant of all is the low key yet mesmerising 'These Are The Days Of Our Lives', which ended with Mercury\u2019s whispered paean 'I still love you', which was moving in its simplicity.\" Dome concluded \"The album summed up how Queen could draw people close, yet still keep them at a convenient distance.\""]}, {"page": "Queen (Queen album)", "response": ["Writing for Classic Rock in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked Queen as the band's second greatest album. He described it as a \"glorious hard rock marathon unlike anything else around at the time\", and commented on the \"unmistakably unique sound of Brian May's home-made guitar\", the \"panoramic production of Roy Thomas Baker\" and the \"soaring voice of Freddie Mercury\", adding \"the record was just too powerful, too multi-dimensional and too stunning to sit happily and contentedly in the grooves. The performances were all virtuoso.\""]}, {"page": "Levitation (Hawkwind album)", "response": ["Malcolm Dome reviewed the album for Record Mirror giving it full marks claiming it to be \"a vast improvement on the four albums recorded with Charisma... herald[ing] a return to the Hawkwlnd style of the early '70s... [and] a pleasure to have once more an album that uses blistering sci-fi imagery as an angry searchlight focusing on alternative thought\". Dome felt \"Ginger Baker slot[s] in almost as it were second nature\", highlights \"Dust Of Time\" as \"mystically inspired Eastern melodies and atmospherically desolate synthesisers which engulf the JG Ballardesque\" and the album \"intersperse[s] the serious stuff with more lighthearted, whimsical instrumentals.\""]}, {"page": "Inner City Unit", "response": ["Malcolm Dome in Record Mirror thought The Maximum Effect a \"pure music hall eccentricity laced with modern rock idioms... a cross between the Goons, Max Miller, early Stranglers fury and Hawkwind style phrasing... The result, at best, is sharply cynical and bitingly effective.\" He highlights \"Bones of Elvis\" and \"Beer, Baccy, Bingo and Benidorm\" which \"hidden in with the humour is a decided strain of desperation that hits home very solidly indeed... But, sadly, there is an inconsistency running through ME that at times exasperates. So what promised to be an effective new humourist album ends up as adequate but no more.\" AllMusic retrospectively acknowledges \"The faithful declare Maximum Effect to be Inner City Unit's finest hour - and... it's impossible to disagree... only the group's growing penchant for \"obvious\" humo[u]r detracting from some excellent performances. Maximum Effect sounds practically state of the art.\""]}, {"page": "Live and Dangerous", "response": ["A new remastered and expanded version of Live And Dangerous was released in 2011.

There were a couple of lines, like, 'She told me to come but I was already there', which ended up in 'You Shook Me All Night Long' - that\u2019s a Bon lyric. And I saw it. I saw it written down. There were lyrics, lines used, on Back in Black that Bon wrote. [But] he wasn\u2019t credited and to this day no one\u2019s really sure what happened.

It\u2019s hard to be absolutely accurate from a distance of quarter of a century, and through the haze of alcohol which enveloped the night, but one line sticks in my mind as being on one of those sheets: \"She told me to come, but I was already there.\" A renowned lyric from the song You Shook Me All Night Long, it has Bon's trademark all over it - a neatly worked double entendre that fits in with the track record of a man who wrote Big Balls, The Jack and other similarly styled songs.\u2019"]}, {"page": "Metal Hammer", "response": ["*Malcolm Dome"]}, {"page": "Rocka Rolla", "response": ["At this point of the band's career, they had not yet developed their signature look of leather and studs. They had appeared on a British television programme called The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1975, performing \"Rocka Rolla\" and \"Dreamer Deceiver\", and their wardrobe was very \"hippified\" as journalist Malcolm Dome put it. This footage was included on the Electric Eye DVD. In addition, the album is more blues/hard rock oriented than their later releases, and also has some slight progressive rock influences that would continue through to Stained Class, but to a lesser extent, and would be abandoned in later releases. This makes the album's style virtually unrecognizable when compared with later Priest albums, although \"Rocka Rolla\" does feature dual guitars and \"Run of the Mill\" is the first song that was explicitly designed for Halford's, rather than Atkins', vocal range."]}]}}
