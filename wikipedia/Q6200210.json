A midfielder, he scored 39 goals in 535 league and cup appearances in a 13-year career in the English Football League.\nHe spent his youth with Newcastle United, but did not earn a professional contract. Instead he played amateur and semi-professional football with Consett, Crook Town, and Bishop Auckland; he won the FA Amateur Cup with Crook Town in 1964. He entered the Football League with Port Vale in 1966, before transferring to Workington in May 1969. He moved on to Rotherham United in January 1974 for a \u00a33,000 fee, and helped the \"Millers\" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1974\u201375. He ended his playing career after spending the 1978\u201379 season with Stockport County. He then took up coaching with Newport County, Cardiff City, Plymouth Argyle, and Sunderland. He served as Cardiff's manager for six months in 1984, and later worked behind the scenes at the club until his retirement in May 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["In preparation for the 1969\u201370 campaign he released Mick Cullerton, Mick Mahon, Jimmy Goodfellow, Graham Williams, and Milija Aleksic; whilst top-scorer Roy Chapman rejected a new contract and signed with Chester City. Despite this, the club's dire finances meant that he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic). Vale started the season with a club-record unbeaten 18 matches, and Lee began playing midfielder Tommy McLaren on a regular basis. Vale's financial situation was highlighted by the fact that they could not afford the \u00a3500 registration fee for Ian Buxton following the player's departure from Notts County. The \"Valiants\" were knocked off the top of the table following a bout of injuries, and Lee was forced to sign wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston. Speaking of their third-place finish, Lee said that \"no team could have deserved reward as much for their hard work and strength of character\"."]}, {"page": "Frank Burrows", "response": ["Ambitious as a manager, Burrows left Swindon to be appointed assistant manager to Jimmy Dickinson at Portsmouth.
