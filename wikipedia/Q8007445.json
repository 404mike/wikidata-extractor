Clark wrote, \"To write a social history of England from the newspapers of the last twenty years\u2026 demands extraordinary powers of selection and interpretation. Mr. Graves has given us proof that he possesses such powers, but unfortunately in this book he resolutely refuses to use them, misled perhaps by the ideals of the Mass-Observation school. The result is a strange unfocused photograph of the times, in which, although the 'camera-eye' has not lied, it has failed entirely to introduce any perspective or integration.\" A 1941 review by Kirkus Reviews summarized the book with; \"a graphic panorama of fads, fancies, facts, foibles and fingerposts along the way from war to war... Thoroughly good reading of the background of those years, if one wants to look back.\""]}, {"page": "Andrew Kamarck", "response": ["*With William D. Clark. McNamara's Bank.
