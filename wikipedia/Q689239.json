The new constituency takes in territory from the then Liberal Democrat-held Winchester and Conservative-held East Hampshire with uncertain swing between the two parties . Estimates were that the Conservative majority if the seat had existed in 2005 would have been around 2,000 votes. At the 2010 election however, the seat saw one of the largest Liberal Democrat to Conservative swings (9.4%), and the Conservative candidate George Hollingbery was elected with a majority of over 12,000. A similar swing was recorded in the neighbouring Winchester seat, which was a Conservative gain. It would now take a swing of almost 12% for any party to gain Meon Valley and more than 24% swing for Labour.", "| Sir George Hollingbery"]}, {"page": "Minister of State for Trade Policy", "response": ["| George Hollingbery"]}, {"page": "Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee", "response": ["| George Hollingbery MP (Conservative)"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir George Hollingbery; MP for Meon Valley (2010\u20132019)"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury", "response": ["**George Hollingbery", "**George Hollingbery"]}]}}
