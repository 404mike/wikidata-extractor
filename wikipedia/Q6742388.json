Letters to the editor by some specialists and patient advocates expressed concern over generalisability of the results and questioned protocol changes during the course of the trial that resulted in some participants meeting criteria for \u201ctrial recovery\u201d at baseline. The authors of the paper responded in a letter which stated that the protocol changes and other decisions were approved by the Trial Steering Committee. Patient groups expressed disappointment over news media interpreting the definition of \u201crecovery to normal by trial criteria\" as \u201ccured\u201d.  Professor Malcolm Hooper submitted complaints to the Medical Research Council and the Lancet .  The MRC and the Lancet considered the submissions but rejected them. A Lancet editorial expressed suspicions of an active campaign to discredit the research.\""]}, {"page": "Simon Wessely", "response": ["Malcolm Hooper, the Countess of Mar, and others have strongly criticised Wessely. In a 2002 article on chronic fatigue syndrome, The Guardian characterized the criticisms of one group of patients as a \"vendetta.\" Wessely has repeatedly stated he has been the subject of numerous threats and personal attacks, and that \"militants\" have even made threats to his life. \"It is a relentless, vicious, vile campaign designed to hurt and intimidate...For some years now all my mail has been x rayed. I have speed dial phones and panic buttons at police request and receive a regular briefing on my safety and specific threats.\"  Wessely gave up research into CFS around 2001, and as of 2011 his clinical work was with members of the armed forces; he said: \"I now go to Iraq and Afghanistan, where I feel a lot safer\"."]}]}}
