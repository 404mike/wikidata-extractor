Even after the remnants of the Western Roman Empire fell in the 470s, literacy continued to be a distinguishing mark of the elite as communications skills were still important in political and Church life (bishops were largely drawn from the senatorial class) in a new cultural synthesis that made \"Christianity the Roman religion\".Jas Elsner, Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph, 1998, p. 141,  However, these skills were less needed than previously in the absence of the large imperial administrative apparatus whose middle and top echelons the elite had dominated as if by right. Even so, in pre-modern times it is unlikely that literacy was found in more than about 30-40% of the population.This connection is pursued in Alan K. Bowman and Greg Woolf, eds., Literacy and Power in the Ancient World, (Cambridge) 1994. The highest percentage of literacy during the Dark Ages was among the clergy and monks who supplied much of the staff needed to administer the states of western Europe."]}, {"page": "Treveri", "response": ["The Treveri adapted readily to Roman civilization, adopting certain Mediterranean practices in cuisine, clothing, and decorative arts starting as early as the Roman occupation of the Titelberg in 30 BCE. As early as 21 CE, according to Greg Woolf, \"the Treveri and the Aedui [were] arguably those tribes which had undergone the greatest cultural change since the conquest\". The Romans introduced viticulture to the Moselle valley (see Moselle wine). In general, the archaeological record attests to ongoing rural development and prosperity into the 3rd century CE. Along with the neighbouring Remi, the Treveri can be credited with a significant innovation in Roman technology: the vallus, a machine drawn by horses or mules to reap wheat. The vallus is known from funerary reliefs and literary descriptions. The many individual Treveri attested epigraphically in other civitates may attest to the development of a Treveran commercial network within the western parts of the Empire. During the early 2nd century CE, Augusta Treverorum was an important centre for the production of samian ware (along with Lezoux and Rheinzabern), supplying the Rhineland with high-quality glossy red pottery which was often elaborately decorated with moulded designs."]}, {"page": "Eumenius", "response": ["Eumenius was born in Gallia Lugdunensis at Augustodunum (modern-day Autun), the civitas capital of the Celtic Aedui.Greg Woolf, Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2003), p. 1. He was of Greek descent; his grandfather, who had migrated from Athens to Rome, finally settled at Augustodunum as a teacher of rhetoric.

His father, Caburus, is called princeps civitatisBellum Gallicum 7.65.2. of the Helvii, who are identified in this phrase not as a pagus, much less a \"tribe\" (Latin tribus), but as a civitas, a polity with at least small-scale urban centers (oppida).John Koch notes that the Gallo-Brittonic word corresponding to Caesar's usage of civitas is most likely *touta (Old Irish t\u00faath): \"'tribe' would not be a perfect translation, but is less misleading than 'state,' 'city,' or 'nation'\" Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2000), p. 450 online.

It has been argued that princeps denotes a particular office in the Narbonensis,Laurent Lamoine, \"Pr\u00e9teur, vergobret, princeps en Gaule Narbonnaise et dans les Trois Gaules: pourquoi faut-il reprendre le dossier?\" in Les \u00e9lites et leurs facettes: Les \u00e9lites locales dans le monde hell\u00e9nistique et romain (\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome, 2003), p. 191 online, and Le pouvoir local en Gaule romaine (Presses Universitaires Blaise-Pascal, 2009), pp. 74\u201375 online. Christian Goudineau calls Troucillus \"un prince helvien,\" perhaps with the assumption that his father would have been a rix (Latin rex) had the Helvii not been under Roman rule. but the word is usually taken to mean simply a \"leader\" or \"leading citizen.\" Troucillus is listed among legates and envoys for 58 BC in Broughton's Magistrates of the Roman Republic.T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 198. Erich S. Gruen notes the presence of Troucillus among those who demonstrate that Caesar favored men of non-Roman and equestrian origin among his junior officers and lieutenants.Erich S.
