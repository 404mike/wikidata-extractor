Haribhadra, whose commentary is based on the 8,000-line PP S\u016btra, held that the AA is commenting on all PP versions at once (i.e. the 100,000-line, 25,000-line, and 8,000-line versions),Sparham, AA vol. 1, p. xiv; Makransky, p. 129. and this interpretation has generally prevailed within the commentarial tradition.", "During the 2000s, several Western scholars with experience as Buddhist monks living among the Tibetan exile community in Dharamsala, who had participated in traditional geshe studies, published articles and books related to the AA. Their ranks included Gareth Sparham (who translated the AA anew, along with the commentaries of Arya Vimuktisena, Haribhadra, and Tsongkhapa) and Geshe Georges Dreyfus (whose writings describe the contemporary social context of AA study). In addition, studies and translations by Karl Brunnh\u00f6lzl and the Padmakara Translation Group have focused on non-Gelug readings of this text, which the earlier literature had neglected. The AA has also received attention from several Western dharma centers (notably those associated with the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, whose \"Masters Program\" devotes several years to its study), with the result that the AA has now been transmitted to the West not only as a text, but as a living spiritual tradition."]}]}}
