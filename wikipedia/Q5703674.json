On 20 October 1921, The Times reported that the 'St. Pancras Borough Council last night decided, by 45 votes to three, to adhere to their decision dismissing Dr. Gladys Miall-Smith from her appointment as assistant medical officer for maternity.'  The Medical Woman's Journal wrote:It appears that the council's decision is mainly based on the theory that, because there is widespread unemployment, married women whose husbands are able to support them should not compete in the labor market. This argument is ancient and musty and in respects an economic fallacy. The belief is that people with private means ought not to work because they \"take the bread out of the mouth\" of those who are compelled to work for a living... It is instructive to note that five women councillors attended the meeting, but only two voted in favour of the woman doctor.The Women's Freedom League organised a protest meeting against the dismissal, held at the Working Men's College, with speakers including Louise McIlroy, Winifred Cullis, Helena Normanton, Agnes Dawson, and Leslie Burgin. The following year, St. Pancras appointed Dr. Stella Churchill to replace Miall-Smith. Helena Normanton, writing to The Woman's Leader, criticised this decision, noting that in hiring a widow 'St. Pancras has now obtained precisely what it wanted all along - a woman celibate.' Normanton believed that 'as long as Dr. Miall-Smith's shameful dismissal stands unredressed and unvindicated, so long do all women stand rebuked and humiliated; and the marriage state dishonoured.'
