During the First World War, he served as the Deputy Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion, Royal Newfoundland Regiment and as the unit's Acting Commanding Officer during the Battle of Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917. When he was 33 years old, and an acting lieutenant colonel in the 1st Battalion, The Border Regiment, during the First World War at the Battle of Estaires, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 11/12 April 1918 near Vieux-Berquin, France:\nFour times Lieutenant Colonel Forbes-Robertson saved the line from breaking and averted a most serious situation. On one occasion, having made a reconnaissance on horseback in full view of the enemy under heavy fire, he led a counter-attack which was completely successful in establishing our line. When his horse was shot under him he continued on foot, steadying the men and inspiring confidence by his disregard for personal danger. On the second day he lost another horse and again continued on foot until he had established a line to which his own troops could withdraw.In August 1918 he was given the temporary rank of brigadier general whilst he served as a staff officer, later reverting to his substantive rank. He later achieved the rank of colonel and transferred to the Gordon Highlanders where he ended his career.\nForbes-Robertson died in 1955 and was buried at the Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, Cheltenham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cheltenham College", "response": ["* Lieutenant Colonel James Forbes-Robertson (34)"]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|James Forbes-Robertson || British Army || 1918 || First World War || Vieux Berquin"]}, {"page": "James Forbes", "response": ["* James Forbes-Robertson (1884\u20131955), English recipient of the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I"]}, {"page": "Royal Newfoundland Regiment", "response": ["* Colonel James Forbes-Robertson, VC, DSO*, MC, DL"]}, {"page": "Border Regiment", "response": ["* Captain (Acting Lieutenant-Colonel) James Forbes-Robertson (11/12 April 1918)"]}, {"page": "Allied leaders of World War I", "response": ["*James Forbes-Robertson \u2013 Deputy Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, acting commander during the Battle of Monchy-le-Preux (part of the Battle of Arras)"]}, {"page": "Forbes-Robertson", "response": ["*James Forbes-Robertson VC, DSO & Bar, MC (1884\u20131955), Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "List of last stands", "response": ["|After a German counterattack at the village of Monchy-le-Preux, a desperate yet determined defence was mounted by a group of nine soldiers of the British Empire. This group consisted of one man from the Essex Regiment, and eight others from the Newfoundland Regiment, including Lieutenant Colonel James Forbes-Robertson, the leader of the defenders. Their goal being to prevent a force of some 300 Germans from advancing through the area and thus capturing Monchy, they held a position opposite the village's German-occupied assembly trench. The resistance offered by the group delayed the German force's relay of intelligence, concealing the truth of the defenders' inferior numbers. The nine men were eventually reinforced by a tenth soldier who had previously been knocked unconscious, and later by a group from the Hampshire Regiment. After hours of ceaseless fighting, the Germans were forced to retreat, having sustained over 40 casualties."]}, {"page": "1917 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Captain James Forbes-Robertson, Border Regiment"]}, {"page": "Forbes-Robertson, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Forbes-Robertson"]}, {"page": "Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, Cheltenham", "response": ["*Colonel James Forbes-Robertson V.C.
