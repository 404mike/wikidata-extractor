In 1928, he joined Elstree Studios and was an art director there until 1929 when he became a freelance illustrator. He was a prolific contributor to the Radio Times,  including the cover of at least one Christmas issue. In 1960 he designed the first Radio Times cover to mark the Eurovision Song Contest.The book Surrealism in England \u2013 1936 and After (1986) says of him:\n\n\"Victor Reinganum is Surrealist on the outside or not at all \u2013 Born London 1907 \u2013 Never a member of any Surrealist group, his work shared a certain terrain with Tunnard, a poetic abstraction on the frontiers of figuration often using biomorphic forms.
