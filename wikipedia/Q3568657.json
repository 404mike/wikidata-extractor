He had undergone surgery, and had been advised by Royal doctor William George Maton to cancel all forthcoming appointments, which included the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Huskisson chose to ignore this advice, believing the opening event too important to cancel.  He rode down the line in a special train constructed for the Duke of Wellington and his guests and dignitaries, pulled by the locomotive Northumbrian which was driven by George Stephenson himself. This train was the only train on the south track; the other seven were in procession on the northern track..  At Parkside railway station, near the midpoint of the line, the locomotives made a scheduled stop to take on fuel and water. Although the company had implicitly warned passengers to remain on the trains while this took place, around fifty of the dignitaries on board alighted when the Duke of Wellington's special train stopped. One of those who got off was Huskisson, who approached the Duke to take this opportunity to repair their relationship after a great falling out, which resulted in Huskisson leaving the government, and shook his hand."]}, {"page": "Harveian Oration", "response": ["*1815 William George Maton"]}, {"page": "Orcheston", "response": ["The parish gives its name to the 'Orcheston long grass' (Agrostis stolonifera), also called 'Creeping Bent', the most commonly used species of Agrostis.William George Maton, Observations on the Orcheston long grass in Transactions of the Linnean Society, v. 5 (1800), pp. 28-31William Bingley, Useful knowledge: or, A familiar account of the various productions of nature (1831) page 33 online at books.google.comWilliam Withering, An arrangement of British plants (1796) page 144 at books.google.com The Rough-Stalked Meadow Grass (Poa trivialis), is also called Orcheston Grass,Martin John Sutton, Permanent and Temporary Pastures (1929), p. 60 and in the early 19th century there was something of a controversy among botanists as to which was the true Orcheston Grass.'An Account of the Grasses and Produce of the Orcheston Meadow in Wiltshire, by "]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| William George Maton||26/06/1800||31 January 1774 \u2013 30 March 1835"]}, {"page": "Maton (surname)", "response": ["* William George Maton (1774\u20131835), English physician"]}, {"page": "George Leman Tuthill", "response": ["Tuthill was Gulstonian lecturer in 1818, and censor in 1819 and 1830.
