He soon attracted attention for his size\"six feet and thirteen and stamina. The Derby Daily Telegraph wrote that playing three matches in four days over the Christmas period had no ill effects, and commented that he was doing well at left half despite being better suited to the centre-half position. He was ever-present in league and FA Cup for the rest of the season, and played the last few matches in the centre. In 1922\u201323 he made only four appearances, and left the club at the end of the season."]}]}}
