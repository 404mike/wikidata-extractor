In 1833 he became a member of the Common Council of the City of London, and in 1835 was elected MP for Coventry.  After losing the seat in 1847, he became MP for Lambeth in 1850.\nAs a result of a speech made by Williams on 10 March 1846, a government inquiry into the state of education in Wales was launched, culminating in the \"Treachery of the Blue Books\".  In 1863 he chaired the meeting that launched the campaign for a University of Wales.\nWilliam Williams was a generous benefactor to the village of his birth, paying for the construction and furnishing of the village school in 1862.William Williams died on 26 April 1865, after falling from his horse in Hyde Park, London. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London, in a grave north-east of the main chapel, alongside his parliamentary friend Joseph Hume. A plaque is dedicated to him in the village school he founded in Llanpumsaint.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Williams", "response": ["William Williams may refer to:", "* William Williams (artist) (1727\u20131791), artist and author of American novel Penrose", "* William Williams (antiquary) (Gwilym Ddu o Arfon, 1739\u20131817), Welsh historian and poet", "* William Williams (Carw Coch) (1808\u20131872, bardic name Carw Coch), Welsh literary figure", "* William Williams (Creuddynfab) (1814\u20131869), Welsh poet and literary critic", "* William Williams (Crwys) (1875\u20131968, bardic name Crwys), Welsh-language poet", "* William Williams (soldier) (died 1814), soldier killed in defense of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812", "* William Williams (Medal of Honor) (1840\u20131893), Medal of Honor recipient of the American Civil War", "* William Williams (VC) (1890\u20131965), Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War", "* William Williams (Connecticut politician) (1731\u20131811), US Continental Congressman", "* William Williams (New York politician) (1815\u20131876), US Representative from New York", "* William Williams (Indiana politician) (1821\u20131896), US Representative from Indiana", "* William Williams (surgeon) (1856\u20131919), Surgeon General", "* William Williams (commissioner) (1862\u20131947), Commissioner of Immigration, Ellis Island", "* Sir William Williams, 6th Baronet (died 1696), Welsh politician", "* Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Gray's Inn (1634\u20131700), Welsh lawyer and politician, speaker of the House of Commons", "* Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet, of Gray's Inn (1665\u20131740), Welsh politician, Member of Parliament (MP) for Denbigh, 1708\u20131710", "* Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet, of Clapton (1730\u20131761), MP for New Shoreham, 1758\u20131751", "* William Williams (Radical politician) (1788\u20131865), Welsh businessman based in London, Radical MP 1835\u20131847 and 1850\u20131865", "* William Williams (Swansea MP) (1840\u20131904), British Member of Parliament for Swansea District 1893\u20131895", "* William Williams (Labour politician) (1895\u20131963), British civil servant and politician", "* William Williams (New South Wales politician) (1856\u20131947), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "* William Williams (Tasmanian politician) (1851\u20131924), member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council", "* William Williams (Archdeacon of Cashel) (fl. 17th century), Irish Anglican clergyman", "* William Williams of Wern (1781\u20131840), Welsh Independent minister, promoter of the General Union movement of 1834", "* William Williams (bishop) (1800\u20131878), bishop of Waiapu in New Zealand", "* William Williams (Caledfryn) (1801\u20131869), Welsh Congregational minister, poet and literary critic", "* William Williams (priest) (1848\u20131930), Dean of St David's, 1919\u20131931", "* William Williams (minister) (1848\u20131913), Australian Methodist minister and president-general of the Methodist Church of Australasia 1907\u20131910", "* William Williams (missionary) (1859\u20131892), Welsh missionary to East Khasi Hills, India", "* William Williams (footballer) (1856\u2013?), Welsh international footballer in the 1870s and 1880s", "* William Williams (footballer, born 1892) (1892\u20131926), English footballer", "* William Williams (rugby union) (1866\u20131945), Welsh rugby union footballer in the 1880s and 1890s", "* William Williams (Halifax RLFC) (20th century), Welsh rugby league footballer in the 1900s and 1910s", "* J.

The secretary of the government's Committee of the Privy Council on Education at the time was James Kay-Shuttleworth, a man who held the view that the solution to the poor conditions suffered by labouring classes lay in improved education. Kay-Shuttleworth's guidelines on selecting the commissioners to conduct the inquiry was that they were to \"examine the whole question with impartiality\", be \"laymen of the Church of England\", \"accustomed to statistical inquiries\", and \"capable of analysing the opinions on social, political and religious questions which may be presented to them, and of diffusing juster views among all classes\". The commissioners appointed by the Privy Council's committee on education, were three young English law graduates; Ralph Lingen, Jelinger C. Symons, and . The commissioners visited every part of Wales during 1846, collecting evidence and statistics. They spoke no Welsh, but it was generally the army of Welsh-speaking assistant commissioners, who were also appointed, who visited the schools, villages, and towns. Schools attended by children from the higher and middle classes were out of scope of the inquiry, so were not included in the survey. The evidence collected from Anglican witnesses was treated seriously whilst that from Nonconformists may have been ignored. This was a time when Wales was a stronghold of Nonconformism."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Lambeth(two members)||William Williams||Radical"]}, {"page": "Lambeth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"5\"| William Williams"]}, {"page": "Llanpumsaint", "response": ["*William Williams (1788-1865) Welsh businessman based in London, Radical MP 1835\u20131847 and 1850\u20131865"]}, {"page": "Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Williams"]}, {"page": "1865 in Wales", "response": ["*26 April \u2014 William Williams, MP, 77"]}, {"page": "1846 in Wales", "response": ["*March - A speech by William Williams, MP for Coventry, on the subject of education and the Welsh language leads to the commissioning of a report."]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|||William Williams||1788||1865 (fall from horse)||Radical||Coventry (1835\u201347), Lambeth (1850-death)||"]}, {"page": "Joseph Edwards (sculptor)", "response": ["In 1837, Edwards became a student at the Royal Academy of Arts where he won several prizes for his work.
