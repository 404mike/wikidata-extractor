In 1850 for Thames Club he won the Diamond Challenge Sculls again. That year, he was asked to enter an event at Bath regatta in order to make a race of it. However, because there was a \u00a310 prize attached to it, he was criticised by the Wingfield Sculls committee. For this reason, Playford objected to racing Bone in the Wingfield Sculls so Bone, representing Meteor Club, won on a row-over. He rowed over again in 1851  for Thames Club but resigned in 1852 because he could not find a backer.Bone died at Fulham  aged 67.\nBone married at St James Westminster in 1850.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Diamond Challenge Sculls", "response": ["| 1849 || Thomas Bone || London || C S Bagot", "| 1850 || Thomas Bone || Meteor Club, London || John Erskine Clarke"]}, {"page": "Francis Playford", "response": ["Playford was born at South Lambeth, London and was part of a rowing family which included his brother Herbert Playford.
