That's people like me they're talking about.' Moms can keep guys connected at the concrete level as opposed to the abstract.' \" [p 230 Lombardi, likewise, hints that \"guys\" will perceive their own \"moms\" in the collegiate young women's clubhouse appearance, genteel manner, and \"angelic voices\" as an altogether unthinkable target of lewd misogyny [pp 229\u2013230]. For reference, here is the Lombardi book's full treatment of the song: \"The Barnard College a cappella group posted their rendition of hip-hop superstar Dr. Dre's song 'Bitches Ain't Shit' on YouTube. Dressed in pink, the young women's angelic voices rise in harmony, gently singing the lyrics 'Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks. Lick on these nuts and suck the dick.' Those are actually some of the milder lyrics, and the incongruity of hearing the incredibly misogynistic words coming sweetly out of these college students' mouths makes its point. 'What moms can say to their sons is, \"Hey, have you ever actually listened to this lyric?\" ' Michael Kimmel says. 'That's people like me they're talking about.' Moms can keep guys connected at the concrete level as opposed to the abstract.' \" [pp 229\u2013230] Thus, besides Lombardi's syntax that strictly, but trivially, states that the women's voices are dressed in pink, she may overlook that the choir covers only the Ben Folds version, whose most harshly misogynous lyrics she quotes when suggesting that the choir also sings the Dr. Dre song's more harshly misogynous lyrics. At such recurrent mixup, Folds elsewhere clarifies, \"That song is like a six-minute-long misogynistic rant that never stops, and I took most of that stuff out\" [Chris Steffen, \"Ben Folds on repeating mistakes, conjuring characters, and repeating mistakes\", AllMusic.com, Netaktion LLC, 23 Aug 2019].

In the video below, a Columbia University a cappella group sings Dr. Dre's 'Bitches Ain't Shit.' The appropriation of the song works on so many levels: the all- heavily-white, all-female group, the sweet choral arrangement, the pastel prep fashion, the strategically placed tennis rackets. They use race, class, and gender contradictions to force us to see and hear the song in a new way.

Despite some disputing that feminism ever declined and resurged, the fourth wave is distinguished by its internet basis, massive popularity, and being \"inherently intersectional\" [Constance Grady, \"The waves of feminism, and why people keep fighting over them, explained\", Vox.com, Vox Media, LLC, 20 Jul 2018]. Feminist discourse, planning, and even activism, like #MeToo tweets, are mainly online, while the Women's March was \"conceived and propagated online\" [Ibid.]. So it is often dated to 2008, when Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and feminist blogs like Jezebel and Feministing were well in place, and fourth wave was well recognized by 2013 [Ibid.] That year, Kira Cochrane glossed the first wave's apex in the 1910s via voting rights, the second wave's \"liberation movement that blazed through the 1970s and '80s\", and \"the third wave declared by Rebecca Walker\", daughter of the 1983 novel The Color Purple's author Alice Walker, and by others in the early 1990s, \"with women defining their work as distinct from their mothers' \" [\"The fourth wave of feminism: meet the rebel women\", TheGuardian.com, 10 Dec 2013]. Cochrane found it \"feels like something new again\", a \"reactive movement\" of \"startling\" popularity, enabled by new technology [Ibid.] Yet, more realistically, by the 1980, the second wave had splintered, as radical feminism, including its offshot cultural feminism, along with socialist feminism, which is radical plus Marxist and largely is black feminism, opposed liberal feminism, the mainstream of mostly white women of middle class who endorsed liberalist values of individualism, capitalism, and the sexual revolution. Near 1990, poststructural feminism reexplained gender not as causing but instead as caused by culture as structured by language, and femaleness was displaced from the center of feminism, which then developed radical queer and critical race theories [Sam Warner, \"Structuralism, feminist approaches to\", in Nancy A.

There, he prefaced, \"I think, really, what it is, because someone dresses a certain way\u2014and may appear sleazy to some people\u2014this is, in fact, their culture, and should be respected. And so, you've got this sort of upper-middle-class douchebag, comes in, and thinks that he can just take advantage of Kesha because of her style.

For example, when the 1995 book The Rules appeared, it touched off media controversy about how men and women should relate to each other, with different positions taken by columnist Maureen Dowd of The New York Times and British writer Kira Cochrane of The Guardian and others. It has even caused anthropologists such as Helen Fisher to suggest that dating is a game designed to \"impress and capture\" which is not about \"honesty\" but \"novelty\", \"excitement\" and even \"danger\", which can boost dopamine levels in the brain. The subject of dating has spun off popular culture terms such as the friend zone which refers to a situation in which a dating relation evolves into a platonic non-sexual union.", "One report suggested the United States as well as other western-oriented countries were different from the rest of the world because \"love is the reason for mating,\" as opposed to marriages being arranged to cement economic and class ties between families and promote political stability. Dating, by mutual consent of two single people, is the norm. British writer Kira Cochrane, after moving to the U.S., found herself grappling with the American approach to dating. She wondered why it was acceptable to juggle \"10 potential partners\" while weighing different attributes; she found American-style dating to be \"exhausting and strange.\" She found dating in America to be \"organized in a fairly formal fashion\" with men approaching women and asking point blank for a date; she found this to be \"awkward.\" She described the \"third date rule\" which was that women weren't supposed to have sex until the third date even if they desired it, although men were supposed to try for sex. She wrote: \"Dating rules almost always cast the man as aggressor, and the woman as prey, which frankly makes me feel nauseous.\" Canadian writer Danielle Crittenden, however, chronicling female angst, criticized a tendency not to take dating seriously and suggested that postponing marriage into one's thirties was problematic:", "In Britain, the term dating bears similarity to the American sense of the tentative exploratory part of a relationship. If two people are going out together, it may mean they're dating but that their relationship has advanced to a relatively long-standing and sexual boyfriend-girlfriend relationship although they're not cohabiting. Although Britons are familiar with the term dating, the rituals surrounding courtship are somewhat different from those commonly found in North America. Writer Kira Cochrane advises daters to \"get out there and meet people\" while noting a trend of temporary suspension of marriage until an individual reaches his or her thirties. She sees a trend for developing new ways of meeting people. In contrast, writer Bibi van der Zee found dating etiquette rules to be helpful, and found that supposedly liberated advice such as \"just be yourself\" to be the \"most useless advice in history.\" She expresses frustration following fruitless sexual relationships, and that her mid twenties saw dating relationships with partners who were less willing to return phone calls or display interest in long-term commitment. She felt \"clueless and unwanted\", she wrote, and found advice books such as The Rules helpful. British writer Henry Castiglione signed up for a \"weekend flirting course\" and found the experience helpful; he was advised to talk to and smile at everyone he met. Emailing back-and-forth, after meeting on a dating website, is one way to get to know people in Britain, and elsewhere. In the UK, one estimate from 2009 is that 15 million people are single, and half of these are seeking a long-term relationship; three-quarters of them have not been in a relationship for more than 18 months. In a twelve-month period, the average number of dates that a single person will have is four. When dating, 43% of people google their dates ahead of time. Almost five million Britons visited a dating website in the past twelve months. A third admitting to lying on their profile. A fifth of married individuals between 19 and 25 met their spouse online. One poll in 2009 of 3,000 couples suggested that the average duration of their courtship period, between first meeting to the acceptance of a marriage proposal, was three years. In 2017 Britain online dating fraud victim numbers at record high. According to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, there were 3,889 victims of so-called romance fraud last year who handed over a record \u00a339m.
