His appointment was confirmed on 17 July. Sheffield Wednesday however stated there were still outstanding legal issues with Bruce having resigned just 48 hours before, leading a report being filed to the Premier League alleging misconduct in his appointment. Newcastle United denied any wrongdoing and stated they were confident no case could be escalated. Reaction from the fans was mixed, with some feeling Bruce would not achieve the standard set by Ben\u00edtez, whilst his recent lack of Premier League football and management of rival club Sunderland proved controversial. Bruce later acknowledged Ben\u00edtez's popularity and stated he hoped the fans would not rush to judgement and give him time to prove himself and manager of Newcastle. Due to visa problems in China, Bruce watched his first match as manager from the stands which saw Newcastle achieve a third-place finish in the pre-season 2019 Premier League Asia Trophy following a 1\u20130 victory over West Ham United F.C. Bruce quickly made his first transfer, signing Joelinton from TSG 1899 Hoffenheim for \u00a340 million, breaking the club's transfer fee record previously held by Miguel Almir\u00f3n at \u00a321 million just 6 months before, before signing French international winger Allan Saint-Maximin from OGC Nice on a permanent deal for \u00a316.5 million, Sweden international defender Emil Krafth for \u00a35 million, central midfielder Kyle Scott on a free signing following his departure from Chelsea, and Netherlands international defender Jetro Willems on loan from Frankfurt F.C until the end of the 2019\u201320 season. Bruce made his final transfer of the pre-season on deadline day by re-signing striker Andy Carroll, who had left the club over 7 years earlier. On 4 February 2020, Steve Bruce's side ended a 14-year drought by reaching the 5th Round of the FA Cup they beat League One side Oxford United 2\u20133 in a replay thanks to a late winner from Allan Saint-Maximin in extra time.
