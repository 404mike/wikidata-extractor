She was gifted money by the local British Chamber of Commerce and made an honorary officer in the Brazilian Air Force, which also presented her a trophy, \"The Spirit of Aviation\". She then flew onto Argentina and Uruguay and while in Buenos Aires, she received an offer from Charles Lindbergh to make a lecture tour of the United States. She declined, opting instead to return to England. According to Peggy Kelman, an Australian aviatrix of the 1930s interviewed by Mackersey, Batten had written to her mother for permission to take the tour but this was not forthcoming and she was ordered to go back to England. She arrived at Southampton on 23 December aboard the RMS Asturias, the  Gull in its hold. In her autobiography, Batten makes no mention of Lindberg's offer, noting that she wanted to be in London for Christmas.", "Batten returned to England in April 1970 but shortly after her arrival was invited to Australia as a guest at a fundraising banquet. The flight there and back would be provided at no cost by Qantas, and she promptly availed herself of the invitation. In Australia, she resumed some of her acquaintances, some of whom noted that she talked of little but her record breaking flights rather than more recent events in her life. However, Peggy Kelman, the Australian aviator who had met Batten in the 1930s, later described conversations in which Batten conceded that her life had been dominated by her mother. Kelman also flew a light aircraft with Batten as a passenger, and offered her the controls; Batten steadfastly declined. She ended up staying in Australia for nearly three months, travelling across the country at the expense of Qantas and being hosted for free. Eventually, tired from her visit, she asked for a flight to Fiji to recuperate before going onto the United States. There she did a tour at the behest of the Ninety-Nines, an association of female pilots, before returning to Tenerife in October."]}, {"page": "Ninety-Nines", "response": ["* Peggy Kelman"]}, {"page": "Buderim", "response": ["* Peggy Kelman, OBE Australian pioneer aviator, died in Buderim"]}, {"page": "Kincoppal School", "response": ["* Peggy Kelman OBE, Australian pioneer aviator"]}, {"page": "Kelman", "response": ["* Peggy Kelman, Australian pioneer aviator"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 1998", "response": ["*Peggy Kelman, 89, Australian aviation pioneer."]}]}}
