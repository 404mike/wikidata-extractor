Though it was a review of his uncle's Remorse, he connects the intention and imagery found within Coleridge's poem to that in Ode: Intimation of Immortality and John Wilson's \"To a Sleeping Child\" when saying, \"To an extension or rather a modification of this last mentioned principle [obedience to some internal feeling] may perhaps be attributed the beautiful tenet so strongly inculcated by them of the celestial purity of infancy. 'Heaven lies about us in our infancy,' says Mr. Wordsworth, in a passage which strikingly exemplifies the power of imaginative poetry\".Woof 2001 qtd. p. 241 John Taylor Coleridge returned to Wordsworth's poetry and the ode in a May 1815 review for the British Critic. In the review, he partially condemns Wordsworth's emphasis in the ode on children being connected to the divine: \"His occasional lapses into childish and trivial allusion may be accounted for, from the same tendency. He is obscure, when he leaves out links in the chain of association, which the reader cannot easily supply... In his descriptions of children this is particularly the case, because of his firm belief in a doctrine, more poetical perhaps, than either philosophical or christian, that 'Heaven lies about us in our infancy.'\"Woof 2001 p. 455", "John Taylor Coleridge continues by explaining the negative aspects of such a concept: \"Though the tenderness and beauty resulting from this opinion be to us a rich overpayment for the occasional strainings and refinements of sentiment to which it has given birth, it has yet often served to make the author ridiculous in common eyes, in that it has led him to state his own fairy dreams as the true interpretation and import of the looks and movements of children, as being even really in their minds.\" In a February 1821 review for the British Critic, John Taylor Coleridge attacked the poem again for a heretical view found in the notion of pre-existence and how it reappeared in Wordsworth's poem \"On an Extraordinary Evening of Splendour and Beauty\".Woof 2001 pp. 794\u2013795 However, he does claim that the passage of the ode containing the idea is \"a passage of exquisite poetry\" and that \"A more poetical theory of human nature cannot well be devised, and if the subject were one, upon which error was safe, we should forbear to examine it closely, and yield to the delight we have often received from it in the ode from which the last extract [Ode: Intimations of Immortality] is made.\"Woof 2001 qtd. p. 807 He was to continue: \"If, therefore, we had met the doctrine in any poet but Mr. Wordsworth, we should have said nothing; but we believe him to be one not willing to promulgate error, even in poetry, indeed it is manifest that he makes his poetry subservient to his philosophy; and this particular notion is so mixed up by him with others, in which it is impossible to suppose him otherwise than serious; that we are constrained to take it for his real and sober belief.\""]}, {"page": "John Coleridge", "response": ["* John Taylor Coleridge (1790\u20131876), English judge"]}, {"page": "List of coupled cousins", "response": ["| Bernard Coleridge, 2nd Baron Coleridge || Mary Mackarness || 3 August 1876|| John Taylor Coleridge and Mary Buchanan"]}, {"page": "John Mackarness", "response": ["He married Alethea Buchanan Coleridge on 7 August 1849 at Ottery Saint Mary, Devon, daughter of Sir John Taylor Coleridge.
