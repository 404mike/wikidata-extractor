The comic performer Sacha Baron Cohen referred to Sellers as \"the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy\". Cohen was considered for the role of Sellers in the biographical film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. Will Ferrell considers Sellers to be an important influence on him, citing his \"unique combination of being extremely subtle and over-the-top all at the same time.\" The three members of Spinal Tap\u2014Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer\u2014have also cited Sellers as being an influence on them, as has the US talk-show host Conan O'Brien.
