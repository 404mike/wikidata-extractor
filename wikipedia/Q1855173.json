He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. Marcus Stone, illustrator of Our Mutual Friend, recalled that the author was always \"ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and\u00a0... life-history of the creations of his fancy\".. Dickens employs Cockney English in many of his works, denoting working-class Londoners. Cockney grammar appears in terms such as ain't, and consonants in words are frequently omitted, as in 'ere (here) and wot (what). An example of this usage is in Oliver Twist. The Artful Dodger uses cockney slang which is juxtaposed with Oliver's 'proper' English, when the Dodger repeats Oliver saying \"seven\" with \"sivin\"."]}, {"page": "Edward II of England", "response": ["Edward's life has also been used in a wide variety of other media. In the Victorian era, the painting Edward\u00a0II and Piers Gaveston by Marcus Stone strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit. It was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872 but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive. More recently, the director David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet Edward\u00a0II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward\u00a0II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th\u00a0century."]}, {"page": "Art colony", "response": ["* The Holland Park Circle, Holland Park, West London (George Frederic Watts, Frederic Leighton, Val Prinsep, Luke Fildes, William Burges, Hamo Thornycroft, Marcus Stone, William Holman Hunt)"]}, {"page": "Our Mutual Friend", "response": ["Our Mutual Friend, like most Dickens novels, was published in monthly instalments.

Dickens chose instead the younger Marcus Stone and, uncharacteristically, left much of the illustrating process to Stone's discretion. After suggesting only a few slight alterations for the cover, for instance, Dickens wrote to Stone: \"All perfectly right. Alterations quite satisfactory. Everything very pretty\".Storey, Graham, ed.

It was the second of two houses in Melbury Road designed by Shaw, the first, 8 Melbury Road, was designed for another painter Marcus Stone. Fildes and Stone were artistic rivals and each naturally regarded their own Shaw-designed house as superior. Of the construction of Woodland House Fildes wrote in November 1876 that \"The house is getting on famously and looks stunning\u00a0... It is a long way the most superior house of the whole lot; I consider it knocks Stone's to fits, though of course he wouldn't have that by what I hear he says of his, but my opinion is the universal one.\" Fildes moved into the house in October 1877 and it remained his home until his death there in February 1927.*  In 1959 the London County Council commemorated Fildes at Woodland House with a blue plaque.", "Shaw had prepared preliminary designs of Woodland House by August 1875, and building began early in 1876, with construction being undertaken by W.

Shaw was well acquainted with members of the art establishment, being friends with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris and Philip Webb.Dakers 1999, p. 157. The choice by Fildes and Stone of Richard Norman Shaw as the architect of their houses was an important symbol of their ambition to become academicians, members of the Royal Academy of Arts, and of the art establishment themselves.Dakers 1999, p. 158. The imposing houses and studios that Shaw designed would impress potential patrons. The house is next to the home of George Frederick Watts, and backs on to the garden of the Leighton House Museum, the former \"studio-home\" of Frederic, Lord Leighton.
