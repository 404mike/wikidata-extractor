A good club man, known for technique and work rate, Johnson started the epic 2001 Heineken Cup Final against Stade Francais, breaking his arm and being replaced by Paul Gustard. The following year he was an unused replacement as Leicester retained the trophy. Johnson played seven times for England A but never made the break through to international level, in a similar fashion to another Leicester back rower John Wells.\nJohnson joined Coventry R.F.C. in July 2006 and was made club captain, but left in December of that year to join Italian side Benetton Treviso. Since then he has moved on to captain Rugby Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur where he plays alongside Dan Luger and Kevin Yates.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Martin Corry (rugby union)", "response": ["2000\u201301 season saw Corry again be a regular member of Leicester pack, switching between flanker and number 8 with Will Johnson, he played 30 times as Tigers retained the Premiership Rugby title for a third straight year.
