Her name commemorated his attack on the port of Sidon in 1840 during the Syrian War.  Her keel was laid down on 26 May 1845 at Deptford Dockyard, and she was launched on 26 May 1846.  She had a fairly short career for a warship, but it included the rescue of the crew of the sinking Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation vessel Ariel on 28 May 1848, and a trip up the Nile that same year, when her passengers included the explorer and botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker.  She served in the Black Sea during the Crimean War, 1854\u201355 under the command of Captain George Goldsmith. In April 1854, in company with HMS Firebrand (Captain William Houston Stewart), she blockaded the coast from Kavarna to the mouths of the River Danube.Russian War, 1854, Baltic and Black Sea, Official Correspondence edited by D. Bonner-Smith and Captain A. C. Dewar, Navy Records Society, 1943, pp. 245\u20136, 251\u20132. In September, during the actual Allied invasion of the Crimea, she was assigned to escorting the French troop transports, and assisted the French line-of-battleship Algiers, which had gone aground in Eupatoria Bay.Russian War, 1854, Baltic and Black Sea, Official Correspondence pp. 310\u201311.

On October 8 the Livadia sailed into the Bay of Biscay and was soon caught in a violent storm.Andrienko 1994, p. 33. According to Reed, sailing straight into the storm to test the ship was Constantine's idea and that no Russian dared to argue. Waves of six to seven meters failed to upset the Livadia: transverse roll did not exceed 3.5 degrees, longitudinal pitch was within 5.5 degrees.Andrienko 1994, p. 34. Stewart praised the comfort of the Livadia: \"I never was in so comfortable a ship at sea in a gale of wind ... the absence of rolling, the easiness of motion, the great comfort on board, and the handiness of steering, were such as I have never seen before in any other ship under similar circumstances of weather and sea\"."]}, {"page": "1887 Golden Jubilee Honours", "response": ["*Admiral Sir William Houston Stewart KCB"]}, {"page": "1877 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Rear-Admiral William Houston Stewart "]}, {"page": "Admiral-superintendent, Portsmouth", "response": ["* Rear-Admiral William Houston Stewart, November 1871\u2013April 1872"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Navy admirals (1707\u2013current)", "response": ["|Sir William Houston Stewart GCB"]}, {"page": "Commander-in-Chief, Devonport", "response": ["*1881 \u2013 1884 Admiral Sir William Houston Stewart."]}]}}
