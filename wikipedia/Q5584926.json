Birds filmed live on their nests included swallows, buzzards, jays, barn owls and jackdaws. Oddie had close encounters with an otter and a kingfisher on the River Torridge, which runs through the farm. Simon King travelled to the Hebridean island of Islay, where he filmed local specialities such as red-billed choughs, corncrakes, hen harriers, golden eagles and common shelducks. The series also featured barn owl chicks at Cornwall's Lost Gardens of Heligan, and cameras captured the moment when one chick killed and ate its younger sibling. Gordon Buchanan filmed urban red foxes in Glasgow for a pre-recorded nightly diary segment.", "The week after the main series ended, four Springwatch Specials were screened. Humble presented a programme on marine life, Oddie looked at garden wildlife, King focussed on spectacular British wildlife events and Gordon Buchanan met people who have interesting relationships with wildlife.", "Springwatch returned for its fifth series, broadcast from 25 May to 11 June 2009. Bill Oddie, who had left the programme for personal health reasons, was replaced as the series' co-anchor by Chris Packham. He joined Kate Humble for the show's second year based at Pensthorpe. Simon King toured locations across north and mid-Wales, viewing Anglesey's seabird colonies, goshawks and red kites. His main challenge was to find and film a wild polecat. Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan was based at a badger sett in Essex. Former producer Martin Hughes-Games also joined the team to present a regular feature on conservation holidays, as well as co-hosting the spin-off Springwatch Unsprung programmes. The Springwatch website continued to host regularly updated blogs, message boards and webcams, as well as wildlife information. Over the course of the series, Packham privately set himself the challenge of inserting the titles of songs by The Smiths into the script for each episode.", "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 series, starting on 25 May, did not come from a central base. Instead each presenter appeared from a location near their home, respecting government guidelines on social distancing. Packham \u2013 joined occasionally by his step-daughter Megan McCubbin, a zoologist \u2013 was in the New Forest, Williams in Montgomeryshire, and Burke in Cornwall. Although she sent a video message from her home in South Africa, Strachan was unable to return to the UK to participate. Steve Backshall was guest presenter during the first week, from his home on the Thames, with Gordon Buchanan, presenting from Loch Lomond National Park in week two, and Ellie Harrison in the Golden Valley, near Stroud, in week three.", "For 2006, Autumnwatch was extended to a two-week series, broadcast from 2\u201312 October. Oddie and Kate Humble were based at Martin Mere wetland reserve in Lancashire, where they awaited the arrival of local wild swans and the return of the brent geese to Northern Island. King watched the red deer rut on the island of R\u00f9m. In addition, cameraman Gordon Buchanan filmed a nightly grey seal diary from the Monarch Islands. British viewers could submit their sightings of natural autumn events on the Autumnwatch website, and the findings were developed into an online map showing the progression of autumn events across the country. This showed a correlation with temperature. Much like with Springwatch, a spin-off show for CBeebies aired, titled CBeebies Autumnwatch.", "For Autumnwatch 2008, broadcast from 27 October \u2013 6 November, Oddie and Humble were based at Brownsea Island, one of the few places in southern England where red squirrels can still be seen. King visited a variety of locations around the country, beginning with three days watching fallow deer at Petworth Park and muntjac at Birmingham Airport. He then followed up sightings of otters in a Walsall canal, but although his team found traces of the animals, they didn't manage to film them. During the second week he watched ravens on Anglesey and made two live dives off the south coast of England, managing to find and film a conger eel. Gordon Buchanan travelled to the Farne Islands to film the grey seal colony during the pupping season. Attempts to communicate with Oddie and Humble via a live satellite link, were thwarted on several occasions by bad weather conditions.", "A one-off, hour-long Winterwatch was broadcast by the BBC on 22 February 2012, presented from the Brecon Beacons by Kate Humble, Chris Packham, and Martin Hughes-Games, with filmed segments by Charlie Hamilton James, Maya Plass, Gordon Buchanan, Michaela Strachan and Chris Watson.", "Following Simon King's departure in 2010, the role of field reporter was filled by various guest presenters; notably Gordon Buchanan, Charlie Hamilton James, Iolo Williams, Liz Bonnin and Michaela Strachan. He was eventually replaced by Gillian Burke seven years later."]}, {"page": "Nature documentary", "response": ["* Gordon Buchanan"]}, {"page": "Buchanan (surname)", "response": ["* Robert Gordon Buchanan (born 1961), retired Major League Baseball pitcher", "* Gordon Buchanan, Scottish wildlife film maker"]}, {"page": "BBC Natural History Unit filmography", "response": ["| The Bear Family & Me || 2011 ||  Follow with wildlife cameraman - Gordon Buchanan, as he tries to gain the trust of a wild bear family in a spectacular American wilderness. || Gordon Buchanan (presenter) || Yes || Yes", "| Land of the Lost Wolves || 2012 || Two-part natural history series following the fortunes of one very special pack of wolves as they return to North America's West Coast. || Gordon Buchanan (presenter) || No || No", "| The Dark: Nature's Nighttime World || 2012 || An expedition team films nocturnal creatures in Central and South America. || Andy Serkis (narrator), Gordon Buchanan (presenter), George McGavin (presenter) and Justine Evans (presenter) || Yes || Yes", "| The Polar Bear Family & Me || 2013 || Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan follows a wild polar bear family over three seasons in Svalbard. || Gordon Buchanan (presenter) || No || Yes", "| Wild Burma: Nature's Lost Kingdom || 2013 || Scientists and film-makers travel to Burma to survey endangered wildlife, the first such expedition in 50 years. || Paterson Joseph (narrator), Gordon Buchanan (presenter), Ross Piper (presenter), Justine Evans (presenter) || No || No", "| Snow Wolf Family & Me|| 2014 || Gordon Buchanan travels to the remote Canadian Arctic in search of wolves that have never seen people. || Gordon Buchanan (presenter) || No || Yes", "| Gorilla Family & Me|| 2015 || Gordon Buchanan travels to the Democratic Republic of Congo to meet a family of rare  Grauer's gorillas. || Gordon Buchanan (presenter) || No || Yes", "| Into the Wild || 2016 || Gordon Buchanan takes some of our best-loved household names on a wildlife adventure where they get up close and personal with some of the UK's most iconic species.|| Gordon Buchanan (presenter) || No || Yes", "| Animal Babies || 2016 || Three-part series follows young animals as they take their first steps and face their earliest challenges. || Gordon Buchanan (narrator) || No || No", "| Elephant Family & Me|| 2016 || Gordon Buchanan follows a herd of elephants in the Kenyan wilderness. || Gordon Buchanan (presenter) || No || No", "| Tribes, Predators & Me || 2017 || Gordon Buchanan follows the world's most remote tribes to observe how they live alongside nature's most deadly predators.
