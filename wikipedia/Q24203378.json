AEGIS campaigned to improve the care of older people in long-stay wards of National Health Service (NHS) psychiatric hospitals. In 1967, Robb compiled Sans Everything: A Case to Answer, a controversial book detailing the inadequacies of care provided for older people, which prompted a nationwide scandal. Although initially official inquiries into these allegations reported that they were \"totally unfounded or grossly exaggerated\", her campaigns led to revealing of other instances of ill treatment which were accepted and prompted the government to implement NHS policy changes.", "link_mentions": {}}}
