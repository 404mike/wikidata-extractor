This prompted Partick Thistle to invite him back to Firhill as trainer/coach to the first team.

However, in the 32nd minute, Dowds and Christie carved open the Rangers defence, Christie passed to Sammy Reid who blasted it past Martin in off the post.  Two minutes later, Christie had a golden chance to make it 2\u20130 but his half-hit shot was comfortably saved by Martin.

In the 65th minute following a collision with Jock Wallace, Willie Johnston was stretchered off with a broken leg. Johnston was substituted in the 66th minute by Davie Wilson, who had scored 3 goals against Berwick Rangers when they met in 1960. Despite frantic attempts from Wilson, Greig and George McLean, they were unable to penetrate the Berwick goal. It wasn't all one way traffic however, Berwick's Alan Ainslie forced Norrie Martin into a fine save and also hit the post.  Legend has it that in the 94th minute, Greig had asked referee Eddie Thomson for another couple of minutes but was told \"I've already given you four\".
