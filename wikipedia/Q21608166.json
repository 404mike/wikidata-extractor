So he had to pre-record the father's dialogue on the 15\u00a0inch disks used at that time, and leave gaps for the son's character to speak. After much careful rehearsal, the broadcast went out live, with naturalistic speech overlaps."]}, {"page": "The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter", "response": ["\"The Missing Three-Quarter\" was adapted by Felix Felton as a 1955 radio production for the BBC Home Service, as part of the 1952\u20131969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Felton as Lord Mount-James and Ronald Simpson as Dr Leslie Armstrong.
