Since Briggs was himself a professional musician, he was considered by other musicians to have a particular sensitivity, when arranging and producing for them.For example, shortly before his death, in a 2011 interview prior to the reissue of Close, which had been produced and arranged by Briggs, Sean Bonniwell commented as follows:  \"Vic Briggs did a great job producing me.  I'd go over to his house in the Canyon, and I'd sing the songs we were gonna record the next day. He'd sit right down and notate that thing, orchestrate it. I said, 'I want French horns here and so forth and so on, and maybe this little theme.' And that guy just, man, he zipped it down. He said, 'Oh yeah, this is gonna sound good, this is gonna sound good.' It was a wonderful experience, a wonderful collaboration.  He understood what I was going after perfectly, and allowed me a free hand in the studio as well. If something wasn't quite working, I'd say, 'Let's try this. Let's try something completely different.' Sometimes he'd say, 'Well, this is gonna work,' and I'd say, 'Well, no, it's not going where it should go to get to the end.' So he'd say, 'Okay, where are you going, what do you want to do?'\" Richie Unterberger, Interview with Sean Bonniwell (2011), contained in Liner Notes for T.S. Bonniwell's Close; richieunterberger.com.  Retrieved 9 May 2017.  In another 2011 interview, Bonniwell commented further, as follows: \"Vic was a godsend.  He insisted I sing and play the songs live for him, two or three at a time, in the late afternoon, near dusk, at his hillside cottage in the Canyon. Basically, he took it from there. As we progressed, so did our collaboration. However, a number of compositions were prearranged: 'Where Am I To Go' and 'Something To Be' are two examples of songs where the rhythm section was rehearsed with players of my choosing. In fact, Vic left me alone to 'school' the contract players in this way as well, in the studio, while he kept busy setting the sound and mix. When the basic tracks were satisfactory, he added the orchestration. To say we were on the same page is an understatement. It was a wonderful experience. I dare say it transformed both of us.\"  Peter Sjoblom interview with Sean Bonniwell; Bonniwell Music Machine.  Retrieved 2017-05-10.  Musicians chosen by Bonniwell and contracted by Briggs included Jim Gordon on drums and Lyle Ritz, a member of The Wrecking Crew, on bass. In May 1969, he became a staff producer and arranger at Capitol Records.  During this period, he arranged and produced albums by Danny McCulloch, Zoot Money, Hilton Valentine and Sean Bonniwell, among others.  None of the albums were successful, which Briggs attributed in part to the lack of support by the record company for new artists.  An album was required to succeed on its own, independently of record company support.  Bonniwell and his music, including the album produced and arranged by Briggs, later achieved a level of cult status.Editorial Review: T.S. Bonniwell, Close;Amazon.com.
