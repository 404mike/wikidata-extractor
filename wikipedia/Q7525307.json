In 2000, she joined Robin Guthrie (formerly of Cocteau Twins) to form Violet Indiana, which varies from shimmery wall of sound style with similarities to dreampop, to sparse single-guitar songs with less effects.\n\nSiobhan has a sensual, ethereal voice,\nand she is the fifth child of The Shadows drummer Tony Meehan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mono (UK band)", "response": ["The band, formed in late 1996 in London, consisted of singer Siobhan de Mar\u00e9 and Martin Virgo on keyboards, synthesizer programming, and production. Virgo, trained in classical piano at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, had been working as a session musician since the early 1990s as part of the production team of Nellee Hooper, which led to credits on a remix of Massive Attack's \"Unfinished Sympathy\" (considered one of the landmark songs of trip hop's \"Bristol sound\") and Bj\u00f6rk's 1993 album Debut. De Mar\u00e9 comes from a family with several generations of history in entertainment; her father was Tony Meehan, drummer for the Shadows, her grandfather was one of the Gongmen featured in the opening logo sequences in Rank Organisation films, and her grandmother was a dancer who worked with Shirley Bassey. She had been working as a session singer for hip hop and R&B musicians, as well as writing and touring, though much of this material consisted of underground and white label releases.
