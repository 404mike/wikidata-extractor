Born into a poor farming family in Derbyshire, Mitchell left home at a young age to work as a seamstress in Bolton, where she became involved in the socialist movement. She worked for many years in organisations related to socialism, women's suffrage and pacifism. After World War I she was elected to Manchester City Council and worked as a magistrate, before later working for Labour Party leader, Keir Hardie.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 22", "response": ["*1956 \u2013 Hannah Mitchell, English activist (b. 1872)"]}, {"page": "1956", "response": ["* October 22 \u2013 Hannah Mitchell, English socialist and suffragette (b. 1872)"]}, {"page": "1872", "response": ["* February 11 \u2013 Hannah Mitchell, English socialist, suffragette (d. 1956)"]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1800\u20131874||data-sort-value=\"Mitchell, Hannah\"|Hannah Mitchell||United Kingdom||1872||1956||Socialist feminist; suffragette||"]}, {"page": "Ellen Wilkinson", "response": ["Teaching was one of the few careers then open to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of \u00a325 that enabled her to begin her training. For half the week she attended the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. Her classroom approach\u2014she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote\u2014led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching.Vernon, pp. 7\u20138.Wilkinson 1938, p. 408. At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute.Jackson, p. 24. At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered Katherine Bruce Glasier, whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact. Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had \"brought me into the Socialist movement\u00a0... It always makes me humble to think of her indomitable courage\".Letter from Wilkinson to Middleton, quoted by Bartley, p. 5. After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell, Wilkinson took up the cause of women's suffrage, the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters,Vernon, p. 23. she made a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as \"brilliant and gifted\".Mitchell, p. 193.", "Wilkinson was an early and lifetime supporter of the National Council of Labour Colleges, established in 1921 with NUDAW backing with the aim of educating working-class students in working-class principles.Vernon, pp. 57\u201358. She became a NUDAW-sponsored parliamentary candidate, and in 1923, while still a CPGB member, sought nomination as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for the Gorton constituency. She was unsuccessful, but in November 1923 the Gorton ward elected her to Manchester City Council; Hannah Mitchell, her co-worker in prewar suffrage campaigns, was a fellow councillor.Mitchell, p. 206.

She was sent to London with Annie Kenney, whom she had inspired with her 'sledgehammer of logic and cold reason' as a speaker, to foster the movement there and to create a London-based organisation, which eventually became the headquarters of the Union. This was done on a small financial budget. The following year she was asked to become the second full-time organiser by Keir Hardie in its work with the Labour Party and in this capacity she organised publicity and demonstrations, including on 25 April 1906, unveiling a 'Votes for Women' banner from the Ladies Gallery during the debate in the House of Commons to jeers and shouts,  as well as working on building up the Labour group's new national headquarters in London. In June 1906, Billington-Greig was arrested in an affray outside of H. H. Asquith's home and later sentenced to a fine or two months in Holloway Prison. She was the first suffragette to be sent to Holloway Prison although an anonymous reader of the Daily Mirror paid the fine. Later in the same month, June 1906, she was sent to organise the WSPU in Scotland and she influenced Janie Allan amongst many others, and it was here that she married Frederick Lewis Greig in 1907. They agreed to adopt a common surname of Billington-Greig.  Before that she had helped WSPU canvassing against the Liberal candidate in the Huddersfield by-election with Emmeline Pankhurst and Annie Kenney, impressing local activist Hannah Mitchell. However, growing differences with the Pankhursts led to her resignation as a paid WSPU organiser, though she remained in the group as a member until October 1907."]}, {"page": "1956 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 22 October \u2013 Hannah Mitchell, socialist and suffragette (born 1872)"]}, {"page": "1872 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 February \u2013 Hannah Mitchell, socialist, suffragette (died 1956)"]}, {"page": "List of women's rights activists", "response": ["*Hannah Mitchell (1872\u20131956) \u2013 suffragette and socialist, author of The Hard Way Up"]}, {"page": "Hope Woodlands", "response": ["Socialist and suffragette Hannah Mitchell was born here in 1872."]}, {"page": "Mitchell (surname)", "response": ["*Hannah Mitchell (1872\u20131956), English suffragette and socialist"]}, {"page": "Hannah Mitchell Foundation", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hannah Mitchell "]}, {"page": "Hannah Maria Mitchell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hannah Mitchell"]}, {"page": "Marion Coates Hansen", "response": ["In her memoirs written many years later, the suffragist Hannah Mitchell provides a number of glimpses of Hansen during the 1906\u201310 period.

Thanks to her kindness I managed to get through all the meetings, and she insisted on my staying a few days to rest. The Hanson home was lovely, and it was the first time in my life I had ever been waited on, and nursed, while the beautiful courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Hanson to each other, and to their guests, made those few days like a glimpse of Paradise\".Mitchell, p. 35 and pp. 88\u201389"]}, {"page": "St John's Church, Manchester", "response": ["In 1827, the church erected a building dedicated as a Sunday school. This was also used as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation was at that time condemned by the Board of Education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of \u00a34000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, the church had operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's."]}, {"page": "Helen Archdale", "response": ["Archdale took part in a WSPU demonstration in Edinburgh on 9 October 1909.

Morrissey quickly left that society, along with Dr Alice Ker, as Morrissey saw it as undemocratic and class led. Morrissey was forthright in criticising the lack of a campaign to go out and educate women across all areas of the city to be ready to use the vote. Morrissey went onto become a militant suffragette leader in starting up the Liverpool branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the suffragettes.  Morrissey was considered a friend of the WSPU leaders, the Pankhursts and Hannah Mitchell. However her public profile focussed on her role in the local labour movement, but The Labour Leader praised not her socialist fervour or strength of her case for female enfranchisement, but for her care for the 'creature comforts' of ILP potential recruits at the 'Socialist Socials' in the early 1900s."]}, {"page": "24th Kolkata International Film Festival", "response": ["|Hannah Mitchelle, Alan De Oliveir"]}]}}
