John's sister Gwen John lived in France, and her intimate portraits were relatively little appreciated until decades after her death.  British attitudes to modern art were \"polarized\" at the end of the 19th century.. Modernist movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; Impressionism was initially regarded by \"many conservative critics\" as a \"subversive foreign influence\", but became \"fully assimilated\" into British art during the early-20th century.
