After a chance meeting with a North American Indian spirit guide in the 1950s, Sellers became convinced that the music hall comedian Dan Leno, who died in 1904, haunted him and guided his career and life-decisions.  Sellers was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats, the same exclusive theatrical fraternity founded by Leno in 1890. In 1958 Sellers starred with David Tomlinson, Wilfrid Hyde-White, David Lodge and Lionel Jeffries as a chief petty officer in Val Guest's Up the Creek. Guest later claimed that he had written and directed the film as a vehicle for Sellers, and thus had started Sellers's film career. To practise his voice, Sellers purchased a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The film received critical acclaim in the United States and Roger Lewis viewed it as an important practice ground for Sellers. Next, Sellers featured with Terry-Thomas as one of a pair of comic villains in George Pal's Tom Thumb (1958), a musical fantasy film, opposite Russ Tamblyn, Jessie Matthews and Peter Butterworth. Terry-Thomas later said that \"my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it\". The performance was a landmark in Sellers's career and became his first contact with the Hollywood film industry."]}, {"page": "1981", "response": ["* August 19 \u2013 Jessie Matthews, English dancer, singer and actress (b. 1907)"]}, {"page": "River Thames", "response": ["Jessie Matthews sings \"My river\" in the 1938 film Sailing Along, and the tune is the centrepiece of a major dance number near the end of the film."]}, {"page": "Cole Porter", "response": ["At the age of 36, Porter reintroduced himself to Broadway in 1928 with the musical Paris, his first hit.Kimball (1999), p. 5 It was commissioned by E.
