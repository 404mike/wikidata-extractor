There was no formal accusation against Richard III on the matter; the Bill of Attainder brought by Henry VII made no definitive mention of the Princes in the Tower, but it did accuse Richard of \"the unnatural, mischievous and great perjuries, treasons, homicides and murders, in shedding of infant's blood, with many other wrongs, odious offences and abominations against God and man\".James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps, Letters of the Kings of England, Vol. 1 (1846), p. 161.Rotuli Parliamentorum, J. Strachey (ed.), VI, (1777), p. 276 The \"shedding of infant's blood\" may be an accusation of the Princes' murder. Hicks speculated that it was a reference to speeches made in Parliament condemning the murder of the princes, which suggested that Richard's guilt had become common knowledge, or at least common wisdom."]}, {"page": "University Challenge", "response": ["|Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (Quentin Stafford-Fraser, Helen Castor, Mark Damazer, Lars Tharp)"]}, {"page": "Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham", "response": ["In the late medieval period, all great lords created an affinity between themselves and groups of supporters, who often lived and travelled with them for purposes of mutual benefit and defence, and Humphrey Stafford was no exception. These men were generally his estate tenants, who could be called upon when necessary for soldiering, as well as other duties, and were often retained by indenture. In the late 1440s his immediate affinity was at least ten knights and twenty-seven esquires, mainly drawn from Cheshire. By the 1450s\u2014a period beginning with political tension and ending with civil war\u2014Stafford retained men specifically \"to sojourn and ride\" with him. His affinity was probably composed along the lines laid out by royal ordinance at the time which dictated the nobility should be accompanied by no more than 240 men, including \"forty gentlemen, eighty yeomen and a variety of lesser individuals\", suggested T. B. Pugh, although in peacetime Stafford would have required far fewer. It was directly due to the political climate that this increased, especially after 1457. Stafford's household more generally has been estimated at around 150 people by about 1450, and it has been estimated that maintaining both his affinity and household cost him over \u00a3900 a year.thumb|upright=|Maxstoke Castle, purchased by Stafford from Lord Clinton|alt=Colour photograph of Maxstoke Castle in 2010|leftAlong with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Stafford was the major magnatial influence in Warwickshire, so when Warwick left for a lengthy tour of duty in France, in 1437, Stafford became the centre of regional power stretching from Warwickshire to Derbyshire. He was sufficiently involved in the royal court and government that he was often unable to attend to the needs of his region. This caused him local difficulties; on 5May 1430 a Leicestershire manor of Stafford's was attacked and he faced problems in Derbyshire in the 1440s, although there, Helen Castor has said, Stafford \"made no attempt to restore peace, nor made any attempt to intervene at all\".  Stafford also had major estates on the Welsh Marches. This area was prone to regular lawlessness and particularly occupied his time as a royal justice."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Helen Castor"]}, {"page": "Paston Letters", "response": ["Two recent books have presented the story of the fifteenth-century Pastons for a wide audience, Blood and Roses by Helen Castor (2004) and A Medieval Family by Frances and Joseph Gies (1998).", "*Helen Castor, Blood and Roses: One family's struggle and triumph during the tumultuous Wars of the Roses (2006)."]}, {"page": "Thomas Erpingham", "response": ["The historian Helen Castor has described the Lancastrian presence in East Anglia as a \"disparate collection\u201d that lacked coherence or a single identity. Erpingham rose to become the most important of Lancaster's retainers in the region. He was appointed to a commission of peace, and given powers to preserve order in Norfolk in the aftermath of the Peasants' Revolt in the summer of 1381. He had a part in supervising the defence of Norfolk in 1385, when a French invasion seemed imminent. In 1396 Lancaster granted him the legal right to use the land within the hundred of South Erpingham, a reward for his loyal service to the Duchy of Lancaster."]}, {"page": "John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk", "response": ["De la Pole fought back with what one contemporary labelled \"greet hevyng an shoving.\"  He was successful in doing so. Within a couple of years, Mowbray could not protect his retainers as he had previously done. A Paston letter tells how Robert Wingfield, who was involved in a bitter dispute with one Robert Lyston, \"procured and exited the wurthi prince the Duke of Norffolk to putte oute ageyn the seid Robert Lyston\" from the latter's Suffolk manors. Lyston, with de la Pole's support, repeatedly sued Wingfield until in 1441 Wingfield was imprisoned in the Tower of London. In 1440, Mowbray was able to influence the Exchequer to quash Wingfield's fines; but Mowbray's success was fleeting.  Mowbray was more successful in his support of John Fastolf\u2014in one of the latter's many lawsuits 1441, and was able to impose an advantageous settlement (for Fastolf) in Chancery. Generally, though, says Helen Castor, Mowbray's influence \"proved woefully inadequate\" to protect and defend his retainers and tenants to the degree they could reasonably expect from their lord. It was his supporters' misfortune, one historian has said, that \"Norfolk's power never matched the status attributed to him\"."]}, {"page": "Blood and Roses (book)", "response": ["Blood and Roses: One family's struggle and triumph during the tumultuous Wars of the Roses, by Helen Castor, is a narrative based on the Paston letters of 15th century England.

Based largely on an extensive collection of correspondence, Blood and Roses records the competition among the landed gentry for land, property and advancement.

Reviewing it for The Guardian, Blair Worden wrote: \"If Penn's interpretation can sometimes seem slanted, its exposition would be hard to over-praise. The expressive and evocative power of his writing, and the union of scholarship with artistry, are rare in modern historical writing\". Penn was awarded the HW Fisher Best First Biography prize by the Biographers' Club in 2012 for Winter King."]}]}}
