Llewellyn Publications. p. 52.  \"One medium of the 1920s, Mina Crandon, became famous for producing ectoplasm during her sittings. At the height of the s\u00e9ance, she was even able to produce a tiny ectoplasmic hand from her navel, which waved about in the darkness. Her career ended when Harvard biologists were able to examine the tiny hand and found it to be nothing more than a carved piece of animal liver.\" The German apport medium Heinrich Melzer was discovered to be a fraud in 1926. In a s\u00e9ance psychical researchers found that Melzer had small stones attached to the back of his ears by flesh coloured tape.E. Clephan Palmer. (2003). The Riddle of Spiritualism.
