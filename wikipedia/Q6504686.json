As an officer in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War, he survived three years as a prisoner of war of the Japanese; he passed his captivity by lecturing on politics. After the war ended he moved into politics and was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford. Although generally moderate in politics, his support for British intervention in Suez led him to resign the Conservative Party whip. He lived an extravagant lifestyle far beyond his means, which brought his career to a premature end and led to bankruptcy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Lawrence Turner"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Lawrence Turner"]}, {"page": "Oxford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1950 by-election || Lawrence Turner || Conservative"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Lawrence Turner"]}, {"page": "Henry Frederic Lawrence Turner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lawrence Turner"]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|Lawrence Turner"]}, {"page": "1950 Oxford by-election", "response": ["The 1950 Oxford by-election was held on 2 November 1950 after the incumbent Conservative MP Quintin Hogg succeeded to the peerage.
