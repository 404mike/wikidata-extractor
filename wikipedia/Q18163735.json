In an event which would become a hallmark of the festival, folk and classical music met with a performance by Aly Bain with the Scottish Ensemble. Jerry Douglas, Russ Barenberg, Aly Bain and Phil Cunningham appeared together though not apparently under the name Transatlantic Sessions. Home acts included Capercaillie and the Battlefield Band, and some of the visiting acts were Cherish the Ladies, Martin Hayes & Dennis Cahill, Natalie McMaster, Janis Ian, Carlos Nu\u00f1ez and The Fureys. The Breton show \"Heritage of the Celts\" created by Dan ar Braz and Donal Lunny was considered a \"mixed bag in musical terms\", and diminished by the withdrawal of the Shotts and Dykehead Pipe Band over \"a financial dispute with the French organisers\". My Ain Countrie was a special event organised by Sheena Wellington with Scottish women singers and musicians including Ishbel MacAskill, Karen Matheson, Christine Kydd, Corinna Hewat and the Wrigley Sisters. However the future of the festival was said to be under threat due to local government reorganisation.
