He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for actions during the Battle of the Imjin River during which Carne led The Glorious Glosters in a famous stand against an overwhelming Chinese attack on Gloster Hill.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brainwashing", "response": ["The Oxford English Dictionary records the earliest known English-language usage of the word \"brainwashing\" in an article by a journalist Edward Hunter, in Miami News, published on 24 September 1950. Hunter was an outspoken anticommunist and was alleged to be a CIA agent working undercover as a journalist. Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the Korean War (1950-1953), some American prisoners of war (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, and even in a few cases defected to their side. British radio operator Robert W. Ford and British army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their imprisonment."]}, {"page": "Battle of Kapyong", "response": ["Facing the offensive were 418,000 UN troops, including 152,000 ROK, 245,000 Americans, 11,500 British Commonwealth and 10,000 troops from other UN countries. However, with the US Eighth Army not strong enough to prevent large penetrations along its line, masses of PVA infantry soon swept around its flanks, surrounding entire formations in an attempt to cut off their withdrawal.Johnston 2003, p. 89. Standing directly in the path of the main PVA attack towards Seoul in the I Corps sector was the 29th British Brigade. The brigade's stand on the Imjin River held off two PVA divisions for two days and ultimately helped prevent the capture of Seoul, but resulted in heavy casualties in one of the bloodiest British engagements of the war. During the fighting, most of the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment were killed or captured during a stubborn resistance at the Battle of the Imjin River that saw the commanding officer\u2014Lieutenant Colonel James Carne\u2014awarded the Victoria Cross after his battalion was surrounded.O'Neill 1985, pp. 133\u2013134. Ultimately the 29th Brigade suffered 1,091 casualties in their defence of the Kansas Line, and although they destroyed a large portion of the PVA 63rd Army and inflicted nearly 10,000 casualties, the loss of the Glosters caused a controversy in Britain and within the UN Command.Johnston 2003, pp. 90\u201391. Meanwhile, further east, in the IX Corps sector, the PVA 118th Division, 40th Army and the 60th Division, 20th Army prepared to attack the ROK 6th Division on the night of 22 April.Mossman 1990, p. 401."]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| James Carne || British Army || 1951 || Korean War || Imjin River"]}, {"page": "List of people from Cornwall", "response": ["*James Carne, Victoria Cross DSO, Lieutenant Colonel of the 1st Gloucestershire Regiment,  in the Korean War"]}, {"page": "Non-U.S. recipients of U.S. gallantry awards", "response": ["* James Carne, British Army \u2013 commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment, in the Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951, Lt.
