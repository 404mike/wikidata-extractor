Written by Chris Morgan and Hossein Amini from a story conceived by Morgan and Walter Hamada, the film is a work of Ch\u016bshingura (\"The Treasury of Loyal Retainers\"): a fictionalized account of the forty-seven r\u014dnin, a real-life group of masterless samurai under daimy\u014d Asano Naganori in 18th-century Japan who avenged Naganori's death by confronting his rival Kira Yoshinaka. Starring Keanu Reeves, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tadanobu Asano, Rinko Kikuchi and Ko Shibasaki, the film bears little resemblance to its historical basis compared to previous adaptations, and instead serves as a stylized interpretation set \"in a world of witches and giants.\"Produced by H2F Entertainment, Mid Atlantic Films, Moving Picture Company, Stuber Productions and Relativity Media, 47 Ronin premiered in Japan on December 6, 2013 before being released by Universal Pictures on December 25, 2013 in the United States in both 3D and 2D. While the action sequences and visuals were praised, 47 Ronin received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed just $151 million against its production budget of $175\u2013225 million, making it a costly box office bomb that left Universal in the red for 2013. Variety magazine listed 47 Ronin as one of \"Hollywood's biggest box office bombs of 2013\". Despite its critical and commercial failure, the sequel Blade of the 47 Ronin will be released in 2022.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of foreign films set in Japan", "response": ["* 47 Ronin (2013) \u2014 directed by Carl Rinsch, starring Keanu Reeves and Hiroyuki Sanada"]}, {"page": "Logan's Run (film)", "response": ["In the mid-1990s, Warner Bros. began development of a remake.
