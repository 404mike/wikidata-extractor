His personal best of 5.83 m (19 ft 1+1\u20442 in) set in 2014 is the British indoor record for the event. His outdoor best of 5.70 m (18 ft 8+1\u20444 in) puts him third on the all-time British lists.He represented Great Britain at the World Junior Championships in Athletics in 2006, the European Athletics Junior Championships in 2007, then won a silver medal at the 2009 European Athletics U23 Championships. At his first three senior international championships (2009 World Championships in Athletics, 2010 Commonwealth Games and 2012 European Athletics Championships) he failed to progress beyond the qualifying round. He quit work as an overnight labourer in a lorry depot to focus on pole vault full-time at the start of 2013 which brought an upturn in performances, he won the 2013 British Championship but was passed over for World Championship selection in favour of compatriot Steve Lewis. After a strong beginning to his indoor season in 2014 Cutts came back from a mid season neck injury to win a silver medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.He represented Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luke (given name)", "response": ["*Luke Cutts (born 1988), British pole vaulter"]}, {"page": "List of British records in athletics", "response": ["|Luke Cutts"]}, {"page": "Nick Buckfield", "response": ["His personal best jump was 5.80 metres, achieved in May 1998 in Chania.
