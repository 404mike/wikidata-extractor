Davies became a studio engineer at Island Records studios in the early 1970s, and his first session was the recording process for Brian Eno's album, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy). Davies and Eno worked together on several further projects and made innovations in studio recording techniques, especially regarding tape loops and drum machines. He went on to produce many artists of the 1970s and 1980s, but largely retired from production work in the 1990s, although he continued to work with Bryan Ferry, e.g. on Dylanesque (2007), Olympia (co-producer, 2010) and Avonmore (2014).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "King Crimson", "response": ["In 1981, King Crimson recorded Discipline with producer Rhett Davies. The album displayed a very different version of the band, with newer influences including post-punk, new wave, funk, minimalism, world music and African percussion. With a sound described in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide as having a \"jaw-dropping technique\" of \"knottily rhythmic, harmonically demanding workouts\". Fripp intended to create the sound of a \"rock gamelan\", with an interlocking rhythmic quality to the paired guitars that he found similar to Indonesian gamelan ensembles. Fripp concentrated on playing complex picked arpeggios, while Belew provided an arsenal of guitar sounds that \"often mimic animal noises\". In addition to bass guitar, Levin used the Chapman Stick, a ten-string polyphonic two-handed tapping guitar instrument that has a bass and treble range and which he played in an \"utterly original style\". Bruford experimented with cymbal-less acoustic kits and a Simmons SDS-V electronic drum kit. The band's songs were shorter in comparison to previous King Crimson albums, and very much shaped by Belew's pop sensibilities and quirky approach to writing lyrics. Though the band's previous taste for improvisation was now tightly reined in, one instrumental (\"The Sheltering Sky\") emerged from group rehearsals; while the noisy, half-spoken/half-shouted \"Indiscipline\" was a partially-written, part-improvised piece created in order to give Bruford a chance to escape from the strict rhythmic demands of the rest of the album. Released in September 1981, Discipline reached No. 41 in the UK and No. 45 in the US."]}, {"page": "The B-52's", "response": ["In April 1980, The B-52's returned to Compass Point Studios to record their next album.

We were actually mixing the album, and the version of the song that we'd done just wasn't working out, so as we were mixing we recut the entire song with a completely different groove. We finished it off the last weekend we were mixing. We put some percussion on and some drums on, and then on the Sunday, in the quiet studio time they used to let local bands come in to do demos, Bryan and I popped out for a coffee, and we heard a girl singing in the studio next door. It was a Haitian band that had come in to do some demos, and Bryan and I just looked at each other and went 'What a fantastic voice!'
