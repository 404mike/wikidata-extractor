Toshack also helped the side to win the 1972\u201373 UEFA Cup against German team Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. The 1973 UEFA Cup Final first leg at Anfield was abandoned due to a torrential downpour after 27 minutes and rescheduled to be played again the next day. The 27 minutes that had been played had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's defensive vulnerability in the air. To exploit this, he brought tall forward Toshack into the starting team demoting the small build of Brian Hall to appearing only as a late substitute. Keegan profited with two goals set up by Toshack headers in a 3\u20130 win.

Described by Liverpool as one of Hall's best games, he lined up with Peter Cormack in an all-Scottish born central-midfield pairing. For the opening goal Tommy Smith sent in a cross from the right towards Hall on the edge of the box that Hall dived underneath.

Liverpool won the league title in 1975\u201376 with a final day victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers to beat Queens Park Rangers into second place.
