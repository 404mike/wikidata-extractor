In due course he became Principal lecturer in Painting at the Chelsea College of Art & Design in Chelsea as well as Artist-in-Residence and Supernumerary Fellow at Balliol College Oxford University. In 1978 he won the John Moores Painting Prize His art can best be described as abstract, colourful and usually involving a cross-weaved fabric of straight or curved parallel lines drawn by hand, often executed in oil on linen. He died in London.\n\n\"Noel was in my view the most important post-War abstract painter in England, and his work combined performance, intellectual rigour and the artist's craft. It was simultaneously clever and sensuous. He was an influential teacher too and a very gifted musician. But he was also larger than life.\" Stephen Bury, Curator, British Library, 8 December 2007\n\n\"Noel was a splendid friend, and a wonderful painter.He thought endlessly about the relations of paint and light, and talked with extraordinary clarity - and complexity - about making works of art. He taught me a lot about looking.The ideas behind his own work were intricate and uncompromising.\"\n\nhttp://www.noelforster.co.uk AS Byatt, Author, Dec 2007\n\n\"Noel Forster was an adventurous and productive artist whose glowing, audacious personality looked out from his canvasses.\"\nObituary in The Times, 17 January 2008 Bernard Cohen, Artist, Dec 2007", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Camberwell College of Arts", "response": ["In the 1980s, Wendy Smith became the head of Fine Art and employed Noel Forster, John Hilliard, Cornelia Parker, Phyllida Barlow, Gavin Jantjes and Ian McKeever.
