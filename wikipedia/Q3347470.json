His mission was delayed at the port of Pak Nam until he had given a satisfactory account of gifts to the palace, ending with interrogation into minute details with regards to the gift of a horse, which Crawfurd considered \"but a good specimen of the indelicacy and rapacity which we afterwards found so characteristic of the Siamese Court and its officers, upon every question of a similar nature\".

He often quoted from Confucian literature in criticizing an event or a decision of the previous dynasties that, according to Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean, did not follow the Confucian codes for an appropriate ruling institution. According to O. W. Wolters, Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean respected the Confucian perspective to the extent that the highest praise he could lavish on a Vietnamese ruler was that his achievements could not be bettered by even the most famous Chinese emperors in antiquity. However, the criticism and often harsh remarks of Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean towards previous dynasties, especially the Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty, could be understood as the historian's concern for the current dynasty, because the L\u00ea Dynasty would fall into collapse unless it could avoid the mistakes that were committed by its predecessors like the Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty. Besides, the historian paid attention in defining the identity of the nation; a typical example of this intention was the existence of the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng Dynasty in Peripheral Records, Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean's introduction of this dynasty was challenged by several historians for the lack of information and the real motive of the historian in writing about H\u00f9ng kings.
