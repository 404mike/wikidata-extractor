He was educated at Nottingham High School and joined Simon, Meyer & Co, a lace exporter, as a clerk. He rose to be chief clerk and in 1899 launched his own stockbroking firm in Leicester, concentrating on serving Midlands firms which were too small to launch themselves in the City of London.\nDuring the First World War, Wheeler dedicated his energies to selling war bonds, and for this he was created a baronet in the 1920 New Year Honours. He was ruined by the Depression, was declared bankrupt, and in 1931 was jailed for twelve months for fraud. After his release he retired from business.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Wheeler", "response": ["* Sir Arthur Wheeler, 1st Baronet (1860\u20131943), English stockbroker and financier"]}, {"page": "Arthur Wheeler (stockbroker)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Arthur Wheeler, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Wheeler baronets", "response": ["*Sir Arthur Wheeler, 1st Baronet (1860\u20131943)"]}]}}
