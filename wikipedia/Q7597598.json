Born in Wood Green, England, he served with Royal Air Force in World War II before competing in the 10,000-metre event at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Unable to participate in the 1950 British Empire Games, he returned to the Olympics in 1952, although he did not complete his event, the marathon, due to the flu. At the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, he suffered a sunstroke and collapsed within two miles (3 km) of the finish. He retired from running in 1956, but continued to work with UK Athletics for several years and was due to participate in the ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 27", "response": ["*2012 \u2013 Stan Cox, English runner (b. 1918)"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1948 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Stan Cox"]}, {"page": "Herbert Johnston", "response": ["He continued to contribute to British athletics after he retired from running by coaching several prominent long-distance runners including Jim Peters, who held the world record in the marathon for six years, as well as Stan Cox and Fred Norris.
