Grace's cricket career (1864 to 1870)", "response": ["It is generally understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870, having developed from Dr Henry Grace's West Gloucestershire club.Birley, p.104. Gloucestershire acquired first-class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down near Bristol on 2, 3 & 4 June 1870. With Grace and his brothers E.M. and Fred playing, Gloucestershire won that game by 51 runs and quickly became one of the best teams in England. The club was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877 as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874.Webber, County Championship, pp.14\u201320. The Gloucestershire team in the club's inaugural match was (in batting order): E. M. Grace, W. G. Grace, Thomas Matthews (career from 1870 to 1878), Frank Townsend (1870 to 1891), Fred Grace, Charles Filgate (1869 to 1877), John Halford (1870 to 1874), John Mills (1870 only), James Bush (1870 to 1890), Robert Miles (1867 to 1879) and William Macpherson (1870 to 1871). The three Graces, Filgate and Miles had played first-class cricket previously but the other six were all debutants in this match. Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870 and Gloucestershire won this by an innings and 129 runs. Grace scored 143, sharing a second wicket partnership with Townsend (89) of 234. He took eight wickets in the match but the outstanding bowler was slow left-armer Miles who took 6\u201386 and 6\u201320. George Strachan (career from 1870 to 1882) and Charles Gordon (1870 to 1875) made their first appearances for Gloucestershire."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* William Macpherson (1870\u20131871) : W.
