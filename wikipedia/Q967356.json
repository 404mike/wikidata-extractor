He was perhaps the greatest of the Oxford Calculators of Merton College, where he was a fellow certainly by 1344 and possibly by 1340. His magnum opus was a series of treatises known as the Liber calculationum (\"Book of Calculations\"), written c. 1350, which earned him the nickname of The Calculator.\n\nRobert Burton (d. 1640) wrote in The Anatomy of Melancholy that \"Scaliger and Cardan admire Suisset the calculator, qui pene modum excessit humani ingenii [whose talents were almost superhuman]\".  Gottfried Leibniz wrote in a letter of 1714: \"Il y a eu autrefois un Suisse, qui avoit math\u00e9matis\u00e9 dans la Scholastique: ses Ouvrages sont peu connus; mais ce que j'en ai vu m'a paru profond et consid\u00e9rable.\"  (\"There was once a Suisse, who did mathematics belonging to scholasticism; his works are little known, but what I have seen of them seemed to me profound and relevant.\")  Leibniz even had a copy of one of Swineshead's treatises made from an edition in the Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi in Paris.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Bradwardine", "response": ["Merton College sheltered a group of dons devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, rivals of the intellectuals at the University of Paris.

One of his main pieces of work, Summa logicae et philosophiae naturalis, focused on explaining the natural world in a coherent and realistic manner, unlike some of his colleagues, claiming that they were making light of serious endeavors.

These four medieval scholastics held a common bond in that their study interests were in a similar field, but the method of study which brought these fellows into the same sphere of learning was of a more esoteric bent than modern university methods. They were interested in mathematics and logical analysis for the purposes of natural philosophy, theology, and an a priori type of mathematical physics (not to be confused with modern, empirical, experimental physics). Thus, the physics postulations and conjectures made by Dumbleton and his Oxford contemporaries were primarily done without any application of physical experimentation. Dumbleton, along with the other three Merton philosophers, received the moniker 'Calculators' for their adherence to mathematics and logical disputation when solving philosophical and theological problems.Robert Pasnau (ed.) and Christina Van Dyke (2nd ed.).
