E. H. Love, was a mathematician famous for his work on the mathematical theory of elasticity. He also worked on wave propagation and his work on the structure of the Earth in Some Problems of Geodynamics won for him the Adams prize in 1911 when he developed a mathematical model of surface waves known as Love waves. \nLove also contributed to the theory of tidal locking and introduced the parameters known as Love numbers, used in problems related to Earth tides, the tidal deformation of the solid Earth due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun.\nHe was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and in 1881 won a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was at first undecided whether to study classics or mathematics. His successful progress (he was placed Second Wrangler) vindicated his choice of mathematics, and in 1886 he was elected Fellow of the college. In 1899 he was appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Oxford, a position which he retained until his death in 1940. He was also a Fellow of Queen's College.\nHe authored the two volume classic, A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity. He was the author of several articles in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, including Elasticity and Infinitesimal CalculusHis other awards include the Royal Society Royal Medal in 1909 and Sylvester Medal in 1937, the London Mathematical Society De Morgan Medal in 1926. He was secretary to the London Mathematical Society between 1895 and 1910, and president for 1912\u20131913.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 17", "response": ["*1863 \u2013 Augustus Edward Hough Love, English mathematician and theorist (d. 1940)"]}, {"page": "List of geophysicists", "response": ["* Augustus Edward Hough Love (English, 1863\u20131940) \u2013 developed theory of Love waves"]}, {"page": "List of theoretical physicists", "response": ["* Augustus Edward Hough Love (1863\u20131940)"]}, {"page": "Scientific phenomena named after people", "response": ["* Love waves \u2013 Augustus Edward Hough Love"]}, {"page": "Augustus Love", "response": ["#REDIRECT Augustus Edward Hough Love"]}, {"page": "A.E.H.

The Love wave is a result of the interference of many shear waves (S-waves) guided by an elastic layer, which is welded to an elastic half space on one side while bordering a vacuum on the other side. In seismology, Love waves (also known as Q waves (Quer: German for lateral)) are surface seismic waves that cause horizontal shifting of the Earth during an earthquake. Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911.  They form a distinct class, different from other types of seismic waves, such as P-waves and S-waves (both body waves), or Rayleigh waves (another type of surface wave).  Love waves travel with a lower velocity than P- or S- waves, but faster than Rayleigh waves. These waves are observed only when there is a low velocity layer overlying a high velocity layer/ sub\u2013layers."]}, {"page": "Love (crater)", "response": ["Love is an impact crater on the far side of the Moon.
