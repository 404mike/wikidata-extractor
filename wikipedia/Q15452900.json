Burgess mentioned his 'projected college for clerical education in South Wales,' although at this time 'he did not appear to be sanguine in the hope of speedily realising the plan.' Harford knew that a college at Lampeter 'would tend to civilise and improve the vicinity.' In the Autumn of 1820,  Harford offered to donate to Burgess the site of Lampeter Castle, 'Castle Field' or 'Cae Castell' in Welsh, which, as Lords of the Manor of Lampeter, he and his brothers now owned. As such, it is on land donated by Harford that the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (formerly St David's College) now stands. A bust of Harford is in the collection of the University, and is currently on display in that institution's main library building on the Lampeter campus. Two halls of residence at the university, Harford I and Harford II, are also named after him. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cardiganshire for 1825\u201326."]}, {"page": "Bishop of Lichfield", "response": ["| 60px Henry Ryder"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Gloucester", "response": ["| 60px Henry Ryder"]}]}}
