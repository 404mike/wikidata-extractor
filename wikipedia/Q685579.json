Southampton were later criticised, however, after allegedly refusing to remain on the pitch to share the trophy, which was founded in the memory of the club's former president Andrew Letts. The club played League Two side Barnet on 27 July, with a starting lineup consisting of a mix of regular first team players, youth regulars and trialists.

Despite dominating the first half, it was the visiting side who broke the deadlock when Luke Summerfield scored within two minutes of the beginning of the second half. Substitute Adam Lallana was the first to test Argyle goalkeeper David Button in the last quarter of the game, but the home side failed to regain their early momentum to slip to a defeat in their first game of the campaign despite a number of late chances. The club were due to play Milton Keynes Dons at Stadium:mk on 14 August, but due to the death of Markus Liebherr the match was rescheduled for 15 September.

Adkins began his time on the South Coast poorly, leading Southampton to their fourth consecutive goalless defeat at the hands of the Dons. The first half ended goalless, with goalkeepers David Martin and Kelvin Davis impressing with saves from Rickie Lambert and Lewis Guy respectively, but two goals in the last 20 minutes from Angelo Balanta and Peter Leven left the visitors in the relegation zone with their game in hand played. The club's disappointing run of results continued on 18 September with a goalless draw against Colchester United, leaving them in the relegation zone. The game itself was arguably evenly spread between Southampton and Colchester, with the home side said to be edging ahead in the second half culminating in three consecutive chances for Rickie Lambert in injury time at the end of the game. On 25 September Southampton earned their first win in six games by beating Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough Stadium. Lee Barnard scored his second league goal of the season (and the first under manager Nigel Adkins) to end the club's 510-minute goal drought to help them out of the relegation zone. The game was largely dominant for the Saints, although for short periods of time throughout the game Wednesday looked to be on top of proceedings. Other chances came from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Rickie Lambert, and at the very end of the game goalkeeper Kelvin Davis pulled off a string of impressive saves to hold on to the 1\u20130 for Southampton. In the final game of the month on 28 September, Southampton were unable to build on the previous weekend's win, drawing 1\u20131 at Yeovil Town. Brazilian loan signing Guilherme do Prado, who came on as a substitute for the second half, scored his first goal of the season for the Saints just before the hour mark, only to be cancelled out by an Adam Virgo penalty less than ten minutes later.

The home side opened the scoring within ten minutes, with Mike Edwards heading in a Ben Davies free kick to give new manager Paul Ince a dream start to his managerial spell with the club. County held onto their lead until just before the 70-minute mark, when captain John Tompson was shown a straight red card for bringing down Lee Barnard in the box, subsequently resulting in a penalty for the visiting side. Rickie Lambert converted the spot kick to equalise for Southampton, before setting up Barnard himself for a goal just a few minutes later to take the lead. Winger Adam Lallana scored in injury time to seal the win against the ten-man Notts County, sending the South Coast club up to 9th place in the league, their highest since the beginning of the campaign. On 2 November the Saints faced 23rd-placed Dagenham & Redbridge at home, another recently promoted side, and picked up an extremely comfortable 4\u20130 win. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain picked up two more goals to add to his impressive recent tally and put the home side 2\u20130 up going into half time, before Lee Barnard and Jos\u00e9 Fonte scored in the 56th and 69th minutes respectively to convert the dominant performance into another win for Southampton. As a result, the club moved into 6th place, the first time they had been in a playoff position all season. On 13 November the club's winning streak ended at the hands of Carlisle United who picked up a 3\u20132 win over the Saints. The first half saw Southampton display one of their worst performances of the season, with a Dan Harding own goal putting Carlisle into half-time two goals up. Another goal from teenage winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave the Saints a lifeline, although Carlisle picked up one more to make Dean Hammond's 81st-minute long range strike a mere consolation.", "Southampton got back on track with their sixth home win in a row in all competitions against Peterborough United on 20 November with a convincing 4\u20131 win. Goals came from Lee Barnard, Jos\u00e9 Fonte, Richard Chaplow and Guly do Prado, which sent the club back into the playoff positions in preparation for the match against first-place Brighton & Hove Albion later in the week. The game against Brighton, contested on 23 November, ended goalless after Southampton owned the first half and also arguably out-performed the visitors in the second period. Kelvin Davis notably saved a penalty, while Southampton had a large number of chances thwarted by the defensive Brighton side who ultimately held on to end Southampton's winning run at home. After a long break due to adverse weather conditions, Southampton hosted Brentford on 11 December and lost 2\u20130, with first half goals coming from strikers Gary Alexander and Charlie MacDonald. After more postponed matches, the Saints returned to St Mary's on 28 December to defeat Huddersfield Town 4\u20131 in the first return game of the season. Despite going 1\u20130 down in the first half, the Saints dominated the majority of the game and goals from Rickie Lambert, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Radhi Ja\u00efdi and Richard Chaplow helped the home side move swiftly to the playoff positions in 5th place.", "Southampton began 2011 in top form, beating Exeter City 4\u20130 on 1 January. Winger Guly do Prado scored twice, before Adam Lallana and substitute Lee Barnard topped off the match with goals in the second half. Thanks to results elsewhere in the league, the result sent the club to the automatic promotion places for the first time in the season. Just two days later, the Saints travelled to play the return match against Dagenham & Redbridge, after beating the side 4\u20130 in November. After a goalless first half and numerous Saints chances, the visiting club broke the deadlock less than two minutes after the break, when Adam Lallana scored his eighth of the season with an overhead kick. Guly do Prado made it 2\u20130 after 75 minutes, before Josh Scott headered in a goal for the home side in the last ten minutes. Dagenham were unable to make the goal count for anything, however, as striker Rickie Lambert finished the game off with a goal in the last minute to keep Saints in the automatic promotion places. On 11 January Southampton closed the gap on League leaders Brighton by thrashing Oldham Athletic 6\u20130 at Boundary Park. The scoring started early, as winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored within nine minutes before Adam Lallana made it two shortly before half time. In the second half though, the Saints made their advantage really count, converting a further four chances with Guly do Prado, Richard Chaplow, Rickie Lambert and substitute Lee Barnard adding to their season tallies to increase the pressure at the top of League One. Southampton's winning run came to an end on 15 January, as the match with Notts County ended goalless. The Saints had the majority of possession throughout the game, Jos\u00e9 Fonte was denied a goal in the second half as his header was cleared off the line, and in the last minute Ryan Dickson cleared a County effort off the line to leave the match goalless. The misfortune continued when Southampton lost 2\u20130 to Tranmere Rovers in the return game at Prenton Park. The first half was dominated by the struggling home side, and marked by a goal for midfielder John Welsh following a miscommunication between Saints goalkeeper Kelvin Davis and defender Jos\u00e9 Fonte. The visiting team continued to struggle in the second half, and under-performances from players such as Rickie Lambert, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Guly do Prado meant that Rovers doubled their lead thanks to a goal from Dale Jennings, sending the Saints down to fourth below local rivals Bournemouth following their win over league leaders Brighton.", "On 1 February, Saints scraped a win at Exeter City to avoid a three-game losing streak. The game ended 2\u20131 to Southampton after a brace of goals from Rickie Lambert, including a final-minute winner, reversed the initial Exeter lead. Daniel Nardiello opened the scoring for the home side just before half time, and it took until 20 minutes before the end for the visitors to come back, when Lambert headed in a cross from new signing Dany N'Guessan to equalise. Lambert doubled his tally in the last minute of normal time, heading in another cross this time from returning midfielder Dean Hammond. On 5 February Southampton dropped two points in the return match against Peterborough United, sharing the spoils in an eight-goal thriller. The visitors started off the game well, going 2\u20130 up within half an hour following a Richard Chaplow goal and a Rickie Lambert penalty, but in the last six minutes of the first half Peterborough equalised with strikes from Craig Mackail-Smith and Chris Whelpdale. Lambert scored a second penalty just after the break to extend his lead as the club's top scorer of the season, and returning captain Dean Hammond restored the Saints' two-goal lead just three minutes later. A further two penalties for Peterborough led to a 4\u20134 draw, with the final goal coming from Lee Tomlin in the third minute of injury time at the end of the match. A week later the Saints reduced Huddersfield Town's lead in 3rd place of the table when they defeated Carlisle United 1\u20130 at home in a relatively uneventful game. The game was initially brought alive within the last five minutes of the first half, when Carlisle defender Gary Borrowdale was sent off after receiving a second booking for arguing with the assistant referee, after which Rickie Lambert scored his 50th Southampton goal by heading in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross. In the second half, further chances were limited and Southampton nervously picked up three points while Huddersfield played out a goalless draw with Oldham Athletic meaning Southampton could go ahead of Huddersfield should they win their game-in-hand. Southampton remained fifth with several games in hand over Peterborough, Huddersfield and Bournemouth after drawing 0\u20130 with Hartlepool United on 22 February. Southampton upheld their unbeaten league run at the weekend, beating Swindon Town 4\u20131 at home in a convincing performance marked by only five minutes of Swindon dominance in the second half. Adam Lallana opened the scoring for the home side after just 15 minutes, and chances for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Guly do Prado could have increased the scoreline going into half-time. In the second half, winger Matt Ritchie equalised for Swindon, but his effort was cancelled out within minutes when Rickie Lambert and Radhi Ja\u00efdi both scored from set pieces within two minutes of one another to make it 3\u20131. With more chances for Saints in the later stages of the game, substitute Lee Barnard eventually confirmed the win for Southampton with a goal in stoppage time.", "On 1 March, Southampton lost away to Walsall, who before the match were in the relegation zone. In terms of attempts and pressure, the visitors were largely on top for most of the game, but it was Walsall who made their chance count when Jon Macken scored in a period dominated by Saints chances in the second half. Despite late chances for Lallana, Barnard, Lambert and Ja\u00efdi, Walsall rode out the 1\u20130 victory to leave Saints in 5th place in the table. The Saints won their return game against Colchester United 2\u20130 on 5 March, increasing the pressure in the top section of the table. After largely dominating the opening period, the visitors went one up after half an hour with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain poaching a goal following a Rickie Lambert free kick. Within two minutes of the goal, Colchester were reduced to ten players as striker David Mooney was sent off for challenging Danny Butterfield off the ball, and Southampton's dominance was made easier for the remainder of the game. In the second half the team made their advantage count, as captain and former Colchester player Dean Hammond scored his third league goal of the season from inside to double Southampton's lead and secure the three points. Back at St Mary's on 8 March, Southampton beat struggling side Yeovil Town 3\u20130. Lee Barnard scored twice to bring his league tally to 10, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain finished off the scoring in the second half with a long-range solo effort. The Saints remained fifth, however, as teams above them won their matches too.", "On 13 March, Southampton travelled to Dean Court for the second local derby against Bournemouth of the season. Southampton won the game 3\u20131, meaning they moved above the home side in the league table. The game was an exciting encounter all-round, with Finnish teenage striker Lauri Dalla Valle, on loan from Fulham, opening the scoring for Bournemouth in the 6th minutes, despite Southampton players' protests of offside. Just five minutes later however, it was all level again when Lee Barnard's header was fumbled by the Bournemouth defence and found its way into the net for 1\u20131. In the second half, Southampton took the lead thanks to a goal from captain Dean Hammond, and top scorer Rickie Lambert assured the win in the 88th minute with a solo effort. In injury time, Oscar Gobern received a red card, but Southampton cruised to victory to move up to 4th place in the table once again. Southampton picked up a fourth league win in a row on 19 March, beating Sheffield Wednesday 2\u20130 in a late kick-off. Despite a number of good chances for the Saints in the opening 45 minutes, it took until 15 minutes into the second half for defender Jos\u00e9 Fonte to break the deadlock, heading in an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain corner. With the team in full flow now, Rickie Lambert scored his 17th goal of the season just six minutes later to make it two for Southampton and secure the win. It could have been more though, with Adam Lallana hitting the post shortly after Lambert's goal and a great performance from Wednesday goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell denying further opportunities from Oxlade-Chamberlain and others.", "Southampton moved up to third place in the table on 24 March when they picked up a point against Charlton Athletic at The Valley, although missed out on the chance to move second with two games still in hand over Huddersfield Town. The Saints largely edged out the home side throughout the game, with more possession and chances on goal, but it took until after the hour mark to break the deadlock when defender Radhi Ja\u00efdi headed in a corner from Guly do Prado, who had only come on as a substitute three minutes earlier. Charlton increased the pressure in the last 20 minutes, and former Saints player Bradley Wright-Phillips equalised the game in the 86th minute to crush Southampton's hopes of moving into the League One promotion places. After a two-week break, Southampton returned to St Mary's to face Milton Keynes Dons on 2 April 2011 and won 3\u20132. The visiting side were on top for most of the first half, and opened the scoring in the 34th minute when Gary MacKenzie headed in a Peter Leven corner. The Dons doubled their lead early in the second half courtesy of Sam Baldock, but after Jonathan Forte came on for the Saints shortly after the hour mark the dynamic of the game changed: Forte scored two goals in the space of two minutes, bringing Southampton level and giving them a chance to make the game their own. It only took another ten minutes for the home team to score another and take the lead, this time courtesy of Lee Barnard latching onto a Rickie Lambert assist. Southampton held out for the victory, and remained third in the table with three games in hand over Huddersfield and two over Brighton. Southampton's run of good form was continued when they played Charlton Athletic at St Mary's just two weeks after the match at The Valley, winning 2\u20130. Goals came from Guly do Prado early in the first half and from Lee Barnard early in the second, with each scorer setting up the other for their goal.", "Southampton moved into the automatic promotion places of League One on 9 April by beating Leyton Orient 2\u20130 at Brisbane Road. The Saints rode their luck somewhat throughout the game, as Orient playmaker Jimmy Smith was denied two goals for offside and Stephen Dawson hit the post in the last minute. Rickie Lambert scored his 18th goal of the season in the 26th minute to put the Saints one up, and the victory was sealed in the 88th minute by a goal from Lee Barnard. The victory was complemented by Huddersfield Town drawing 1\u20131 with Peterborough United, which meant that Southampton could move past them into second place in the table, still with two games in hand. Three days later though, Southampton lost for the first time in ten games at Rochdale in one of their games-in-hand over third-placed Huddersfield and leaders Brighton. Midfielder Joe Thompson opened the scoring just before the half-hour mark with a headed goal before striker Chris O'Grady made it two before half time. The visitors had more of the ball overall and more chances on goal, but Rochdale held onto the clean sheet and the two-goal lead to leave Southampton trailing even further behind Brighton, who picked up another win to go 16 points ahead at the top of League One. Southampton picked up an important three points on 16 April against Bristol Rovers, when they won by a single goal at St Mary's. The game was marked by the high number of bookings it heralded \u2013 four for the Saints and three for Rovers \u2013 as well as an injury to striker Lee Barnard which forced him to be carried off the pitch on a stretcher.
