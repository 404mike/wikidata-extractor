Complications to his recovery meant that he did not return to action for 13 months, resuming play in a 1\u20131 home draw with Sheffield United, but was unable to prevent the club slipping back to the Fourth Division. He completed his time with Scunthorpe having scored seven league goals in 41 games."]}]}}
