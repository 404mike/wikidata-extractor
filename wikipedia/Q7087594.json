Brooke Herford and Hannah Hankinson Herford. Oliver's father, Brooke, was a Unitarian minister who moved the family to Chicago in 1876 and to Boston in 1882. Oliver attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio from 1877 to 1879. Later he studied art at the Slade School in London and the Acad\u00e9mie Julien in Paris. Afterward, he moved to New York, where he lived until his death. He has been called \"The American Oscar Wilde\".  As a frequent contributor to The Mentor, Life, and Ladies' Home Journal, he sometimes signed his artwork as \"O Herford\".  In 1906 he wrote and illustrated the Little Book of Bores.  He also wrote short poems like \"The Chimpanzee\" and \"The Hen\", as well as writing and illustrating \"The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten\" (1904) and \"Excuse It Please\" (1930). His sister Beatrice Herford was also a humorist.\nEthel Mumford and Addison Mizner wrote a small book, The Cynic's Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1903, as a Christmas present and added Herford's name as an author as a joke. The printer made up more copies to sell and to everyone's surprise it was an astounding success. When Herford found out about it he wanted 90% of the royalties. He was awarded an equal third.\n\nHerford's cartoons and humorous verse appeared in journals such as Life, Woman's Home Companion, Century Magazine, Harper's Weekly, The Masses and Punch. Over 30 books illustrated by Herford, and frequently written by him as well, were published from the 1890s to the 1930s. He also wrote plays and was known for his humorous and pithy bon mots. Herford was a longtime member of the Players Club in New York City. He married Margaret Regan in New York on May 26, 1904. Herford died on July 5, 1935 and his wife died the following December.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam", "response": ["* Oliver Herford released a parody of the Rubaiyat called \"The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten\" in 1904, which is notable for its charming illustrations of the kitten in question on his philosophical adventures."]}, {"page": "Joel Chandler Harris", "response": ["* Little Mr. Thimblefinger and his Queer Country: What the Children Saw and Heard There (Houghton Mifflin, 1894), illustrated by Oliver Herford, "]}, {"page": "Kate Douglas Wiggin", "response": ["* Timothy's Quest (1890), illustrated by Oliver Herford"]}, {"page": "Henry Ward Beecher", "response": ["A limerick written about Beecher by poet Oliver Herford became well known in the USA:"]}, {"page": "Life (magazine)", "response": ["The magazine was a success and soon attracted the industry's leading contributors, of which the most important was Charles Dana Gibson.

In New York, he also taught piano (and possibly composition).  He was a \"tough-love\" kind of teacher.  He was harsh, often mockingly humorous, in his criticisms of his students, but at least some of them felt that it was well-meant.  He frequently offered the same blunt criticisms of his adult friends' music, as well as of his own.  In 1905 he was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters.  Sometime during his career, he was head of the Organ Department at the Cincinnati College of Music, under Theodore Thomas."]}]}}
