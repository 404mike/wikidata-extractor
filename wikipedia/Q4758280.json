Hons and Ph.D.). He holds a Postgraduate Certificate in Educational Leadership (Higher Education) from Macquarie University.\nIn 2002 Pitman became a Professor at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, moving to University of New South Wales in 2007. He is currently the Director of the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes. Prior to this, Pitman was the Director of the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (2011 - 2017). He won the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographical Society's Priestly Medal for excellence in Atmospheric Science Research in 2004 and the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographical Medal in 2009. He contributed to the Copenhagen Diagnosis which was shortlisted for a 2010 Eureka Prize and won the 2010 Future Justice Prize. He was shortlisted for the 2017 and 2018 Eureka Prizes for Science leadership. He won the New South Wales' NSW Climate Scientist of the year in 2010. \nIn January 2019 Pitman was made an Officer of the  Order of Australia (AO) \"for distinguished service to science as a leading researcher, particularly of climate systems and the environment\". In December 2019 Pitman was awarded the Royal Society of Victoria's Medal for Excellence in Scientific Research. He was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in May 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Macquarie University people", "response": ["|Andrew Pitman", "*Andrew Pitman, British atmospheric scientist"]}, {"page": "Matthew England", "response": ["After completing his PhD he took up a postdoctoral research fellowship at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, in Toulouse, France, from 1992-1994.

Insertion of bugs into climate models?\" Another IPCC lead author, David Karoly of the University of Melbourne, reported receiving hate emails in the wake of the incident and said that he believed that there was \"an organised campaign to discredit individual climate scientists\".
