Matthews announced his policy of 'attracting and nurturing young footballers' and stressed the need for 'patience'. Matthews did not receive and did not request a contract. Though a massive lift for the club at the time, this development transpired to be a negative one for all involved, as Roy Sproson later explained that 'the club had their priorities wrong and the first team suffered badly, whilst Stan trusted people, who took advantage of him'. Most of the summer signings were youngsters, which also suited the club's directors, who had overseen massive losses over the past two seasons. In came Brian Taylor (\u00a33,000 from Shrewsbury Town); winger Roger Smith (Walsall); Scottish inside-forwards John Cummings and Tommy Morrison (Aberdeen); as well as sixteen-year-old Scottish trialist winger Alex Donald. Matthews also initiated a series of trials for 700 boys.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| John Cummings", "|\u2013||FW||||John Cummings||0||1||0||1", "| July 1965 || FW ||  || John Cummings ||  Aberdeen || Free transfer || ", "| March 1966 || FW ||  || John Cummings ||  Ayr United || Released || "]}]}}
