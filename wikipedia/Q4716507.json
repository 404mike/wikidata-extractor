A young woman called Hur (Alethea Charlton) warns him that if he fails to do so, the stranger called Kal (Jeremy Young) will be made leader. After exiting the TARDIS, the unnamed old man, whom Ian and Barbara refer to as the Doctor, is kidnapped by Kal, when he witnesses him light a match. Kal takes the Doctor back to the tribe and threatens to kill him if he does not make fire; Ian, Barbara and Susan intervene, but the group is imprisoned in a large cave. With the help of Old Mother (Eileen Way), who believes that fire will bring death to the tribe, they escape from the settlement but are intercepted and recaptured before reaching the TARDIS. Kal says they will be sacrificed if they do not make fire. While Ian tries to start a fire, Kal enters the cave and attacks Za, but is killed. Ian gives a burning torch to Za, who shows it to the tribe and is declared leader. Susan notices that placing a skull over a burning torch makes it appear alive; when the tribe enters the cave, they are faced with several burning skulls, and are terrified, allowing the group to flee to the TARDIS and escape through time and space to a silent and unknown forest. Unnoticed by the crew, the radiation meter rises to \"Danger\"."]}, {"page": "Doomwatch", "response": ["Cast: John Paul as Dr Spencer Quist, Simon Oates as Dr John Ridge, John Nolan as Geoff Hardcastle, Jean Trend as Dr Fay Chantry, Joby Blanshard as Colin Bradley, Vivien Sherrard as Barbara Mason, Patrick Troughton as McArthur, Alethea Charlton as Flora Seton, Jane Dore as Receptionist, Simon Lack as Andrew Seton, David Purcell as Journalist, Michael Ellison as Naval Officer, Joseph Greig as Dr Jackson."]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Susan RichardsAlethea CharltonStanley MeadowsShelagh FraserGeoffrey HibbertDavid WebbPeter DucrowJack Wild", "| Faith BrookGwen Ffrangcon-DaviesJoanna LumleyHenry GilbertRoger HammondAlethea CharltonPhilip MadocLillias Walker"]}, {"page": "The Time Meddler", "response": ["The First Doctor (William Hartnell) and Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) find Steven Taylor (Peter Purves) aboard the TARDIS after he stumbled in during a disorientated state on Mechanus.

He discovers that it is 1066, since Harold Godwinson has not yet faced Harald Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.
