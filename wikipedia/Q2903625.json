He was involved in disputes with a number of criminal figures, for example, when he and Billy Tracy were thrown out of a Bowery gambling resort by its owner Harry Hill and British lightweight boxer Billy Edwards in November 1870.\"Rampant Rowdyism.; Desperate Attempt to Murder Harry Hill in His Saloon--Arrest of One Man\". New York Times. 11 Nov 1870 On the afternoon of January 24, 1871, Haggerty and three others arrived at Jem Mace's Capitol Saloon on Twenty-Third Street. They had become intoxicated while traveling by sleigh along Harlem Lane and, shortly after their arrival, they became involved in a violent altercation with another group of patrons. It was thought that Haggerty and his party were about to use their pistols when a local patrolman and a City Hall officer arrived from nearby Booth's Theater. At the appearance of the patrolman walking through the saloon door, Haggerty drew his revolver and pistol whipped him sending the officer outside. As the two officers went to get reinforcements, Haggerty and his men made their escape on the sleigh. His whereabouts remained unknown until early the next morning when he entered Patrick Egan's saloon. While there, his friend Billy Tracy became involved in a dispute with Shang Draper stemming from the earlier dispute at Jem Mace's saloon. Reddy the Blacksmith, a longtime member of the Bowery Boys, attempted to separate the two but Haggerty confronted Reddy and demanded that he stay out of it. As the two argued, Haggerty reportedly attempted to grab a decanter from the bar to strike the Bowery Boy with causing Reddy to draw his pistol and shot Haggerty in the abdomen. Haggerty was taken to a room in West Houston Street where claimed he did not know either Tracy or Draper and that he was so intoxicated that he was unable to recognize who fired the shot. Although mortally wounded, an examination finding the bullet had penetrated his intestines, Haggerty refused to name his attacker and died from his wounds later that evening.\"\"Reddy\" Again.; Another Deed of Blood by One of Our Rulers.
