Newton was elected their first secretary, a post he held until his resignation in 1788. John Evan Hodgson, a later librarian of the Academy, said of him: he was not a great artist, and is  absolutely unknown to fame; but he occupied a very honourable position and performed its duties worthily; he lived in stirring times, with great men as his friends and associates; we are bound to respect his memory, and can only regret that we do not know more of him."]}, {"page": "John Hodgson", "response": ["* John Evan Hodgson (1831\u20131895), English painter"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| John Evan Hodgson   ||align=\"center\" |  1879  ||Librarian 1882\u201395; Professor of Painting 1882\u201395"]}]}}
