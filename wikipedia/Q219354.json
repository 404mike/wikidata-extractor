At club level Rush played for Liverpool from 1980\u20131987 and 1988\u20131996. He is the club's all-time leading goalscorer, having scored a total of 346 goals in all competitions at the club. At international level, Rush made 73 appearances for the Wales national football team and remained the record goalscorer for his country until 2018, with 28 goals between 1980 and 1996.\nAmong the Liverpool players, Rush came 3rd in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop \u2013 an official Liverpool fan poll. He also had short spells with Chester City, Juventus, Leeds United, Newcastle United, Sheffield United, Wrexham and Sydney Olympic. Since retiring as a player in 2000, Rush has had a stint as manager of Chester City (2004\u201305), and has worked as a television football pundit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FA Cup", "response": ["*Most goals (all finals): 5, Ian Rush (Liverpool) (2 in 1986, 2 in 1989, 1 in 1992)"]}, {"page": "Kenny Dalglish", "response": ["In his second season, Dalglish recorded a personal best of 21 league goals for the club and was also named Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year. He did not miss a league game for Liverpool until the 1980\u201381 season, when he appeared in 34 out of 42 league games and scored only eight goals as Liverpool finished fifth in the league, but still won the European Cup and Football League Cup. He recovered his goal-scoring form the following season, and was an ever-present player in the league once again, scoring 13 goals as Liverpool became league champions for the 13th time, and the third time since Dalglish's arrival. It was also around this time that he began to form a potent strike partnership with Ian Rush; Dalglish began to play just off Rush, \"running riot in the extra space afforded to him in the hole\". Dalglish was voted PFA Players' Player of the Year for the 1982\u201383 season, during which he scored 18 league goals as Liverpool retained their title. From 1983 Dalglish became less prolific as a goalscorer, though he remained a regular player.", "With the sale of Ian Rush to Juventus in 1987, Dalglish formed a new striker partnership of new signings John Aldridge and Peter Beardsley for the 1987\u201388 season, and he played only twice in a league campaign which saw Liverpool gain their 17th title. Dalglish did not play in Liverpool's 1988\u201389 campaign, and he made his final league appearance on 5 May 1990 as a substitute against Derby. At 39, he was one of the oldest players ever to play for Liverpool. His final goal had come three years earlier, in a 3\u20130 home league win over Nottingham Forest on 18 April 1987.", "The 1986\u201387 season was trophyless for Liverpool. They lost 2\u20131 to Arsenal in the League Cup final at Wembley. Before the 1987\u201388 season, Dalglish signed two new players: striker Peter Beardsley from Newcastle and winger John Barnes from Watford. He had already purchased goalscorer John Aldridge from Oxford United (a replacement for Ian Rush, who was moving to Italy) in the spring of 1987 and early into the new campaign, bought Oxford United midfielder Ray Houghton. The new-look Liverpool side shaped by Dalglish topped the league for almost the entire season, and had a run of 37 matches unbeaten in all competitions (including 29 in the league; 22 wins and 7 draws) from the beginning of the season to 21 February 1988, when they lost to Everton in the league. Liverpool were crowned champions with four games left to play, having suffered just two defeats from 40 games. However, Dalglish's side lost the 1988 FA Cup Final to underdogs Wimbledon.FA Cup Final 1988  FA-Cup Finals. Retrieved 18 June 2009", "In the summer of 1988, Dalglish re-signed Ian Rush. Liverpool beat Everton 3\u20132 after extra time in the second all-Merseyside FA Cup final in 1989, but was deprived of a second Double in the final game of the season, when Arsenal secured a last-minute goal to take the title from Liverpool. In the 1989\u201390 season Liverpool won their third league title under Dalglish. They missed out on the Double and a third successive FA Cup final appearance when they lost 4\u20133 in extra-time to Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. At the end of the season Dalglish received his third Manager of the Year award. Dalglish resigned as manager of Liverpool on 22 February 1991, two days after a 4\u20134 draw with rivals Everton in an FA Cup fifth round tie at Goodison Park, in which Liverpool surrendered the lead four times. At the time of his resignation, the club were three points ahead in the league and still in contention for the FA Cup.", "In January 1997, Dalglish was appointed manager of Premier League side Newcastle United on a three-and-a-half-year contract, taking over from Kevin Keegan. Dalglish guided the club from fourth position to a runner-up spot in May and a place in the new format of the following season's UEFA Champions League. He then broke up the team which had finished second two years running, selling popular players like Peter Beardsley, Lee Clark, Les Ferdinand and David Ginola and replacing them with ageing stars like John Barnes (34), Ian Rush (36) and Stuart Pearce (35), as well as virtual unknowns like Des Hamilton and Garry Brady. He also made some good long-term signings like Gary Speed and Shay Given. The 1997\u201398 campaign saw Newcastle finish in only 13th place and, despite Dalglish achieving some notable successes during the season (including a 3\u20132 UEFA Champions League win over Barcelona and an FA Cup final appearance against Arsenal), he was dismissed by Freddie Shepherd after two draws in the opening two games of the subsequent 1998\u201399 season, and replaced by former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit. One commentator from The Independent has since written, \"His 20 months at Newcastle United are the only part of Kenny Dalglish's career that came anywhere near failure\"."]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.", "response": ["| Ian Rush || 1993\u20131996", "* Ambassadors:  Ian Rush,  Robbie Fowler,  Michael Owen"]}, {"page": "October 20", "response": ["*  1961   \u2013 Ian Rush, Welsh footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Heysel Stadium disaster", "response": ["According to former Liverpool striker Ian Rush, who signed with Juventus a year later, he saw pronounced improvement in the institutional relationships between both the clubs and their fans during his career in Italy."]}, {"page": "Accrington Stanley F.C.", "response": ["Boy 2: \"It's what Ian Rush drinks.\"", "Boy 1: \"Ian Rush?\""]}, {"page": "Wales", "response": ["Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League, since 1992.

Owen also broke Gary Speed's appearance record having played in all three seasons for the 11-year-olds since he was eight. Owen turned out for the youth team of Mold Alexandra, playing with the under-10s at the age of eight after a local physical education teacher, Howard Roberts, persuaded the league to allow an under-age player. Owen scored on his debut for Mold Alexandra, a 2\u20130 victory over local rivals Bagillt. He went on to score 34 goals in 24 games in his first season with Mold Alexandra.
