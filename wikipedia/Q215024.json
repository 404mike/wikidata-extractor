It has about ten times the mass of the sun (~) yet is radiating 25,000 times the Sun's luminosity. The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 21,820\u00a0K, which gives it the blue-white glow of a B-type star. In 1956 it was identified as a Beta Cephei variable by Bernard Pagel and colleagues, which means it undergoes periodic changes in luminosity because of pulsations in the atmosphere. The variability period is 0.29585 days, or just over 7 hours, 6 minutes. The magnitude varies by about 0.05 magnitudes, or about 5% of its brightness. A 14th magnitude star situated 26\" from Alpha Lupi is listed as a companion in double star catalogues."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2007", "response": ["*Bernard Pagel, British astrophysicist, cancer."]}, {"page": "B.
