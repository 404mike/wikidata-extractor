Schonberg likens Carmen to \"a female Don Giovanni. She would rather die than be false to herself.\"Schonberg, p. 35 The dramatic personality of the character, and the range of moods she is required to express, call for exceptional acting and singing talents. This has deterred some of opera's most distinguished exponents; Maria Callas, though she recorded the part, never performed it on stage.Azaola, pp. 9\u201310 The musicologist Hugh Macdonald observes that \"French opera never produced another femme as fatale as Carmen\", though she may have influenced some of Massenet's heroines.

"]}, {"page": "Georges Bizet", "response": ["The musicologist Hugh Macdonald argues that Bizet's best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived from the 12-movement Jeux d\u2019enfants for piano four-hands (1871) and the musique de sc\u00e8ne for Daudet's play L\u2019Arl\u00e9sienne (1872): Jeux resulted in the Petite suite of 1873, which has five movements (Marche\u2014Berceuse\u2014Impromptu\u2014Duo\u2014Galop), while the musique de sc\u00e8ne resulted in two suites, one from the year of the premiere compiled by Bizet (Pr\u00e9lude\u2014Menuet\u2014Adagietto\u2014Carillon) and the other from 1879 compiled posthumously by Guiraud (Pastorale\u2014Intermezzo\u2014Menuet\u2014Farandole). According to Macdonald, in all three Bizet demonstrates a maturity of style that, had he lived longer, might have been the basis for future great orchestral works."]}, {"page": "Symphonic poem", "response": ["While many symphonic poems may compare in size and scale to symphonic movements (or even reach the length of an entire symphony), they are unlike traditional classical symphonic movements, in that their music is intended to inspire listeners to imagine or consider scenes, images, specific ideas or moods, and not (necessarily) to focus on following traditional patterns of musical form such as sonata form. This intention to inspire listeners was a direct consequence of Romanticism, which encouraged literary, pictorial and dramatic associations in music. According to the musicologist Hugh Macdonald, the symphonic poem met three 19th-century aesthetic goals: it related music to outside sources; it often combined or compressed multiple movements into a single principal section; and it elevated instrumental program music to an aesthetic level that could be regarded as equivalent to, or higher than opera.Macdonald, New Grove (1980), 18:428. The symphonic poem remained a popular composition form from the 1840s until the 1920s, when composers began to abandon the genre.", "Liszt found his method through two compositional practices, which he used in his symphonic poems. The first practice was cyclic form, a procedure established by Beethoven in which certain movements are not only linked but actually reflect one another's content. Liszt took Beethoven's practice one step further, combining separate movements into a single-movement cyclic structure.Walker, Weimar, 357.Searle, \"Orchestral Works\", 281. Many of Liszt's mature works follow this pattern, of which Les Pr\u00e9ludes is one of the best-known examples. The second practice was thematic transformation, a type of variation in which one theme is changed, not into a related or subsidiary theme but into something new, separate and independent. As musicologist Hugh Macdonald wrote of Liszt's works in this genre, the intent was \"to display the traditional logic of symphonic thought;\"Macdonald, New Grove (1980), 18:429. that is, to display a comparable complexity in the interplay of musical themes and tonal 'landscape' to those of the Romantic symphony.", "Composers who developed the symphonic poem after Liszt were mainly Bohemian, Russian, and French; the Bohemians and Russians showed the potential of the form as a vehicle for the nationalist ideas fomenting in their respective countries at this time. Bed\u0159ich Smetana visited Liszt in Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the first performances of the Faust Symphony and the symphonic poem Die Ideale.Clapham, New Grove (1980), 17:392, 399. Influenced by Liszt's efforts, Smetana began a series of symphonic works based on literary subjects\u2014Richard III (1857-8), Wallenstein's Camp (1858-9) and Hakon Jarl (1860\u201361). A piano work dating from the same period, Macbeth a \u010darod\u011bjnice (Macbeth and the Witches, 1859), is similar in scope but bolder in style. Musicologist John Clapham writes that Smetana planned these works as \"a compact series of episodes\" drawn from their literary sources \"and approached them as a dramatist rather than as a poet or philosopher.\"New Grove (1980), 17:399. He used musical themes to represent specific characters; in this manner he more closely followed the practice of French composer Hector Berlioz in his choral symphony Rom\u00e9o et Juliette than that of Liszt.Clapham, New Grove (1980), 17:399. By doing so, Hugh Macdonald writes, Smetana followed \"a straightforward pattern of musical description\".", "In these works, Strauss takes realism in orchestral depiction to unprecedented lengths, widening the expressive functions of program music as well as extending its boundaries. Because of his virtuosic use of orchestration, the descriptive power and vividness of these works is extremely marked. He usually employs a large orchestra, often with extra instruments, and he often uses instrumental effects for sharp characterization, such as portraying the bleating of sheep with cuivr\u00e9 brass in Don Quixote.Macdonald, New Grove (1980), 18:432. Strauss's handling of form is also worth noting, both in his use of thematic transformation and his handling of multiple themes in intricate counterpoint. His use of variation form in Don Quixote is handled exceptionally well, as is his use of rondo form in Till Eulenspiegel. As Hugh Macdonald points out in the New Grove (1980), \"Strauss liked to use a simple but descriptive theme\u2014for instance the three-note motif at the opening of Also sprach Zarathustra, or striding, vigorous arpeggios to represent the manly qualities of his heroes. His love themes are honeyed and chromatic and generally richly scored, and he is often fond of the warmth and serenity of diatonic harmony as balm after torrential chromatic textures, notably at the end of Don Quixote, where the solo cello has a surpassingly beautiful D major transformation of the main theme.\""]}, {"page": "Jean-Philippe Rameau", "response": ["For most of the 19th century, Rameau's music remained unplayed, known only by reputation. Hector Berlioz investigated Castor et Pollux and particularly admired the aria \"Tristes appr\u00eats,\" but \"whereas the modern listener readily perceives the common ground with Berlioz' music, he himself was more conscious of the gap which separated them.\"Hugh Macdonald The Master Musicians: Berlioz (1982) p. 184 French humiliation in the Franco-Prussian War brought about a change in Rameau's fortunes. As Rameau biographer J. Malignon wrote, \"...the German victory over France in 1870\u201371 was the grand occasion for digging up great heroes from the French past. Rameau, like so many others, was flung into the enemy's face to bolster our courage and our faith in the national destiny of France.\"Quoted by Graham Sadler in \"Vincent d'Indy and the Rameau Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes: a case of forgery?\", Early Music, August 1993, p. 418 In 1894, composer Vincent d'Indy founded the Schola Cantorum to promote French national music; the society put on several revivals of works by Rameau. Among the audience was Claude Debussy, who especially cherished Castor et Pollux, revived in 1903: \"Gluck's genius was deeply rooted in Rameau's works... a detailed comparison allows us to affirm that Gluck could replace Rameau on the French stage only by assimilating the latter's beautiful works and making them his own.\" Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (by editing and publishing the Pi\u00e8ces in 1895) and Paul Dukas were two other important French musicians who gave practical championship to Rameau's music in their day, but interest in Rameau petered out again, and it was not until the late 20th century that a serious effort was made to revive his works.

His biographer Hugh Macdonald writes that although Delibes remained a church organist until 1871 (he held several posts, the last of them at the church of Saint Jean-Saint Fran\u00e7ois from 1862), he was \"clearly drawn more to the theatre [and] found his m\u00e9tier at Herv\u00e9's highly successful Folies-Nouvelles\"."]}, {"page": "Daniel Auber", "response": ["The musicologist Hugh Macdonald writes of Auber, \"With Adolphe Adam, he took on the mantle of Adrien Boieldieu and Ferdinand H\u00e9rold, and passed it on in turn to Ambroise Thomas and Jacques Offenbach\".Macdonald, p. 7 Macdonald judges the finest of the Auber-Scribe collaborations to be La Muette de Portici, \"a grand opera that served as a model for the Meyerbeerian genre\".
