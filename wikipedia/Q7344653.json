He was one of the advocates appointed when first the College of Senators was instituted, and was admitted a Lord of Session in Ordinary (Senator of the College of Justice) on 7 November 1537.\nGalbraith was a priest and treasurer of the Chapels Royal at Stirling, in which capacity he received a charter of the lands of Mydwyn Schelis, near Berwick, dated 5 July 1528. He was advocate to Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV of Scotland, and as such made his protest on 1 September 1528 in Parliament against any prejudice to her claim for debt against the Earl of Angus, being occasioned by Angus' forfeiture.\nIn 1543 he was murdered by John Carkettle, a burgess of Edinburgh, and others, on account of favour which he was alleged to have shown to Sir William Sinclair of Herdmanston in a suit before him. The murderers were cited before Parliament, but nothing is known of their fate. He left some reports of cases, which are cited as the Book of Galbraith by the compiler of James Balfour's Practicks.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Galbraith", "response": ["Robert Galbraith may refer to:", "* Robert Galbraith (judge) (died 1543), Scottish Lord of Session", "* Robert Galbraith (1483\u22121544), Scottish logician who taught with Juan de Celaya", "* Robert Galbraith (Medal of Honor) (1878\u20131949), United States Navy Gunner's Mate, 3rd class", "* Robert Galbraith, pen name of J.
