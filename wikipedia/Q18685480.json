They had a lot of cool stuff going on, but it all felt disparate. I wanted more cohesion of ideas, plots, and characters. I would also like to stop the Sam Winchester character assassination and allow him a chance to breath. I would also like clarification on whether that was actually Dean Winchester under the influence of The Mark, because last I checked The Mark made you hyper-aggressive like an animal, not a slut-shaming douchebag. Dean wasn't a demon when he made those comments, so I'm a little confused. Hopefully, The Darkness lives up to my already-high hopes and we get a really excellent eleventh season of Supernatural. Or, it could get bogged down in the execution of so many massive and far-reaching plot threads, and lose grip of many of the storylines, like what happened this season. I would also like a healthy main cast dose of Rowena, who was the best and most interesting part of this solid season of television. Ruth Connell was amazing, and played her part with nuance and menace. I really hope she sticks around for a while.\""]}, {"page": "We Happy Few (Supernatural)", "response": ["Rowena (Ruth Connell) arrives with a witch, Clea (Barbara Eve Harris) to carry on a spell.
