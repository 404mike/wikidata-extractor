He joined the club as a teenager running errands, among other duties, for Tom Graveney.Initially used primarily as an opening bowler for a county that had traditionally relied heavily on spin bowling, Brown took more than 100 wickets in both the 1959 and 1962 seasons and formed an effective new-ball partnership with the England Test player David Smith, used before the Test spin trio of David Allen, John Mortimore and Sam Cook were brought into action. Later in his career, his batting developed significantly, and he passed 1,000 runs in the 1964 season. He was also an excellent close fielder, and in 1966, playing for Gloucestershire against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, he held seven catches in an innings, equalling the world record for a fielder set in 1957 by Micky Stewart. In his first-class cricket career, he scored more than 12,000 runs and took more than 1,200 wickets, holding 493 catches.\nAs an administrator, he succeeded Grahame Parker as Secretary of Gloucestershire on his retirement from first-class cricket in 1976. In 1982 he became Secretary of Somerset, a post that he held for six years, during one of the more turbulent periods in the county\u2019s history, with the decision not to retain Garner and Richards, and the subsequent departure of Ian Botham upsetting many of the club\u2019s supporters.  In 1984 he was appointed Manager of the England Team that toured India and Australia in 1984/85 when the Test Series v India was won 2\u20131, by the team captained by David Gower and the ODI Series by 4\u20131; India were World ODI Cup Champions at that time.  He was also Manager of the England Tour which toured West Indies in 1986.  In 1988 he succeeded Brian Langley as Administration Secretary of the then TCCB (Test and County Cricket Board), now ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) until his retirement in 1997. He was Chairman of Cricket at Gloucestershire County Cricket Club from 1999 until 2007 and President of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club from 2008 to 2011, when he was succeeded by his former team-mate, David Allen. He was nominated by the club\u2019s supporters to be featured in the Gloucestershire Legends Walkway at the County ground which is due to be installed before the start of the 2021 season.Tony Brown died on 27 May 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["In the County Championship match against Sussex at Hove in May, Botham came very close to his maiden century but was dismissed for 97, his highest score to date. The match was drawn. At the end of the month, Somerset played Gloucestershire in a remarkable match at Taunton. Batting first, Somerset scored 333 for seven (innings closed) and then, thanks to six for 25 by Botham, bowled out Gloucestershire for only 79. The follow-on was enforced but Gloucestershire proved a much tougher nut to crack second time around. With Zaheer Abbas scoring 141, they made 372 and left Somerset needing 118 to win. Botham took five for 125 in the second innings for a match analysis of 11 for 150, his maiden 10wM. This match ended the same way as the famous Test at Headingley in 1981 but the boot was on the other foot for Botham here because he was on the team that enforced the follow-on \u2013 and lost. Mike Procter and Tony Brown did the damage and bowled Somerset out for 110 in 42 overs, Gloucestershire winning by just eight runs."]}, {"page": "Tony Brown", "response": ["Tony Brown may refer to:", "*Tony Brown (offensive lineman) (born 1964), American footballer", "*Tony Brown (defensive back, born 1970), American footballer", "*Tony Brown (defensive tackle) (born 1980), American footballer", "*Tony Brown (defensive back, born 1995), American footballer", "*Tony Brown (wide receiver) (born 1997), American footballer", "*Tony Brown (footballer, born 1945), English forward", "*Tony Brown (footballer, born 1958), English centre-back", "*Tony Brown (rugby league) (born 1936), Australian rugby league footballer", "*Tony Brown (rugby union) (born 1975), New Zealand rugby union footballer", "*Tony Brown (English cricketer) (1936\u20132020), English cricketer and administrator", "*Tony Brown (darts player) (born 1945), English darter", "*Tony Brown (basketball) (born 1960), American basketball player and coach", "*Tony Brown (Australian rules footballer) (born 1977)", "*Tony Brown (journalist) (born 1933), American commentator and radio talk show host", "*Tony Brown (record producer) (born 1946), American country music producer and musician", "*Tony Brown (Manx politician) (born 1950), Chief Minister of the Isle of Man", "*Tony Brown (Kansas politician) (born 1961), Democratic member of the Kansas House of Representatives", "*Tony Brown, artist and artistic director of Margolis Brown Adaptors Company", "*Tony Browne (born 1973), Irish hurler"]}, {"page": "1936 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 24 June \u2013 Tony Brown, cricketer and administrator (died 2020)"]}, {"page": "Jack Davey (cricketer)", "response": ["Jack Davey (born 4 September 1944) is a former English cricketer.
