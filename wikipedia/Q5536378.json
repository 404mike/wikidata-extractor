Frank Mountford's injury in January opened the door for the 22-year-old Sellars to take his chance and he filled in a right half easily, playing a vital role as Stoke fell short of winning their first ever League title. In 1947\u201348 Sellars had to fill in around Stoke's injury ravaged team, playing at full-back, right-wing and even centre-forward before finding his place at left-half replacing Jock Kirton despite being right footed. Manager Bob McGrory described Sellars as 'a managers dream' for his willingness to play in any position.
