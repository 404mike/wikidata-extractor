He was noted for his light music compositions. Allmusic journalist, Bradley Torreano stated \"Ray Martin created a legacy for himself in British popular music through his work with his orchestra during the 1950s. His regular appearances on radio and television kept him in the public spotlight, while his position at EMI Records made him an influential producer at the label. His use of pseudonyms has blurred the path of his career through the years, making his many contributions even harder to keep track of. But his original compositions are what really made him popular; tracks like \"Marching Strings\" have become stables [sic] of many public and city bands and orchestras since their release\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ruby Murray", "response": ["After being again spotted by Ray Martin, Murray was signed to Columbia and her first single, \"Heartbeat\", reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1954.

In 1952, she had met an aspiring actor, Roger Moore. The lyrics of \"I'm Walking Behind You\" concern a protagonist walking behind a former lover on their wedding day, and were written by Reid upon his learning that Squires had begun a relationship with the younger Moore. She wanted to record Reid's composition, but her A&R man at Columbia Records, Ray Martin, did not like it, and refused to record the song. Squires discovered that she was not under contract to Columbia, and hired a studio to record the song, paying for the session \u2013 scheduled for 27 February \u2013 herself. Her recording manager, Alan A. Freeman of Polygon Records, and publisher Jimmy Phillips, were unsure about the song, as Eddie Fisher had turned it down already.

In 1943 he was conscripted into the Royal Air Force where he became a wireless operator. After his discharge from the RAF in 1947 he was given the opportunity to go to Cambridge University, but decided to return to BBC Radio as a sound and balance engineer working with many light orchestras. It was by studying scores and their orchestral effects that Duncan gained knowledge about composition and it was through an encounter with the conductor Ray Martin that Duncan had his first piece Vision in Velvet performed. However, the BBC restricted its own employees from having music performed on air. Thus, he concentrated on writing music to be recorded for newsreels and other companies not connected with the BBC. It was also at this point he chose his pseudonym, Trevor Duncan, a reference to a school nickname.", "Ray Martin's approval of his next piece, the famous High Heels encouraged Duncan to approach Boosey & Hawkes, who approved it for recording. The piece enjoyed immediate success, with numerous radio performances and a commercial recordings. In the next few years Duncan composed numerous works and he became one of the most prolific writers of so-called 'mood' music."]}, {"page": "Polygon Records discography", "response": ["*\tP. 1007\tRay Martin and his Concert Orchestra\tMuriella / Gipsy Fiddler\tJun-51", "*\tP. 1040\tRay Martin and his Concert Orchestra\tAt Last!
