He was named the Conference North Manager of the Month for September 2008, in which Tamworth achieved three straight league wins following a draw away to in-form Alfreton. He won the award again for March 2009 after Tamworth were top of the table with five wins and two draws, including a 1\u20130 victory away to title rivals Southport. Mills led Tamworth to promotion back to the Conference Premier after winning the Conference North title in 2008\u201309 and this was confirmed with a 1\u20130 victory over local rivals Hinckley United on 21 April 2009. The final match of the season, a 0\u20130 draw away to AFC Telford United, saw Mills come out of retirement after he came on as a 90th-minute substitute for Rodman. He was given a standing ovation from the travelling supporters in the process. After the end of the season he was named the Conference North Manager of the Year."]}, {"page": "Dale Belford", "response": ["Belford once again returned to Tamworth as a player-coach in March 2011. Following Des Lyttle's departure as Tamworth manager in April 2011, Belford was appointed caretaker manager for the four remaining league games. His first game in charge was away at play-off chasing York City in which he won 2\u20131. His second game in charge ended in 1\u20130 defeat at home to fellow league strugglers Southport. The game ended with three Tamworth players receiving red cards (Liam Mitchell, Richard Tait and Michael Wylde). Belford's next game in charge was an away fixture at promotion chasing Wrexham. Due to the suspensions from the previous match Belford named himself as a substitute. Tamworth goalkeeper Louis Connor got injured in stoppage time and saw Belford donning the goalkeeper jersey once again for the last few minutes of the game. Belford is now the only player to play for Tamworth in four decades (1980's, 1990's, 2000's and 2010s). Belford's fourth and final game in charge saw him take on Forest Green Rovers in a must win game. In a very edgy 90 minutes, Tamworth did win the match 2\u20131 thus meaning Belford had kept the club in the Conference National at the expense of Southport who eventually stayed up due to Rushden & Diamonds entering liquidation."]}, {"page": "Wylde (surname)", "response": ["* Michael Wylde (1987\u2013 ), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Wylde, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Wylde"]}]}}
