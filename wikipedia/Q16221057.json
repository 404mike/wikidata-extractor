He is the current Derry vice-captain.\nMcCusker plays his club football for Ballinderry Shamrocks. He was instrumental in helping Ballinderry win the 2002 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship. He has also won four Derry Championships and an Ulster Senior Club Football Championship with the club.\nHe is seen as a tough, old-fashioned full-back, but is versatile and can play in almost any position. Adrian McGuckin said of McCusker \"He has a great footballing brain, his positional sense is unreal and he never wastes a ball\". Fellow Derry full back and captain Kevin McCloy says \"I'd rather run into a train than run into Niall McCusker\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paddy Bradley", "response": ["Bradley and Derry again reached the National League final in 2009, but were defeated by Kerry.
