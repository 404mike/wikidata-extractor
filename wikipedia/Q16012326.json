He scored 2,346 runs with a highest score of 101 and took five wickets with a best performance of two for 32.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Phelps (cricketer)", "response": ["He batted at six in each of his four innings, but was not a success: scores of 3, 7, 11 and 4 were hardly what the county was looking for. He was never called upon to bowl his medium pace at first-class level, but he did take a single catch, to dismiss Leicestershire's Harold Riley."]}, {"page": "Harold Riley", "response": ["Harold Riley may refer to:", "*Harold Riley (artist) (born 1934), English artist", "*Harold Riley (footballer) (1909\u20131982), English footballer", "*Harold Riley (cricketer) (1902\u20131989), English cricketer"]}]}}
