Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control.

Usually this signals the end of the group until potential future reunions. Examples of this include Michael Jackson from The Jackson 5, Donny Osmond from The Osmonds, Ricky Martin from Menudo, Justin Timberlake from *NSYNC, and Ronan Keating from Boyzone. Sometimes the most successful solo star from a band is not the most popular member such as Robbie Williams as opposed to lead singer Gary Barlow from Take That.

This was followed by the Greatest Hits compilation in 1996, which contained a new recording, a cover of the Bee Gees' \"How Deep Is Your Love\". The single went on to become what was to be the band's final UK number one until their 2006 comeback a decade later. Take That gave what was thought to be their final performance in April 1996 at Amsterdam. Following the band's announcement, millions of their fans were distraught around the world and in the UK alone, teenage girls threatened suicide and were seen lining streets in tears, to the point that telephone hotlines were set up by the government to deal with counselling them. After the band broke up, highly respected music figures such as Elton John noted that Take That were different from other boy bands before and after them, in that they wrote their own material through Gary Barlow. Barlow is one of only a small number of people who have won an Ivor Novello award during their time in a boy band, with George Michael whilst in Wham! and Tony Mortimer whilst in East 17 being two others who have achieved this feat. Take That had also left a legacy of being immaculate performers with a very high work ethic, causing them to be voted in as the greatest boy band of all time.", "After working with the band on new material in Los Angeles, on 15 July 2010 Robbie Williams announced he was returning to Take That.

Take That: the original lineup, have written and recorded a new album for release later this year.\" The statement went on to say, \"Following months of speculation Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen, and Robbie Williams confirmed they have been recording a new studio album as a five-piece, which they will release in November.\" The lead single from Take That's album Progress was announced as \"The Flood\" and was released 7 November as a digital download, and on 8 November as a physical copy, with the album released a week later on 15 November.Take That official 27 October 2010  The single peaked at number 2 in the UK Singles Charts and to date has sold over 500,000 copies in the UK alone.
