To mark the changeover, 1983 was celebrated as \"Beautiful Britain in Bloom Year\".

It was founded in 1958 as Greensitt Bros., but control was later assumed by Sir Lawrie Barratt. It was originally based in Newcastle upon Tyne but is now located at David Wilson's former offices in Coalville, Leicestershire. It has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 1968, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.", "In 1953, Lawrie Barratt, an accountant who was frustrated at the high purchase prices of houses for first-time buyers, bought five acres of land at Darras Hall, near Newcastle upon Tyne and built his own home on the site. Following this experience, he joined forces with Lewis Greensitt, a Newcastle builder, to establish a house building business, which was initially known as Greensitt Brothers, in 1958.", "Central to Barratt's expansion was its high-profile marketing, with national advertising, featuring Patrick Allen and a helicopter. Barratt provided starter homes for the first-time buyer and offered part-exchange to those trading up.  In the year to June 1983, Barratt sold a record 16,500 houses making it by far the largest housebuilder in the country. In 1983 and 1984 Barratt was hit by two successive ITV World in Action programmes, the first criticising timber-framed housing and the latter, starter homes. Within two years, unit sales had more than halved. Lawrie Barratt led a total restructuring of the company, abandoning timber-framed construction, launching a new product range, and concentrating on the more profitable trade-up market. In the late 1980s, Margaret Thatcher famously purchased a house on one of Barratt's most upmarket estates, in Dulwich, London.", "In 1991, the company was badly hit by the recession and recalled Lawrie Barratt from retirement: he retired for good in 1997 and remained life president until his death in December 2012. In 2004 the company sold Barratt American, its US operation, established in the 1980s in California. Following the house price boom in the later 1990s and early 2000s, which saw a number of Barratt's largest rivals, such as Persimmon, George Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow all acquire rivals to increase in size, Barratt broke its tradition of 30 years and acquired Wilson Bowden, best known for its David Wilson Homes brand, for \u00a32.7 billion in 2007. This brought the David Wilson, Ward Homes and Wilson Bowden Developments brands to the group."]}, {"page": "Lawrie", "response": ["* Lawrie Barratt (1927\u20132012), founder of Barratt Developments, one of the largest housebuilders in the United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "Lawrence Barratt", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lawrie Barratt"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Sir Lawrie Barratt, 85, businessman (Barratt Developments)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2012", "response": ["*Sir Lawrie Barratt, 85, English businessman (Barratt Developments).Sir Lawrie Barratt dies, aged 85"]}, {"page": "Barratt (surname)", "response": ["*Lawrie Barratt (1927\u20132012), founder of Barratt Developments, housebuilders"]}]}}
