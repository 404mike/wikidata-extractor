He rose to be Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. His discussions led to much controversy: in one book he proposed that stars cannot have planets as this would reduce the importance of Christ's appearance on this planet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Utilitarianism", "response": ["The now forgotten significance of Paley can be judged from the title of Thomas Rawson Birks's 1874 work Modern Utilitarianism or the Systems of Paley, Bentham and Mill Examined and Compared."]}, {"page": "Staveley, Derbyshire", "response": ["* Thomas Rawson Birks, Cambridge Professor was born here 1810."]}, {"page": "Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy", "response": ["* Thomas Rawson Birks (1872)Entry on Janus"]}, {"page": "Judas Cyriacus", "response": ["* Edward Bickersteth Birks (Esq., M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, son of Thomas Rawson Birks). \"CYRIACUS (6)\".

In this, he followed the earlier influence of Johann Heinrich Alsted in Diatribe mille annis apocalypticis (Frankfurt, 1627), and Joseph Mede in Clavis Apocalypticae. Departing from that traditional historicist hermeneutic, the premillennialism movement came to include futurist and dispensational contributors such as Hugh M'Neile, Edward Irving and John Nelson Darby.Robert K.
