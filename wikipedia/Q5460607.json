In Captain Billy, a one-act curtain raiser that accompanied The Vicar of Bray, she played the small role of Polly in May and June 1892. She originated another small role, Deborah, in Haddon Hall in September 1892, and in April 1893 she had the opportunity to play the leading role of Dorothy Vernon in that opera for several nights until the end of that opera's run. In 1893, she alo appeared in another small part, Winifred, in Mr. Jericho, by Harry Greenbank and Ernest Ford, a curtain raiser to Haddon Hall and Jane Annie, also at the Savoy Theatre. In 1893, she was supposed to create the small role of Phylla in the original production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited, but her understudy, Miss Howell-Hersee, sang the role from 7 October until 7 November 1893, when Easton took over the part.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Florence Easton", "response": ["thumb|Florence Easton", "Florence Easton (25 October 1882 \u2013 13 August 1955) was a popular English dramatic soprano in the early 20th century. She was one of the most versatile singers of all time.  She sang more than 100 parts, covering a wide range of styles and periods, from Mozart, Meyerbeer, Gounod, Verdi, Wagner, Puccini, Strauss, Schreker and Krenek. In Wagner she sang virtually every soprano part, large and small from Senta onwards, including the G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung Br\u00fcnnhilde.", "There is no connection between Florence Easton and the singer Robert Easton, born 1898 in Sunderland.", "Florence Easton was the elder daughter of John Thomas Easton and Isabella Yarrow, and niece of Fletcher Easton. Known professionally as 'the nightingale of South Bank', she was born on 25 October 1882 at 52 Napier Street, South Bank, Middlesbrough (many biographies show her birthdate incorrectly as 1884).  Her parents left England when she was 5 years old and settled with Florence (then known as Flossie) and her younger brother in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Flossie sang in the choir of Parkdale Methodist Church, where her father was choirmaster and her mother was organist.  Her musical talent became evident in early childhood and she had piano, organ and singing lessons with JDA Tripp and Mr Harrison.  She appeared publicly as a pianist when she was 8 years old.", "thumb|left|A portrait of Florence Easton taken during her engagement years with the Chicago Opera.", "thumb|right|Florence Easton as Lauretta at the world premiere of Gianni Schicchi, 14 December 1918.", "Florence Easton was famous for her ability to take an unknown part at 8 in the morning and perform it flawlessly in public 12 hours later. Frequently she was called upon at the last moment to substitute for some leading soprano momentarily indisposed.  She sang her first Isolde without a single rehearsal, called to do so at the zero hour.  In the middle of the 1929 season however, her memory suddenly failed her, and she asked to be released from her contract.  She announced she would sing in opera no more, and retired to a house in Hampstead, London.  She married Stanley Roberts, a New York banker and executive of the Celanese Corporation of America and baritone singer, in 1931.", "On one occasion Florence Easton was engaged to sing the title role in Madama Butterfly in Washington, D.C., a place celebrated for the strictest child labour laws of any city in the country.  The child 'Trouble' (Butterfly's son who appears only in the last act), is always recruited locally, and a resourceful stage manager from somewhere produced a midget.  Nobody told Mme. Easton, lest she be a bit squeamish.  It is customary for the child playing Trouble to be introduced to the soprano at the first intermission to get him (more often her) accustomed to the Japanese costume and makeup.  Mme. Easton asked the traditional three questions:\"Would you like to go to the bathroom?\" \u2013 \"No\".\"Would you like some chocolate?\"   \u2013 \"No\".\"How old are you?\" \u2013 \"Forty two\" the little fellow piped up.But this was nothing to Easton\u00b9s confusion in the last act.  When she pressed him to her ample bosom he didn\u00b9t want to let go.", "Florence Easton made more than 100 records in the 1920s and 1930s.  She recorded for Odeon, Aeolian-Vocalion and for Brunswick, initially recording acoustically, but electrically from 1926.  She embraced opera, operetta, sacred songs and popular ballads.  She recorded six operatic items for Edison (1927).  One of her most important Wagnerian records was made for HMV in 1932: the superb Siegfried \"Br\u00fcnnhilde\" opposite Lauritz Melchior (Covent Garden, 1932) \"Heil dir Sonne! Heil dir Licht!\" (the best recording in her own estimation).
