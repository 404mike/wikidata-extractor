The name \"Miles\" is associated with two distinct companies that Miles was involved in and is also attached to many non-aviation products such as the Biro pen, photocopiers and book binding machinery. Throughout his life, he was known as \"Miles\" and never by his first name, even to his own family, although Don Brown refers to him as \"F.G.\", presumably to distinguish him from his brother George.", "link_mentions": {}}}
