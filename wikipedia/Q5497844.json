The name \"Miles\" is associated with two distinct companies that Miles was involved in and is also attached to many non-aviation products such as the Biro pen, photocopiers and book binding machinery. Throughout his life, he was known as \"Miles\" and never by his first name, even to his own family, although Don Brown refers to him as \"F.G.\", presumably to distinguish him from his brother George.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ballpoint pen", "response": ["In 1941, the B\u00edr\u00f3 brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany and moved to Argentina, where they formed \"B\u00edr\u00f3 Pens of Argentina\" and filed a new patent in 1943. Their pen was sold in Argentina as the \"Birome\" from the names B\u00edr\u00f3 and Meyne, which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country. This new design was licensed by the British engineer Frederick George Miles and manufactured by his company Miles Aircraft, to be used by Royal Air Force aircrew as the \"Biro\". Ballpoint pens were found to be more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes, where fountain pens were prone to leak."]}, {"page": "Miles Aircraft", "response": ["Miles was the name used between 1943 and 1961 to market the aircraft of British engineer Frederick George Miles, who, with his wife \u2013 aviator and draughtswoman Maxine \"Blossom\" Miles (n\u00e9e Forbes-Robertson) \u2013 and his brother George, designed numerous light civil and military aircraft and a range of curious prototypes."]}, {"page": "Miles (surname)", "response": ["* Frederick George Miles, British aircraft designer and constructor"]}, {"page": "List of Worthing inhabitants", "response": ["* Frederick George Miles, aircraft designer and manufacturer, was born in the town in 1903 and died in the town in 1976."]}, {"page": "C. F. Caunter", "response": ["In 1932, Caunter published a design for a 60\u00a0hp two-stroke light aero engine. Frederick George Miles of the Phillips & Powis Aircraft company (later Miles Aircraft Ltd) built a test prototype of the Caunter engine and successful tests were carried out at Reading Aerodrome in Woodley, Berkshire, during the late 1930s. The Caunter engine performed well at Woodley with Miles, who proposed a company to produce it, to install in an aeroplane that would be sold in large numbers like Ford cars."]}, {"page": "F.G. Miles", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick George Miles"]}, {"page": "Southern Martlet", "response": ["The Southern Martlet was the first aircraft designed by teams led Frederick George Miles, whose company was Southern Aircraft of Shoreham. It was a modified Avro Baby, differing in the tail unit, undercarriage and engine, the 85\u00a0hp A.B.C. Hornet air-cooled flat four. Like the Baby, it was a single-bay staggered tractor biplane, with fixed two-wheel main and tail-skid undercarriage. The undercarriage was a combination of \"oleo and coil-spring shock absorbing gear\" designed by Basil Henderson of Hendy Aircraft, Shoreham. The prototype G-AAII made its first public appearance on 30 August 1929 at London Air Park, Hanworth, and proved to be a very manoeuvrable sports machine."]}, {"page": "Thames Estuary Airport", "response": ["In 1943 the aircraft designer Frederick George Miles of Miles Aircraft and long time associate, architect Guy Morgan suggested the construction of a new airport, including a flying boat base, between Cliffe and Allhallows. Intended to serve 8 million passengers per year, the cost of the scheme was estimated at \u00a320 million.  It was planned with a central Terminus, three concrete runways each two and a half miles long and was intended to operate 24 hours a day."]}, {"page": "Maxine Blossom Miles", "response": ["Maxine \"Blossom\" Miles, born 22 September 1901 as Maxine Forbes-Robertson, was a British aviation engineer, socialite, and businesswoman.  She was born into a well-known family of actors.  She became interested in aviation in the 1920s, and married her flight instructor, Frederick George Miles.  Together they eventually founded Miles Aircraft Ltd, where she was also a draughtswoman and aircraft designer.", "In February 1931, the couple were having a low-wing monoplane built at Shoreham Airport. They planned to fly to India, where Freeman-Thomas's father had been appointed Viceroy. On 7 December 1931, The New York Times reported that Viscount Ratendone (Inigo Freeman-Thomas) was seeking a divorce from Viscountess Ratendone (Maxine Freeman-Thomas). Freeman-Thomas named Frederick George Miles, flying instructor, as co-defendant with Maxine in an undefended suit and was granted a decree nisi. Maxine and Inigo Freeman-Thomas were divorced in 1932. Both Maxine and Freeman-Thomas had been members of the Southern Aero Club of Shoreham, where Miles was a director and instructor. Miles flew his Simmonds Spartan aircraft to South Africa to escape the situation and consider his position; almost immediately he returned, and he and Maxine were soon married."]}, {"page": "George Miles", "response": ["* George Herbert Miles, brother of Frederick George Miles of Miles Aircraft Ltd."]}, {"page": "Southern Aircraft Company", "response": ["#redirectFrederick George Miles"]}]}}
