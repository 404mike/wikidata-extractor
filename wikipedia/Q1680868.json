He became Chief of the Imperial General Staff three months after the start of the First World War, but was ineffectual and was replaced in September 1915 following the failure of the Dardanelles campaign.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet", "response": ["However, the failure of the Gallipoli Campaign, and the Shell Shortage to which it contributed, led to Conservative ministers joining the new Coalition Government, which boosted Wilson's prospects. Leo Maxse, H. A. Gwynne and the radical Josiah Wedgwood MP, impressed by Wilson's support for conscription and the abandonment of Gallipoli, tipped him as a potential CIGS in place of James Wolfe-Murray, but Archibald Murray was appointed instead (September 1915). Wilson's personal relations with Asquith and Kitchener also appear to have become more cordial around this time.Jeffery 2006, p. 150. From July 1915 Asquith and Kitchener began to consult him regularly."]}, {"page": "Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet", "response": ["Robertson later wrote in his memoirs that he was not close to Kitchener, having only ever served with him in South Africa. With Asquith's Coalition Government in danger of breaking up over conscription (which Robertson supported), he blamed Kitchener for the excessive influence which civilians like Churchill and Haldane had come to exert over strategy, allowing ad hoc campaigns to develop in Sinai, Mesopotamia and Salonika, and not asking the General Staff (whose chief James Wolfe-Murray was intimidated by Kitchener) to study the feasibility of any of these campaigns. Robertson had urged the King's adviser Stamfordham (probably June or July 1915) that a stronger General Staff was needed in London, otherwise \"disaster\" would ensue. By October 1915 Robertson had come to support greater coordination of plans with the French and was in increasingly close touch with Charles Callwell, who had been recalled from retirement to become Director of Military Operations.Woodward 1998, pp. 14, 16\u201317, 20"]}]}}
