In 1988, Geisler and John Roberdeau met with Malick in Paris about writing and directing a movie based on D. M. Thomas' 1981 novel The White Hotel.

Under the stress of the intricate questions his later fiction poses, his sentences stretch, and turn a bit stentorian. A diagrammatic grayness creeps in as the complications thicken.\" Updike found the book \"an orgy of argumentation...this hard-pressed reviewer was reminded not only of Shaw but of Hamlet, which also has too many characters, numerous long speeches, and a vacillating, maddening hero who in the end shows the right stuff.\" Updike closed with the admonition, \"It should be read by anyone who cares about (1) Israel and its repercussions, (2) the development of the postmodern, deconstruction-minded novel, (3) Philip Roth.\" In The New York Times Book Review,D.M.
