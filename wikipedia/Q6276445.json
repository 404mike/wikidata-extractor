However, no move materialised and Morais continued to search for a club. In October 2010, Morais joined League One club Oldham Athletic on non-contract terms, making his debut as a second-half substitute the next day, in a 4\u20132 victory over Plymouth Argyle. After just two first-team appearances for Oldham, Morais did not play again until January 2011, as a result of being sent-off in a reserve match and consequently having to serve a three-match ban. Despite this, Oldham manager Paul Dickov stated the club had offered Morais a permanent contract for the remainder of the season. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20131 win over Brentford at Boundary Park on 22 January 2011, scoring with a \"drilled low shot\" to double Oldham's advantage and put them on the edge of the play-off places. Three days later, he scored again, this time netting from the edge of the area in a 1\u20131 draw with Walsall. In February 2011, Oldham announced that Morais had signed a contract until the end of the season, with an option of a further year. His third goal of the season came in a 3\u20132 home loss to Sheffield Wednesday, with Morais' deflected effort reducing the deficit as Oldham trailed from two early goals. His season ended prematurely after he was sent-off in the club's home draw against Walsall in April 2011, with Morais being shown the red card for a challenge on Walsall's Jordan Cook. He made 23 appearances during the 2010\u201311 season, scoring three times."]}, {"page": "Craig Mackail-Smith", "response": ["Mackail-Smith suffered a further setback in pre-season ahead of 2016\u201317 when he underwent surgery to insert a pin in his fractured tibia, ruling him out for another six weeks.

Ed Upson's fifth goal of the season was enough to see him included in the League One Team of the Week for the second time this season. Following the game it was reported that The Football Association were investigated an incident at the end of the match between Yeovil captain Jamie McAllister and Tranmere winger and former Yeovil player Abdulai Bell-Baggie, with the papers claiming that Bell-Baggie had been racially abused by McAllister. Manager Gary Johnson told the BBC that captain Jamie McAllister was \"upset\" to be the subject of an inquiry by the Football Association, and would deny any allegations against him. On 9 March, Yeovil played out a goalless draw away at relegation threatened Hartlepool United. On 11 March, Yeovil signed ex-Chelsea full-back and left sided player Ben Gordon on one-month contract as cover for captain Jamie McAllister. Gordon made his full debut the following day replacing the injured Sam Foley, despite taking a two-goal lead after just 18 minutes thanks to goals from Byron Webster and top goalscorer Paddy Madden, a second half turnaround from Crawley Town rescued them a 2\u20132 draw and ended Yeovil's seven game home winning run. On 14 March, Yeovil Town announced that the club had recorded a profit of \u00a353,379 for the year ended 30 June 2012, with turnover up by 5% at \u00a33.1m.

The next day Yeovil played Swindon Town at Huish Park live on Sky Sports, The Glovers suffered a 2\u20130 defeat at the hands of their promotion rivals and slipped out of the play-off places on goal difference. On 23 March, Yeovil faced Carlisle United at Brunton Park despite leading 3\u20131 with seconds left of normal time courtesy of a first goal for Yeovil from Kevin Dawson and goals from Paddy Madden and James Hayter, they conceded two late goals to draw 3\u20133. On 26 March, Queens Park Rangers left winger and striker \u00c1ngelo Balanta joined the club on loan until the end of the season to provide attacking cover at the club. Kevin Dawson's performance in the Carlisle game was enough to earn him a second nomination of the season to the Football League Team of the Week. On 27 March, Matthew Dolan unexpectedly returned to the club on loan from Middlesbrough until the end of the season, and the following day it was confirmed Reuben Reid would remain at Plymouth Argyle on loan until the end of the season as well. Yeovil played fellow play-off chasers Walsall at home on Good Friday, but both sides lacked attacking quality as a game of few chances ended goalless. The result meant Yeovil had won just one of their last eight games but still remained seventh just a point outside the play-off positions."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Charlton Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| Jordan Cook", "|Jordan Cook", "| Jordan Cook", "| Jordan Cook"]}]}}
