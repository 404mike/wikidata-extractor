His preoccupation with drawing began very early, probably around age three, since there are drawings on the fly-leaves of books from that period. His natural history interest began around age six.\nWatercolor was the basic medium for his work, with occasional gouache for highlighting or detail. His preferred working surface was a \"fashion\" type board, CS2 \"not surface\" being the favorite.\nOvenden used a body-live, pinned, or preserved specimen, to work from.  He also used photographs, although these vary greatly in terms of color bias. He used textbook or specialist handbooks to confirm details of mouth parts, wing venation, and other identification features.\nOvenden began his studies at Hornsey College of Art in 1938, with a five-year break from 1942 to December 1946 in the Royal Engineers most of which was spent in North Africa and Italy. In 1950 he began working as a freelance illustrator, for London Zoo, The Radio Times, Crawfords Advertising Agency and Collins. A lot of time was also spent working with fellow ex-students at the Waverly Studio.\nIn 1961 Ovenden went to work on the part-work, Understanding Science, where he met Michael Chinery, who became a friend. With Chinery he began a new phase of work for William Collins, first on Field Guide to the Insects of Britain & Northern Europe, then the ground-breaking Reptiles & Amphibians of Britain & Europe. This was followed by a number of other books for Collins, including entry-level hand guides to Wild Animals and The Sea Coast.\nIn 1987 ten plates were prepared for Harley books, Grasshoppers and Allied Insects of Britain and Ireland. There followed the Collins Guide to Freshwater Life and a small share in the Collins Fungi Guide. Ovenden was commissioned by the Open University to prepare a poster accompanying David Attenborough's BBC series Life in Cold Blood. After a period of 15 years' work, Gal\u00e1pagos, a Guide to the Animals and Plants finally went to print after the addition of illustrations of two other recently discovered rodents and the elusive pink iguana.\nOvenden died in November 2019 at the age of 97.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The New Dinosaurs", "response": ["The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution is a 1988 speculative evolution book written by Scottish geologist Dougal Dixon and illustrated by several illustrators including Amanda Barlow, Peter Barrett, John Butler, Jeane Colville, Anthony Duke, Andy Farmer, Lee Gibbons, Steve Holden, Philip Hood, Martin Knowelden, Sean Milne, Denys Ovenden and Joyce Tuhill. The book also features a foreword by Desmond Morris.
