Biographer Andrew Lycett calls him a \"spendthrift playboy\" who (with his brother Denis) \"used the Conan Doyle estate as a milch-cow\".He married Danish-born Anna Andersen, and was his father's literary executor after his mother died in 1940.

In 2011, Anthony Horowitz published a Sherlock Holmes novel, The House of Silk, presented as a continuation of Conan Doyle's work and with the approval of the Conan Doyle estate; a follow-up, Moriarty, appeared in 2014.
