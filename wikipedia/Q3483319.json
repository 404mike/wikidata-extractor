Earlier in his career he worked as a film editor.\nCole was educated at the London School of Economics (LSE), and entered the film industry as a scenario reader for Stoll Picture Productions, a company founded by Sir Oswald Stoll. A longstanding friend of director Thorold Dickinson, he edited Dickinson's The High Command (1936) and Gaslight (1940) and Alberto Cavalcanti's Went the Day Well? (1942). Cavalcanti was \"a joy\" to work with and later in his life Cole remained pleased with his work on the film, stating that it was \"very tightly edited by me\".The longest portion of Cole's career though was as a producer, initially credited as an associate producer, for Ealing Studios (where he was employed for eleven years) and the television production company ITC. For ITC he produced Danger Man (US: Secret Agent, 1964\u201367) and Man in a Suitcase (1967\u201368). Later he supervised The Adventures of Black Beauty (1972\u201374) and Dick Turpin (1979\u201382) for London Weekend Television, the latter via the Gatetarn company he founded with Richard Carpenter and Paul Knight.Sidney Cole was politically engaged through much of his career. He was involved in making documentaries on the Spanish Civil War with Dickinson and employed nearly two-dozen blacklisted American writers on The Adventures of Robin Hood (1955\u201360), a series whose executive producer Hannah Weinstein had herself chosen exile in London because of McCarthyism. With Peter Proud, Cole founded the ACTT union.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robin of Sherwood", "response": ["Richard Carpenter had previously worked with producer Paul Knight on two other dramas involving historical adventure, Dick Turpin (1979\u20131982) and Smuggler (1981).James Chapman, Swashbucklers: The Costume Adventure Series. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2015. , (pp. 138, 152\u2013165)  For their next project, Carpenter and Knight decided to have their production company Gatetarn do an adaptation of the Robin Hood legend. With the aid of television producer Sidney Cole, Carpenter and Knight were able to create a production deal for the show. Goldcrest Films, the US network Showtime, HTV and Gatetarn agreed to fund the series.Bernstein, Abbie. \"Legends of the Hooded Man : Richard Carpenter interview\". Starlog Magazine, issue 151, February 1990, (pgs.30-33,64). Robin of Sherwood was more expensive than Carpenter and Knight's previous series; each episode of Robin of Sherwood cost around \u00a3500,000 to film. Filming on Robin of Sherwood began in 1983. The show premiered in 1984, on ITV in the UK and on Showtime in the United States. There were three series, composed of a two-hour opening episode and 24 one-hour long episodes, although the pilot is sometimes screened as two one-hour episodes. The episodes comprising \"The Swords of Wayland\" were transmitted as one episode in the UK on their original screening, on a bank holiday weekend in 1985. The show was shot on film and almost entirely on location, mostly in the northeast and southwest of England; HTV West in Bristol was the base of operations, and most of the filming was done in and around Bristol and its surrounding counties. Primary locations were the Blaise Castle Estate in North Bristol and Vassals Park to the south.
