Despite the unusually unpleasantly cold and windy conditions, the race attracted a large crowd which included the King. The favourite caused some concern by sweating profusely before the race, but started well and settled behind the leaders as Silver Mount set the early pace. Weston sent the filly into the lead a furlong out and a \"tremendous struggle\" ensued as first Qurrat-Al-Ain, then Sister Clover and finally Torchere launched strong challenges. Fair Isle displayed \"doggedness\" and \"superb battling qualities\" to prevail by a short head and a neck from Torchere and Sister Clover."]}]}}
