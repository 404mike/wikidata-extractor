By accepting the treaty in January and abandoning the republic, the D\u00e1il majority had effectively deserted the Army Executive. In his reply, Mulcahy rejected this interpretation. Then, in a debate on defence, MacEntee suggested that supporting the Army Executive \"... even if it meant the scrapping of the Treaty and terrible and immediate war with England, would be better than the civil war which we are beginning at present apparently.\" MacEntee's supporters added that the many robberies complained of by Mulcahy on 26 April were caused by the lack of payment and provision by the D\u00e1il to the volunteers."]}, {"page": "Taoiseach", "response": ["|rowspan=2 |Se\u00e1n MacEntee"]}, {"page": "Patrick Hillery", "response": ["The new Taoiseach, Se\u00e1n Lemass, began the process of retiring de Valera's Ministers, many of whom had served in every Fianna F\u00e1il cabinet since 1932. Under Lemass, party elders such as James Ryan, Se\u00e1n MacEntee and Paddy Smith, retired and a new generation of politicians were introduced to government, such as Brian Lenihan, Donogh O'Malley, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney. Key among this new breed of politician was Hillery, who became Minister for Education in 1959, succeeding Jack Lynch in that post."]}, {"page": "Se\u00e1n Lemass", "response": ["In 1951, Fianna F\u00e1il returned to power as a minority government. Lemass again returned as Minister for Industry and Commerce. Lemass believed that a new economic policy was needed, however, de Valera disagreed. Se\u00e1n MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, tried to deal with the crisis in the balance of payments. He was also unsympathetic to a new economic outlook. In 1954, the government fell and was replaced by the Second Inter-Party Government."]}, {"page": "Jack Lynch", "response": ["In 1965, Lemass was once again re-elected Taoiseach. The big change was the retirement of such political heavyweights as James Ryan and Se\u00e1n MacEntee, with Lynch taking over from the former as Minister for Finance. This appointment was particularly significant because Lemass was coming to the end of his premiership and wanted to prepare a successor. As a result, Lynch took charge of the second most important position in the government, gaining widespread experience in a number of affairs, and accompanying Lemass to London to sign one of the most important trade agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. One occasion in which Lynch's authority was seen to be undermined as Minister for Finance was when the Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, announced that the government would provide free secondary school education for all. This proposal had not been discussed at Cabinet level as would be required to fund such a service. It subsequently transpired that Lemass had previously agreed the decision without cabinet discussion as was required."]}, {"page": "Anglo-Irish Treaty", "response": ["The main dispute was centred on the status as a dominion (as represented by the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity) rather than as an independent republic, but partition was a significant matter for dissent.

The families of Patrick McGilligan and Ernest Blythe, were also frequent visitors to the FitzGerald household. FitzGerald's mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent, although later in life she converted to Catholicism. Her son would later describe his political objective as the creation of a pluralist Ireland where the northern Protestants of his mother's family tradition and the southern Catholics of his father's could feel equally at home."]}, {"page": "T\u00e1naiste", "response": ["| Se\u00e1n MacEntee"]}, {"page": "Frank Aiken", "response": ["Aiken's continuing bitterness towards Blythe was in contrast with the cross-party friendship which had developed between their colleagues Se\u00e1n MacEntee (anti-treaty) and Desmond FitzGerald (pro-treaty) who, after the divide, re-established relationships and ensured their children held no civil war bitterness. The great rivals \u00c9amon de Valera and W. T. Cosgrave, after years of enmity, also became reconciled in the 1960s. However Aiken refused to reconcile with former friends who had taken sides in the Civil War."]}, {"page": "George Colley", "response": ["Colley's rise through politics was remarkable; after only five years in the D\u00e1il, he was already in a position to contest the leadership of Fianna F\u00e1il. He was the favoured candidate of party elders such as Se\u00e1n MacEntee and Frank Aiken, the latter managing Colley's campaign and annoyed at Lemass's quick decision to retire before Colley had built up his support. Colley was considered to be in the same mould as the party founders, concerned with issues such as the peaceful re-unification of the country and the cause of the Irish language. A third candidate, Neil Blaney, also stated his interest in the leadership if a suitable candidate could not be found. However, both Haughey and Blaney withdrew when the Minister for Finance, Jack Lynch, announced his candidacy. Colley did not back down and the leadership issue went to a vote for the first time in the history of the Fianna F\u00e1il party."]}, {"page": "James Ryan (Irish politician)", "response": ["Following the 1957 general election, Fianna F\u00e1il were back in power and de Valera's cabinet had a new look to it. In a clear message that there would be a change to economic policy Ryan, a close ally of Se\u00e1n Lemass, was appointed Minister for Finance, replacing the conservative Se\u00e1n MacEntee. The first sign of a new economic approach came in 1958, when Ryan brought the First Programme for Economic Development to the cabinet table. This plan, the brainchild of T. K. Whitaker, recognised that Ireland would have to move away from self-sufficiency towards free trade. It also proposed that foreign firms should be given grants and tax breaks to set up in Ireland.", "When Se\u00e1n Lemass succeeded de Valera as Taoiseach in 1959, Ryan was retained in the Finance portfolio. Lemass also wanted to reward him for his loyalty by naming him T\u00e1naiste, however, the new leader felt obliged to appoint Se\u00e1n MacEntee, one of the party elders to the position. Ryan continued to implement the First Programme throughout the early 1960s, achieving a record growth rate of 4 per cent by 1963. That year an even more ambitious Second Programme was introduced, however, it overreached and had to be abandoned. In spite of this the annual growth rate averaged five per cent, the highest achieved since independence."]}, {"page": "Gerald Boland", "response": ["A cabinet reshuffle in 1936 saw Boland become Minister for Lands, before later taking on responsibility for Fisheries. As Minister for Lands Boland introduced a land act in 1939 which reformed land distribution. The act broadened the criteria by which the state could take control over undeveloped land while offering the tenant of the land more favourable terms of compensation. Boland was critical of Lemass' policy of centralising industrial development in Dublin, he instead wished to see a more decentralised economy based around food production. The differing viewpoint caused a rift between Boland and Lemass, but despite this Boland favoured Lemass's policy of state intervention in the economy over Se\u00e1n MacEntee's more Laissez-faire approach."]}, {"page": "1918 Irish general election", "response": ["|Se\u00e1n MacEntee"]}]}}
