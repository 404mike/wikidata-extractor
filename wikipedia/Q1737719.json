Lord alerted the two that he had been recruited for the Roundabout project, after which Simper and Little suggested guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whom Lord had never met. Simper had known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted around the same time as one of Blackmore's early bands, the Dominators.Thompson, Dave (2004). \"Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story\" p.5.

New Zealander Gary Thain, a then member of Keef Hartley Band, joined Uriah Heep as a permanent member in February 1972 halfway through another American tour, replacing Mark Clarke who was exhausted and nearing a mental breakdown. \"Gary just had a style about him, it was incredible because every bass player in the world that I've ever known has always loved his style, with those melodic bass lines,\" Box later said. Thus the \"classic\" Uriah Heep formed and, according to biographer K. Blows, \"Everything just clicked into place.\""]}, {"page": "Jon Lord", "response": ["Following the break-up of Redd Bludd's Bluesicians in late 1963, Wood, Lord, and the drummer Red Dunnage put together a new band, The Art Wood Combo. This also included Derek Griffiths (guitar) and Malcolm Pool (bass guitar). Dunnage left in December 1964 to be replaced by Keef Hartley, who had previously replaced Ringo Starr in Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. This band, later known as \"The Artwoods\", focused on the organ as the bluesy, rhythmic core of their sound, in common with the contemporary bands The Spencer Davis Group (Steve Winwood on organ) and The Animals (with Alan Price). They made appearances on the BBC's Saturday Club radio show and on such TV programs as Ready Steady Go!. It also performed abroad, and it appeared on the first Ready Steady Goes Live, promoting its first single the Lead Belly song \"Sweet Mary\" \u2014 but significant commercial success eluded it. Its only charting single was \"I Take What I Want\", which reached number 28 on 8 May 1966."]}, {"page": "Mountain (band)", "response": ["After pursuing separate musical paths for almost a decade, West and Laing reunited Mountain, recruiting Miller Anderson (ex-Savoy Brown & Keef Hartley) on bass in 1981. After Anderson had Travel visa troubles, he was replaced in 1984 by Mark Clarke and the group recorded Go for Your Life (March 1985). This line up played at the Knebworth Fayre on June 22, 1985 alongside Alaska, Mama's Boys, Blackfoot, Meat Loaf, Scorpions and Deep Purple. Go For Your Life was dedicated to Pappalardi's memory. Shortly thereafter, the band performed with Triumph at the Prairie Capital Convention Center in Illinois."]}, {"page": "The Incredible String Band", "response": ["The band toured for much of 1969, in the US and the UK. In July they played at the Albert Hall on the fourth night of the \"Pop Proms\". They were introduced by John Peel and talked about their first brush with Scientology. Other acts in the week were Led Zeppelin and The Who. On 28 May 1969 the band received a phone call from Michael Lang, the producer of the momentous Woodstock Festival, asking the band to perform at the festival for a payment of $4,500. In August, they were slotted to play on Friday when all the folk-oriented and acoustic acts were expected to perform. However, the band refused to perform in the pouring rain, so stage manager John Morris rescheduled their performance for the following day. Their open slot was taken by Melanie, whose showing inspired her song, \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)\". The following day, 16 August 1969, at approximately 6:30\u00a0p.m., the band played in between the Keef Hartley Band and Canned Heat. The crowd was not anticipating the band's performance on a day that featured mainly hard rock acts. For that reason, the group was generally disfavoured and, perhaps more importantly, were not included in the filming of the festival. Over the Labor Day weekend in 1969, they appeared at the Texas International Pop Festival, in Lewisville, Texas. In November, they released the album Changing Horses, which was generally seen as a disappointment after their earlier work. By late 1969, they had established a communal base at Glen Row near Innerleithen. In April 1970 they released the album I Looked Up."]}, {"page": "Bill Ward (musician)", "response": ["Bill started to play drums as a child, listening to the big bands of the 1940s; his early major influences were Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson. Later he was influenced by drummers such as Larrie Londin, Bernard Purdie, Joe Morello, Keef Hartley, Hughie Flint, John Bonham, Ringo Starr, Jim Capaldi and Clive Bunker. In the mid-1960s Ward sang and played drums in a band called the Rest, before he and guitarist Tony Iommi played together in a band called Mythology, and upon that band's dissolution joined vocalist Ozzy Osbourne and bassist Geezer Butler, who had previously played together in a band called Rare Breed. The new band called themselves Earth, but were soon renamed Black Sabbath."]}, {"page": "Something (Beatles song)", "response": ["In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME lauded the track as \"a real quality hunk of pop\" with a \"strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality\". Johnson stated his regret that Harrison \"isn't featured more regularly as a singer\", and concluded of \"Something\": \"It's a song that grows on you, and mark my words, it will \u2013 in a big way!\" As guest singles reviewer for Melody Maker, Keef Hartley said it was \"probably the best track\" on Abbey Road, adding: \"What I was waiting for was that guitar solo because George Harrison is just about the only guitar player I know of who can plan a solo so it doesn't sound as though it is planned.\""]}]}}
