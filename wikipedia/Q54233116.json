It is kept inside an environment that allows controlled air-drying. Schofield continuously monitors the amount of sulphur and iron in the warship, working with Serena Corr at the University of Glasgow. Sulphur is present on the seabed, and became incorporated into the hull of the warship whilst it was underwater. Anaerobic bacteria react with sulphur in seawater, which can then produced iron sulfides by combining with iron corroded from fixtures and artefacts. She also works with Rachel O'Reilly at the University of Birmingham as part of a Leverhulme Trust grant that looks to develop polymers that can remove iron ions from the wood, which could prevent these damaging acids from forming. To do this, Corr, O'Reilly and Schofield use core magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles that are embedded them into a thermoresponsive polymer. The treatment can be applied as a liquid, directed to particular areas of the wood using external magnetic fields. They can then be set as a gel and peeled from the surface. She studied twelve of Henry VIII of England's iron cannonballs using synchrotron X\u2010ray powder diffraction."]}]}}
