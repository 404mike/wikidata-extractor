He created the Skybirds range of 1:72 scale model aircraft kits produced by A. J. Holladay & Co., the same scale later being adopted by Airfix. Between 1938-1939 he contributed articles and illustrations to Air Stories magazine, and between 1959\u20131967, he contributed articles to the newspaper The Times.In 1933 he attended the College of Aeronautical Engineering in Chelsea, earning a first-class diploma for practice and theory.He lived in Borehamwood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Airfix", "response": ["In 1954 Woolworth's buyer Jim Russon suggested that Airfix produce a model kit of Sir Francis Drake's Golden Hind, then being sold in North America as a 'ship-in-a-bottle', made in the more stable polystyrene. To meet Woolworth's retail price of two shillings, Airfix packaged the product in a plastic bag with a paper header that had the assembly instructions on the reverse. Its huge success led the company to produce new kit designs. The first aircraft kit was released in 1955, a model of the Supermarine Spitfire Mk I, followed by the Spitfire Mk IX in 1955, in  scale, developed by James Hay Stevens.Arthur Ward, The Boys' Book of Airfix: Who Says You Ever Have to Grow Up?, Random House, 2009, , , (page 49) This was a scaled-down copy of the Aurora  Supermarine Spitfire kit.
