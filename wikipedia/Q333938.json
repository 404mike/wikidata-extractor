In 1871, the City brought a suit against 16 of the lords of the forest manors, claiming that the enclosures impinged on their ancient grazing rights.Haggar 2012, p. 90 Following an appeal in 1874, a judgment by the Master of the Rolls, Sir George Jessel, ruled that all enclosures made since 1851 were illegal.Walford 1898, p. 429 Subsequently, two acts of Parliament in 1871 and 1872 allowed the City to purchase the 19 forest manors.Haggar 2012, p. 91"]}, {"page": "Joseph William Chitty", "response": ["Chitty entered Lincoln's Inn in 1851, was called to the bar in 1856, and made a Queen's Counsel in 1874, electing to practise as such in the court of Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls.

Sir Joseph Chitty was for sixteen years a popular judge, in the best meaning of the phrase, being noted for his courtesy, geniality, patience and scrupulous fairness, as well as for his legal attainments, and being much respected and liked by those practising before him, in spite of a habit of interrupting counsel, possibly acquired through the example of Sir George Jessel."]}, {"page": "George Jessel", "response": ["George Jessel may refer to:", "*George Jessel (actor) (1898\u20131981), American actor", "*George Jessel (jurist) (1824\u20131883), English jurist", "*George Jessel of the Jessel Baronets"]}, {"page": "Solicitor General for England and Wales", "response": ["*Sir George Jessel 1871\u20131873"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1837\u20131901)", "response": ["*Sir George Jessel (1824\u20131883)"]}, {"page": "James Paget", "response": ["Besides shorter writings, he also published Clinical Lectures and Essays (1st ed. 1875) and Studies of Old Case-books (1891).

But from the time of the Conservative reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of Benjamin Disraeli may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under Secretary of State in one of Lord Salisbury's ministries, while Sir Julian Goldsmid, a Liberal Unionist after the Home Rule policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons."]}, {"page": "William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher", "response": ["On the reconstitution of the Court of Appeal in 1876, Brett was elevated to the rank of a Lord Justice of Appeal.

In 1885 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Esher, of Esher in the County of Surrey. He opposed the bill proposing that an accused person or his wife might give evidence in their own case and supported the bill that empowered Lords of Appeal to sit and vote after their retirement. The Solicitors Act 1888, which increased the powers of the Incorporated Law Society, owed much to his influence. In 1880, he delivered a speech in the House of Lords, deprecating the delay and expense of trials, which he regarded as having been increased by the Judicature Act 1873.
