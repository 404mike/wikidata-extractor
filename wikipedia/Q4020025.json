He wrote a considerable number of novels, biographies, histories, essays (especially about the dangers of alcohol and the plight of the poor) and popular fantasy stories, mostly in the 1860s and 1870s. Some of these have been reprinted in recent decades and are still available today.  He is best remembered, however, as the father of dramatist W. S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan.", "link_mentions": {}}}
