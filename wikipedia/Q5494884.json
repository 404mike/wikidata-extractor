Later that season he made his County Championship bow against Leicestershire, playing three Championship games in total, all in July. However, he left the county for Worcestershire at the end of the season.\n1947 saw Cooper score 380 runs in his 26 innings at an average of 18.09. The following summer he had his best season in county cricket, hitting 618 runs at 22.88 including his only first-class century: 113 not out in the second innings against Nottinghamshire; his brother and teammate Edwin had made exactly 100 in the first innings of the same match.\n\n1948 also saw Cooper selected for West of England against East of England, the last such first-class match. He made 53 and 16, but the West were beaten by 223 runs.\nIn the 1949 and 1950 seasons, Cooper played only intermittently for the Worcestershire first team, spending a considerable amount of time turning out for the Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship. He made one first-class half-century in each season, but he was dismissed for single-figure scores in 13 of his 20 innings, and after the 1950 season his time in first-class cricket came to an end.\nCooper was born in Bacup, Lancashire; he died in Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire at the age of 65.\nHis brother Edwin had a much longer career with Worcestershire, playing 249 times for the county.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Following the emigration of Sandy Singleton to Rhodesia after the 1946 season, Allan White succeeded him as Worcestershire captain. The team lacked batting strength and did well to improve their championship position. The outstanding player was Test all-rounder Dick Howorth who was, as in 1946, the first player to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with Peter Jackson who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player Roly Jenkins made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman Reg Perks took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper Hugo Yarnold who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, Eddie Cooper and, in his first full season, Don Kenyon all exceeded 1,000 runs. Worcestershire's best known batsmen at the time were Charles Palmer and the veteran Bob Wyatt and they were the first two in the county averages but neither played a full season. Laddie Outschoorn qualified for the championship for the first time and showed promise. Other players included Ronald Bird, Fred Cooper (brother of Eddie), Norman Whiting and Martin Young.Playfair, pp. 94\u201395."]}, {"page": "Fred Cooper (1921-1986)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1921)"]}, {"page": "Fred Cooper (Lancashire cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1921)"]}, {"page": "Fred Cooper (Worcestershire cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1921)"]}, {"page": "West of England cricket team", "response": ["* Fred Cooper (1948)"]}, {"page": "Fred Cooper (1921\u20131986)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1921)"]}, {"page": "Frederick Cooper", "response": ["Frederick or Fred Cooper may refer to:", "* Fred Cooper (bicyclist) (1852\u20131935), professional racing cyclist and bicycle manufacturer", "* Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1888) (1888\u20131958), Essex cricketer", "* Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1921) (1921\u20131986), Lancashire and Worcestershire cricketer", "* Fred Cooper (footballer) (1934\u20131972), professional footballer for West Ham United in the 1950s", "* Fred Cooper (illustrator), Society of Illustrators's Hall of Fame", "* Fred Cooper (boat designer), powerboat designer, early of the British Power Boat Company", "* Fred Cooper (rugby union), Welsh rugby union footballer of the 1890s for Yorkshire, Newport Athletic RFC, and Bradford FC"]}]}}
