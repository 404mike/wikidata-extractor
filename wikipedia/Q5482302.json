He competed at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and won a gold medal in the 18 ft. Dinghy class with Thomas Hedberg. Sailing the boat Brat, Richards and Hedberg were the only entrants in their class. It is uncertain if this crew was actually awarded the gold medals - they were not able to finish the first competition and they did not start in any other; they do not appear in the Official Report of the Antwerp Games. However they are listed on the website of the ISAF as well as that of the IOC as Gold Medalists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walkover", "response": ["In the 1920 Summer Olympics sailing program, there were a total of sixteen different yacht classes \u2013 no other Olympic games sailed more than seven classes until the 1980s \u2013 spreading the competitors so thinly that there were six gold medals won by walkover, each of those yachts completing its course unopposed to claim gold. A seventh yacht, Francis Richards' entrant in the 18' dinghy, also attempted a walkover but did not finish the course; this crew is officially recognised as gold medallists by the International Olympic Committee, but was not mentioned in the most official contemporary report by games organisers, casting doubt over whether or not the crew actually received gold medals at the time due to not finishing the course. There were also two of the sixteen classes with no entrants at all."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1920 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Thomas Hedberg  Francis Richards"]}, {"page": "Sailing at the 1920 Summer Olympics", "response": ["  |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|22x20px|border|alt=|link=|Great Britain\u00a0Great Britain\u00a0(GBR)Francis RichardsThomas Hedberg"]}, {"page": "Richards (surname)", "response": ["*Francis Richards (1873\u20131955), British Olympic sailor", "*Francis Richards (born 1945), former governor of Gibraltar"]}, {"page": "Thomas Hedberg", "response": ["Thomas Hedberg was a British sailor and Olympic Champion.
