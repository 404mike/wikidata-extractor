The verse of Marmion is less striking than that of The Lay, with the epistles in iambic tetrameters and the narrative in tetrameters with frequent trimeters. The reception by the reviewers was less favourable than that accorded The Lay: style and plot were both found faulty, the epistles did not link up with the narrative, there was too much antiquarian pedantry, and Marmion's character was immoral.J.

Another was Ludwig Uhland, a figure in the German Romantic movement.  He retold the Vita\u2019s story in his ballad Merlin der Wilde (1829),  portraying Merlin as deriving his power from the forest and the forces of nature.  Laurence Binyon's The Madness of Merlin (1947) is another posthumously published fragment, based primarily on the Vita but also on the Myrddin and Lailoken traditions, and with new characters of Binyon's own invention.  He described this work as a \"dialogue arranged as story rather than drama\".  Mary Stewart's novel The Last Enchantment (1979), the last of a trilogy narrated by Merlin, took material from many sources; the Vita Merlini contributed to it Merlin's delirious retreat to the forest and the incident of the doomed boy whose shoes need patching.  The New Age writer John Matthews has retold the Vita as \"The Life of Merlin\".  Finally, the American academic Jerry Hunter's Welsh-language novel Gwenddydd (2010) takes the story of Gwenddydd and Myrddin from the earliest Welsh poems and the Vita Merlini, and transposes it to the Second World War, Myrddin becoming a soldier suffering from PTSD who escapes from a military hospital and reunites with his sister Gwen in the family's home village.
