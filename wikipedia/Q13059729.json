Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid filed objection to the charging orders claiming absolute beneficial interest on one of the two property, and 74% beneficial interest in the other. Despite the objection, Erlam was able to obtain a final charging order on the second property on 29 June 2015. Additionally, an interim charging order was then secured against a property registered solely in Farid's name on the argument that Rahman has a beneficial interest in it.", "Due to Lutfur Rahman's failure to pay court cost as ordered, and Ayesha Farid's claims of beneficial interest in their properties, Andy Erlam applied for Rahman's asset to be frozen to prevent dissipation in case Farid's claim is upheld. Knowles J granted Erlam an interim freezing and disclosure order on 29 June 2015, which was extended by Edis J to cover assets worldwide. The disclosure order required Rahman to reveal his worldwide assets, details his income and expenditure for the previous five years, and to produce seven years worth of personal tax returns.", "A hearing into Ayesha Farid's claim originally set for 30 September 2015 was rescheduled to 1\u20133 December. Less than 2 weeks before the December hearings, Lutfur Rahman was declared bankrupt on his own petition. As a result, proceedings in respect to the two properties without a final charging order was stayed pursuant to section 285 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Determination on Farid's claim of 74% beneficial interest on the remaining property continued at the court's discretion. The property was purchased in 2005 with a mortgage in Rahman's name, and all rental payments income and mortgage payments outgoing were handled by Rahman. As part of her evidence, Farid produced a declaration of trust dated May 2006 in support of her claim.", "On 29 January 2016, chief master Matthew Marsh ruled against Ayesha Farid granting a declaration that Lutfur Rahman holds an absolute beneficial interest in the property under question. In his ruling, Marsh accused Lutfur Rahman, who was not called as a witness by Ayesha Farid of knowingly providing misleading information when making his mortgage application, and failure to declare rental income received to HM Revenue and Customs. Farid was labelled by Marsh as \"a thoroughly unsatisfactory and unreliable witness\" with a \"cavalier attitude to disclosure\" who was \"willing to alter and extend her case when challenged\". In addition to finding that Farid had failed with her evidence to establish a trust on the balance of probabilities, the declaration of trust of May 2006 was also held to be a sham, \"prepared in order to be available, if needed\" rather than to reflect the true position.", "An application for permission to bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in July 2015, with a hearing held on 26 January 2016. The application was made in the hopes of reducing Rahman incapacity from holding elective office from five years to three years. While maintaining that many of the election court findings are wrong, the application acknowledged that challenges may only be made on those conclusions which amount to error of law. The court findings that canvassers were paid in contravention of section 111 of the 1983 Act, and that Rahman is guilty of bribery personally and by his agent in contravention of section 113 were challenged on the basis that they were reached without any sufficient evidence such that it amounts to an error of law, and that the commissioner erred when interpreting the provision on bribery. A challenge was made to the finding of undue spiritual influence on the basis that the Commissioner conclusion was in contravention to authority, and incompatible with Article 9 or Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or both. The divisional court of Lloyd LJ and Supperstone J granted Rahman permission to launch a judicial review on the undue spiritual influence finding because the law had not been tested for over a century, but rejected the other two challenges, as a result leaving in place Rahman's five years ban from elective office even if he is successful in a judicial review. The judicial review application was closed following the non-payment of court fee.", "A renewed application for permission to bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in August 2016, after the Metropolitan Police concluded in March 2016 there was insufficient evidence to bring a criminal prosecution. As part of the renewed application, permission to reopen the original judicial review application was sought and granted by Ouseley J. The August 2016 application took the form of an application for permission to amend the grounds of the July 2015 judicial review claim. Three additional grounds for review were sought by Rahman. The first two grounds rely on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights arguing that the election court findings are incompatible with the presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial, given the subsequent decision of the Metropolitan Police. Permission for those two grounds were rejected by the divisional court with the findings that Rahman was at no point charged with a criminal offence for the purpose of Article 6, and that there were no parallel criminal proceedings alongside civil proceedings of the election court. Permission to include the second ground was additionally denied on the basis of undue delay in raising the issue by Rahman. Under the third ground, Rahman sought a declaratory judgment that the Metropolitan Police decision to discontinue criminal investigation into him constituted an acquittal, and thus triggering the power of a court to order the cessation of the incapacity previously imposed by the election court judgment. Permission was denied based on the earlier finding that Rahman had not been charged, and thus impossible to have been acquitted on a prosecution.", "Lutfur Rahman was charged by the Solicitors Regulation Authority before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal in February 2016 of failure to uphold the rule of law and the proper administration of justice, act with integrity, or behave in a way that maintains the trust the public places in him and in the provision of legal services. The hearing into the charges was scheduled to take place between 7\u201310 March 2017 but was adjourned pending the determination of Rahman's second application for permission to bring a judicial review of the election court decision. The rearranged hearing started on Monday 18 December 2017 after the tribunal panel rejected an application for adjournment by Rahman filed the previous Friday on the grounds that he could not finance a representative nor feel able to self represent given his inexperience in disciplinary matters. On 20 December 2017, all charges against Rahman were found proven and he was struck off the roll of solicitors along with a costs order of \u00a386,400.", "Attempts was made from the end of 2016 by Lutfur Rahman and his associates including his former deputy Ohid Ahmad to form a new political party named Tower Hamlets Together. Following media reporting of the attempted party formation, Parliamentary Secretary (Minister for the Constitution) Chris Skidmore wrote to the Electoral Commission requesting Tower Hamlets Together's application for registration as a political party to be subject to a \"forensic review\". On 23 February 2017, the Electoral Commission rejected the application for registration with the reason that the proposed party name would \"likely to mislead voters as to the effect of their vote\", as the name is the same as that of a partnership of local health and social care organisations. A second attempt to form a new political party in January 2018 with the name of Aspire was successful. Members of this new party on the council consisted of the 9 remaining members of the Independent Group plus Mohammed Mufti Miah who had left the group and sat as an independent for a time. People's Alliance of Tower Hamlets was itself registered as a political party in February 2018, with members on the council consisted of the 5 members who sat together before the party's registration and Abjol Miah who sat as an independent after leaving the Independent Group.", "In response to the Metropolitan Police decision not to bring charges against Lutfur Rahman, Chair of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee Steve O'Connell made a formal request to Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Sophie Linden for an investigation by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary on the Metropolitan Police activities surrounding the 2014 mayoral election, a request Linden granted.
