In July 2010, Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg said that \"Assange has shown much better judgment with respect to what he has revealed than the people who kept those items secret inside the government.\" In October 2010, Ellsberg flew to London to give Assange his support. In November 2010, an individual from the office of Dmitry Medvedev, the President of Russia, suggested that Assange should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In December 2010, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, then President of Brazil, said \"They have arrested him and I don't hear so much as a single protest for freedom of expression\". Vladimir Putin, the prime minister of Russia, asked at a press conference \"Why is Mr Assange in prison? Is this democracy?\" In the same month, Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of Australia, described his activities as \"illegal\", but the Australian Federal Police said he had not broken Australian law. Joe Biden, the vice president of the United States, was asked whether he saw Assange as closer to a high-tech terrorist than to whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. Biden responded that he \"would argue it is closer to being a high-tech terrorist than the Pentagon Papers\". In November 2011, Vaughan Smith, founder of the Frontline Club, supported Assange and in July 2012 offered his residence in Norfolk for Assange to continue WikiLeaks' operations whilst in the UK. In April 2012, interviewed on Assange's television show World Tomorrow, Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa praised WikiLeaks and told his host \"Cheer up! Cheer up! Welcome to the club of the persecuted!\" In August 2012, historian and journalist Tariq Ali and former ambassador and author Craig Murray spoke in support of Assange outside the Ecuadorian embassy. In April 2013, filmmaker Oliver Stone stated that \"Julian Assange did much for free speech and is now being victimised by the abusers of that concept.\" In November 2014, Spanish Podemos party leader Pablo Iglesias also gave his support to Assange. In July 2015, British Member of Parliament Jeremy Corbyn opposed Assange's extradition to the US, and as Labour Party leader in April 2019 said the British government should oppose Assange's extradition to the US \"for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\"."]}, {"page": "David Loyn", "response": ["In 1998 (with Vaughan Smith), he secured exclusive access to the Kosovo Liberation Army to report from behind their lines in a series of reports that won the Foreign News Award from the Royal Television Society, the first of two awards won by Loyn that year; he was also made the RTS Journalist of the Year."]}, {"page": "Ellingham Hall, Norfolk", "response": ["Ellingham Hall is currently owned by Vaughan Smith, former British Army officer, journalist and founder of the Frontline Club in London.
