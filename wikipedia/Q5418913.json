In Scriven Bros & Co v Hindley & Co[1913] 3 KB 564 Scriven Bros made a bid at an auction (the auctioneer was trading as Hindley & Co) for bales of hemp and tow. The auction catalogue suggested that one of the batches contained both hemp and tow. But it only contained tow. When the auctioneer tried to enforce the high bid by Scriven Bros, Lawrence J held he could not, because the sale had been procured by the auctioneer's own negligence. Guenter Treitel has argued that the case is best explained on the basis that the court will have regard to the subjective intentions of the parties - that in fact hemp and tow was being contracted for. But Ewan McKendrick argues that this case is still explicable through taking an objective approach to the parties expressed wishes: a reasonable person in Hindley's position would not have thought there was a contract with someone misled by their negligently prepared auction catalogue.McKendrick (2007) 25"]}, {"page": "E McKendrick", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ewan McKendrick"]}, {"page": "Registrar of the University of Oxford", "response": [", there are 16 administrative sections for the university, and the heads of 12 of these report to the Registrar.

The Registrar is also the \"principal adviser on strategic policy\" to the university's Vice-Chancellor and Council (its main decision-making body). Other duties include oversight of \"the University's external relations\", responsibility for \"communications which express the general policy of the University\", and control of the university's records and publications. Before 1997, when amendments were made to set out the modern duties of the post, the statutes relating to the Registrar were predominantly an outdated list of record-keeping duties; a requirement for the Registrar to live in an official residence provided by the university was deleted at this time.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, with that amount of litigation, the various aspects of the law of restitution got significant further consideration from judges, practitioners and academics alike.
