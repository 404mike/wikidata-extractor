Moffat's pen names included Richard Allen, Etienne Aubin (The Terror of the Seven Crypts) and Trudi Maxwell (Diary of A Female Wrestler). Moffat's pulp novels mostly focused on youth subcultures of the late 1960s and 1970s, such as skinheads, hippies and bikers. In particular Moffat wrote a series of popular and commercially successful books featuring what came to be known as his most famous protagonist, the skinhead antihero Joe Hawkins. Moffat often expressed admiration for his subject matter and commented on social issues, mostly from a right wing perspective.\nThe collected works of Richard Allen were reissued in a six volume set by ST Publishing in the 1990s. A BBC TV documentary about his life, Skinhead Farewell, aired in 1996. Allen's formulaic and sensationalist writing style has been imitated by Neoist writer Stewart Home. Mark Sargeant wrote a feature in Scootering Magazine titled The Richard Allen Legacy. An interview titled The Return of Joe Hawkins with publisher George Marshall was in issue seven of Skinhead Times (1992).\nUnder his own name Moffat wrote at least two science fiction novels: The Sleeping Bomb (New English Library, 1970; US edition 1973, The Cambri Plot) and a Queen Kong (1977) a movie tie-in to the low-budget 1976 movie of that name.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Allen", "response": ["*James Moffat (author) (1922\u20131993), Canadian-British novelist, wrote as Richard Allen, among other pseudonyms"]}, {"page": "Richard Allen (author)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Moffat (author)"]}, {"page": "Richard Allen (pen name)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Moffat (author)"]}, {"page": "Etienne Aubin", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Moffat (author)"]}, {"page": "Trudi Maxwell", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Moffat (author)"]}, {"page": "James Moffat", "response": ["James Moffat or Moffatt may refer to:", "*James Moffat (author) (1922\u20131993), author who wrote under several pen names", "*James Moffat (mathematician) (born 1948), professor of physics, University of Aberdeen", "*James Moffat (engraver), Scottish engraver", "*James Moffat (racing driver) (born 1984), Australian racing driver", "*James Moffatt (1870\u20131944), Scottish theologian", "*James Moffatt (rugby), Scottish rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s and 1900s"]}, {"page": "Richard Allen, pen name", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Moffat (author)"]}]}}
