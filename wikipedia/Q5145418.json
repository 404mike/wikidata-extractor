He played four matches for Somerset in the 1952 season, when the side finished bottom of the County Championship for the first of four consecutive seasons, and then turned out for them regularly in the 1953 season, when the side was perhaps even weaker. He had one highly successful match \u2013 though, true to form, Somerset lost the game. Against Worcestershire at Frome, he took six of the eight wickets to fall in the first innings at a personal cost of 62 runs, and then five of the seven that fell in the second innings, to finish with match figures of 11 for 177. In between these two bowling performances, he made an unbeaten 26, batting at No 11 in Somerset's second innings, so his two best bowling returns and his highest first-class score all came in the same game.After the 1953 season, he made only two further first-class appearances, both in August 1954, without success.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Mitchell", "response": ["Mitchell's father (also called Colin) came from an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the MacBrayne ferry company before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War I. Mitchell (Snr) achieved the rank of captain (commissioned 'in the field') and was awarded the Military Cross at the Second Battle of Ypres, but when the young Colin asked him how he would only say, 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, he worked in the City of London and married a Glaswegian woman (n\u00e9e Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the LMS Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of Purley where they had two children \u2013 Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest semi-detached house and Colin would attend services at the local Presbyterian Church wearing a kilt.The Independent, obituary, early paragraphs on family history in 'free to view' section :Lt-Col Colin Mitchell, by Tam Dalyell - 24 July 1996 Mitchell received his formal education at the Whitgift Grammar School in Croydon.", "In 1940, at age 15, Mitchell enlisted in the Home Guard, and may have been the youngest Home Guard soldier. In May 1943 he joined the British Army, enlisting as a private in the Royal West Kent Regiment. He soon became a Lance-Corporal and instructed newcomers in physical training. One of his fellow instructors was Stan Cullis who had been the captain of the Wolverhampton Wanderers cup side at Wembley in 1939 and was the captain of England at the time. Mitchell was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1944. He fought in the final battles of the Italian campaign, and was lightly wounded in the advance on Ferrara. Despite this, his wartime experience inclined him to take up a military career.The Independent, obituary :Lt-Col Colin Mitchell, by Tam Dalyell - 24 July 1996 He was appointed to a regular commission on 21 December 1946.", "Mitchell married Jean Hamilton (Sue) Phillips in April 1956.
