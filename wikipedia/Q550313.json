His 2008 win saw him join Phil Taylor, Eric Bristow, Raymond van Barneveld and John Lowe as the only players with three or more World Championships, and become only the second player (after Taylor) to win multiple PDC titles.", "By 1993, Part was Canada's highest ranked player and was competing in prestigious events sanctioned by the British Darts Organisation. A significant win soon came in the 1993 WDF World Cup, where he and Carl Mercer won the Pairs Championship for Canada. Nevertheless, when he qualified for the 1994 BDO World Championship, he was still a relative unknown. This was the first BDO World Championship since the acrimonious split in darts, and, as a result, the field included many newcomers and debutants, including Part himself. In the first round Part defeated second seed Ronnie Baxter in straight sets, and thereafter swept through to the final beating Paul Lim, Steve McCollum and Ronnie Sharp dropping only one set en route. He faced the charismatic  veteran Bobby George in the final and won 6\u20130 in sets.  Little over six years after receiving his first dartboard, Part had won a World Championship; he was the first non-British player to do so, and he is one of the few players to win the tournament on their debut. Part's achievement of dropping only one set in winning a World Championship is only matched by Eric Bristow from the 1984 BDO World Darts Championship, and later by Phil Taylor in the 2001 PDC World Darts Championship.", "The 2001 PDC World Darts Championship was to be a turning point in Part's career, even though he ultimately suffered a crushing defeat in the final. Part comfortably advanced through the tournament until the semi-final, where he defeated Essex veteran Rod Harrington 6\u20135 in a classic contest to reach his first major PDC final. There he would meet Phil Taylor, who had won the last six world championships and was considered as darts' greatest ever player. This was Part's first meeting with Taylor in an official PDC match, but it was not a happy one. Taylor, who had been in stunning form throughout the tournament, averaged 107.46 and had a 72% checkout rate in the final, now considered one of darts' most dominant ever showings; Part only won three legs in the entire match as Taylor stormed to a 7\u20130 win. Taylor's performance, described as 'ludicrous' by The Guardian, while simply regarded by darts commentator Sid Waddell as a 'vicious example of near perfection' and an 'annihilation', could have seriously affected Part's confidence. But it would only provide the Canadian with further motivation to challenge the best. Over the next two years, Part won a string of minor titles, rose to number two in the world rankings and developed a rivalry with Taylor that would define this stage of his career.", "But the disappointment was nothing compared to what would occur in the new year, as 2004 began with one of Part's most disastrous defeats of all. The Canadian entered the 2004 PDC World Championship as the reigning champion, but was unable to win even a single match in the defence of his title. In the first round he came up against debutant Mark Dudbridge but was stunned in a 4\u20133 defeat. Phil Taylor would go on to retake the World Championship crown with a 7\u20136 win over Kevin Painter in the final. In 2004, Part had much success in North America, where he again won the Canadian Open and Canadian National Championships, as well as winning the Golden Harvest North American Cup. Despite Taylor regaining the PDC World Championship, Part once again defeated 'The Power' in the 2004 UK Open quarter-final, with an 8\u20136 win. Part would then go on to reach his only major final of 2004 at the same event, but would once again fail to consolidate as he was soundly beaten 11\u20136 in the final by Roland Scholten. At the 2004 World Matchplay, Part began with a 10\u20130 whitewash of Colin Monk in the first round, and then had an epic win over Bob Anderson in the second round, where Part survived four match darts against him and eventually won in a tiebreak by 17\u201315. In his quarter final match against Andy Jenkins, Part struggled for much of the match and trailed 7\u201311, but Part fought his way back to eventually win 16\u201314, setting up a highly anticipated semi final match against Taylor, with Part having won 3 of his previous 4 matches against Taylor on Sky Sports. Despite Part's recent wins over Taylor on TV, Part started the semi final against Taylor very poorly, averaging in the low 80s and seeing Taylor cruise to an incredible 10\u20130 lead on a mid 90s average, as the 150/1 shot of a 17\u20130 whitewash looked a possibility. However, Part improved his game from the eleventh leg onwards, but losing the first 10 legs had left Part with far too much to do. Part restored plenty of respectability after his poor start, but Taylor won the match 17\u20138. After beating Part, Taylor went on to beat Mark Dudbridge 18\u20138 in the final, to win his fifth consecutive World Matchplay title and his seventh World Matchplay title in all.", "The year 2006 was seminal to both the Professional Darts Corporation, and Part's career. Concerning the former, it heralded the arrival of four-times BDO World Champion Raymond van Barneveld to the PDC. With van Barneveld's arrival and his immediate impact in the 2006 Premier League, Part was no longer perceived as Taylor's main rival (indeed, Part has not beaten Taylor in a televised match since his 2005 World Matchplay victory). Part's shaken status was not helped by a defeat in the third round of the 2006 PDC World Championship to Wayne Mardle. Despite these setbacks, Part's career experienced a somewhat fitful renewal in the three years that followed. In July, he won his first major title since the 2003 World Championship with victory in the 2006 Las Vegas Desert Classic. The Desert Classic had long been a fruitful tournament for Part; in its eight-year history he reached six semi-finals, but it was only in 2006 that he won the trophy. In 2003, he had lost out in the final to Peter Manley having beaten Phil Taylor in the semi-final; this time it was van Barneveld's turn to suffer the same fate. The Dutchman had beaten Taylor in the semi-final, and in a tense final initially matched Part 3\u20133. However, the Canadian won nine of the next eleven legs to secure a 6\u20133 victory and his second major title in the PDC.", "Part's other major results in 2006 were indifferent however, including Phil Taylor defeating Part 13\u20132 in the second round of the 2006 World Matchplay. The match was heavily hyped up beforehand with Part and Taylor having played many classic matches before and Part having beaten Taylor four times on television. However, their match at the 2006 World Matchplay was in complete contrast to their classic matches from the past, being a flat anti-climax throughout as Taylor played below average and Part played very poor throughout. Part also had another disappointing World Championship in 2007. This time he was eliminated tamely in the second round by Chris Mason. The defeat meant that Part had not reached the quarter-finals of the PDC World Championship since his epic world title victory in 2003, while van Barneveld went on to defeat Phil Taylor 7\u20136 in a similarly momentous final. But for the rest of 2007, Part returned to some of his best form. He reached three semi-finals of televised majors: US Open; the World Grand Prix, and the Las Vegas Desert Classic (though he could not defend his title in the latter). These consistent performances meant he entered the 2008 PDC World Championship as the 11th seed, though he was not considered one of the favourites for the event. Nevertheless, Part advanced steadily through the tournament, setting the tournament's highest average in the second round against Mensur Suljovi\u0107. He then came through a tight quarter-final against the 2007 PDC Player of the Year and third seed James Wade, winning in a deciding set 5\u20134. In the semi-final he faced Kevin Painter, reminiscent of his 2003 triumph; Part once again emerged victorious, 6\u20132 this time, and found himself in his fourth world championship final.", "In June 2010, Part came through a large field of players to win the PDC North American Darts Championship in Las Vegas. Part failed to get into the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts after Adrian Lewis surprisingly defeated Phil Taylor in the semi finals of the 2010 World Grand Prix.

Part stated \"he had nothing to lose\" and that illness had stopped him reaching where he wanted to be at the World Championships. Part's form continued when he won another players championship in May 2011 in Austria by thrashing Denis Ovens 6\u20130 in the final, having earlier overcoming Phil Taylor 6\u20132.
