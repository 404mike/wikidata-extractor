In 1921 a glider competition was held in the Rh\u00f6n mountains, and in mid-August 1922 another was held at the Wasserkuppe. The 1922 prize of 100,000 marks was won by a flight of 66 minutes, demonstrating the possibilities of engineless flight. In response, the Daily Mail offered a prize of \u00a31,000 to the pilot making the longest flight in England. The Royal Aero Club chose Itford Hill on the South Downs just east of Brighton as a venue and the event was arranged for 16\u201321 October 1922. This gave contestants just six weeks to design and build their gliders, or to bring them from Europe. Thirteen gliders competed with each other and the autumn weather. The best flight by an Englishman was that made by Fred Raynham in a Handasyde aircraft, lasting 113 minutes, but the Frenchman Alexis Maneyrol did better in his Peyret tandem monoplane, staying up for a world record 201 minutes to win the prize. Given this demonstration of long duration unpowered flight it is not surprising that people began to consider the possibilities of glider-like aircraft, fitted with small engines, as sports aircraft for the private flyer. The first Lympne meeting the following year and its slightly earlier counterpart in Vauville near Cherbourg, France, were the result both of these ideas and a desire to build an aircraft which would satisfy the needs of private fliers and foster private aviation. Unfortunately, in the opinion of many, both at the time and later, the restrictions imposed resulted in aircraft that had too-small engines, wheels that were too thin and of small diameter and engines which, though under powered, were too heavy relative to the often fragile, light-weight frames in which they were housed. C. G. Grey, editor of 'The Aeroplane' at the time devoted two issues to \"a four-page long diatribe\" to the failures of the 1924 event and the author of 'The Lympne Trials' speaks of \"a clear failure to understand what a private pilot or a flying club might need as a training aeroplane\". Nevertheless, the trials did serve to stimulate public and industry interest in private aviation after the first world war and certainly exercised the ingenuity of designers to the maximum in complying with the restrictions placed upon them.", "|Fred Raynham", "|Fred Raynham"]}, {"page": "A Romance of Mayfair", "response": ["* Fred Raynham - Sir Dugald MacLean "]}, {"page": "Boadicea (film)", "response": ["* Fred Raynham as Badwallon "]}, {"page": "The Hound of the Baskervilles (1921 film)", "response": ["* Fred Raynham as Barrymore, the Butler "]}, {"page": "The Flag Lieutenant (1926 film)", "response": ["* Fred Raynham as Major Thesiger "]}, {"page": "The Wandering Jew (1923 film)", "response": ["* Fred Raynham - Inquisitor "]}, {"page": "The Presumption of Stanley Hay, MP", "response": ["The Presumption of Stanley Hay, MP is a 1925 British silent drama film directed by Sinclair Hill and starring David Hawthorne, Betty Faire, Fred Raynham and Kinsey Peile.
