Edmunds purchased confectionery from a local shop and laced them with strychnine before returning them to be sold to unsuspecting members of the public. Her actions resulted in several people becoming seriously ill, and at least one death. Arrested and put on trial, Edmunds was initially sentenced to death. However, this was later commuted to life imprisonment. She spent the rest of her life at the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, dying there in 1907.", "link_mentions": {}}}
