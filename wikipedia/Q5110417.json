Edmunds purchased confectionery from a local shop and laced them with strychnine before returning them to be sold to unsuspecting members of the public. Her actions resulted in several people becoming seriously ill, and at least one death. Arrested and put on trial, Edmunds was initially sentenced to death. However, this was later commuted to life imprisonment. She spent the rest of her life at the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, dying there in 1907.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anna Massey", "response": ["|Christiana Edmunds"]}, {"page": "Broadmoor Hospital", "response": ["*Christiana Edmunds, the 'Chocolate Cream Poisoner'"]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Christiana Edmunds, \"The Chocolate Cream Poisoner\", while living in Brighton, poisoned several people (killing a four-year-old boy) with adulterated chocolate creams in the 1870s"]}, {"page": "1872 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* January \u2013 opening of trial of Christiana Edmunds, the Brighton \"Chocolate Cream Killer\", for poisoning, at which she is found guilty."]}, {"page": "Strychnine poisoning", "response": ["*Christiana Edmunds, the 'Chocolate Cream Poisoner', laced chocolates with strychnine.

Her uncle, wealthy Marcus Chesney, believes that eyewitnesses are unreliable.  He avers that to observe something, then to relate accurately what was just seen, is impossible.  In order to prove his statements, he sets up a test; three witnesses are invited to witness some staged events not only in their view but in that of a movie camera.  After the events, it is planned that they will answer a list of ten questions.  Marcus Chesney takes a principal role in the staged events and, during them, is fed a large green capsule containing poison by a masked and disguised figure wearing black spectacles.  Amazingly, the three witnesses cannot agree upon the answers to any of the questions and no one can identify the murderer.  It seems as though Chesney very carefully set up the ideal conditions for someone to murder him and escape, but Gideon Fell, upon viewing the movie footage, can answer all ten questions plus the eleventh\u2014who is the murderer?"]}, {"page": "John Southerden Burn", "response": ["Burn married firstly Sarah Sophia Colnett at St Lawrence Jewry on 17 April 1822.
