Though the main period of use as an oppidum seems to have been the 6th to 4th centuries BC, there is some evidence that it was indeed stormed by the Romans, probably in the Invasion of Britain by Claudius. It may have been taken by the Legio II Augusta under Vespasian in their push westwards in AD 44. It is possible the site was settled as far back as the Bronze Age, but it and the surrounding barrows were deliberately destroyed by John Erle-Drax in 1875."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Wareham||John Erle-Drax||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Wareham (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"|John Erle-Drax", "| John Erle-Drax", "| John Erle-Drax"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1874 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Erle-Drax"]}, {"page": "John Samuel Wanley Sawbridge-Ernle-Erle-Drax", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Erle-Drax"]}, {"page": "John Samuel Wanley Sawbridge-Erle-Drax", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Erle-Drax "]}, {"page": "Richard Drax", "response": ["During the 2010 United Kingdom general election campaign period, in which Drax was campaigning to be MP for South Dorset, the Daily Mirror reported that Drax's family had earned their fortune through slavery.
