He began his career with the semi-autobiographical series Lowlife and a number of serials in the Dark Horse Presents anthology, before achieving industry-wide acclaim with the Vertigo series Scene of the Crime and moving to the superhero comics such as Batman, Catwoman, The Authority, Captain America, Daredevil and Uncanny X-Men. Brubaker is best known for his long-standing collaboration with British artist Sean Phillips, starting with their Elseworlds one-shot Batman: Gotham Noir in 2001 and continuing with a number of creator-owned series such as Criminal, Incognito, Fatale, The Fade Out and Kill or Be Killed. Brubaker has won an Eisner Award on seven separate occasions.", "Brubaker's last work for Dark Horse Presents was \"The Fall\", a five-part story illustrated by Berlin creator Jason Lutes about a convenience store clerk who gets involved in a ten-year-old murder mystery after he uses a stolen credit card. In 2001, all five parts were collected into a one-shot by Canadian publisher Drawn & Quarterly. In 2004, IDW Publishing announced the first creator-owned project by Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips, a pirate-themed series titled Black Sails. The creators eventually decided to shelve the series in favor of Criminal (published under Marvel's Icon imprint), and \"The Fall\" remained Brubaker's last independent comics work until his move to Image in 2012.", "In 1995, Brubaker was contacted by DC Comics to write a story about Prez for its \"mature readers\" imprint Vertigo, after being recommended to the editors by his \"An Accidental Death\" collaborator Eric Shanower (who was already attached to the project as the artist).Scene of the Crime 2012 (afterword). Image Comics The result\u2014Brubaker's first work for one of the two major American comic book publishers\u2014was a one-shot titled Vertigo Visions: Prez, a broad political satire revamping the obscure 1970s Joe Simon creation. Brubaker continued to pitch various ideas to Vertigo but kept getting rejected until Shelly Roeberg asked him to pitch \"something [he] didn't think Vertigo would publish\", which ended up being Scene of the Crime. The 1999 series marked Brubaker's first collaboration with two artists who would frequently work with him in later years: Michael Lark and Sean Phillips (who joined the project as the inker for issues #2\u20134). A slacker detective story set in San Francisco, Scene of the Crime was critically acclaimed and brought Brubaker to the attention of Hollywood producers for the first time.", "In 2002, Brubaker did his first work for Wildstorm, another DC imprint, penning the five-issue Wildcats spin-off Point Blank. The series, drawn by New Zealand artist Colin Wilson and starring Wildcats' member Grifter, took existing characters and concepts from the Wildstorm Universe and used them to set up Brubaker's Sleeper series which debuted later that year. A collaboration with artist Sean Phillips, Sleeper starred Holden Carver, a secret agent who goes undercover in a supervillain's powerful organization only to have his only contact in law enforcement fall into a coma. With the authorities believing him a dangerous criminal, Carver is caught between the two warring sides with unclear allegiances. Although Sleeper was a success with critics and fans on the Internet, the series underperformed commercially. In December 2003, in a unique publicity stunt conceived to help promote the first trade paperback collection of Sleeper, Brubaker organized an arm wrestling competition at San Francisco's Isotope Comics. If participants were able to beat Brubaker at arm wrestling, they were awarded free signed comic books. According to Brubaker, he wrestled around 40\u201350 people and won most of the time, losing only to eight or nine contestants.", "Also in 2006, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips launched their first creator-owned series Criminal, published under Marvel's Icon imprint. The title received generally positive reviews and its first arc, \"Coward\", won the 2007 Eisner Award for Best New Series. In 2008, after two volumes of Criminal, Brubaker and Phillips took a break from the series to launch another Icon title, Incognito, which Brubaker described as being \"about a completely amoral guy with super-powers forced to pretend he's a normal law-abiding citizen, because he's in Witness Protection, and how that shapes what he becomes. It's also a brutal noir twist on the super-hero/super-villain genre that delves more into their roots in the pulps, and it's going to be pretty over-the-top and action-packed.\"", "In January 2012, Brubaker and Phillips launched Fatale at Image. The series was initially announced as a twelve-issue maxi-series but was upgraded to an ongoing title in November 2012. Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated that \"You can't go wrong with a Brubaker/Phillips collaboration. Even so, Fatale is making a strong case for being the best of their projects.\" In October 2013, Brubaker signed a five-year contract to produce comics exclusively for Image. Under the terms of the deal, Image would publish any comic Brubaker brought to them without having to pitch it. Brubaker stated this arrangement was something he has always wanted.
