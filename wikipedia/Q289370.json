Another subspecies, L. h. aruensis, was described by Norwegian entomologist Embrik Strand in 1911. Subspecies indica (of L. scelio) had been described by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1897, but its origin is unclear. Frederick Octavius Pickard-Cambridge questioned Dahl's separating species on what he considered minor anatomical details but Dahl dismissed Pickard-Cambridge as an \"ignoramus\". Pickard-Cambridge was unsure whether L. hasselti warranted species status, though he confirmed scelio and hasselti as a single species, other researchers such as Ludwig Carl Christian Koch noting the differences to be inconsistent. The redback was also considered by some to be conspecific with the katip\u014d (L. katipo), which is native to New Zealand, though Koch regarded them as distinct."]}, {"page": "Octavius Pickard-Cambridge", "response": ["Pickard-Cambridge married Rose Wallace in 1866, and they had six sons.
