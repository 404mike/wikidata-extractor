In his first season with Sunderland he helped them win the league for the first time since the 1894\u201395 season and the last time until the 1935\u201336 season. He also played in the 1913 FA Cup Final against Aston Villa, with Sunderland losing 1\u20130.In the 1914\u201315 season, while playing for Ayr United, Richardson was joint top goalscorer in the Scottish league, with a total of 29 goals. In 1916, Richardson went to fight in France during the Great War. He returned in 1918 with stomach troubles, but was well enough to join the first team again on 2 November 1918, scoring a hat-trick against Hibernian in a match that ended 5\u20130.\nAfter retiring as a player Richardson became a manager for several clubs including Ayr United and Cowdenbeath. To this day, the 1924\u201325 season that Cowdenbeath played with Richardson as manager is still considered their greatest ever performance. For reasons unknown, despite having an incredible season, Richardson left the club after just one year as manager.\nAfter retiring from management, Richardson remained a fan of Ayr United and was spotted at the club as a supporter just a few months prior to his death in August 1951. He remains Ayr United's third highest goalscorer, despite having missed two seasons due to active service. On 4 January 1921, Ayr United held a testimonial match at Somerset Park for Richardson, known amongst fans as \"Jimmy's Day\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Richardson", "response": ["James Richardson may refer to:", "*James Richardson (Liberal politician) (1846\u20131921), Liberal Member of Parliament for Armagh", "*James Richardson (political consultant) (born 1984), Republican political strategist", "*James Richardson (darts player) (born 1974), English darts player", "*James Richardson (footballer) (1885\u20131951), Scottish footballer for Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday, and Ayr United", "*James Richardson Spensley (1867\u20131915), English doctor, footballer and manager, considered to be the father of football in Italy", "*James Richardson (cricketer) (1903\u20131995), English cricketer", "*James Richardson (Cisco), Canadian businessman with Cisco Systems", "*James Richardson (explorer) (1809\u20131851), British explorer of the Sahara", "*James Richardson (poet) (born 1950), American poet", "*James Richardson, owner of Spadina Hotel, Toronto", "*James Richardson (presenter) (born 1966), British television presenter associated with Italian football", "*James Richardson (1819\u20131892), Canadian businessman", "*James Richardson Corporation, Australian corporation involved with furniture, hospitality, real estate, and the duty-free retail businesses"]}, {"page": "Cowdenbeath F.C.", "response": ["* James Richardson (1924\u20131925)"]}, {"page": "1918\u201319 in Scottish football", "response": ["*19 April 1919, Ireland 0\u20130 Scotland.
