He is the chief rock & pop critic for The Times newspaper and contributes to Mojo magazine. He has written for The Guardian, The Independent and Vogue. Hodgkinson presents the Sky Arts TV show Songbook, in which he interviews contemporary songwriters.\nHis 2014 memoir The House Is Full Of Yogis tells the story of Hodgkinson's father joining an Indian spiritual group called the Brahma Kumaris and embracing celibacy, meditation and a radical, non-evolutionary world view, while his mother became a radical feminist and published \"Sex Is Not Compulsory\", her case for the sexless marriage, just as Hodgkinson was trying to meet girls for the first time. His book The Ballad Of Britain (2009) (Portico) is a travelogue for which he travelled through Britain making field recordings in an attempt to capture the spirit of the place and its people. Guitar Man (2006) and Song Man (2007) (Bloomsbury) are narrative non-fiction in a comic style. In Guitar Man, Hodgkinson picked up the guitar for the first time aged 34 with the aim of playing a concert six months later. He received lessons and advice from the Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch, Johnny Marr, former guitarist of The Smiths, Roger McGuinn of The Byrds, PJ Harvey and the pioneering guitarist Davey Graham. For Song Man he learned the basics of songwriting with the goal of recording a single at Toe-Rag Studios in London, this time picking up tips from Keith Richards, Andy Partridge of XTC, folk queen Shirley Collins and the hippy era songwriter Bridget St John. Guitar Man and Song Man are published in the US by Da Capo.\nIn 2007, Will launched a project in conjunction with the Guardian Newspaper to create and run a record label, 'Big Bertha', which he wrote about in a monthly column.  Acts signed to the label were Cornish folk band Thistletown and Pete Molinari.Will Hodgkinson is the brother of Tom Hodgkinson, editor of The Idler. Their father is the science writer Neville Hodgkinson and their mother is the non-fiction writer and journalist Liz Hodgkinson.Hodgkinson is married and has two children.According to an article in The Times (12th Nov 2015) took his first and so far only trip with LSD when he was 17 years old. On a sunny day in 1988 he and a friend went to a hilltop in Richmond Park to try the drug. His initial effect of the drugs were \"magical\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Van Morrison", "response": ["In June 2021, The Times noted that \"fittingly for someone who has been so vocally opposed to the lockdown\" resulting from the 2020-2021 coronavirus pandemic, \"Van Morrison played one of the first big-scale concerts in London since events, albeit tentatively, started up again.\" Will Hodgkinson wrote that the show \"was as good an argument for the return of live music as you could wish for.\""]}, {"page": "Raw Power", "response": ["Along with the Stooges' first two albums, Raw Power came to be regarded as an important proto-punk record in the years following its release. Writing of the album in retrospect, Will Hodgkinson believed that while the band's debut was \"charged and brutal garage-rock\" and Fun House was \"lurid chaos\", Raw Power was more musically sophisticated \"in its debauchery\". In The Trouser Press Guide to New Wave Records, Scott Isler credited Williamson's writing contributions with providing more musicality and structure to the band's songs, whose lyrics conflated sex and death. He regarded the album as \"heavy metal in every sense\" and \"another masterpiece\" from the group. Greg Kot also believed Raw Power was \"another masterpiece-more heavy metal than punk\", with songs more \"structured but no less forceful\". Nick Kent said in 2010 that Raw Power remains \"the greatest, meanest-eyed, coldest-blooded hard rock tour de force ever summoned up in a recording studio\". Christgau was somewhat less impressed. In his 1981 book Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies, he praised Williamson's guitar playing while writing that the side-opening tracks \"Search and Destroy\" and the title song \"voice the Iggy Pop ethos more insanely (and aggressively) than 'I Wanna Be Your Dog'\", but felt that \"the rest disperses in their wake\" and that Bowie had mixed the record too thinly."]}, {"page": "X Japan", "response": ["X Japan's appearance was inspired by glam rock, Kiss, David Bowie, as well as traditional Japanese kabuki theatre, where it was customary for male actors to play female roles and dress like women. Visual kei artists still often employ feminine looks and garbs for their stage. According to Josephine Yun, \"like its music, X's look was individualistic. Square-shouldered Toshi donned leather and metal, looking like a character out of the anime Gundam. Taiji dolled up in perfect, pretty glam. Pata's sleepy, backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark, as Hide forever goaded the audience. And Yoshiki was a paradox all his own, bewitchingly effeminate one moment \u2014 and a full-force, wrist-breaking (literally) hurricane in concert the next.\" Will Hodgkinson of The Times described X Japan as having, \"the grandiosity of Queen, the heavy-metal hysteria of Iron Maiden and the symphonic sophistication of classical music, all tied up with a healthy dose of melodrama.\""]}, {"page": "Bobby Gillespie", "response": ["Gillespie's book, Tenement Kid, a memoir relating his childhood in 1960s Springburn Glasgow, the discovering of punk, then his realization as an artist,  until the release of Screamadelica, was published in late 2021. The book was released to critical acclaim: the Scotsman wrote that \"Gillespie\u2019s autobiography is written with both passion and eloquence\", while the Irish Times wrote that Tenement Kid was \"a thrilling read\".

It and the Stooges' next two albums were later deemed \"proto-punk landmarks\", according to Mojo journalist Manish Agarwal. Daryl Easlea, writing for BBC Music, called the album \"rock at its most primordial.\u00a0... [the] album is the original punk rock rush on record, a long-held well-kept secret by those in the know.\" Mark Deming of AllMusic commented, \"Part of the fun of The Stooges is, then as now, the band managed the difficult feat of sounding ahead of their time and entirely out of their time, all at once.\""]}, {"page": "The Idler (1993)", "response": ["* Will Hodgkinson, music"]}, {"page": "Tom Hodgkinson", "response": ["Tom Hodgkinson was born in Newcastle, England.

Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails thought it did not go far enough, and accused Radiohead of using a compressed digital release as a bait-and-switch to promote a traditional record sale. Reznor independently released his sixth album Ghosts I\u2013IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year. Singer Lily Allen said the release was \"arrogant\" and sent a bad message to less successful acts, saying: \"You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?\" Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon said the release \"seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don't sell as many records [as Radiohead]. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever.\" Guardian journalist Will Hodgkinson argued that Radiohead had made it impossible for less successful musicians to make a living from their music.

Huntley views \"Isn't It a Pity\" as worthy of \"fully fledged standard\" status, with Barham's \"soaring\" strings and Harrison's \"sublime\" slide guitar combining to take the song \"into the heavens, where it stays\". Writing for Q magazine in 2002, John Harris said that All Things Must Pass was \"by some distance, the best Beatles solo album\" and the \"widescreen sound\" used by Harrison and Spector on tracks such as \"Isn't It a Pity\" had since been \"echoed in the work of such Beatles fans as ELO and Oasis\".John Harris, \"What Did George Harrison Ever Do for Us? ...\", Q, January 2002, pp. 34\u201335.

NME magazine's Angus Batey appraised it as one of the year's best albums and a richly detailed, enduring record that \"repays a decade and a half's faith and patience\". Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac said D'Angelo combined funk, R&B, and rock with emotionally varied, socially relevant lyrics on an album \"ever-worked, ever-tweaked, and perfected (in its distinctively imperfect way), but  and raw like little else\". The same publication's Jesse Cataldo called it \"a stunning collection of majestically constructed prog-soul\". In The Guardian, journalist Paul Lester deemed Black Messiah to be as much a socially conscious work as \"a restatement of faith in the principles and sounds of the pre-digital era of black music\", while Priya Elan of Mojo praised it as \"a beaming, single-minded statement of spiritual rebirth and political reckoning\" that finds D'Angelo appropriately political amid the 2014 Ferguson unrest.

Some of that genius is in evidence on this comeback of sorts, but it comes as damaged goods, with a sense of frantic chaos rather than contained energy ... The problem is that all kind of good musical and lyrical themes come across as thrown together, rather than making coherent sense ... Still, there are some gems buried among the cartoonish, throwaway moments ... It's a scrappy, unfocused album, and too long at 17 tracks, but it does reveal the life force beating away inside a fascinating, original, troubled man.\""]}, {"page": "Mark Fry", "response": ["In 2009 Fry was contacted by Dorset-based experimental musicians Michael Tanner and Nicholas Palmer, together known as The A.

In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said West's innovative transfiguration of his music\u2014with unrefined electronica and drill elements\u2014was undermined by his distasteful lyrics and appropriation of 1960s civil rights slogans \"to his own celebrity or to bedroom exploits\". In Robert Christgau's opinion, the combination of harsh rock and hip hop sounds on Yeezus was as bold as Public Enemy's music during the 1980s, but West's lyrics were grotesquely off-putting. \"He's wordsmith enough to insure that his sexist imagery is very hard to take\", Christgau wrote in The Barnes & Noble Review, looking at the album as an \"alt-rap also-ran\". Chris Richards from The Washington Post found West's lyricism perhaps \"his least compelling\" yet and \"drunk on bitterness\", though viewed the album as \"West at his most wasted, stumbling through rubble\". Alex Griffin of Tiny Mix Tapes expressed similar feelings, describing it as \"a nebulous, dense, paranoid web of utterly unfiltered expression that's utterly or negligibly fascinating depending on how much you care about Yeezy\".
