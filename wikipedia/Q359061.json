Her runaway mother has left Jal with her famous musician father and aspiring rapper brothers. She is best friends with Michelle. Maxxie Oliver (Mitch Hewer) is openly gay and has a passion for dance.

In \"Michelle\", Jal Fazer (Larissa Wilson) is able to recall a long list of his conquests. Michelle later puts to Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat) that he \"fucks everyone... including boys.\" In \"Maxxie & Anwar\", Tony attempts an oral tryst with his gay friend Maxxie (Mitch Hewer). Tony does not specify a sexual orientation but he says to Maxxie that he simply wants \"to try something new\". In a psychology lesson, he equates sex with power and his lust for both is portrayed in his presentation. An aspect of his subconscious (portrayed as a college headmaster) refers to him as \"polysexual\", in series two's \"Tony\" episode. Bryan Elsley characterizes Tony's attempt to seduce Maxxie as an exploration of the character's sexual fluidity; in season one of the American adaptation, Maxxie's character is replaced by the character Tea (Sofia Black-D'Elia), and her sexual fluidity is substituted for Tony's. In the British series, Tony fits the older television and film archetype of the \"narcissistic, controlling, and stereotypically sociopathic 'bad bisexual'\"."]}, {"page": "List of Skins characters", "response": ["| Mitch Hewer", "| Maxxie Oliver || Mitch Hewer || 1\u20132 || 1.06, 1.09, 2.01, 2.10"]}, {"page": "Maxxie Oliver", "response": ["Maxwell \"Maxxie\" Oliver is a fictional character in the British television series Skins.
