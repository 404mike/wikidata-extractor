Mentorn acquired the worldwide television rights from Profile in 1995 after Tom Gutteridge (the head of Mentorn) had seen an amateur tape of a San Francisco event.", "Profile sought no input or consent from Thorpe before doing this and this aggravated the already troubled relationship between Thorpe and Profile Records and indirectly spurred legal disagreements surrounding the ownership of the Robot Wars concept. The legal proceedings surrounding these would last until 6 February 2002. Mentorn used Thorpe as a Consultant on the series, however and the initial series of Robot Wars in the UK was broadcast over six weeks in February and March 1998. It was an immediate hit, with more than two million viewers and a further 18 episodes were commissioned by the BBC that year. 155 episodes were produced in total and the show was seen in 26 countries. Two series were produced in the US for The National Network (now Paramount Network) and a version was also shown on Nickelodeon. TechTV (and later G4techTV/G4) in the US aired the UK series proper. Series were also produced in many European countries. Although the series had various directors and producers, all were produced in the UK by Mentorn and executive produced by Tom Gutteridge and Steve Carsey.

In 1977 the usual grant from the Students' Union of \u00a3300/year was increased to \u00a33000 and this allowed the conversion of a Preparation Room behind the main Physics Department Lecture Hall into a small but exclusive studio for YSTV. At around the same time the society bought its first Sony Rover, which consisted of a black and white camera, smaller than the studio cameras, linked by cable to a reel-to-reel recording machine using half-inch video tape. This allowed much greater flexibility in producing programmes than before when students had been restricted to the studio. Here it remained for over two decades, until in June 1993 the University asked YSTV to vacate. Following a campaign supported by students, York University Students' Union, Greg Dyke and Tom Gutteridge, YSTV were offered a new studio on campus in Goodricke College (later becoming James College) which was officially opened by Greg Dyke on 29 October 1994."]}, {"page": "Gutteridge", "response": ["* Tom Gutteridge (born 1952), British television producer"]}, {"page": "British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Programme", "response": ["| The Hot Shoe Show || Tom Gutteridge", "| Robot Wars || Tom Gutteridge, Stephen Carsey, Bill Hobbins"]}, {"page": "01-for London", "response": ["01-for London was a Thames Television programme broadcast on  ITV in South-East England between 1987 and 1992.
