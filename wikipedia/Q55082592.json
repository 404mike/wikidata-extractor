She worked with Rachel Barrett, Elsa Gye and Mary Gawthorpe during the Dundee by-election the next year. In 1908, Fraser attended the 'monster meeting' Women's Sunday and wrote to Isabel Seymour that it was 'successful but not entirely satisfactory', Fraser estimated half a million people attended ( a number supported by The Times estimates) but said that at three of the speaker platforms 'there was much rowdyism' and said 'it seemed to me that the mass of people were simply curious - not opposed- simply indifferent. Fraser  was also becoming disillusioned with the violent militant tactics of the WSPU. She criticised the actions of one WSPU member who broke the windows of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She resigned from the WSPU soon afterwards, and was approached by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) and agreed to work for them. She was a member of the NUWSS national executive committee for fourteen years."]}]}}
