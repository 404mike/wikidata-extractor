Malcolm Boyle - who wrote the Nebulous theme and edited the pilot - had written an entire original score for the show. However, due to BBC radio budget limitations, this was not used in the completed series. Nicholas Briggs had also originally created a very deep, realistic soundscape, similar to those he had created for the Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audioplays, but was advised that \"it's likely the listener will have distractions and will not listen to it more than once; therefore, the soundscape must be totally accessible from any point in the episode\", toning down the sound effects to match the series' comic nature."]}, {"page": "Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle", "response": ["* The Revd Canon Edmund Fellowes, 1924\u20131927, Acting Master of the Choristers, with GS Kitchingman and later Malcolm Boyle, as Acting Organist", "*Malcolm Boyle 1925 \u2013 1932"]}, {"page": "St Giles Church, West Bridgford", "response": ["*Malcolm Boyle 1957 - 1961"]}, {"page": "1976 in British music", "response": ["*date unknown - Malcolm Boyle, organist and composer, 74"]}, {"page": "Organ and organists of Chester Cathedral", "response": ["The organists of Chester Cathedral have included the composers Robert White and Malcolm Boyle.
