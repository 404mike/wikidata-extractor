Stroud: Sutton but he appears to have had some authority in Cornwall, for in 1027 his counsellor Lyfing of Winchester (already bishop of Crediton) was appointed as bishop of Cornwall (St Germans), beginning the merger which would later form the See of Exeter. The map pictured, by William R. Shepherd (1926), shows Cornwall as not part of Canute's realm, but this approach is not followed by more recent scholarship, such as David Hill's An Atlas of Anglo-Saxon England (1981). Ultimately, the Danes' control of Wessex was lost in 1042 with the death of both of Canute's sons (Edward the Confessor retook Wessex for the Anglo-Saxons)."]}]}}
