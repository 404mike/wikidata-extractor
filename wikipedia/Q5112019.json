When Yubi and Zax land on Earth, they are befriended by a stray dog named Benji who remains their companion for the run of the series. Two Antarian bounty hunters named Darah and Khyber, along with their droid Zord (Level 10 programing), are sent to Earth to find and to capture Yubi. Most of the plot involves Darah and Khyber chasing Benji, Zax and Yubi in a black Chevy van, and their efforts almost always end in failure, usually due to some failure of one or both of them combined with Benji's incredible intelligence and loyal assistance. There is never any doubt that Benji is a major heroic figure for this show who seems to do an often better job protecting his highness than the level 2 droid assigned to him."]}, {"page": "Paul Harkin", "response": ["Harkin played  (replaced by interchange/substitute Christopher Burton) in Hull Kingston Rovers' 4\u201312 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1981\u201382 John Player Trophy Final during the 1981\u201382 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 23 January 1982, played , and was man of the match in the 12\u20130 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1984\u201385 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1984\u201385 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 26 January 1985, and played , and was man of the match in the 8\u201311 defeat by Wigan in the 1985\u201386 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1985\u201386 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 11 January 1986."]}, {"page": "Chris Burton", "response": ["* Christopher Burton (born 1956), British rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Yorkshire Cup", "response": ["|Christopher Burton||12||Peter Smith"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Challenge Cup", "response": ["|SR ||12|| Christopher Burton"]}, {"page": "Chris Burton (rugby league)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Burton"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 League Cup (rugby league)", "response": ["|Kevin Harkin (for Tony Dean)||14||Christopher Burton (for Paul Harkin)"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 League Cup (rugby league)", "response": ["|Christopher Burton||11||Lee Crooks"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 League Cup (rugby league)", "response": ["|Graeme West||11||Christopher Burton"]}, {"page": "List of Leeds Rhinos players with honours", "response": ["* Christopher Burton"]}, {"page": "Paul Lyman", "response": ["Lyman made his d\u00e9but for Featherstone Rovers on Sunday 21 November 1982,Bailey, Ron (20 September 2001).
