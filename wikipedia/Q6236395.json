A lower-order left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm spin bowler, he played in 34 matches without ever establishing himself as a regular in the Gloucestershire first team. His most productive season was 1953, when he played in 13 matches and made his highest score, 32 against Combined Services. But in those 13 matches he took only 16 wickets.Competing for a place in a Gloucestershire side that already boasted a Test slow left-armer in Sam Cook and future Test offbreak bowlers in John Mortimore and David Allen, plus the irrepressible Bryan Wells, Griffiths' opportunities got fewer rather than greater across the mid 1950s. His best bowling figures were four-wicket hauls in matches against university sides in 1955 and 1956, with four for 74 the best.Griffiths played Minor Counties cricket for Gloucestershire as early as 1948 and played on through the 1958 season, though his last first-class appearance was in 1957. In the early 1960s, he made occasional appearances for Somerset's second eleven, and appeared in one further match for Gloucestershire's second eleven too. \nIn the late 1970s, he was an umpire standing in Minor Counties and Second Eleven Championship matches and in 1979, he stood for one season as an umpire in first-class and List A matches, though he was not reappointed in 1980. He died at Wedmore, Somerset, aged 51.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Griffiths", "response": ["John Griffiths may refer to:", "*John Griffiths (Welsh politician) (born 1956), Welsh Labour Party politician", "*John Griffiths (Conservative politician) (born 1953), British local government leader", "*John Griffiths (Liberal politician) (born 1934), British politician and author", "*John Griffiths (cricketer, born 1863) (1863\u2013?), cricketer", "*John Griffiths (cricketer, born 1931) (1931\u20131982), cricketer", "*John Griffiths (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u20131953), English football wing half (Grimsby Town)", "*John Griffiths (footballer, born 1951) (born 1951), English football midfielder (Aston Villa, Stockport County)", "*John Griffiths (Medal of Honor) (1835\u2013?), American Civil War soldier and sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Griffiths (shipowner) (1801\u20131881), Australian colonial shipowner and builder", "*John Griffiths (academic) (1806\u20131885), English academic and Warden of Wadham College, Oxford", "*John Griffiths (artist) (1837\u20131918), artist who worked in India", "*John Griffiths (curator) (1952\u20132010), Welsh museum curator", "*John Griffiths (mathematician) (1837/8\u20131916), Welsh mathematician", "*John Griffiths (musician) (born 1952), Australian vihuelist and musicologist", "*John Griffiths (surgeon) (1754\u20131822), Surgeon to Queen Charlotte's household", "*John Griffiths (Archdeacon of Llandaff) (1820\u20131897)"]}, {"page": "John Griffiths (Gloucestershire cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Griffiths (cricketer, born 1931)"]}]}}
