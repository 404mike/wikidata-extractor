The theory can be derived from William Stanley Jevons' ordinal utility theory, which posits that individuals can always rank any consumption bundles by order of preference."]}, {"page": "Alfred Marshall", "response": ["Marshall was elected in 1865 to a fellowship at St John's College at Cambridge, and became lecturer in the moral sciences in 1868. In 1885 he became professor of political economy at Cambridge, where he remained until his retirement in 1908.  Over the years he interacted with many British thinkers including Henry Sidgwick, W.K.
