Unlike his relatives William and Hardress Waller, he was Royalist in sympathy and was accused in 1643 of organising a plot to seize London for Charles I. He allegedly escaped the death penalty by paying a large bribe, while several conspirators were executed, including his brother-in-law Nathaniel Tomkins.\nAfter his sentence was commuted to banishment, he lived in comfortable exile in France and Switzerland until allowed home in 1651 by Oliver Cromwell, a distant relative. He returned to Parliament after The Restoration in 1660 of Charles II; known as a fine and amusing orator, he held a number of minor offices. He largely retired from active politics after the death of his second wife in 1677, and died of edema in October 1687.\nBest remembered now for his poem \"Song (Go, lovely rose)\", Waller's earliest writing dates to the late 1630s, commemorating events that occurred in the 1620s, including a piece on Charles's escape from a shipwreck at Santander in 1625. Written in heroic couplets, it is one of the first examples of a form used by English poets for some two centuries; his verse was admired by John Dryden among others, while he was a close friend of Thomas Hobbes and John Evelyn.\nWhen he died, Waller was considered a major English poet, but his reputation declined over the next century, one view seeing him as a 'fairweather Royalist, an expedient Republican and mercenary bridegroom'. He is now regarded as a minor author, whose primary significance was to develop a form adapted and improved by later poets like Alexander Pope.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bermuda", "response": ["Bermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands.

A second edition appeared in the following year with extra commendatory verses in Latin and English, some of which bore the names of Nahum Tate, Thomas Otway, Aphra Behn, Richard Duke, and Edmund Waller; and when Dryden published his translations from Theocritus, Lucretius, and Horace, he made flattering comments on Creech's work in the preface. Creech's Lucretius was often reprinted, and was included in the edition of the British poets which was issued by Robert Anderson. An edition appeared in 1714 containing translations of verses previously omitted and numerous notes from another hand designed to set forth a complete system of Epicurean philosophy."]}, {"page": "Elijah Fenton", "response": ["In 1707, Fenton published a book of poems. He later became tutor to Sir William Trumbull's son at Easthampstead Park in Berkshire and is now best known as the assistant of his neighbour, Alexander Pope, in his translation of the Odyssey, of which he 'Englished' the first, fourth, nineteenth, and twentieth books, catching the manner of his master so completely that it is hardly possible to distinguish between their work; while thus engaged he published (1723) a successful tragedy, Mariamne. His later contributions to literature were a Life of John Milton, and as an editor of Edmund Waller's Poems (1729)."]}, {"page": "Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets", "response": ["* Edmund Waller"]}, {"page": "Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset", "response": ["He was a generous patron of men of letters. When John Dryden was dismissed from the laureateship, he made him an equivalent pension from his own purse. Matthew Prior, in dedicating his Poems on Several Occasions (1709) to Dorset's son, affirms that his opinion was consulted by Edmund Waller; that the Duke of Buckingham deferred the publication of his Rehearsal until he was assured that Dorset would not rehearse upon him again; and that Samuel Butler and William Wycherley both owed their first recognition to him. Prior's praise of Dorset is no doubt extravagant, but when his youthful follies were over he appears to have developed sterling qualities, and although the poems he has left are very few, none of them are devoid of merit. Dryden's Essay on Satire and the dedication of the Essay of Dramatick Poesie are addressed to him. Walpole (Catalogue of Noble Authors, iv.) says that he had as much wit as his first master, or his contemporaries Buckingham and Rochester, without the royal want of feeling, the duke's want of principles or the earl's want of thought; and Congreve reported of him when he was dying that he slabbered more wit than other people had in their best health."]}, {"page": "Oxford period poetry anthologies", "response": ["Henry Aldrich \u2013 Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling \u2013 Jacob Allestry \u2013 Mary Astell \u2013 William Austin \u2013 Sir Robert Ayton \u2013 William Basse \u2013 Richard Baxter \u2013 Francis Beaumont \u2013 Sir John Beaumont \u2013 Joseph Beaumont \u2013 Thomas Beedome \u2013 Aphra Behn \u2013 Edward Benlowes \u2013 Henry Bold \u2013 Anne Bradstreet \u2013 Richard Brathwait \u2013 Alexander Brome \u2013 Sir Thomas Browne \u2013 William Browne of Tavistock \u2013 John Bunyan \u2013 Robert Burton \u2013 Samuel Butler \u2013 Thomas Campian \u2013 Thomas Carew \u2013 James Carkesse \u2013 William Cartwright \u2013 Patrick Cary \u2013 Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle \u2013 William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle \u2013 John Chalkhill \u2013 William Chamberlayne \u2013 George Chapman \u2013 John Cleveland \u2013 John Collop \u2013 Richard Corbett \u2013 Charles Cotton \u2013 Abraham Cowley \u2013 Richard Crashaw \u2013 Hugh Crompton \u2013 John Cutts, Lord Cutts \u2013 Alicia D'Anvers \u2013 Thomas D'Urfey \u2013 John Dancer \u2013 George Daniel \u2013 Samuel Daniel \u2013 Sir William Davenant \u2013 Robert Davenport \u2013 Thomas Dekker \u2013 Sir John Denham \u2013 John Digby, Earl of Bristol \u2013 John Donne \u2013 Michael Drayton \u2013 William Drummond of Hawthornden \u2013 John Dryden \u2013 Richard Duke \u2013 'Ephelia' \u2013 Sir George Etherege \u2013 Mary Evelyn \u2013 Thomas Fairfax, Lord Fairfax \u2013 Mildmay Fane, Earl of Westmorland \u2013 Sir Richard Fanshawe \u2013 Henry Farley \u2013 George Farquhar \u2013 Owen Feltham \u2013 Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea \u2013 Thomas Flatman \u2013 Richard Flecknoe \u2013 Giles Fletcher \u2013 John Fletcher \u2013 Phineas Fletcher \u2013 John Ford \u2013 Simon Ford \u2013 Thomas Forde \u2013 Sidney Godolphin \u2013 James Graham, Marquis of Montrose \u2013 Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke \u2013 William Habington \u2013 Henry Hall \u2013 John Hall \u2013 Henry Halswell \u2013 William Hammond \u2013 Samuel Harding \u2013 Sir John Harington \u2013 Christopher Harvey \u2013 Sir R.
