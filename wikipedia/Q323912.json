Despite being over 1400 pages, the book was described by the authors as being \"strictly adapted to the needs of the beginner\". On account of Parker's death the second edition of this standard textbook, which appeared in 1910, was prepared by Haswell, as was also the edition which came out in January 1922. A fourth edition was released in 1928 and it remained a standard in Australian zoology courses for decades. He also published a Manual of Zoology in 1899 which was reprinted in 1908. In 1913 a chair of botany was created at the university of Sydney and Haswell became professor of zoology."]}, {"page": "Otago University Debating Society", "response": ["* Thomas Jeffery Parker zoologist"]}, {"page": "William Kitchen Parker", "response": ["William and Elizabeth had seven children, three daughters and four sons. The first son, Thomas Jeffery Parker, became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in the University of Otago, New Zealand; the second, William Newton Parker, became Professor of Biology in the University College, Cardiff; the third was a draughtsman and lithographer; the fourth was a surgeon. In his work on the vertebrate skull Parker became close to Thomas Henry Huxley, and named one of his sons after him. His first son was sent to study under Huxley, and became in 1872 one of Huxley's demonstrators.Parker, Thomas Jeffery \u2013 Biography \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand"]}, {"page": "Otago Museum", "response": ["His successor, Thomas Jeffery Parker, was an outstanding researcher and one of New Zealand's greatest biologists.

The humanities collection was started during Parker's time, prompted by the donation of an ancient Egyptian mummy by Bendix Hallenstein."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R", "response": ["| Thomas Jeffery Parker||7 June 1888||17 October 1850 \u2013 7 November 1897"]}, {"page": "T.

The visit both enabled him to assess the status of science in the country and provided him with the empirical basis on which he developed a teaching programme best suited to the needs of his students. It also opened up an informal network of local scientific researchers; he became particularly close to Parker with whom he initiated a research project focussing on the embryology of the Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus).A P W Thomas, 'Preliminary note on development of Tuatara', Proceedings of the Royal Society, London, vol. 48 (1890), p. 152."]}, {"page": "Josephine Rich", "response": ["Rich was one of only four New Zealand women who published results of her scientific work before 1901.

The paper described in detail the entire musculature of the animal; it was read before the Otago Institute in 1892 and published in the Maclay Memorial Volume of the New South Wales Linnean Society in 1893. Rich provided 25 of the 27 images in the paper, which were described as \"remarkably clear\" by a reviewer in the London review journal Natural Science."]}]}}
