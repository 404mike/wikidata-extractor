Starling was an inside forward who made 413 appearances in all competitions, never a high scoring inside forward he was a player who created chances for other players, notching a modest 65 goals throughout his career.

Albion however started to play some good football and got themselves back into the match after 21 minutes when the youngest player on the field, 22-year-old Wally Boyes, a boyhood Wednesdayite from Sheffield scored an equaliser. The diminutive left winger took a pass from Carter and hit a stinging, rising drive from the left side of the penalty area which gave Jack Brown no chance. The score remained at 1\u20131 until half time.", "The early stages of the second half saw Ronnie Starling miss a chance and then have another effort cleared off the line. Not to be deterred Starling was prominent in Wednesday re-taking the lead on 70 minutes when his pass released Mark Hooper who beat two men before hitting a shot past Harold Pearson that went in off a post. Within five minutes West Brom were level as a Teddy Sandford shot was deflected into the net off Walt Millership. At this stage West Brom looked the likely winners with some of the Wednesday players arguing amongst themselves as they kicked off. It was during this stage of the game that the limping Joe Carter missed his two good chances, hitting the post with one of them. W. G. Richardson also missed a fine opportunity. With only five minutes remaining and extra time looking a distinct possibility Ellis Rimmer, who had had a quiet match up till that point made his mark on the match. He chased a long through ball from Wilf Sharp and the tall winger got his head to the ball just before West Brom keeper Pearson could reach it and guided it into the net. In the final minute Rimmer scored his second goal when Pearson could only parry a Mark Hooper shot and Rimmer knocked the ball home from close range. Wednesday had won the cup and Ellis Rimmer had scored in every round.\"Sheffield Football, A History\", Keith Farnsworth,  Page 200 (Gives details of match).\"Wednesday\", Keith Farnsworth, pages 132\u2013135 (Gives details of match and team selections).", "Sheffield Wednesday have yet to win the FA Cup since their 1935 triumph; their only major trophy during that time was the Football League Cup in 1991.

Surtees retained his place, even though Starling returned to the side with Harry Burgess losing his position in the team after a fall out with the manager.

In the second half of that season Palethorpe played an integral part in Sheffield Wednesday's excellent run and eventual triumph in the FA Cup of that season scoring goals in the third and fourth rounds as well as one in the semi-final win over Burnley at Villa Park. However his most important goal came in the 4\u20132 final triumph against West Bromwich Albion when he put Wednesday a goal up inside two minutes after receiving a pass from Ronnie Starling and shooting just inside the post.
