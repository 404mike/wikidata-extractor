She was best known for developing the skirt dance and has been called the \"greatest dancer of her time\".After performing as a young girl, Vaughan had a seven-year engagement at the Gaiety Theatre in London from 1876 to 1883, where she joined its Victorian burlesque troupe that included Nellie Farren and Edward Terry. In 1884 she married Colonel the Hon Frederick Arthur Wellesley, youngest son of the 1st Earl Cowley. She retired from dancing in 1885 and soon began to tour in classic comedies with considerable success. From about 1896 her health began to deteriorate, but she continued to perform until her death.", "link_mentions": {}}}
