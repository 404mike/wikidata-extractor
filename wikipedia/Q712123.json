The new appeasement was a mood of fear, Hobbesian in its insistence upon swallowing the bad in order to preserve some remnant of the good, pessimistic in its belief that Nazism was there to stay and, however horrible it might be, should be accepted as a way of life with which Britain ought to deal.\"Gilbert, M., The Roots of Appeasement, 1968"]}, {"page": "Power (international relations)", "response": ["Much effort in academic and popular writing is devoted to deciding which countries have the status of \"power\", and how this can be measured.
