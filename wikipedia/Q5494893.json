The opening game of the 1896 Home Nations Championship saw Wales suffer a terrible seven try to nil defeat away to England. This forced the Welsh selectors to make massive changes to the Welsh pack, which contained several veteran Welsh forwards of the 1893 Triple Crown winning side. Five new caps were brought into the team for the second match of the Championship, with Hutchinson regaining his place as one of only three returning players in the pack. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, the Welsh beat Scotland 6\u20130 at the Cardiff Arms Park, and Hutchinson was brought back for the final game of the series away to Ireland. Again the Welsh struggled in Ireland losing 4\u20138. Hutchinson was replaced the next season by Fred Cornish and did not represent Wales again."]}, {"page": "David Daniel (rugby union)", "response": ["Another four seasons passed, and Daniel was again back in favour with the Welsh selectors, when he came into the Welsh squad to face Ireland as part of the 1898 Home Nations Championship. This was the first Wales match after the Gould Affair, and Daniel found himself the veteran pack leader, with five of the pack newly capped that match, and the other two positions held by Fred Cornish and Dick Hellings, both having played just a single game each. This meant that Daniel had twice as many caps as the entire seven other pack members combined. Despite the inexperience of the Welsh pack, Wales were victorious over the Irish, winning 11-3. The selectors reacted by keeping faith in the Welsh squad, which saw no newly capped players, and Daniel leading out an almost unchanged pack against England at Blackheath. Despite a try and a dropped goal from Viv Huzzey, Wales lost the game."]}, {"page": "Tom Dobson", "response": ["In 1898, Wales were readmitted into the Home Nations Championship after agreements were made to settle the Gould Affair. Dobson was one of seven new caps introduced into the Welsh team, and one of five in a vastly changed pack. Although the back positions were full of Cardiff players, Dobson was only supported by one teammate in the pack, Fred Cornish, who was only collecting his second cap that match. The game was played away against Ireland, and without Arthur Gould, Wales were now captained by experienced fullback Billy Bancroft. Bancroft was in good form during the match scoring a penalty goal and a conversion. Two tries were scored by Wales in an 11-3 win, one from Viv Huzzey and the other scored by Dobson himself; his first and only international score. After the win, Dobson was reselected in a near unchanged squad that faced and lost to England in the final match of the 1898 Championship."]}, {"page": "Cornish (surname)", "response": ["* Fred Cornish (1876\u20131940), Wales international rugby player"]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union families", "response": ["*Arthur Cornish and Fred Cornish; Arthur was Fred's nephew"]}]}}
