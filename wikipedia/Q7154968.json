There Pauline, Lady Trevelyan commissioned him, after coming across his 1850 Memoir of his brother David Scott. He produced eight large pictures illustrating Northumbrian history, with life-size figures, supplemented by eighteen pictures on The Ballad of Chevy Chase in the spandrels of the arches of the hall.

While in Scotland with Ruskin (still her husband) and Millais, she gathered foxgloves to place in her hair. She wore them at breakfast despite being asked by her husband not to do so, a gesture of defiance, at a time of growing crisis in their relationship, that came to the critical notice of Florence NightingaleSuzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais. Florence Nightingale's observations regarding the foxgloves are noted in correspondence of her friend, the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell, whose acquaintance with Effie Ruskin dated back to their schooldays. However, it is unclear when Nightingale herself met Effie: Cooper, op.cit, footnote 85. (Gaskell was especially well connected. In 1861, for example, she was part of a house party at Fryston Hall, Yorkshire given by Richard Monckton Milnes \u2013 a persistent suitor of Florence Nightingale \u2013 that included also the MP William Forster, Austen Layard, who excavated the biblical city of Ninevah, and the American (Union) Minister in London, Charles Francis Adams. Gaskell was among a group visiting nearby Pomfret Castle when Adam received news of the Trent incident that, in the early stages of the American Civil War almost brought Britain and the Union to war: see Amanda Foreman (2010)  A World on Fire.)

A few weeks earlier, on Midsummer Day, Effie (possibly inspired by Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream) was said by her hostess, Pauline Trevelyan, to have \"looked lovely\" with stephanotis in her hair at an evening party in Northumberland,Diary of Pauline, Lady Trevelyan, 24 June 1853, quoted in Robert Brownwell (2013) Marriage of Inconvenience while, the previous year, a male friend had brought glass flowers for her hair from Venice.Brownwell, op.cit.

His most famous work was Paolo and Francesca, which was exhibited at the 1851 exhibition. It depicted the lovers as languid, dreamy and genteel, contributing to the popular image of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. The final marble version is in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. The original plaster version of the sculpture is currently on display in Wallington Hall, which also contains a portrait relief bust of Pauline, Lady Trevelyan created by Munro."]}, {"page": "Pauline (given name)", "response": ["*Pauline, Lady Trevelyan {1816\u20131866), English painter"]}, {"page": "Pauline Trevelyan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pauline, Lady Trevelyan"]}, {"page": "Pauline Jermyn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pauline, Lady Trevelyan"]}, {"page": "Louisa Baring, Lady Ashburton", "response": ["Of fiery temper, insatiable restlessness, and socially ambitious, she collected paintings and important friends with an almost manic need.
