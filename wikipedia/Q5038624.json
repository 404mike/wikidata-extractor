He also said that he wanted to be a teacher in either mainland China or in Africa, as there was a shortage of teachers in Africa. Democratic Party ex-chairman Martin Lee, also a Roman Catholic, stated that because Zen was still healthy for his age, the Pope may request him to stay in his position.  Legislative Council member Audrey Eu praised Zen for being braver than other religious leaders in Hong Kong in sharing his political views and also because \"he carried out his ideas of fairness, equitableness, and philanthropy via actual efforts\". On the other hand, some conservatives inside the church speculated that the strained relationship between Beijing and the Holy See will become more relaxed if Zen retires. Nonetheless, Zen wrote a letter to the Pope on 13 January 2006 and stated that he did want to retire from his position, though not because of his age. On 15 April 2009 Pope Benedict accepted Cardinal Zen's resignation and John Tong Hon became the Bishop of the diocese.", "From 22 October 2011 for three days Cardinal Zen went on hunger strike which was undertaken as an act of protest against losing a long-standing legal battle with the Hong Kong government over how aided schools should be run.

In an interview he told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: \u201cI would tell him now, \u2018Don\u2019t come, you would be manipulated'. ...The few courageous [Catholics] could not meet [the Pope], and the Communist Party would show him the illegitimate bishops, including the three excommunicated ones.\u201d The comments came as ties between the Vatican and China improved in the early days of the pontificate of Francis, with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs congratulating Francis on his election. Cardinal Zen said he did not see signs of dialogue happening between the Catholic Church and China. \u201cEven if under these conditions Beijing was to extend a hand, it would be a trick under these circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cOur poor bishops are slaves, the Communist Party denies them respect, tries to take away their dignity.\u201d", "In September 2014 as part of the 2014 Hong Kong protests, Cardinal Zen addressed the protesters saying \"It's high time we really showed that we want to be free and not to be slaves. ...

He was there [in the Secretariat of State] so many years, so he must know. He may be happy to encourage the pope to be optimistic about the negotiations \u2026 but that\u2019s dangerous. Pope Francis needs someone to calm him down from his enthusiasm.\u201d Zen added that  \u201cIt seems the Secretary of State wants to have a solution anyway. He is so optimistic. That\u2019s dangerous. I told the pope that he [Parolin] has a poisoned mind. He is very sweet, but I have no trust in this person.
