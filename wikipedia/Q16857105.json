As a boy he was taught the violin by Anton\u00edn Kammel, and later by Wilhelm Cramer, leader of the Italian Opera orchestra at the King's Theatre. Blake himself played the violin in this orchestra from about 1775, and also at the Concert of Ancient Music. He came into public prominence however as a viola player. He was principal and soloist at the Professional Concert from 1785 to 1793, appearing regularly in string quartets with Cramer. He also played the viola at the Prince of Wales's musical evenings, and his unusual interest in this instrument led to his publishing 18 duos for violin and viola in the 1780s. After the 1793 season Blake resigned from public performance. He was already studying the piano under Clementi to equip himself as a teacher, and though he continued to play the viola for the Prince of Wales he lived almost entirely by teaching until 1820 when he retired. Some of his duos merit revival, as also his sonatas for violin and piano, which were published in score and show an interesting taste for minor keys; the violin parts are called \u2018accompaniments\u2019 on the title page, but wrongly.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of violists", "response": ["* Benjamin Blake (1751\u20131827), composer, violinist"]}, {"page": "Blake (surname)", "response": ["*Benjamin Blake (1751\u20131827), English violinist"]}, {"page": "List of compositions for viola: A to B", "response": ["* Benjamin Blake (1751\u20131827)"]}, {"page": "John Crosdill", "response": ["By his will signed at 45 Berners Street on 30 August 1825 and proved at London on 25 October 1825, his son from a subsequent marriage, Lieutenant Colonel John Crosdill of the East India Company, inherited a substantial fortune.
