He joined the Labour Party in 1970 and has held most party offices. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Rotherham from 1994 to his resignation in 2012.\nBorn in Glasgow to an Irish mother and Polish father who died from war related illness in 1958, MacShane was educated on a Middlesex County scholarship at St Benedict's School, Ealing and studied at Merton College, Oxford. He worked as a BBC journalist and trade unionist before completing a PhD at Birkbeck, University of London. He contested the Solihull constituency in October 1974 but was unsuccessful. After failing to be selected to contest a constituency at the 1992 general election, he was elected to parliament for Rotherham at a 1994 by-election. Following the 2001 general election, he was appointed a junior minister at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In April 2002, he became Minister of State for Europe and was appointed to the Privy Council. He returned to the backbenches after the 2005 general election.\nIn November 2012, Labour suspended MacShane when the Standards and Privileges Committee found he had submitted 19 false invoices \"plainly intended to deceive\" the parliamentary expenses authority. The allegations, which were made by the British National Party, had been investigated for 20 months by the Metropolitan Police. After the Commons upheld the complaint, he announced his intention to resign as MP for Rotherham and from the Privy Council. In November 2013, he pleaded guilty to false accounting at the Old Bailey, by submitting false receipts for \u00a312,900. On 23 December, he was sentenced to four months in prison. He served his sentence in HM Prison Belmarsh and HM Prison Brixton, and subsequently by wearing an electronic tag.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 21", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 Denis MacShane, Scottish journalist and politician, UK Minister of State for Europe"]}, {"page": "Privy Council of the United Kingdom", "response": ["So far, three privy counsellors have resigned in the 21st century, coincidentally all in the same year.

Although Lynn comments that the word \"spin\" has \"probably entered the political vocabulary since the series,\" Iannucci suggests that the show \"taught us how to unpick the verbal tricks that politicians think they can get away with in front of the cameras.\" The series depicted the media-consciousness of politicians, reflecting the public relations training they undergo to help them deal with interviews and reading from autocue effectively. This is particularly evident in the episode \"The Ministerial Broadcast\", in which Hacker is advised on the effects of his clothes and surroundings. The episode \"A Conflict of Interest\" humorously lampoons the various political stances of Britain's newspapers through their readers (although this material was not original):There are various versions of the \"Times is read by the people who run the country\" patter, which has been attributed to an anonymous advertising copywriter: see, for example, J.

His poem \"Killed in Crossfire\" when published in British newspaper The Observer aroused some controversy for referring to a Palestinian boy being \"gunned down by the Zionist SS\". According to Denis MacShane in Globalising Hatred: The New Antisemitism (2008), it was Paulin's expression of his \"anger and anguish at the behaviour of Israeli troops\". In an interview he gave to the state-owned Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly, Paulin described Israeli government actions in Palestine as \"an historical obscenity\". When asked how he responds to accusations of anti-Semitism that follow such descriptions, he told the newspaper \"I just laugh when they do that to me. It does not worry me at all. These are the Hampstead liberal Zionists. I have utter contempt for them. They use this card of anti-Semitism\". Regarding supporters of Israel, Paulin stated \"You are either a Zionist or an anti-Zionist. Everyone who supports Israel is a Zionist\".'That weasel word' Al-Ahram Weekly Online, 4\u201310 April 2002 After his comments in Al-Ahram raised controversy, he said in a letter to The Independent and the Daily Telegraph, that his views were \"distorted\", writing, \"I have been, and am, a lifelong opponent of anti-Semitism ...
