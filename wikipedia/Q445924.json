The British transferred the island to the locals that day, and it was administered by Archpriest Saverio Cassar on behalf of Ferdinand III of Sicily. Gozo remained independent until Cassar was removed from power by the British in 1801.", "General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois surrendered his French forces in 1800. Maltese leaders presented the main island to Sir Alexander Ball, asking that the island become a British Dominion. The Maltese people created a Declaration of Rights in which they agreed to come \"under the protection and sovereignty of the King of the free people, His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". The Declaration also stated that \"his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power...if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control.\""]}, {"page": "September 11", "response": ["*1800 \u2013 The Maltese National Congress Battalions are disbanded by British Civil Commissioner Alexander Ball."]}, {"page": "Samuel Taylor Coleridge", "response": ["In 1804, he travelled to Sicily and Malta, working for a time as Acting Public Secretary of Malta under the Civil Commissioner, Alexander Ball, a task he performed successfully. He lived in San Anton Palace in the village of Attard.  He gave this up and returned to England in 1806. Dorothy Wordsworth was shocked at his condition upon his return. From 1807 to 1808, Coleridge returned to Malta and then travelled in Sicily and Italy, in the hope that leaving Britain's damp climate would improve his health and thus enable him to reduce his consumption of opium. Thomas De Quincey alleges in his Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets that it was during this period that Coleridge became a full-blown opium addict, using the drug as a substitute for the lost vigour and creativity of his youth.  It has been suggested that this reflects De Quincey's own experiences more than Coleridge's."]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1799", "response": ["* Malta Protectorate \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1799\u20131801)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1800", "response": ["* Malta Protectorate \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1799\u20131801)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1801", "response": ["*# Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1799\u20131801)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1802", "response": ["*# Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1802\u20131809)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1803", "response": ["* Malta Protectorate \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1802\u20131809)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1804", "response": ["* Malta Protectorate \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1802\u20131809)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1805", "response": ["* Malta \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1802\u20131809)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1806", "response": ["* Malta Protectorate \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1802\u20131809)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1807", "response": ["* Malta Protectorate \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1802\u20131809)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1808", "response": ["* Malta \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1802\u20131809)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1809", "response": ["* Malta Protectorate \u2013 Alexander Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta (1802\u20131809)"]}, {"page": "Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois", "response": ["Still, on 18 September, a Portuguese squadron of four ships began a blockade of Malta. That blockade - although varying in the number and national composition of the ships - continued until the French surrendered.  Nelson dispatched British forces under the command of Captain Alexander Ball, who arrived on 12 October 1798. The Maltese insurrectionist forces forced the French to withdraw to Valletta and the Three Cities around the Grand Harbour. On 28 October Gozo Island fell as the French commander there surrendered himself and his 217 men to Captain Ball. With General Vaubois's forces besieged in Valletta, Captain Ball's ships continued the blockade.

The French garrison had eaten all the horses, the mules, the dogs, the cats and the rats of Valletta. Finally, on 4 September 1800, Vaubois sent an emissary under a flag of truce to the British commander Major-General Henry Pigot. The following day, Pigot and Captain George Martin, RN, negotiated terms of surrender with General Vaubois and contre-amiral Villeneuve. (Ironically the French excluded Captain Alexander Ball, as chief of the Maltese, from the negotiations, as the French did not want to surrender to the Maltese.) The British granted Vaubois and the French fair terms and the honors of war, including the right to keep their arms and spoils.

James Watt borrowed that information to make a better steam engine. Watt is linked to Roebuck who discovered chlorine bleach which eventually is used to make white paper.

It was amongst the first public institutions to be reestablished. The documents of the Tribunale della Gran Corte della Castellania were given by Government Alexander Ball to the Gran Corte Vescovile (Court of the Bishop) with other documents of the church and the Inquisition at the request of the ecclesiastic authorities. Apart from those of the Court of the Bishop, the others (including those of the Castellania) were all found to be irrelevant to the church and were transferred to the Palace of the Inquisition in Birgu. The documents of the Tribunale della Valletta were likely transferred to the palace of the Inquisition by mistake but those arriving there never saw their way back to Valletta since. On 8 March 1805, a proclamation declared the restoration of the Courts of Justice. In February 1806, Ball gave instructions to presumably guarantee independence of the Judiciary, whereas the Judges could not be removed at a simple request, and legal persons would not be threatened to be jailed if they disagree with signing legal documents. At the request of the Maltese National Congress, the law was once again reformed to the ancient rights and the Code De Rohan.", "Maltese courts became  on 5 October 1813, months before the Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony.

Some rooms in San Anton Palace were used as a post office, and mail was sent to Sicily every week. After Malta had become a British protectorate in 1800, the Island Post Office was established as a government department handling inland mail and ship letters, and it continued to be housed at the Casa del Commun Tesoro. The Chief Secretariat's Office took responsibility of the Post Office in 1815. Starting from 1819, the Island Post Office used various handstamps reading Malta P Paid, Malta Post Paid or Malta Post Office on mail."]}]}}
