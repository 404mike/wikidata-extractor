Richardson was followed by Elaine Padmore who at the time was also the Artistic Director of the Wexford Festival. When she departed in 1993 to become Artistic Director of the Royal Danish Opera, Dorothea Glatt took over. Glatt combined her post at DGOS with her ongoing work as the assistant to Wolfgang Wagner at the Bayreuth Festival. Her tenure was not a particularly successful one and in 1996 the company advertised once again for a new Artistic Director.
