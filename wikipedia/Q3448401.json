Curzon was commissioned by The Times to write several articles on the Persian political environment, but while there he decided to write a book on the country as whole. This two-volume work covers Persia's history and governmental structure, as well as graphics, maps and pictures (some taken by Curzon himself). Curzon was aided by General Albert Houtum-Schindler and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), both of which helped him gain access to material to which as a foreigner he would not have been entitled to have access. General Schindler provided Curzon with information regarding Persia's geography and resources, as well as serving as an unofficial editor.Wright, \"Curzon and Persia,\" pp 346\u20137"]}, {"page": "Imperial Bank of Persia", "response": ["The bank's high level contact in Tehran was general Albert Houtum-Schindler who was, like Reuter, a British subject of German origin.
