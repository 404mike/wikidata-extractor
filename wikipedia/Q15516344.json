Yeats was satisfied to find out that Blake's artistical and poetical ideas harmonized with those of the theosophists and the students and members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, for now he could use occult materials and claim the authority of a great poet for such beliefs and inspirations, in order to cultivate and imbue them into his own poetry. Blake, in short, bore, through his poetical and spiritual aspirations, amazing parallels to those of Yeats. Here was a sublime justifying precedent. Also, this set contains the first reproduced illustrations of Blake's Prophetic Books and is the first collection to publish Blake's Vala, or The Four Zoas. Yeats marked down William Blake as a master early on, and with Edwin Ellis produced a large-scale commentary on Blake's prophetic writings in 1893. While often erratic and idiosyncratic, it helped establish the importance of Blake's esoteric verse."]}]}}
