On 11 June 2018, Graham Potter was announced as the club's new manager, replacing Carvalhal. On 2 February 2019, Huw Jenkins resigned as chairman amid increasing criticism over the club's sale to the American consortium in 2016 and the club's subsequent relegation from the Premier League. He was replaced with Trevor Birch. The first season back in the Championship produced a 10th-place finish, including a quarter-final appearance in the FA Cup.

He said, \"I know the fanbase and what they expect in terms of the modern Swansea Way, that started under Roberto Mart\u00ednez and continued under Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup. We, as a coaching team, are very much aligned with that.
