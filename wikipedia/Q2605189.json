He let it be known that if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech, the British ambassador to the United States, that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as prime minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters."]}, {"page": "Oswestry", "response": ["* David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech (1918\u20131985) diplomat   HANSARD 1803\u20132005 \u2192 People (O), Mr William Ormsby-Gore retrieved 17 March 2018 and Conservative MP for Oswestry 1950 / 1961"]}, {"page": "Baron Harlech", "response": ["HTV, now known as ITV Wales, is an independent television company established by David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech, and the company was initially known as Harlech Television until 1970.

According to Hassinger, his wife Marie provided the inspiration for \"Mother's Little Helper\" when she supplied some downers in response to a request from one of the studio staff. Davis likens \"Lady Jane\" to a Tudor love song with lyrics apparently inspired by Henry VIII's love letters to Lady Jane Seymour. Some listeners assumed the song was about Jagger's high-society friend Jane Ormsby-Gore, daughter of David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech.
