Since only 11 to 30 cadets annually entered the College in those days, Lee would have instructed only about 140 cadets in his five years at the college (1893\u20131898), consisting of cadet numbers 320 to 457. Cadet No. 433, future Major General Thomas Victor Anderson, D.S.O., a future Chief of Staff of the Canadian Army, recalled that Lee was known around the Royal Military College as 'The Nipper', which the cadets christened him because he used to sing George Grossmith's songs with gusto. He enjoyed riding and walking in winter across the ice to Wolfe Island, and to town. He was a regular attendant at St. George's Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario) to hear the dean Buxton Smith. When Colonel Gerald Kitson, K.R.R.C., became RMC Commandant in 1897, Captain Lee came to live with the Kitsons in the Commandant's residence. In 1894, Lee initiated a Military Survey of the Canadian Frontier, and supervised its progress until its completion in 1896. During the summer of 1897 he was a Special Correspondent for the London Daily Chronicle, covering the earlier stages of the Klondike Gold Rush, based on his travels to Alaska and the Yukon. In 1900, when Lee resigned as British Military Attach\u00e9 in Washington, D.C., Colonel Kitson resigned as Commandant of RMC to take over the Washington post vacated by Lee."]}, {"page": "List of Cornish soldiers, commanders and sailors", "response": ["* Major General Sir Gerald Kitson, British Army officer "]}, {"page": "List of governors and commandants of Sandhurst", "response": ["*1902\u20131907: Major-General Gerald KitsonThe county families of the United Kingdom; or, Royal manual of the titled and untitled aristocracy of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland by Edward Walford, p.206"]}, {"page": "Gerald Charles Kitson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerald Kitson"]}]}}
