Founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because he thought it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. In 1920 the Church of England's Lambeth Conference condemned all \"unnatural means of conception avoidance\". The Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, complained of the huge number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays."]}, {"page": "Hanwell", "response": ["The church building is an imposing Gothic style building of the Edwardian period situated on a busy cross roads in the heart of Hanwell.

During 1913, the WSPU directly targeted the Bishop of Winchester, Edward Talbot; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson; the Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram; the Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, and the Bishops of Croydon, Lewes, Islington and Stepney. Each one was picketed by deputations at their official residences until granted an audience, during which the church leaders were asked to protest against forcible feeding. Norah Dacre Fox led many of the deputations on behalf of the WSPU, which were widely reported in The Suffragette.  At one point, the Bishop of London was persuaded to visit Holloway personally in connection with allegations of female prisoners being poisoned during force feeding. The Bishop made several visits to the prison, but this came to nothing, and his public statements said that he could find no evidence of ill treatment during force feeding \u2013 indeed, he believed that force feeding was carried out \"in the kindest possible spirit\" \u2013 was seen by the WSPU as collusion with the government and prison authorities. If the WSPU had been hoping to win support from the church for their wider cause by pressing on the issue of forcible feeding, they were disappointed. The church chose not to be drawn into a battle between the WSPU and the authorities, and maintained the party line that militancy was a precursor to forcible feeding and militancy was against the will of God, therefore the church could not act against forcible feeding."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Fisher", "response": ["In 1939 Arthur Winnington-Ingram, the long-serving Bishop of London, retired, aged 81. During his 38-year tenure the diocese was riven by factions and came close to disintegrating.Chandler and Hein, p. 25 It was clear that Winnington-Ingram's successor must be a man with a strong hand; Fisher was seen as one such, and Lang favoured his appointment. But although Fisher's record as an organiser and disciplinarian was well known, his theological views were not, and the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, sought reassurance from Lang that Fisher was doctrinally sound. The archbishop told Chamberlain that Fisher was \"undoubtedly a man of deep personal religion. His piety is that of the best type of English layman \u2026 he is very shy and humble about it (very English)\".Quoted in Chandler and Hein, p. 26 Chamberlain was reassured, and recommended to George VI that Fisher should succeed Winnington-Ingram.Chandler and Hein, p. 26 The King approved the appointment, but Fisher hesitated when offered it. He saw the great difficulties the turbulent diocese presented, and doubted his ability to unite it. After much private prayer, and reassurance from colleagues, he accepted and was enthroned as Bishop of London in St Paul's Cathedral in November 1939.Chandler and Hein, pp. 26\u201327\"Bishop of London Enthroned\", The Times, 4 November 1939, p. 3"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1901\u20131910)", "response": ["*Arthur Winnington-Ingram (1858\u20131946)"]}, {"page": "Anglican Church of Korea", "response": ["*1926\u20131930: Hugh Embling, Assistant Bishop in Corea.

In 1930 he wrote Slings and Arrows, which never made it to the West End because when his family, who were familiar with the play, attended the shows, they read out the lines of the characters in bored and dreary voices just before the actors themselves spoke.
