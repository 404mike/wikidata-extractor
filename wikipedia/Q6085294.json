It was released in 1981.", "Alan Blyth reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in October 1981, comparing it with recordings of the opera conducted by Riccardo ChaillyJules Massenet: Werther, cond. Riccardo Chailly, Deutsche Grammophon LP, 2709 091 and Michel PlassonJules Massenet: Werther, cond. Michel Plasson, EMI Records LP, SLS5183 He approved of most of Davis's principal soloists almost unreservedly. Robert Lloyd was a \"sonorous, flexible Bailiff\", \"idiomatic in French\". Isobel Buchanan's Sophie expressed the \"young girl's unspoilt views on life with forward, bright tone \u2013 just right\". Thomas Allen's Albert was \"ideal\", with enunciation as good as Lloyd's and \"controlled, velvet tone\", a figure as persuasive in his reverent devotion to his betrothed as in his paternalistic concern for his infatuated rival. As Werther, Jos\u00e9 Carreras sang with an Italianate timbre, prodigious breath control and meticulous attention to every nuance of Massenet's markings, and also gave a heartfelt performance as an actor. He was \"absolutely inside the role\" of the moody, reckless writer, \"rich and impassioned in 'O nature', properly distraught and urgent in 'J'aurais' [and] poetic in the Ossian stanzas\". His version of the character was clearly superior to Placido Domingo's vehement but broad-brush portrait for Chailly, and the pointed but reedy-voiced and sometimes self-indulgent performance given by Alfredo Kraus for Plasson. Frederica von Stade was not quite as impressive. She sang with sensitivity and with \"much feeling and tenderness\", and was vastly preferable to Chailly's Elena Obraztsova. But she had too few colours in her vocal paint-box and too little passion to supply what the role of Charlotte required. There was \"something a little precious and 'arty'\" about her reading. Plasson's Tatiana Troyanos used her words more eloquently and sang her music more affectingly. Colin Davis was a sensitive conductor, revealing the score's subtleties and its debts to Wagner and Berlioz, equally adept in the tranquil contentment of Act 1 and the melodrama of Act 3. The album's recording quality was good, with the balance of the voices and the orchestra well judged and skillful management of sound effects and off-stage voices. All in all, the set was a welcome one, and had obviously profited from the artists' experience of performing the opera together on stage. Whether readers would prefer it to Plasson's would depend on their opinions of Carreras vis \u00e0 vis Kraus and von Stade vis \u00e0 vis Troyanos.", "George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in March 1982. Frederica von Stade, he wrote, seemed untroubled by the technical challenges of Charlotte's music. She was \"an absolute pleasure to listen to, though a bit cool and distant for [his] taste \u2013 too much the proper, dutiful wife to make her agonizing dilemma fully believable\". As Charlotte's sister, Isobel Buchanan was \"a charming Sophie who [did] not overdo her girlishness\". Jos\u00e9 Carreras's Werther had both strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, \"the dark timbre of [Carreras's] attractive voice [helped] in creating a manly figure out of Goethe's at times annoyingly self-pitying hero\". On the negative side, Carreras's reading of \"O nature\" was laboured, and many of his higher notes were inelegant. Thomas Allen, by contrast, was excellent in every respect, with a timbre youthful enough to be apt for the young man that Albert was meant to be. The secondary roles were taken satisfactorily too, although the children's chorus could have sung more euphoniously. The orchestra played with \"passion and refinement\" under the \"strong hand\" of Colin Davis. A \"masterly orchestral colorist\", he managed Massenet's \"subtly sensuous orchestral idiom with a sure and sensitive command\". His tempi were not the sprightliest ever heard in Werther, but he gave the opera enough momentum to counterbalance its tendency towards a weepy misery, and his reading had certainly gained from the \"ensemble spirit\" that he had elicited when performing the work at Covent Garden. In sum, the album was a good one, if arguably not the equal of Georges Pr\u00eatre's more animated account with Nicolai Gedda and Victoria de los Angeles.Jules Massenet: Werther, cond. Georges Pr\u00eatre, Angel Records LP, S-3736 (The opera itself, although apparently becoming Massenet's most popular, was distinctly inferior to his Manon.)George Jellinek, Stereo Review, March 1982, p. 88", "Hilary Finch reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in February 1987. Her opinion of Frederica von Stade's Charlotte echoed Blyth's and Jellinek's. \"So far as style, line and inflection [were] concerned\", there was nothing in von Stade's performance that could be criticized. But her Charlotte was deficient dramatically. She had conveyed the young woman's \"essential simplicity of character\", but she had had less success in finding \"the shadows in the role\". She lacked the \"darker tinta\" that might have enabled her to \"bring a greater sense of the undercurrent of emotional conflict as it [grew] towards the last two acts\" of the opera. The album's other principals could be praised unequivocally. Jos\u00e9 Carreras was a dynamic Werther rather than a figure of introspective lyricism. Thomas Allen gave Albert a richness of inner life that it was unusual to encounter in the role. And Isobel Buchanan provided a \"small-scale, straightforward Sophie, a real oiseau d'aurore ready to fly away into the emotion of each changing moment\". The Covent Garden orchestra played as well as they knew how, \"the solo detail and the velocity of their every response to Massenet's flickering orchestral palette [operating] as if with heightened awareness under the scrutiny of the laser beam\". Colin Davis's conducting paced the opera \"superbly\", heightening and relaxing the tension of its words and music so that its drama was compulsively engrossing from its first bar to its last.Hilary Finch, Gramophone, February 1987, pp. 1177\u20131178", "* Isobel Buchanan (soprano), Sophie, Charlotte's sister, aged 15"]}, {"page": "Isobel Wilson Buchanan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Isobel Buchanan"]}]}}
