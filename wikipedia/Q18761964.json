This initial work was largely limited to the area around Carleton Road. In 1865 the scheme was taken up by George Truefitt who developed most of the local villas and St. George's Church (1865), built for Anglican secessionists.  The housing stock was of a solid nature, and Tufnell Park kept its good name until the end of the century.  Charles Booth in his survey of London Life and Labour reported that the older streets (Anson Road and Carleton Road) housed a mixture of retired merchants and music hall artistes who were rich enough to holiday abroad over winter.  He believed that second wave of building around Celia, Hugo, Corinne, Huddleston and Archibald Roads threatened to create a metropolis \"from which the rich would soon be going\". The private girls' school established at the corner of Carleton and Brecknock Roads ceased in 1878 after many of its pupils drowned in the  disaster."]}, {"page": "Calvert Vaux", "response": ["Born in London to a physician, Vaux was baptized at St Benet Gracechurch on February 9, 1825.

The spectacular woodwork inside the building dates from the 15th century and is notable for the very rare chancel screen which extends into a squire's pew.Photo at Geograph Also to be found there is a circular Norman font, a floor of mediaeval tiles and the 1596 wooden tomb of Francis Walsh and his wife, carved to resemble stone.Photo at Geograph\"Church of St Andrew\" at Historic England  What Nicholas Pevsner described as a \"distinctively quirky restoration\" was made by George Truefitt in 1859, which resulted in the exterior addition of the pyramid-roofed wooden bell-turret and a north porch.
