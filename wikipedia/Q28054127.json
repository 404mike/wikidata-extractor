Her specialism was to apply the arts and eurythmy to the treatment of pre-school child patients, inspired by the work of the Austrian anthroposophist, Rudolf Steiner. Early in her career she attracted criticism through association with her senior colleague, the controversial psychiatrist William Sargant, whom she followed for a time in the application of sleep therapy and antidepressant prescription to children.\nAs a child, she became part of the Jewish exodus fleeing from persecution in Nazi Germany. Frommer was a great promoter of the arts for children and was modestly a philanthropist.", "link_mentions": {}}}
