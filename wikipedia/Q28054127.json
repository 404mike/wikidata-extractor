Her specialism was to apply the arts and eurythmy to the treatment of pre-school child patients, inspired by the work of the Austrian anthroposophist, Rudolf Steiner. Early in her career she attracted criticism through association with her senior colleague, the controversial psychiatrist William Sargant, whom she followed for a time in the application of sleep therapy and antidepressant prescription to children.\nAs a child, she became part of the Jewish exodus fleeing from persecution in Nazi Germany. Frommer was a great promoter of the arts for children and was modestly a philanthropist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anthroposophy", "response": ["Anthroposophy's supporters include Hilma af Klint, Pulitzer Prize-winning and Nobel Laureate Saul Bellow, Nobel prize winner Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, Andrei Bely, Joseph Beuys, Owen Barfield, architect Walter Burley Griffin, Wassily Kandinsky, Andrei Tarkovsky, Bruno Walter, Right Livelihood Award winners Sir George Trevelyan, and Ibrahim Abouleish, child psychiatrist Eva Frommer, Fortune editor Russell Davenport, pianist and composer David Tudor, Romuva (Lithuanian pagan) religious founder Vyd\u016bnas, and former president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia.

It was a decade during which child psychiatry witnessed a major evolution as a result of the work carried out by, Eva Frommer, Douglas Haldane, Michael Rutter, Robin Skynner and Sula Wolff, among others.;  The first comprehensive population survey of 9- to 11-year-olds, carried out in London and the Isle of Wight, which appeared in 1970, addressed questions that have continued to be of importance for child psychiatry; for example, rates of psychiatric disorders, the role of intellectual development and physical impairment, and specific concern for potential social influences on children's adjustment. This work was influential, especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time, and the influence of social and contextual factors in children's mental health, in their subsequent re-evaluation of the original cohort of children. These studies described the prevalence of ADHD (relatively low as compared to the US), identified the onset and prevalence of depression in mid-adolescence and the frequent co-morbidity with conduct disorder, and explored the relationship between various mental disorders and scholastic achievement."]}, {"page": "Michael Hall (school)", "response": ["*Eva Frommer \u2013 pioneering child psychiatrist, writer, translator and sponsor of Steiner publications"]}, {"page": "Children's Day Hospital", "response": ["In 1965, with the arrival at St Thomas' Hospital of innovative consultant child psychiatrist, Dr. Eva Frommer, the children's hospital was renamed again, this time as the 'Psychiatric Day Hospital for Children and their Families' and provided full-time out-patient treatment to primary-age children referred to the Department of Child Psychiatry at St. Thomas'.
