The county side were crushed by an innings and 165 runs, but Brook took four good wickets: those of Woodfull, Jackson, Bradman and McCabe.\nBrook kept his place in the Worcestershire side throughout the remainder of the 1930 season, and produced a number of excellent performances: 6-80 against Nottinghamshire in early June was followed by 5-40 and 7-50 (his career best) versus Leicestershire a fortnight later. Indeed, he claimed five wickets in an innings on 12 occasions in total that summer, finishing with a fine season's return of 132 first-class wickets at 21.88 to top Worcestershire's bowling averages ahead of Fred Root.\nFrom 1931 to 1934, Brook was a regular in the Worcestershire side, but he could never quite recapture his outstanding form of 1930: in those four years he took 81, 71, 82 and 87 wickets, with a total of 11 five-wicket hauls \u2014 one fewer than he had managed in a single season in his first summer at the county. His bowling average varied considerably, from an acceptable 24.34 in 1931 to an expensive 37.56 two years later. With the bat Brook was nothing special, but he did manage two half-centuries in 1932 and another (a career-best 56 in a high-scoring draw against Gloucestershire) in 1933.\nHe played only three more games for Worcestershire, in May 1935, his final wicket being that of Yorkshire's Arthur Mitchell. He then left the first-class arena for good to play for Keighley.\nBrook was born in Mirfield, Yorkshire; he died in Bournemouth at the age of 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brook (surname)", "response": ["*George Brook (cricketer) (1888\u20131966), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "George Brooke", "response": ["George Brooke may refer to:", "*George Brook (cricketer) (1888\u20131966), English cricketer", "*George Brooke (conspirator) (1568\u20131603), son of 10th Baron Cobham; conspirator against James VI of Scotland and I of England", "*George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham (1497\u20131558), English nobleman", "*George Brooke (MP) for Eye", "*George Brooke alias Cobham, MP for Portsmouth", "*George Brooks (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 1966", "response": ["* George Brook, English cricketer (b. 1888)"]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Worcestershire chose not to compete in the chaotic 1919 season. Like Northants, they were perennial strugglers and picked up five wooden spoons. There was an improvement in 1939 when they won more than they lost for once and finished seventh. Their best batsmen were Harold Gibbons, Maurice Nichol and Cyril Walters. The Nawab of Pataudi was on their books in the 1930s but he only played one full season for them, 1933, when he scored 1,749 runs. Fred Root was the mainstay of the Worcestershire bowling through the 1920s when they also had the all-rounder Frederick Pearson. In the 1930s, Worcestershire's best bowlers were George Brook, Dick Howorth, Peter Jackson, Reg Perks and Sidney Martin. Syd Buller, later well known as a Test umpire, kept wicket for Worcestershire in the 1930s."]}]}}
