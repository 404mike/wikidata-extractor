He currently manages the Antrim county team.\nMcGinley was part of Tyrone's All-Ireland-winning teams of 2003, 2005 and 2008.

The county played a total of ten matches, including three replays, which was a record for any winning team. Tyrone played five matches in the Ulster SFC, including replays against Cavan in the semi-final and against Armagh in the final, which they lost. Having to contest an All-Ireland SFC qualifier as a result of that loss, Tyrone overcame Monaghan to reach an All-Ireland SFC quarter-final against Dublin. Tyrone had yet another drawn game, a match memorable for Owen Mulligan's solo goal. Harte combined Enda McGinley with Joe McMahon for the second half of that game, a move which outwitted Ciar\u00e1n Whelan, who had been getting the better of his opponents in the first half; Whelan was ultimately removed from the game by the Dublin management. In the All-Ireland SFC semi-final, the county met Armagh for a third time; two points behind with only six minutes of play left and, in what Eamonn Sweeney writing later in the Sunday Independent called \"the defining moment of Harte's team\", Se\u00e1n Cavanagh scored a solo point, substitute Shane Sweeney levelled the game and Canavan converted an injury-time free. In the 2005 All-Ireland SFC final, the county defeated Kerry for the second time in three years to win the Sam Maguire Cup."]}, {"page": "Stephen O'Neill", "response": ["O'Neill was brought in as part of the backroom team of his former Tyrone teammate Enda McGinley when McGinley took over as Antrim manager."]}, {"page": "List of All Stars Awards winners (football)", "response": ["| MD || 20px|border Enda McGinley || Tyrone || 1"]}, {"page": "Ulster Senior Football Championship", "response": ["|Enda McGinley"]}, {"page": "Shane Ryan (Gaelic footballer)", "response": ["In 2006, Ryan won the Sigerson Cup with Dublin City University and was nominated for an All Star award for his performances with Dublin in Midfield. 2006 continued to be a good year for Ryan as Se\u00e1n Boylan named him on the Compromise Rules squad to play Australia in the first test at Pearse Stadium on 29 October 2006.
