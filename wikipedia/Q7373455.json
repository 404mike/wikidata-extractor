He reappeared in 1963 after National Service and was a regular in the Somerset side for the rest of the 1960s, usually scoring his 1,000 runs a season, but only once averaging more than 30 runs an innings. \nBut then, suddenly, in 1970, Virgin's batting moved into a different league. Revealing a wider range of shots than before, he scored fast and prolifically, with 2,223 runs at an average of 47 in the season, including seven centuries. He was talked of as a possible England opener and was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1971 edition of the almanack. The 1971 season was another successful year for Virgin, but in 1972 his runmaking fell away badly, and he left Somerset at the end of the season. \nThe parting was not amicable. Virgin had to wait half a season before he could make his County Championship debut in 1973 for Northamptonshire and then he had limited success. But in 1974, he had a second season of high achievement: 1,936 runs at an average of almost 57 runs per innings meant that he was fifth in the national averages. Again, he was talked of as a potential England player; but again he was not selected. \nVirgin was appointed captain of Northamptonshire in 1975, but resigned in August, saying that the captaincy was affecting his batting. He barely made his 1,000 runs that season, but recovered to average 34 in the 1976 season. Batting with Peter Willey he scored 145 in a fourth wicket stand of 370 against Somerset at Northampton, which remains the county record for a fourth wicket partnership. But after a less successful season in 1977 he retired to take up a business appointment.\nEarly in his career, Virgin occasionally acted as wicketkeeper in first-class matches, and he continued to do so occasionally in one-day matches throughout his career. More often, he was a reliable catcher in the slips and his 42 catches for Somerset in 1966 remains the county record.\nVirgin married Margaret Ann Thresher in 1960 and had three children (Steve, Dave and Andy) and five grandchildren (Heather, Hayley, Matt, Arran and Olivia). He has two brothers and two sisters. (Brian, Sid, Maureen and Helen).\nIn December 2019 Roy became a Great-Grandfather to Frederick Roy Virgin who is Matt + Beth's son. Frederick's middle name was indeed named after Roy himself.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Roy Virgin"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Roy Virgin"]}, {"page": "Virgin (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Roy Virgin (born 1939), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "1970 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden - Jack Bond, Clive Lloyd, Brian Luckhurst, Glenn Turner, Roy Virgin", " || Roy Virgin || 47 || 2223 || 178 || 47.29 || 7 "]}, {"page": "1974 English cricket season", "response": [" || Roy Virgin || 39 || 1936 || 144* || 56.94 || 7", " || Roy Virgin || 39 || 1936 || 144* || 56.94 || 7 "]}, {"page": "Indian cricket team in England in 1971", "response": ["Tom Pearce's XI put up 357 for 3 on the first day.

In this 1960 season, he made his highest first-class score, 190 against Glamorgan at Bath, when he also put on 300 for the third wicket with Peter Wight, then a Somerset county record.

In an unsuccessful season for Somerset \u2013 the county finished bottom of the Championship table for the first time since 1955 \u2013 Carter was singled out for praise in Wisden.

He appeared less frequently in one-day cricket: the 1969 season was the first season of the new John Player League, a 40-over competition played on Sundays, but Carter played in only a few matches, Somerset generally preferring the more reliable batting of Roy Virgin, who could keep wicket adequately."]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Roy Virgin (1973\u20131977) : R.

At the subsequent Extraordinary General meeting, held just before Christmas, Watts took his place on the platform to face the members, some of whom had formed themselves into an Action Group to demand, at the very least, a full explanation of all the behind-the-scenes machinations. The next two summers saw his Northamptonshire team reach the Gillette Cup final, win the Benson & Hedges Cup (with Watts' tactical acumen seen to best advantage in an absorbing semi-final struggle against Mike Brearley's Middlesex at Lord's), and drag itself off the bottom of the Championship table."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Roy Virgin", "|align=left|Roy Virgin", "|align=left|Roy Virgin", "|align=left|Roy Virgin", "|align=left|Roy Virgin", "|align=left|Roy Virgin", "|align=left|Roy Virgin", "|align=left|Roy Virgin"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 15458 || Roy Virgin", "| 301 || Roy Virgin"]}, {"page": "Steve Wilkinson (cricketer)", "response": ["Wilkinson played as a right-handed opening or middle-order batsman.

Mervyn Kitchen and Graham Burgess each batted well to propel Somerset to a score of 251 for nine. Leicestershire were then bowled out for 160 runs after just 46.3 overs, giving Somerset a 91-run victory. Somerset's second round match against Warwickshire, in Birmingham, took three days to complete. Somerset batted first again, and scored 206 for eight. No batsmen particularly stood out; Roy Virgin, Bill Alley and Colin Atkinson all made scores in the forties, while Kitchen scored 35, and no other batsman reached double figures. Warwickshire then reached 84 for four just short of halfway through their overs when the game was postponed due to inclement weather. Cricket at the time was not played on Sundays, and no further play was possible on Monday, so the game continued on Tuesday, when economical bowling from Fred Rumsey, along with the wickets taken by Alley on the first day, helped to restrict Warwickshire to 181 runs. Somerset batted first again in their quarter final match against Northamptonshire, but only managed to score 184 runs. No Somerset player managed to score more than 40 runs during the innings. The Somerset bowlers played well in comparison; Rumsey took four wickets, while Alley conceded only eight runs from his twelve overs, and Northamptonshire were bowled out for 148. Somerset once again had no stand-out batting performance in their semi-final; Kitchen was their highest scorer with 40 runs, as they posted 210 for seven in a rain-interrupted innings which continued into the second day of the match. Three of the Somerset bowlers, Ken Palmer, Rumsey and Alley all conceded less than two runs per over to help their side limit Lancashire to 110 runs, and give Somerset a 100-run victory.", "In Somerset's batting innings, Woodcock suggested that the team needed just one top-class performance to grant them victory after restricting Kent's score well late in their innings. Peter Robinson, opening with Roy Virgin, played well to score 48 runs, but that was the highest score that any Somerset player would manage. Each of the other top-order batsmen made starts, but none could convert them to big scores; Virgin got 17, Mervyn Kitchen 15 and Terry Barwell 24. Alley, identified by The Times as a key player for Somerset before the match, only scored one run before being caught behind square on the legside by Brown from the bowling of Shepherd. Graham Burgess provided some runs in the middle-order, but lacked support from his batting partners; of the five batsmen who were below him in the batting order, only Geoff Clayton added more than two runs to the score, and he only totalled eight. Derek Underwood finished as Kent's leading wicket-taker in the match, though his three wickets came late in the innings, as he had been held back against the top-order, as Cowdrey was concerned he might concede too many runs. Somerset were all out for 161 runs, with 54.5 overs bowled, giving Kent a 32-run victory.", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Roy Virgin b Fred Rumsey || 30", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Roy Virgin "]}]}}
