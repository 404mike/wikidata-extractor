As he was unable to regain a commission in the RAF or work for British Intelligence due to his criminal past, Dicketts volunteered to work for the British Double Cross team.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Double-Cross System", "response": ["Control of the new double agents fell to Thomas Argyll Robertson (usually called Tar, from his initials), a charismatic MI5 agent. A Scot and something of a playboy, Robertson had some early experience with double agents; just prior to the war he had been case officer to Arthur Owens (code name Snow). Owens was an oddity and it became apparent that he was playing off the Germans and British, although to what end Robertson was unable to uncover. Robertson dispatched an ex-RNAS officer called Walter Dicketts (code name Celery) to neutral Lisbon in early 1941 pg 108 to meet Owens' German spymaster, Nikolaus Ritter from the Abwehr, to establish Owens' bona fides. Unknown to Dicketts, Owens had betrayed him to the Germans before Dicketts entered Germany to be interrogated by experts from the Abwehr in Hamburg. pp. 181-186 Although Dicketts managed to get himself recruited as a German agent (while continuing to report to MI5), Owens claimed that Dicketts' survival meant he had been 'turned' by the Germans. When both agents returned to England, Robertson and his team spent countless hours trying to establish which agent was telling the truth. In the end Owens was interned for endangering Dicketts' life and for revealing the important information that his German radio transmitter was controlled by MI5. The whole affair resulted in the collapse of the entire Snow network comprising the double agents Owens, GW, Biscuit, Charlie, Summer and Celery. The experiment had not appeared to be a success but MI5 had learned lessons about how Abwehr operated and how double agents might be useful.", "* Celery \u2013 Walter Dicketts"]}, {"page": "Double agent", "response": ["!Walter Dicketts \"Celery\""]}, {"page": "Arthur Owens", "response": ["In February 1941, Owens was permitted to fly to Portugal to meet Ritter, accompanied by Walter Dicketts, an ex RNAS officer who had worked in Air Intelligence pp.7, 11 & 115 during the previous war and had since served several prison sentences for fraud. Unable to trust Owens, MI5 had instructed Dicketts to verify Owens\u2019 bona fides and get himself infiltrated into Owens\u2019 network, where he could be run as a separate, and if necessary, alternate source of information. Dicketts was instructed by Tar Robertson, head of the double agent section in MI5, to take his WW1 Staff Appointment with the Air Ministry to prove his value to the Germans, and to try and get himself taken into Germany for training. Ritter invited Dicketts to come to Hamburg for interrogation by experts from the Abwehr, which Dicketts accepted and was escorted through Spain and France into Germany. Ritter refused to allow Owens to accompany Dicketts and he was forced to remain behind in Lisbon. Using material provided to him by MI5, Dicketts managed to convince the Germans he was a traitor willing to sell out his country for cash and to help end the war and was accepted as a German agent. pp. 135-136, & 144 Ritter instructed Dicketts to purchase a boat when he returned to England, so he could ferry German spies and sabotage equipment from the Nazi occupied Channel Islands into England.

On one occasion, MI5 sent a second double-agent, Sam McCarthy (code name: BISCUIT), with Owens to rendezvous with Ritter in the North Sea. The mission was aborted by McCarthy who became convinced Owens was a genuine Nazi spy, who would immediately betray his identity as a British spy to Ritter as soon as he arrived by submarine or seaplane. Owens' downfall came after MI5 sent him on a mission to Lisbon in early 1941 to introduce their latest plant, an ex RNAS officer come confidence trickster, called Walter Dicketts, who worked in intelligence for the Air Ministry  during World War I, to meet Ritter and get himself recruited as a German spy. Given the codename CELERY, Dicketts managed to outwit his interrogators in Hamburg and Berlin and return to Britain as, in the Abwehr's eyes, a German spy with the codename JACK BROWN.  When both men returned to Britain their stories didn't match and MI5 spent countless hours trying to establish who was telling the truth. In the end Dicketts' testimony was believed over Owens, who was imprisoned for the remainder of the war for betraying Dicketts and for informing Ritter that his German radio set was under the control of MI5. Dicketts was sent back to Lisbon in June to help Ritter's assistant, George Seller to defect to Britain in return for being allowed to rejoin his relatives in the USA. Ritter continued to believe Owens was always his spy until his death, and that he had been betrayed by Dicketts. MI5 believed Owens was primarily interested in making money from both sides and that neither side trusted him entirely. After the war Owens moved to Ireland, disappeared into obscurity, and died in 1957."]}]}}
