She had left another suffrage organisation \u2013 the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) \u2013 as she considered the leadership too autocratic. In 1904, she was appointed by the WSPU as a travelling speaker for the organisation. On 25 April 1906, she unveiled a 'Votes for Women' banner from the Ladies Gallery during the debate in the House of Commons. In June 1906, she was arrested in a fracas outside of Chancellor of the Exchequer H. H. Asquith's home, and as a result was the first suffragette to be incarcerated in Holloway Prison.\nShe founded the Women's Billiards Association in 1931. Her publications include The Militant Suffrage Movement (1911), which contained criticism of suffragettes' tactics, and The Consumer in Revolt (1912), which explored links between consumerism and feminism. Her archives are held at the Women's Library at the London School of Economics.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Emmeline Pankhurst", "response": ["As the WSPU gained recognition and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 a small group of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League.Bartley, pp. 91\u201393; Purvis 2002, pp. 96\u201399; Pugh, pp. 165\u2013168. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting\u00a0... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.E.

In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the Adult Suffrage Society (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property. In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by Sir Charles Dilke.Abrams, pp. 225\u201326 This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was \"talked out\" in the House of Commons, but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, in the course of a public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification.Holton, pp. 57\u201358 She wished good luck to those fighting for a \"same terms as men\" suffrage bill, but \"don't let them come and tell me that they are working for my class\".Bondfield, p. 83 The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000.Hamilton, p. 61 Her departure, she said, was \"alike a grief and a deliverance\".Bondfield, p. 60 After the passing of the Representation of the People's Act 1918, giving some women the vote, Bondfield's answer to 'Are Women MPs necessary?\" was \u2018We shall never reach a satisfactory State until we have the recognition of the citizen irrespective of sex.\u2019"]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1875\u20131939||data-sort-value=\"Billington-Greig, Teresa\"|Teresa Billington-Greig||United Kingdom ||1877||1964||Suffragette||"]}, {"page": "Women's Social and Political Union", "response": ["* Teresa Billington-Greig"]}, {"page": "Dora Marsden", "response": ["Dora Marsden was born on 5 March 1882 to working-class parents, Fred and Hannah, in Marsden, Yorkshire.

She proved a successful student, working as a tutor at the age of thirteen before receiving a Queen's Scholarship at the age of eighteen, which enabled her to attend Owens College in Manchester (later the Victoria University of Manchester). In 1903, Marsden graduated from college and taught school for several years, eventually becoming headmistress of the Altrincham Teacher-Pupil Center in 1908. During her time at Owens College, Marsden made the acquaintance of Christabel Pankhurst, Teresa Billington-Greig, and other prominent early feminists, and she became involved with the women's suffrage movement then gathering steam in Manchester. Marsden established a reputation with the militant wing of the movement for fierce devotion to the cause, leading one contemporary to call her \"a brave and beautiful spirit,\" a phrase to which the title of Les Garner's biography of Marsden refers. This devotion extended to extra-legal acts of sabotage on more than one occasion.
