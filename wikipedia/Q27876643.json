Holst dedicated the piece \"for Gregynog\" on the manuscript score of the piece. Holst had originally intended it to be dedicated to Dora Herbert Jones, but she attempted to persuade him to dedicate it to the Gregynog Choir. The piece was written in the last year of Holst's life. Alan Gibbs, writing in Holst Among Friends, speculates that the themes of the poem may have appealed to Holst due to his growing physical weakness. The first public performance of the piece was given by the Gregynog Choir in 1938."]}]}}
