A. McClaskey. His mother was the former Ida Connors and he was the youngest of four children.Doug Dougherty, St. Stephen - Yesteryear, n. d. (ca 2000), St Stephen: Parsons Publishing company. His vocal talents were recognized early and by the age of 5 he was performing publicly in St. Stephen. At age 10 he was the mascot for the Saint John Bicycle and Athletic Club in the nearby city of Saint John, singing \"Her Eyes Don't Shine Like Diamonds\" and at age 13 he was performing onstage as a boy tenor with the Artillery Band in Saint John. The family had moved to Saint John by this time. Perhaps doubting that he could make a career in music, he later attended Mt. Allison Academy in Sackville, New Brunswick, and afterwards worked for his father. On April 14, 1901, he appeared at the opera house in Saint John in his first notable concert with the Scottish soprano Jessie MacLachlan. On September 30, 1901 he was discovered by the Metropolitan Opera baritone Giuseppe Campanari who was in Saint John to perform at the St. John Opera House. Campanari insisted that McClaskey go to New York for musical training."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Jessie MacLachlan (1866\u20131916), Gaelic soprano"]}, {"page": "Jessie maclachlan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan "]}, {"page": "Jessie N MacLachlan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "Jessie Niven Maclachlan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "Seonaid nic lachlainn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "Jessie n mclachlan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "Jessie niven mclachlan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "Jessie n maclachlan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "Se\u00f2naid Nic Lachlainn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Gaelic-speaking people", "response": ["* Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "Seonaid Nic Lachlainn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jessie MacLachlan "]}, {"page": "Bonnie Charlie", "response": ["*Jessie MacLachlan"]}, {"page": "Colin McAlpin", "response": ["* Our Heroe's welcome (Alice C.
