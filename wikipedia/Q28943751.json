She was a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and worked for Communist International (Comintern) from 1920 to 1929. Between 1931 and 1937, Cohen served as a foreign editor of The Moscow News. She was executed during the Great Purge in the Soviet Union, and posthumously rehabilitated in the Soviet Union in 1956.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Pollitt", "response": ["thumb|right|Rose Cohen, a CPGB member and friend of Pollitt, executed during the Great Purge", "When Pollitt's personal friend Rose Cohen, to whom he had proposed marriage on a number of occasions, was put on trial in Moscow in 1937 during Stalin's Great Purge, CPGB opposed efforts by the British government to get Cohen released, describing her arrest as an internal affair of the Soviet Union. Pollitt privately tried to intervene on her behalf, but by the time he did so she had already been shot. Pollitt placed himself at risk by questioning Cohen's arrest in this fashion, as Bela Kun had, under torture, identified him as a \"Trotskyist\" and \"British spy\", though Osip Piatnitsky had refused to confirm these accusations when arrested by the NKVD in 1937. 20 years after Cohen's death, Pollitt requested information from Moscow about whether she was still alive, stating, untruthfully, that there was press interest in Britain about her whereabouts.", "In contrast to Pollitt's concern over Rose Cohen, when CPGB member Freda Utley tried to get Pollitt to intercede with Moscow on behalf of her Russian husband, who was arrested and died in a labour camp in 1938, Pollitt refused. Pollitt also failed to intervene to help George Fles and his wife, Arcadi Berdichevsky and his wife, nor a number of other British communists who were arrested by the NKVD and tortured, shot, or imprisoned in the Gulag during Stalin's purge."]}, {"page": "Rose Cohen (feminist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rose Cohen (communist)"]}]}}
