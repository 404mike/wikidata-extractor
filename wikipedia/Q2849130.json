However, Mafi's home debut in Thomond Park, in the trouncing of French outfit Bourgoin, was more impressive. Sprung from the bench with 10 minutes to go, a scintillating break and hand-off resulted in a try for substitute hooker Andy Kyriacou."]}, {"page": "West Park St Helens", "response": ["In the 2000/2001 season, the team played against Vale of Lune, Broughton Park, Widnes, Winnington Park, Lymm, Blackburn and Aldwinians in the newly formed North 2 (West) league.
