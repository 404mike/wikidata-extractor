The following month it was relaunched as West Ham United. The club's nickname is The Hammers, owing to their Ironworks origins. In the 1901\u201302 and 1902\u201303 seasons, Millwall and West Ham competed in the Southern League, London League, Western League and Southern Professional Charity Cup. The two sides met seven times in each of these seasons, the highest number of meetings in a season between the clubs.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 268 During this period Millwall were unbeaten in 12 consecutive games against West Ham, with nine wins and three draws over two years. This included a 7\u20131 win in a Southern Professional Charity Cup semi-final on 2 April 1903, the largest winning margin between the teams. Ben Hulse scored four of the goals at the Memorial Grounds.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 166 The run was finally broken on 1 September 1904, in a 3\u20130 victory at West Ham's first ever game at Upton Park, with two goals from Billy Bridgeman and one by Jack Flynn. Upton Park was in Essex until 1965, and technically West Ham was not a London team again until an act of Parliament changed the boundary lines of London in 1965 and the Borough of Newham was formed."]}, {"page": "John Blackwood (footballer, born 1877)", "response": ["He joined fellow Southern League First Division club West Ham United in December 1904. Taking over centre forward duties from Billy Bridgeman, he scored on his debut, against Portsmouth on 26 December, but his four-match run in the team coincided with one of the club's worst ever losing streaks. He played the last of his games for West Ham on 7 January 1905, against his old club QPR, after which Bridgeman was recalled to the team. After leaving the Irons, he returned to Scotland, joining Royal Albert on 2 September 1905."]}]}}
