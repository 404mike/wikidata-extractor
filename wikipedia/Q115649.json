Born Paul Harry Ferdinando in Bethnal Green, England on 11 November 1867, he moved in 1895 from London to Paris where he published and sold books in the rue Faubourg Montmartre and rue de Chateaudun; for a short period he moved his activities to Brussels. Carrington also published works of classical literature, including the first English translation of Aristophanes' \"Comedies,\" and books by famous authors such as Oscar Wilde and Anatole France, in order to hide his \"undercover\" erotica publications under a veil of legitimacy.  His books featured the erotic art of Martin van Ma\u00eble.  He published a French series La Flagellation a Travers le Monde mainly on English flagellation, identifying it as an English predilection.Carrington went blind as a result of syphilis and the last few years of his life were spent in poverty as his mistress stole his valuable collection of rare books.  He was placed in a lunatic asylum and died in 1921 at Ivry-sur-Seine, France.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "response": ["Though not initially a widely appreciated component of Wilde's body of work following his death in 1900, The Picture of Dorian Gray has come to attract a great deal of academic and popular interest, and has been the subject of many adaptations to film and stage. Because of its association with Wilde's trials, the novel initially suffered from a low reputation. In the decade after Wilde's death, the authorized edition of the novel was published by Charles Carrington, who specialized in literary erotica. In 1913, it was adapted to the stage by writer G. Constant Lounsbery at London's Vaudeville Theatre. In the same decade, it was the subject of several silent film adaptations. Perhaps the best-known and most critically praised film adaptation is 1945's The Picture of Dorian Gray, which earned an Academy Award for best black-and-white cinematography, as well as a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Angela Lansbury, who played Sibyl Vane."]}, {"page": "Satyricon", "response": ["* Paris, 1902.

The 1902 translation made free use of Addison's 1736 translation, but mistakenly attributes it to Joseph Addison, the better known author and statesman who died in 1719. The bibliography is disappointing in both range and accuracy. The underlying text is very bad and turns of phrase suggest that the translation was more likely from French renderings than directly from the original Latin. Despite the publisher's slip of paper ascribing it to Oscar Wilde, the style is not good enough and Carrington could not, when challenged, produce any of the manuscript.

Smithers and Nichols were aligned with William Lazenby, Edward Avery, and Charles Carrington, in a small and tightly interwoven group of late Victorian publishers heavily involved in the production and distribution of pornography in London and Paris.  Smithers worked extensively in the 1890s with Wilde and his circle, as is indicated by the title of James Nelson's book on Smithers, Publisher to the Decadents. Lisa Sigel claims that unlike most pornographers, who were eager to preserve their anonymity for reasons of respectability and safety, Smithers \"embrace[d] public scrutiny\" and managed to earn some renown for encouraging and orchestrating the collaboration of Wilde and Beardsley on Salom\u00e9.Sigel, Lisa, Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815-1914.

Teleny was published 1893 as part of this series in a limited edition of 200 copies, with significant edits by Smithers, including the omission of an introduction and a change in the setting from London to Paris.  Smithers promoted it in an advertisement, sent to a select group of subscribers, as \"undoubtedly, the most powerful and most cleverly written erotic Romance which has appeared in the English language during recent years,\" authored by \"a man of great imagination\u2026[who] has conceived a thrilling story.\" And: \"It is a most extraordinary story of passion, and while dealing with scenes which surpass in freedom the wildest license, the culture of its author\u2019s style adds an additional piquancy and spice to the narration\".
