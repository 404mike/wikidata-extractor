One of the most pressing concerns in the work was the attempt to transform existing class relationships in an educational context; Tawney wished to see the elimination of the \"vulgar irrelevancies of class inequality\". It was written only a few years after the passage of the Education Act (1918) which had been engaged with by Tawney in his role as a key member of the Labour party's educational committee (alongside other figures such as Percy Nunn). Tawney's work was based on abstract and ideological considerations but also empirical case studies such as the extension of secondary education in Bradford and Birmingham."]}, {"page": "Nuffield Science Project", "response": ["Organisers were charged simply with creating \"a coordinated set of materials, for use by teachers in any way they saw fit.\"Waring, p. 13.

Ingle in the early 1970s with a view to revising the chemistry materials, many chemistry teachers did not have time to read the handbook and simply used the Sample Scheme, an example of how to construct a course; Waring, p.\u00a0214. Particularly for physics, kits of apparatus for class experiments were developed in association with manufacturers; government money was readily available at the start of the project for schools to purchase equipment and improve their laboratories.Woolnough, pp. 165\u201367.Jim Jardine, \"Apparatus for the Inquiring Mind\", in Jennison and Ogborn, eds., Wonder and Delight, pp.\u00a0169\u201380, on development and testing of physics apparatus under Eric Rogers.

Their school was located at Cartwright Gardens in St Pancras and mainly catered to the children of women working in a nearby matchbox factory. An admirer of Randolph Caldecott's children's book illustrations, Rendel named the nursery school in his honour and adorned its walls with a frieze of his pictures. Rendel's grandfather, Alexander Meadows Rendel, provided them with an endowment and further donations were received from her large circle of family and friends. By 1914 the school was well-established with a written constitution and Percy Nunn as its chairman. Princess Louise served as its president."]}]}}
