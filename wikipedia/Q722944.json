Stilwell has appeared as a pet behavior expert and served as a producer on several international TV series including Dogs Might Fly (Sky TV), Dogs With Extraordinary Jobs (Smithsonian Channel), and Greatest American Dog (CBS), and is best known as the star and creator of the dog training TV show It's Me or the Dog. She is a leading proponent of positive reinforcement-based dog training tools and methods to provide pet behavior advice instead of traditional methods which typically employ multiple approaches including the use of pain, fear and intimidation. She is the Editor-In-Chief of the Positively.com website, the founder and president of the Victoria Stilwell Academy for Dog Training & Behavior, the CEO of the Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training (VSPDT) network of dog trainers, and other dog behavior institutions.

The show currently airs in about 50 countries worldwide.", "British born Victoria Stilwell was an actor who had built her sideline interest in dog training into a full-time business when she saw the first episode of Supernanny and realised that what she was doing with dogs was similar to what Jo Frost was doing with children. She contacted the producers of Super Nanny, British reality-show producers Ricochet Television, who responded immediately, and production began on It's Me or the Dog. Stilwell said her motivation was to \"highlight positive training because there are so many dominance trainers out there messing it all up\". Stilwell acknowledges that training a dog on television is not the same as training without the cameras and crew.", "In June 2021, it was announced on Victoria Stilwell's Facebook page and on the It's Me or the Dog YouTube channel, that a fifth series of It's Me or the Dog (UK) had been commissioned and they were looking for applicants.

Victoria Stilwell felt that Teresa's use of \"snarl bands\" (an elastic band meant to keep the dog's lips raised) on Leroy to achieve the angry look was inhumane and potentially harmful. Brandy was told that she'd made a poor choice by having a white dog on a white background. Wendy Diamond told Ron that he \"single-handedly [had] the worst photo of a bulldog [she had] ever seen\". The judges agreed that the photo lacked any imagination.", "Beth Joy is upset when Bella Starlet begins to act aggressive.

There was no specific theme in this episode.", "The bottom three were Teresa & Leroy, JD & Galaxy, and Travis & Presley. Victoria Stilwell felt that both Teresa and JD were threatening in their stances when asking their dogs to stay. Presley was the only dog to break his stay, but Travis was able to regain Presley's attention. The decision from the judges seemed difficult to make, but ended up expelling Teresa, feeling that she'd lost sight of the meaning behind the loyalty challenge.", ": Each of the judges asked questions to the contestants individually (ie, \"What makes your dog the Greatest American Dog?\", \"What have you learned at Canine Academy?\"). Afterwards, one of the judges would examine the dog close up. Wendy Diamond approached Andrew and wanted to test how well he socialized with another dog (her own Maltese, Lucky Diamond). She had Laurie leave the room. Andrew played a little bit with Lucky, but seemed more interested in finding out where Laurie was. Wendy Diamond also approached Galaxy and asked JD how often he bathed Galaxy. Presley was tested by Victoria Stilwell on his 'leave it' command, and though not always completely focused, performed well. The judges expelled JD & Galaxy as they felt their relationship was based more on control than co-operation."]}, {"page": "Boxerstock", "response": ["Boxerstock 2011 featured seven bands: Course of Virtue, Sean Waterman, The Greg Burroughs Band, Kick The Robot, JK and the Lost Boys, Jeff Robinson with the Barry Richman Band and The Michelle Malone Banned.

It made Woodhouse famous and enabled her to popularise her dog-training ideas widely among pet owners in Britain and abroad. She believed that there is no such thing as a bad dog but simply inadequate owners who did not assert their position in the pecking order of dog society. Her approach influenced other dog trainers such as Victoria Stilwell, who advocated similar ideas on her show It's Me or the Dog. Although her show was very popular, her advocacy for better-designed and more humane cages for dog transportation was slow in gaining widespread acceptance. In her show she was known for issuing abrupt commands to the owners, and for her on-air criticism of their behaviour. More often than not, the owners looked terrified rather than the dogs."]}, {"page": "Stilwell, Victoria", "response": ["#redirectVictoria Stilwell"]}]}}
