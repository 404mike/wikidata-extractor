There is a story that Oscar Wilde, a friend and correspondent, proposed to her in Dublin in 1879; the significance of this event requires her to have been old enough to get engaged at that time, leading us to her correct birth date of 1862 (not 1866 as often given).", "*The Governess (1912) with Margaret Raine Hunt"]}, {"page": "Averil Beaumont", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margaret Raine Hunt"]}, {"page": "Margaret Hunt", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margaret Raine Hunt"]}, {"page": "List of people buried in Brookwood Cemetery", "response": ["*Margaret Raine Hunt"]}, {"page": "Gambling Hansel", "response": ["Margaret Raine Hunt (1831\u20131912) translated the tale in 1884:", "There was, however, no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world. And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again. Lucifer, however, had nothing to lose, but his mis-shapen devils, and Gambling Hansel won them from him, as with his cards he could not fail to do. And now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to Hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to Heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and Heaven began to crack. So again St. Peter said, \"Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from Heaven.\" And they let him in. But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying. Therefore St. Peter once more said, \"Lord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make all Heaven rebellious.\" So they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day.Margaret Raine Hunt (transl), Household Tales, London: George Bell (1884)"]}, {"page": "The Shroud (fairy tale)", "response": ["The tale was translated by Margaret Raine Hunt in 1884:", "When the mother would not stop crying, he came one night in the little white shroud in which he had been laid in his coffin, and with his wreath of flowers round his head.

The next night the child came again, and held a little light in his hand, and said, \"Look, mother, my shroud is nearly dry, and I can rest in my grave.\u201d Then the mother gave her sorrow into God's keeping, and bore it quietly and patiently, and the child came no more, but slept in his little bed beneath the earth.Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Household Tales, translated by Margaret Raine Hunt, London: George Bell (1884)"]}, {"page": "James Raine (Chancellor)", "response": ["Raine was born in Durham, England, and was the son of James Raine and Margaret Peacock.
