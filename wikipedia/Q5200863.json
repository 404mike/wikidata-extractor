However, on 1 August 1949, he had a huge crash at Wimbledon.  He was following his teammate Cyril Roger for a 5-1 heat win. Roger wobbled in front of him and Johnson fell. As he got back onto his feet he was hit by Wimbledon rider Cyril Brine and knocked down, suffering a fractured skull. He also suffered a near fatal blood clot. This clot may have been jolted loose, thus saving his life, by one stretcher bearer who was walking out of step with the others when Johnson was removed from the track. Doctors wanted Johnson to stay in hospital for six months but he discharged himself after a month."]}, {"page": "1949 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|10 ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||31", "|10 ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||7 ||(2,0,1,1,3)"]}, {"page": "1950 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|18 ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||25", "| ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||5 ||(3,2)"]}, {"page": "1951 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|56 ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||9"]}, {"page": "1952 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|8 ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||25", "|15 ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||2 ||(0,Ex,1,1,0)"]}, {"page": "1950 Speedway National League", "response": ["| Cyril Roger"]}, {"page": "Norwich Stars", "response": ["* Cyril Roger"]}, {"page": "Southampton Saints", "response": ["* Cyril Roger"]}, {"page": "1959 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|Southampton || Ronnie Moore+||  Cyril Roger+ || Neil Street"]}, {"page": "1956 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|30 ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||12"]}, {"page": "1955 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|8  ||align=left| Cyril Roger ||25", "|16 ||align=left| Cyril Roger||(0,0,0,0,Fx) ||0"]}, {"page": "1954 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|26 ||align=left| Cyril Roger||16"]}, {"page": "Cyril Roger (speedway rider)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cyril Roger"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Cyril Roger, 93, speedway rider."]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2015", "response": ["*Cyril Roger, 93, English speedway rider."]}, {"page": "Bob Roger", "response": ["His brothers Cyril Roger and Bert Roger were both speedway riders."]}, {"page": "Bert Roger", "response": ["His brothers Bob Roger and Cyril Roger were both speedway riders."]}]}}
