Stevenage won the game 7\u20130, their biggest victory of the season, with George Boyd scoring four of the goals \u2013 three of which were scored in four second-half minutes. Goals from Steve Morison, Steve Guppy and substitute Craig Dobson completed the scoring. The club were drawn another home tie, to be played on 13 January 2007, this time against Leigh RMI. The visitors took the lead in the first-half, but Stevenage replied with three goals, one from Jamie Slabber and two from Steve Morison, to win the match 3\u20131. Stevenage then faced a Conference National side in the form of Morecambe, with the game being played on 2 February at Christie Park. Steve Morison gave the away side the lead in the first-half, finishing from an acute angle. Morecambe equalised in injury-time of the second-half, Garry Thompson netting from the penalty spot to ensure the tie went to a replay. Four days later, the teams faced each other in the replay, played at Broadhall Way. Stevenage won the game 3\u20130 after the game had gone to extra-time. Steve Morison, with his fifth of the competition, Jon Nurse, and Adam Miller scored Stevenage's goals. Another 3\u20130 victory followed in the quarter-final of the competition, with Stevenage beating Conference South leaders Salisbury City. Daryl McMahon's deflected effort gave the hosts the lead, before Morison and Nurse rounded off the scoring.", "Despite trailing 2\u20130, Stevenage manager Mark Stimson opted against making any changes at the interval, whilst Kidderminster also remained unchanged. Stevenage started the second period with \"much more purpose, showing greater thrust and belief\", with Mitchell Cole shooting wide after a mazy run. Six minutes into the second-half, Stevenage halved the deficit, Morison headed the ball down to Mitchell Cole, who produced a neat right-footed finish to beat Scott Bevan in the Kidderminster goal. Centre-back Santos Gaia spurned the opportunity to restore parity when his header narrowly missed the target on the hour mark. Stimson brought on Craig Dobson in place of Steve Guppy after 63 minutes, and ten minutes later, Dobson levelled the scores at two-apiece. Dobson latched on to a \"hopeful long punt\" from John Nutter and toe poked the ball past onrushing Bevan. Kidderminster responded by making an instant change, bringing on Andrew White for Iyseden Christie. However, it was Stevenage who would go on to complete a remarkable comeback with just two minutes of the game remaining. Stevenage right-back Barry Fuller produced a swinging cross that Morison hooked towards goal on the volley, Bevan saved the shot, but Morison reacted fastest to \"smash home the rebound and snatch the glory\".", "After the match, the Kidderminster players and management team were the first to make the 107\u2013step climb up the Wembley stairs to collect their runners-up medals. Stevenage, led by captain Ronnie Henry, then made the journey up the steps \"cheered on by the Stevenage support\", with Henry being awarded the winners' trophy from the presentation party. Substitute Craig Dobson was awarded the Man of the Match trophy, having \"turned the game and caused no end of problems for the Kidderminster defence\". In the post-match interviews, Kidderminster manager Mark Yates stated he was \"devastated, but proud\" of his players, and believed his side did not deserve to lose the match. Stevenage's manager Mark Stimson, celebrating his third consecutive FA Trophy success, told the players to \"believe in themselves\" at half-time, and felt that his side were always going to go on and win the match once Mitchell Cole had halved the two-goal deficit just after half-time. Steve Morison stated he was \"lost for words\" after scoring the winning goal in the 88th minute \u2014 \"I can't explain how it feels, I can't describe scoring a goal anytime let alone at Wembley in front of 50,000 people. The boys out there were all part of it, it was a tremendous effort. I just did what I'm paid to do and that's score goals\".", "|MF ||22|| Craig Dobson || || "]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Craig Dobson", "| Craig Dobson", "| Craig Dobson"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Milton Keynes Dons F.C. season", "response": ["|| MF ||  Craig Dobson || Stevenage Borough || "]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Milton Keynes Dons F.C. season", "response": ["| 2 January 2009 || MF ||  Craig Dobson || colspan=\"2\" | Released || "]}]}}
