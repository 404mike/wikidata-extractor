His next major work was again an innovation in terms of size: The Fawcett memorial (1885\u201387) featured a bronze bust of politician Henry Fawcett above seven small detailed figures of around fifteen inches, which individually represented Fawcett's virtues. The memorial received praise from critics when it was unveiled at Westminster Abbey on 29 January 1887. By then Gilbert had been commissioned to produce another memorial, this time for Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, which was placed in the Great Hall at Winchester Castle. From the late 1880s to the mid-1890s he was in his most creative period. He diversified into goldsmithing and damascening, making an epergne (1887\u20131890) given to Queen Victoria by officers of the British Army and a chain for the mayor of Preston (1888\u20131892). Gilbert produced medals, such as the cast bronze portrait of Matthew Ridley Corbet (1881) and the struck bronze medal marking 50 years of the Art Union of London (1887). He also created spoons, cups, dishes and jewellery; many of his designs can be seen in the collection of Stichting van Caloen on display at Loppem Castle. Marion Spielmann, a contemporary art critic, wrote in 1901 \"his taste is so pure, his genius so exquisitely right, that he may give full rein to his fancy without danger where another man would run riot and come to grief\"."]}, {"page": "Thomas Lee", "response": ["* Thomas Stirling Lee (1857\u20131916), English sculptor"]}, {"page": "John Birnie Philip", "response": ["His apprentices included Thomas Stirling Lee."]}, {"page": "International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers", "response": ["* Thomas Stirling Lee"]}, {"page": "Stirling Lee", "response": ["#REDIRECTThomas Stirling Lee"]}, {"page": "T Stirling Lee", "response": ["#REDIRECTThomas Stirling Lee"]}, {"page": "T.
