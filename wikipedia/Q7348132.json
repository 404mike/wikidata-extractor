Through connections such as these and the distribution of Eileen Caddy's writings in the form of a booklet titled God Spoke to Me (1967), people came to live at the Caravan Park, eventually forming the 'Findhorn Trust' and the 'Findhorn Community'."]}, {"page": "My Dinner with Andre", "response": ["* Robert Ogilvie Crombie, a Scottish scientist and writer referenced in the film"]}]}}
