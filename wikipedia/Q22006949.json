On transfer deadline day during the January transfer window, it was reported Tyler had been approached by Peterborough about a return to the club as cover for Ben Alnwick. However, a transfer failed to materialise, with Tyler claiming Luton had \"pulled the plug\" on the move, a claim manager Nathan Jones denied, stating no official deadline day approach was made. However, Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony later clarified the situation, claiming that Jones was \"misinformed\" and in fact an approach was made for Tyler's services, but was turned down by Luton. Tyler was recalled to the first-team in a 2\u20131 win over Hartlepool United on 20 February 2016. He made two further appearances in a 3\u20132 win over York City on 27 February 2016, followed by a 1\u20130 win over Morecambe on 1 March 2016. However, Tyler's situation changed once more when it was revealed a re-occurrence of his back injury would keep him out for the rest of the season, as talks with Peterborough resumed about a potential return. This led to Derby County goalkeeper Jonathan Mitchell being brought in on loan until the end of the season as Tyler's replacement.
