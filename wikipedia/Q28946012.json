In 1923, he played in two trial matches and failed to score in all four innings (one of them not out). But he was given a single first-class match by Cambridge in 1923 and, after scoring his customary 0 (not out) in the first innings against Lancashire, he proceeded to unprecedented heights in the second innings by making 2. In the middle of the 1923 season, he turned out in three matches for Glamorgan and though he continued to bat at No 10 or No 11, he made runs: against Nottinghamshire he made 35, including 30 runs off two overs of bowling by fast bowler Frank Matthews. In 1924, he played in four matches for Cambridge University without success, and also returned for two games to Somerset."]}, {"page": "Alan Wright (cricketer)", "response": ["Wright made two first-class appearances for Northamptonshire against Yorkshire in the 1922 County Championship and Nottinghamshire in the 1923 County Championship.

In their second-innings he was dismissed for a duck by Wilfred Rhodes.  Yorkshire won the match by ten wickets.  In the match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, he was dismissed for a duck in Northamptonshire's first-innings by Frank Matthews, while in their second-innings he scored 3 runs, before being dismissed by the same bowler."]}, {"page": "Frank Matthews", "response": ["*Frank Matthews (footballer) (1902\u20131981), English footballer", "*Frank Matthews (drug trafficker) (born 1940), drug trafficker", "*Frank Matthews (Tracy Beaker)", "*Frank Matthews, character in 31 North 62 East", "*Frank Matthews (cricketer) (1892\u20131961), English cricketer"]}]}}
