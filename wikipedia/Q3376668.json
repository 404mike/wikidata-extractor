He was devastating when he had the ball to hand and could sidestep or outpace a defender with equal facility.\nHe scored three tries in the 1957 Five Nations Championship and helped England to their first Grand Slam since the Twenties. In 1958 against Australia at Twickenham, he demonstrated his mastery of the feint to score a dazzling match-winning try. He was capped twenty times in all for England.\nHe then amazed the All Blacks on the 1959 Lions tour, scoring 16 tries in 14 games, including four test matches. He was described by one journalist as 'the zaniest runner of all time'.\nPeter Jackson suffered a stroke in the early months of 2003, was hospitalised and would suffer another stroke in the summer of 2003.

But he was still a deadly finisher. With the ball in hand his two chief devices were the swerve and the change of pace; I have seen no wing to better his control of pace, nor one with a nicer ability to leave an opposing wing or full-back clutching the air... He was always skilful and resourceful, very rarely prepared to let an attack die. He was a master of that now neglected ploy, the cross-kick, which placed the ball just behind the opposing defence for his forwards to run on to... Those of us who watched Arthur Smith have only to close our eyes to see him slip into top gear, like a thoroughbred racehorse.
