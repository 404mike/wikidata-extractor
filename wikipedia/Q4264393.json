He spent six months in the hospital recovering from injuries he sustained during the fall, which included two broken knee caps and a fractured jaw. Leach had been a performer with the Barnum and Bailey Circus and was no stranger to stunting. Prior to his trip over the falls he owned a restaurant on Bridge Street and would boast to customers that anything Annie could do, he could do better.\nLeach returned to Niagara Falls, New York, in 1920 and operated a pool hall. While in his sixties he attempted to swim the whirlpool rapids but failed after several attempts. During these aborted attempts, Bobby Leach was rescued by William \"Red\" Hill Sr., a riverman, who knew the Falls well and became well known in the area for later rescues. \nIn 1926, while on a publicity tour in New Zealand, Leach injured his leg when he slipped on an orange peel.

Soon after exiting the barrel, she said, \"No one ought ever do that again.\" Days before Taylor's attempt, her domestic cat was sent over the falls in her barrel to test its strength. The cat survived the plunge unharmed and later posed with Taylor in photographs.Parish, Charles Carlin, Queen of the Mist: The Story of Annie Edson Taylor, First Person Ever to Go Over Niagara Falls and Survive (Empire State Books, Interlaken NY, 1987, ), p. 55. Since Taylor's historic ride, over a dozen people have intentionally gone over the falls in or on a device, despite her advice. Some have survived unharmed, but others have drowned or been severely injured. Survivors face charges and stiff fines, as it is now illegal, on both sides of the border, to attempt to go over the falls. Charles Stephens, a 58-year-old barber from Bristol, England, went over the falls in a wooden barrel in July 1920 and was the first person to die in an endeavor of this type. Bobby Leach went over Horseshoe Falls in a crude steel barrel in 1911 and needed rescuing by William \"Red\" Hill Sr. Hill again came to the rescue of Leach following his failed attempt to swim the Niagara Gorge in 1920. In 1928, \"Smiling Jean\" Lussier tried an entirely different concept, going over the falls in a large rubber ball; he was successful and survived the ordeal."]}, {"page": "Cohoes, New York", "response": ["Around the start of the 20th century, daredevil Bobby Leach practiced going over the Cohoes Falls in a barrel before he performed the same stunt at Niagara.

The film portrayed Stanley as a loose cannon and showed some instances where he committed personal fouls for late hits. Dickerson, in particular, was harshly critical of Stanley, due to an incident at Campisi's Restaurant in 1983; SMU had asked Dickerson, who was starting his rookie season with the Los Angeles Rams, to come and meet with several incoming freshmen. After Stanley made a wisecrack about being bigger than him, Dickerson responded by angrily threatening to beat him up if he didn't stop mouthing off, saying, \"You're still in high school, you motherfucker.

Other daredevil attempts have been made by Bobby Leach, Charles Stephens, Jean Lussier, Karel Soucek, and Steve Trotter. In 1903, baseball player Ed Delahanty died after accidentally going over the falls while intoxicated. Following the death of daredevil William \"Red\" Hill, Jr. in 1951, Ontario Premier Leslie Frost issued an order to the Niagara Parks Commission to arrest anyone found to be performing stunts at the falls. Both Canadian and American authorities began to issue fines for daredevils at the falls; as of 2011, the fines are $10,000 CAD (approximately $7,700 USD) in Canada, or $25,000 USD (approximately $32,800 CAD) in the United States.", "|  ||  || style=\"background:salmon;\"| Fatality || Horseshoe Falls || Stephens, from Bristol in the UK, went over the falls in a barrel.

Stephens had not only strapped himself into the barrel but also strapped his feet to the anvil. As a result, Stephens was dragged under the Falls after the anvil broke the bottom of the barrel.
