His 109 caps was more than 20 clear of then-second-placed Scott Murray; his 96 starts are also the most in Scotland history. He remained Scotland's most-capped player until Ross Ford overtook him in 2017. Paterson was also involved in more defeats (65) than any other Scotland internationalist. Despite not being a regular kicker until after he had amassed 26 caps, he retired as Scotland's all-time leader in points (809), conversions (86) and penalties (140). Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his Scotland career was his versatility; he retired as one of Scotland's three top cap-winners at two different positions. Paterson's 49 caps on the wing were third to Kenny Logan (63) and Sean Lamont (52); his 43 caps as a fullback were also third, this time to Gavin Hastings (61) and Andy Irvine (47).
