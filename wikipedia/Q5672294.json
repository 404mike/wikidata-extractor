He was spotted by Jack Durston while practising at the Middlesex Indoor School at Acton. Seconded to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), his duties included rolling the wicket.\nHe joined Middlesex County Cricket Club in 1934 and made his 1st XI debut in 1946. He played in 162 first-class matches as a right-handed batsman before his retirement in 1955. He scored 6,141 runs at an average of 25.80, with 9 hundreds and 30 fifties. He took 59 catches and 50 wickets with his off-spin at an average of 32.56, with a personal best of 5/52. He was awarded his county cap in 1948. His best season was in 1953, when he scored 1,564 runs. He was awarded a joint benefit with Alec Thompson by Middlesex in 1955 and a joint testimonial by MCC with Len Muncer in 1971.\nHe served as an Able Seaman with the Eastern Front in the Indian Ocean, during the Second World War, but saw little action. Despite this, he gained the nickname of 'Admiral', which remained with him for the rest of his life. He played in several matches, while docked at Durban.\nHe joined the MCC coaching staff in 1956 and also umpired several first-class matches. He became MCC's Assistant Head Coach and he succeeded Jim Sims as the Middlesex scorer in 1973.\nHe retired at the age of 75 and died suddenly in Enfield, Middlesex in 1995.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["In 1972, at the age of 16, Botham left school intent on playing cricket for Somerset, who retained his contract but felt he was too young to justify a full professional deal.Murphy (1988), pp. 18\u201319. So, Botham joined the ground staff at Lord's.Doust (1981), p. 39. As a ground boy, he had numerous tasks such as \"cleaning the pavilion windows, pushing the roller on matchdays, selling scorecards, pressing electronic buttons on the scoreboards and rushing bowling analyses to the dressing-room\".Murphy (1988), pp. 22\u201323. He also received coaching and plenty of time in the practice nets, and was often the first to arrive and the last to leave practice.Murphy (1988), p. 22. Despite his time in the nets, Botham was only considered by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) coach Harry Sharp to have the potential to become a \"good, average county cricketer.\"Doust (1981), p. 41. Botham travelled to play for Somerset under-25s a number of times during the season, but failed to excel in any of the matches. His appearances for the MCC were of a similar vein: he rarely scored more than 50 runs, and was used sparingly as a bowler. In one such match against \"Scotland A\", the MCC Young Cricketers used eight bowlers in their second innings, but Botham was not among them."]}, {"page": "William Cameron Menzies", "response": ["| Harry Sharp, Bert Glennon"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Middlesex won the toss and decided to bat, Brown and Edrich opening with a stand of 50 before Brown was out lbw to the seamer Colin Scott. Edrich went on to score 50 but, apart from some resistance by tailenders Sims and Young, Middlesex's batting collapsed as Gloucestershire's great off spinner Tom Goddard took seven for 70. Middlesex were all out for 180 but Sims (six for 65) and Young (four for 55) turned the tables and bowled out Gloucestershire for 153. At close of play on Saturday, Middlesex had reached 9 for 1 in their second innings, Goddard having taken the key wicket of Edrich, so Monday's play began with Middlesex ahead by 36 and nine wickets standing. The decisive phase of the match was a third wicket partnership on Monday morning between Harry Sharp and the captain Robins. Scoring 46 and 45 respectively, they shared a stand of 70 runs which Playfair described as \"vital\". Otherwise, Middlesex again collapsed and Goddard took eight for 86 to complete an outstanding match analysis of fifteen for 156. So Gloucestershire with a day and a half remaining needed 169 to win. Jack Crapp tried to hold the innings together and scored 40 but Gloucestershire were rolled over for only 100 to lose by 68 runs. Young took five for 27 but an important role was again played by Sharp, this time as an off spinner, taking the wickets of three of Gloucestershire's top six batsmen, two of them without scoring. Playfair points out that Sharp at the time was still only a member of the Lord's ground staff but he played the key part in winning the match that ultimately settled the championship.", "As Playfair put it, \"few will dispute that the best side won the championship\". Middlesex's first four batsmen \u2014 Robertson, Brown, Edrich and Compton \u2014 scored between them 12,193 runs in all first-class matches, a level of success unprecedented in county cricket. The other batting positions were contested by George Mann, who was heir-apparent to Robins as club captain and succeeded him in 1948; Alan Fairbairn, a 1947 debutant who scored centuries in each of his first two county matches; Harry Sharp and Alec Thompson. The three main bowlers were Gray, Young and the veteran Sims. Ian Bedford, aged seventeen, made his debut and took twelve wickets in his first two matches. Middlesex also made effective use as bowlers of Robins, Edrich and Denis Compton. Playfair noted the consistently high standard of the Middlesex fielding, especially by Brown, while Leslie Compton as wicket-keeper was a great success.Playfair, pp. 84\u201385. Middlesex made exclusive use of Lord's Cricket Ground in St John's Wood, north London, for their thirteen home matches."]}, {"page": "Len Muncer", "response": ["After his playing career ended he returned to Lord's and was head coach of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) from 1964 until he retired in 1978.Cricketer, November 1978, p. 30.
