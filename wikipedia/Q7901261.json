She rented a shop and house at 25 Ludlow Street, Chorlton-upon-Medlock, Manchester which were of high enough monetary value to qualify their occupier under the pre-1867 \u00a310 household borough franchise. Consequently, her name appeared on the list of voters for Manchester in error as the alternate her name, Lilly, was mistaken for that of a man. Her accidental inclusion on the list was discovered by one of the candidates for election, Jacob Bright, a supporter of women's suffrage. Alongside his wife, Ursula Mellor Bright, he was a founder of the Manchester branch of the National Society for Women\u2019s Suffrage, in January 1867. Bright\u2019s election committee alerted Lydia Becker, the society\u2019s secretary, to Maxwell's appearance on the list, and she informed Maxwell of the situation."]}]}}
