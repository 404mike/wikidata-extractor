He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \"genre contrarian\". Robert Macfarlane has said: \"Harrison is best known as one of the restless fathers of modern SF, but to my mind he is among the most brilliant novelists writing today, with regard to whom the question of genre is an irrelevance.\" The Times Literary Supplement described him as \"a singular stylist\" and the Literary Review called him \"a witty and truly imaginative writer\".Quoted in 'M. John Harrison News, Interzone 13 (Autumn 1985).", "Robert Macfarlane wrote an introduction to the 2013 reissue of Climbers.

Of course there's a lot of appallingly bad pulp fiction but when this stuff finds something new and locates itself as part of the tradition it's as good as anything. There are some writers in that tradition in terms of their use of language who as prose stylists are the equal of anyone alive. I'm thinking of people like John Crowley, M John Harrison, Gene Wolfe.\"  William Gibson, Robert Macfarlane and Clive Barker, who has referred to him as \"a blazing original\". Olivia Laing has said of him: \"No one alive can write sentences as he can. He\u2019s the missing evolutionary link between William Burroughs and Virginia Woolf\".

This is noted as an influence by nature writers who include Robert Macfarlane and Richard Mabey. She also wrote poetry and three novels set in small fictional communities in Northern Scotland.
