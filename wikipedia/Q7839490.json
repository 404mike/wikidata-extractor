Traditionally, the Channel Islands were part of the diocese. After a conflict with the 97th bishop, oversight of the Channel Islands had been delegated from 2014 to 2019 to Trevor Willmott, an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese and, until his 2019 retirement, Bishop of Dover.https://www.canterburydiocese.org/bishop-of-dover-retires/ In January 2021, the Channel Islands were transferred permanently to the Diocese of Salisbury. ", "The Channel Islands were transferred from the Diocese of Coutances in Normandy, France, in 1500 by papal bull. The transfer was later confirmed by a letter from Elizabeth I and an order in council dated 11 March 1569 which expressly perpetually united the islands with the diocese and, for avoidance of doubt, the bishop, which remains the law.D. M. Ogier, The Government and Law of Guernsey, p. 21. The islands have for centuries operated their own canon law variants under the bishop. The islands were voluntarily removed from the present bishop's involvement in 2014 after a dispute with Bishop Dakin, who agreed to their Anglican churches' worship, work and ethos being overseen by Trevor Willmott, then the Bishop of Dover. This measure is ratified by the parent province authorities of Canterbury as interim. It arises by use of the powers of episcopal delegation: Bishop Dakin delegates his authority up to the Archbishop of Canterbury who in turn delegates it down to the Bishop of Dover. Bishop Willmott was previously Bishop of Basingstoke, a suffragan see of the Winchester diocese, and in that capacity was familiar with the islands' preferences."]}, {"page": "Diocese in Europe", "response": ["*16 January 2020present: Trevor Willmott, retired Bishop of Dover"]}, {"page": "Westcott House, Cambridge", "response": ["*Trevor Willmott, former bishop of Dover"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Dover", "response": ["|align=\"center\"| 2010 ||align=\"center\"| 2019 || Trevor Willmott || (b. 1951).
