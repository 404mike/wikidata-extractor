With Reddy the star in a strong team that never dropped out of the top 4 all season. His ability to run with the ball, make play, create and score goals earned him hero status amongst the club's supporters. His impressive partnership with new signing Gary Jones was arguably one of the best in the league. Between them, Reddy and Jones managed to find the net 31 times throughout the season. During the season, the club had a decent run in the League Cup defeating both Derby County and Tottenham Hotspur, before losing to Newcastle United. Michael was involved in all three games. Reddy's impressive performances had also earned him the right named in the League 2 Team of the Year. But in an unfortunate twist of fate, Reddy's season was cruelly interrupted by a hip injury in March and as a result the striker did not complete another ninety minutes for the remainder of the campaign. The Mariners faltered and fell out of the automatic promotion places on the penultimate day of the season. Reddy was deemed fit enough to take part in the play-off campaign, but it was goals from Gary Jones and Ben Futcher that defeated Lincoln City in the semi final stages. Slade opted to play Reddy from the start in the final at the Millennium Stadium against Cheltenham Town but luck fell against him as he was substituted with concussion after a clash of heads. Grimsby attempted to use Junior Mendes and Gary Cohen to help cater for Jones in attack, but without Reddy, the club went on to lose the game 1\u20130, ending all hopes of promotion after a promising season."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|20||Junior Mendes||||MF||1 (4)||0||0||0||1 (1)||0||0||0||0||0||2 (5)||0"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["Following the narrow play-off defeat in May 2006 to neighbours Barnsley, the 2006\u201307 season started with high hopes that this would be the year that Huddersfield Town would make the step up to the Championship.
