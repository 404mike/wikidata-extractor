[...] The philosophical problem, like all philosophical problems, is a confusion in the conceptual scheme.\" Hacker's critique extends beyond Chalmers and the hard problem and is directed against contemporary philosophy of mind and neuroscience more broadly. Along with the neuroscientist Max Bennett, he has argued that most of contemporary neuroscience remains implicitly dualistic in its conceptualizations and is predicated on the mereological fallacy of ascribing psychological concepts to the brain that can properly be ascribed only to the person as a whole.

This resolute reading is meant to show that even in the Tractatus, the purpose of philosophy is the clarification of philosophical problems, aimed at the elucidation of the sentences of the language through which we express ourselves rather than at propounding philosophical theses.Conant, James and Diamond, Cora \"On reading the Tractatus Resolutely\", in The Lasting Significance of Wittgenstein's Philosophy, edited by Max K\u00f6lbel and Bernhard Weiss, Routledge, 2004.

Hacker, as well as others like Ian Proops and Michael Forster have in turn criticized Conant's representation of them.The controversy has been pursued especially in the form of contributions to a series of collections of essays devoted to the topic, the most influential of these is probably The New Wittgenstein (op. cit.), and more recently Beyond the Tractatus Wars (ed.
