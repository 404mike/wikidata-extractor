The two translations were often compared in the way they addressed Tolstoy's \"rough\" language, with Bartlett proposing that Tolstoy was \"often a clumsy and occasionally ungrammatical writer, but there is a majesty and elegance to his prose which needs to be emulated in translation wherever possible\". However Schwartz's point, as reviewer Masha Gessen described, was that \"Tolstoy's writing is indeed remarkable for its purposeful roughness, the use of repetition, and the obsessive breaking of clich\u00e9s to force the reader to consider the meaning of each word and phrase\". In her introduction to the text, Schwartz notes:  English translators have tended to view Tolstoy's sometimes radical choices as 'mistakes' to be corrected, as if Tolstoy, had he known better, or cared more, would not have broken basic rules of literary language.
