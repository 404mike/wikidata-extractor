In a live review about a Siouxsie and the Banshees' concert in July 1978, critic Nick Kent wrote that, concerning their music, \"[P]arallels and comparisons can now be drawn with gothic rock architects like the Doors and, certainly, early Velvet Underground\". In March 1979, in his review of Magazine's second album Secondhand Daylight, Kent noted that there was \"a new austere sense of authority\" in the music, with a \"dank neo-Gothic sound\". Later that year, the term was also used by Joy Division's manager, Tony Wilson on 15 September in an interview for the BBC TV programme's Something Else. Wilson described Joy Division as \"gothic\" compared to the pop mainstream, right before a live performance of the band.
