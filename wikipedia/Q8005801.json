Prior to his appointment as governor, McCleary served as High Commissioner to Malaysia from 2006 to 2010.Shortly after his arrival in the British Virgin Islands, the territory was damaged by Hurricane Earl. Although at the time of his appointment there was a degree of tension over constitutional matters between the United Kingdom and the British Virgin Islands, McCleary won plaudits in the local press for his deft handling of the situation.  Currently, he is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system. Previously, he was also one of the patrons of the British Theatre Playhouse, a company aiming at the production of British theatrical plays and musical shows.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Governor of the Virgin Islands", "response": ["* William Boyd McCleary (20 August 2010 \u2013 1 August 2014)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors of the British Virgin Islands", "response": ["|20 August 2010 to 1 August 2014||William Boyd McCleary|| Governor"]}, {"page": "Outline of the British Virgin Islands", "response": ["** Monarch's representative: Governor of the British Virgin Islands, William Boyd McCleary"]}, {"page": "2010 New Year Honours", "response": ["* William Boyd McCleary, CVO, British High Commissioner, Malaysia"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2010", "response": ["**#William Boyd McCleary, Governor of the British Virgin Islands (2010\u20132014)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2011", "response": ["**Governor\u00a0\u2013 William Boyd McCleary, Governor of the British Virgin Islands (2010\u20132014)"]}, {"page": "2011 British Virgin Islands general election", "response": ["The House of Assembly was dissolved on 13 September 2011, by the Governor, Mr William Boyd McCleary, on advice from the Premier.
