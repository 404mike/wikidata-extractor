Culpeper catalogued hundreds of outdoor medicinal herbs. He scolded contemporaries for some of the methods they used: \"This not being pleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers, Dr. Reason and Dr. Experience, and took a voyage to visit my mother Nature, by whose advice, together with the help of Dr. Diligence, I at last obtained my desire; and, being warned by Mr. Honesty, a stranger in our days, to publish it to the world, I have done it.\"Culpeper came from a line of notabilities, including the courtier Thomas Culpeper, who was reputed to be a lover of Catherine Howard (also a distant relative), the fifth wife of Henry VIII.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chives", "response": ["Chives have been cultivated in Europe since the Middle Ages (from the fifth until the 15th centuries), although their usage dates back 5,000 years.

Culpeper detailed plants and the conditions they could treat. In the 18th century, much of clinical pharmacology was established by the work of William Withering. Pharmacology as a scientific discipline did not further advance until the mid-19th century amid the great biomedical resurgence of that period. Before the second half of the nineteenth century, the remarkable potency and specificity of the actions of drugs such as morphine, quinine and digitalis were explained vaguely and with reference to extraordinary chemical powers and affinities to certain organs or tissues. The first pharmacology department was set up by Rudolf Buchheim in 1847, in recognition of the need to understand how therapeutic drugs and poisons produced their effects. Subsequently, the first pharmacology department in England was set up in 1905 at University College London."]}, {"page": "1616", "response": ["* October 18 \u2013 Nicholas Culpeper, English botanist (d. 1654)"]}, {"page": "1654", "response": ["* January 10 \u2013 Nicholas Culpeper, English botanist (b. 1616)"]}, {"page": "Valerian (herb)", "response": ["The seventeenth century astrological botanist Nicholas Culpeper thought the plant was \"under the influence of Mercury, and therefore hath a warming faculty.\" He recommended both herb and root, and said that \"the root boiled with liquorice, raisons and aniseed is good for those troubled with cough.

William Turner's account, written about 1597, focuses on the ability of the leaves and bark to 'stay the spitting of blood, and all other fluxes of blood,' if boiled in wine and drunk; but he does add a treatment for fever: 'the green boughs with the leaves may very well be brought into chambers and set about the beds of those that be sick of fevers, for they do mightily cool the heat of the air, which thing is a wonderful refreshing to the sick patients.'"]}, {"page": "Mentha pulegium", "response": ["Early settlers in colonial Virginia used dried pennyroyal to eradicate pests.
