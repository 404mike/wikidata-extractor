Almost as soon as he arrived his evangelising changed Indian education: in 1832 another Scot, John Wilson (Scottish missionary) established a school in Bombay.  Duff's methods were widely imitated and his cumulative twenty-five years in the subcontinent were largely characterized by the establishment of western-style educational institutions warmly received by Ram Mohan Roy. Duff can be credited with creating a framework that influenced educational policy and practice during the nineteenth century and beyond. Since his schools catered mostly to the Hindu middle class, he was able to receive attention from the government which helped to spread his methods and ideas.  Several other English schools were established because the General Assemblies Institution was so successful.  The success and influence of Duff's college led to the founding of the Calcutta Medical College.  Hindu scriptures forbid people of higher castes from touching dead bodies, which prevented medical students from performing cadaver dissections.  Students from Duff's college expressed that their liberal, English education had \"freed their minds from prejudice and the dissection of the human body was not objectionable to them.\"Emmott, D.H., \"Alexander Duff and the Foundation of Modern Education in India\", British Journal of Education Studies, Vol.13, No. 2 (1965): 164 This new idea allowed higher caste Indians to pursue medical professions, therefore advancing healthcare in India."]}, {"page": "Chuma and Susi", "response": ["On 26 June, Bishop William Tozer arrived as the new head of the UMCA, bringing government orders ending the expedition.

Gidi Yahalom explained in an article in 2015 that the actual reason for the identification of the Spring in Jezreel in Ain Jalut and not in Ein Jezreel (known in Arabic as \"Ain al-Metiyeh\", the \"Dying Spring\"), is the small size of the Ein Jezreel in comparison to the Ain Jalut.
