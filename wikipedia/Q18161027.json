He was a specialist in Coleoptera.Lewis was born on 5 August 1839, the second son of the Rev. R. Cr. Lewis, first Vicar of St. John's, Blackheath, S.E. He was educated at the Blackheath Proprietary School.\nIn 1862 he went to China for the tea trade and returned to England twenty years later, after also spending periods in Japan and Sri Lanka.He married Miss Julia Hunter, of Iiiuer Park Road, Wimbledon Common. Soon after his marriage in 1867, he spent several years traveling and collecting beetles in Japan, and he visited that country again in 1880. He also collected in Ceylon and Algiers.\nAn ardent entomologist from boyhood, Lewis made important collections of beetles in the East, most of which were acquired by the British Museum. He authored numerous taxa, including 750 species in the family Histeridae (a tiny fraction being listed here) and had been for many years the recognized authority on the beetles of the family Histeridae, of which he bequeathed to the British Museum a magnificent collection of over 12,000 specimens, including the types of 110 fewer than 700 species described by himself. Much of the collection formed during his first visit to Japan was destroyed, although many new species were described by the late H. M. Bates.\nLewis died at Folkestone on 5 September 1926.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Lewis", "response": ["George Lewis may refer to:", "* George Lewis (clarinetist) (1900\u20131968), New Orleans jazz clarinettist", "* George Lewis, Jr. aka Twin Shadow (born 1983), Dominican-American musician and actor", "* George Lewis (MP for Cardiff), Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardiff, 1586", "* George Lewis (politician) (1820\u20131887), American politician, mayor of Roxbury, Massachusetts", "* George Lewis (athlete) (1917\u20132011), track and field athlete from Trinidad and Tobago", "* George Lewis (footballer, born 1875) (1875\u2013?), English footballer", "* George Lewis (footballer, born 1913) (1913\u20131981), Watford and Southampton footballer", "* George Lewis (footballer, born 2000), Rwandan-born, Norwegian footballer", "* George Lewis (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s", "* George Lewis (rugby) (born 1901), Welsh rugby union and rugby league footballer", "* George Lewis (British Army officer) (1735\u20131791), British colonel", "* George Lewis (Royal Marines officer) (1774\u20131854), in Napoleonic Wars and War of 1812", "* George Lewis (coleopterist) (1839\u20131926), English entomologist", "* George Lewis (journalist) (born 1943), American television reporter", "* Sir George Lewis, 1st Baronet (1833\u20131911), UK solicitor, baronet", "* Slave George (1794\u20131811), murder victim, known also as George Lewis", "* George Lewis (priest) (died 1730), Archdeacon of Meath"]}, {"page": "Syntelia", "response": ["Syntelia is a genus of middle-sized beetles described by John O.
