This interview came almost 40 years after the abolition of the death penalty for murder. As Shadow Home Secretary Davis turned the Conservatives away from the Labour Party's plan to reintroduce identity cards, citing spiralling costs and libertarian issues. He turned initial Conservative support into one of concern and abstention, making the final change to one of opposition much easier. Davis believed that once the true cost and unreliability of the ID card scheme was explained to the general public they would turn against it. He was also credited by some commentators with \"claiming the scalps\" of two Labour ministers, David Blunkett and Beverley Hughes, after both were forced to resign."]}, {"page": "List of barons in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["#*Beverley Hughes, Baroness Hughes of Stretford"]}, {"page": "Hazel Blears", "response": ["In 2005 Blears was a member of a parliamentary tap-dancing troupe known as the Division Belles (a play on the term \"division bell\").
