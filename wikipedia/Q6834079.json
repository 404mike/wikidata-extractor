Nine years later the Elder and his wife went through a legal separation, \u2018on account of legal disputes and the most violent quarrels\u2019. The immediate cause of the dispute was his affair with a married woman.\u201d Michael S. Robinson noted that  \u201con 17/27 July 1662, he and his wife agreed to part. A condition of the separation was that the Elder could recover from his son Adriaen \u2018two royal gifts\u2019, presumably gifts from Charles II for work done in England.\u201d  Cordingly\u2019s account further relates that the dispute was still continuing after another ten years, since \u201cin the autumn of 1672 Judith complained to the woman\u2019s husband.\u201d Robinson adds that by 1674 the couple \u201cmust have been reconciled\u201d, for at a chance meeting with Pieter Blaeu in Amsterdam in July the Elder explained that he was only visiting for a few days \u201cin order to fetch his wife\u201d.

Although it bears the inscription \"Capt Kempthorne's Action in the Mary Rose a small Frigate with seven Algerines in the Mediterranean in 1669\", this inscription was probably added in the late eighteenth century, according to Geoffrey Callender and Michael S. Robinson, and is erroneous; there is no correspondence between this image and Hollar's eyewitness version, but in the centre of the painting is a small enemy boat that corresponds directly to one referred to in an account of the 1681 action in the Kingfisher. The painting had previously been attributed to Willem van de Velde the Younger, or speculated to be by van de Velde the Elder, before Monamy's signature and the date of 1734 were found when it was catalogued in the early 1930s.
