A journeyman striker, he is usually an instantly recognisable figure on the pitch due to his original \u2013 and most of all colourful \u2013 hairstyles.\nWith Queens Park Rangers in 2001, he was loaned out to Stevenage Borough, before beginning a career in non-league football with Margate in 2001. He moved on to Heybridge Swifts via Gravesend & Northfleet the following year, before joining Erith & Belvedere in 2003. He rejoined the Football League with Huddersfield Town in 2004, before joining Darlington the next year, after a successful loan spell. He spent the 2006\u201307 season with Port Vale, before becoming a Sheffield Wednesday player. He found success and popularity at both clubs, before he joined Charlton Athletic in 2010, after two loan spells. He moved into Scottish football with Hibernian in 2011, before departing in January 2012. Two months later he emigrated to China to sign with Tianjin TEDA to become the first English footballer in the Chinese Super League. He returned to the English game in August 2012, when he joined Preston North End for a brief spell. He joined Scunthorpe United on a short-term basis in January 2013, before signing with Tranmere Rovers in July 2013. He was loaned out to Macclesfield Town in February 2014.\nAfter three of his brothers, Efe, Bright and Stephen Sodje, were sentenced to 18, 21 and 30 months in prison respectively for fraud in September 2017 (having siphoned off money from a charity, the Sodje Sports Foundation), a European Arrest Warrant was issued in relation to Akpo.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gary Megson", "response": ["On 13 September 2007, Leicester City chairman Milan Mandari\u0107 announced Gary Megson as the new manager of the club, citing Megson's \"wealth of experience\" as a deciding factor in the appointment.

Foyle took over first team responsibilities at the club on 13 February 2004 after Brian Horton left by mutual consent, and the team narrowly missed out on a play-off place on goal difference at the end of the 2003\u201304 season. Following the end of the season, Foyle aimed to keep players at the club, but eventually lost top scorer Stephen McPhee and midfielder Marc Bridge-Wilkinson. The club also had to make massive cut backs due to having just come out of administration and when Steve Brooker (a player signed by Horton on Foyle's recommendation) was sold to Bristol City any chance of a play-off push was unlikely. Vale eventually finished 17th in a frustrating season where many players suffered injuries leaving the squad threadbare on more than one occasion. The next two seasons saw an increase in the playing budget as Vale got their house in order after administration and Foyle steered the side to 13th and 12th-place finishes in League One. Two cup runs to the 4th round of the FA Cup in 2005\u201306 and 4th round of the League Cup in 2006\u201307, coupled with the selling of players such as Chris Birchall and Billy Paynter saw the club make a profit on the financial front. He also signed striker Akpo Sodje from Darlington, who would be sold on to Sheffield Wednesday for a reported \u00a3300,000 a year later. Showing a talent for signing attackers, he bought striker Leon Constantine for \u00a320,000 from Torquay United, who would hit 26 goals in the 2006\u201307 season; attacking midfielder Danny Whitaker from Macclesfield Town, who would have a long and successful career; and winger Jeff Smith, who impressed enough to win a \u00a360,000 transfer to Carlisle United."]}, {"page": "Sam Sodje", "response": ["On 18 August, Sodje joined Portsmouth on trial.

The club had moved to sign Arter after impressing assistant manager Jason Tindall during a scouting assignment, with a previous transfer embargo having been recently lifted. Two months later, after impressing during the club's preseason fixtures, he made his debut in their first match of the season, away to his former team Charlton. He was booked in the first half for a foul on Akpo Sodje and substituted at half time for Michael Symes as Bournemouth lost 1\u20130. He was subsequently dropped from the first team, not making another start in the league for Bournemouth until November, having also been hampered by a hernia. The hernia eventually required surgery, resulting in Arter being ruled out for a month."]}]}}
