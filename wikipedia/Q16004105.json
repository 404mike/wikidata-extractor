Smith, Horace Snary and Norman Armstrong were among players who later became prominent who were brought on through this system, and Smith made his first-class debut in the 1925 season. He played in 19 matches in that season but took only 12 wickets. At this stage he was apparently regarded primarily as a batting all-rounder: he hit three scores of more than 50 in the season, though his batting average for 448 runs was only 13.57. Over the next two seasons his figures got worse in terms of number of matches played, batting average and number of wickets taken."]}, {"page": "Horace (given name)", "response": ["*Horace Snary (1897\u20131966), English cricketer"]}]}}
