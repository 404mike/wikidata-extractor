This model is based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory by Jeffrey Alan Gray, which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system (BAS) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of neuroticism and introversion. Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects. For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000). found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive BIS reported higher levels of average negative affect, while people with more sensitive BAS reported higher levels of positive affect. Also, Zelenski and Larsen (1999) found that people with more sensitive BAS reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive BIS reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction."]}, {"page": "Gray's biopsychological theory of personality", "response": ["The biopsychological theory of personality is a model of the general biological processes relevant for human psychology, behavior, and personality.

Gray, a student of Eysenck, studied personality traits as individual differences in sensitivity to rewarding and punishing stimuli. The significance of Gray's work and theories was his use of biology to define behavior, which stimulated a lot of subsequent research.."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford", "response": ["* Jeffrey Alan Gray, psychologist"]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Gray", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jeffrey Alan Gray"]}]}}
