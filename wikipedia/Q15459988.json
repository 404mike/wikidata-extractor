He changed his name from Schloesser to Slesser in 1914, preferring the Anglicised form when Britain went to war with Germany.\nIn terms of his socio-economic and political viewpoints, Slesser gained notoriety for being one of the biggest advocates of distributist thought in government, opposing both unregulated capitalism and traditional socialism while arguing on behalf of a more mixed economy with capital spread more among ordinary men. His role helped push the Distributist League's interests until he left the House of Commons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sylvia Sayer", "response": ["Sayer was described in The Times newspaper in 1971 as \"a militant conservationist, who is a full-time thorn in the sides of those authorities and others who want to flood, fence, dig up, knock down and otherwise damage the Dartmoor national park.\" Crispin Gill wrote about her in his introduction to Dartmoor \u2013 A New Study published in 1970 as having \"roused the conscience of a [vast] number of people\" and he described her as an indefatigable worker with an enormous knowledge; he also referred to Henry Slesser's description of her as \"the shield of the moor\"."]}, {"page": "Solicitor General for England and Wales", "response": ["|Sir Henry Slesser"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1910\u20131936)", "response": ["*Sir Henry Slesser (1883\u20131979)"]}, {"page": "Stanley Spencer", "response": ["Spencer lived in Cookham until April 1920 when he moved to Bourne End to stay with the trade union lawyer Henry Slesser and his wife.

In all, during the year he spent at the Slessor's home, Spencer painted some twenty pictures including Christ Carrying the Cross, which is now in the Tate. In 1921 Spencer stayed with Muirhead Bone at Steep in Hampshire where he worked on mural designs for a village hall war memorial scheme which was never completed. In 1923 Spencer spent the summer in Poole, Dorset, with Henry Lamb. While there he worked on sketch designs for another possible war memorial scheme. These designs convinced two early patrons of Spencer's work, Louis and Mary Behrend, to commission a group of paintings as a memorial to Mary's brother, Lieutenant Henry Willoughby Sandham, who had died in the war. The Behrends planned to build a chapel in the village of Burghclere in Berkshire to house the paintings."]}, {"page": "Patrick Hastings", "response": ["The next day Hastings called for both the Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, to ask their opinion on the prosecution.Hyde (1960) p. 144 Maxton knew Campbell, and revealed that he was only the temporary editor and had not written the article \u2013 the article had actually been copied from another newspaper.Hyde (1960) p. 145 Along with Guy Stevenson, the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the Director of Public Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that it was entirely his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case now they had started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Henry Slesser"]}, {"page": "First MacDonald ministry", "response": ["| Sir Henry Slesser"]}, {"page": "City of York (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["*Labour: Henry Slesser"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|Henry Slesser"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Henry Slesser, Leeds South East, 1924\u201329"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Henry Slesser"]}, {"page": "Leeds South East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Henry Slesser"]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish politicians", "response": ["*Henry Slesser (1924\u20131929) Labour MP"]}, {"page": "Henry Herman Slesser", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Slesser"]}, {"page": "Slesser", "response": ["* Henry Slesser (1883\u20131979), British barrister, politician, and judge"]}, {"page": "1929 Leeds South East by-election", "response": ["The Leeds South East by-election of 1929 was held on 1 August 1929.
