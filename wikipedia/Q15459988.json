He changed his name from Schloesser to Slesser in 1914, preferring the Anglicised form when Britain went to war with Germany.\nIn terms of his socio-economic and political viewpoints, Slesser gained notoriety for being one of the biggest advocates of distributist thought in government, opposing both unregulated capitalism and traditional socialism while arguing on behalf of a more mixed economy with capital spread more among ordinary men. His role helped push the Distributist League's interests until he left the House of Commons.", "link_mentions": {}}}
