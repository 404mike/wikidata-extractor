At the time, as in cricket, the officials were not permitted to award a goal unless the players appealed for it, thus no goal was given.  It is not recorded why the Oxford players never appealed. The best effort for the Engineers came when Henry Renny-Tailyour's shot struck the goalpost.  Late in the game the \"Sappers\" mounted a series of attacks on the Oxford goal but were unable to score, being repeatedly thwarted by Nepean.  Oxford thus won 2\u20130 and secured the cup.", "|FB ||||Charles Mackarness"]}, {"page": "Walpole Vidal", "response": ["In the next season, Oxford again qualified for the final, this time to face the Royal Engineers at Kennington Oval on 14 March 1874.
