During this time, his laboratory made major contributions to the understanding of genetic mutations and suppressors in S. pombe, as well as the construction of a genetic map of this yeast. As the recognized leader in fission yeast genetics, Leupold had a great impact on the first generation of scientists to use S. pombe for genetic studies. In 1973, Paul Nurse spent a couple months with Leupold to learn S. pombe genetics before beginning his seminal studies on cell cycle control with Murdoch Mitchison in Edinburgh, Scotland.
