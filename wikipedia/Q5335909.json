A total of 30 players were used by Nelson throughout their 44 first-team matches. The majority of the championship-winning team remained with Nelson. New signings included defender Jack Newnes, who went on to become a Wales international, Billy Caulfield and Eddie Cameron. With 14 goals in 42 appearances, Joe Eddleston was the team's top goalscorer for the third season in succession, and also played the highest number of matches of all the first-team squad. The highest attendance of the season at the club's Seedhill stadium was 12,000 on two occasions, the first of these the opening day game against Clapton Orient on 26 August 1923. The lowest attendance in the league was 7,000 for three different matches, while the FA Cup replay against Wigan Borough attracted a crowd of only 4,000 spectators.", "|align=\"left\"|Eddie Cameron"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["Nelson began their league campaign on 30 August 1924 with an away match at Southport, who had ended the previous season in seventh position. New signings Billy Bottrill, Bill Ellerington and Joseph O'Beirne went straight into the starting line-up but they could not prevent Southport winning by a single goal from Jack Barber,  giving them their first ever League win against Nelson. A week later, Nelson played their first home game of the season, in which James Phizacklea made his debut for the club. A crowd of around 6,000 saw Ashington beaten 4\u20130 thanks to goals from Bottrill, Joe Eddleston, Jack Newnes and Sid Hoad. Three days later, Eddleston scored twice as Doncaster Rovers were defeated by three goals to nil in the first midweek match of the campaign. However, Nelson could not continue their winning streak as they lost 0\u20132 against Accrington Stanley at Peel Park in the following fixture. On 16 September, Nelson achieved their biggest victory in the Football League at that time with a 7\u20131 win over Durham City at Seedhill. The game saw Eddleston score his first hat-trick since the 3\u20130 victory away at Rochdale in January 1923, and O'Beirne and Eddie Cameron score their first goals of the season. Four days later, Nelson suffered their third consecutive defeat away from home, losing 0\u20133 to Barrow at Holker Street. The team continued their good home form the following week with a narrow win against Lincoln City. Nelson named the same team for the seventh game in succession for the trip to Tranmere Rovers on 4 October, but the side were beaten for the fourth straight away match thanks to goals from Dixie Dean and Jimmy Moreton.", "A week later Eddleston took his tally of goals to eight, scoring twice as Nelson overcame Walsall 2\u20131 at Seedhill. He scored again in the next match as the team gained their first point of the season away from home, drawing 1\u20131 at Wigan Borough, who had been Nelson's first ever opponents in the Football League over three years previously. Half-back Ernie Braidwood scored his first goal of the campaign in the 2\u20131 win against Halifax Town. Eddie Cameron also scored for the home side, and Walter Moore made his senior debut in the match. November began badly for Nelson as they suffered their heaviest defeat of the season, a 0\u20135 loss away at New Brighton. Allan Mathieson and Joe Wilcox scored two goals each as New Brighton won the first ever competitive meeting between the two sides. Nelson moved up to sixth place in the league following the next match, a 1\u20130 win at home to Grimsby Town. However, the team continued their poor form away from Seedhill, losing 1\u20133 to table-topping Darlington on 15 November. Seven days later, Bottrill scored the only goal of the match as Nelson beat Rochdale to record their eighth consecutive home win.", "Nelson entered the FA Cup, the foremost cup competition in England, in the Fifth Qualifying Round along with all the other teams in the Third Division North. For their first match, played on 29 November 1924, the team was drawn to play Winsford United of the Cheshire County League at Seedhill. Nelson won the first ever meeting between the two clubs 4\u20131 with goals from Braidwood, Eddleston, O'Beirne and Wolstenholme, to progress to the Sixth Qualifying Round for the first time in three years. In the next round Nelson were again given a home tie, against Second Division outfit Coventry City, who would be relegated to the Third Division North at the end of the 1924\u201325 campaign. Nelson made only one change from the side that had defeated Winsford, with Eddie Cameron replacing Arthur Wolstenholme. In front of a crowd of 7,000 spectators, one of the highest attendances at Seedhill of the season, Coventry won 1\u20130 to progress to the first round proper of the competition.Dykes (2009), p. 78", "|align=\"left\"|Eddie Cameron"]}]}}
