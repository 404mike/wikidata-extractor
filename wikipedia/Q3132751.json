He revived the local friendly society that had become moribund and founded another specifically for women. Duncan published a series of articles in the Dumfries and Galloway Courier, extolling the virtues of savings banks and proposing that one should be opened in every parish. However, despite the success of the friendly societies, Duncan was not convinced that their rules and regulations, were appropriate.  Earlier institutions had been charitable in status.  \u201cDr Duncan had the insight\u2026to see that if the institution was to be of a permanent character it must pay its way.\u201d  The Ruthwell was the first savings bank established on commercial principles. In May 1810 Henry Duncan duly opened the Ruthwell Savings Bank in the Friendly Society\u2019s rooms. John L Dinwiddie, The Ruthwell Cross and the Ruthwell Savings Bank, 2nd ed., 1933, Dumfries", "For all its early start, there is no evidence that the Ruthwell Savings Bank achieved much commercial success. The 1835 Scotland Act followed the English \u201cRose\u2019s Act\u201d enabling the Scottish savings banks to deposit funds with the British Government which led to a reorganisation of many of the leading banks. However, Ruthwell was one of a handful of Scottish savings banks that did not register under that Act.  It was also in 1835 that the Bank\u2019s deposits peaked at a very modest \u00a33,326. The Rev. Henry Duncan died in 1846.  Subsequently the establishment of savings banks in Dumfries and Annan reduced the need for a bank at Ruthwell and the number of customers dwindled. In 1875 the remaining 29 accounts, with deposits of just over \u00a3590, were transferred to Annan Savings Bank and the Ruthwell Savings Bank was wound up.
