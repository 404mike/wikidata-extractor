He made his senior debut in the last match of the 1900\u201301 Football League season, a 2\u20130 defeat away to Glossop in the Second Division. He became a regular member of the first team for the next five years; in April 1902, the Daily Express commented on how, despite the absence of Blow and fellow half-back Will Gibson, Lincoln \"pressed continuously during the first half\" and beat Bristol City 1\u20130. He scored just once in nationally organised competition, but did contribute the winning goal against Grimsby Town in the 1904 Lincolnshire Cup semi-final (Lincoln lost the final to Gainsborough Trinity). Blow's 180th and last appearance came in the penultimate game of the 1905\u201306 season, after which he returned to local non-league football."]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Sunderland A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Will Gibson"]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Sunderland A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Will Gibson"]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Sunderland A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Will Gibson"]}]}}
