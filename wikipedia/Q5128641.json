He has made it a habitable dwelling. The proportion of the great hall and state rooms are a mathematical paean.\"The Road to Oxiana, Robert Byron, Pimlico edition, 2004, page 4. The villa had indeed been vacated in the early 19th century, the surrounding stables and other buildings had fallen apart and were demolished by Austrian troops during the 1848 uprisings. At the end of the 19th century however, banker Baron Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Emile d'Erlanger, based in Paris and London, had found the house in the above described condition, then leased the villa from the Foscari family, and undertook some renovation work. Bertie Landsberg had purchased the villa in 1926, together with his friends Paul Rodocanachi and Catherine, Baroness d'Erlanger, the daughter-in-law of the former tenant. The new owners renovated the house and gardens and invited members of the high-society to lavish salons during summer seasons: choreographer Sergei Diaghilev, dancers Boris Kochno and Serge Lifar, writer Paul Morand, architect Le Corbusier, Winston Churchill, among others.A.

The hosts were the \"protagonists of a peculiar world, where the avant-guards, the lost aristocracies of the whole Europe, the revolutionaries and the dandies shared a considerable sense of freedom\". Bertie Landsberg, issue of an originally Jewish banking family, as the Erlangers, fled the Italian Fascists in 1939 and only returned to the villa in 1947. Kate d'Erlanger moved to Beverly Hills. In 1965 the English architect Claud Phillimore, 4th Baron Phillimore (1911\u20131994) inherited the villa from Landsberg. He began restoration, but sold the house in 1973 to count Antonio (\"Tonci\") Foscari (b. 1938), a descendant of the former owners and professor for architecture and preservation. He and his wife, Barbara del Vicario, undertook a painstaking process of restoring it to its original grandeur. In 2012, Foscari wrote of the villa's renaissance."]}, {"page": "Phillimore", "response": ["*Claud Phillimore, 4th Baron Phillimore (1911\u20131994), English architect"]}, {"page": "Claud", "response": ["*Claud Phillimore, 4th Baron Phillimore (1911\u20131994), English architect, 4th Baron Phillimore"]}, {"page": "Arthur Dorrien-Smith", "response": ["* Anne Elizabeth Dorrien-Smith (4 July 1911), married Claud Phillimore, 4th Baron Phillimore"]}, {"page": "Smith family (bankers)", "response": ["********  Anne Elizabeth Dorrien-Smith (born 1911), married Claud Phillimore, 4th Baron Phillimore"]}]}}
