A second consecutive All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed on 11 September 1960, with Down providing the opposition. The game was played on an even keel for much of the first-half; however, an important incident turned the game in the Ulster men's favour eleven minutes after the interval. Kevin Mussen's line ball found Dan McCartan who sent in a high forty-yard lob which Kerry goalkeeper Johnny Culloty dropped over the goal-line. Two minutes later Paddy Doherty was pulled down in the square. He converted the subsequent penalty which put Down six points up. An historic final score of 2\u201310 to 0\u20138 resulted in a defeat for O'Dwyer's side, while the Sam Maguire Cup crossed the border into Northern Ireland for the first time."]}, {"page": "Patrick Doherty", "response": ["Patrick or Paddy Doherty  may refer to:", "* Paddy Doherty (activist) (1926\u20132016), Northern Irish activist", "* Paddy Doherty (Gaelic footballer) (born 1934), Gaelic footballer", "* Paddy Doherty (TV personality) (born 1959), Irish Traveller and bare-knuckle boxer"]}, {"page": "Laochra Gael", "response": ["| 6 || 2 November 2004 || Paddy Doherty|| Down || Gaelic football"]}, {"page": "List of All-Ireland Senior Football Championship winning captains", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Paddy Doherty"]}, {"page": "All-Ireland Senior Football Championship records and statistics", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Paddy Doherty"]}, {"page": "1968 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship", "response": ["Down's Paddy Doherty was the championship's top scorer with 1-25.
