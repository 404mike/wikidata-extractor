He was shocked at the vast improvement in their playing and singing, and remembered Best's drumming to be very powerful, which pushed the group to play harder and louder. It was probably thanks to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he often told Best in Hamburg to \"crank it up\" (play as loud as possible). When the group returned to Hamburg, by which time McCartney had switched to bass, Best was asked to sing a speciality number written by McCartney, \"Pinwheel Twist\", while McCartney played drums, but he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage."]}, {"page": "The Beatles", "response": ["* Chas Newby\u00a0\u2013 bass (1960\u20131961)"]}, {"page": "Fifth Beatle", "response": ["===Chas Newby===", "When the Beatles returned from West Germany for the first time in 1960, they were short of a bass guitarist.
