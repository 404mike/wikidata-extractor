Oscar's mother, Jade Dixon-Halliday, betrayed M.I.9 for S.K.U.L. She appears to be a double agent, switching sides continuously to gain the advantage. Oscar seems very insecure about his mum, not wanting anybody to find out what she is like. He finds out his real name is Oscar Dixon-Halliday which is double-barrelled after both his parents. His name was changed to Oscar Cole by M.I.9 who wanted to protect his identity after his mother left to join S.K.U.L. In \"Return of the Mummy\", she is believed to be on S.K.U.L.'s side. Oscar's father, Edward Dixon-Halliday, went missing in action in a mission that he took up in Africa when Oscar was 4 and Oscar believed that he had died. However, as revealed in \"The Lost Hero\", is alive and was working as a mole in S.K.U.L. after taking 9 years to escape from Africa. It is also revealed that Oscar did not live with foster parents but instead an M.I.9 agent, who tried bonding with him but failed. Before it was revealed that Oscar's father was alive he was very close to Frank, much closer than Rose or Carrie. This is especially shown in \"Operation Flopsy\" when Oscar turned to Frank alone about S.K.U.L and his mother."]}, {"page": "The Secret of Eel Island", "response": ["*Ben Kerfoot as Malachite"]}, {"page": "Dixi (TV series)", "response": ["*Ben Kerfoot as Ash"]}]}}
