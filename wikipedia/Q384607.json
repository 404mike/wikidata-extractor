Andronicus Comnenius (1664), a blank verse tragedy, is based on the story of Andronicus Comnenus as told by Peter Heylin in his Cosmography. It contains a scene between the usurper and the widow of his victim Alexius which follows very closely Shakespeare's treatment of a parallel situation in Richard III. The Projectors (1665), a prose comedy of London life, is, like Moli\u00e8re's The Miser, founded on the Aulularia of Plautus, but there is no evidence that Wilson was acquainted with the French play. Belphegor, or the Marriage of the Devil; a Tragi-coniedy (1690), treats of a theme familiar to Elizabethan drama, but Wilson took the subject from the Belphegor attributed to Machiavelli, and alludes also to Straparola's version in the Notti.

As a result of the controversy, The Change of Crowns was not published in its own era."]}, {"page": "William Pinkethman", "response": ["Pinkethman overcame a weakness for overacting and playing to the crowd to become a steady performer. He is first heard of at the Theatre Royal, in 1692, in Thomas Shadwell's The Volunteers, in which he played Stitchum the tailor, an original part of six lines.He was then the original Porter in Thomas Southerne's Maid's Last Prayer, and in 1694, in Edward Ravenscroft's Canterbury Guests, or a Bargain Broken, he played Second Innkeeper and Jack Sawce. After the departure in 1695 of Thomas Betterton and his associates, Pinkethman was promoted to a better line of parts.In 1696,  he played Jaques in the Third Part of Don Quixote, by D'Urfey; Dr. Pulse in Delarivier Manley's Lost Lover; Pal\u00e6mon in Pausanias (Norton or Southerne); Sir Merlin Marteen in Afra Behn's Younger Brother, or the Amorous Jill; Nic Froth, an innkeeper, in The Cornish Comedy (George Powell); and Castillio, jun., in Neglected Virtue, or the Unhappy Conqueror (anonymous). Among his original parts, in 1697, were Tom Dawkins in Elkanah Settle's Man in the Moon, Amorous in Female Wits (Margaret Cavendish) in which also he appeared in his own character, Gusman in Triumphs of Virtue (anonymous), Major Rakish in Colley Cibber's Woman's Wit, Baldernoe in John Dennis's Plot and No Plot, First Tradesman, Quaint, and Sir Polidorus Hogstye in John Vanbrugh's \u00c6sop, and Famine in James Drake's Sham Lawyer. He also played the Lieutenant in the Humorous Lieutenant of Beaumont and Fletcher. Min Heer Tomas, a fat burgomaster, in D'Urfey's Campaigners, or Pleasant Adventures at Brussels, Snatchpenny in John Lacy's Sauny the Scot, or the Taming of the Shrew, and Pedro in Powell's Imposture Defeated were in 1698; and Club in George Farquhar's Love and a Bottle, Jonathan in Love without Interest, Beau Clincher in Farquhar's The Constant Couple, in 1699. In that year he recited the prologue to the first part of D'Urfey's Rise and Fall of Massaniello, and probably played in both parts of the play. He was in 1700 the Mad Taylor in a revival of The Pilgrim (John Fletcher with Vanburgh and Dryden), and played the first Dick Addle in Courtship \u00e0 la Mode, a play written by Crawford, and given, as were other comedies, to Pinkethman. Don Lewis in Love makes a Man, or the Fop's Fortune (Cibber's adaptation from Beaumont and Fletcher), Pun in Baker's The Humours of the Age, Clincher, the Jubilee Beau turned into a politician, in Sir Harry Wildair (Farquhar's sequel to the Constant Couple), Charles Codshead in D'Urfey's Bath, were in 1701. In 1702 he was the original Old Mirabel in George Farquhar's The Inconstant.Also Will Fanlove in William Burnaby's Modish Husband, Lopez in Vanbrugh's False Friend, Trim in Steele's Funeral, Trappanti in Cibber's She Would and She Would Not, and Subtleman in Farquhar's Twin Rivals. He also recited what was known as \"Pinkethman's Epilogue\". He was known for his ad libs.Playing Thomas Appletree in The Recruiting Officer, he was asked his name by Robert Wilks, as Captain Plume; he replied, \"Why, don't you know my name, Bob? I thought every fool had known that.\" \"Thomas Appletree\", whispered Wilks, in a rage. \"Thomas Appletree! Thomas Devil!\" said he; \"my name is Will Pinkethman\", and asked gallery if that were not the case. In the end he was hissed. It was at this period that Charles Gildon, in his Comparison between Two Stages, spoke of him as \"a fellow that overdoes everything, and spoils many a part with his own stuff.\""]}, {"page": "John Lacy", "response": ["John Lacy may refer to:", "*John Lacy (playwright) (c. 1615?\u20131681), an English actor and playwright", "*John Lacy (footballer) (born 1951), an English footballer"]}, {"page": "The Taming of the Shrew in performance", "response": ["The Taming of the Shrew in performance has had an uneven history. Popular in Shakespeare's day, the play fell out of favour during the seventeenth century, when it was replaced on the stage by John Lacy's Sauny the Scott. The original Shakespearean text was not performed at all during the eighteenth century, with David Garrick's adaptation Catharine and Petruchio dominating the stage. After over two hundred years without a performance, the play returned to the British stage in 1844, the last Shakespeare play restored to the repertory. However, it was only in the 1890s that the dominance of Catharine and Petruchio began to wain, and productions of The Shrew become more regular. Moving into the twentieth century, the play's popularity increased considerably, and it became one of Shakespeare's most frequently staged plays, with productions taking place all over the world. This trend has continued into the twenty-first century, with the play as popular now as it was when first written.", "Aside from the court performance, evidence of the play's stage history during the seventeenth century is relatively sparse. The title page of the 1631 quarto states the play had been acted by the King's Men at both the Globe and Blackfriars. The King's Men only began performing at Blackfriars in 1610, suggesting the play was still popular enough to be performed at least sixteen years after its debut. However, there is no further information available. Apart from a possible production at Drury Lane in 1663 or 1664, the play's place on the stage was taken by John Lacy's adaptation, Sauny the Scot at some point during the seventeenth century. The original play seems not to have been performed at all during the eighteenth century, and instead a range of adaptations held the stage, most notably David Garrick's 1754 adaptation, Catharine and Petruchio.", "During the 1660s, Shrew was adapted by John Lacy as Sauny the Scot, to make it better match with Fletcher's sequel. Originally performed under the Taming of the Shrew title, the play was published in 1698 as Sauny the Scot: or, The Taming of the Shrew: A Comedy. This version inconsistently anglicised the character names and recast the play in prose. Lacy also expanded the part of Grumio into the title role Sauny (who speaks in a heavy Scottish brogue), which he played himself. Sauny is an irreverent, cynical companion to Petruchio, and is comically terrified of his master's new bride. Lucentio was renamed Winlove, Baptista became Lord Beaufoy and Katherina was renamed Meg. In Sauny, Petruchio is much more vicious, threatening to whip Meg if she doesn't marry him, then telling everyone she is dead, and tying her to a bier. The play ends with her thoroughly tamed. Lacy's work premiered at Drury Lane in 1667, starring Susanna Verbruggen and George Powell. Samuel Pepys saw it on 9 April and again on 1 November, enjoying it on both occasions. The play was popular enough that it was still being performed as late as 1732, when it was staged at Goodman's Fields Theatre, and it seems to have supplanted Shrews place on the English stage for the rest of the seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth."]}, {"page": "Mary Willis", "response": ["* Biddy in The Old Troop by John Lacy (1717)"]}, {"page": "Margaret Mills (actress)", "response": ["* Bianca in Sauny the Scot by John Lacy (1707)"]}, {"page": "Love in the Dark (play)", "response": ["The original Drury Lane cast included Edward Lydall as Loredano, Nicholas Burt as Cardinal Colonna, William Cartwright as Hircanio, Philip Griffin as Grimani, William Wintershall as Cornanti, John Lacy as  Intrigo, Edward Kynaston as Count Sforza, Michael Mohun as Tribultio, Joseph Haines as  Visconti, Martin Powell as Proveditor, Elizabeth James as  Aurana and Elizabeth Boutell as Bellinganna.Van Lennep p.232"]}, {"page": "Love in a Wood (play)", "response": ["The original cast included Charles Hart as Ranger, Richard Bell as Vincent, Edward Kynaston as Valentine, John Lacy as Alderman Gripe, William Wintershall as Sir Simon Addleplot, Michael Mohun as Dapperwit, Elizabeth Boutell as Christina, Elizabeth Cox as Lydia, Mary Knep as  Lady Flippant, Katherine Corey as  Mrs Joyner and Elizabeth James as Isabel.
