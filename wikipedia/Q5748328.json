He was one of three brothers (Edward, Hew, and Robert) who all rose to command divisions or corps during the war.\nFanshawe joined the 19th Hussars in 1882, and after seeing active duty in North Africa became the aide-de-camp to Sir Evelyn Wood VC, a prominent senior officer; he would later marry Wood's eldest daughter. He served with his regiment during the Boer War, and then commanded a cavalry regiment, followed by brigades in the Home Forces and in India.\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War, Fanshawe commanded a cavalry division and then the Cavalry Corps in France, before assuming command of V Corps in late 1915. He was removed from command in mid-1916, however, as a result of political manoeuvring following the attempt to find a scapegoat for the failed Actions of St Eloi Craters in March 1916. He later commanded the 18th Indian Division in Mesopotamia and was with it at the end of the war in the Middle East. He retired from the Army in 1920, and served as the ceremonial colonel of the Queen's Bays.", "link_mentions": {}}}
