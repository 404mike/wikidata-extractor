After trialling Bill Athey behind the wicket, New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney permitted Taylor to come on the field to keep for the remainder of the day.

Despite having retired from first-class cricket two years earlier, Taylor ... kept without a blemish.\" Bobby Parks was brought in to keep for the following day. Also in 1986, Taylor was selected as part of Brian Close's invitational XI to play New Zealand at Scarborough on 31 August. Taylor kept wicket, and scored 21 as well as taking two catches.

McCorkell passed the benchmark '1000 runs in a season' 9 times, a feat Aymes failed to match.

By chance, former England wicket-keeper Bob Taylor, who had retired from first-class cricket, was in the hospitality tent.
