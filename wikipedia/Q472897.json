Though originally ordained within the Church of Scotland, Newbigin spent much of his career serving as a missionary in India and became affiliated with the Church of South India and the United Reformed Church, becoming one of the Church of South India's first bishops. A prolific author who wrote on a wide range of theological topics, Newbigin is best known for his contributions to missiology and ecclesiology. He is also known for his involvement in both the dialogue regarding ecumenism and the Gospel and Our Culture movement. Many scholars also believe his work laid the foundations for the contemporary missional church movement, and it is said his stature and range is comparable to the \"Fathers of the Church\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queens' College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Lesslie Newbigin"]}, {"page": "World Student Christian Federation", "response": ["* Bishop Lesslie Newbigin"]}, {"page": "Westminster College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Lesslie Newbigin, ecumenist, bishop, scholar and pioneer of the Church of South India"]}, {"page": "Madras Christian College", "response": ["In 1938 MCC hosted the Tambaram Conference (also called The Madras Conference or Tambaram 1938), the third World Missionary Conference which eventually created the World Council of Churches.

To matriculate, Bennett spent his first year obtaining a Certificate in Biblical Knowledge from the University and two 'A levels' (in Religious Studies and British Constitution and Politics) from the Joint Matriculation Board (JMB). At University Bennett was politically active through the Liberal Society. He was Treasurer of the Baptist-United Reformed Church Society, served on the Chaplaincy committee and as Secretary of the Theological Society. In this capacity, he invited such theologians as Maurice Wiles, I. Howard Marshall, Morna Hooker and others to address the Society, whose members included Faculty alongside students. For the last six months of his final year he was Baptist Student Leader at the College (where Methodists were also training for ministry). He graduated in July 1978 and was ordained as a minister of the Baptist Union of Great Britain the same month. Accepted for service with the Baptist Missionary Society, Bennett spent an academic year at the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham where he undertook missionary orientation.  He was most influenced by Lesslie Newbigin, who taught missiology.Bennett was to work with Newbigin on various committees of the Birmingham Council of Christian Churches between 1983 and 1992.  Newbigin was a Vice-President. In July 1979, Bennett obtained a Certificate in the Study of Islam from the University of Birmingham through the Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations before proceeding to Bangladesh, where he remained until 1982 engaged in pastoral care and distance education teaching as a tutor for the College of Christian Theology Bangladesh (CCTB).  He passed the Junior and Senior level Bengali examinations of the Bangladesh Language Examination Board.  Although he completed several units of a master's degree by distance learning from Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, CA he was unable to complete the residential component because of the cost. When the BMS chose not to support his plan to enroll for an MA at a College in Bangladesh, he returned to Birmingham, graduating MA in 1985 and PhD in 1990. Both research degrees were in Islamic Studies under the supervision of David Kerr and Christian W. Troll, SJ. His external examiners were Jan Slomp and Clifford Edmund Bosworth.  Bennett's doctoral thesis was subsequently published as Victorian Images of Islam (1992) (in the CSIC Studies on Islam and Christianity series). In 1985, Bennett also passed the Bengali 'O Level' (London) achieving an 'A' grade. In 1996, Bennett graduated from the University of Oxford with the MEd through Westminster College, Oxford where he was teaching at the time.
