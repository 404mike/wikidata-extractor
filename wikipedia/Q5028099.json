Another 1 Squadron Nieuport followed on 7 May. On 25 May, he shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2d from No. 20 Squadron RFC piloted by eventual 11-kill ace Lt. Campbell Hoy who was injured. He was awarded Germany's highest decoration for enlisted men, the Military Merit Cross, on 28 June 1917.Note: It was highly irregular under German regulations to award higher decorations without first awarding both classes of the Iron Cross. It is a safe assumption Hanko won such, though no source refers to them."]}, {"page": "Richard M.
