He was born in London and died at Great Malvern, Worcestershire.\nThomas was educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a batsman, sometimes used as an opener, and there is no evidence that he bowled in first-class cricket, though the full details of the matches in which he played have not survived. It is not known whether he batted right- or left-handed. He played in two matches in each of the 1837 and 1838 seasons that have since been designated as first-class; his final game was the 1838 University Match against Oxford University, in which he scored 6 and 3 not out.Thomas graduated from Cambridge University in 1839 with a Bachelor of Arts degree which automatically converted to a Master of Arts in 1842. He was ordained as a Church of England deacon in 1840 and as a priest the following year. He was successively a curate at Eastergate, West Sussex and then Whaddon and Shepreth in Cambridgeshire before becoming priest-in-charge at Milford, Surrey, from 1846. In 1848, he became vicar at Rottingdean, East Sussex and remained there for the rest of his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Thomas", "response": ["Arthur Thomas may refer to:", "* Arthur Thomas (Cambridge University cricketer) (1816\u20131895), English cricketer", "* Arthur Thomas (baseball) (1864\u20131895), African-American baseball catcher and first baseman", "* Arthur Thomas (Australian cricketer) (1869\u20131934), Australian cricketer", "* Arthur Thomas (Glamorgan cricketer) (1895\u20131953), Welsh cricketer", "* Arthur Thomas (New Zealand cricketer) (1881\u20131965), New Zealand cricketer", "* Arthur Thomas (rugby league) (1901\u20131970), of the 1920s and '30s for Great Britain, England, Leeds, and York", "* Arthur Thomas (footballer) (1938\u20132007), for Linfield F.C. from Ballymena United F.C. in November 1965", "* Arthur Thomas (Emmerdale), fictional character on the British soap opera Emmerdale"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Arthur Thomas"]}, {"page": "Arthur Thomas (cricketer, born 1816)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Thomas (Cambridge University cricketer)"]}]}}
