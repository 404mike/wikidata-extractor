Before this move, however, original guitar player John Reese and Davey WIlliams on drums departed from the band. The band became a trio and remained that way until 1982 when Vance Bockis and later Norman Lawson joined the band. During this time they released the Sodden Jackal EP (spring 1983) and had one track (\"Concrete Cancer\") featured on Metal Blade's Metal Massacre VI. The Obsessed also managed to record their debut album in 1985 for Metal Blade, but it never officially surfaced."]}, {"page": "2011 in association football", "response": ["* 25 September \u2013 Norman Lawson English footballer"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2011", "response": ["*Norman Lawson, 75, English footballer and cricketer."]}, {"page": "Wendell Morgan", "response": ["Morgan returned home to West Glamorgan to sign for Second Division club Swansea Town for a \u00a35,000 fee in July 1958.
