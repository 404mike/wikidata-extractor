He was born in 1888, the second son of Arthur O'Connor of Elm Hall, Celbridge, County Kildare (1834\u20131907) and his second wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Saul). He was educated at Blackrock College, County Dublin. He obtained the dispensation which was at that time required by Catholics in order to study engineering at the then almost exclusively Protestant Trinity College, Dublin, from which he duly graduated in 1911.\nO'Connor was elected Sinn F\u00e9in MP for Kildare South at the 1918 general election. In January 1919 Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918, refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled as a unicameral revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  In the 1st D\u00e1il, he was appointed Substitute Director of Agriculture during the absence of Robert Barton. In the 2nd D\u00e1il he held the position of Minister of Agriculture from 26 August 1921 to 9 January 1922. O'Connor subsequently opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and joined the Republican side. In March 1926, O\u2019Connor became titular President of the Republic when \u00c9amon de Valera resigned. He later resigned the presidency in 1927. He lost his D\u00e1il seat in the 1923 general election and failed to be elected again in 1927. He retired from politics, returned to Trinity College Dublin to study law, after graduating in law he was called to the bar, subsequently appointed as Senior Counsel, eventually being appointed Circuit Judge for Cork city.\nHe never married and died suddenly at his family home, Elm Hall, in 1950, and is buried in Donacomper Cemetery, Celbridge. His brothers were also involved in the Irish Republican movement and his sister Fanny was a member of Cumann na mBan. His brother Daniel was the State Solicitor for Kildare. He was a first cousin of Seamus O'Connor, a Dublin solicitor who was also involved in the Irish Republican movement (one of those who met at Wynns Hotel, Dublin on 11 November 1913 to found the Irish Volunteers) and who was later appointed the Sheriff of the City of Dublin.", "link_mentions": {}}}
