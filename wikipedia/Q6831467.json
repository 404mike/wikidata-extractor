He appeared on their debut album Adventures in Clubland (1981) and on two further albums: Trick of the Light (1983) and Party Tonight (1983). He is probably best remembered as playing the trumpet solo on the Modern Romance cover version of Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White) which made the UK top twenty in 1982. The B-side to Cherry Pink ... is dedicated to Du Prez, a (nearly) instrumental track titled Who Is John Du Prez?. Modern Romance scored seven further Top Forty hits before disbanding in 1985, including Best Years of Our Lives (Songs) which reached #4 on the UK chart and later featured in the movie Shrek.

Their album, Adventures in Clubland, hit the #1 spot - and went Gold - in South America, and produced three UK hits (Everybody Salsa #12, Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey #10, and Queen of the Rapping Scene / Nothing Ever Goes the Way You Plan #37); the single Can You Move also peaked at #2 on the US Dance chart. Following a change in lead vocalist - from Geoff Deane to Michael J. Mullins - Modern Romance enjoyed what would be their watershed year, 1983. They made a significant dent in the UK charts with the following singles: Best Years of Our Lives #4, High Life #8, Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm #14, Walking in the Rain #7, and Good Friday #96. Two albums - a studio album and a Christmas compilation - also made the UK album charts that year: Trick of the Light (album) #53 and Party Tonight #45. Du Prez's trumpets and horns featured on nearly every track, from the party songs Best Years of Our Lives and High Life to the salsa tunes Everybody Salsa and Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey to the band's bluesy and soulful ballads like Walking in the Rain, the latter UK top ten hit also reaching #1 in Thailand. He also played on the band's cover version of Band of Gold (Freda Payne song) (1983). Du Prez left Modern Romance before they called it quits in 1985, but his trumpets sounds could be heard on their farewell single, Best Mix of Our Lives (1985), their last chart entry (#81).Modern Romance Official Website, [accessed] 25 April 2011.Lee-Williams, Matt: Jaymes, David, Internet Movie Database Biography, [accessed] 25 April 2011.Modern Romance, Discography, Disgcogs.com., Website, [accessed] 25 April 2011."]}, {"page": "Peter Howarth", "response": ["Peter Howarth co-wrote the West End musical, Robin, Prince of Sherwood, with 10cc guitarist Rick Fenn, which was commissioned and produced by Bill Kenwright.
