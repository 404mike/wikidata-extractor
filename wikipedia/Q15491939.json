At the same time, Gilli Smyth formed Mother Gong with English guitarist/producer Harry Williamson and Didier Malherbe, and played in Spain and England. Allen delighted in this proliferation of groups and considered his role at this time to be that of an instigator, traveling around the world leaving active Gong-related bands in his wake.", "After spending most of the Eighties in his native Australia, Allen returned to the UK in 1988 with a new project, The Invisible Opera Company of Tibet, whose revolving cast included violinist Graham Clark and Gong saxophonist Didier Malherbe. This morphed into Gongmaison in 1989, which added Harry Williamson from Mother Gong and had a techno-influenced sound with electronic beats, as well as live percussion from Shyamal Ma\u00eftra. In 1990, the Gong name was revived for a one-off U.K. T.V. appearance with a line-up featuring Allen, Smyth and Malherbe, plus early 70s drummer Pip Pyle and three members of Here & Now (band): Stephen Lewry (lead guitar), Keith Bailey (bass) and Paul Noble (synth). In April 1992, Gongmaison became Gong permanently with the combined line-up of Allen, Malherbe, Bailey and Pyle, plus Graham Clark and Shyamal Ma\u00eftra from Gongmaison. Together they recorded the album Shapeshifter (subsequently dubbed Radio Gnome Invisible, Part 4) and toured extensively."]}, {"page": "Henry Williamson", "response": ["After the war the family left the farm. In 1946 Williamson went to live alone at Ox's Cross, Georgeham in North Devon, where he built a small house in which to write. In 1947 Henry and Loetitia divorced. Williamson fell in love with a young teacher, Christine Duffield, and they were married in 1949. He began to write his series of fifteen novels collectively known as A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight. In 1950, the year his only child by this marriage Harry Williamson was born, he edited a collection of poems and short stories by James Farrar, a promising young poet who had died, at the age of 20, in the Second World War. From 1951 to 1969 Williamson produced almost one novel a year, while contributing regularly to the Sunday Express and The European magazine, edited by Diana Mosley. He also contributed a number of reviews and articles to The Sunday Times."]}, {"page": "Anthony Phillips", "response": ["After leaving Genesis, Phillips studied classical music (especially classical guitar) and made recordings in collaboration with Harry Williamson, Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins, among others. His first solo album, The Geese & the Ghost, was issued in 1977.", "Since leaving Genesis, Phillips has remained continuously involved in a variety of musical projects, including extensive soundtrack work in England, often for the label Atmosphere, part of the Universal Music Group. In 1988 he recorded an album with Harry Williamson called Tarka. The album's cover featured a picture of a woman and did not credit Phillips or Williamson anywhere on it, which led to it often being filed under \"female vocalist\" in record shops. In the mid-1990s, he released an album entitled The Living Room Concert, which featured solo acoustic versions of his earlier material. He also provided archival material for the first Genesis box set, Genesis Archive 1967\u201375, released in 1998."]}, {"page": "Nik Turner", "response": ["After his first departure from Hawkwind, Turner holidayed in Egypt and while visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza he was given three hours inside the King's Chamber to record some flute music.

The album was released as Xitintoday on Charisma records in 1978 and the band toured, played festivals including Deeply Vale Festivals (later released as a CD), Glastonbury Festival (part of which was broadcast BBC television) and his own themed Bohemian Love-In all day festival at the Roundhouse."]}, {"page": "Inner City Unit", "response": ["In 1977, after Nik Turner had been dismissed from Hawkwind, he traveled to Egypt and made some portable recordings playing flute in the King's Chamber of Great Pyramid of Giza.

He is credited as the album's co-producer with duties also completed by Harry Williamson. The earliest pieces were put down on a Revox 2-track tape machine before Phillips installed a TEAC 4-track with added Dolby noise reduction. The 12-string guitar played on the album was built by Rivers Jobe, one of Phillips's former school bandmates in Anon. In a 2014 interview, Phillips revealed that a radio broadcast can be heard in the background in the opening of one of the album's tracks. After completing the initial mixes himself, problems arose when Phillips handed the completed tracks to Ray Staff for mastering at London's Trident Studios as his inexperience had caused numerous technical errors which Staff had to correct.", "\"Beauty and the Beast\" is a piano piece that was recorded in 1972, the first of two pieces on the album recorded that year, and inspired upon Phillips hearing one of Chopin's piano nocturnes. It features Phillips on piano, a pin piano, an acoustic classical guitar. Phillips noted the track was recorded in four hours, and developed at a time when he experimented his technique such as playing at different speeds. It was recorded in \"fake stereo\" as he flipped from one track to another during the piece, resulting in the two tracks running slightly out of sync, but it ended up \"too fast not to matter\". \"Field of Eternity\" is a classical guitar piece written in 1972, credited to Phillips and his former Genesis bandmate Mike Rutherford. It is based on what Phillips described as a \"massive, straggly\" composition of the same name, and contains themes from a section of \"Flamingo\" that was ultimately discarded and a small section of an unrecorded Genesis song from the band's early years. It was not recorded until 1976. Following the release of the Genesis Archive 1967\u201375 (1998) box set, it became clear that the Genesis song in question was \"Pacidy\". \"Tibetan Yak-Music\" was recorded on a 12-string guitar with unconventional tuning accompanied by what Phillips described as \"graphics\" from Williamson who created vocal-like effects at the end of the piece, and changed the graphic equalisation on the guitar track so it changes in timbre multiple times. Phillips described the track as \"virtually improvised\". It originated from sessions with Harry Williamson in early 1976 that were scheduled for a television soundtrack based on Tarka the Otter. \"Lullaby\u2013Old Father Time\" is performed on four guitars: one acoustic 12-string, two acoustic 6-strings, and one electric guitar. \"Harmonium in the Dust (or Harmonious Stratosphere)\" features Phillips playing a harmonium and Fender Stratocaster. He did not own a synthesiser at the time of recording, so he used a harmonium as it could make a sustained note. \"Tregenna Afternoons\" is the second track on the album composed in 1972. It takes its name from Phillips's time at Tregenna Castle in Cornwall that overlooks St Ives Bay. Phillips wrote \"Reaper\" in 1970, shortly after his departure from Genesis, and wrote \"Autumnal\" in 1972. \"Flamingo\" is the first movement to a proposed 12-string guitar concerto.", "*Harry Williamson \u2013 production (\"Tibetan Yak-Music\" only)"]}, {"page": "Xitintoday", "response": ["*Harry Williamson - guitars, vocals, keyboards"]}, {"page": "Tarka the Otter (film)", "response": ["In 1976 Anthony Phillips, formerly a guitarist with Genesis, and Harry Williamson had recorded a soundtrack to the film  with the support of David Cobham, the producer.

Once Phillips had gained some momentum, he recalled that \"working on a big canvas\" once more was an exciting one and felt particularly inspired from the frustration in not having been able to have an outlet for the larger scale ideas he had accumulated. Phillips's enthusiasm for the project resulted in four long pieces outlined in two months: one each based on the piano and 12-string guitar, and two of varied styles and arrangements which he thought resembled a film soundtrack. He opted to develop the latter two, keeping the material that he felt had \"more change, more dynamics, more spacey\". Phillips also felt encouraged to produce a large scale work to demonstrate to others that he could score full length films."]}, {"page": "Harry Williamson", "response": ["Harry Williamson may refer to:", "* Harry Williamson (athlete) (1913\u20132000), American middle-distance runner", "* Harry Williamson (musician) (born 1950), British musician, member of Ant-Bee"]}, {"page": "Gooseberry Sound Studios", "response": ["*Tarka \u2013 Anthony Phillips & Harry Williamson (not all tracks) (1988)"]}, {"page": "Exeter Cathedral School", "response": ["* Harry Williamson, musicianDaniel Farson,  Henry, an Appreciation of Henry Williamson (M.
