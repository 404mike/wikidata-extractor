His regular position was at inside right.\nBorn in Manchester, Doherty started his professional career with Manchester United in 1952. He was part of the United squad that won the 1955\u201356 league title and scored seven goals in 26 appearances. In October 1957, he was transferred to Leicester City for \u00a36,500. His exit from Old Trafford came just before eight of his United colleagues lost their lives in the Munich air disaster; he was in a Leicester hospital undergoing surgery for a knee injury when he heard the news.\nHe left Leicester after only one season due to his knee related problems, before moving on to Rugby Town, and then to Altrincham.\nIn the autumn of 1958, when Arsenal made an offer to Manchester United assistant manager Jimmy Murphy to become their new manager, Murphy offered Doherty the chance to become his assistant if he took charge at the North London club. However, Murphy then decided against moving to Arsenal and the partnership never happened\nAs of 2006, John was chairman of the Former Manchester United Players Association and co-authored the book The Insider's Guide to Manchester United with Ivan Ponting, where he gave his opinion of over 300 United players (including himself) since 1950. He was the driving force behind a friendly match at Old Trafford in 1998 to raise money for the families of the Munich victims on the disaster's 40th anniversary.Doherty died of lung cancer in November 2007 at the age of 72.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 13", "response": ["*  2007   \u2013 John Doherty, English footballer and manager (b. 1935)"]}, {"page": "Munich air disaster", "response": ["In late 1997, John Doherty (a former United player who had left the club shortly before the disaster) approached club chairman Martin Edwards on behalf of the Manchester United Former Players' Association to request a testimonial for those victims of the Munich disaster \u2013 both the survivors and the dependants of the ones who were lost.Morrin, pp. 201\u2013202.

He covered in goal in the 1957 FA Cup Final while Ray Wood received treatment for an injury suffered in a collision with Peter McParland, who scored both of Aston Villa's goals as United lost 2\u20131.

Wilf McGuinness suffered a broken leg in a reserve match during the 1959\u201360 season and never returned to the first team, although he stayed with the club as a member of the coaching staff and spent 18 months as United's manager after the retirement of Sir Matt Busby in May 1969.
