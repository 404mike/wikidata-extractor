It consisted of business people and professionals who endorsed democratic ideals but wanted to keep their distance from the United Democrats of Hong Kong, formed in 1990 by the pro-democratic activists. The HKDF had four seats in the Legislative Council when it was founded: Mr Jimmy McGregor, Dr Leong Che-hung, Ms Leung Wai-tung and Mr Chan Ying-lun. Dr C.H.Leong chaired the HKDF when it was founded but the chairmanship was soon passed on to another medical doctor, Dr Patrick Shiu Kin-ying in April 1992, who served as HKDF's second chairman until 1997. The HKDF contested the first legislative council direct election in 1991 but won two seats. Dr C.H.Leong later left the HKDF to join Meeting Point, which later merged with the United Democrats of Hong Kong to form the pro-democracy flagship party Democratic Party, but Dr C.H.
