He spent his childhood mostly in Poole, Dorset, where his aunt, Susan Bell, taught him to draw and introduced him to zoology. She had similarly taught her own son, Thomas Bell, who was twenty years older and later became a great friend to Gosse.", "Returning to England in 1839, Gosse was hard pressed to make a living, subsisting on eightpence a day (\"one herring eaten as slowly as possible, and a little bread\"). His fortunes began to improve when John Van Voorst, the leading publisher of naturalist writing, agreed, on the recommendation of Thomas Bell, to publish his Canadian Naturalist (1840).. In his son's telling, Gosse \"broke down utterly into hysterical sob upon sob, while Mr. Van Voorst, murmuring, 'My dear young man! my dear young man!' hastened out to fetch wine and minister to wants which it was beyond the power of pride to conceal any longer.\" Edmund Gosse, Life of Philip Henry Gosse (1890), 157. The book, set as a conversation between a father and his son (a son Gosse did not yet have), was widely praised.

Most recently, it was included in the genus Triturus, along with most European newts. This genus however was found to be polyphyletic, containing several unrelated lineages, and the small-bodied newts, including the smooth newt, were therefore split off as separate genus in 2004 by Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds and colleagues. They used the name Lissotriton, introduced by the English zoologist Thomas Bell in 1839 with the smooth newt as type species but then considered a synonym of Triturus. \"Lissotriton\" is a combination of the Greek  (), meaning \"smooth\", and the name of Triton, an ancient Greek god of the sea, while the species epithet  means \"common\" in Latin."]}, {"page": "Palmate newt", "response": ["The palmate newt was first described scientifically in 1789, by Russian naturalist Grigory Razumovsky.

He also gave Lacerta paradoxa as alternative name, which is today regarded as a junior synonym. Several names published over time, in different genera, are also now treated as synonyms for the palmate newt.

Frederick Newland-Pedley, who was appointed assistant dental surgeon at Guy\u2019s Hospital in 1885, advocated the establishment of a dental school within the hospital, and he flooded the two dental schools in London, the Metropolitan School of Dental Science and the London School of Dental Surgery, with patients to prove that a further hospital was needed. In December 1888, Guy\u2019s Hospital Dental School was established. Guy\u2019s Hospital Dental School was recognised as a school of the University of London in 1901. In the 1970s, since there was a decline in the demand for dental services, the Department of Health of the UK suggested that there should be a decrease in the number of dental undergraduate students as well as the duration of all courses.

Initially, all extant horseshoe bats were in Rhinolophus, as well as the species now in Hipposideros (roundleaf bats). At first, Rhinolophus was within the family Vespertilionidae. In 1825, British zoologist John Edward Gray subdivided Vespertilionidae into subfamilies, including what he called Rhinolophina. English zoologist Thomas Bell is credited as the first to recognize horseshoe bats as a separate family, using Rhinolophidae in 1836. While Bell is sometimes recognized as the authority for Rhinolophidae, the authority is more often given as Gray, 1825. Horseshoe bats are in the superfamily Rhinolophoidea, along with Craseonycteridae, Hipposideridae Megadermatidae, Rhinonycteridae, and Rhinopomatidae."]}, {"page": "On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection", "response": ["The papers were read to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858, by the Secretary John Joseph Bennett.

His collections of illustrations were used by zoologists like J. E. Gray.

Gray described and named many of the species in the work except for some of the testudines which were named on the basis of the manuscripts of Thomas Bell. Some drawings of shells and plants which were part of the collections he bequeathed were probably made by his sister.

At the meeting the Secretary read the papers out, before going on to six other papers, and there was no discussion of them at the end of the meeting, perhaps because of the amount of business that had been dealt with including an obituary notice for Robert Brown given by Lyell, or possibly due to reluctance to speak out against a theory supported by the eminent Lyell and Hooker. Thomas Bell, who had written up the description of Darwin's reptile specimens from the Beagle expedition, presided over the meeting.
