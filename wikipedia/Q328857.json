He told Bogdanovich that he used the theme in both films to evoke repressed desire and lost love.  The film scholar Kathryn Kalinak notes that Ann Rutledge's theme \"encodes longing\" and \"fleshes out the failed love affair between Hallie and Tom Doniphon, the growing love between Hallie and Ranse Stoddard, and the traumatic loss experienced by Hallie over her choice of one over the other, none of which is clearly articulated by dialogue.\".
