He made 589 league and cup appearances in a 19-year career as a professional in the English Football League, and then took charge of a further 469 matches as a manager.\nA goalkeeper, he began his career at hometown club Sheffield Wednesday, winning the club's Player of the Year award in his debut season in 1977\u201378. He then won a place on the PFA Team of the Year the following season, and also played on loan at Lincoln City, before being sold to Sunderland for \u00a380,000 in July 1979. He helped Sunderland to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1979\u201380, and in 1985 played on the losing side in the League Cup final, before he was named as the club's Player of the Year. He was signed by Manchester United for a \u00a3275,000 fee in July 1985. He was sold back to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3175,000 in September 1988. He briefly played on loan at Leeds United the following year. He helped Wednesday to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1990\u201391, and kept a clean sheet against former club Manchester United as Wednesday won the League Cup in 1991. He was moved on to Leyton Orient for \u00a375,000 in 1991, and again named on the PFA Team of the Year in 1991\u201392.\nHe began his managerial career at Leyton Orient in August 1994, working alongside John Sitton. The pair were sacked in April 1995, and he coached at Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, before being appointed manager at Hartlepool United in February 1999. He turned the club from relegation candidates to consistent play-off challengers, and was lured to Sheffield Wednesday in November 2002. He lasted 22 months in the job, before he was sacked in September 2004. He took charge at Stockport County three months later, but was again unsuccessful, and left the club by mutual consent in December 2005. He returned to Hartlepool United as Director of Sport in February 2006, before being named as first-team manager in December 2008. He resigned in August 2010, and went on to work behind the scenes at Chesterfield, Port Vale and Wakefield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["His priority in summer 1978 was to find a target man for Tommy Tynan to play alongside and he found it in  Andrew McCulloch, who arrived from Brentford for a \u00a370,000 fee. He signed Terry Curran as a winger but eventually moved him up front to play alongside McCulloch. He sold goalkeeper Chris Turner to Sunderland and replaced him with the bigger Bob Bolder. He further raised the average height of the team by signing uncompromising centre-half Mick Pickering from Southampton. The team failed to advance in the league, finishing the 1978\u201379 season again in 14th spot. They did make their mark on the FA Cup in the Third Round by taking eventual winners Arsenal to four replays before they eventually succumbed to a 2\u20130 defeat."]}, {"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["Matters came to a head in 1998\u201399; Tait's side were struggling, and even the signing of former England international Peter Beardsley had not changed the club's fortunes. Tait was sacked in January 1999, and Chris Turner was appointed; despite being four points adrift at the bottom of the League at Easter, Turner was able to prevent the club being relegated. Under Turner, matters improved drastically. In 1999\u20132000 they reached the play-offs, but were beaten by local rivals Darlington in the semi-finals. Pools qualified for the play-offs for the next two seasons as well \u2013 though on both occasions they were defeated in the semi-finals by Blackpool and Cheltenham Town respectively.", "The 2005\u201306 season saw the side slip down the division to the relegation places helped in part by poor management, an indecisive board room and key player injuries. Manager Martin Scott was suspended after an alleged fight with a player in the changing rooms, which resulted in his dismissal. Youth team coach Paul Stephenson was put in charge until the end of the season, aided by former manager Chris Turner who returned to the club as Director of Sport, and despite remaining undefeated in his first five games in charge, he could not prevent the club being relegated into the fourth tier in May 2006. Some felt that Hartlepool's relegation was unfair given that Rotherham United had escaped administration, and therefore a 10-point deduction and relegation, by delaying a CVA meeting until after the season had ended.", "They maintained their League One status by finishing 15th in the 2007\u201308 season. In December 2008, Danny Wilson was sacked; while the club were unbeaten in four games and well clear of the relegation zone, the board felt that Wilson could take the club no further. Chris Turner was quickly returned to the managerial position, combining the role with his existing position as the club's Director of Sport. In the 2008\u201309 season, Hartlepool celebrated their centenary season with a run in the FA Cup and League Cup: beating Premier League sides Stoke City and West Brom respectively. Pools went into the final round of fixtures with a three-point cushion and six goal buffer over the relegation zone. They were beaten 4\u20131 by Bristol Rovers but survived after Northampton Town lost 3\u20130 at Leeds United.", "Chris Turner resigned from the club a few weeks into the following season and Mick Wadsworth took over on a temporary basis, before being appointed permanently a month later. The 2010\u201311 season ended up going much the same as the previous one, with the club in play-off contention in the middle of the campaign before falling away as the season went on. However, the drop in Hartlepool's form was not as severe as it had been in the previous two seasons, and they finished in 16th place, well clear of the relegation zone. The club started the following 2011\u201312 season well, and were 3rd going into October, but a bad run of form resulted in the sacking of Wadsworth in December, with former manager Neale Cooper returning to the club as his replacement. While Cooper was not able to get the club back to their early form, the side stayed generally consistent for the remainder of the season and secured a 13th-place finish, the highest the club had achieved since the play-off campaign in 2005."]}, {"page": "Chris Marsden", "response": ["After a short and unsuccessful spell at Busan I'Park, Marsden was snapped up on a free transfer by Chris Turner for Sheffield Wednesday. However, his career was cut short by a hamstring injury that forced him to retire."]}, {"page": "Newbottle, Tyne and Wear", "response": ["People to have lived in the village include footballers David Meyler, Chris Turner, Thomas Sorensen and Colin Todd, and singer Bryan Ferry."]}, {"page": "Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)", "response": ["He left Hartlepool United on 15 December 2008, leaving Chris Turner in temporary charge."]}, {"page": "Jim Gannon", "response": ["In November 2005, Gannon was appointed as director of Stockport County's centre of excellence for girls. After the resignation of Chris Turner as Stockport County manager on Boxing Day 2005, Gannon was appointed as caretaker manager with the team nine points adrift of safety at the bottom of League Two, facing potential relegation from the Football League.", "County finished the 2007\u201308 season fourth in the league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2\u20131 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3\u20132 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself as one of the most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for \u00a3750,000 \u2013 a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous."]}]}}
