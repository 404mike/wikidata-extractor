He was born in Tonbridge and died in Chester, Nova Scotia. His elder brother, Claude Woolley, played for Northamptonshire.A genuine all-rounder, Woolley was a left-handed batsman and a left-arm bowler who varied his style between left-arm orthodox spin and left-arm medium pace. He was an outstanding fielder close to the wicket, generally at first slip, and is the only player other than wicketkeepers to hold over 1,000 catches in a first-class career. He represented England in 64 Test matches from 1909 to 1934. Woolley is generally regarded as one of cricket's greatest-ever all-rounders. His first-class career runs total is the second highest of all time, after Jack Hobbs, and he scored the seventh highest number of career centuries. His career total of wickets taken is the 27th highest. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1911 edition.In 2009, Woolley was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": {}}}
