Following the Paris gala, Blair was asked, as representative of the Association of Artists Against Aids to organise a Royal Gala at the Drury Lane Theatre benefit for the National Aids Trust. Blair devoted the gala to the music of Stephen Sondheim, who attended as guest of honour. The show, named \"Being Alive\", featured international artists, film stars, musicians, TV personalities, opera singers and conductors and raised substantial funds for the Milestone Aids Hospice in Edinburgh. Blair subsequently organised five other major fundraisers and the recording of An Anthology of English Song by major artists from the Royal Opera House to support the Milestone Aids Hospice. Blair also raised funds for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital and for Queen Charlotte's Children's Hospital, serving for three years (one as vice-president) on the organising committee for the Queen Charlotte's Birthday Ball."]}, {"page": "June Gordon", "response": ["#REDIRECT June Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair"]}, {"page": "June Boissier", "response": ["#REDIRECT June Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2009", "response": ["*June Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, 95, British musician and patron of the arts.Obituary: June, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair"]}, {"page": "Boissier", "response": ["* June Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, born Beatrice Mary June Boissier"]}]}}
