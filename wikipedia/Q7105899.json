An innovator in the early development of professional training for teachers, he served as principal of the Cambridge University Day Training College (CUDTC) from 1891 to 1909. He was also a prolific author of popular histories and other books.\nThe son of a prosperous distiller, Browning was educated at Eton, and then King's College, Cambridge. On graduating in 1860 he returned to Eton as an assistant master. A vociferous and active opponent of the school's traditional curriculum and teaching methods, he introduced novel and progressive techniques to the classroom, to the general approval of his pupils but to the dismay of the Eton authorities. He was controversially dismissed from his post in 1875, ostensibly because of repeated disregard for school rules, but an underlying issue was disquiet arising from his lifestyle, particularly his close and affectionate relationships with boys under his care.\nBrowning returned to King's, where he continued his individualistic approach to teaching, and rapidly established himself as a leading Cambridge personality.  Again, his methods were far more popular with his students than with his colleagues. An avid social climber and self-promotionist, he cultivated a range of acquaintances in the social and political worlds \u2013 he stood unsuccessfully three times for Parliament \u2013 and published a number of books on English, European and world history. He also wrote on educational theory and produced a well-regarded biography of the writer George Eliot. Despite this output, he failed to gain scholastic recognition and was repeatedly overlooked for higher college posts and academic honours. However, his pioneering work in teacher education, particularly through his leadership of the CUDTC, was later recognised as a formative factor in the development of the university's present-day Department of Education.\nAfter his retirement in 1909 Browning moved to Rome and remained active as a writer until his death in 1923. Among his late works were two volumes of autobiography and further historical works, including a history of Italy. At the end of his life, having earlier been denied a knighthood, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to education.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale", "response": ["At the start of the new term in October, Albert Victor, Dalton, and Lieutenant Henderson  from Bacchante moved to Nevile's Court at Trinity College, which was generally reserved for accommodating dons rather than students.

As Jean-Victor Hocquard points out, the pseudo-Latin lyrics lectu mihi mars, as Peyerl would have sung them, resemble Bavarian German leck du mi im Arsch,Hocquard (1999, 203) which in a literal English rendering is \"[you] lick me in the arse\". More idiomatically, the phrase could be translated \"kiss my arse\" (American English \"kiss my ass\").For discussion of the German idiom, see Leck mich im Arsch.Hocquard's explanation presumes a dialectal pronoun mi \"me\". Copeman and Scheer (1996, 262) note that the Latin pronoun mihi was sometimes pronounced by German singers as , which would have been a good match for Standard German  mich. The second pun in the canon is based on the single Latin word jonicu. Emanuel Winternitz explains that when this word is sung repeatedly and rapidly, as in the canon, its syllables are liable to be heard as the Italian word cujoni, or in modern writing coglioni, meaning \"balls, testicles\".Winternitz (1958)The Standard Italian version of this word is \"coglioni\", the variant \"cujoni\" was maybe used around Mozart's time or is a dialect variant; thus it appears in a jokingly-worded letter from Beethoven to one of his publishers; his translator Emily Anderson explains it thus: \"Beethoven is trying to say ... \"coglioni\". The word was also uttered by Napoleon Bonaparte while rallying his troops. Sources: Emily Anderson (1985) The Letters of Beethoven, Vol. 2. Macmillan, p. 845; Oscar Browning (1907) The Fall of Napoleon. J. Lane, p. 25.
