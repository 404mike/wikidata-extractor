He continued working for him until 1965. He brought him Merseybeaters Freddie Starr and the Midnighters.\nIn the late 1960s, he worked for Harold Shampan at Film Music (part of Top Rank) and as freelance producer (inspired by Meek) for The Pretty Things, The Zephyrs, The V.I.P.'s, The Nocturnes etc. He produced Jethro Tull's debut single \"Sunshine Day\" (1968).   Ritchie Blackmore, whom he had known from previous work, invited him to work with Blackmore's new band, and as a result Lawrence produced Deep Purple's first three albums, the first at Pye Studios in London and the next two at De Lane Lea Studios, Kingsway, London. He produced Flash's first two albums, Flash (1972) and In The Can (1973), both at De Lane Lea. After struggling with Flash's ex-Yes guitarist, Peter Banks, he recommended that the band replace Banks, and suggested several top names.  It was advice that they failed to heed, which led to the band's abrupt break up while on tour after the release of their third self-produced album, Out Of Our Hands (1973). He produced Wishbone Ash's first three albums Wishbone Ash (1970), Pilgrimage (1971) and Argus (1972), and returned to produce their ninth album No Smoke Without Fire (1978).In 1974, Lawrence partnered with noted session musician Big Jim Sullivan to form the record label Retreat Records, also the home for Sullivan's Big Jim's Back (1975). Lawrence co-produced Sullivan's new band Tiger, featuring future Samson vocalist Nicky Moore, who released three albums before splitting up.  Stateside, Lawrence and Sullivan co-produced the first two albums by the Kiss championed Casablanca Records signing Angel, Angel (1975) and Helluva Band (1976), respectively. Lawrence also helmed Legs Diamond's self-titled 1976 debut.  At the turn of the decade, he oversaw the MCA debuts by a pair of NWOBHM contenders, Fist's Turn the Hell On and Stand Up and Fight by Quartz, both issued in 1980. Returning to his home country in 1979, Lawrence reduced his involvement, but worked with both Carl Wayne and Hot Chocolate's Tony Wilson in the 1980s. Along with Sullivan in 1992 he produced Survival, the debut album by British band Little Brother for Line Records.\nLawrence died from cancer on 13 May 2020, at the age of 78.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jethro Tull (band)", "response": ["At first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, names which included \"Navy Blue\", \"Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails\", and \"Candy Coloured Rain\". Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and concluding that the band name he didn't recognise was his. Band names were often supplied by their booking agents' staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, eventually christened them \"Jethro Tull\" after the 18th-century agriculturist. The name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return. They recorded a session with producer Derek Lawrence, which resulted in the single \"Sunshine Day\". The B-side \"Aeroplane\" was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones mixed out. It was released in February 1968 on MGM Records, miscredited to \"Jethro Toe\". Anderson has since queried the misnomer as a possible attempt by the producer to avoid paying royalties to the band. The more common version, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a counterfeit made in New York. Anderson later met Hammond while in London and the two renewed their friendship, while Anderson moved into a bedsit in Chelsea with Evan. Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, \"A Song for Jeffrey\"."]}, {"page": "UFO (band)", "response": ["After brief trial runs with Larry Wallis (February \u2013 October 1972) and Bernie Marsden (who toured with UFO in Europe and recorded a pair of demos, \"Oh My\" and \"Sixteen\") the band recruited Michael Schenker from the Scorpions in June 1973. Schenker was only 18 at the time but was already a well-respected guitarist. On a new label, Chrysalis Records, the revamped UFO recorded a non-LP single in 1973, \"Give Her the Gun\" and \"Sweet Little Thing\" with producer Derek Lawrence. In 1974, under producer Leo Lyons (formerly of Ten Years After), UFO recorded Phenomenon, which highlighted the band's harder-edged guitar sound. Phenomenon contains many fan favourites such as \"Doctor Doctor\" (later a minor hit single as a live track) and \"Rock Bottom\" (which was extended live to provide a showcase for Schenker). By the time of the Phenomenon tour, ex-Skid Row guitarist Paul \"Tonka\" Chapman joined the group, but he left in January 1975 to form Lone Star."]}, {"page": "Wishbone Ash", "response": ["In early 1970, the band secured an opening spot for Deep Purple.  Its guitarist, Ritchie Blackmore, later recommended Wishbone Ash to producer Derek Lawrence, as well as helping them secure a record deal with Decca/MCA Records. The band's debut album, Wishbone Ash, was released in December 1970. One year later, the group released Pilgrimage. The band peaked commercially in 1972 with Argus, their highest placed entry in the UK Albums Chart (#3). The album was voted by the readers of Sounds as the \"best rock album of the year\", also \"Top British Album\" (Melody Maker). The band were getting international acclaim for their live performances as they gained popularity around the world.", "The band had now begun to play major arenas as headliners. Wishbone Four (1973) was the band's first record without producer Derek Lawrence, as the band decided to produce the album themselves. In December 1973, the band released a double live album, Live Dates. There was an album released called Wishbone Ash Live in Memphis, which was a promo to FM radio stations but never sold in stores. Not long after, guitarist Ted Turner left the band. After replacing Turner with guitarist Laurie Wisefield (ex-Home), the band relocated to the US and recorded There's the Rub (1974). Locked In (1976), produced by Tom Dowd, saw the band moving towards US soft-rock territory and the group began touring with a keyboard player.", "1976's New England returned to the traditional Wishbone Ash style. Front Page News (1977) was the band's last album of this period that was recorded in the US. In 1978, after years of experimental albums, the band decided to return to its roots with No Smoke Without Fire, the first to be produced by Derek Lawrence since Argus in 1972. The album contained mainly songs written by Laurie Wisefield and Martin Turner. The band spent six months making the next album, Just Testing which was released in February 1980. Pressured by MCA to make more commercial music, Andy Powell, Laurie Wisefield and Steve Upton expressed to bassist/vocalist Martin Turner that they planned to recruit a lead singer / frontman, thus restricting Martin Turner's duties to bass guitar only. Turner felt unable to support such plans and described the position he was being put in as \"untenable\". Following a band meeting at his house, Martin Turner parted company with the band. Ironically, the band never recruited the proposed frontman and Turner, in his 2012 autobiography, described the situation as \"constructive dismissal\". However this was not a view held by the rest of the remaining band members or the then management."]}, {"page": "Jon Lord", "response": ["Lord also did session work in the late 1960s with the band \"Boz\", along with Blackmore (guitar) and Paice (drums), given that Boz was being produced by Derek Lawrence who produced Deep Purple's first three albums.

The heavier and more experimental song \"The Bird Has Flown\" was arranged and recorded later on the same day and was chosen as the B-side for the US release. The instrumental \"Wring That Neck\" from their previous album was the B-side of the British edition of \"Emmaretta\", which was issued in February 1969 and promoted by Deep Purple in their first full UK tour. This was the first time that a Deep Purple release appeared in the UK before the US. The tour started in Birmingham on 6 February with a concert broadcast by BBC Radio 1, and went on as a series of one-nighters in clubs and colleges across the country during February and March. Deep Purple's greater visibility and their declared interest in the British public induced local music magazines to print a few articles on them.
