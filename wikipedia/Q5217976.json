He was released late in October due to budget constraints, subsequently moving on to Braintree Town in November, before a short spell at East Thurrock United, and then onto Margate in summer 2005. On leaving East Thurrock, joint manager, Lee Patterson commented saying; \"With Tony [Boot] coming it means that Ellis Remy has joined Margate. Ellis is a really nice lad, but wasn't really suited to play up front with Steve West.\" After leaving Margate, Remy went on to play for Bromley, signing a short-term deal in January 2006, whilst training with Conference National club Dagenham & Redbridge. He went on to join Staines Town in March."]}, {"page": "Lunan, Daniel", "response": ["#redirectDaniel Lunan"]}]}}
