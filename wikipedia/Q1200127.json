Four of the solutions (excluding l'H\u00f4pital's) were published in the same edition of the journal as Johann Bernoulli's. In his paper, Jakob Bernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that below before showing that its solution is a cycloid. According to Newtonian scholar Tom Whiteside, in an attempt to outdo his brother, Jakob Bernoulli created a harder version of the brachistochrone problem.  In solving it, he developed new methods that were refined by Leonhard Euler into what the latter called (in 1766) the calculus of variations.  Joseph-Louis Lagrange did further work that resulted in modern infinitesimal calculus."]}, {"page": "History of logarithms", "response": ["Historian Tom Whiteside described the transition to the analytic function as follows:Derek Thomas Whiteside (1961) \"Patterns of mathematical thought in the later seventeenth century\", Archive for History of Exact Sciences 1(3):179\u2013388, \u00a7 III.1 The logarithm as a type-function pp 214\u2013231, quote p 231"]}, {"page": "Blackpool Aspire Academy", "response": ["* Prof Tom Whiteside, Historian of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Whiteside, D.

Fletcher calls it \"essential reading\" for understanding the background and content of the Greek mathematical problem-solving tradition.
