Eventually, Victor Hugo's Hernani was chosen, with Francesco Maria Piave as librettist. Ernani was successfully premiered in 1844 and within six months had been performed at twenty other theatres in Italy, and also in Vienna. The writer Andrew Porter notes that for the next ten years, Verdi's life \"reads like a travel diary\u2014a timetable of visits...to bring new operas to the stage or to supervise local premieres\". La Scala premiered none of these new works, except for Giovanna d'Arco. Verdi \"never forgave the Milanese for their reception of Un giorno di regno\"."]}, {"page": "Falstaff (opera)", "response": ["Another recurrent question is how much, if at all, Verdi was influenced by Wagner's comic opera Die Meistersinger. At the time of the premiere this was a sensitive subject; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner's music, and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi's reputation. Nevertheless, Verdi's new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s, and it seemed to some to have Wagnerian echoes.Hepokoski, pp. 138\u2013139 In 1999 the critic Andrew Porter wrote, \"That Falstaff was Verdi's and Boito's answer to Wagner's Meistersinger seems evident now.

Shortly thereafter, the British music critic Andrew Porter found most of these other cut passages could be reconstructed from the individual parts, in which the pages with the \"lost\" music had been either \"pasted, pinned or stitched down.\" In all, 21 minutes of missing music was restored.Porter, Andrew. \"Musical Events: Proper Bostonian\" The New Yorker, 2 June 1973, pp. 102\u2013108.

Oteri asks whether Montezuma and the operas of Dallapiccola ought to be regarded as being among the \"important 12-tone operas\", along with Berg's Lulu, Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, and Zimmermann's Die Soldaten.Oteri 2008. Andrea Olmstead agrees that Montezuma may aptly be compared with Berg's Lulu and Wozzeck, but primarily because of their shared extensive use of ostinato rhythms.Olmstead 1985, 17\u201318. Michael Steinberg says that it is \"arguably the richest opera yet written by an American composer\", and like Olmstead compares it to Wozzeck and Lulu (as well as to Les Troyens, Moses und Aron, War and Peace, and Palestrina) because, like them, Montezuma has long remained a \"legend\".Steinberg 1976, 11. Andrew Porter echos the \"legendary\" characterization and the comparison to Pfitzner's Palestrina, adding that these two operas, as well as Busoni's Doktor Faust, Hindemith's Harmonie der Welt, and Dallapiccola's Ulisse are \"both personal and closely argued\". At the same time, he cautions that \"both text and music are insistent, unrelaxed, and reject passive acceptance\", placing unusually high demands on the audience through the combination of Borgese's \"Wardour Street diction\" and Sessions's musical setting, which frequently superimposes two different vocal settings or accompanies the voices with orchestration that \"amounts in performance to stiff competition\".Porter 1976, 115, 118. Patrick Smith agrees with the comparison to Moses und Aron because both are works \"of the mind rather than of the opera stage\". However, he does not find Sessions the match of Schoenberg's \"ramrod genius\", so that Montezuma \"remains a tableau-oratorio\" in which the salient moments (including a love duet inspired by Verdi's Otello) fail to be \"drawn into a cohesive and ongoing whole.\" He finds the opera's greatest defect is its libretto, a \"farrago of poetasty\", which is \"a ghastly example of self-parody that even a Robert Benchley could not have topped\".Smith 1976.
