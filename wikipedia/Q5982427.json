He played in nine straight games and scored his first goal during a 2\u20130 victory in the Manchester derby at Maine Road. He spent the following season primarily with the reserve team to develop his skills. Chisnall was given the number 8 shirt at the start of the 1963\u201364 season, displacing Albert Quixall. He went on to form a strike partnership with Ian Moir and David Sadler, both of whom had also been recently promoted. His performance resulted in his being called up to the England under-23 team in November 1963. He made one appearance for the England squad, a 4\u20132 win over Germany at Anfield. Alf Ramsey said at the time that Chisnall was \"probably the best passer of a ball in the country\". However, he fell out of favour from the club starting lineup towards the latter part of 1963\u201364.  He played a total of 47 times for the club, scoring 10 goals."]}, {"page": "Moir (surname)", "response": ["* Ian Moir, Australian rugby league player", "* Ian Moir (footballer), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "History of Blackpool F.C.

Leslie Lea was sold to Cardiff City, Ian Moir to Chester City, Gerry Ingram to Preston North End, Graham Oates to Grimsby Town, and Alan Skirton to Bristol City. In addition to leaving room for new blood, the sales helped the rather shaky financial situation, something which had now become commonplace at Bloomfield Road.Calley, Roy (1992).
