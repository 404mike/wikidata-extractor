He succeeded Corrymeela's founder Ray Davey as the leader of the community in 1980 and served as its leader until 1993, providing it with a sense of cohesion and direction in its work of ecumenical Christian leadership and help for families during the Troubles.", "In 1965, Morrow was a founding member of the Corrymeela Community, a Christian group committed to promoting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  He served as the community's leader from 1980 - 1994, taking over the role from Corrymeela founder Ray Davey.  He was involved with human rights issues, such as playing a role in the foundation of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, campaigning for the UDR Four, working as a member of the Faith and Politics Group, and helping with many other campaigns for justice on behalf of those affected by the Troubles.  He also developed important links with church figures in the Netherlands, including the controversial Roel Kaptein, who shared with Corrymeela some of the stimulating philosophy of the noted critic and Bible commentator, Ren\u00e9 Girard.", "Morrow also served as university chaplain to overseas students in Glasgow from 1967.  From 1971, he was a student chaplain in Dublin where he helped to establish the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.  In 1975, he became the Presbyterian chaplain at Queen's University, where Ray Davey had been a founding predecessor.  Morrow quickly demonstrated his own breadth of vision as chaplain, as well as his sturdy independence and leadership qualities.  He was described by his students as having inspired them to take the vision of better relationships and understanding into the wider world."]}, {"page": "Davey (surname)", "response": ["* Ray Davey (footballer), New Zealand footballer", "* Ray Davey (1915\u20132012), Northern Ireland Presbyterian minister", "* Ray Davey (footballer), New Zealand footballer"]}, {"page": "2012 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["* 16 April - Ray Davey, minister, founded the Corrymeela Community, 97"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Ray Davey, Northern Irish Presbyterian minister (born 1915)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2012", "response": ["*Ray Davey, 97, Northern Irish Presbyterian minister, founder of the Corrymeela Community."]}, {"page": "Mike Gaston", "response": ["Gaston first became involved in peace building in October 1968, when Ray Davey introduced him to the Corrymeela Community.
