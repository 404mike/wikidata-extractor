Manuscripts, correspondence, newspaper clippings and other textual records, in addition to photographs and audio visual resources, make up the more than 140 meters of material held by the Archives. Russell's personal library and furniture from his home in Penrhyndeudraeth, Wales are also housed at McMaster. Russell's letters, totalling approximately 50,000, provide insight about his personal and political dealings addressing topics such as his love life, his thoughts on teaching and pacifism, and his experiences in prison. Joseph Conrad, T.S. Eliot, Nikita Khrushchev, Lady Constance Malleson, Ho Chi Minh, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Dorothy Maud Wrinch are among Russell's numerous correspondents."]}, {"page": "February 1976", "response": ["**Dorothy Maud Wrinch, 81, American mathematician and biochemical theorist "]}]}}
