He obtained his PhD at Giessen, in Germany. From 1842 he was chemistry professor at the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and from 1846 at University College, London. He was also secretary of the Chemical Society of London.\nIn 1844, he published a chemistry textbook. In 1842, he had been awarded the Royal Agricultural Society's prize for his essay Food of Plants. In 1844, he received the first Actonian Prize (of 100 guineas) for his essay Chemistry as Exemplifies the Wisdom and Beneficence of God. This work was compared to the Bridgewater Treatises and Fownes was referred to as \"a thorough chemist, a sound philosopher, and an enlightened Christian.\"He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1845, but that same year resigned from his academic positions due to ill health. For his researches in organic chemistry, he was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1847. He spent time in Barbados from 1847, in an attempt to treat the pulmonary disease afflicting him, but, on his return to England in 1848, he caught a cold and died at his father's house in Brompton at the age of 34.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Furfural", "response": ["*  See also:    In 1840, the Scottish chemist John Stenhouse found that the same chemical could be produced by distilling a wide variety of crop materials, including corn, oats, bran, and sawdust, with aqueous sulfuric acid; he also determined furfural's empirical formula (C5H4O2). George Fownes named this oil \"furfurol\" in 1845 (from furfur (bran), and oleum (oil)).  From p. 261:  \"Under the circumstances, perhaps the name \"Furfurol\" (from furfur, bran, and oleum [oil]) might be applied provisionally, and I am informed that this is the name which was proposed by the party [viz, Thomas Newborn Robert Morson (1800\u20131874)] who several years ago prepared a considerable quantity of the oil (a portion of which came into my hands, as mentioned at the commencement of this paper), and endeavoured to discover for it economical applications.\" In 1848, the French chemist  Auguste Cahours determined that furfural was an aldehyde.  From p. 285:  \"S'il ne m'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent possible de r\u00e9aliser la formation de d\u00e9riv\u00e9s analogues \u00e0 ceux que forment d'ordinaire les ald\u00e9hydes, cela tient \u00e0 la facile alt\u00e9ration de la mol\u00e9cule du furfurol de la part d'agent un peu \u00e9nergiques.\"  (If it hasn't been possible for me until now to make derivatives [that are] analogous to those which aldehydes normally form, this due to the easy alteration of the furfurol molecule by a slightly energetic reagent.)"]}, {"page": "Chemical Society", "response": ["*George Fownes"]}, {"page": "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation", "response": ["Early in 1845 critical reviews appeared in the Athenaeum, the Literary Gazette and The Gardeners' Chronicle. The most authoritative scientific and literary weekly was the Athenaeum, and its anonymous review of 4 January was by Edwin Lankester. Churchill had already been alarmed by The Lancet's report of numerous mistakes, and had been surprised to find that, unlike the medical specialists he usually dealt with, the author of Vestiges lacked first hand knowledge of the subject or the ability to correct proofs. At the author's request he had quoted for a people's edition, but was unwilling to proceed with this cheap reprint until errors had been corrected. Churchill engaged Lankester to make corrections to terminology to the second edition published in December 1844, and both Lankaster and George Fownes made further revisions for the third edition."]}, {"page": "Actonian Prize", "response": ["The first prize of one hundred guineas was awarded to George Fownes for his Chemistry as Exemplifies the Wisdom and Beneficence of God published in 1844.
