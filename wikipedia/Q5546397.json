Headline Review, New Ed, (2002)  During the 19th century, attempts to repeat the athletic challenge were made by many pedestrians, including George Wilson who attempted to walk  in 480 hours in 1815 but was arrested after 3/4 of the distance for disturbing the peace. Emma Sharp was thought to be the first woman to complete the challenge of  in 1000 hours on 29 October 1864. Later racewalkers proved to be more successful, especially Ada Anderson, who after walking  in 1000 hours was labelled by the press 'Champion Lady Walker of the World', a feat only equalled by one other, her trainer William Gale."]}, {"page": "George Wilson, the Blackheath pedestrian", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Wilson (racewalker)"]}, {"page": "George Wilson (walker)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Wilson (racewalker)"]}, {"page": "John Laurens Bicknell", "response": ["*A Brief Vindication of the legality of the late proceedings against George Wilson, the Blackheath Pedestrian (1815), on George Wilson the racewalker"]}, {"page": "The Blackheath Pedestrian", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Wilson (racewalker)"]}, {"page": "Blackheath Pedestrian", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Wilson (racewalker)"]}]}}
