He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Pontypridd from 1931 to 1937.\nHe first stood for Parliament at the 1918 general election, when Pontypridd was won by the Coalition Liberal candidate Thomas Lewis. Lewis was forced to seek re-election in July 1922 when he was appointed as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury (a nominal post held by a government whip), and the by-election was won by a new Labour candidate, Thomas Jones.\nJones held the seat for nine years until he resigned from the House of Commons on 4 February 1931. Davies was the Labour candidate in the resulting by-election, which he won 60% of the votes. He held the seat for a further seven years, until his death in November 1937, aged 64.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
