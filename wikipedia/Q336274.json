She was best known for being captain of England from 1966 to 1978, and was unbeaten in six Test series: in total, she played for the English women's cricket team from 1960 to 1982. Heyhoe Flint was captain when her team won the inaugural 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup, which England hosted. She was also the first female cricketer to hit a six in a Test match, and one of the first ten women to become a member of the MCC.\nShe also played as goalkeeper for the England national field hockey team in 1964.\nAccording to Scyld Berry: \"She was, among other achievements, the Dr WG Grace of women's cricket \u2013 the pioneer without whom the game would not be what it is.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marylebone Cricket Club", "response": ["The club's members persistently refused to allow female membership well into the 1990s, with club ballots on the change unable to attract the two-thirds majority amongst the membership required for implementation. The move to change was spearheaded by Rachael Heyhoe Flint who applied as \"R Flint\" to slip into the male-only application system. When Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie, a longstanding supporter of women's membership, took on the presidency of MCC in 1996 he led a 2-year campaign to convince the membership to vote in favour of change. In September 1998 a 70% majority of members eventually voted to allow female membership, so ending 212 years of male exclusivity, and 10 honorary life members were immediately admitted, including Heyhoe Flint. Up until this time, the Queen, who is the club's patron, was the only woman (other than domestic staff) permitted to enter the Pavilion during play. In February 1999, five women were invited to join as playing members."]}, {"page": "Lord's", "response": ["The first women's cricket match at Lord's took place in August 1976 when England and Australia played a 60-over ODI which England won by eight wickets. The opportunity to play a women's match at Lord's resulted from a campaign by Rachael Heyhoe Flint, and was given extra impetus by England's victory in the 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup. England had to wait another 11 years to play their second match at Lord's. The ground hosted the final of the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup in 1993 with England beating New Zealand to win the World Cup. The ground was not fully opened for the game and only 5,000 spectators were able to attend."]}, {"page": "PM (BBC Radio 4)", "response": ["Notable presenters after William Hardcastle included Steve Race, Brian Widlake, Robert Williams, Chris Lowe, Joan Bakewell, Susannah Simons, Rachael Heyhoe Flint and Valerie Singleton (a former Blue Peter presenter \u2014 in pre-interview chats, junior ministers \"inevitably\" claimed that they still had their Blue Peter badge)."]}, {"page": "Jack Hayward", "response": ["He funded three international racing yachts, Great Britain I, II and III, spent \u00a3100,000 on saving the sloop Gannet (the Royal Navy's only survivor of the transition from sail to steam) and contributed another \u00a3100,000 to help raise the Mary Rose.
