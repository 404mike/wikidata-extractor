He was one of the original Maastricht Rebels and was reportedly sacked for organising Euro-rebels among ministers. In 2003 Leigh opposed military intervention in Iraq; he has since called for those who voted for the Iraq War, and are still seeking to justify their support for it, to be held to account.He served as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee from 2001 to 2010, investigating government waste and seeking value for money in public expenditure. Leigh stepped down at the end of the parliamentary session in 2010, it being customary for an opposition MP to hold this post.Leigh has edited and authored three books: Right Thinking (1988); The Nation That Forgot God (2008); and Monastery of the Mind (2012).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 20", "response": ["*1950 \u2013 Edward Leigh, English lawyer and politician"]}, {"page": "Conservative Party (UK)", "response": ["Most oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24\u2011week abortion limit.
