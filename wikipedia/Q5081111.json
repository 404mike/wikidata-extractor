For this film, Wontner jettisoned the toup\u00e9e and Ian Fleming returned to the role of Dr. Watson. Lyn Harding took over the role of Professor Moriarty from Norman McKinnel, and Charles Mortimer took over the role of Inspector Lestrade from Philip Hewland. Wonter's age, fifty-nine by this time, was too difficult to hide so Holmes is on the verge of retiring. The film is a very accurate adaptation of The Valley of Fear. The film received rave reviews which would lead to one final film."]}, {"page": "Birds of a Feather (1936 film)", "response": ["* Charles Mortimer as Sir Michael"]}, {"page": "Aren't Men Beasts!", "response": ["* Charles Mortimer as Detective"]}, {"page": "You Made Me Love You (film)", "response": ["*Charles Mortimer as Mr Daly"]}, {"page": "Watch Beverly", "response": ["* Charles Mortimer - Sir James Briden"]}, {"page": "Old Roses", "response": ["* Charles Mortimer as John Morgan "]}, {"page": "Dial 999 (1955 film)", "response": ["* Charles Mortimer as Harding "]}, {"page": "Things Are Looking Up (film)", "response": ["* Charles Mortimer as Harry "]}, {"page": "Living Dangerously (film)", "response": ["* Charles Mortimer as Inspector Webster  "]}, {"page": "Boomerang (1934 film)", "response": ["* Charles Mortimer "]}, {"page": "List of actors who have played Inspector Lestrade", "response": ["| Charles Mortimer"]}, {"page": "Mortimer, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Mortimer"]}]}}
