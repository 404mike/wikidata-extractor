He enlisted in the Manchester Regiment at the age of 14 and was promoted to lance corporal within a week.  When his father realised what Battersby had done, he intervened and had him commissioned as an officer in the East Lancashire Regiment.  Battersby was wounded in action leading a platoon over the top on the first day of the Somme but returned to duty to fight in the 1917 Operations on the Ancre.  It was here that he was struck by shrapnel from a German shell, resulting in the amputation of his left leg.  Battersby was asked to resign his commission owing to disability but insisted he could still be of use to the army if fitted with a prosthetic leg and successfully returned to duty with a Royal Engineers transport unit.  After the war he studied theology and became a vicar at Chittoe, Wiltshire.  During the Second World War he organised the local Home Guard unit and between 1943 and 1945 served as a chaplain to the Royal Marines at Chatham Dockyard.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bromham, Wiltshire", "response": ["Reginald St John Battersby was vicar of Chittoe from 1934 until his retirement in 1972.

This included Horace Iles who was shamed into joining up after being handed a white feather by a woman at the age of fourteen.  He died at the Battle of the Somme at the age of sixteen.  Also signing up as a private at age fourteen was Reginald St John Battersby.  He was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant at the insistence of his father and headmaster who thought that his rank was inappropriate for a middle-class boy.  Battersby was wounded by machine gun fire while leading his men over the top at the Somme.  Three months later he lost a leg to shellfire.Teenage Tommies, BBC Two, first broadcast 11 November 2014."]}, {"page": "Reginald Battersby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald St John Battersby"]}, {"page": "St John Battersby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald St John Battersby"]}, {"page": "Reginald St John Beardsworth Battersby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald St John Battersby "]}, {"page": "Reginald Beardsworth Battersby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald St John Battersby "]}, {"page": "Reginald St. John Battersby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald St John Battersby"]}]}}
