After one season, he joined Dulwich Hamlet, where he was dual-registered to Beckenham Town, before switching to Champion Hill cohabitants Fisher Athletic in 2007. After a loan spell at Sittingbourne and one-and-a-half years with Fisher, Lewington joined Leatherhead, where his performances earned him a move to the Football League with Dagenham & Redbridge.\nIn his early days with Dagenham, Lewington was primarily back-up to Daggers legend Tony Roberts until his retirement in 2011. From 2011 to 2014, Lewington was first-choice goalkeeper at the club, where he racked up 143 appearances in all competitions. With his contract expiring in the summer of 2014, he opted to leave in order to find a new challenge. He then joined Colchester United to challenge Sam Walker for the number one jersey, but made just two appearances before being released one year later. He joined Margate in December 2015.\nAlongside his playing commitments, Lewington studied for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physical education and sport, and also has an FA coaching qualification. He runs his own specialised goalkeeping coaching sessions, alongside working as a part-time lecturer at North West Kent College in Dartford as a goalkeeping coach and sports lecturer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lewington", "response": ["* Chris Lewington (born 1988), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2010 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["|GK ||30 ||Chris Lewington"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Chris Lewington"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Chris Lewington"]}, {"page": "James Shea", "response": ["Shea was sent out on loan to League Two club Dagenham & Redbridge for the 2011\u201312 season.
