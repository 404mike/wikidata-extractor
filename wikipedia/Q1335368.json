He played traditional jazz with Alan Elsdon, The Mike Daniels' Delta Jazzmen and also The Zenith Six.  He continued and extended his career musically from 1967 with the Scottish dixieland jazz trumpet and cornet player Alex Welsh and his Jazz Band.  He began playing alto, baritone, soprano saxophone and the flute.  His association with Welsh lasted for 10 years until 1977.  During this period he rose to fame in the jazz arena appearing at the Newport Jazz Festival aged 37 in 1969.  His skills on baritone saxophone earned him a huge jazz fan base, some suggesting he was the best they had seen in Europe.
