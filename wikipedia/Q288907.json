She allegedly administered large doses of insulin to at least two of her victims, and a large air bubble was found in the body of another, but police were unable to establish how all the attacks were carried out.In May 1993, at Nottingham Crown Court, she received thirteen life sentences for the crimes. Mr Justice Latham, sentencing, told Allitt that she was \"a serious danger\" to others and was unlikely ever to be considered safe enough to be released.

He practised mainly in criminal law on the Midland and Oxford Circuit, with a side line in personal injury.  He was most well known for his ability to connect with a jury and see to the crux of a matter.  He served as defence counsel in the Matrix Churchill case in 1992, and in the murder trial of Beverley Allitt in 1993 after which families of the victims praised his sensitive conduct of a powerful defence. He was prosecution counsel in the trial of groom Clem O'Brien for the murder of racehorse trainer Alex Scott in 1995.
