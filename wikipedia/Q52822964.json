Fluent in half-a-dozen languages, he taught modern languages at Stow College and Winchester College while simultaneously establishing himself as a music critic, first at the London Mercury (1935-9), then (interrupted by the war) the Daily Herald (1946-50) and The Spectator (1947-54). In 1950 he joined the Daily Telegraph as assistant to Richard Capell, succeeding him as chief music critic four years later when Capell died. He remained at the Telegraph until his retirement in 1976 and was succeeded by Peter Stadlen. He was also editor of the Musical Times between 1953 and 1956.Cooper is best known for his book French Music, first published in 1951. He was a lifelong enthusiast of Gluck and a champion of the often vilified Meyerbeer, Gounod and Massenet. He was less forgiving  of what he saw as the romantic excesses of Mahler, Strauss and Elgar. But his interests were wide-ranging, encompassing German and Russian music, as well as a broader, cosmopolitan perspective on philosophy, literature and cultural and political history than most of his English contemporaries.He married the artist Mary Stewart in 1940. There were four children, including the novelist Dominic Cooper and the pianist Imogen Cooper. Cooper was appointed CBE in 1972. In retirement he turned increasingly to translation, including the collected essays of Pierre Boulez and a new translation of Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades. He died in Richmond-upon-Thames.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky", "response": ["By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building \"into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity\", as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place.Brown, New Grove vol. 18, p. 628.

In 1951 Martin Cooper of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Massenet's detractors, including some fellow composers, were on the whole idealistic, even puritanical, \"but few of them have in practice achieved anything so near perfection in any genre, however humble, as Massenet achieved in his best works.\"Cooper, French Music (1951), quoted in Hughes and van Thal, p. 250 In 1955 Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor commented in The Record Guide that, although usually dismissed as an inferior Gounod, Massenet wrote music with a distinct flavour of its own. \"He had a gift for melody of a suave, voluptuous and eminently singable kind, and the intelligence and dramatic sense to make the most of it.\" The writers called for revivals of Gris\u00e9lidis, Le jongleur de Notre-Dame, Don Quichotte and Cendrillon, all then neglected.Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 433 By the 1990s, Massenet's reputation had been considerably rehabilitated. In The Penguin Opera Guide (1993), Hugh Macdonald wrote that though Massenet's operas never equalled the grandeur of Berlioz's Les Troyens, the genius of Bizet's Carmen or the profundity of Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, from the 1860s until the years before the First World War, the composer gave the French lyric stage a remarkable series of works, two of which \u2013 Manon and Werther \u2013 are \"masterpieces that will always grace the repertoire\". In Macdonald's view, Massenet \"embodies many enduring aspects of the belle \u00e9poque, one of the richest cultural periods in history\".Macdonald, pp. 216\u2013217 In France, Massenet's 20th-century eclipse was less complete than elsewhere, but his oeuvre has been revalued in recent years. In 2003 Piotr Kaminsky wrote in Mille et un op\u00e9ras of Massenet's skill in translating French text into flexible melodic phrases, his exceptional orchestral virtuosity, combining sparkle and clarity, and his unerring theatrical instinct.Kaminsky, p. 864 Begun by Jean-Louis Pichon in November 1990, the Massenet Festival in Massenet's native Saint-\u00c9tienne have produced biennial performances to promote and celebrate his music."]}, {"page": "List of German Jews", "response": ["* Giacomo Meyerbeer, composerGiacomo Meyerbeer, 1791\u20131864 by Martin Cooper"]}, {"page": "Egon Wellesz", "response": ["Despite his composing, Wellesz remains best known as an academic and teacher, and for his extensive scholarly contributions to the study of Byzantine music and opera in the 17th century.

Oxford History of Western Music 4 (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p.\u00a05. .

However, over the long run, opinion has remained generally mixed, leaning toward negative. Among musicologists, Martin Cooper considers it \"the weakest, most academic\" of the seven the composer completed.Cooper, 30. Warrack notes a disjunction between the work's various musical elements. He writes that it \"lacks the individuality of its fellows\" and notes \"a somewhat awkward tension between the regularity of a symphonic form he was consciously trying to achieve in a 'Germanic' way and his own characteristics.\" Wiley, less polarizing, calls the Third the \"least comformative\" of the symphonies and admits its unorthodox structure and wide range of material \"may produce an impression of strangeness, especially of genre.\"Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 132.

This was considered a provocative move by the music establishment, and there was a lengthy correspondence in The Times between Thomas Armstrong, Principal of the Royal Academy of Music in London, and Martin Cooper, arguing the pros and cons of taking a gifted child out of conventional education to specialise so early, and in a foreign country."]}, {"page": "Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)", "response": ["The work is in three movements. The Moderato first movement follows a typical sonata form with an expressive and cantabile opening theme. The Allegro second movement begins with a terse but humorous scherzo, which Martin Cooper believes is based on two folk songs, followed by a trio section. The last movement comprises multiple contrasting sections: a slow introductory recitative, an arioso dolente, a fugue, a return of the arioso, and a second fugue that builds to a passionate and heroic conclusion. William Kinderman finds parallels between the last movement's fugue and other late works by Beethoven, such as the fughetta in the Diabelli Variations and sections of the Missa solemnis, and Adolf Bernhard Marx favourably compares the fugue to those of Bach and Handel. The sonata is the subject of musical analyses including studies by Donald Tovey, Denis Matthews, Heinrich Schenker, and Charles Rosen. It has been recorded by pianists such as Artur Schnabel, Glenn Gould, and Alfred Brendel.", "Beethoven uses antiphonal dynamics (four bars of piano contrasted against four bars of forte), and opens the movement with a six-note falling-scale motif. Martin Cooper finds that Beethoven indulged the rougher side of his humour in the scherzo by using motifs from two folk songs, \"Unsa k\u00e4tz h\u00e4d kaz'ln g'habt\" (\"Our cat has had kittens\") and \"Ich bin l\u00fcderlich, du bist l\u00fcderlich\" (\"I am a draggle-tail, you are a draggle-tail\"). Tovey earlier decided that such theories of the themes' origins were \"unscrupulous\", since the first of these folk songs was arranged by Beethoven some time before this work's composition in payment for a publisher's trifling postage charge \u2013 the nature of the arrangement making it clear that the folk songs were of little importance to the composer.", "The third movement's structure alternates two slow arioso sections with two faster fugues. In Brendel's analysis, there are six sections \u2013 recitative, arioso, first fugue, arioso, fugue inversion, homophonic conclusion. In contrast, Martin Cooper describes the structure as a \"double movement\" (an Adagio and a finale).", "Matthews writes that it is not fanciful to see the final movement's second fugue as a \"gathering of confidence after illness or despair\", a theme which can be discerned in other late works by Beethoven (Brendel compares it with the Cavatina from the String Quartet No. 13). Martin Cooper describes the coda as \"passionate\" and \"heroic\", but not out of place after the ariosos' distress or the fugues' \"luminous verities\". Rosen states that this movement is the first time in the history of music where the academic devices of counterpoint and fugue are integral to a composition's drama, and observes that Beethoven in this work does not \"simply symbolize or represent the return to life, but persuades us physically of the process\".", "When writing about the sonata in 1909, Hermann Wetzel observed, \"Not a single note is superfluous, and there is no passage ... that can be treated as you please, no trivial ornament\".
