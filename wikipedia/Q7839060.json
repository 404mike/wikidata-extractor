He went on to play for Northwich Victoria, Hednesford Town, Wellingborough Town, Kidsgrove Athletic, Tamworth, Harrogate Town and Woking. In 2010, he briefly joined Australian semi-pro side Sunshine George Cross, but failed to make an appearance and returned to the English Non-league game where he went on to feature for Bedlington Terriers, Wroxham and Morpeth Town.
