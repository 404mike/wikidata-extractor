Bass player Kelly Groucutt and classically-trained cellist Melvyn Gale both joined the band as their replacements. Following the conclusion of the Eldorado's European leg of the tour, the band began recording the new album at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. ELO had frequently opened for Deep Purple for the initial North American leg of the Eldorado Tour, and Deep Purple had recommended Musicland to ELO. This was the first time ELO recorded at Musicland and the band would later return to record most of the future albums here due to frontman Jeff Lynne's great fondness for it and his working relationship with sound engineer Mack.", "Lynne, also the band's sole songwriter, wanted to move towards more tunes that would be memorable rather than the usual progressive-rock style of the group's first three albums and straight symphonic sound of the Eldorado. New measures were taken to ensure a more-complex but satisfying sound, such as backing female vocalists of Ellie Greenwich, Susan Collins, Nancy O'Neill and Marge Raymond, a choir, and the band's string trio of Mik Kaminski, Hugh McDowell and Melvyn Gale mixed into the backing 30-piece string section and also allowing them to perform some of the solos on the records. While Lynne was the lead vocalist for a vast majority of the band's songs, Kelly Groucutt sang lead vocals on \"Poker\" and (alternating with Lynne) on \"Nightrider\", giving the tracks a dynamic sound. The backing orchestra was recorded separately from the band's initial sessions, being recorded instead at De Lane Lea Studios in London, England.", "* Melvyn Gale \u2013 cello"]}, {"page": "A New World Record", "response": ["* Melvyn Gale\u00a0\u2013 cello"]}, {"page": "Out of the Blue (Electric Light Orchestra album)", "response": ["*Melvyn Gale \u2013 cello, jangle piano on \"Wild West Hero\" (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "Discovery (Electric Light Orchestra album)", "response": ["Discovery is notable in that it was the first ELO album not to feature their resident string trio of Mik Kaminski, Hugh McDowell and Melvyn Gale, although they did make an appearance on the Discovery music videos.", "*Melvyn Gale \u2013 cello"]}, {"page": "Gale (surname)", "response": ["* Melvyn Gale (born 1952), cellist for the Electric Light Orchestra"]}, {"page": "ELO's Greatest Hits", "response": ["*Melvyn Gale \u2013 cello (1975 onwards)"]}, {"page": "Afterglow (Electric Light Orchestra album)", "response": ["* Melvyn Gale\u00a0\u2013 cello (1975 onwards)"]}, {"page": "Flashback (Electric Light Orchestra album)", "response": ["*Melvyn Gale \u2013 cello (1975\u20131977)"]}, {"page": "1952 in British music", "response": ["*15 January \u2013 Melvyn Gale, cellist (Electric Light Orchestra)"]}, {"page": "Haberdashers' Hatcham College", "response": ["* Melvyn Gale, Musician, Electric Light Orchestra"]}, {"page": "All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra", "response": ["*Melvyn Gale \u2013 Cello"]}, {"page": "Strange Magic: The Best of Electric Light Orchestra", "response": ["*Melvyn Gale - Cello (1974 onwards)"]}, {"page": "Hugh McDowell", "response": ["In 1980, McDowell played on the album Gift Wrapped by former ELO cellist Melvyn Gale, who had founded the group Wilson Gale & Co.
