He began work as a clerk at the Bank of British North America in London, and was transferred to the Montreal branch in 1874 and the Ottawa branch in 1875. In 1876, he began work as an assistant in the Library of Parliament and discovered an interest in botany and entomology. He was one of the founding members of the Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club and a president of the Ottawa Horticultural Society. He was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1885.\nFletcher established a national reporting system to help identify and control the spread of insects and weeds harmful to agriculture. In 1887, he became the first Dominion Entomologist and Botanist attached to the Central Experimental Farm. He helped set up measures to control the spread of plant diseases and harmful insects from both within and outside Canada. He was a founder of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, now the Entomological Society of America, and a fellow of the Linnean Society of London. Fletcher also initiated the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids, and Nematodes (CNC).\nBesides his contributions to scientific journals and bulletins published by the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, he published with George H. Clark, The Farm Weeds of Canada in 1906.\nHe died in Montreal in 1908.\nThe Fletcher Wildlife Garden at the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, was named after him. On February 15, 2016, Fletcher was designated a National Historic Person. A federal historical marker reflecting that status was unveiled on November 9, 2017, at the Experimental Farm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*James Fletcher (1852\u20131908) \u2013 Canadian entomologist, botanist and writer"]}, {"page": "James Fletcher", "response": ["James Fletcher may refer to:", "*James Fletcher (English politician), MP for Cambridge", "* James Fletcher (Australian politician) (1834\u20131891), Australian coalminer and owner, newspaper proprietor and politician", "* James Fletcher (entomologist) (1852\u20131908), Canadian entomologist, botanist and writer", "* James Fletcher (industrialist) (1886\u20131974), New Zealand businessman and industrialist", "* James Fletcher Jnr (1914\u20132007), his son, New Zealand businessman and industrialist", "* James Fletcher (footballer) (1926\u20132014), English footballer active in the 1950s", "* James Fletcher Epes, U.S. representative from Virginia"]}, {"page": "Eupithecia fletcherata", "response": ["The species was named in honour of Dr. James Fletcher."]}, {"page": "Persons of National Historic Significance", "response": ["|James Fletcher"]}, {"page": "Canadian Field-Naturalist", "response": ["* James Fletcher (18521908), founding member"]}, {"page": "Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club", "response": ["* James Fletcher (18521908), founding member"]}, {"page": "Williamsonia fletcheri", "response": ["The Ebony Boghaunter was first scientifically described in 1923 by American entomologist Edward Bruce Williamson based on 10 specimens collected in Mer Bleue Bog in Ottawa.

He travelled to Canada in September of the same year to take up his position, and immediately began an overhaul of the entomology service in the Department of Agriculture. By 1915, Hewitt had expanded the entomology service from a small division of the experimental-farms branch into its own branch of the Department with four divisions, each headed by an entomologist. These divisions included systemic entomology, field-crop and garden insects, forest insects, and foreign-pest suppression. Hewitt had a talent for attracting the top entomologists of the time, including Reginald Charles Treherne and Norman Criddle. In 1916, Hewitt became consulting zoologist to the dominion as well as dominion entomologist."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (E\u2013F)", "response": ["* Fletcher \u2013 James Fletcher (1852\u20131908)"]}]}}
