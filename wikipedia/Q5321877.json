He applied public choice theory to state education and \"he had a profound influence on both academic scholarship and education policy in Britain and abroad\". The E.G. West Centre at Newcastle University is named in his honor.\nWest grew up in Exeter and graduated with a degree in Economics from University College, Exeter in 1948. He then spent three years as a schoolteacher in Staffordshire, before becoming a lecturer at Guildford College of Technology (1951) and Oxford College of Technology (1956). In 1962 he was hired by Stan Dennison for the Economics faculty at Newcastle University.His book, Education and the State, published in 1965, continues to be highly influential. He researched how the state gradually became more and more involved in the education system of England and other countries. He examined the effect it had on the quality of education, concluding that its influence was ultimately negative.\nWest was visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley (1974), Emory University (1985-1988), the University of Western Australia (1995) and the University of Kentucky (1995).", "link_mentions": {}}}
