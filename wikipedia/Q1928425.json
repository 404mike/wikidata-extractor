This came in the 2013 German Masters, by defeating Yu Delu and Fergal O'Brien. He lost 2\u20135 to Barry Hawkins in the first round in Berlin.

The crowd warmed to Poomjaeng as he walked to the wrong table at the start of play and animatedly expressed his emotions throughout the match, including applauding his own safety shot. He played Michael White in the second round and lost the fourth frame without a ball having been potted due to missing the reds three times. The rules of snooker state that if a red can be seen full ball and is missed on three consecutive shots, the frame is conceded. Poomjaeng lost the session 1\u20137 and went on to be defeated 3\u201313.
