Largely neglected as a composer in his lifetime, he made an important contribution to the British piano repertoire and was influential in spreading knowledge of a wide range of mainly unfashionable music.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Franz Schmidt", "response": ["*Symphony No. 4 in C major.Written in 1933, this is the best-known work of his entire oeuvre. The composer called it \"A requiem for my daughter\". It begins with a long 23-bar melody on an unaccompanied solo trumpet (which returns at the symphony's close, \"transfigured\" by all that has intervened). The Adagio is an immense ABA ternary structure. The first A is an expansive threnody on solo cello (Schmidt's own instrument) whose seamless lyricism predates Strauss's Metamorphosen by more than a decade (its theme is later adjusted to form the scherzo of the symphony); the B section is an equally expansive funeral march (unmistakably referencing the Marcia Funebre from Beethoven's Eroica in its texture) whose dramatic climax is marked by an orchestral crescendo culminating in a gong and cymbal crash (again, a clear allusion to similar climaxes in the later symphonies of Bruckner, and followed by what Harold Truscott has brilliantly described as a \"reverse climax\", leading back to a repeat of the A section).", "*Harold Truscott \u2013 The Music of Franz Schmidt \u2013 1: The Orchestral Music (Toccata Press, London, 1984)"]}, {"page": "1992 in music", "response": ["* October 7 \u2013 Harold Truscott, composer, pianist, broadcaster and writer on music, 78"]}, {"page": "Franz Berwald", "response": ["One of the examples given by Harold Truscott (in his analysis of Havergal Brian's Gothic Symphony) of composers prior to Brian writing \"sonata movements which do not order their events on the usual plan\" is Franz Berwald, \"a storehouse of them ... but he never did unusual things in any way that impaired sonata style.
