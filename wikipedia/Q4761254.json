Derby performed well in the FA Cup though and Cherry kept a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw  away at Plymouth Argyle in the sixth round, denying Gordon Staniforth on multiple occasions. However he conceded directly from a corner kick in the replay and felt \"lower than the village idiot\", whilst goalscorer Andy Rogers admitted the goal was \"an absolute fluke\". Derby were relegated at the end of the campaign and Cherry rejected new manager Arthur Cox's offer of a new three-year contract starting at \u00a3275-a-week.
