They became a transitional group between early hard rock and heavy metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. The band's current lineup includes vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, and drummer Andy Parker. They have gone through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had two hiatuses (1983\u20131984 and again from 1989 to 1991). The band are also notable for featuring former Scorpions guitarist and MSG founder Michael Schenker, who was a member of UFO from 1973 to 1978 and again, occasionally, between 1993 and 2003, when Moore replaced him. In May 2018, Mogg announced that he would retire from UFO after one last tour as a member of the band in 2019; however, the band plans to resume their farewell tour in 2022.", "Lead singer Phil Mogg, guitarist Mick Bolton, bassist Pete Way and drummer Andy Parker formed the band in 1968. Having originally called themselves Hocus Pocus, the group changed their name in October 1969 to UFO, in honour of the London club where they were spotted by Noel Moore, who signed them to the Beacon Records label, headed by Antiguan-born Milton Samuel. Their first album, UFO 1, released in 1970, is a typical example of early hard rock; it includes a heavy version of the Eddie Cochran classic \"C'mon Everybody\". Neither their first nor their second album, UFO 2: Flying, was successful, but the song \"Boogie For George\" from the first album reached No. 30 on the German singles chart, and \"Prince Kajuku\" from Flying reached No. 26. At this time UFO attracted little interest in Britain and America. Some of their early work was strongly influenced by space rock (their second album, featuring a 26-minute title track and a 19-minute-long track \"Star Storm\", was subtitled One Hour Space Rock) that was modestly popular at the time, but the band soon realised the style was somewhat limited. Mick Bolton left the group in January 1972, and UFO set out to find a guitarist who could provide the band with a more standard rock sound.", "Phil Mogg and Pete Way continued working together throughout this fluctuating band membership, releasing two albums under the Mogg/Way name in the late 1990s, Edge of the World and Chocolate Box.", "In May 2018, vocalist Phil Mogg announced that UFO's 50th anniversary tour in 2019 would be his last one as the frontman of the band, who may also either split up or move on with a replacement for him. Mogg explained, \"This decision has been a long time coming. I've considered stepping down at the end of UFO's previous two tours. I don't want to call this a farewell tour as I hate that word, but next year's gigs will represent my final tap-dancing appearances with the band.\" He added that \"the timing feels right\" for him to quit, and that \"there will be a final tour of the U.K. and we will also play some shows in selected other cities that the band has a strong connection with. But outside of the U.K. this won't be a long tour.\" Despite earlier reports that Mogg had intended to leave the band in 2019, he is still a member of UFO as of June 2021, and the band will resume their touring activities in the summer and fall of 2022, which had been pushed back from a year earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic. UFO's last-ever show will take place on October 29, 2022 in Athens, Greece, where the band performed first its show with current guitarist Vinnie Moore eighteen years earlier.", "*Phil Mogg \u2013 vocals (1968\u20131983, 1984\u20131989, 1991\u2013present)", "* Interview with vocalist Phil Mogg"]}, {"page": "Force It", "response": ["* Phil Mogg \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "No Heavy Petting", "response": ["*Phil Mogg \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Obsession (UFO album)", "response": ["*Phil Mogg \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "UFO 2: Flying", "response": ["* Phil Mogg - vocals"]}, {"page": "UFO 1", "response": ["* Phil Mogg - vocals"]}, {"page": "Lights Out (UFO album)", "response": ["*Phil Mogg \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "No Place to Run (album)", "response": ["#\"Lettin' Go\" (Phil Mogg, Pete Way) - 3:51", "*Phil Mogg \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Michael Schenker", "response": ["In 1993, Schenker rejoined UFO.
