He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his Elegia Prima, a first Latin elegy, to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of John Aubrey, Chappell \"whipt\" Milton. This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell.Wedgwood 1961 p. 178. Historian Christopher Hill cautiously notes that Milton was \"apparently\" rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal.Hill 1977 p. 34. It is also possible that, like Isaac Newton four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the plague, by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625. In 1626, Milton's tutor was Nathaniel Tovey."]}, {"page": "1582", "response": ["* December 10 \u2013 William Chappell, Irish bishop (d. 1649)"]}, {"page": "1649", "response": ["** William Chappell, Irish bishop (b. 1582)"]}, {"page": "James Ussher", "response": ["In 1633, Ussher had supported the appointment of Archbishop Laud as Chancellor of the University of Dublin. He had hoped that Laud would help to impose order on what was, Ussher accepted, a somewhat mismanaged institution. Laud did that, rewriting the charter and statutes to limit the authority of the fellows, and ensure that the appointment of the provost was under royal control. In 1634, he imposed on the college an Arminian provost, William Chappell, whose theological views, and peremptory style of government, were antithetical to everything for which Ussher stood. By 1635, it was apparent that Ussher had lost de facto control of the church to John Bramhall, Bishop of Derry, in everyday matters and to Laud in matters of policy."]}, {"page": "Ramism", "response": ["There is a short treatise by John Milton, who was a student at Christ's from 1625, published two years before his death, called Artis Logicae Plenior Institutio ad Petri Rami Methodum concinnata.Milton's Logic has been translated by Walter J. Ong and Charles J. Ermatinger in Yale's Complete Prose Works of John Milton (1982, 8: 206\u2013408), with an introduction by Ong (144\u2013205). It was one of the last commentaries on Ramist logic.William Bridges Hunter, A Milton Encyclopedia (1978), article Logic and Rhetoric, p. 33. Although composed in the 1640s, it was not published until 1672. Milton, whose first tutor at Christ's William Chappell used Ramist method, can take little enough credit for the content. Most of the text proper is adapted from the 1572 edition of Ramus's logic; most of the commentary is adapted from George Downham's Commentarii in P.

Christ's under Thomas Bainbrigg, Master from 1622, was harmonious on religious questions, a great contrast to the situation some years earlier when Valentine Carey had clashed with William Ames, and the fellowship of 13 included a range of views.Campbell & Corns 2008, p. 26 and p. 392, n. 10. Milton matriculated on 9 April 1625 with William Chappell as his tutor.Campbell 2003, p. 486. He intended, according to the Subscription Book, to become a minister, and his course of study at Cambridge was based around this vocation. More of Milton's studies at Cambridge is unknown, but he did begin to study with Chappell, who was a respected scholar and became a staunch Arminian and Laudian. Milton would have attended lectures by Samuel Collins, Robert Creighton, and Robert Metcalfe, in addition to hearing Richard Sibbes and George Herbert preach.Lewalski, pp. 19\u201320. The Fellow of Christ's with the greatest reputation for his contemporaries was Joseph Mede,Campbell & Corns 2008, p. 28. but it has not been shown that he had personal influence on Milton. It has been argued that Milton later took from Mede's writings some conceptions on the millennium.Hutton 2003, pp.35\u20137.

Ormonde left Ireland 28 August 1647, and Margetson fled to England about the same time. He suffered imprisonment at Manchester and elsewhere, but was afterwards allowed to live in London unmolested, but very poor. He was employed by royalists to dispense money among distressed supporters, in England and Wales, and William Chappell may have been one who was supported in this way."]}]}}
