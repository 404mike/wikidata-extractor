She had already written a Celtic-influenced song named \"The March of the Celts\", and submitted it to the project. Each episode was to feature a different composer at first, but director David Richardson liked her track so much, he had Enya score the entire series. Enya recorded 72 minutes of music at Aigle Studio and the BBC studios in Wood Lane, London without recording to picture, though she was required to portray certain themes and ideas that the producers wanted. Unlike The Frog Prince, she worked with little interference which granted her freedom to establish her sound that she would adopt throughout her future career, signified by layered vocals, keyboard-oriented music, and percussion with elements of Celtic, classical, church and folk music.", "In September 2003, Enya returned to Aigle Studio to start work on her sixth studio album, Amarantine. Roma said the title means \"everlasting\". The album marks the first instance of Enya singing in Loxian, a fictional language created by Roma that came about when Enya was working on \"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\". After numerous attempts to sing the song in English, Irish and Latin, Roma suggested a new language based on some of the sounds Enya would sing along to when developing her songs. It was a success, and Enya sang \"Less Than a Pearl\" and \"The River Sings\" in the same way. Roma worked on the language further, creating a \"culture and history\" behind it surrounding the Loxian people who are of another planet, questioning the existence of life on another. \"Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)\" is sung in Japanese. Amarantine was a global success, reaching number 6 on the Billboard 200 and number 8 in the UK. It has sold over 1 million certified copies in the US, a considerable drop in sales in comparison to her previous albums. Enya dedicated the album to BBC producer Tony McAuley, who had commissioned Enya to write the soundtrack to The Celts, following his death in 2003. The lead single, \"Amarantine\", was released in December 2005. A Christmas Special Edition was released in 2006, followed by a Deluxe Edition."]}, {"page": "Enya (album)", "response": ["Enya is the debut studio album by Irish singer, songwriter, and musician Enya, released in March 1987 by BBC Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States.

The album is a selection of music she recorded for the soundtrack to the BBC television series The Celts, aired in 1987, though the TV connection is downplayed on the sleeve. Four years into her largely unnoticed solo career, Enya landed her first major project in 1985 when producer Tony McAuley asked her to contribute a song to the soundtrack. After its director David Richardson liked her demo, Enya accepted his offer to compose the entire score with her longtime recording partners, producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan.", "Following her work on the soundtrack to the romantic comedy film The Frog Prince (1984), Enya's first major project as a solo artist followed when, in 1985, she was invited by producer Tony McAuley to compose a track for his 1987 BBC television documentary series The Celts. As a coincidence, Enya had recorded a track named \"March of the Celts\" before she was asked to be involved, and decided to submit it to the project. Initially, each episode of the series was to feature a different composer, but series director David Richardson liked Enya's track so much, he commissioned her to compose the entire score."]}, {"page": "Culture of Northern Ireland", "response": ["* Tony McAuley"]}, {"page": "List of Queen's University Belfast people", "response": ["* Tony McAuley \u2013 broadcaster and musician"]}, {"page": "Amarantine (album)", "response": ["After the release of her box set Only Time \u2013 The Collection in November 2002, Enya took several months off from writing, recording, and releasing music.
