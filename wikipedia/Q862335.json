This could happen for long-period comets also but the chance is highest for short-period comets. The chance of these directly impacting Earth is far lower than a near-Earth object (NEO) impact. Victor Clube and Bill Napier support a controversial theory that a short-period comet in an Earth-crossing orbit does not need to impact to be hazardous, as it could disintegrate and cause a dust veil with possibilities of a \"nuclear winter\" scenario with long-term global cooling lasting for thousands of years (which they consider to be similar in probability to a 1\u00a0km impact)."]}, {"page": "Victor Clube", "response": ["He was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead and Christ Church, Oxford.Description of Clube in The Cosmic Serpent, by Victor Clube and Bill Napier.
