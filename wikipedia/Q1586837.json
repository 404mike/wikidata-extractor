The friars vow to hide the dragon until after the comet passes. Twenty years later, eight days before the fateful day, the king (Ken Shorter) names Lord Osric (Harry Van Gorkum), his chief advisor, and the task of caring for the dragon falls upon the novice monk Mansel (Matt Hickey). Meanwhile, two Hebei Province citizens, Master Kwan (Henry O) and his son (Rona Figueroa), seek the dragon to prevent the prophecy. Geoff (Chris Masterson), an orphaned stable boy in the monastery, befriends the young dragon hidden in the dungeon named Drake (Robby Benson). After the kingdom becomes aware of Drake's existence, he and Geoff fail to see the dangers hidden around them as Osric, anticipating the comet's arrival, uses Geoff's desire to be a knight to get close to Drake.", "|Harry Van Gorkum", "Harry Van Gorkum", "|Harry Van Gorkum"]}]}}
