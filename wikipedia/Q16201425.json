The first match saw the Wales rugby league team, take on their counterparts from New Zealand in the first true international rugby league game in world history. The team consisted of Welsh exiles form the Northern Union teams, plus two players from both Ebbw Vale (Chick Jenkins and Oliver Burgham) and Merthyr Tydfil (Dai \"Tarw\" Jones and David Davies). Rather than playing the game at either Ebbw Vale or Merthyr, the neutral ground of Aberdare Athletic Ground was chosen by the Northern Union.Lush (1998), pg. 28 An earlier attempt to produce a professional team in Aberdare had failed, despite the fact that the town had been at the centre of the \"shamateurism\" row; mainly due to a failure to achieve financial backing and a failure to secure a playing field. After a crowd of 15000 paid \u00a3560 to watch Wales win 9-8, and the commercial potential of a Northern Union club became more apparent. A group of 'tradesmen and sportsmen' met in March 1908 to agree financing, and from this Aberdare RLFC was formed."]}, {"page": "List of Halifax R.L.F.C. players", "response": ["* Oliver Burgham won caps for Wales while at Ebbw Vale in 1908 against New Zealand, and England, and won a cap for Great Britain while at Halifax in 1911 against Australia"]}, {"page": "Burgham, Oliver", "response": ["#redirectOliver Burgham"]}]}}
