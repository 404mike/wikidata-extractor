These results were just enough to ensure that he would remain on tour for another year. The next season, Wilson twice reached the last 64 stage of the tournaments, however the rest of his performances was unsuccessful and following defeat to James Tatton in the World Championship qualifying he fell off the tour. In 2013 Wilson commented: \"At the end of it, when you looked at the rankings it was only by one match and I was gutted. The thing is, at the time, and this is not an excuse, the game was nowhere near as popular as now. It was going through a really bad patch and there were only six tournaments in all compared to now when there are 20\u201325 tournaments per season. It meant if you had two bad tournaments and you were not doing too well you did not have much time to recover. It is so different now.\""]}, {"page": "Tatton, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Tatton"]}]}}
