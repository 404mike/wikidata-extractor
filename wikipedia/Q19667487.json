Turner was a member of the Trotskyite Militant group in the Labour Party, but remained in Labour when many Militant members left to form the Socialist Party. Turner was seen as more willing to work with the Labour leader Keir Starmer, whereas Beckett said that Starmer needed \"to be held to account\". Turner was chosen as United Left's candidate in a ballot, winning by 370 votes to 367. Beckett challenged the result, but Turner's victory was upheld after reports into the conduct of the vote were completed. Beckett later announced he would still stand as a candidate.

The other participant, Howard Beckett, continued as a candidate without the support of United Left. Graham, although also considered to be on the left-wing of the union, ran in the election without seeking the faction's endorsement. She said she was \"not a member of any Unite or Labour faction other than [her] own supporters group\". Her campaign was focused on redirecting attention towards workers' rights and workplaces instead of engaging with the internal politics of the Labour Party, of which Unite is an affiliated trade union. After the close of nominations, Beckett withdrew from the election and endorsed Turner. McCluskey also endorsed Turner, and members pressured Graham to withdraw and support Turner to prevent Gerard Coyne, a centrist candidate, from becoming general secretary. Graham declined to do so, and received online abuse for her decision to remain a candidate. Her election campaign was supported by the Socialist Workers Party and the Socialist Party."]}]}}
