Instead he was given command of Northumbrian Division in September 1911. Despite his shell shock, upon the outbreak of the First World War, he was put in command of West Lancashire Division in August 1914 and shortly thereafter of the newly formed 11th (Northern) Division, part of Kitchener's volunteer army. In this capacity, Hammersley commanded the Landing at Suvla Bay by his division during the Gallipoli Campaign. However, his ability to oversee such an operation was subsequently called into question, and the Dardanelles Commission openly criticised his command. The orders given by General Hammersley were deemed to be confused and the work of his staff defective.Paragraphs 108 and 109 of the Dardanelles Commission final report, 1919 On 23 August 1915, he was removed from the front-line in a state of collapse and was replaced by Major-General Edward Fanshawe.Alan Moorehead, Gallipoli (Harper Perennial Modern Classics; Reprint edition, 2002), 102.

Gough suggested that the Fifth Army could support the attack but for lack of means, only on a narrow front and Bullecourt was substituted for Qu\u00e9ant, which was a much more formidable objective, behind four defensive positions. The attack would then pivot to the right flank to capture the junction of the Hindenburg Line and the Drocourt\u2013Qu\u00e9ant Switch Line (). If successful, the 4th Cavalry Division would pass through to meet the Cavalry Corps from Arras. Fifth Army attacks on 2 April captured the German outpost villages from Doignies to Croisilles and Gough ordered that risks be taken to advance as much heavy artillery as possible. On 5 April Gough issued orders to the two Fifth Army corps V Corps (Lieutenant-General Edward Fanshawe) and 1st Anzac Corps (Lieutenant-General William Birdwood) for an attack on a  front with Bullecourt in the centre."]}]}}
