Parry returned to international football to win one more cap in a friendly match against Georgia before causing another shock by announcing his retirement from internationals at the age of 28, later stating that he felt like a \"spare part\" in the Wales team after being overlooked during a 2010 World Cup qualifying match against Azerbaijan."]}, {"page": "1970 in Wales", "response": ["*2 April \u2013 Jason Perry, footballer"]}, {"page": "Cardiff City F.C.", "response": ["Known as the South Wales derby, Cardiff City's most significant rivalry is with nearby neighbours Swansea City, and over 100 games have been played in all competitions between the sides. Swansea's first competitive match following their founding in 1912 was against Cardiff in the Southern Football League. The rivalry had been relatively friendly until the 1970s and 1980s. Economic issues, such as the UK miners' strike, rivalry between the two cities and an increase in football hooliganism led to numerous violent clashes between fans at the matches. One game in 1993 was dubbed \"The Battle of Ninian Park\" for its particularly severe violence and resulted in away fans being banned from attending any matches between the sides for four years. Cardiff player Jason Perry described the period as \"the dark, dark days of the derby\". When the ban was dropped, \"bubble trips\" were introduced for away fans who could only attend matches via police-escorted convoys to and from the stadium."]}, {"page": "List of Bristol Rovers F.C. international players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Jason Perry||||1||1994||1997\u20131998"]}, {"page": "Jason Perry (football player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jason Perry (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Cardiff City F.C.
