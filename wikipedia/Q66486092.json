A classicist, he was a master at Winchester College from 1910 to 1915; and from 1919 to 1922: during World War One he was an officer with the Royal Garrison Artillery. in 1922 he became a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford.

She had just graduated from St Anne's College, Oxford, having read History, and was starting a BLitt. They were married in July 1953, and lived in Oxford until 1955, when Goff went to the Bar. As a young academic couple, they became good friends with various academics, including Jack Butterworth, Maurice Platnauer, and Tom Boase. They shared a love for opera, which Goff encouraged in their children. They had four children, one of whom died young. The family lived in London until 1975, and then moved to Chieveley House in Berkshire."]}, {"page": "History of Brasenose College, Oxford", "response": ["Brasenose's finances entered the second half of the century in poor shape, and considerably worse than the period between 1930 and 1931, slipping relative to other colleges from 3rd to 8th. But they were improved during Last's tenure, along with undergraduate admissions; the college showed a surplus in 1952\u20131953, and income in 1957 (\u00a3104,000) was double what it had been in 1938. Pay for fellows was still poor, and they were small in number compared to other colleges. There was a sizeable entertainment budget, however, something which, combined with the long hours, may have contributed to short lifespans. Only in 1987 did a sitting fellow reach retirement age.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0385\u2013386. Last resigned as principal in 1956, dying shortly after.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0393. Turnover was considerable, although some fellows stayed on: Maurice Platnauer became principal in 1956, and retired in 1960; he was replaced by Sir Noel Hall.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0387. Hall's tenure was troubled, not externally, but rather from Hall's patchy knowledge of the college and staff; his selection, faute de mieux, was sometimes questioned, although he remained well-liked. However, the college, which had thus far stayed assured, found itself in a changing environment.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0387\u2013388. Herbert Hart, however, principal between 1973 and 1978, was the first to be elected from outside Brasenose.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0417. Lord Windlesham, made principal in 1989, was the first to hold Cabinet Office.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0432."]}, {"page": "L. D. Reynolds", "response": ["The post of Classics tutor at Brasenose College, Oxford, had fallen vacant after its incumbent, Maurice Platnauer, had become the college's new Principal. In 1957, after the end of his research fellowship, Reynolds was selected as Platnauer's replacement and duly elected to a tutorial fellowship. He was also appointed a University Lecturer in Greek and Latin Literature. He would hold both appointments for the rest of his academic career. Reynolds played an active part in the college's governing body, where, according to the Brasenose fellow and chemist Graham Richards, he \"held a position of quiet authority\". From 1985 to 1987, he served as Vice-Principal and, in 1997, as acting Principal of the college. He supported Brasenose's decision to become the first all-male college of the university to admit female students. In 1996 he was raised to the rank of a professor.
