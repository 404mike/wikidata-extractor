The Earl presented copies of I quattro libri dell'architettura and De architectura to Soane.Darley, 1999, p. 28 In December the Earl introduced Soane to Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, an acquaintance which would lead eventually to architectural commissions.Darley, 1999 p. 29 The Earl persuaded Soane to accompany him to Naples, setting off from Rome on 22 December 1778. On the way they visited Capua and the Palace of Caserta,Darley, 1999, p. 30 arriving in Naples on 29 December. It was there that Soane met two future clients, John Patteson and Richard Bosanquet.Darley, 1999, p. 33 From Naples Soane made several excursions including to Pozzuoli, Cumae and Pompeii, where he met yet another future client, Philip Yorke.Darley, 1999, pp. 33\u201336 Soane also attended a performance at Teatro di San Carlo and climbed Mount Vesuvius.Darley, 1999, p. 35 Visiting Paestum, Soane was deeply impressed by the Greek temples.Darley, 1999 p. 38 Next he visited the Certosa di Padula,Darley, 1999 P.39 then went on to Eboli and Salerno and its cathedral.

Soane visited the Villa Palagonia, which made a deep impact on him.Darley, 1999, pp. 44\u201345 Influenced by the account of the Villa in his copy of Patrick Brydone's Tour through Sicily and Malta, Soane savoured the \"Prince of Palagonia's Monsters\u00a0... nothing more than the most extravagant caricatures in stone\", but more significantly seems to have been inspired by the Hall of Mirrors to introduce similar effects when he came to design the interiors of his own house in Lincoln's Inn Fields.Edward Chaney, The Evolution of the Grand Tour (London, 2000), pp. 32\u201336 Leaving Palermo from where the party split, Stuart and Bowdler going off together.
