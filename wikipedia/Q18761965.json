However, this is due to the fact that the original translator, M. Thory, in his Acta Latomorum, cleaned up and standardized the text, which was later mistaken for a literal translation. The former owner of the Charter, Fred J.W. Crowe published a literal translation of the Charter in Transactions of the Quatuor Coronati Lodge, 1911, showing the Latin is consistent with the fourteenth century. Crowe then submitted the Charter for examination to Sir George Warner, Keeper of the Manuscripts at the British Museum, who also determined the Latin to be of the fourteenth century, consistent with the claims of the Charter."]}]}}
