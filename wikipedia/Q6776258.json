The library no longer had a major display of its James Joyce materials, and the museum was originally conceived as an exposition of the work of Joyce, to be called Ulysses House.  Joyce himself had studied at both Newman House and the National Library.  The charitable foundation of Martin Naughton and his wife funded an initial study, and after discussion with Failte Ireland, which offered to join funding to the tune of 2.5 million euro, the concept was expanded to take in Irish literature in general. The Naughtons added further significant funding, amounting to nearly half the total, and UCD raised 2.5 million euro of additional funds. In formulating a name for the expanded project, a Joycean link was deemed important, so a name was devised, the acronym of which would relate to his work - hence MoLI (pronounced \"Molly\") in homage to Molly Bloom."]}, {"page": "List of people from Dundalk", "response": ["*Martin Naughton, entrepreneur founded GlenDimplex. #11 on the Irish Independent Rich List 2017."]}, {"page": "Margaret Heffernan (Irish businesswoman)", "response": ["Heffernan is a teetotaler, and stated to be religious.
