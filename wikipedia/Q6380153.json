As more West Indians arrived in Britain,  the more radical elements of the black community also joined the CPGB, with many of them seeing Strachan as their leader. His communist activism as a CPGB member put him into contact with many influential British communists and socialists including Kay Beauchamp, Palme Dutt, and Cheddi Jagan. Strachan also lived temporarily with another Afro-Caribbean communist leader living in Britain called Trevor Carter, the cousin of famous Black-British civil rights activist Claudia Jones who founded Britain's first major black newspaper. Culturally he also came into contact with the works of communist musicians including Alan Bush, A. L. Lloyd, Ewan MacColl, and the dramas of Bertolt Brecht.
