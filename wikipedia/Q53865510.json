These were the first findings on hosts other than Fraxinus anywhere in the world. All three new hosts are in the same taxonomic family as ash, the Oleaceae. The trees were all in the vicinity of infected European ash. In response to the findings on the new hosts, Nicola Spence, the UK Chief Plant Health Office, said that, \"Landscapers, gardeners and tree practitioners should be vigilant for signs of ash dieback on these new host species, and report suspicious findings through Tree Alert\"."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Birkbeck, University of London", "response": ["* Nicola Spence, Chief Plant Health Officer, Defra"]}, {"page": "Ash Archive", "response": ["The Ash Archive is a project founded in 2019 to restore ash trees to the landscape in England. English ash trees experienced massive dieback beginning in 2012 as a result of a fungal pathogen, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. The archive contains over 3,000 trees, all of which propagated from the shoots of trees that had demonstrated some resistance to the fungus. The archive was established with \u00a31.9 million (about USD 2.5 million) in government funding, and followed a five-year project to identify ash trees that were resistant to the fungus. One of the final trees in the archive was planted in January 2020 by Nicola Spence, the Chief Plant Health Officer of the UK government. Spence said, \"I\u2019m delighted to acknowledge the successes of the Ash Archive project and welcome the International Year of Plant Health by planting an ash dieback-tolerant tree.\""]}, {"page": "2022 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Professor Nicola Jane Horsley (Nicola Spence), Deputy Director, Plant and Bee Health and Chief Plant Health Officer, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
