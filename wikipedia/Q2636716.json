Harper is best remembered for playing in the Championship winning Everton side of the mid-1980s.\nHarper was a utility player whose first-choice position was right-back but he could perform competently in almost any position on the park and he frequently turned up in central defence, at left-back, centre midfield, wide midfield and sometimes even as a makeshift striker. Perhaps partially as a result of his great versatility however, he often found himself used as a squad player rather than as a first-team regular at many of the clubs he played for. He is remembered as a largely unspectacular but solid and reliable performer who very rarely made a mistake. Harper scored few goals but many of those he did score were spectacular efforts, often from long range. Everton fans nicknamed him 'Bertie Bassett' because he played in 'allsorts of positions'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Everton F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Alan Harper||||FB||1983\u20131988, 1991\u20131993||240||5"]}, {"page": "Merseyside derby", "response": ["* Alan Harper \u2013 1983 \u2013 \u00a3100,000; though on Liverpool's books, he never made a first-team appearance.", "|| Alan Harper||1983\u201319881991\u20131993||"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.

He made 14 starts in the 1987\u201388 season, mostly deputising for Kenny Clements. He was the first-choice right back in the first half of the 1988\u201389 season, in which City gained promotion to the First Division, but his season was ended in February by a cracked vertebra. His first team opportunities were limited the following season. A brief opportunity arrived after Machin was sacked in November 1989, but Seagraves made just two appearances before new manager Howard Kendall brought in Alan Harper as a new right-back.
