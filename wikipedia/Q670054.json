In 1823, the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described and figured Rudolphi's specimen under the name \"rorqual du Nord\". In 1828, Rene Lesson translated this term into Balaenoptera borealis, basing his designation partly on Cuvier's description of Rudolphi's specimen and partly on a 54-ft female that had stranded on the coast of France the previous year (this was later identified as a juvenile fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus).

One subspecies was proposed by Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala in 1945, P. c. meridionalis, though there was not sufficient justification, and William Henry Flower suggested in 1884 and later abandoned a distinction between northern and southern false killer whales; there are currently no recognized subspecies. However, individuals in populations around the world can have different skull structures and vary in average length, with Japanese false killer whales being 10\u201320% larger than South African false killer whales.

According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, \u00c9.\u00a0Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, in which he included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared the structure of the nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used.

His dissections enabled him to correlate many facts for the first time, and his results were set forth in his lectures.
