Thomas began his professional career in 2002, playing for the Haringey Racers in the ENIL.  Thomas took up ice hockey much later than most players but was able to thrive due to his natural talent and physical abilities.  Thomas began playing ice hockey at Under-19 after watching his local team, the now-defunct Manchester Storm, then playing in the ISL.\nThomas would start with a strong showing in his first season, when he played in 22 games and totalled 63 penalty minutes as well as helping out the offence with seven points.  For the start of the 2003\u201304 season Thomas was a Telford Wildfoxes player, but played just once before being snapped up by then Manchester Phoenix head coach, Rick Brebant to play for the Phoenix in their debut season.  The Phoenix had been established following the collapse of the Storm, the team that had inspired Thomas to start to play ice hockey in the first place.\nThomas was an important part of the Phoenix's first season and played in 52 EIHL regular season games and featured six times in the play-offs. The Phoenix organisation was suspended in 2004 due to off ice problems and so Thomas was forced into moving.  In the summer of 2004 he chose to sign for the London Racers, where he stayed for a season-and-a-half.  It was financial problems that again forced Thomas to move, with the Racers franchise folding mid-way through the 2005\u201306 season.\nThis mid-season move brought Thomas to sign for the Sheffield Steelers, arch-rivals of the Phoenix whom Thomas had played for just two years earlier.  Thomas established himself as a key part of the Steelers defence, and was a rare British star player surrounded by foreign imports.  It was that consistency that saw \"Tomo\" remain a fan favourite with the Steelers organisation for 10 seasons, and in 2015, he was rewarded with a testimonial season.\nVarious events were held in his testimonial year, including a testimonial match which saw many former Steelers, including Scott Basiuk and Steve Munn, return to Sheffield.\nOn 6 May 2015, it was announced that Mark Thomas was returning to his home town team, the EPL's Manchester Phoenix, who he had previously played for in their inaugural season in 2003\u201304.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Thomas (disambiguation)", "response": ["Mark Thomas (born 1963) is British comedian and political activist.", "Mark Thomas may also refer to:", "*Mark Thomas (MP), English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1659", "*Mark Thomas (newspaper editor) (born 1967), former editor of The People", "*Mark Thomas (defensive end) (born 1969), American football defensive end", "*Mark Thomas (tight end) (born 1976), American football tight end", "*Mark Thomas (cricketer) (born 1977), English cricketer", "*Mark Thomas (ice hockey) (born 1983), English ice hockey player", "*Mark Thomas (bank robber),  a member of the Aryan Republican Army, who robbed 22 Midwest US banks", "*Mark Thomas (flutist), American flutist", "*Mark Thomas (rugby league), Australian rugby league footballer", "*Mark Thomas (weightlifter) (born 1963), British weightlifter"]}, {"page": "2009 IIHF World Championship Division I rosters", "response": ["|Mark Thomas"]}]}}
