The six-month tour was extended to almost six years, and during two subsequent tours the British Blondes drew large crowds at leading theatres across the US. The troupe launched the careers of several actors, including Markham, Alice Burville, Lisa Weber and Rose Coghlan, and of comedian Willie Edouin. It also drew fierce criticism from those who felt it transgressed the boundaries of propriety. Burlesques, colloquially referred to as leg-shows, started off tame, clever and sophisticated, drawing in all types of people, especially women.
