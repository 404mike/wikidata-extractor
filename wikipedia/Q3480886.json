Diogenes La\u00ebrtius Lives 3.37). What is remarkable about Campbell's conclusions is that, in spite of all the stylometric studies that have been conducted since his time, perhaps the only chronological fact about Plato's works that can now be said to be proven by stylometry is the fact that Critias, Timaeus, Laws, Philebus, Sophist, and Statesman are the latest of Plato's dialogues, the others earlier.", "* Lewis Campbell, scholar and author of commentaries"]}, {"page": "University of St Andrews", "response": ["*Lewis Campbell"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Jowett", "response": ["In the midst of other labours, Jowett had been quietly exerting his influence so as to conciliate all shades of liberal opinion, and bring them to bear upon the abolition of the theological test, which was still required for the M.A. and other degrees, and for university and college offices. He spoke at an important meeting upon this question in London on 10 June 1864, which laid the ground for the Universities Tests Act 1871. Directly after, he had made as Master, Balliol College \"a sort of heaven on earth\" in 1870.Jowett Letters, xxvi-xxvii Speaking of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, the emerging world religion, to his eminent pupil and classicist Professor Lewis Campbell, \"This Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Movement is the greatest light that has come into the world since the time of Jesus Christ.

The shock waves reverberated through the liberal establishment into the founding of the Labour Party and the New Liberalism of the Great War.", "Meanwhile, the tutorships in other colleges, and some of the headships also, were being filled with Balliol men, and Jowett's former pupils were prominent in both houses of parliament and at the bar. He continued the practice, which he had commenced in 1848, of taking with him a small party of undergraduates in vacation time, and working with them in one of his favourite haunts, at Askrigg in Wensleydale, or Tummel Bridget or later at West Malvern. Included in this list was Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge who became recognised as equal to the great classical scholar Theodor Mommsen. The new hall (1876), the organ there, entirely his gift (1835) and the cricket ground (1889), remain as external monuments of the master's activity. Neither business nor the many claims of friendship interrupted literary work. The six or seven weeks of the long vacation, during which he had pupils with him, were mainly employed in writing. The translation of Aristotle's Politics, the revision of Plato, and, above all, the translation of Thucydides many times revised, occupied several years. The edition of the Republic, undertaken in 1856, remained unfinished, but was continued with the help of Professor Lewis Campbell."]}, {"page": "Gifford Lectures", "response": ["*1894\u201396 Lewis Campbell Religion in Greek Literature"]}, {"page": "Electra (Sophocles play)", "response": ["* Lewis Campbell, 1883 \u2013 verse"]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford academics", "response": ["* Lewis Campbell, classicist"]}, {"page": "Theodor Gomperz", "response": ["Lewis Campbell gives an overview of Gomperz as writer and scholar in The Hibbert Journal, 5:2, January 1907, pp.\u00a0439\u2013448."]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["* Lewis Campbell, classical scholar"]}, {"page": "Women of Trachis", "response": ["* 1906 \u2013 Lewis Campbell: verse"]}, {"page": "John Burnet (classicist)", "response": ["Burnet was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, the University of Edinburgh, and Balliol College, Oxford, receiving his M.A. degree in 1887.

The first year had been full, obliging him to join the second year with classmates a year his senior. His mannerisms and Galloway accent struck the other boys as rustic. Having arrived on his first day of school wearing a pair of homemade shoes and a tunic, he earned the unkind nickname of \"Daftie\". He never seemed to resent the epithet, bearing it without complaint for many years. Social isolation at the Academy ended when he met Lewis Campbell and Peter Guthrie Tait, two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life.
