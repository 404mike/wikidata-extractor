The Club was one of the first institutions to voice concerns about the impact on the environment of unprecedented economic growth in the twentieth century. \"Peccei and King were lonely prophets at a time of overwhelming optimism,\" who did much to push environmental issues on to the political agenda. At the time of the Club's founding, King was Director-General for Scientific Affairs at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
