The Club was one of the first institutions to voice concerns about the impact on the environment of unprecedented economic growth in the 20th century. \"Peccei and King were lonely prophets at a time of overwhelming optimism,\" who did much to push environmental issues on to the political agenda. At the time of the Club's founding, King was Director-General for Scientific Affairs at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Idries Shah", "response": ["Shah was an early member and supporter of the Club of Rome,Some sources have described Shah as a \"founding member\" of the Club of Rome.

It occupied would-be students and opponents alike, and inflamed critics to quite amazing degree. A lot of it was fake: Shah knew perfectly well that he was not a founding member of the Club of Rome; he was a member for a short time and was politely asked to leave because he didn't turn up to meetings; but this mythology around Shah's public personage was necessary in order to provide the dream-lie without which no truth can exist, because a student must always have a choice.\"() and several presentations were given to the Institute by scientists like Alexander King."]}, {"page": "Club of Rome", "response": ["The Club of Rome was founded in April 1968 by Aurelio Peccei, an Italian industrialist, and Alexander King, a Scottish scientist. It was formed when a small international group of people from the fields of academia, civil society, diplomacy, and industry met at Villa Farnesina in Rome, hence the name.", "In 1991, the club published The First Global Revolution. It analyses the problems of humanity, calling these collectively or in essence the \"problematique\". It notes that, historically, social or political unity has commonly been motivated by enemies in common: \"The need for enemies seems to be a common historical factor. Some states have striven to overcome domestic failure and internal contradictions by blaming external enemies. The ploy of finding a scapegoat is as old as mankind itself\u2014when things become too difficult at home, divert attention to adventure abroad. Bring the divided nation together to face an outside enemy, either a real one, or else one invented for the purpose. With the disappearance of the traditional enemy, the temptation is to use religious or ethnic minorities as scapegoats, especially those whose differences from the majority are disturbing.\"Alexander King & Bertrand Schneider. The First Global Revolution (The Club of Rome), 1993. p. 70 \"Every state has been so used to classifying its neighbours as friend or foe, that the sudden absence of traditional adversaries has left governments and public opinion with a great void to fill. New enemies have to be identified, new strategies imagined, and new weapons devised.\" \"In searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together. But in designating these dangers as the enemy, we fall into the trap, which we have already warned readers about, namely mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.\"King & Schneider, p. 115", "* Alexander King (1909\u20132007), President of the Club of Rome 1984\u20131990, founding member"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish scientists", "response": ["| Alexander King"]}, {"page": "Erasmus Prize", "response": ["| 100px || 1987 || Alexander King || || "]}, {"page": "Aurelio Peccei", "response": ["Aurelio Peccei (; 4 July 1908 \u2013 14 March 1984), was an Italian industrialist and philanthropist, best known as co-founder with Alexander King and first president of the Club of Rome, an organisation which attracted considerable public attention in 1972 with its report, The Limits to Growth.", "Peccei's speech caught the attention of Dean Rusk, then US Secretary of State, who had it translated into English and distributed at various meetings in Washington. A Soviet representative at the annual meeting of the United Nations Advisory Committee on Science and Technology (ACAST), Jermen Gvishiani, Alexei Kosygin's son-in-law and vice-chairman of the State Committee on Science and Technology of the Soviet Union, read the speech and was so taken by it that he decided he should invite the author to come for private discussions, outside Moscow. Gvishiani therefore asked an American colleague on ACAST, Carroll Wilson, about Peccei. Wilson did not know Peccei, but he and Gvishiani both knew Alexander King, by then Director General for Scientific Affairs for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, so Wilson appealed to him for information.", "After the meeting there was an informal gathering of a few people in Peccei's home, which included Erich Jantsch (one of the great methodologists of planning studies), Alexander King, Hugo Thiemann, Lauro Gomes-Filho, Jean Saint-Geours, and Max Kohnstamm. According to King, within an hour they had decided to call themselves the Club of Rome and had defined the three major concepts that have formed the club's thinking ever since: a global perspective, the long-term, and the cluster of intertwined problems they called \"the problematique\". Although the Rome meeting had been convened with just Western Europe in mind, the group realised that they were dealing with problems of much larger scale and complexity\u2014in short, \"the predicament of mankind\". The notion of problematique excited some because it seemed applicable at a universal level, but worried others, who felt that the approach was valid only for smaller entities such as a city or community. Saint-Geours and Kohnstamm therefore soon dropped out, leaving the others to pursue their informal programme of learning and debate."]}, {"page": "Alexander King", "response": ["Alexander King may refer to:", "*Alexander King (footballer) (1871\u20131957), Scottish footballer", "*Alexander King (author) (1899\u20131965), U.S. humorist, memoirist, and TV personality", "*Alexander King (scientist) (1909\u20132007), British sustainable development pioneer", "*Alexander King (MP) (fl. 1588\u20131601), British MP for Bishop's Castle"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2007", "response": ["*Alexander King, 98, British scientist who co-founded the Club of Rome."]}, {"page": "The Institute for Cultural Research", "response": ["* co-founder of the Club of Rome in 1968, Dr. Alexander King (Science, Technology and the Quality of LifeAlexander King, Science, Technology and the Quality of Life, The Institute for Cultural Research, 1972, , . and An Eye to the FutureDr. Alexander King et al., An Eye to the Future, Institute for Cultural Research, .)SourceWatch article on Alexander King Retrieved on 2008-11-14."]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* Alexander King (1909\u20132007), chemist"]}, {"page": "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)", "response": ["* Alexander King, Co-Founder of the Club of Rome (archive)"]}, {"page": "Michael Peckham", "response": ["He was married to Catherine Peckham,http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/p/9531/Catherine+Stevenson.aspx daughter of Alexander King."]}, {"page": "Catherine Peckham", "response": ["Peckham was born in London, spent her early years in the US and she was educated at St Paul's Girls' School and University College London.
