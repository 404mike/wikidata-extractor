Being an artificial harbour, the port was vulnerable to cyclones and accretion of sand inside the basin due to underwater currents, which reduced the draft. To charter the course of the port development, Spring, who assumed charge as the chief engineer of the port in 1906, drew a long-term plan in a scientific manner to overcome challenges, both artificial and natural. The shifting of the entrance of the port from eastern side to the northeastern side protected the port to a large extent from the natural vulnerabilities. By this time, the port covered an area of 400 acres. By the end of 1920, the port had a dock consisting of four berths in the west quays, one each in the east and south quay along with the transit sheds, warehouses and a marshalling yard to facilitate the transfer of cargo from land to sea and vice versa. In 1929, the Mercantile Marine Department, which was working directly under the Ministry of Shipping till the establishment of the Directorate General of Shipping at Mumbai in 1949, was established to implement the first SOLAS and Load Line conventions. Additional berths were added in the 1940s with a berth at south quay and another between WQ2 and WQ3. The year 1946 saw the establishment of the Port Health Organisation. In 1947, when India gained independence, Chennai became the capital of the Madras State, renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1969."]}, {"page": "Stephen Fry bibliography and filmography", "response": ["| Sir Francis Spring"]}, {"page": "Spring family", "response": ["The civil servant Sir Francis Spring (1849\u20131933), the army officer Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Spring Walker (1876-1941) and the Irish politician Dick Spring (b.1950) are also descended from the same family."]}, {"page": "Madras Legislative Council (1891\u20131909)", "response": ["|align=left| Francis Spring"]}, {"page": "Ramanujan (film)", "response": ["* Richard Walsh as Francis Spring"]}, {"page": "St Peter and St Paul's Church, Lavenham", "response": ["The two principal donors for church were the 13th Earl of Oxford and the cloth merchant, Thomas Spring of Lavenham.
