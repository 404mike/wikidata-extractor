One of the oldest yards was that of Sime & Rankine, who in July 1823 delivered the paddle-steamer Quentin Durward to R. Ogilvie and G. Crichton of Leith. The name was taken from the title of a historical novel by Sir Walter Scott, published in 1823. The ship's first recorded voyage with passengers - in August 1823 - was the long journey North and West from Leith via Aberdeen, Inverness, the Caledonian Canal, Fort William, Tobermory, Staffa, Giant's Causeway, Coleraine, Campbeltown and Kyles of Bute to Glasgow. On arrival the steamship was put up for sale. Apparently no sale took place, and in September 1823 the Quentin Durward made another long journey with passengers, this time from Greenock via Dublin, Plymouth and Portsmouth to Brighton. At the end of the trip, the ship was immediately employed on a route between Brighton and Dieppe in France. In April 1824 the Quentin Durward was chartered by the Leith & Dundee Steam Packet Co in Leith, and it commenced sailing on the route between Leith and Dundee the same month. In April 1826 the paddle-wheeler was back in the Channel, now employed on a route between Newhaven and Grangemouth. That turned out to be a short engagement, because the following month the ship was bought by The Brighton & Dieppe Steam Packet Co. in Brighton and once again sailed between Brighton and Dieppe. In June 1827 the paddle-wheeler was bought by  (lieutenant commander) Laurits Christensen and her name was changed to Dania. In spite of his naval rank, Christensen\u2014his first name also spelled Lauritz\u2014had not done active service since 1814, and his status as a reservist had enabled him to do business in the East Indies from 1816 til 1826.
