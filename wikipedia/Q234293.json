Her accolades include a Golden Globe Award and a David di Donatello Award. The daughter of Argentine opera singer Andr\u00e9s Osuna, Hussey was born in Buenos Aires but spent the majority of her early life in her mother's native England. She aspired to become an actress at a young age  and studied drama for five years at London's Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts.\nHussey began acting professionally as an adolescent and appeared in a 1966 London production of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, opposite Vanessa Redgrave. This led to her being scouted for the role of Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Hussey received widespread acclaim and international recognition for her performance.\nIn 1974, she appeared as the lead character Jess Bradford in the cult slasher film Black Christmas. This role, along with her subsequent horror films, earned her the title of scream queen. She reunited with Zeffirelli in the miniseries Jesus of Nazareth (1977) as Mary and appeared in John Guillermin's Agatha Christie adaptation Death on the Nile (1978). She appeared in several international productions throughout the 1980s, including the Japanese production Virus (1980) and the Australian dystopian action film Turkey Shoot (1982). She appeared in two made-for-television horror productions: Psycho IV: The Beginning and Stephen King's It, both first screened in 1990.\nIn addition to screen acting, Hussey has worked as a voice actress, providing voice roles in multiple Star Wars video games, including Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Force Commander, and Star Wars: The Old Republic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 17", "response": ["*1951 \u2013 Olivia Hussey, Argentinian-English actress"]}, {"page": "Psycho (1960 film)", "response": ["Three sequels were produced after Hitchcock died: Psycho II (1983), Psycho III (1986), and Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990), the last being a part-prequel television movie written by the original screenplay author, Joseph Stefano.

When his wife becomes pregnant, he lures her to his mother's house and tries to kill her, wanting to prevent another of his \"cursed\" line from being born into the world; the film implies that Mrs. Bates (Olivia Hussey) suffered from schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder and passed the illnesses on to her son. However, he relents at the last minute, when Connie professes her love for him. He then burns the house down in an attempt to free himself of his past. During the attempt, he is tormented by hallucinations of \"Mother\" and several of his victims. He almost dies in the flames before willing himself to get out, apparently defeating his illness at long last; he is finally free of his mother's voice, which demands to be let out.
