City's title defence was not helped by a glaring error made by Hart which helped Southampton to a 3\u20131 win in February 2013. Hart dropped a tame Rickie Lambert shot and let it squirm between his legs, which allowed Steven Davis to turn it over the line. Earlier in the season Hart had made a significant error against Sunderland which gifted them a 1\u20130 win, being beaten at his near post by a low Adam Johnson shot after some poor positioning. He also made a notable error in a match against West Ham on 27 April 2013, letting a Andy Carroll half-volley that was struck right at him squirm through his body. However, City still went on to win the match 2\u20131. Hart started in goal for Manchester City in the 2013 FA Cup Final against Wigan Athletic but let in a 90th-minute header by Ben Watson; Wigan won 1\u20130, and City ended the season without winning a trophy. Manager Roberto Mancini made negative comments about Hart's performances throughout the season. His form continued to dip in the 2013\u201314 Premier League season. On 25 August 2013, Hart made a crucial mistake from a corner that led to a 3\u20132 win for strugglers Cardiff City. Hart then made two mistakes in the same match against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on 3 October 2013 that led to 2 goals being conceded. After a communication mix-up with defender Matija Nastasi\u0107 led to a decisive 90th-minute goal by Fernando Torres in a 2\u20131 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 27 October, he was replaced by Costel Pantilimon for a home match against Norwich City which City won 7\u20130. A month later, Hart returned to the Manchester City team for a Champions League group match against Viktoria Plze\u0148. Hart regained his place as City's starting goalkeeper in the Premier League in a 4\u20132 win over Fulham on 21 December 2013, and remained first choice as the team went on to win the league for the second time in three seasons."]}, {"page": "1985 in association football", "response": ["* July 9 \u2013 Ben Watson, English footballer"]}, {"page": "David Silva", "response": ["On 19 January 2013, Silva scored twice against Fulham at home in a 2\u20130 win.
