He also leads The Preference Laboratory, an international interdisciplinary team at The Dartmouth Institute, examining the implementation of shared decision making into clinical settings, using tools and measures such as collaboRATE, a patient experience measure of shared decision making, and Observer OPTION, a process measure for shared decision making for use on recorded data.\nHe holds chair appointments at the Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Netherlands, the Cochrane Institute for Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University, and at University College London. He is the lead editor of Shared Decision Making: Evidence Based Patient Choice, Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 2016.\nHe first completed an arts degree in Bangor, North Wales, where he was taught by Bedwyr Lewis Jones and Gwyn Thomas, before completing a medical degree in Cardiff. After training as a general medical practitioner, he set up a single-handed practice in the Docklands, the most deprived area of Cardiff, providing medical care to Somali refugees and the homeless as well as to the inhabitants of Butetown. His interest in practice development led to master's degree in medical education and after that to research on shared decision making and evidence-based medicine. He completed his PhD thesis under the supervision of Professor Richard Grol in Nijmegen, Netherlands.\nHe was previously appointed Professor of Primary Care at the Swansea Medical School (2002\u20132005) before being appointed Research Professor at Cardiff University where in collaboration with Professor Adrian Edwards, he led the Decision Laboratory, evaluating decision support interventions (also known as patient decision aids), tools that help clinicians achieve shared decision making, such as Prosdex, Aminodex, and Bresdex.\nElwyn developed and studies the use and impact of Option Grids patient decision aids, tools designed to support collaboration between clinicians and patients, and with  Marie-Anne Durand, formed the Option Grid Collaborative.  In 2017, the registered Option Grid trademark was licensed to EBSCO Health, who will be responsible for the further work required to develop evidence-based and up-to-date tools.\nUntil 2017, he co-chaired the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration with Professor Dawn Stacey. IPDAS has published quality assessment criteria  and a measurement instrument for tools to support patient participation in decision making.\nHe was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to shared decision making at the International Shared Decision Making Conference in Lima, Peru in 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cardiff University School of Medicine", "response": ["thumb|right|Glyn Elwyn", "*Glyn Elwyn, health services research and current Dartmouth College Professor"]}, {"page": "Shared decision-making in medicine", "response": ["The International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration, a group of researchers led by professors Annette O'Connor in Canada and Glyn Elwyn in the United Kingdom, has published a set of standards, representing the efforts of more than 100 participants from 14 countries around the world to will help determine the quality of patient decision aids. The IPDAS standards assist patients and health practitioners to assess the content, development process, and effectiveness of decision aids. According to IPDAS, certified decision aids should, for example, provide information about options, present probabilities of outcomes, and include methods for clarifying patients' values."]}]}}
