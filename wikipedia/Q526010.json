A left winger, he notably played in England, France and Spain, where he became the first ever British player to sign for Real Madrid.\nCunningham had signed a schoolboy contract with Arsenal in 1970, but was released in 1972 as his style of play was deemed incompatible with the Gunners\u2019 \u201cgive and go\u201d tactics.In 1974 he was picked up by second tier side Orient where he remained for 3 years. But it was following his move to West Bromwich Albion in 1977 that his career really took off. There he played alongside Cyrille Regis and Brendon Batson under coach Ron Atkinson, becoming only the second trio of black players to be fielded in the top flight of English football. They became known as 'the Three Degrees' - a term coined by Atkinson in reference to the American soul group of the same name.His form at the Hawthorns later earned a move to Real Madrid, where he remained for five years, winning La Liga once and the Copa del Rey twice. After a spell in France with Marseille, he returned to England with Leicester City in 1985, followed by a return to Spain with Rayo Vallecano. Cunningham signed with Wimbledon in 1988, where, as a member of the \"Crazy Gang\", he won the FA Cup in 1988 for the final trophy of his career.\nCunningham received his first international call-up to the England U21 side in 1977 while playing for West Bromwich Albion, becoming the first black footballer to represent an England international team organised by the Football Association. He later earned 6 caps for the full national team between 1979 and 1980, becoming one of the first ever black England internationals.\nWhile playing for Rayo Vallecano, Cunningham was killed in a car crash in Madrid on the morning of 15 July 1989, at the age of 33.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Beckham", "response": ["As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer, but instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for \u20ac37\u00a0million on a four-year contract.Equivalent to, at the time, \u00a325\u00a0million or US$41\u00a0million.
