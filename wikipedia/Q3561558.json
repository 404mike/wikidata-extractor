In the 1920s most Welsh victories were against France, then the weakest team in the Five Nations Championship; but in 1931 France were excluded from the tournament over accusations of professionalism at club level and were not readmitted until after the 1939 tournament, just before international rugby was suspended because of the Second World War. Welsh victories were now coming against the more established home nation teams. During this period, Wales won three Championships, but its greatest victory happened during the 1933 tournament when they finished last. Since its first international game in 1910, Wales had failed to beat England at Twickenham in nine attempts. Now dubbed the 'Twickenham bogey', it took the self confidence of Cardiff's Ronnie Boon to break the losing streak as he scored a try and a drop goal to take the match 7-3. The game also saw the debut of two players who would become Welsh greats, Wilf Wooller and Vivian Jenkins."]}, {"page": "2004 in Wales", "response": ["*5 January - Vivian Jenkins, rugby player, 92"]}, {"page": "London Welsh RFC", "response": ["*  Vivian Jenkins 1938"]}, {"page": "Oxford University RFC", "response": ["*  Vivian Jenkins"]}, {"page": "Llandovery College", "response": ["* Vivian Jenkins, British Lion"]}, {"page": "Stuart Lane", "response": ["Lane holds the unfortunate record of the shortest career of any Lions tourist, having been injured in the first minute of the opening game of the 1980 tour.

Davies was capped for Wales against Ireland under the captaincy of Joe Rees on 14 March 1936.

Davies was back the next season, playing two games in the championship though after the highs of the previous season, Wales lost all their games to end up with the Wooden Spoon. Davies missed the entirety of the 1938 tournament, but was back for the 1939 championship, playing in all three games. In the last match against Ireland Davies scored all seven points with a try and a drop goal for Wales. His drop goal was the last four point drop goal ever scored in the Five Nations Championship, and the last for Wales until the end of World War II.

In 1933 Boon was chosen to face England at Twickenham, a stadium Wales had failed to win at in ten attempts. Captained by Watcyn Thomas, Boon later argued that the Welsh forwards deserved all the credit for the Welsh victoryGoodwin (1984), pg 192. even though Boon scored all the Welsh points in a 7\u20133 victory. At half-time, England led the game 3\u20130 with a try from Walter Elliot; but soon after the restart, England's Ronald Gerrard kicked a loose ball across the ground straight into Boon's arms,Wales Rugby Union, Wales vs England Classics 1933 and he calmly drop kicked the ball through the posts to take a 4\u20133 lead. A few minutes later Boon had extended the lead when the ball came back from a maul to Davey, who passed to Boon, and with the English defence out of position, he crossed at the corner and touched the ball down behind the posts for a try. Vivian Jenkins converted the try which was registered on the score board, but strangely the referee would later disallow the attempt after the game. The decision did not change the result, and Wales had finally beaten the 'Twickenham bogey' and Boon was hailed as a Welsh hero. Boon missed the next game against Scotland due to a knee injury but was back to face Ireland. Wales lost the game and the Welsh selectors dropped 11 of the squad from future fixtures. Those that never played for Wales again after that game included Watcyn Thomas, Arthur Lemon, Harry Bowcott, Lonza Bowdler and Boon himself."]}, {"page": "1938 British Lions tour to South Africa", "response": ["* Vivian Jenkins (London Welsh)"]}, {"page": "List of cricket and rugby union players", "response": ["| Vivian Jenkins"]}]}}
