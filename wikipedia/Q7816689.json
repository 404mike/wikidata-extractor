The Major family (John, his parents, and his two older siblings Terry and Pat) lived at 260 Longfellow Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, a middle-class area where Major's father ran a garden ornaments business and his mother worked in a local library and as a part-time dance teacher. John Major later described the family's circumstances at this time as being \"comfortable but not well off.\" Following a German V-1 flying bomb attack in the area in 1944 which killed several people, the Majors moved to the village of Saham Toney, Norfolk for the duration of the war."]}, {"page": "Braddock, Pennsylvania", "response": ["*Tom Major-Ball - music hall performer and father of British Prime Minister John MajorJohn Major, The Autobiography, HarperCollins (1999), pp. 2-3."]}, {"page": "Music hall", "response": ["* Tom Major-Ball (1879\u20131962)"]}, {"page": "Garden gnome", "response": ["The reputation of German gnomes declined after World War I, but they became popular again in the 1930s following Disney's animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, when more working-class people were able to purchase them.
