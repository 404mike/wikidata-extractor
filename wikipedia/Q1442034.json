The most successful club in England had failed to keep pace with changes in the modern game; three of the five-man board of directors were over 70 years old, the club had neglected its scouting network and coaching structure and the club's finances were in a parlous state. This led to the club selling its top striker Tony Hateley to Chelsea for \u00a3100,000 in October 1966, without his goals Villa were relegated for the third time in its history, under manager Dick Taylor in 1967. The following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked Tommy Cummings (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 100. After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who brought in Doug Ellis as chairman. Doug Ellis's first managerial appointment was Tommy Docherty, who after initial success was sacked after 13 months in charge with the club at the foot of Second Division. His replacement was former club captain Vic Crowe, who could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time in its history at the end of the 1969\u201370 season.

Lee played in both legs of the 1961 final, which saw Villa defeat Rotherham United 3\u20132 on aggregate to become the inaugural winners of the competition. Villa finished seventh in 1961\u201362, before dropping to 15th in 1962\u201363.

(1961\u2013present)", "response": ["The late 1960s was a turbulent time for the club. The problems began when the club, under manager Dick Taylor, was relegated from the first tier of English football for the third time in 1967. Within two years, pressure from supporters led to the resignation of the board of directors. The club was then relegated to the Third Division. In the 1971\u201372 season, Aston Villa returned to the Second Division as champions with a record 70 points. In 1974 Ron Saunders was appointed manager, and by 1975 he led the club back into the First Division and into European competition. It continued to have much success under Saunders, winning the league in the 1980\u201381 season. Saunders' resignation halfway through the 1981\u201382 season came as a surprise, with the club in the quarter-final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his assistant manager Tony Barton who guided them to 1\u20130 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam. However, winning the cup marked a pinnacle, and the club fell steadily down the League standings over the next five years and was relegated in 1987. The club was promoted the following year, and achieved second place in the Football League in 1989 under manager Graham Taylor.", "Winning the League Cup in 1961 was a pinnacle for the club. Although Villa finished seventh in 1961\u201362, the following season saw the beginning of a decline in form that would see them finish in 15th place in 1963 and fourth from the bottom in 1964. Manager Joe Mercer parted company with the club in July 1964 because of these results and his declining health.Ward, Adam, p. 97, \"Mercer began to suffer ill health and in 1964 he left the club.\" His replacement, Dick Taylor, managed to avoid relegation in the 1964\u201365 season as Villa finished 16th after a poor start to the season.Ward, Adam, pp. 96\u201397 The following year Villa finished 16th once again. Following a 4\u20132 final day defeat by Everton the club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1966\u201367 season. Dick Taylor was sacked, and Tommy Cummings was appointed in his place. The decline was not solely the responsibility of the manager; the club had an ageing five-man board \"who had failed to adapt to the new football reality\".Ward, Adam, p. 98 The club had neither developed a scouting network nor an effective coaching structure. The board had also sold two of Villa's best players, Phil Woosnam and Tony Hateley.Ward, Adam, p. 96 \"...but more worryingly the club continued to lose its best players; Phil Woosnam... headed for America and Hateley left for Chelsea.\" The fans' calls for the board to resign became more and more pronounced when Villa finished 16th in the Second Division in 1968."]}, {"page": "Dick Taylor (disambiguation)", "response": ["Dick Taylor (born 1943), English musician, guitarist with The Pretty Things and early bass player for The Rolling Stones.", "Dick Taylor may also refer to:", "*Dick Taylor (Australian rules footballer) (1901\u20131962), Australian football centerman", "*Dick Taylor (football manager) (1918\u20131995), English football defender for Grimsby Town and Scunthorpe United, later manager of Aston Villa F.C.", "*Dick Taylor (Iowa politician) (born 1931), Iowa State Representative", "*Dick Taylor (athlete) (born 1945), British long-distance runner", "*Dick Taylor (footballer, born 1957), English football goalkeeper for Huddersfield Town and York City"]}, {"page": "Harry Burrows", "response": ["Burrows was born in Haydock and attracted the attentions of First Division clubs, Burnley, Liverpool, and Aston Villa whilst playing for Wigan Boys. He turned them all down including an offer from Stan Cullis at Wolverhampton Wanderers instead turning his attentions on becoming an apprentice with the National Coal Board (NCB). Villa manager Joe Mercer persuaded Burrows to sign part-time in March 1958 and he made his debut in 1959\u201360 as Villa won the Second Division title. He played and scored in the final of the inaugural League Cup in 1961 as Villa beat Rotherham United 3\u20132. Burrows won an England U23 cap against Greece and finished as Villa's top goalscorer in 1961\u201362 and 1962\u201363, although the departure of Mercer ended a golden period in Villa's history. The signings of new manager Dick Taylor all earned a higher basic wage then the existing Villa players which caused friction and one by one the players departed and Villa would end up languishing in the Third Division."]}]}}
