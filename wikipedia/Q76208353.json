A stained glass window in the church was the gift of Sir Arthur Hodgson in memory of the Hodgson family who did much for the Downs and for Queensland; the walls of the little church were beautifully decorated. The seats were tastefully decorated, and the organ, recently paid for, was a very fine instrument. All have been destroyed.\" The church was rebuilt with funds raised by the community. The foundation stone of the new building was laid on Wednesday 4 November 1914 by Archdeacon Henry Le Fanu, a week before the opening of the new Catholic church.

He didn't return to Australia until 1865. Soon after his return, he entered into partnership with his good friend Arthur Hodgson, later Sir Arthur Hodgson, by buying former station manager John Watts' share of Eton Vale, a substantial station on the eastern Darling Downs that Hodgson and his brother Christopher had established 25 years earlier, and which had only recently been secured against selection by use of the pre-emptive right and provisions of the Leasing Act of 1866. Following the formal dissolution in February 1866 of his partnership with Louis Hope, who was by then actively involved in Australia's burgeoning sugar industry, Ramsay and his family moved into the Eton Vale homestead from where he took over the day-to-day management of the station. The business partnership between Ramsay and Hodgson not only went on to become hugely successful in its own right but led to the formation of the much larger pastoral firm of Ramsay Brothers & Hodgson, a partnership between Robert Ramsay's sons Frank, Bob, Lauderdale, Douglas and Norman, and Arthur Hodgson's son Edward, that made most of its fortune from merino wool in and around Winton in central Queensland. Although Robert Ramsay and Arthur Hodgson remained firm friends until Hodgson's death in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1902, their business partnership ended in 1893 when Ramsay purchased a 35,000 acre (14,164 ha) portion of Eton Vale for himself. He named it Harrow after his sons' old school in England and because Arthur Hodgson was an old Etonian who had named Eton Vale after his old school."]}, {"page": "Thomas de Grey, 5th Baron Walsingham", "response": ["*Hon.
