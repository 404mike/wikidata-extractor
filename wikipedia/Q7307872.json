Although Brophy was normally a half back, he was drafted in as centre forward for the first three games of the 1938\u201339 season in the absence of Reg Tomlinson. Brophy scored in each of the first three games of the season before injury sidelined him for two games. All three of the games ended as defeats, setting the tone for the rest of the season. He came back into the side, this time at left half and scored again. After that flurry of goals, he only scored once more."]}, {"page": "Fred Briggs (footballer)", "response": ["In May 1938, he was signed on a free transfer by Second Division Southampton. Manager Tom Parker saw him as the ideal player to pair with Harry Osman up front. Briggs made his first start on 24 September 1938 in a defeat at Newcastle United, but soon settled into the side, forming a \"useful partnership\" with centre-forward Reg Tomlinson. In a run of twelve matches from mid-October to Christmas, he scored ten goals including a hat-trick at home to Swansea Town on 26 November. By the end of the season he was the Saints' top scorer with 14 goals."]}, {"page": "Doug McGibbon", "response": ["Doug McGibbon played his youth football with the Air Service Training at Hamble. During a charity cricket match, he approached the Southampton manager Tom Parker for a trial. Parker gave McGibbon a game with the \"Saints\" \"A\" team, against Lymington, during which he scored a hat trick. This was sufficient to persuade Southampton to offer him a professional contract, which he signed in December 1938, going on to make his first-team debut in the final match of the 1938\u201339 season, replacing Reg Tomlinson in a 2\u20130 defeat at Plymouth."]}, {"page": "Billy Bevis", "response": ["Bevis soon gained a reputation as a speedy right-winger and made 31 appearances in the 1937\u201338 season, scoring five goals. In the following season he only missed five matches, making 37 appearances and scoring six goals, including a \"spectacular\" hat-trick in a 3\u20131 victory at Swansea Town on 1 April 1939. His crosses also laid on scoring opportunities for the central forwards Reg Tomlinson and Fred Briggs who scored 12 and 14 league goals respectively, as the \"Saints\" finished 18th in the table, four points above the relegation zone. At the end of the season, Newcastle United made an enquiry about Bevis's availability."]}]}}
