He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\". He also dismissed the band's efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.\""]}, {"page": "State of Play (TV series)", "response": ["Reviewing the first episode for The Guardian newspaper the day after it had aired, Gareth McLean wrote that \"...it's bloody magic. The story is gripping, the acting is ace and Paul Abbott's script is outstanding. His ear for dialogue, and for different voices, is exceptional. The exposition is swift, nifty and joyously unclunky. The characters are credible and rounded. If you can count the best dramas of recent years on the fingers of both hands, it's time to grow a new finger.\" Other newspaper critics were similarly impressed with the opening instalment.

Fellow Guardian writer Paul Flynn observed in 2004 that Lancashire is \"assured her place in the national psyche\" because of Raquel, and when Lancashire starred in the 2009 BBC drama All the Small Things, The Guardian Lucy Mangan noted that she is \"still for many of us trailing clouds of the glorious Raquel Wolstenhulme\". In 2011, Raquel's wedding to Curly was placed eighteenth in Channel 5's \"Greatest TV Weddings\" programme. Producer Spencer Campbell thought the wedding was saddening, whilst critic Tina Baker felt she and everyone watching knew it was doomed for the pair.

Gareth McLean congratulated Marr for analysing the times in which he immerses himself, effortlessly communicating his enthusiasm, and hinting at fundamental truths of the human condition, which he stated was the future of factual programming. He was also impressed that Marr maintained his penetrating scrutiny and level of insight throughout the series.

James Walton of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a positive review, summarising it as \"a winning mixture of wild imagination and careful writerly calculation\". Alex Clark of The Observer commented that the death toll was rather high, but she still thought the episode was \"an oasis of cheeky nonsense and careless invention\". Harry Venning of The Stage concluded his positive review of the episode by stating it \"was well up to Doctor Whos impeccably high standards\". Doctor Who Magazine placed two of the deaths in the episode in its list of the top 100 deaths in the history of the show. Bannakaffalatta's death, a self-sacrifice to save the Doctor's party, was placed in the \"top 20 tearjerkers\" category. Astrid's death was given the title of \"Doctor Whos all-time greatest death scene\", commenting it \"ticks boxes in all of our main categories [(gruesome, scary, self-sacrifice, tearjerking, surprising)]\", and \"her death would truly make a glass eye cry.\" Tim Teeman of The Times gave the episode a negative review, stating that \"It was boring, despite the endless dashing about and CGI flimflam.\" The Daily Mirror commented the episode had \"some brilliant psychedelic Pink Floyd-esque imagery\", \"great baddies\", and \"neat jokes\", but lamented that \"the plot was a mess, consisting mostly of one hi-tech chase scene after another, and it descended into noise and bluster.\""]}, {"page": "The War on Britain's Jews?", "response": ["In the Guardian, Gareth McLean noted that \"Richard Littlejohn lecturing on the evils of bigotry is akin to Hannibal Lecter advocating vegetarianism.\" He added, \"there has been an alarming rise in anti-semitic hate crime recently in the UK, and [Littlejohn] endeavours to find out why the one minority he doesn't pick on is so vilified by everyone from bad Muslims to bad lefties to the far right.\""]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders characters (1993)", "response": ["Lucy Beale, played by Eva Brittin-Snell from 1993 to 1996, Casey Anne Rothery from 1996 until 2004, Melissa Suffield from 2004 to 2010 and Hetti Bywater from 2012 to 2015 is the daughter of Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins). She is the twin sister of Peter (Thomas Law), and has three half siblings, older brother Steven (Edward Savage, Aaron Sidwell), younger sister Cindy (Eva Sayer) and younger brother Bobby (Alex Francis). Apart from her on-screen birth, the character has few storylines of her own until 2004 when the role was recast to an older actress. Storylines featuring Lucy have since focused upon her teenage rebellion. In 2010, Suffield left EastEnders, after she was allegedly axed due to \"unruly behaviour.\" On 14 November 2011, it was announced Lucy would be returning in 2012 with Bywater taking over the role. She returned on 12 January 2012. In February 2014 it was announced that the character would be killed off. She made her final appearance on 22 April 2014 when her father goes to identify her body. In July 2007, Gareth McLean of The Guardian lamented the lack of strong female characters in EastEnders, noting that Lucy \"is yet to come into her own\".

Fan-funded music has gained popularity in the past few years however, money raised through these platforms still is only estimated to make up 1% of the amount spent on albums and tours. Many bands start off with fan funding to finance their initial album but then get signed to a record label. Major labels are signing artists with successful fan funded campaigns using the campaigns as a filter before investing in them. Other, more well-known bands have used fan funding to distance themselves from their label contracts and manage their own music. There has yet to be a band that has used fan funding to fully finance their career.
