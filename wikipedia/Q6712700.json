Grady Hendrix of Film Comment commented that the film was an \"embarrassment of riches\", summarising, \"... it's mockable, it's silly, it's cloaked in a cloying miasma of cute, but its off-handed facility with pop-cinema conventions, spiced up with some jarring stylistic disconnects, delivers the most mind-bending entertainment experience of the season. This is commercial moviemaking taken to its logical, mondo mercantilist conclusion.\" M. J. Simpson expressed approval of the entire cast, especially Hrithik Roshan, whom he regarded as the film's \"oddest aspect\". Calling it \"bright, loud and relentless fun\", J\u00fcrgen Fauth gave the film three-and-a-half-out-of-five stars and reviewed its comedic, romantic, science-fictional, musical, action, and melodramatic elements positively. Empire magazine hailed it as the \"most novel Bollywood movie of the year\". The BBC's Manish Gajjar described Hrithik Roshan's role as a \"mentally-retarded-child-[turned]-superman-hero\". Derek Elley praised him for avoiding his typecasting as a romantic hero, while David Parkinson of Radio Times thought that the film served as \"slick, sentimental entertainment\".

The reviewer's initial impression was that the film was \"cobbled together using two VHS machines, a stopwatch, and the complete literary works of Bill Warren\", and that the story was not what mattered in that the script \"is basically what you would get if you threw every monster movie plot filmed between 1955 and 1965 into a blender, then scooped out 90 minutes' worth and baked at gas mark seven.\" The reviewer praised the film's manner of not taking itself too seriously, as such was the \"central conceit of Newsom's hugely entertaining film\". The reviewer then listed the number of '50s-and '60s-genre icons that returned to reprise their characters from other films, and noted it as Kenneth Tobey's last film, and that actors John Agar, Les Tremayne, Robert Cornthwaite, George Fenneman, Robert Shayne, and Gloria Talbott died before the film was completed, and that Paul Marco died within a year of the film's release, and remarked that the film \"stands as a warm tribute to each and every one of them\"."]}, {"page": "Mike Simpson (journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT M.

The film was very well received and appeared at the 2009 Festival of Fantastic Films in Manchester. The Festivals chairman, Gil Layne Young wrote \"The direction was exciting, showing touches of quality that would be missed by much older directors. Kirk is a fantasy movie with roots in real Scottish life of the 17th century and for the first time in years I saw a bunch of real men wiping a tear from their eyes.\"Festival of Fantastic Films: Chairman's Review of Kirk Critic M. J. Simpson praised the director writing \"Despite the director's youth, this is one of the most accomplished, mature, professional and impressive films I have seen for a very long time. I think it no exaggeration to say that, if Ferns lives up to the promise of this debut feature, then Kirk marks the arrival on the scene of a major new talent.\"M.J Simpson Film Reviews & Interviews: Kirk In 2010, Ferns was awarded the 'Best Director' accolade at the 2010 British Academy Scotland New Talent Awards which was held at the Mitchell Theatre in Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Dreamscape (2007 film)", "response": ["Pre-production began in 2005 and the film was shot on locations in Birkenhead, Wallasey, Liverpool, Chester, Ellesmere Port, Neston and Wrexham. The film won 'Feature Film Award' at the 2008 Wirral International Film Festival held in Birkenhead. Film and television journalist M. J. Simpson, former deputy editor of SFX, reviewed the film in 2007, and observed that the film needed to be longer if it were to be considered for commercial distribution. Based upon Simpson's recommendation, the film was reworked from its original 63\u00a0minute length to 86\u00a0minutes. Once the extended cut of the film was completed, Simpson in 2009 reviewed the film's new version and stated that was the first time he had ever done this.", "M. J. Simpson reviewed the film upon its 2007 original release and wrote that the film was \"amazing\" as a \"testament to the way that digital technology can unlock the creative freedom of talented indie film-makers in ways that would have seemed unbelievable only ten years ago\", and that it \"combines terrific production design with seamless special effects and gorgeous black-and-white photography.\"  His critique of the film was that the script was \"slightly under-developed.\" In comparing it to the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall, he noted that TR worked because the viewer was never certain if the action was real or in Arnold's head, and that in Dreamscape the action works because the viewer never doubts that the events on screen in Dreamscape are imaginary. He concludes that it was \"a beautifully produced film. It doesn\u2019t just look good, it feels good, it\u2019s exciting and once the viewer abandons his preconceived notions and just goes with the post-Bond flow it\u2019s a damn fine piece of film-making.\"  Simpson also wrote that the director took his advice to extend the film.", "M. J. Simpson, noting that this was the first time he had ever done such, reviewed the extended version upon its release in 2009. He noted that the original 63\u00a0minute film was either too short or too long for most film festivals and too short for distributors, that the original had two acts and needed a third, and that he was pleased that the director actually took his advice as a film critic to create the extended version. He wrote that the \"newly added third act allows the character - and the audience - to explore the potential problems and dangers which he now faces\" and concluded that the new version of the film \"is all-round excellent,\" and that it stood \"a cut above the normal sort of indie features that one sees.\""]}, {"page": "Bordello Death Tales", "response": ["Aint It Cool News said the filmmakers \"deliver original and unique chills and thrills.\" M.
