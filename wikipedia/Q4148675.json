In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became a public company in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners (1846\u20131915). By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826\u20131894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was in the hands of William Posnette Manners, who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales.Christine Clark, 'Manners, Arthur (1879\u20131968)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 17 April 2012  The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879\u20131968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved to be more than a match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton"]}, {"page": "John Gretton, 2nd Baron Gretton", "response": ["Gretton was the son of John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, and Hon.
