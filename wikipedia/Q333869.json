Retrieved 7 July 2006. There are five regions: Mid and West Wales, North Wales, South Wales Central, South Wales East and South Wales West (these are the same as the pre 1999 European Parliament constituencies for Wales), each of which returns four members. The additional members produce a degree of proportionality within each region. Whereas voters can choose any regional party list irrespective of their party vote in the constituency election, list MSs are not elected independently of the constituency element; rather, elected constituency MSs are deemed to be pre-elected list representatives for the purposes of calculating remainders in the D'Hondt method. Overall proportionality is limited by the low proportion of list members (33% of the Senedd compared with 43% in the Scottish Parliament and 50% in the German Bundestag) and the regionalisation of the list element.Chapter 12: \"The Electoral Arrangements\" of the Report of the Richard Commission: Commission on the Powers and Electoral Arrangements of the National Assembly for Wales.

Consequently, the Senedd as a whole has a greater degree of proportionality (based on proportions in the list elections) than the plurality voting system used for British parliamentary elections, but still deviates somewhat from proportionality.

Tony Blair's favourable treatment of Michael was later described by Kellner as a \"determination to foist Alun Michael on the people of Wales\", which \"produced a spectacular collapse of support\".
