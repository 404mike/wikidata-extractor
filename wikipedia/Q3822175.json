At the time, riot was punishable by life imprisonment. The trials collapsed when the evidence given by the police was deemed \"unreliable\". Gareth Peirce, who acted as solicitor for some of the pickets, said that the charge of riot had been used \"to make a public example of people, as a device to assist in breaking the strike\", while Michael Mansfield called it \"the worst example of a mass frame-up in this country this century\". ", "The NUM deployed 5,000 pickets from across the UK, who planned to use sheer numbers (\"mass picketing\") to prevent access to Orgreave by strike-breaking lorries that collected coke for use at Scunthorpe. The South Yorkshire Police (SYP) were determined not to see a repeat of 1972's Battle of Saltley Gate \u2013 where 30,000 pickets had overwhelmed 800 police officers \u2013 and deployed around 6,000 officers from eighteen different forces at Orgreave, equipped with riot gear and supported by police dogs and 42 mounted police officers.In July 1990, during Arthur Critchlow and 38 Others v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Chief Inspector Geoffrey Drabble provided a list of all Police Support Units present at Orgreave on 18 June 1984.

Robert East et al, writing in the Journal of Law and Society in 1985, suggested that rather than maintaining order and upholding the law, \"the police intended that Orgreave would be a 'battle' where, as a result of their preparation and organisation, they would 'defeat' the pickets\". Michael Mansfield said: \"They wanted to teach the miners a lesson \u2013 a big lesson, such that they wouldn't come out in force again.\" Civil liberties pressure group Liberty has said: \"There was a riot.

Immediately after the Dando killing a number of telephone calls were made to the BBC and other media outlets claiming responsibility for the killing on behalf of Serb groups. These calls stated that the murder was revenge for the NATO bombing campaign in Serbia,  and threatened further killings. These calls were not judged wholly credible and may have been hoaxes. Nevertheless, at George's first trial, his defence barrister, Michael Mansfield, proposed that the Serbian warlord Arkan had ordered Dando's assassination in retaliation for the NATO bombing of the RTS headquarters. Mansfield suggested that Dando's earlier presentation of an appeal for aid for Kosovar Albanian refugees may have attracted the attention of Bosnian-Serb hardliners. Dando's appeal for aid for the Kosovar Albanian refugees had been shown on television three weeks before her murder."]}, {"page": "Birmingham Six", "response": ["Their second full appeal, in 1991, was allowed.
