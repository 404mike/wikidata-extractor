Over the next six years, he played 220 League matches, missing only two league matches over his first three seasons and, unusually for a goalkeeper, scored three goals, all from the penalty spot. He then spent the 1930\u201331 season with Lincoln City as their regular goalkeeper, playing alongside his younger brother Tom as Lincoln finished as runners-up in the Third Division North. He spent two seasons in the Second Division with Notts County before finishing his career back in the third tier with Accrington Stanley."]}]}}
