Shortly after, Mildred goes into hospital with suspected appendicitis so kindly Ann, to Jeffrey's annoyance, has George round for dinner. When he gets home he finds Jerry, who has been evicted, wanting to stay, along with his 'niece' (Sue Bond. But the appendicitis is actually indigestion, and Mildred comes home early. She is not happy to find two unwelcome guests and throws them out. Mildred becomes disenchanted by her failure to be included in the social life on her middle-class estate. She and George return to George's old neighbourhood, with an eye to moving back, and visit his old neighbours Alf and Gladys (Michael Robbins and Queenie Watts), but they find the terraced streets are gone, replaced by modern tower blocks, so the idea is abandoned. Mildred starts taking driving lessons from the elderly Mr. Bowles (Robert Raglan) from the Common, but wants to keep it secret from George, because every time he has tried to teach her, it ends in disaster, so she says she is going to the Keep Fit class. When Ann accidentally lets slip that the Keep Fit class has finished George suspects Mildred of having an affair and, taking advice from Jeffrey, attempts to be more romantic with her. A misunderstanding arises when the supposed lover comes to the Ropers' house but all is resolved as Mildred passes her test."]}, {"page": "George and Mildred (film)", "response": ["*Sue Bond as Marlene"]}, {"page": "Bond (surname)", "response": ["*Sue Bond (born 1945), British singer and actress"]}, {"page": "List of All Creatures Great and Small (1978\u20131990 TV series) characters", "response": ["*Lydia \u2014 Sue Bond"]}, {"page": "Clegg (film)", "response": ["* Sue Bond - Panties Girl"]}, {"page": "White Cargo (1973 film)", "response": ["*Sue Bond - Desiree"]}]}}
