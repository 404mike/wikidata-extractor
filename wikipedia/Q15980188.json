As a member of the Comet Line, she helped downed Allied airmen evade capture by German forces. After being betrayed in November 1942, she was sentenced to death and subjected to the 'Nacht und Nebel' policy designed to make such opponents of the Nazis 'disappear' in prison camps. She survived to tell her story to her family back in England and to receive awards for her work. Her teen age children, Elsie and Robert, also survived prison, but her husband Georges was executed.", "link_mentions": {}}}
