Officers, however, could re-imprison them again once they were healthy. This was an attempt to avoid force-feeding. In response, the WSPU organised an all-women security team known as the Bodyguard, trained in ju-jitsu by Edith Margaret Garrud and led by Gertrude Harding, whose role was to protect fugitive suffragettes from re-imprisonment.Rouse, Wendy Her Own Hero: The Origins of the Women's Self-Defense Movement.

Believing that the British War Office would reject their offer of help, and knowing that the French were in need of medical assistance, they offered their assistance to the French Red Cross. The French accepted their offer and provided them the space of a newly built hotel in Paris as their hospital. Murray was appointed M\u00e9decin-en-Chef (chief physician) and Anderson became the chief surgeon.", "At Endell, Anderson and the hospital pathologist, Helen Chambers, pioneered a new method of treating septic wounds, an antiseptic ointment called BIPP (bismuth, iodoform, and paraffin paste). The paste had been invented by James Rutherford Morison. After positive results from some initial tests by Anderson, Morison asked her and Chambers to run a larger trial of BIPP in 1916. Anderson published case studies in The Lancet, concluding that this method saved patients pain and was better than the Carrel-Dakin method, which used a more powerful antiseptic but had to be frequently reapplied to be effective. Since bandages could be left on for longer, the BIPP method reduced time spent changing bandages by as much as 80%. BIPP was widely adopted by surgeons for the rest of the war, although opinion among doctors remained divided as to the best method for wound treatment. Despite continued debate, BIPP was also used in the Second World War and continues to be in use today in ear, nose, throat, maxillofacial, and neurosurgery procedures.thumb|Flora Murray (left) and Louise Garrett Anderson (right) leaving Buckingham Palace after receiving decorations", "Flora Murray "]}, {"page": "Olive Wharry", "response": ["The pages in her scrapbook, held by the British Library in London, also record her weight loss on release from prison, and contains newspaper cuttings of a policeman carrying her bags on her release from prison and a burnt down tea pavilion at Kew Gardens.Photograph of pages from Wharry's scrapbook \u2013 British Library website Wharry was released into the care of Dr. Flora Murray on 10 August 1914 under the Government's amnesty of suffrage prisoners."]}, {"page": "Flora (given name)", "response": ["*Flora Murray (1869\u20131923), British doctor and suffragette"]}, {"page": "Patricia Fara", "response": ["Her areas of particular academic interest include the role of portraiture and art in the history of science, science in the 18th century England during the Enlightenment and the role of women in science.
