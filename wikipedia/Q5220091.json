Stevenage opened the scoring in the second-half through midfielder Andy Drury, but were pegged back ten minutes later following good work from ex-Borough winger Dale Binns, who set-up Danny Allen-Page to finish from close range. Stevenage then drew their third game within the space of a week, playing out a 0\u20130 stalemate with Barrow at Holker Street. Three days later, Borough recorded their first win of the 2009\u201310 season, with a 3\u20130 victory over Ebbsfleet United at Broadhall Way. Chris Beardsley scored on his debut after just 10 minutes, with Joel Byrom and Lawrie Wilson adding to Stevenage's tally courtesy of two second-half goals. Stevenage lost their first game of the season on 22 August, losing 2\u20131 against Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium, with Yemi Odubade scoring his first goal for Borough deep into injury-time. A week later, Stevenage beat Rushden & Diamonds 2\u20131, with goals from Lee Boylan and Michael Bostwick after Cliff Akurang had equalised for the away side. The visitors played the majority of the game with 10-men, having had Michael Corcoran sent-off for a tackle on Lawrie Wilson, which resulted in the latter suffering a dislocated ankle and broken leg in three places. The Hertfordshire side then gained their first away win of the season two days later, with a 2\u20130 victory against Histon despite playing the majority of the game with ten men after Peter Vincenti was sent-off in the sixth minute for violent conduct. However, goals from both Scott Laird and Eddie Odhiambo secured the three points. Daniel Wright also missed a penalty for the home side late on. This was followed up with a third successive victory against Eastbourne Borough at Broadhall Way eight days later. Jon Ashton scored his first goal in Stevenage colours, heading in from Joel Byrom's corner. Ronnie Henry then doubled the home side's lead in the second-half following good work from Mitchell Cole."]}, {"page": "Brentford F.C.
