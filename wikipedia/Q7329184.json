Her late husband used to work on the railway, as she frequently reminds the other members of staff; her catchphrase is \"he was an engine driver you know\". She very often muddles her words and seems to be fond of Harry (who always ignores her advances) and Gloria (Lindsay Grimshaw), Jack and May's pretty teenage daughter, who loves wearing short skirts, much to the chagrin of her father. She shows an interest in men, but Jack is over-protective and will not let any man take her out. Several other members of railway staff appear, including an older engine driver Arnold Thomas (Ivor Roberts); his inexperienced fireman Ralph (Perry Benson), who is training to be a driver; and the flirtatious guard, Percy (Terry John), with whom Ethel appears to be quite besotted at times. He returns her advances, but seems to prefer Gloria's friend, Amy Matlock (Tara Daniels), who appears in most episodes, albeit usually briefly. Richard Spendlove, one of the writers and the co-creator, also appeared in several episodes as Mr Orkindale, the district inspector.", "Mr Orkindale (Richard Spendlove) District Inspector \u2013 Senior to Parkin, calls staff by Christian names and fancies May.
