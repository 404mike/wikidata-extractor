After holding posts at the University of Oxford, University of Exeter, University of Ghana and Harvard University, in 1973 he became the inaugural Professor of Peace Studies at the University of Bradford, following the establishment of the University's Department of Peace Studies. Curle's works included several books on education, including Educational Strategy for Developing Societies (1963), and a number of books on peace and peacemaking, including Making Peace (1971).

As he had done with weather, he analysed war using mainly differential equations and probability theory. Considering the armament of two nations, Richardson posited an idealised system of equations whereby the rate of a nation's armament build-up is directly proportional to the amount of arms its rival has and also to the grievances felt toward the rival, and negatively proportional to the amount of arms it already has itself. Solution of this system of equations allows insightful conclusions to be made regarding the nature, and the stability or instability, of various hypothetical conditions which might obtain between nations."]}, {"page": "William Wordsworth Fisher", "response": ["Fisher was the brother of Herbert Fisher, Edmund Fisher, Charles Fisher, Florence Henrietta Darwin and Adeline Vaughan Williams.

Cordelia was also close to Conrad, especially in the earlier years of her marriage. Their son Adam Curle was born in 1916. Richard was not a frequent presence in Adam's childhood; Adam did meet his father until he was three years old. Adam Curle would later become Director of Harvard University's Centre for Studies in Education and Development, and the United Kingdom's first Professor of Peace Studies in the University of Bradford's Department of Peace Studies.", "Tom Woodhouse described Curle as a \"larger-than-life\" figure with a reputation as a womaniser. Adam Curle remembered his father as a compulsive traveller, \"certainly not made for family life,\" and suffering from occasional fits of melancholy, guilt and bad temper, but also loyal, courteous and possessed of a \"ribald sense of the ludicrous\". He attributed his father's closeness to Conrad to their shared \"sense of the inwardness of things, of mystery, of the strange hidden behind the banal\". He described him as closer to \"a delightful uncle who would periodically descend and whisk me off\" than a father in his early life, but noted that they became closer in his adulthood. Nonetheless, in Adam Curle's account his father's relationship with him was less important to him than his friendships with Wedgwood and especially with Conrad."]}, {"page": "Franz Baermann Steiner", "response": ["He obtained his doctorate in linguistics 1935 with a thesis on Arabic word formation (Studien zur arabischen Wurzelgeschichte, \"Studies on the History of Arabic Roots\").

During his exile in England he became an intimate of Elias Canetti, to whom he had previously been introduced, in Vienna, by Hans Adler. During the war he studied under Evans-Pritchard, while in turn deeply influencing him and many lecturers and students of that circle, including Meyer Fortes, Mary Douglas, Louis Dumont, Adam Curle, M.
