Current club professional is former Leicestershire player Tom New.", "The winter months of 2011 were a busy time for the Mills management with much comings and goings to the side from the previous campaign. The marquee signing was Tom New rejoining the club following his release from Leicestershire and he would join the side as Batsmen wicket keeper, Adam Dobb was also to rejoin the club following his release from the Notts Academy and would form a key spin trio with Matt New and Sudesh Fernando. Unfortunately the team said goodbye to Paul Burdett and Steve Ludlam two guys who had fitted in extremely well to the club and been key parts of the cup success enjoyed by the Mills over the previous campaigns, Mark Smallwood also said goodbye deciding that opportunities would be easier to come by at Worksop and made the move to the Bassetlaw side. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the departure of Kieran Garside to Cuckney, the fast bowler had really found his form towards the end of the campaign and his loss was a real blow to the Mills ambitions. Jonathan Salmon and Billy North were promoted to the first team squad to cover the gap left by Garside later filled by Ashley Holland who was to join the club during the campaign. The season began with a trip to Cuckney with the game being played on a wicket clearly affected by the weather but the willingness of both sides ensured a match was played with Cuckney bowling a depleted Mills line up out for under 50 to give the season an early knock back. The team bounced back winning away at Wollaton with Tom New and Sudesh Fernando both scoring half century's and 6 wickets for Matt New put the mills back on track. An exciting National cup tie at home to Whitley Hall followed with Craig Gould in outstanding form striking 174* not out in the Mills 271 however Whitley Hall batted with incredible intent and knocked the Mills score off with 5 overs to spare, a remarkable run chase but the Mills should have scored more runs on what was a very good wicket."]}, {"page": "List of Leicestershire Cricket Board List A players", "response": ["*Tom New, 2 matches, 2001\u20132002"]}, {"page": "List of Leicestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Tom New (2003\u20132011) : T.
