He is now an Emeritus Professor at Aberystwyth University, having previously taught at the University of the West of England and the University of Sussex. Over the course of his career he has written or co-edited fifteen books. He is known for being one of the pioneers behind the concept of cultural racism, which he termed \"new racism\".\nBarker received an undergraduate degree in philosophy from the University of Liverpool in 1967, after which he lectured in cultural studies at Bristol Polytechnic, later renamed the University of the West of England, from 1969 to 1998. Identifying as a committed socialist and anti-racist, during the 1970s, Barker focused his research on racism, in particular its place in British children's comics. Studying growing hostility to migrants in Britain, he coined the idea of \"new racism\"\u2014later known as cultural racism\u2014and promoted this through his 1981 book The New Racism. His argument was that the concept of \"racism\", created in the 1930s to describe biological racism, should be extended to take into account prejudices against people on the basis of cultural difference. In 1995 he gained a DPhil from that university.\nHe then worked as reader in media studies at the University of Sussex from 1998 to 2001, before becoming professor of film and television studies at the University of the West of England, where he remained until 2011, when he became professor emeritus. Much of his work in the 1990s and 2000s focused on media audiences, looking in particular at the audiences for fantasy fiction like The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and Game of Thrones.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cultural racism", "response": ["The concept of cultural racism was developed in the 1980s and 1990s by West European scholars such as Martin Barker, \u00c9tienne Balibar, and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff. These theorists argued that the hostility to immigrants then evident in Western countries should be labelled racism, a term that had been used to describe discrimination on the grounds of perceived biological race since the early 20th century. They argued that while biological racism had become increasingly unpopular in Western societies during the second half of the 20th century, it had been replaced by a new, cultural racism that relied on a belief in intrinsic and insurmountable cultural differences instead. They noted that this change was being promoted by far-right movements such as the French Nouvelle Droite.", "The concept of \"cultural racism\" has been given various names, particularly as it was being developed by academic theorists in the 1980s and early 1990s. The British scholar of media studies and cultural studies Martin Barker termed it the \"new racism\", whereas the French philosopher \u00c9tienne Balibar favoured \"neo-racism\", and later \"cultural-differential racism\". Another French philosopher, Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff, used the term \"differentialist racism\", while a similar term used in the literature has been \"the racism of cultural difference\". The Spanish sociologist Ram\u00f3n Flecha instead used the term \"postmodern racism\"."]}, {"page": "Acme Press", "response": ["* Comic Profiles 1. 10 Years of 2000 AD \u2014 a Video Celebration \u2014 featuring Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, Kevin O'Neill, Alan Grant, Mike McMahon, Pat Mills, John Sanders, Martin Barker, Cam Kennedy, Mike Baron, and Richard Burton"]}, {"page": "Barker, Martin", "response": ["#redirectMartin Barker"]}]}}
