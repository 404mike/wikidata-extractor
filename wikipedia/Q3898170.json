The sixth consciousness, mano-vij\u00f1\u0101na, was seen as the surveyor of the content of the five senses as well as of mental content like thoughts and ideas. The seventh consciousness developed from the early Buddhist concept of manas, and was seen as the defiled mentation (kli\u1e63\u1e6da-manas) which is obsessed with notions of \"self\". According to Paul Williams, this consciousness \"takes the substratum consciousness as its object and mistakenly considers the substratum consciousness to be a true Self.\"", "Yog\u0101c\u0101ra works often define three basic modes or \"natures\" (svabh\u0101va) of experience. Jonathan Gold explains that \"the three natures are all one reality viewed from three distinct angles. They are the appearance, the process, and the emptiness of that same apparent entity.\" According to Paul Williams, \"all things which can be known can be subsumed under these Three Natures.\" Since this schema is Yog\u0101c\u0101ra's systematic explanation of the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), each of the three natures are also explained as having a lack of own-nature (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vat\u0101).\"Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. 176.

Because of being dependent on conditions. Because of being only fabrication. The eternal non-existence of the appearance as it is appears: That is known to be the perfected nature, because of being always the same. What appears there? The unreal fabrication. How does it appear? As a dual self. What is its nonexistence?

According to Williams, the Abhidharma description of praj\u00f1\u0101 stops at the discernment of dharmas as the final reality, but Mahayana and some non-Mahayana schools go on to teach that all dharmas are empty (dharma-\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). Buddhist scholar John Makransky describes dharmas in this sense to mean \"phenomena\". Williams goes on to say that the meaning of praj\u00f1\u0101 according to Mahayana Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras is ultimately the state of understanding emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101).  Religious studies scholar Dale S. Wright points to the Heart Sutra which states that those who want \"to practice the profound perfection of wisdom (praj\u00f1\u0101) should view things in this way [as empty]\". Wright states this view is not wisdom, but having the view will make you wise.

According to Buddhist studies scholar Paul Williams,", "According to James Taylor, a scholar of Religious Studies and Anthropology, Dhammakaya's doctrinal views on nirvana and \"enduring notions of self\" are similar to the Personalist School of early Buddhism. The Dhammakaya doctrines may be better seen as an example of \"hybridized Buddhism\" similar to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist association Fo Guang Shan in Taiwan, states Taylor. Paul Williams states that in some respects the teachings of the Dhammakaya tradition resemble the Buddha-nature and Trikaya doctrines of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism.
