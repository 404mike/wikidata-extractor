On short circuits, his first championship success came when he won the 250cc British Championship in 1990. Superbike victory followed with the British Superbike Championship in 1995. Some attributed his success to James Whitham leaving the series mid-season to deal with cancer [Whitham was behind in the championship prior to his illness]. Although he did not take a BSB victory in 1996 or 1997, Hislop was hired by Rob McElnea's dominant Cadbury's Boost Yamaha team for 1998 [to the surprise of commentators and journalists, most notably BBC pundit Barry Nutley]. The nature of the fight for the championship between Hislop & team mate Mackenzie was illustrated by a near-collision on the last lap at Snetterton which cost the team a 1\u20132 finish. Hislop generally matched his countryman before an injurious crash took him out of title contention."]}, {"page": "Kyalami", "response": ["| World SSP || 1:46.975 || James Whitham || Yamaha YZF-R6 || 2002 Kyalami Supersport World Championship round"]}, {"page": "North West 200", "response": ["!
