In September 2018, he used several expletives while condemning the use of female pundits, thought to be in response to Alex Scott's appearance on Sky Sports during an England men's game against Switzerland, saying men and women were \"nowhere near equal\" and that female players \"can't kick a ball\". In June 2019, he came to public attention again for repeatedly making sexist tweets during the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. It provoked a response from West Ham midfielder Kate Longhurst whom he asked \"how many headers can you do?\" In response he then demanded a preseason friendly with a team made up of some his Twitter followers called Men United. Knight received no response from West Ham."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 FA Women's Premier League", "response": ["|4=||Kate Longhurst||Millwall||8"]}, {"page": "2012 FA Women's Cup Final", "response": ["Helen Lander put Chelsea ahead in the 70th minute courtesy of a neat turn and finish and it looked for a long time that this solitary goal would be enough for glory, but Rachel Williams equalised in the 91st minute after Chelsea failed to clear a Karen Carney corner.

This goal forced the penalty shoot-out which they would eventually triumph in.
