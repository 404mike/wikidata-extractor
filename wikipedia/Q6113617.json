Attlee, now leader of the PLP, asked him to join a new defence committee, working with Shinwell and Jack Lawson to reverse the pacifist ideals which had prevailed under Lansbury. Alexander had been warning of the dangers posed by fascism for several years, and criticised the government's policy of appeasement. In 1937, with Hugh Dalton and Hastings Bertram Lees-Smith, he persuaded the PLP to put aside its mistrust of the Baldwin government and support the Service Estimates Bill which began rearmament. In October 1938, he closed the debate on the Munich Pact, attacking the government's abandonment of the Sudeten Germans."]}, {"page": "Baron Lawson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Lawson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jack Lawson"]}, {"page": "First MacDonald ministry", "response": ["| Jack Lawson"]}, {"page": "Second MacDonald ministry", "response": ["| Jack Lawson"]}, {"page": "The Boldons", "response": ["In the earlier part of the 20th century, a famous son of the community was the Labour politician Jack Lawson.
