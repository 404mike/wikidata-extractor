The firm also arranged many high-profile funerals including actor Donald Pleasence and television personality Jade Goody.Albin-Dyer was born Barry George Dyer in London. His father was an undertaker. He took over the firm Albin and Sons in 1986, and subsequently changed his own surname to Albin-Dyer. He resisted lucrative offers from  large funeral companies who wanted to buy F.A.Albin and Sons, preferring to remain independent. He was a well-known figure in the Bermondsey area of London, where the firm were based, and in connection with his military work at Royal Wootton Bassett and Brize Norton.In mid-2003, F.A. Albin and Sons and its staff alongside Albin-Dyer, were featured in an ITV television series titled Don't Drop the Coffin, which followed the daily working lives of its staff from late 2002 to early 2003. It was also one of the most talked-about programmes of the year. The title is inspired, by the first piece of advice Albin-Dyer's father gave him when he started out in the undertaker's business. The series was inspired by a book of the same name Albin-Dyer previously released, with ITV later repackaging the book with additional material on the making of the series.\nAlbin-Dyer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.He died from brain cancer on 6 June 2015, aged 64. He was a Roman Catholic convert. In tribute, Digital television channel London Live repeated Don't Drop the Coffin in full, having already repeated the series in January of that year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fisher Athletic F.C.", "response": ["Following a meeting in Bermondsey on the evening of 28 May, a supporters trust was formed to take control of all forthcoming club matters, with 42 founding members.
