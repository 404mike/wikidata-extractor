The two day, first-class match, against Cambridge University at Fenners, was drawn in unusual circumstances. Cambridge were bowled out by Blackburn and Smith for 170, with Yorkshire scoring 383 in reply, including Wright's 12 runs batting at number six. Cambridge rallied to post 300, setting Yorkshire 87 to win. Wilfred Rhodes and Percy Holmes could only muster 80 runs in the twenty eight overs bowled, before the game was drawn.\nHe later became an audiologist. Wright died in Aberystwyth, Wales, in November 1962, aged 62.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Wright", "response": ["Thomas Wright may refer to:", "* Thomas Wright (writer) (fl. 1604), English writer", "* Thomas Wright (engraver) (1792\u20131849), British engraver and portrait painter", "* Thomas Wright (antiquarian) (1810\u20131877), British antiquarian and writer", "* Thomas Wright (social commentator) (1839\u20131909), English social commentator", "* Thomas Wright (Lord Mayor) (died 1798), Lord Mayor of London in 1785", "* Thomas Wright (astronomer) (1711\u20131786), English astronomer and mathematician", "* Thomas Wright (geologist) (1809\u20131884), Scottish surgeon and paleontologist", "* Thomas Wright (cricketer, born 1842) (1842\u2013?), English cricketer", "* Thomas Wright (cricketer, born 1900) (1900\u20131962), English cricketer", "* Thomas Wright (rugby) (1924\u20131990), Scottish rugby union and rugby league player", "* Thomas Wright (controversialist) (died 1624), English Roman Catholic priest and controversialist", "* Thomas Wright (philanthropist) (1789\u20131875), British prison philanthropist"]}]}}
