The two day, first-class match, against Cambridge University at Fenners, was drawn in unusual circumstances. Cambridge were bowled out by Blackburn and Smith for 170, with Yorkshire scoring 383 in reply, including Wright's 12 runs batting at number six. Cambridge rallied to post 300, setting Yorkshire 87 to win. Wilfred Rhodes and Percy Holmes could only muster 80 runs in the twenty eight overs bowled, before the game was drawn.\nHe later became an audiologist. Wright died in Aberystwyth, Wales, in November 1962, aged 62.", "link_mentions": {}}}
