The countess was for many years a popular figure in London society, known for her blonde beauty, bright personality, graceful dancing and the diligence with which she helped organise lavish entertainments patronised by English royalty and members of the nobility. She was long involved in charity work throughout the U.K., most notably assisting the Red Cross with fundraising and as a nurse for the Coulter Hospital in London during World War I. Lady Rothes was also a leading benefactor of the Queen Victoria School and The Chelsea Hospital for Women, known today as Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "No\u00ebl Leslie, Countess of Rothes", "response": ["No\u00ebl Rothes is best known as a heroine of the 1912 Titanic tragedy, helping to command her lifeboat, in concert with Able Seaman Thomas William (Tom) Jones.
