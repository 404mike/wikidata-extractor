Smith blamed the band for allowing the theft to happen. Fed up with his treatment, Steve and Paul Hanley immediately left the band. This left The Fall with a single drummer and no bassist. Both Hanleys were persuaded to return for a televised performance on The Old Grey Whistle Test, where The Fall played \"Lay of the Land\" accompanied by the Michael Clark Dance Company. Eventually, Brix talked Mark into making peace with Steve Hanley, whom she considered as the anchor and the most reliable person in the band; his departure was then changed to a temporary leave, as he was under the additional stress of having to look after his ill premature-born son. In the meantime, the bass player's position was taken by Simon Rogers, a classically-trained musician whom Mark E. Smith met through mutual acquaintance Michael Clark.

To coax musicians into performing as he prefers, Smith was notorious for using a variety of \"moulding\" methods such as insults, silent treatment, and jostling musicians onstage. Many of Burns's former Fall bandmates reported that he was most likely to retaliate against Smith, physically if Burns deemed it necessary. Burns's clashes with Smith was perhaps most obvious at the notorious New York City concert in 1998 where Burns attacked Smith after the vocalist repeatedly and deliberately knocked one of Burns's cymbal stands to the floor.
