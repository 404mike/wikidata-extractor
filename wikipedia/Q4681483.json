He then continued to regain his first team for the side at the start of the season, playing in the midfield position. In the absence of Oshilaja, Trotter captained the side for the first time, starting the whole game, as AFC Wimbledon lost 2\u20131 against Walsall on 21 August 2018. It wasn't until on 15 September 2018 when he scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20132 loss against Scunthorpe United, which was followed up by setting up the club's only goal in the game, in a 2\u20131 loss against Accrington Stanley. Trotter was at fault when he missed a penalty, which would have saw AFC Wimbledon equalised, as the side lost 1\u20130 against Peterborough United on 30 November 2018. However, by December, Trotter soon found his first team opportunities limited under the management of Wally Downes, Ardley's successor. By the time he departed Wimbledon in February, Trotter went on to make twenty\u2013five appearances and scoring once in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Cardiff City F.C.

Ardley recommended Ralls, Deji Oshilaja and Mamadou Diallo to Mackay and Ralls and Oshilaja were eventually named on the substitutes bench for the match. Mackay later revealed that he knew very little about Ralls prior to his inclusion in the match. Ralls was brought on after 67 minutes in place of Andrew Taylor to make his professional debut at the age of 17 as Cardiff went on to win 3\u20131 in extra-time.

York went behind away to AFC Wimbledon when Deji Oshilaja scored a header in the 19th minute, before Hyde scored an equaliser after goalkeeper Joe McDonnell dropped Sinclair's cross in the 43rd minute.

York drew 0\u20130 at home to relegation rivals Carlisle, and the team's best chances came in the 74th minute when Coulson and Sinclair had shots cleared off the line.
