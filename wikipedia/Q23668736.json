This was the earliest exit at this tournament for Federer who was seeking his 70th match win in Halle, and his 18th quarterfinal at this event in as many appearances. At Wimbledon, 39-year-old Federer advanced to the quarterfinals and thus became the oldest Wimbledon quarterfinalist in the Open Era, breaking the record held by Ken Rosewall, following wins over Adrian Mannarino by retirement, Richard Gasquet, 29th seed Cameron Norrie, and 23rd seed Lorenzo Sonego. However, he was then upset by 14th seed Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinal in straight sets. This was the first time in 19 years at Wimbledon he lost in straight sets, and only the second time he lost a set 6\u20130 in the 21st century (the previous occasion was against Nadal in the 2008 French Open final)."]}, {"page": "Texas Christian University", "response": ["* Cameron Norrie - British Tennis Player"]}, {"page": "Queen's Club Championships", "response": ["|2021 ||  Matteo Berrettini ||  Cameron Norrie || 6\u20134, 6\u20137(5\u20137), 6\u20133"]}, {"page": "ATP Awards", "response": ["| rowspan=\"4\" | 2021 || rowspan=\"4\" |  Facundo Lugones || rowspan=\"4\" |  Cameron Norrie ||  Craig Boynton ||  Hubert Hurkacz "]}, {"page": "Babolat", "response": ["*  Cameron Norrie"]}]}}
