Prof. McMinn developed the first successful modern metal-on-metal hip resurfacing and the instrumentation and surgical technique to implant it. Hip resurfacing is a bone-conserving, less invasive alternative to total hip replacement (THR) for young patients, markedly improves the health-related quality of life measures and currently makes up around a tenth of all hip arthroplasty (artificial joint) procedures performed in the United Kingdom. McMinn is also the inventor of several other prostheses for the hip and knee.Derek McMinn is the author of Modern Hip Resurfacing (ISBN 978-1848000872), published in 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andy Murray", "response": ["Bob Bryan urged Murray to have the \"Birmingham hip (BHR)\" operation he underwent in August 2018, involving a cobalt-chrome metal cap being placed over the femur with a matching metal cup in the acetabulum (a conservative bone-saving alternative to a traditional Total Hip Replacement). Bryan informed Murray that the BHR would improve his quality of life and may help him return to the professional tennis tour. On 29 January, Murray announced on Instagram that he had undergone hip resurfacing surgery in London and hoped that it would \"be the end of my hip pain.\" On 4 February, in an interview with The Times, Professor Derek McMinn, who invented the BHR implant and procedure, gave the opinion that Murray's chances of returning to competitive tennis should be \"in the high 90 per cent\". On 7 March, Murray stated in an interview that he was now free of pain in his hip as a result of the surgery and may therefore return to playing competitive tennis, but that any potential Wimbledon return would be dependent on how his hip felt, and that he would not rush his comeback and may test his condition by playing doubles."]}, {"page": "Science and invention in Birmingham", "response": ["1991: Derek McMinn begins the first successful modern metal-on-metal hip resurfacing operations and the instrumentation and surgical technique to implant it."]}, {"page": "Hip resurfacing", "response": ["In 2006, the United States FDA approved hip resurfacing using the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, designed by British Orthopaedic surgeon Derek McMinn.

There are several other manufacturers of hip resurfacing systems, mainly in Europe."]}]}}
