His father was also called James Brown, and was one of the proprietors of the Blaina iron-works, Monmouthshire for a time.\nJames attended Camberwell Collegiate School and King's College London, before joining his uncle, Thomas Brown, managing director of Ebbw Vale iron-works at Ebbw Vale to train as an Iron-master. He was more interested in music however, and performed as a pianist, violinist, and also as an organist in a number of places of worship.\nAfter deciding to leave his business career for a career in music, he was appointed, in 1869, organist of Aldershot parish church. In 1875 he took up a position as organist of Hale church, near Farnham, and in 1879, of the parish church of Farnham.\nHis published works include a sonata in E major for violin and pianoforte; this work was awarded the Sir Michael Costa prize by the Trinity College of Music, London. He died in April 1908.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Brown (disambiguation)", "response": ["* James Conway Brown, Welsh musician"]}, {"page": "1838 in Wales", "response": ["*27 December - James Conway Brown, musician (d. 1908)"]}, {"page": "Camberwell Collegiate School", "response": ["*James Conway Brown, musician (1838\u20131908)"]}, {"page": "St Andrew's Church, Farnham", "response": ["James Conway Brown took up the position of organist of the church in 1879."]}]}}
