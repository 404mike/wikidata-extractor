He previously held a Queen\u2019s Research Chair position and appointments in the Department of Sociology and the Faculty of Law at Queen's University.\nBorn in Edinburgh, Scotland, Lyon received Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in social science and history at the University of Bradford in Yorkshire, England, fuelling a fascination with driving forces behind and social consequences of some major transformations of the modern world.\nBest known internationally for his work in surveillance studies, Lyon defines surveillance as the \"operations and experiences of gathering and analyzing personal data for influence, entitlement or management.\" As well, he has developed key concepts in the field, such as \"social sorting\". Lyon has also taught and researched in the areas of information society, globalization, secularization, and postmodernity. He is author, co-author, editor or co-editor of 28 books. His books have been translated into 16 languages.\nHe was a founding editor of the journal Surveillance & Society, is an associate editor of The Information Society, and is on the international editorial board of a number of other academic journals. Since 2000 Lyon has led a series of team projects; currently, \"Big Data Surveillance\" (2015\u20132020). He is also on the international advisory boards of other major projects in surveillance studies.\nHe has held visiting appointments in a number of universities including Auckland, Bir Zeit, Edinburgh, Leeds, Melbourne, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, the Centre for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore, and the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris. Lyon has also encouraged surveillance research initiatives and groups around the world, especially in Israel/Palestine and the Middle East, Japan, and Latin America.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Panopticon", "response": ["In 1984 Michael Radford gained international attention for the cinematographic panopticon he had staged in the film Nineteen Eighty-Four. Of the telescreens in the landmark surveillance narrative Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), George Orwell said: \"there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment\u00a0... you had to live\u00a0... in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised\". In Radford's film the telescreens were bidirectional and in a world with an ever increasing number of telescreen devices the citizens of Oceania were spied on more than they thought possible. In The Electronic Eye: The Rise of Surveillance Society (1994) the sociologist David Lyon concluded that \"no single metaphor or model is adequate to the task of summing up what is central to contemporary surveillance, but important clues are available in Nineteen Eighty-Four and in Bentham's panopticon\".", "The concept of panopticon has been referenced in early discussions about the impact of social media. The notion of dataveillance was coined by Roger Clarke in 1987, since then academic researchers have used expressions such as superpanopticon (Mark Poster 1990), panoptic sort (Oscar H. Gandy Jr. 1993) and electronic panopticon (David Lyon 1994) to describe social media. Because the controlled is at the center and surrounded by those who watch, early surveillance studies treat social media as a reverse panopticon."]}, {"page": "Biometrics", "response": ["An early cataloguing of fingerprints dates back to 1885 when Juan Vucetich started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina.The History of Fingerprints .

In addition to contributing to the advent of citizen journalism, the proliferation of sousveillance technologies has suggested a number of legal/regulatory, ethical, and social implications for democratic and consumer rights. A dramatic illustration of these concerns comes from University of Toronto Professor Steve Mann, a privacy rights advocate and pioneering engineer of such technologies. After being allegedly assaulted in a French McDonald's restaurant for wearing an augmented-reality digital eye glass device, Mann was, ironically, allegedly denied access to McDonald's own surveillance camera footage. This led to Mann's coinage of the term \"McVeillance\" for instances of surveillance/sousveillance double standards and to his contribution the proposal of the Mann-Wassell law in the New York legislature."]}, {"page": "Social sorting", "response": ["The concept is accredited to David Lyon, a sociologist who is best known for his work in surveillance studies. Contemporary times have allowed for the influx and constant growth of data collection especially in the countries of the global north. A prime example of social terming is surveillance. This practice was not always as sophisticated as today. Historically, simple tools such as labor-intensive watchers, book keeping and record keeping acted as the enablers of this form. Surveillance is now done by governments and various organizations. This technological tools that are equipped with surveillance are cameras, records of transactions done at banking machines and point of sale terminals, machine readable passports before boarding, cellular phone calls along with many other examples. This collection of raw data then enables trends to be found and the fostering of predictions.", "There are paranoias and indifferences in regards to social sorting. The September 11 attacks and the subsequent war on terror have fueled the desire for categorizing and profiling people. The beneficiaries that are associated with it are evident as it allows for a more transparent viewership. Some researchers such as David Lyon are concerned with the rise of big data as there are many implication on the daily lives of many.", "According to David Lyon, Canadians are still unaware of the fact that surveillance which goes collaboratively with social sorting is now very much integrated into their daily lives. David Lyon discusses that the systematic routines and attention to personal detail which is encompassed into surveillance. The key criticism involves indifferent treatment to individuals based on their profile. Depending on the details of a person it can lead to the determination of whether the person may end up on a No Fly List.", "David Lyon insinuates that social sorting through surveillance is a modern threat to freedom. Byproducts of social sorting are isolation, segregation and marginalization. Social sorting has called into account issues that primarily involve equity and fairness. Different societies sort in different ways."]}, {"page": "Surveillance & Society", "response": ["Surveillance & Society is an open-access, peer-reviewed academic journal covering research on surveillance.
