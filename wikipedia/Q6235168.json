He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School (1905\u201311) and then Downing College, Cambridge, where he played for Cambridge University RFC. He had seven caps for Scotland in 1912\u201314, and he was dubbed the \"Flying Scot\" for his playing style. Will had played in the last match before the war, the Calcutta Cup match at Inverleith against England, alongside James Huggan who died in 1914, and Frederick Harding Turner and Eric Templeton Young, who died in 1915.Will joined the Honourable Artillery Company when the war began in August 1914 and was sent to France the following month. The following April he was commissioned into the Worcestershire Hussars and then switched to the Leinster Regiment the next month. In August 1915, he was wounded in action near Hooge, Belgium.
