The English were proclaimed, \"the Greatest Exponents of Football.\" and player Ted Collins, \"the Fastest Man on a Football Field. He owns Greyhounds and trains with them. Terry Huddle, goalkeeper, 6ft 3in of muscle, can throw the ball as far as the average kick. Every player a star attraction,\" in an advertisement before the game against Wellington. Arthur Stollery, the future Notts County F.C. manager would be the trainer for the English Amateurs. The Taranaki region would not see a visit from the international English team though a few players were invited to join a Wanganui/Taranaki team that played the English XI on 17 June at Cooks Gardens in Wanganui. 2000+ spectators watch a 12 - 0 lesson handed out by the English on a sodden ground in steady rain. The match report from Wanganui in the New Zealand Herald started under the headline \"Goalkeeper's Holiday\" with the report further explicating, \"The Englishmen led 5-nil at halftime, their positional play, and short, snappy passing repeatedly undoing everything that their opponents accomplished. It was a treat to watch the cross-field tactics of the visitors and to note how carefully each kick placed the ball to a waiting team mate. But for the Wanganui goalkeeper, Alex Healey, the score would have been well in the twenties. His performance was remarkable considering that 90 per cent, of the play hovered around his goal. In contrast the English goalkeeper had time to sign autograph books while play was in progress.\" Apart from Healey, Whiting, left-half, and Proudfoot, left-back, were outstanding in the Wanganui-Taranaki team, which was never anything but a side of individuals. The paper then followed, \"The outstanding player on the English side was Bernard Joy, centre-half, who was never extended throughout the match but gave glimpses of what he would be capable of if pressed. The English team never passed the ball to disadvantage, whereas the home players would attempt combination only to find an Englishman ready to accept a pass not intended for him. Roy Matthews scored six goals, Bernard Joy two, William Parr two, and Fred Davies and Tommy Leek one each. Roy Matthews the English forward from Walthamstow Avenue F.C. reached an incredible 26 goals in the nine games of the New Zealand leg of the tour before the side left for Sydney. 1937 tour members, Lester Finch, Frederick Riley, John Sutcliffe, Louis Terry Huddle, Bernard Joy and Corporal Stan Eastham had all been members of the Great Britain Olympic team at the 1936 games in Berlin, Germany."]}, {"page": "Frederick Riley", "response": ["Frederick Riley may refer to:", "*Frederick Riley (footballer) (1912\u20131942), English footballer", "*Frederick Riley (trade unionist) (1886\u20131970), Australian politician"]}]}}
