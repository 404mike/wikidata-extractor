Eventually, Farnham Repertory Company outgrew its premises and moved to the newly built Redgrave Theatre in 1973. The first Artistic Director was Ian Mullins (1929\u20132014) from 1974 to 1977, followed by David Horlock from 1978 to 1979, Stephen Barry taking the position from 1982 to 1986, Patrick Sandford from 1986 to 1988, Graham Watkins from 1988 to 1994 and Roland Jaquarello from 1994 to 1995.", "By the 1990s interest in repertory theatre had declined and after closing down completely for a period Waverley Borough Council took over the theatre and began to show films and to stage plays which did not appeal to local audiences. Roland Jaquarello was appointed Artistic Director in 1994 but he was only able to direct one season, the \"incomprehensible\" The Playboy of the Western World, a commercial failure, before the theatre \"went dark\", temporarily closing in January 1995.Olivia Turnbull, Bringing Down the House: The Crisis in Britain's Regional Theatres \u2013 Google Books p153 Having endured long-term underfunding with a smaller than average subsidy,Turnbull, p146 the theatre made large financial losses during its final years and in 1998 the Council decided to permanently close the theatre and to demolish the building and develop the area. The Farnham Theatre Association (FTA) campaigned to either save the theatre or have a similar venue built in the town. The proposed developer of the East Street site, Crest Nicholson, has said the scheme will help to revitalise an under-used part of the area and will see the creation of more than 200 homes and more than 800 new jobs."]}]}}
