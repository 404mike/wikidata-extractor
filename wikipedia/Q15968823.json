At 15, she became the secretary of the Bradford Weavers' and Textile Workers' Union.In 1909 Varley moved to Birmingham and established a branch of the National Federation of Women Workers at the Cadbury factory at Bournville. She was also involved in the Cradley Heath women chainmakers' strike of 1910 and the Black Country strike of 1913, and later sat on the General Council of the Trade Union Congress.She was made OBE in 1931, and retired in 1938. She continued to live in Birmingham, before returning to Yorkshire, where she died in 1952.In May 2013, she was commemorated by the erection of a blue plaque at her former home in Hay Green Lane, Bournville, by the Birmingham Civic Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Black Country", "response": ["In 1913, the Black Country was the location of arguably one of the most important strikes in British trade union history when the workers employed in the area's steel tube trade came out for two months in a successful demand for a 23 shilling minimum weekly wage for unskilled workers, giving them pay parity with their counterparts in nearby Birmingham. This action commenced on 9 May in Wednesbury, at the Old Patent tube works of John Russell & Co. Ltd., and within weeks upwards of 40,000 workers across the Black Country had joined the dispute. Notable figures in the labour movement, including a key proponent of Syndicalism, Tom Mann, visited the area to support the workers and Jack Beard and Julia Varley of the Workers' Union were active in organising the strike. During this confrontation with employers represented by the Midlands Employers' Federation, a body founded by Dudley Docker, the Asquith Government's armaments programme was jeopardised, especially its procurement of naval equipment and other industrial essentials such as steel tubing, nuts and bolts, destroyer parts, etc. This was of national significance at a time when Britain and Germany were engaged in the Anglo-German naval arms race that preceded the outbreak of the First World War. Following a ballot of the union membership, a settlement of the dispute was reached on 11 July after arbitration by government officials from the Board of Trade led by the Chief Industrial Commissioner Sir George Askwith, 1st Baron Askwith.G. Askwith, Industrial Problems and Disputes (New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1920) One of the important consequences of the strike was the growth of organised labour across the Black Country, which was notable because until this point the area's workforce had effectively eschewed trade unionism."]}, {"page": "Bournville", "response": ["* Julia Varley, suffragette and trade unionist"]}, {"page": "Workers' Union", "response": ["Beard defeated Morley in the 1913 presidential election, his victory coming on the back of the recruitment of large numbers of semi-skilled engineering workers in the West Midlands by him, Arthur Ellery, and Julia Varley.
