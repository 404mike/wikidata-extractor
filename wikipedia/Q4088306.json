In a lecture at the RCM he was censorious of Berlioz who, in Parry's view, disguised commonplace musical ideas by glittering orchestration: \"When divested of its amazingly variegated colour  the ideas themselves do not convince us or exert much fascination.\"Allis, p. 111 Bax and others took this to mean that Parry (and Stanford and Mackenzie) \"regarded sensuous beauty of orchestral sound as not quite nice\".Bax, p. 28, quoted in Allis, p. 111  In 2001, the American writers Nicholas Slonimsky and Laura Kuhn took the view: \"In his orchestral music, Parry played a significant role in the fostering of the British symphonic tradition. While his orchestral works owe much to the German Romanticists, particularly Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms, he nevertheless developed a personal style notable for its fine craftsmanship and mastery of diatonic writing.

Audiences were also unpredictable, and Weldon was criticised for programming too much lightweight repertoire. The era saw some performances of new compositions including major works composed by the orchestra's oboist Ruth Gipps, and September 1946 brought Samuel Barber to Birmingham to conduct his own First Symphony, but Weldon repeated popular works multiple times, often twice or more within the same season. In 1946 Eric Blom criticised the orchestra for over-performance of Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on \"Greensleeves', with the orchestra responding by performing the work in a further concert, backwards. The music critic of the Birmingham Post was sacked in 1945 for writing that other music journalists in the city were covering up the orchestra's low standards, but by 1948 critics were writing openly of the orchestra's decline. An anti-Weldon lobby formed among Birmingham's musical establishment and unsubstantiated rumours circulated that he was conducting an affair with Gipps.
