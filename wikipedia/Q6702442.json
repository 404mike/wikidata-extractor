He was a regular for Arsenal U18s with 20 appearances and 2 goals in the 2004\u201305 season. With opportunities hard to come by, he left Highbury and had a trial with Wycombe, where he injured his ankle, before joining Coventry City for the 2005\u201306 season. His opportunities were again limited to reserve team football and he had a trial for Hereford after one season at Coventry. Despite a hamstring injury he impressed at Edgar Street and was signed in September 2006.\nHe made his first-team debut away to Wrexham, coming on as a substitute in the 1\u20130 defeat. On 21 November he started and scored in the 2\u20130 win in the FA Cup over Shrewsbury, following it up with an opening goal against Port Vale in the Second Round. In the final matches of the season, Webb forced his way into the starting XI after an injury to loanee Steve Jennings.\nHis 2007\u201308 season was curtailed by a long-term hip injury, making only 15 appearances and scoring 3 goals. He suffered a further injury setback in August 2008 and, with the club having fulfilled their contractual obligations, he was released.\nCurrently, Luke Webb works at Bradfield College, Berkshire where he teaches Business at A Level.
