His first production at Her Majesty's was a dramatisation of Gilbert Parker's The Seats of the Mighty.  Tree mounted new plays by prominent British playwrights, such as Carnac Sahib (1899) by Henry Arthur Jones.  His productions were exceptionally profitable; they were famous, most of all, for their elaborate and often spectacular scenery and effects.  Unlike some other famous actor-managers, Tree engaged the best actors available to join his company and hired the best designers and composers for the plays with incidental music.

The First World War badly affected his wish and ability to write. He had suffered an emotional blow in 1913 when his stepson killed himself, and the outbreak of war the following year appalled Pinero.

He became known for playing comedy character roles, noting, \"I am almost invariably cast for cowards, cads and snobs\", and he was particularly good at portraying harassed, misunderstood little men as, like his brother George, he was small in stature.

In 1888, an introduction by conductor Alberto Randegger to theatre manager Richard Mansfield led to German's appointment as conductor and musical director at the Globe Theatre in London. There he improved the orchestra and began providing incidental music for the theatre's lavish productions, starting with Richard III in 1889. This music was well received (The Times called for a concert suite to be arranged),The Times, 18 March 1889, p. 7 and the overture soon became popular in concert halls. This eventually led to other incidental music commissions that gained success. In 1892, German composed music for a production of Henry Irving's version of Henry VIII at the Lyceum Theatre, London, where he incorporated elements of traditional old English dance. Within a year, sheet music of the dance numbers from the play's score had sold 30,000 copies. German was by then in great demand to write music for plays. His commissions included Henry Arthur Jones's The Tempter in 1893, Johnston Forbes-Robertson's Romeo and Juliet at the Lyceum in 1895, Herbert Beerbohm Tree's productions of As You Like It (1896) and Much Ado about Nothing (1898), and Anthony Hope's English Nell (later known as Nell Gwynn) in 1900, starring Marie Tempest."]}, {"page": "Masquerade", "response": ["* The Masqueraders, an 1894 English play by Henry Arthur Jones", "* The Masqueraders (film), 1915 American silent film adaptation of the play by Henry Arthur Jones"]}, {"page": "New Woman", "response": ["Literary discussions of the expanding potential for women in English society date back at least to Maria Edgeworth's Belinda (1801) and Elizabeth Barrett's Aurora Leigh (1856), which explored a woman's plight between conventional marriage and the radical possibility that a woman could become an independent artist.
