It consisted of 154 Pretoria Volunteers, 129 Royal Scots Fusiliers, 74 Pretoria Carbineers, 62 Cavalry, 30 men of the 94th Regiment, 170 mounted men including 45 mounted infantery, 39 men of the Royal Artillery, a 9 and 7 pounder field gun and a gun mounted cart. The force was under the command of Lt-Col George Frederick Gildea and Col William Bellairs and left for the laager at 4.00 am. An additional force of Royal Engineers under the command of Lieutenant R.P. Littledale had been sent out earlier to create a diversion a few kilometers east of the laagers location. This diversion was made by exploding some dynamite at 6 am, when the main force was halfway to their destination. The distraction succeeded in drawing away a small band of Boer fighters towards the direction of the explosions."]}]}}
