It stars Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson, all in their film debuts. Set in 1994, Fitzpatrick, Pierce, Sevigny, Dawson, and other newcomers portray a group of teenagers in New York City. They are characterized as hedonists, who engage in sexual acts and substance abuse, throughout the course of a single day. Ben Detrick of the New York Times has described the film as \"Lord of the Flies with skateboards, nitrous oxide and hip-hop... There is no thunderous moral reckoning, only observational detachment.\" The film was deemed controversial upon its release in 1995 and caused public debate over its artistic merit. It received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, but was released without a rating. Critical response was mixed, and the film grossed $20.4 million on a $1.5 million budget.", "* Justin Pierce as Casper", "In Kids, Clark cast New York City \"street\" kids with no previous acting experience, notably Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly) and Justin Pierce (Casper).

Korine had met Chlo\u00eb Sevigny in New York before production began on Kids, and initially cast her in a small role as one of the girls in the swimming pool. She was given the leading role of Jennie when the actress hired to play her, Mia Kirshner, was fired. Sevigny and Korine went on to make  Gummo (1997) together.

The first Supreme store opened in an old office space on Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan in April 1994. It was designed with skaters in mind with a unique design for the store layout: by arranging the clothes around the perimeter of the store, a large central space permitted skaters with backpacks to skate into the store and still feel comfortable. This store had its core group of skaters who served as its team in 1994, which included late actors Justin Pierce and Harold Hunter, and the first employees were extras from the Larry Clark film Kids. Jebbia explained that he opened Supreme in lower Manhattan  because at the time there was nowhere else to buy skate products in the area. He focused primarily on more obscure, harder-to-find items and credited the open-mindedness of skaters with the brand's ability to take risks.", "The original Supreme skate team consisted of Ryan Hickey, Justin Pierce, Gio Estevez, Paul Leung, Harry Jumonji, Chris Keeffe, Jones Keeffe, Peter Bici, and Mike Hernandez.
