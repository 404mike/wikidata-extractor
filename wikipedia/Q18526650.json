Deacon graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and was awarded a grant for anthropological fieldwork in Malakula. He arrived there in January 1926 and died there on 12 March 1927 of blackwater fever.Deacon's fieldwork was edited by Camilla Wedgwood into an ethnography in 1934. Wedgwood incorporated the notes of the earlier field-worker John Layard into the book without Layard's knowledge and following threats of legal action the first edition only appeared with Layard's comments. The book was  drawn on by both later ethnographers and present-day inhabitants of the islands, although later fieldwork by Margaret Patterson radically reinterpreted his evidence on the Ambrym marriage system.Deacon had known Margaret Gardiner, a fellow student, for more than a year before leaving Cambridge, but they only started a relationship on the evening before his departure from Cambridge. Although they exchanged many letters, and arranged to meet in Australia to live as a couple, they never met again. Gardiner's memoir of Deacon was published in 1984.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Camilla Wedgwood", "response": ["After leaving the University of Cambridge, Wedgwood returned to Bedford College, London as an assistant lecturer in its Department of Social Studies. After Arthur Bernard Deacon death in 1927, she was invited to move to the University of Sydney to replace him as lecturer in anthropology. She was also asked by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown to edit Deacon's remaining field notes in preparation for publication: they were published as \"Malekula: A Vanishing People in the New Hebrides\" in 1934. In 1930, she held a temporary lectureship in the Department of African Life and Languages at the University of Cape Town. From 1930 to 1932, having returned to England, she was a lecturer at the London School of Economics and personal assistant to Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski."]}]}}
