Several scholars have disagreed with this, taking the Magna Moralia to be an authentic work by Aristotle, notably Friedrich Schleiermacher, Hans von Arnim, and J. L. Ackrill.  In any case, it is considered a less mature piece than Aristotle's other ethical works, viz. the Nicomachean Ethics, the Eudemian Ethics, and Virtues and Vices. There is some debate as to whether they follow more closely the Eudemian or the Nicomachean version of the Ethics."]}, {"page": "David Wiggins", "response": ["David Wiggins was born on 8 March 1933 in London,\"Wiggins, David (1933\u2013)\" in The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy (2006) the son of Norman and Diana Wiggins (n\u00e9e Priestley).'Who's Who 2012, London, A. & C.
