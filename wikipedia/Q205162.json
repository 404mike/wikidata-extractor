Although he became increasingly averse to writing for publication, his improvised lectures and talks were sometimes recorded and transcribed, and many of his spoken words were converted into published essays and books, both by himself and by others, especially his principal editor from 1974, Henry Hardy.\nBorn in Riga (now the capital of Latvia, then a part of the Russian Empire) in 1909, he moved to Petrograd, Russia, at the age of six, where he witnessed the revolutions of 1917. In 1921 his family moved to the UK, and he was educated at St Paul's School, London, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1932, at the age of twenty-three, Berlin was elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. In addition to his own prolific output, he translated works by Ivan Turgenev from Russian into English and, during World War II, worked for the British Diplomatic Service. From 1957 to 1967 he was Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at the University of Oxford. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1963 to 1964. In 1966, he played a critical role in creating Wolfson College, Oxford, and became its founding President. Berlin was appointed a CBE in 1946, knighted in 1957, and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1971. He was President of the British Academy from 1974 to 1978. He also received the 1979 Jerusalem Prize for his lifelong defence of civil liberties, and on 25 November 1994 he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws at the University of Toronto, for which occasion he prepared a \"short credo\" (as he called it in a letter to a friend), now known as \"A Message to the Twenty-First Century\", to be read on his behalf at the ceremony.An annual Isaiah Berlin Lecture is held at the Hampstead Synagogue, at Wolfson College, Oxford, at the British Academy, and in Riga. Berlin's work on liberal theory and on value pluralism, as well as his opposition to Marxism and Communism, has had a lasting influence.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Hume", "response": ["Danish theologian and philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard adopted \"Hume's suggestion that the role of reason is not to make us wise but to reveal our ignorance,\" though taking it as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or fideism.

Political freedom was described as freedom from oppressionIris Marion Young, \"Five Faces of Oppression\", Justice and the Politics of Difference\" (Princeton University press, 1990), 39\u201365. or coercion,Michael Sandel, Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?

Although political freedom is often interpreted negatively as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action,Isaiah Berlin, Liberty (Oxford 2004). it can also refer to the positive exercise of rights, capacities and possibilities for action and the exercise of social or group rights.Charles Taylor, \"What's Wrong With Negative Liberty?\", Philosophy and the Human Sciences: Philosophical Papers (Cambridge, 1985), 211\u2013229. The concept can also include freedom from internal constraints on political action or speech (e.g. social conformity, consistency, or inauthentic behaviour).Ralph Waldo Emerson, \"Self-Reliance\"; Nikolas Kompridis, \"Struggling Over the Meaning of Recognition: A Matter of Identity, Justice or Freedom?\" in European Journal of Political Theory July 2007 vol. 6 no. 3 pp. 277\u2013289. The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of civil liberties and human rights, which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the state."]}, {"page": "Feminist science fiction", "response": ["Representations of utopian and dystopian societies in feminist science fiction place an increased emphasis on gender roles while countering the anti-utopian philosophies of the 20th century. Male philosophers such as John Rawls, Isaiah Berlin, and Michael Oakeshott often criticize the idea of utopia, theorizing that it would be impossible to establish a utopia without violence and hegemony. Many male authored works of science fiction as well as threads of philosophical utopian thought dismiss utopias as something unattainable, whereas in feminist science fiction, utopian society is often presented as something both achievable and desirable."]}, {"page": "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel", "response": ["Isaiah Berlin listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern authoritarianism who undermined liberal democracy, along with Rousseau, Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius, Fichte, Saint-Simon and Joseph de Maistre.Berlin, Isaiah, Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty (Princeton University Press, 2003)"]}, {"page": "Giuseppe Verdi", "response": ["The writer Friedrich Schiller (four of whose plays were adapted as operas by Verdi) distinguished two types of artist in his 1795 essay On Na\u00efve and Sentimental Poetry. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin ranked Verdi in the 'na\u00efve' category\u2014\"They are not...self-conscious. They do not...stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings....They are able...if they have genius, to embody their vision fully.\" (The 'sentimentals' seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms\u2014Berlin instances Richard Wagner\u2014\"offering not peace, but a sword\".) Verdi's operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory, or with a purpose to change the tastes of their audiences. In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that, whilst \"there was much to be admired in [Wagner's operas] Tannh\u00e4user and Lohengrin...in his recent operas [Wagner] seemed to be overstepping the bounds of what can be expressed in  music. For him \"philosophical\" music was incomprehensible.\" Although Verdi's works belong, as Rosselli admits \"to the most artificial of genres...[they] ring emotionally true: truth and directness make them exciting, often hugely so.\""]}, {"page": "June 6", "response": ["*1909 \u2013 Isaiah Berlin, Latvian-English historian and philosopher (d. 1997)"]}, {"page": "Jawaharlal Nehru", "response": ["| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Nehru was a great man...
