Warney Cresswell was appointed as manager for the club's 1936\u201337 campaign, with the aim of promotion. Tom Nolan was also brought back from Bradford. After a mid-table finish Creswell left the club. A young Eric Hayward was transferred to Blackpool, Ken Gunn moved onto Northampton Town and Allan Todd went to Nottingham Forest.

He was unable to prevent the 1937\u201338 season being another story of mid-table mediocrity. Jack Roberts impressive tally of 28 goals was the only ray of hope for escaping the division. At the end of the season roughly half the team were transferred or let go.
