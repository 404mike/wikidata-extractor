He also played for Oxford University and for a variety of amateur teams. As a cricketer, he was known as \"A. E.\", not by his forename.Newton was a right-handed lower order batsman and a wicket-keeper. Educated at Eton College, he played in the Lord's matches against Harrow School for three years and then went to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he appeared in the freshmen's trial match in 1882. But he did not get into the university team until 1885, when he made his first-class debut in the match against Lancashire. In his third match, batting at No 9, he made 57 against Surrey. He retained his place as wicket-keeper to win his blue in the University match against Cambridge at Lord's.At the end of the 1885 season, Newton was a member of an amateur side raised by the Devon cricketer Edward Sanders that played matches in North America, with two of the games later being designated as first-class. Two years later, he was a member of a rather larger touring side, this time organised by George Vernon and including Lord Hawke, Andrew Stoddart and professionals such as Bobby Abel and Bobby Peel, which toured Australia for five months in the winter of 1887\u201388, playing first-class matches and a variety of other games against state and scratch teams. Vernon's team was a strong one. One of the bigger matches of the tour was at Melbourne Cricket Ground against an Australian XI which contained 10 Test players: Vernon's XI won by an innings and Newton, one of only three non-Test players in his team, made 77, starting a revival in his team's single innings after the first six wickets had fallen for 51 runs to a final total of 292. The innings of 77 remained the highest of Newton's long career, not surpassed, though he equalled it in 1900.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club", "response": ["| Arthur Newton"]}, {"page": "William Brain", "response": ["Born in Clifton, Bristol, Brain was a member of the Clifton College\"Clifton College Register\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p98: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 XI, captaining it in 1889. He went up to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1889 and made his first-class debut for Oxford University in 1891 against Lancashire, in the same year hitting his only half-century by making 65 not out (with no teammate scoring more than 13) in his only appearance for MCC, against Somerset.

In 1912, the club made a loss of \u00a3327, and they could not persuade Daniell to remain at the club rather than travel to India. Initially the county asked Arthur Newton, who was at that time 50 years old, to serve as captain, but after consideration he declined the role, and Poyntz was appointed instead. The team that he inherited remained a poor one: the Wisden summary in 1913 stated that they had, \"no temptation to deal at any great length with the doings of Somerset\".Roebuck (1991), p. 109. During a season in which his side had finished bottom of the championship with only two wins, Poyntz scored 363 runs at an average of 15.12, with a single half-century; 50 runs exactly scored against Derbyshire. The club once again recorded a loss during the season, and at the club's annual general meeting, the mood was negative. Despite this, Poyntz was reappointed as captain for 1914 after a proposal made by Bruce Hylton-Stewart and seconded by Newton. Rare optimism was shown by Newton and Poyntz, with the latter claiming that it was due to \"a lot of bad luck that they [Somerset] did not finish half way up the table instead of at the bottom.\"Roebuck (1991), p. 112."]}, {"page": "Harry Chidgey", "response": ["Chidgey was the elder son of the innkeeper at the Angel Inn in Flax Bourton.
