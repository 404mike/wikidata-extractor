Screened on Norwegian television on 30 November 2010, the film broadcast the allegation that Yunus stashed approximately $100\u00a0million in 1996 into Grameen Kalyan, a sister company of Grameen Bank. however, Yunus denied the allegations. After completing a full investigation, the Norwegian government found Yunus innocent. However, Prime Minister Hasina used the situation as to increase sustained attacks on Yunus: these included claims that Yunus' age means he is too old to run the bank, Grameen has created companies unlawfully, and the bank operates as an organ of the government. The bank has denied all illegalities, arguing, among other things, that age limits do not apply in this case since Grameen, like BRAC, is a special bank. Yunus has also become subject to legal harassment over three criminal cases. A criminal defamation case was filed against Yunus for criticising politicians in 2007. A food inspector filed another case against Yunus, alleging that yogurt manufactured by the Grameen-Danone was adulterated. The final blow came on 3 March 2011. Bangladesh Bank informed Grameen in a letter that Yunus had been removed from Grameen, citing that he was older than the mandatory retirement age of 60, even though nine of the bank's directors-who were elected by 8.3\u00a0million Grameen Bank borrowers-allowed him to stay on the job after he had crossed that threshold. Backed by nine boards of directors, 22\u00a0thousand employees, and 8.3\u00a0million Grameen borrowers, Yunus defied the government order, returned to Grameen's headquarters in Dhaka, and lodged an appeal at Dhaka High Court against the decision. However, Justice Mohammad Momtazuddin Ahmed and Justice Gobinda Chandra Tagore delivered the verdict against Yunus, claiming that Yunus' posting as the MD of Grameen since 1999 was illegal as he had reached the age of 60 by then. However, Yunus still did not lose faith in the justice system. Backed by international leaders (e.g., Hillary and Bill Clinton), national leaders (e.g., Sir Fazle Hasan Abed) and 8.3\u00a0million Grameen borrowers, Yunus filed an appeal in Bangladesh Supreme Court against the High Court's verdict. The full bench of the Appellate Division headed by Chief Justice ABM Khairul Haque heard the appeal on 15 March and delivered the verdict which upheld Yunus removal by government.", "* Fazle Hasan Abed"]}, {"page": "List of Bangladeshi people", "response": ["* Fazle Hasan Abed,  founder of BRAC", "* Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, founder and chairperson of the world's largest international development NGO, BRAC"]}, {"page": "Mahbub ul Haq", "response": ["* 2004 \u2013 Fazle Hasan Abed, founder of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC)."]}, {"page": "Rikkyo University", "response": ["*Fazle Hasan Abed - Founder and Chairman of BRAC (NGO) (2009)"]}, {"page": "List of social entrepreneurs", "response": ["| Fazle Hasan Abed || Bangladesh || BRAC ||  poverty reduction, banking, food security, education, woman empowerment"]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["* Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, founder of world's largest NGO, BRAC"]}, {"page": "BRAC (organisation)", "response": ["BRAC is an international development organisation based in Bangladesh.
