He was capped by Scotland at U21 level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["The final game of the season was against Crewe Alexandra, featuring a young David Platt, at Plainmoor. At half-time Crewe were leading 2\u20130 and things looked bad for Torquay, two minutes into the second-half Torquay's centre-half, Jim McNichol, scored from a free kick but despite an all-out attack, Torquay seem unable to get the equaliser even hitting the crossbar. Tranmere secured safety by winning their final game on the Friday night. Burnley were winning their game, and while Lincoln were being beaten by Swansea, they would still finish above Torquay by a single point as things stood.", "Seven minutes from time a piece of football folklore was created. A police dog by the name of Bryn appeared to think that Jim McNichol was running to attack his handler, and sank his teeth into the centre-half's thigh. It was during the resultant four minutes of injury time that Paul Dobson scored possibly the most important goal in the club's history, and kept them in the Football League, with Lincoln dropping into the GM Vauxhall Conference. This was dubbed by many as \"The Great Escape\" \u2013 something United fans have had to become very familiar with in subsequent years."]}, {"page": "Kenny Allen (footballer)", "response": ["By now his grey hair and moustache made him instantly recognisable and he helped Torquay to remain in league football, playing in the first great escape when Torquay drew 2\u20132 with Crewe Alexandra at Plainmoor thanks to a late equaliser from Paul Dobson and help from the police dog Bryn biting Jim McNichol ensuring that injury time would be required. The following season, he was an ever-present as Cyril Knowles' side made the play-offs, but was released in the summer, joining Bath City in July 1988. He began the season as a regular, but after only nine games, broke his leg while conceding a penalty against Dorchester Town. He regained his fitness, but was released in February 1989."]}, {"page": "Stuart Morgan", "response": ["He was appointed manager of Weymouth in November 1978, guiding them to second place in the Alliance Premier League in 1979\u201380. He left Weymouth in November 1983, returning to Bournemouth as part of Harry Redknapp's coaching staff, where he remained until September 1985 when Morgan was appointed as manager of Torquay United. Torquay finished bottom of Division Four that season, the last before automatic relegation to the Conference would begin. The next season Torquay struggled again and only survived on the last day of the season, at Lincoln City's expense, thanks to a late equaliser against Crewe Alexandra from Paul Dobson in injury time added after Torquay defender Jim McNichol had been bitten by a police dog."]}]}}
