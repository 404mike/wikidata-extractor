Later he worked as a music journalist, A&R man and in the late 1970s he became a record producer.\nAs a record producer, Thorne has worked on albums by artists of various genres of rock, including punk, post-punk, jazz fusion and also pop. He has produced for artists including Roger Daltrey, John Cale, Bronski Beat, Soft Cell, Nina Hagen, Laurie Anderson and Soft Machine.\nHis more notable productions include the seminal first three records by Wire: Pink Flag, Chairs Missing and 154; and Soft Cell's cover version of \"Tainted Love\" (which was a UK number 1 single for two weeks and sold 1.35m copies in the UK).

However, the single was shelved as tensions in the band, both personal and political, resulted in Somerville leaving Bronski Beat in the summer of that year.", "In 1989, Jonathan Hellyer became lead singer, and the band extensively toured the U.S. and Europe with back-up vocalist Annie Conway. They achieved one minor hit with the song \"Cha Cha Heels\", a one-off collaboration sung by American actress and singer Eartha Kitt, which peaked at 32 in the UK. The song was originally written for movie and recording star Divine, who was unable to record the song before his death in 1988. 1990\u201391 saw Bronski Beat release three further singles on the Zomba record label, \"I'm Gonna Run Away\", \"One More Chance\" and \"What More Can I Say\".

Some time after, Soft Cell began performing the song in their live setlist, choosing it instead of Frankie Valli's \"The Night\". (a song they would go on to record in 2003) Eventually, a Phonogram Records A&R manager Roger Ames opted the band to record the single at a London-based Advision Studios, with producer Mike Thorne. There, Soft Cell's version was recorded in a day and a half with Almond's first vocal take being used on the record. Thorne commented that he was surprised by the choice as he had not been impressed by the 1976 version on hearing it, but was impressed by the new arrangement and Almond's sinister vocal: \"You could smell the coke on that second, Northern Soul version, it was really so over-ramped and so frantic.
