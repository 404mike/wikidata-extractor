This would have positioned Black voices into a genuinely powerful position to reclaim their history in an authentic way. Instead, a moment of social change that should have been about bringing equality and real opportunities to Black people has been hijacked.\""]}, {"page": "Reaching Out (sculpture)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas J.
