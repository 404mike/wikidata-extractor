Writing for the Savannah Morning News, Reed gives a mostly positive assessment: he describes the film as \"flawed\" yet \"ambitious and somewhat mesmerizing\", as well as \"experimental\". Peter Hutchings considers the film \"bizarre\" but adds that the \"sustained seriousness\" of Warren's direction and the \"doom-filled atmosphere\" save Prey from becoming a \"piece of camp nonsense\". Fred Beldin of AllMovie is critical, summing up Prey as a \"dismal, unsettling film\" with \"occasional arthouse pretensions\" that is \"difficult to watch even for exploitation fans\". He notes the film's unrelenting tension and \"claustrophia\", remarking: \"deaths seem like appropriate punctuation at the end of a miserable sentence, giving the film a grim tone of hopelessness that few will derive pleasure from\". He criticises Sally Faulkner's performance as being \"particularly grating\".
