Indeed, their work sought to emphasize functionality and connect architecture with what they viewed as the realities of modern life in post-war Britain. Their definitions and interpretation of Brutalism put them at odds with their contemporary Reyner Banham, an architecture critic known for his work in defining the stylistic components of New Brutalism. Alison Smithson articulated their desire to connect building, users, and site when, describing architecture as an act of \"form-giving\", she noted: \"My act of form-giving has to invite the occupiers to add their intangible quality of use.\" After the critical success of Hunstanton School, they were associated with Team X and its 1953 revolt against old Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) philosophies of high modernism."]}, {"page": "Brutalist architecture", "response": ["Descending from the modernist movement, Brutalism is said to be a reaction against the nostalgia of architecture in the 1940s. Derived from the Swedish phrase nybrutalism, the term \"New Brutalism\" was first used by British architects Alison and Peter Smithson for their pioneering approach to design. The style was further popularised in a 1955 essay by architectural critic Reyner Banham, who also associated the movement with the French phrases b\u00e9ton brut (\"raw concrete\") and art brut (\"raw art\"). The style, as developed by architects such as the Smithsons, Hungarian-born Ern\u0151 Goldfinger, and the British firm  Chamberlin, Powell & Bon, was partly foreshadowed by the modernist work of other architects such as French-Swiss Le Corbusier, Estonian-American Louis Kahn, German-American Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Finnish Alvar Aalto.", "The term Nybrutalism (New Brutalism) was coined by the Swedish architect Hans Asplund to describe Villa G\u00f6th, a modern brick home in Uppsala, designed in January 1950Hans Asplund's letter to Eric De Mare, Architectural Review, August 1956 by his contemporaries Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm. Showcasing the 'as found' design approach that would later be at the core of Brutalism the house displays visible I-beams over windows, exposed brick inside and out, and poured concrete in several rooms where the tongue-and-groove pattern of the boards used to build the forms can be seen. The term was picked up in the summer of 1950 by a group of visiting English architects, including Michael Ventris, Oliver Cox, and Graeme Shankland, where it apparently \"spread like wildfire, and subsequently adopted by a certain faction of young British architects\".The New Brutalism, Reyner Banham, Architectural Press, London 1966, p10", "The first published usage of the phrase \"New Brutalism\" occurred in 1953, when Alison Smithson used it to describe a plan for their unbuilt Soho house which appeared in the November issue of Architectural Design. She further stated \"It is our intention in this building to have the structure exposed entirely, without interior finishes wherever practicable.\" The Smithsons' Hunstanton School completed in 1954 in Norfolk, and the Sugden House completed in 1955 in Watford, represent the earliest examples of New Brutalism in the United Kingdom. Hunstanton school, likely inspired by Mies Van Der Rohe's 1946 Alumni Memorial Hall at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, United States, is notable as the first completed building in the world to carry the title of \"New Brutalist\" by its architects.The New Brutalism, Reyner Banham, Architectural Press, London 1966, p. 19Brutalism: Post-War British Architecture, Alexander Clement, Second Edition, Chapter 3 At the time, it was described as \"the most truly modern building in England\".", "The term gained increasingly wider recognition when British architectural historian Reyner Banham used it to identify both an ethic and aesthetic style, in his 1955 essay The New Brutalism. In the essay, Banham described Hunstanton and the Soho house as the \"reference by which The New Brutalism in architecture may be defined.\" Reyner Banham also associated the term New Brutalism with Art Brut and b\u00e9ton brut, meaning raw concrete in French, for the first time.McClelland, Michael, and Graeme Stewart, \"Concrete Toronto: A Guide to Concrete Architecture from the Fifties to the Seventies, Coach House Books, 2007, p. 12.British Brutalism.

", "Banham further expanded his thoughts in the 1966 book, The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?, to characterise a somewhat recently established cluster of architectural approaches, particularly in Europe. In the book, Banham says that Le Corbusier's concrete work was a source of inspiration and helped popularise the movement, suggesting \"if there is one single verbal formula that has made the concept of Brutalism admissible in most of the world's Western languages, it is that Le Corbusier himself described that concrete work as 'b\u00e9ton-brut'\".The New Brutalism, Reyner Banham, Architectural Press, London 1966 p. 16 He further states that \"the words 'The New Brutalism' were already circulating, and had acquired some depth of meaning through things said and done, over and above the widely recognised connection with b\u00e9ton brut. The phrase still 'belonged' to the Smithsons, however, and it was their activities above all others that were giving distinctive qualities to the concept of Brutalism.\"", "Peter Smithson believed that the core of Brutalism was a reverence for materials, expressed honestly, stating \"Brutalism is not concerned with the material as such but rather the quality of material\",Hans Ulrich Obrist, Smithson Time (Cologne, Verlag der Buch- handlung Walther K\u00f6nig, 2004), p. 17 and \"the seeing of materials for what they were: the woodness of the wood; the sandiness of sand.\"A. and P.

Reyner Banham felt the phrase \"the New Brutalism\" existed as both an attitude toward design as well as a descriptive label for the architecture itself and that it \"eludes precise description, while remaining a living force\". He attempted to codify the movement in systematic language, insisting that a Brutalist structure must satisfy the following terms, \"1, Formal legibility of plan; 2, clear exhibition of structure, and 3, valuation of materials for their inherent qualities 'as found'.\" Also important was the aesthetic \"image\", or \"coherence of the building as a visual entity\".", "* Golan, Romy: Historian of the Immediate Future: Reyner Banham \u2013 Book Review.

Wolf Von Eckardt wrote for The Washington Post in 1978, \"I believe Johnson may well unite contemporary architecture again and lead it out of both the glass box and the concrete sculpture to a new ecumenic gentility.\" Similarly, critic Reyner Banham thought the building had the potential to reshape architecture in New York City and in the postmodern era. The effect on the public at large has been described as legitimizing the postmodern movement globally. Johnson described the building as \"a symbolic shift from the flat top\" of International Style skyscrapers like the nearby Lever House.
