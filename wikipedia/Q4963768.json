After a few appearances for Middlesbrough Teessiders in 1968, he rode for Canterbury Crusaders and Romford Bombers in 1969. He stayed with Romford in 1970 and also made his debut in the first division of the British League with Wembley Lions, averaging a respectable 4.8 points from two meetings. He made his first appearance for the second division representative 'Young England' team in 1970, against Czechoslovakia, going on to further appearances in 1972. In 1971 he further improved for Romford, averaging eight points per match in the second division. Progress in 1972 for West Ham Bombers and Rayleigh Rockets saw him get further division one opportunities for Leicester Lions and Ipswich Witches and in 1973 he rode in 21 league matches for Leicester, averaging just over three points. While not making the grade at the top level, he continued to score highly in the second division (later named the National League) for Rye House Rockets until his retirement in 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pattern Languages of Programs", "response": ["| Brian Foote", "| James Noble, Brian Foote"]}, {"page": "1972 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|Canterbury || Bob Young || Malcolm Ballard || Brian Foote"]}, {"page": "List of Leicester Lions riders", "response": ["*Brian Foote  1968-1973"]}, {"page": "Foote, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Foote"]}]}}
