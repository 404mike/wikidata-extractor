From 1967 to 1969, he undertook research at the Oxford Centre for Management Studies.  An activist in the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP), he was appointed Party Secretary in 1969, and held the post through the 1970s.\nAs the NILP lost members, McIldoon focused on his career at the Department of the Environment.  For three years from 1990, he was seconded to the European Commission.  In 1995, he was appointed head of The Utility Regulator in Northern Ireland, a role in which he adopted a high profile and was credited by the Belfast Telegraph with achieving lower prices for electricity users.  He retired in the 2000s, but was commissioned to produce a report on Northern Irish energy prices in 2008.When the British Labour Party began admitting members in Northern Ireland, Holmes joined.  However, the party refused to stand any candidates in the region, and in 2016 McIldoon was part of a group which founded the Northern Ireland Labour Representation Committee, a parallel group with the primary purpose of contesting elections, becoming its treasurer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Labour Party in Northern Ireland", "response": ["In December 2015, the LPNI's executive committee voted to contest elections in Northern Ireland. In the run-up to the 2016 Assembly elections, local members registered a new party, the Northern Ireland Labour Representation Committee, with the Electoral Commission recognising them in April 2016. The party's constitution has a clause stating that it will disband once Labour lifts the ban on contesting elections in Northern Ireland. The new party's leader is journalist and author Kathryn Johnston. Several former members of the Northern Ireland Labour Party hold membership, including Erskine Holmes and Douglas McIldoon. Eight candidates ran under the label, despite the Labour Party warning Northern Irish Labour party members that they could face expulsion from the party for standing as candidates, as Labour party members who support a political organisation outside the Labour group can be expelled. Johnston highlighted policy differences with the SDLP, including Labour's position on abortion, same-sex marriage and support for an integrated and secular education system. The move to stand in elections was assisted by former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay. They stood one candidate each in eight of the eighteen constituencies in the 2016 Assembly elections. They won no seats, with candidates obtaining between 0.2% and 0.7% of the first-preference votes. After the 2016 assembly election, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had publicly stated that he would consider candidates for the next election, stating, \"There is a democratic deficit in one sense. There is a question of a relationship with other parties in Northern Ireland as well and how that will be affected.\""]}]}}
