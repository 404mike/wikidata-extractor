The season started very well with Brighton born debutant Darren Freeman scoring a hat-trick in a 6\u20130 demolition of Mansfield in the first game of the season. Brighton's early season form was very patchy as they struggled to find consistency as a rebuilt squad struggled to gel. This early season inconsistency was carried over into the New Year. One bright point was Darren Freeman becoming the first goal scorer of the new millennium when he scored after just 2 minutes against Exeter City on 3 January 2000. In February 2000 Brighton signed a little known forward on loan from Bristol Rovers called Bobby Zamora. Zamora made an instant impact scoring in his debut, the 1\u20131 home draw with Plymouth. Brighton lost their next game away at Northampton 1\u20130, this was to prove their last defeat of the season as the following game a Zamora hat-trick inspired them to a 7\u20131 win at Chester City.
