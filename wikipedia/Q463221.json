She had ended her contract with United Artists, whose former record division was now part of EMI, and began what she referred to as \"semi-retirement\". Bassey recorded an album entitled All by Myself (1982) and made a TV special for Thames Television called A Special Lady with guest Robert Goulet. Around this time she recorded a duet with the French film actor Alain Delon, \"Thought I'd Ring You\" (1983). Bassey was now recording far less often but an album of her most famous songs, I Am What I Am (1984), was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) conducted by Carl Davis. This was followed by a single and video to support the London Tourist Board, \"There's No Place Like London\" (1986), which was co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Gerard Kenny. She recorded an album of James Bond themes, The Bond Collection in 1987, but was apparently unhappy with the results so she declined to release it.

It featured an all-star cast including Tommy Cooper, Bernard Cribbins, Jimmy Edwards, Irene Handl, Bob Todd, and Andrew Sachs. Sykes produced one further silent movie for Thames in 1988, Mr. H. Is Late, set at a funeral. In 1984, Sykes played the Genie in the children's film Gabrielle and the Doodleman, which also featured Windsor Davies (who would also appear with Sykes in the BBC's Gormenghast in 2000), Bob Todd, Lynsey de Paul, and Gareth Hunt."]}, {"page": "John Pilger", "response": ["Pilger was successful in gaining a regular television outlet at ATV. The Pilger half-hour documentary series was commissioned by Charles Denton, then a producer with ATV, for screening on the British ITV network.

Ralphs left in August 1973 to form Bad Company and was replaced by former Spooky Tooth guitarist Luther Grosvenor.

It was largely due to him that \"I'm Still Waiting\" by Diana Ross, which was initially just an album track, was released as a single in the UK in 1971 and reached number one. He was a regular host of Top of the Pops for a decade until 1979 and he appeared with fellow DJ's Noel Edmonds and Kenny Everett on the 500th anniversary show where he performed the spoken part of \"Won't Somebody Dance With Me\" and then danced with singer Lynsey de Paul. In 1968, he fronted his own show, Time For Blackburn, produced by Southern Television for the ITV network. \"The Radio 1 DJs were a massive attraction. We were mobbed everywhere we went\", Blackburn told Simon Hattenstone, referring to personal appearances. \"It was all a bit mad, but great fun\", he told Judith Woods in 2014. We \"were built up to be stars in our own right, and as a result we were as famous as the artists we played.\"", "In 1972 he released a self named album on the RCA label. Two of the tracks were released as singles: \"Chop Chop\", written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, and \"House of Cards\", written by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Green.

The single was re-released as a  single under the pseudonym Lenny Gamble on Casino Classics in June 1978, with the pseudonym being a portmanteau of songwriters Leon Huff and Kenny Gamble. Blackburn was allegedly furious when Noel Edmonds revealed the alias on air. Nevertheless, Blackburn and Edmonds became close friends. All of the Blackburn's singles, including \"I'll Do Anything\" and \"House of Cards\" were finally released in 2012 on a CD compilation album The Singles Collection 1965\u20131980 on the Cherry Red label."]}, {"page": "Clodagh Rodgers", "response": ["In 1996, the first of two CD retrospectives was issued, bringing Rodgers back into the limelight.

The winning song was \"Rock Bottom\", written, composed and performed by Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran. The song says that when people are in a bad situation they should work to solve problems and not be pessimistic about tragedies. Apparently it represents the situation at the time. This was reflected in the unrest surrounding the 1977 Song for Europe and the subsequent Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to take place in Wembley on 2 April. Due to the cameramen's industrial action that spread throughout the BBC, many live broadcasts were affected in the coming weeks and the 1977 Eurovision final was cancelled.
