The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality, however, and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare's original.", "In his 1562 narrative poem The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, Arthur Brooke translated Boaistuau faithfully but adjusted it to reflect parts of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. There was a trend among writers and playwrights to publish works based on Italian novelle\u2014Italian tales were very popular among theatre-goers\u2014and Shakespeare may well have been familiar with William Painter's 1567 collection of Italian tales titled Palace of Pleasure. This collection included a version in prose of the Romeo and Juliet story named \"The goodly History of the true and constant love of Romeo and Juliett\". Shakespeare took advantage of this popularity: The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, and Romeo and Juliet are all from Italian novelle. Romeo and Juliet is a dramatization of Brooke's translation, and Shakespeare follows the poem closely but adds detail to several major and minor characters (the Nurse and Mercutio in particular)."]}, {"page": "1563", "response": ["* March 19 \u2013 Arthur Brooke, English poet"]}, {"page": "Pyramus and Thisbe", "response": ["The tragedy of Romeo and Juliet ultimately sprang from Ovid's story.

The earliest version of Romeo and Juliet was published in 1476 by Masuccio Salernitano, while it mostly obtained its present form when written down in 1524 by Luigi da Porto. Salernitano and Da Porto both are thought to have been inspired by Ovid and Boccaccio's writing.

Arthur Brooke's The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet and William Painter's 1567 versions of the story both left the entire episode solely to Romeo and Tybalt. In both stories, Tybalt attacks the pacifist Romeo with such force that Romeo is forced to take up the sword to defend himself. He is then banished rather than executed because the killing was provoked. In 1672, English poet John Dryden wrote, \"Shakespeare show'd the best of his skill in his Mercutio, and he said himself, that he was forced to murder  him in the third Act, to  being killed by him.\""]}, {"page": "Juliet", "response": ["Even Capulet tries to encourage Paris to wait a little longer before even thinking of marrying his daughter, feeling that she is still too young; \"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, Let two more summers wither in their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride\". However, in the English poem the story is based on (Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke)The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, Arthur Brooke. Juliet is approaching her sixteenth birthday and Romeo is the same age whereas in the Bandello novella she is nearly eighteen with Romeo about twenty. The common English people of that age were very rarely in their teens when they married and even among the nobility and gentry of the age, brides 13 years of age were rare, at about one in 1,000 brides; in that era, the vast majority of English brides were at least 19 years of age when they first married, most commonly at about 23 years, and most English noblewomen were at least 16 when they married. That the parts of young women were played by pre-adolescent boys in Shakespeare's day also cannot be overlooked; it is possible that Shakespeare had the physique of a young boy in mind during composition, in addition to the fact that Romeo and Juliet are of wealthy families and would be more likely to marry earlier than commoners. At the time, English noblewomen married on average at 19\u201321 years (compared to 24\u201326 years for English noblemen) while the average marriage age in England was 25\u201326 years for women and 27\u201328 for men; Sir Thomas More wrote in his Utopia that, in Utopia, women must be at least 18 years of age when they marry and men at least 22 years."]}, {"page": "Richard Tottel", "response": ["*Arthur Brooke \u2013 The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet (1562)"]}, {"page": "The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet", "response": ["The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet is a narrative poem, first published in 1562 by Arthur Brooke, which was a key source for William Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet. Brooke is reported to have translated it from an Italian novella by Matteo Bandello; by another theory, it is mainly derived from a French adaptation of Bandello's novella which involves a man by the name of Reomeo Titensus and Juliet Bibleotet by Pierre Boaistuau, published by Richard Tottel.", "Little is known about Arthur Brooke.

Porter considers him to be \"a kind of ghost character\" like others in Shakespeare's plays, due to his strong connection with Mercutio that differentiates him from the other people mentioned in the guest list, and a possible significance to the plot and characters that is greater than superficially apparent. Shakespeare's immediate source in writing Romeo and Juliet was the narrative poem The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet (1562) by Arthur Brooke, and here Mercutio is a very minor character and is presented as a competitor to Romeus (Romeo) for Juliet's affection, rather than as his friend. Porter argues that when Shakespeare dramatised the poem and expanded Mercutio's role, he introduced a brother for him in order to suggest a more fraternal character. Shakespeare appears to be the first dramatist to have used the name Valentine prior to Romeo and Juliet, but he himself had actually used the name previously. In The Two Gentlemen of Verona, a play about two brothers and also set in Verona, Valentine is a true and constant lover and Proteus is a fickle one. While not primarily based on it, The Two Gentlemen of Verona adapts several incidents from Brooke's poem, and in all these instances Valentine's role is based on Romeus'. Thus, when adapting the Mercutio\u2014Juliet\u2014Romeus constellation from Brooke, by changing Mercutio from an amorous rival into a friend\u2014brother to Romeo and a \"scoffer at love\", Shakespeare also rearranged the relationships into Mercutio\u2014Romeo\u2014Juliet, making Romeo the focus and removing Mercutio as a threat to his courtship of Juliet."]}, {"page": "Touch Not the Cat", "response": ["Arthur Brooke's Romeus and Juliet - the poet's 1562 work that helped inspire Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet \u2013 this work is quoted from and is made part of the plot of the novel.

This story was reworked in 1524 by Luigi da Porto as Giulietta e Romeo (published posthumously in 1531). Da Porto named the character Romeo Montecchi and his storyline is near-identical to Shakespeare's adaptation. Since no 16th-century direct English translation of Giulietta e Romeo is known, Shakespeare's main source is thought to be Arthur Brooke's English verse translation of a French translation of a 1554 adaptation by Matteo Bandello. Although both Salernitano and da Porto claimed that their stories had historical basis, there is little evidence that this is the case."]}, {"page": "Shakespeare's writing style", "response": ["Shakespeare often borrowed plots from other plays and stories.  Hamlet, for example, is comparable to Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum. Romeo and Juliet is thought to be based on Arthur Brooke's narrative poem The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet. King Lear is based on the story of King Leir in Historia Regum Britanniae by Geoffrey of Monmouth, which was retold in 1587 by Raphael Holinshed. Borrowing plots in this way was not uncommon at the time.  After Shakespeare's death, playwrights quickly began borrowing from his works, a tradition that continues to this day."]}, {"page": "Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)", "response": ["The Nurse is a character in Arthur Brooke's poem The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, as Shakespeare's main source text. She is like family to the Capulets. The Nurse plays a similar role in the poem by Brooke, though she is less critical of Paris and is banished for the events that took place."]}, {"page": "Characters in Romeo and Juliet", "response": ["Valentine is Mercutio's brother, briefly mentioned as a guest at the Capulet feast where Romeo and Juliet meet. He is a ghost character with no speaking parts, and his only possible appearance is at the Capulet feast among the guests. \"Valentine\" has been taken to mean \"lover\" or \"brother\", and is associated with these attributes in several stories and histories. Scholars have pointed out that Valentine is more strongly connected to a major character than other ghosts, as he is given a direct connection to his brother. Although he has a very small role in Shakespeare's play, earlier versions of the story gave him no role or mention at all. In fact, they gave even Mercutio a very minor role. Shakespeare was the first English dramatist to use the name \"Valentine\" on stage, in his earlier plays, Titus Andronicus and The Two Gentlemen of Verona. In Titus, Valentine plays a minor role, but in Two Gentlemen, he is one of the title characters. Incidentally, the Valentine of Two Gentlemen borrows heavily from Arthur Brooke's Romeus in The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, which Shakespeare later used to create Romeo and Juliet. Brooke's version made Mercutio a rival for Juliet's love. Shakespeare's addition of Valentine as Mercutio's brother diffuses this rivalry. Thus, because the first time we hear of Mercutio he is associated with Valentine, rather than Juliet, he is changed from a rival to a friend and brotherly figure of Romeo.Porter, Joseph A. \"Mercutio's Brother.\" South Atlantic Review 49.4 (1984): 31\u201341."]}, {"page": "Arthur Brooke", "response": ["Arthur Brooke may refer to:", "*Arthur Brooke (poet) (died 1563), English poet", "*Sir Arthur Brooke, 1st Baronet (1726\u20131785), Irish MP for Fermanagh, 1761\u20131783, and Maryborough", "*Sir Arthur Brooke, 2nd Baronet (1797\u20131854), British MP for Fermanagh, 1840\u20131854", "*Arthur Brooke (entrepreneur) (1845\u20131918), British founder of The Brooke Bond Tea Company", "*Arthur Brooke (British Army officer) (1772\u20131843), Anglo-Irish lieutenant-general", "*Arthur Brooke Faulkner (1779\u20131845), Irish physician and author"]}, {"page": "1562 in poetry", "response": ["* Arthur Brooke, translation, The Tragicall History of Romeus and Juliet, a narrative poem, translated from the French version by Pierre Boaistuau (Paris, 1559) of Matteo Bandello's story, \"La sfortunata morte di dui infelicissimi manti\", from Bandello's Novelle, 1554; Brooke's work is considered to be William Shakespeare's chief source for his play Romeo and Juliet (1597)."]}, {"page": "1563 in poetry", "response": ["* March 19 \u2013 Arthur Brooke (born unknown), English poet whose only known work is The Tragicall History of Romeus and Juliet (1562), considered to be William Shakespeare's chief source for his famous play Romeo and Juliet"]}, {"page": "Thom Donovan", "response": ["Donovan released his third solo album, Canon, on June 17, 2014.
