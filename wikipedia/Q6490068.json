Having earned a first class degree in sculpture in 1977, and inspired by punk, psychedelia and krautrock, he returned to Blackpool and formed the band Section 25, along with his younger brother Vin on drums and Paul Wiggin on guitar. The band joined Factory Records in 1979 and Ian Curtis and Rob Gretton, Joy Division's singer and manager, respectively, produced their first single. Later producers included Martin Hannett, and Bernard Sumner of New Order.\nHe married Jenny Ross, who subsequently joined Section 25 in 1983, becoming his co-vocalist in the group. She died in 2004, just as the band were attempting a cautious reunion. Steered by Larry and Vin, Section 25 returned to live performance and recording in 2006, and three years later added Larry and Jenny's daughter, Bethany, whose voice recalls that of Jenny. However, Larry Cassidy died of a blood clot on 27 February 2010, at the age of 56.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Factory Records", "response": ["Colin Sharp, the Durutti Column singer during 1978 who took part in the A Factory Sample EP, died on 7 September 2009, after suffering a brain haemorrhage.

Initially the band was a duo, consisting of brothers Larry Cassidy (bass, vocals) and Vincent Cassidy (drums). In June 1978 they made their live debut with Phil Denton on guitar. Denton was replaced in November by Paul Wiggin. June 1979 saw the Cassidy brothers promote a charity gig in aid of International Year of the Child at Blackpool Imperial Hotel, featuring Section 25 and other local bands as well as Joy Division and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. As a result, Section 25 were invited to play at the Russell Club in Manchester, and joined Factory Records.", "Joined by percussionist Lee Shallcross, Section 25 gradually evolved with a more electronic-dance direction, a process which culminated in the album From the Hip and remix single \"Looking From A Hilltop\", both released in 1984 and produced by Bernard Sumner of New Order. This second version of the band also featured the Cassidy brothers' sister Angela Flowers (vocals, keyboards) and Larry Cassidy's wife Jenny Ross (vocals, keyboards). The five-piece completed a lengthy second tour of North America in January 1985, where the single \"Looking From A Hilltop\" achieved a measure of club success.", "Later in 1985 the single \"Crazy Wisdom\" emerged on Factory Benelux as a 12\", but the group again splintered, leaving husband-and-wife team Larry Cassidy and Jenny Ross to complete a fourth album, Love & Hate, finally released by Factory in 1988. Bad News Week was also released as a 12\" single, remixed by Bernard Sumner. Section 25 then fell silent for more than a decade, although their entire back catalogue was reissued on CD on LTM as well as an archive DVD, So Far.
