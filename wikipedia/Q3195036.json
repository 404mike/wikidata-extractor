He earned two England B caps in 1954, and was subsequently named in the full England squad which travelled to Switzerland for the 1954 FIFA World Cup.

A strong-tackling left-back, he joined Coventry City as an amateur while in the army but made no first-team appearances. In November 1952, he joined Birmingham City on a free transfer, and made his league debut the following season on 19 April 1954 in a Second Division game against Nottingham Forest at St Andrew's which ended 2\u20132. The form of established full-back pairing Ken Green and Jeff Hall meant Allen was unable to establish himself as a regular in the side, making only 30 appearances in his first seven years at the club. When Green sustained the injury which eventually forced his retirement, Allen took his place and kept it until suffering a fractured skull in 1961. On his recovery, he could not regain his place, mainly due to the form of Graham Sissons. After almost ten years at the club, and 166 games in all competitions, he joined Torquay United in January 1962, following in the footsteps of Birmingham teammate Gordon Astall who had made the same move six months earlier."]}, {"page": "Ken Green", "response": ["*Ken Green (golfer) (born 1958), American golfer", "*Ken Green (footballer, born 1929), English footballer (Grimsby Town)", "*Ken Green (footballer, born 1924) (1924\u20132001), English footballer (Birmingham City)", "*Ken Green (basketball, born 1959), American basketball player", "*Ken Greene (born 1956), American football"]}, {"page": "1956 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Now Sunderland found out how hard it is to score against this terrific defence of ours.

They went on to play on the losing side in two successive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup finals, under Smith's captaincy.
