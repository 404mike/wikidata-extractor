After an impressive start, scoring seven goals in his first twenty games, he attracted the attention of Liverpool FC's Bill Shankly who watched him in Scottish Cup action against Dumbarton on 28 February 1973 but didn't follow it up with a bid.He helped the club to the First Division title in season 1975-76. He signed for Celtic in September 1976 for \u00a360,000 where he won the Scottish Cup and League Championship in his first season. He moved to Blackburn Rovers in September 1978 where he remained until 1981 when he joined Hamilton Academical. He retired in 1983.\nWhilst at Celtic, he earned his only international cap against Sweden in April 1977. He started the match as a substitute and came on after 75 minutes and famously scored before having even kicked the ball, scoring a header just two minutes after replacing Kenny Burns.\nAfter his playing career, he managed Cowdenbeath for three years and later had coaching spells at Armadale Thistle and Airdrieonians. His son Steven is also a professional footballer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cowdenbeath F.C.", "response": ["* Joe Craig (1985\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 European Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Joe Craig"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Asa Hartford, Kenny Dalglish, Joe Craig"]}, {"page": "Sauchie Juniors F.C.", "response": ["Other former players include Joe Craig (Partick Thistle and Celtic), Jim Wallace (Dunfermline), and Paul McHale (Clyde and Dundee)."]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (1960\u20131979)", "response": ["|Asa Hartford, Kenny Dalglish, Joe Craig"]}, {"page": "List of Celtic F.C. international footballers", "response": ["*Joe Craig (1)"]}, {"page": "List of Hamilton Academical F.C. players", "response": ["|Joe Craig||||1981\u20131983||54||14||"]}, {"page": "List of Celtic F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Joe Craig"]}]}}
