Since her death in 1997, Burrell has been featured in the media in connection with her.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Diana, Princess of Wales", "response": ["Although she blamed Camilla Parker Bowles for her marital troubles, Diana began to believe her husband had also been involved in other affairs. In October 1993, Diana wrote to her butler Paul Burrell, telling him that she believed her husband was now in love with his personal assistant Tiggy Legge-Bourke\u2014who was also his sons' former nanny\u2014and was planning to have her killed \"to make the path clear for him to marry Tiggy\". Legge-Bourke had been hired by Charles as a young companion for his sons while they were in his care, and Diana was resentful of Legge-Bourke and her relationship with the young princes. Prince Charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby on 29 June 1994. In the interview, he said he had rekindled his relationship with Camilla in 1986 only after his marriage to Diana had \"irretrievably broken down\".", "After her 1996 divorce, Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of Kensington Palace that she had shared with Charles since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year. She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted \"to use the state apartments at St James's Palace\". In a book published in 2003, Paul Burrell claimed Diana's private letters had revealed that her brother, Lord Spencer, had refused to allow her to live at Althorp, despite her request. She was also given an allowance to run her private office, which was responsible for her charity work and royal duties, but from September 1996 onwards she was required to pay her bills and \"any expenditure\" incurred by her or on her behalf. Furthermore, she continued to have access to the jewellery that she had received during her marriage, and was allowed to use the air transport of the British royal family and government. Diana was also offered security by Metropolitan Police's Royalty Protection Group, which she benefitted from while travelling with her sons, but had refused it in the final years of her life, in an attempt to distance herself from the royal family.", "In addition to her will, Diana had also written a letter of wishes in which she had asked for three-quarters of her personal property to be given to her sons, and dividing the remaining quarter (aside from the jewellery) between her 17 godchildren. Despite Diana's wishes, the executors (her mother and sister) \"petitioned the probate court for a \"variance\" of the will\", and the letter of wishes was ignored \"because it did not contain certain language required by British law\". Eventually, one item from Diana's estate was given to each of her godchildren, while they would have received \u00a3100,000 each, had a quarter of her estate been divided between them. The variance also prevented the estate from being distributed between her sons at the age of 25 but postponed it until they were 30. Diana also left her butler Paul Burrell around \u00a350,000 in cash.", "Diana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals. She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Prince Charles in 1981 until her death in 1997, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\". She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage. Diana's former private secretary, Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", a viewpoint supported by biographer Tina Brown. He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\", but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\". Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\". Paul Burrell, who worked as a butler for Diana, remembered her as a \"deep thinker\" capable of \"introspective analysis\". She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life."]}, {"page": "Charles, Prince of Wales", "response": ["Described as the \"world's most eligible bachelor\" in the late 1970s, Prince Charles was subsequently overshadowed by Diana. After her death, the media regularly breached Charles's privacy and printed expos\u00e9s. In 2003, Diana's butler Paul Burrell published a note that he claimed had been written by Diana in 1995, in which there were allegations that Charles was \"planning 'an accident' in [Diana's] car, brake failure and serious head injury\" so that he could marry again. When questioned by the Metropolitan Police inquiry team as a part of Operation Paget, Charles told the authorities that he did not know about his former wife's note from 1995 and could not understand why she had these feelings."]}, {"page": "Burrell affair", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Burrell"]}, {"page": "Burrell scandal", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Burrell"]}, {"page": "Chesterfield, Derbyshire", "response": ["*Paul Burrell (born 1958), former royal butler and author"]}, {"page": "Farndon, Cheshire", "response": ["* Paul Burrell, former butler to Diana, Princess of Wales, maintained a home in the village and had a shop bearing his name, which he has since sold.
