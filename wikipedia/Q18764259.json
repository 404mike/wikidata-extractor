He was a contemporary of the French naturalist Alfred Grandidier and wrote detailed books about the flora and fauna of Madagascar, the country's general history, and the mission history on the island. He also helped revise the Malagasy Bible and wrote several works in the Malagasy language. He was a vocal advocate of Malagasy independence prior to the French invasion of Madagascar in 1895. Sibree also designed and helped build almost 100 new mission buildings and 50 churches in Madagascar. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and earned an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews. Swiss zoologist Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major named Sibree's dwarf lemur after him in 1896.\nSon of a Congregational minister, he apprenticed as a civil engineer before travelling to Antananarivo, Madagascar in 1863 on assignment from the London Missionary Society (LMS) to oversee the construction of four churches. After returning to England in 1867, he was ordained in 1870. He returned to Madagascar from 1870 to 1877, leaving again following difficulties with the Malagasy government. After spending a few years in England and South India, he returned to Madagascar again in 1883 and stayed until 1915. He died in 1929 due to a car accident. He and his wife had five children, four of which also become missionaries.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sakalava weaver", "response": ["The Sakalava weaver was first described by Gustav Hartlaub in 1861, based on a specimen collected by Victor Sganzin during an expedition in 1831\u201332 on Madagascar.

The first English name was given to the bird only in 1891 by James Sibree, who named it Sakalava Weaver-bird.

Literature searches by Dunkel et al. also uncovered other names, such as \"fork-lined lemur\" and \"squirrel lemur\", during the early 1900s. By the 1970s, reference to dwarf and mouse lemurs had ended, and the \"fork-crowned\" prefix became popular between 1960 and 2001. Since then, the \"fork-marked\" prefix has become more widely used. These lemurs get their common name from the distinctive forked stripe on their head."]}, {"page": "Sibree's dwarf lemur", "response": ["The name of this dwarf lemur commemorates the English missionary and naturalist James Sibree (1836\u20131929)."]}, {"page": "Sibree", "response": ["* James Sibree (1836\u20131929), English missionary in Madagascar"]}, {"page": "Sibree, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Sibree"]}, {"page": "William Deans Cowan", "response": ["*James Sibree"]}]}}
