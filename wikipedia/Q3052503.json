On 23 November McNaughton was sent to have a scan on the back injury, which the club's medical staff believed to have caused the problem and resulted in him being out for two weeks. On 5 December 2009 McNaughton played his first 90 minutes of the season in a 1\u20130 win over Preston North End. The next season his injury worries ceded and he has played in every league up to and including the game against Barnsley.

After talking with his family and the club, he then decided to stay for the remainder of his contract. On 23 January 2017, he signed an extension to his contract, keeping him at the club for a further two years, until summer 2019. Davies courted controversy when he received a red card for stamping on Celtic captain Scott Brown during a 3\u20130 defeat at Celtic Park in March 2018.

He then scored his first goal on 14 September 2010 against Leicester City, after a cross floated into the back of the net. Naylor scored his second goal, against Leeds United, from 25 yards. Naylor was selected less during Cardiff's poor run of the season, in November and December, and eventually dropped for the Swansea City game at Liberty Stadium. Due to the signing of Jlloyd Samuel, Naylor became a last choice left back behind McNaughton and Darcy Blake. On 9 April, Naylor returned to playing, coming on as a half time substitute for Blake, against Doncaster Rovers, then again came on against Sheffield United.

A goal by Sone Aluko handed Aberdeen their first home win of the season, and more importantly, all three points. The following week Aberdeen travelled to Dundee to face Dundee United for the second New Firm Derby of the season. It got off to another bad start for the Dons, Francisco Sandaza scored the opening goal in the opening 8 minutes, Northern-Irish striker Warren Feeney doubled the 'tangerine's' advantage on 14 minutes. Aberdeen pulled a goal back through Darren Mackie, but it proved to only be a consolation goal, as the Dons' lost the derby 2\u20131, although they had a goal disallowed for offside. The Dons' then hosted St Mirren in a midweek match at Pittodrie. Both the goals in the 2\u20130 win were scored in the last 10 minutes, First defender Andrew Considine finished well after good work by Mark Kerr then Englishman Sone Aluko was put clean-through on goal to score the second. The win propelled Aberdeen up to fourth in the league for the first time. Aberdeen then played Hibernian in their second trip to the capital. The Dons opened the scoring just before half-time when Darren Mackie pounced on Rob Jones' error to head the visitors in front, four minutes before half-time. Aberdeen doubled their lead eight minutes after the break when Sone Aluko flighted in a corner and Zander Diamond headed in his first goal of the season and put the Dons' 2\u20130 up. Three points turned into one point as Rob Jones made amends for his first half error and pulled one back for Hibs with a header in the 62nd minute, and with virtually the last kick of the game Steven Fletcher scrambled in a goal. Aberdeen then travelled to Glasgow to play Rangers at Ibrox. Aberdeen dominated the first half and it took a good save from Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor to prevent Derek Young from scoring the opening goal. The Dons' continued to hold the upper hand until Jean-Claude Darcheville bundled the ball over the line to put Rangers 1\u20130 up. Zander Diamond was unlucky not to level when his header was cleared off the line by Pedro Mendes. Seconds later Rangers had the ball in the net again, this time through Kris Boyd. The game finished 2\u20130 to Rangers. Aberdeen then hosted Motherwell at Pittodrie. Motherwell keeper Graeme Smith pulled off a fantastic save to prevent Darren Mackie from opening the scoring. However, on the hour mark, just seconds after coming on as a second-half substitute Gary McDonald headed the Dons' in front after fine work from Sone Aluko. It was 2\u20130 eight six minutes later, when Jeffrey de Visscher whipped in a cross, only for Darren Mackie to be hauled down by Motherwell defender Paul Quinn. Referee Chris Boyle showed a red card to Quinn for his last man challenge, and awarded a penalty to the Dons', which Lee Miller happily dispatched. The game finished 2\u20130 and moved the Dons' up to fifth in the table."]}, {"page": "2005 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||19|| Paul Quinn|| || "]}, {"page": "Coltness High School", "response": ["* Paul Quinn, footballer"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["|Paul Quinn", "||| DF|| 2 ||Paul Quinn"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["|Paul Quinn", "| 14 || DF || Paul Quinn || 8 || 0"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Football League Championship", "response": ["**Cardiff City 2\u20133 Leicester City \u2013 3 for Cardiff City (Paul Quinn, Mark Hudson, Stephen McPhail) and 6 for Leicester City (Alex Bruce, Nolberto Solano, Andy King, Lloyd Dyer, Richie Wellens, Steve Howard) (11 May 2010)"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["|  Paul Quinn"]}, {"page": "Adam Matthews", "response": ["He went on to make his professional debut at the start of the 2009\u201310 season when he replaced Paul Quinn during a 1\u20131 draw with Blackpool on 15 August.
