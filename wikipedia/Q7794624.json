In February 1809 one Thomas Windeatt, from Bridgetown, Totnes, took over the lease of a plot of land (a \"newtake\") of about 582 acres in the valley of the River Swincombe. In 1812 Windeatt started to build a farmhouse, Fox Tor Farm, on his land and his workmen robbed the nearby Childe's Tomb of most of its stones for the building and its doorsteps.Stanbrook (1994) p. 42\u20133"]}, {"page": "Princetown", "response": ["The village has its origins in 1785, when Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, Secretary to the Prince of Wales, leased a large area of moorland from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, hoping to convert it into good farmland.

He called the settlement Princetown after the Prince of Wales.", "In 1780, a farm was reclaimed on the site of an ancient tenement near the Two Bridges, and in 1785, Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt set about improving the moor at a place which he named Tor Royal (present day Tor Royal Farm), about  south-east of Princetown. The Plume of Feathers Inn also bears this date on its sign. He made an estate and built a house in 1798.

Tyrwhitt wished to improve agriculture and extractive industries on Dartmoor, and he conceived the idea of a railway to connect Princetown and Plymouth. This was to bring lime and sea-sand up to the Moor for the improvement of land, together with timber and coal. Granite, peat, mineral products and agricultural produce would be carried down.
