There, it was recognised as potentially a van Dyck by presenter Fiona Bruce, who had been working with art historian Philip Mould on an episode of another BBC programme (Fake or Fortune?), which recently featured works by van Dyck. Mould shared her suspicions and suggested that the work be treated by an expert restorer, in what he described as \"the art equivalent of an [archaeological] excavation\". The painting was restored by Simon Gillespie, who used solvent to remove layers of overpainting, in a process that took the equivalent of three weeks of full-time work. The removal of later painting returned what had appeared to be a finished portrait into a sketch with unfinished details. The ruff in particular was shown only in outline.
