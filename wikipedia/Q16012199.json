In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch.Reid, p. 202 The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members.Morrison, p. 79 The principals included Paul Beard, George Stratton, Anthony Pini, Gerald Jackson, L\u00e9on Goossens, Reginald Kell, James Bradshaw and Marie Goossens.Russell, p. 135"]}, {"page": "London Philharmonic Orchestra", "response": ["During his earlier negotiations with the BBC Beecham had proposed the title \"London Philharmonic Orchestra\",Kenyon, pp.\u00a020\u201322 which was now adopted for the new ensemble.

Beard was based in London, England. The organization was devoted to finding in spiritualism evidence of life after death. During his tenure as a member and president Beard wrote an article that was published in Spiritual Frontiers in 1970 on \"How to Guard Against Possession.\" During this research he experimented extensively with using an ouija board.  In his role as President of CPS, he lectured and mentored many aspiring students in the art of spiritualism."]}, {"page": "Philharmonia Quartet", "response": ["The gathering of these four very distinguished musicians resulted in some of the most dynamic chamber concertizing immediately at the end of the war. Henry Holst (b. 1899), a pupil of Axel Gade, had been leader of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra from 1923 to 1931. By 1931, Herbert Downes (1909-2004), a student of Paul Beard and Carl Flesch, held the viola desk in the Henry Holst Quartet.  In 1935, Downes was leading his own quartet. Anthony Pini (1902-1989) had recorded the Schubert C major Quintet and the Brahms B flat major Sextet (No. 1) with the Pro Arte Quartet (for HMV) during the 1930s. In 1940 Herbert Downes moved to the BBC Scottish Orchestra and from there to the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and from 1945-1974 became principal viola of the Philharmonia Orchestra. Henry Holst and Anthony Pini were together with Louis Kentner in a 1941 Columbia Records account of the Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Dumky Trio, and again with Solomon in the Beethoven Archduke Trio in 1943. The Philharmonia Quartet was performing at Manchester in 1945 (the year in which Holst began teaching at the Royal College of Music). It gave the premiere of the William Walton A minor Quartet at the Prague Spring Festival in 1947, and thereafter repeated it at home (e.g. Aberdeen Chamber Society, February 1948). Its performance in the Brahms F minor Quintet with Clifford Curzon was considered 'exhilarating'. Its 1945 Columbia Records 78rpm recording of the Mozart clarinet quintet with Reginald Kell (the earlier of Kell's versions) was highly praised."]}, {"page": "William Henry Reed", "response": ["W. H. Reed had ceased to be the leader of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1935, although he still assumed that role on certain special occasions.

He had also taught at the Royal College of Music throughout his performing career and was made a Fellow of the college.

In addition to those established choirs, the Royal School of Church Music conducted auditions to find twenty boy trebles from parish church choirs representing the various regions of the United Kingdom. Along with twelve trebles chosen from various British cathedral choirs, the selected boys spent the month beforehand training at Addington Palace. The final complement of choristers comprised 182 boy trebles, 37 male altos, 62 tenors and 67 basses. The orchestra, of 60 players, was drawn from the leading members of British symphony orchestras and chamber ensembles. Each of the 18 violinists, headed by Paul Beard, was the leader of a major orchestra or chamber group.
