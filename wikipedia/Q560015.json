Helen Bannerman's The Story of Little Black Sambo and Florence Kate Upton's The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg have also been noted for their racist and controversial depictions. The term sambo, a racial slur from the American South caused a widespread banning of Bannerman's book. Author Julius Lester and illustrator Jerry Pinkney revised the story as Sam and the Tigers: A New Telling of Little Black Sambo, making its content more appropriate and empowering for ethnic minority children. Feminist theologian Dr. Eske Wollrad claimed Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking novels \"have colonial racist stereotypes\", urging parents to skip specific offensive passages when reading to their children. Criticisms of the 1911 novel The Secret Garden by author Frances Hodgson Burnett claim endorsement of racist attitudes toward black people through the dialogue of main character Mary Lennox.

Decades later, Walt Disney had sought to obtain the rights to make a film adaptation of the novels. The Disney studios wanted Lofting to surrender the ancillary rights in exchange for a flat fee of $7,500, but a suitable contract reached an impasse. In 1960, Lofting's widow Josephine gave a short-term option of the film rights to Helen Winston, a Canadian actress who had produced the film Hand in Hand (1960). In April 1962, 20th Century Fox signed a multi-picture production deal with Winston's company, Luster Enterprises, with plans to commence production in the following months.
