Both systems depend on the gravitational acceleration, and use the pound-force as the unit of force but use different approaches when applying Newton's laws of motion. In the BG system, force, rather than mass has a base unit while the slug is a derived unit of inertia (rather than mass). On the other hand, the EE system uses a different approach and introduces the acceleration due to gravity (g) into its equations.  Both these approaches led to slight variations in the meaning of the pound-force (and also of the kilogram-force) in different parts of the world.  Various countries published standard values that should be used for g, and in 1901 the CGPM published a standard value for g that should be used in the \"International Service of Weights and Measures\", namely , which is equal to the value of g at 45\u00b0 latitude."]}, {"page": "1902 Coronation Honours", "response": ["*Arthur Mason Worthington, Esq., FRS, MA"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1893", "response": ["# Arthur Mason Worthington (1852\u20131916)"]}]}}
