He is currently manager of Hamworthy United.\nSills was a product of Millwall's youth system and was a regular in the club's youth team up until he left in 1997. He then joined part-time outfit Camberley Town, spending a year and a half at the club, before moving to Basingstoke Town towards the end of the 1998\u201399 season. Sills spent three seasons with Basingstoke, playing over 100 games for the club. During his time at the club, he was loaned out twice; to Staines Town and Kingstonian respectively \u2013 joining the latter permanently ahead of the club's 2002\u201303 campaign. After a successful first season at Kingstonian, he joined Aldershot Town in order to ply his trade in the highest tier of non-league football. He spent two and a half years with the Hampshire club, scoring regularly, before signing for Football League side Oxford United in January 2006 for \u00a350,000. He struggled for first-team appearances, as well as goals, and was released at the end of the season.\nSills subsequently joined Hereford United in June 2006 and spent one season at the club before being released. At the start of the 2007\u201308 season he signed for Torquay United, and scored in the game that earned Torquay promotion to the Football League a year later. He struggled for games during the 2009\u201310 season as manager Paul Buckle went about reshaping his squad mid-season and Sills was deemed surplus to requirements at Plainmoor. He signed for Hertfordshire side Stevenage in January 2010 for an undisclosed fee, playing an important part in the club's end of season run, as Stevenage won promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history.
