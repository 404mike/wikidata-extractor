Three days later, on 9 April, Stevenage welcomed Preston North End to Broadhall Way, signalling the return of former manager Graham Westley, who left Stevenage in January 2012 to take up the vacant position at Deepdale. The game ended 1\u20131, stretching Stevenage's winless run to seven league games. Preston took the lead with just four minutes remaining, with substitute Iain Hume sliding the ball in from six yards out following Danny Mayor's through ball. Stevenage then equalised in the fourth minute of injury time, with captain Mark Roberts heading in Michael Bostwick's floated cross to ensure a share of the spoils. The result meant that Stevenage were in ninth position, six points away from the final play-off place with just six games remaining. Stevenage travelled to in-form Yeovil Town five days after the draw with Preston, looking to secure a first away win in just under two months. Stevenage won the match 6\u20130, recording their biggest Football League victory to date, as well as recording the joint biggest away victory of 2011\u201312 League One campaign. Stevenage took an early lead in the match when Patrick Agyemang was played into the area by Craig Reid, Agyemang then squared the ball across goal for Luke Freeman to score from close range. Yeovil were reduced to ten men when Michael Woods fouled Michael Bostwick. Agyemang scored Stevenage's second goal when he collected Jamaal Lascelles long pass, before calmly beating Sam Walker in the Yeovil goal. Two goals within the space of three second half minutes put the game beyond doubt, with Jon Ashton and Lascelles scoring headers from set pieces. Mark Roberts added a fifth goal with ten minutes remaining \u2014 prodding in Freeman's centre. Freeman then scored his second, and Stevenage's sixth, when Jordan Slew made room down the right wing after a neat interchange with Agyemang, before finding Freeman at the back post to tap in from six yards out. The club then welcomed play-off rivals Carlisle United to Broadhall Way, knowing that a defeat would virtually end the club's play-off hopes. Stevenage dominated the first-half, but were unable to take an advantage into the interval. The second half was a much more even affair, with both teams spurning goalscoring opportunities. The deadlock was broken with just fifteen minutes remaining, substitute John Mousinho, returning from a six-month injury lay-off, latched onto Stacy Long's chipped through ball, before crashing the ball into the goal off the crossbar. Four days later, on 21 April, Stevenage hosted another team hoping to snatch the final play-off place when Brentford travelled to Broadhall Way. Stevenage secured a 2\u20131 victory, consequently ending Brentford's play-off hopes in the process. The visitors had the opportunity to take the lead on the half hour mark when Jamaal Lascelles was adjudged to have pushed Clinton Morrison in the area. However, Clayton Donaldson's penalty rebounded off the crossbar and Stevenage were able to clear to ensure the teams went in level at half-time. Brentford were then handed another chance from the penalty spot five minutes after the interval, this time the referee deemed Jon Ashton to have fouled Morrison. Brentford's Sam Saunders stepped up and his powerful penalty rebounded off the post and into the arms of Chris Day. Just three minutes after the second penalty miss, Stevenage were one goal to the good. Craig Reid controlled Lawrie Wilson's low cross, before hitting a shot on the turn that bounced off the ground and past Brentford goalkeeper Simon Moore. Luke Freeman then doubled Stevenage's advantage ten minutes later, dispossessing Adam Thompson before cutting in and hitting a right-footed shot that crashed into the goal off the post. Saunders reduced the deficit in injury-time with a curling free-kick, although Stevenage held on to secure a vital victory. The third straight victory, coupled with Notts County's home loss to Bury, meant that Stevenage were back in the play-off places with just two games remaining. Stevenage then travelled to Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United in a game that was televised live on Sky Sports on 28 April, and attracted a crowd of over 30,000 spectators. The game was an evening kick-off, meaning Stevenage had moved down to seventh in the league table as a result of Notts County's 4\u20133 win at Wycombe Wanderers earlier in the day. The game ended 2\u20132, with Stevenage taking a two-goal lead through strikes from Joel Byrom and Scott Laird, before Sheffield United's Richard Cresswell and Matthew Lowton restored parity. The draw meant that Stevenage had regained their place in sixth with just one game remaining.", "As a result of Stevenage finishing sixth in the league, they faced third placed Sheffield United over two legs in the League One play-off semi-finals. Due to Sheffield United's higher standing in the league table, Stevenage had home advantage in the first leg, with the game being played on 11 May 2012, televised live on Sky Sports. The game was a tight affair with very little chances, ending in a 0\u20130 draw. The only chance of note during the game was Craig Reid's looping effort that beat Steve Simonsen in the Sheffield United goal, but rebounded off the crossbar. The second leg, played at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane, took place on 14 May, and was again a televised match. Similarly to the first leg, the game was a close encounter, with very little chances in the first-half. Sheffield United took the lead with just five minutes remaining, Chris Porter heading in Matthew Lowton's right wing cross to give the home side a 1\u20130 lead. Stevenage had little time to reply, and they ultimately bowed out at the semi-final stage of the play-offs in their first ever League One campaign."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["Despite their form, United suffered a catastrophic start to March as they lost at home to Oldham Athletic having had a two-goal lead only to see both Matthew Lowton and Harry Maguire sent off and the team subsequently collapse.  With the entire back four unavailable, United were forced to draft in Matt Hill and John Egan on emergency loans, but this was not enough to prevent them slipping to their third defeat in four games as they capitulated at Walsall.  Danny Wilson remained keen to find first team experience for the younger members of the squad and as such allowed Seamus Conneely to join Alfreton Town on loan before United returned to winning ways with two goals from Ched Evans being enough to defeat Brentford at Griffin Park.  Unfortunately the Blades failed to take advantage of their game in hand, being held to a draw by Colchester United, before once again allowing a lead to slip as they drew with Tranmere Rovers at Bramall Lane. With the transfer deadline for loans approaching, the Blades' longest serving player and vice-captain Nick Montgomery was allowed to join Millwall until the end of the season due to an absence of first team football, allowing Danny Wilson to bring in winger Michael O'Halloran on loan from Bolton Wanderers.  Meanwhile, on the pitch, United put their recent poor form behind them as they outclassed Notts County 5\u20132 at Meadow Lane, before putting four goals past Chesterfield at Bramall Lane, including a hat\u2013trick from in\u2013form striker Ched Evans.  Despite a low\u2013key team performance, a second Ched Evans penalty in as many games was enough to finish the month with a third straight victory, with the Blades defeating Hartlepool United at Victoria Park.", "|Matthew Lowton", "|Matthew Lowton", "* 19/20 November: Matthew Lowton", "* 25/26 November: Matthew Lowton", "* 10/11 December: Ched Evans, Matthew Lowton", "* 11/12 February: Ched Evans, Matthew Lowton, Kevin McDonald"]}]}}
