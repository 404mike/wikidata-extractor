He hailed from a long line of English instrument makers and transformed the family business from one dealing in nautical instruments to one specialising in scientific instruments. Browning was particularly well known for his advances in the fields of spectroscopy, astronomy, and optometry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Optical Association", "response": ["At a meeting called by Mr Robert Sutcliffe, a sight-testing optician of Rochdale, the BOA was formed and elected the distinguished London optician John Browning (scientific instrument maker) as its first President. The BOA ran the first professional examinations in optics in 1896 and campaigned over many years for the state recognition of the profession, finally achieving success in 1958 with the passing of the Opticians Act by Parliament. It operated a number of local associations across the UK and was responsible for establishing the Army Spectacle Depot during World War I and establishing the Joint Council of Qualified Opticians (JCQO) together with the Institute of Ophthalmic Opticians (IOO) in 1922. The BOA also provided the Secretariat for a number of other optical bodies including what would eventually become the Association of Optometrists and the International Optometric and Optical League (IOOL), known since 1995 as the World Council of Optometry."]}, {"page": "John Browning (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Browning (1855\u20131926) was an American weapon designer.", "John Browning may also refer to:", "*John Browning (American football) (born 1973), American football player", "*John Browning (footballer, born 1888) (1888\u20131964), Scottish footballer (Celtic)", "*John Browning (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20131971), Scottish footballer (Liverpool)", "*John Browning (died 1416) (c. 1369\u20131416), MP for Gloucestershire 1397, 1401 and 1414", "*John Browning (pianist) (1933\u20132003), American pianist", "*John Browning (scientific instrument maker) (c. 1831\u20131925), English scientific instrument maker"]}, {"page": "List of aviation pioneers", "response": ["|The first scientist to deduce the main properties of cambered aerofoil.Francis/Windrow 1970, p.11 Built gliders and with John Browning the world's first wind tunnel in 1871."]}, {"page": "Francis Herbert Wenham", "response": ["In 1871 Wenham and colleague John Browning designed and constructed what was probably the world's first wind tunnel.

He ground and silvered (to a method expounded by John Browning) the mirror himself, and cast and turned the mount and all the mechanism, all in brass of course. In 1895 he demonstrated projection of stereoscopic images using red and green filters on the two oxy-hydrogen projectors. The following year he demonstrated X-ray photography in conjunction with Professor W. H. Bragg. He experimented with the \"audiphone\", by which some deaf persons were able to hear by amplified sound being transmitted through the teeth."]}]}}
