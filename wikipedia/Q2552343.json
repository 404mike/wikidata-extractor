In 2019, the studio was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment, becoming a part of PlayStation Studios.", "The company's first project was Disruptor, for PlayStation, whose poor sales almost led to the company's bankruptcy. Insomniac's next project was Spyro the Dragon, a successful video game that spawned two sequels within two years. Insomniac closely collaborated with Sony Computer Entertainment (later renamed Sony Interactive Entertainment) and created two game franchises, Ratchet & Clank, and Resistance. The two franchises proved to be both a critical and financial success for the company. The company began work on its first multiplatform game Fuse in 2013 (with Electronic Arts as its publisher), but the game turned out to become one of Insomniac's worst-reviewed games.", "Since 2014, Insomniac has actively expanded its portfolio of games. The company worked with Microsoft Studios on 2014's Sunset Overdrive, partnered with GameTrust to release the underwater Metroidvania game Song of the Deep, and released several mobile games and virtual reality projects. In 2016, Insomniac released a re-imagining of the first Ratchet & Clank, and in 2018 released its first licensed title, Marvel's Spider-Man for the PlayStation 4; an additional game, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, was released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 in 2020. The studio's most recent project is Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart which released exclusively for the PlayStation 5 in June 2021.

The game originally revolved around a reptilian alien with weapons traveling across planets. The reptile character evolved into a caveman, and eventually became a fictional creature called a \"Lombax\". They named the creature Ratchet and designed a robot companion called Clank for Ratchet. Inspirations for the game were drawn from manga, Conker's Bad Fur Day and from Spyro the Dragon. To differentiate the project from Insomniac's previous projects, they made the game more complex and included shooting and role-playing gameplay elements. The team was excited about this project; however, the company was unable to develop a demo for the game because it did not have a suitable engine. As a result, they developed \"Art Nuevo de Flash Gordon\", a Metropolis diorama, for Sony, which decided to help the game's funding and publishing. Jason Rubin, on behalf of Naughty Dog, lent Insomniac the engine used in Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy. The game's title was Ratchet & Clank; it was originally to be a launch title for the PlayStation 2 but it was delayed by two years and was released in November 2002. It was a critical success.", "Five months before the launch of Ratchet & Clank, Sony approved the development of its sequel. Insomniac hoped to bring new elements to the franchise; it received feedback from players and improved some features of Ratchet & Clank. About a year later, Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando was released to critical acclaim, at which time Insomniac had finished the prototype of their next game, Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal, which introduced a multiplayer mode and expanded upon Going Commandos arenas. Alex Hastings continued to optimize the engine and increase its processing power to fine-tune the game. The sales of Up Your Arsenal were considerably higher than those of its predecessors; it was the highest-rated game in the franchise's history.", "Insomniac released three Ratchet & Clank game within three years. As of 2005, Insomniac intended to change the direction of the franchise after Up Your Arsenal. Hastings hoped the company's next game would have a darker tone than its predecessors. As a result, the plot switched its focus to Ratchet. The developers were inspired by The Running Man and Battle Royale; they developed an action game with no platform elements. While the gameplay of the fourth game in the series is similar to that of its predecessors, Clank's role was significantly diminished and the character's name was removed from the game's title. Ratchet: Deadlocked was released in 2005.", "While Insomniac was handling the development of the Ratchet & Clank franchise, the team wanted to work on something else. With the launch of the PlayStation 3, the team thought users of the new console would be more mature than those of its predecessors and wanted to develop a game to cater for them. They thought the studio should not specialize in one genre. This new project was part of Insomniac's expansion; the company wanted to have multiple projects in parallel development. This project began development after the completion of Deadlocked. The team agreed to develop something different for a different platform. Inspired by Starship Troopers, Resistance: Fall of Man was Insomniac's first first-person shooter after Disruptor. To make the game stand-out, they experimented with turning it into a squad-based shooter and introducing giant lizard enemies which were later scrapped. Sony recommended Insomniac to change its lizard antagonist because they were not fun to play with. Furthermore, the team disagreed about the game's setting.", "Meanwhile, development of the Ratchet & Clank franchise continued. The team decided to rewrite the characters when the franchise shifted to the PlayStation 3. They introduced the Future series, which includes Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction (2007), Quest for Booty (2008) and A Crack in Time (2009). In 2008, the company established a new studio of 25 to 30 developers, led by Chad Dezern and Shaun McCabe, in North Carolina. The new studio was responsible for some of Insomniac's Ratchet & Clank games.", "Both the Resistance franchise and the Ratchet & Clank franchise continued into the 2010s. The team in North Carolina developed Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One, which received mixed reviews. The North Carolina team continued to develop the next game in the series, Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault, which expanded upon levels from previous games in the series and has a structure similar to that of a tower defense game.", "The EA Partners game was revealed at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 as Overstrike. This game was pitched by Ratchet & Clank director Brian Allgeier and it has a direction similar to that of the Ratchet & Clank series. The team thought Overstrike would appeal to teenagers. After several play-testing sessions, they realized their game was too simple for their target group. The company developed many weapons for the game, none of which related to the game's story. The developers retooled the game and changed it to attract older players and make weapons an important part of the game. The game focuses on a co-operative campaign, which the company thought was a popular trend at that time. It was renamed Fuse and was released worldwide in May 2013. Fuse was one of the lowest-rated games developed by Insomniac, and was another commercial failure, debuting in 37th place in the UK in its first week of release. Fuse was considered a learning lesson for Insomniac to understand the type of game they are good at making. The reception to Fuse showed the company it should develop \"colorful, playful experiences that's loaded with unusual, sometimes silly weapons\".

The company said that part of their rebranding was to \"think beyond the moon\". Insomniac chief brand officer Ryan Schneider said part of the rebranding was to prevent the studio being pigeonholed; while the moon-based logo had well-represented the company for its Spyro and Ratchet & Clank cartoon-like games, it did not reflect well on the expanded directions they had moved in recent years, such as the Spider-Man game. Schneider said that along with the brand change, the company plans to be engaging with players, offering live-streaming of their work, and re-establishing a new identity, without completely eschewing their past.

Arranging a meeting to reclaim the experiment, Fizzwidget \"accidentally\" maroons the duo on a desert planet, whereupon after escaping from a network of caves, the pair are confronted by the thief, who accidentally exposes \"his\" true identity: a female Lombax named Angela Cross (Kath Soucie), who used to work for Megacorp as a scientist. Claiming that the experiment is a threat to the entire galaxy, Angela gives them the location of a testing facility on planet Dobbo where it was created and advises them to seek out the proof that backs up her story. Following her lead, the duo infiltrate the facility and discover a video recording that reveals the experiment to be highly dangerous and capable of going into a violent rampage. Shortly afterwards, Angela contacts the pair and reveals that MegaCorp has duplicated the experiment and intends to sell them as a new product called the \"Protopet\".", "Convinced that Fizzwidget is unaware of the Protopet's flaws, Ratchet goes to warn him during a promotionary event being held on planet Boldan, only to discover it to be a trap by the Thugs-4-Less boss (Steven Blum), after cancelling their contract with Angela to work with MegaCorp.

These are the things we think will really grab people's attention and give the game that Wow-Factor. In the case of Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando the big ideas were RPG elements (like weapon upgrades and health upgrades), spherical planets and space combat.\" Hastings said that the inspiration for the game's spherical worlds came in part from the cover of the 1943 novel The Little Prince. Designing the spherical worlds required changing about 50,000 lines of the game's code, to account for the different handling of gravity. Development took a total of ten months, during which time Insomniac's design team doubled from 40 to 80 members.", "One common criticism of the original Ratchet & Clank was the design and personality of Ratchet.

Originally an organic humanoid with an abnormally-large head, Dr. Nefarious first appeared in a comic where, angry and embittered against those who had belittled him for his deformed appearance, he created an army of mutant Amoeboids to infest and destroy Blackwater City on planet Rilgar. After fending off the Amoeboids, superhero Captain Qwark traced Nefarious to a secret robot factory on planet Magmos and confronted the villain. Upon meeting him, Qwark recognized Nefarious as one of the students he bullied and humiliated in high school. Qwark then attempted to give Nefarious a wedgie \"for old times' sake\", but instead accidentally knocked the doctor off a catwalk and into the machinery below, which ultimately led to his transformation into a robot. Driven insane by the experience, Nefarious soon resurfaced and unleashed a swarm of robotic insects on the city of Metropolis on planet Kerwan to get revenge on Qwark, who confronted and defeated him again; Nefarious' body was badly damaged and all that was left of the villain was his disembodied head, which Qwark dumped in a trash can intending to get rid of him for good. Qwark was subsequently knocked out by Nefarious' butler, Lawrence, and taken to the former's ice planet lab. Qwark managed to escape while Nefarious began planning his vendetta while his body was repaired; however, the hasty repairs left Nefarious with a habit of malfunctioning in times of extreme stress (during which he freezes up and receives random radio signals of a holo-vision soap opera series, Lance and Janice, in his head) until being whacked by Lawrence or any of his allies.", "While Nefarious is neither seen nor mentioned, his Amoeboids appear in Blackwater City on Rilgar in the original Ratchet & Clank.

He then started a campaign to exterminate all organic lifeforms in the Solana Galaxy planet by planet. Nefarious then creates and unleashes the \"Biobliterator\", a superweapon that turns all organic lifeforms into robots so that he can unify the galaxy under his \"benevolent, iron-fisted rule\" and usher in the new \"Age of Robots\". He also attempts to convince Clank to join his cause, being a big fan of the small robot's appearances in the \"Secret Agent Clank\" holo-vision show, of which he owns a copy of every episode as he mistakingly believes that the show is real.

The duo travel to planet Koros and destroys the first Biobliterator with an ion cannon. Nefarious then reveals he has a secondary Biobliterator ready and waiting on planet Mylon; this one is capable of transforming into giant robot which Nefarious himself pilots. Ratchet and Clank manage to destroy it with the aid of Captain Qwark, forcing Nefarious and Lawrence to teleport away to safety.

Nefarious uses his trust with the Fongoids to have them build a fortress for himself, then summons and traps the creator of the Great Clock, Orvus, to extract information from him regarding the Clock's operation.

After Clank opens the Orvus Chamber, Lawrence knocks him out and reports the news to Nefarious.

With \"help\" from Captain Qwark, Ratchet and Clank reunite and infiltrate Nefarious' space station to destroy his fleet of ships, but are then captured and brought before Nefarious. After explaining the full extent of his plans, Nefarious ejects the two heroes with his \"Asteroid Flinger 5000\" (installed in the case that he needs an ironic death scenario for his enemies). After surviving a crash landing on planet Morklon and going back in time to help the Fongoids win the Battle of Gimlick Valley, Ratchet and Clank commandeer a ship back to the space station and stop Nefarious from boarding his last remaining ship to the Great Clock. In the end, Dr. Nefarious is again defeated by Ratchet and Clank and falls screaming to his ship's surface. Upon landing, he suffers a complete system breakdown (characterized by random music signals and dancing) before his ship crashes into the space station and destroys it.

Here, he is depicted in an organic form, having not yet undergone his robotic conversion, acting as Chairman Drek's chief scientist. Instead of appearing as he did in Up Your Arsenal before turning into a robot, Doctor Nefarious has green skin with pointy ears, wears glasses, and physically resembles his later robot form. It is stated in the film that Nefarious was originally a founding member of the Galactic Rangers before he turned evil, working as the Rangers' support team before Elaris; he turned to villainy out of anger for Qwark taking all the credit for Nefarious' work and inventions and refusing to treat him as an equal. It is also stated that Nefarious' first major crime was an attempt to \"atomize\" Aleero City, resulting in Qwark defeating and incarcerating him before the doctor is presumably killed in a failed prison break. Nefarious subsequently partners with Drek to create a superweapon known as the \"Deplanitizer\" to enable Drek to destroy other planets and harvest suitable remains for the creation of a new planet to replace his own over-polluted homeworld. Nefarious ensured that the target list included Umbris, an uninhabited planet with a core of pure moluvium that he knew would detonate once struck by the Deplanetizer, resulting in the Solana system being completely wiped out due to a rare orbital convergence and, Nefarious hoped, resulting in the Rangers being forcibly disbanded and ruined for failing to prevent the disaster. To ensure the success of his plans, he turns Drek into a sheep using the Sheepinator, one of his favorite weapons, and assuming direct control of the Deplanetizer. Nefarious also creates a weapon nicknamed the RYNO (Rip You a New One), the most powerful weapon in the galaxy, which causes him to be struck by an energy blast when Ratchet hits him near the end of the film, causing him to plummet to his death. In a post-credits scene, Nefarious is shown to have survived the fall, albeit with near-fatal injuries, before a few repairbots searching the Deplanetizer's wreckage for survivors find and convert him into a robot to save his life.

With the PlayStation 2 recently announced in 2000, Insomniac began to prototype ideas for games on this new console. One, called Monster Knight, never got past the prototyping stage, while a second, called Girl with a Stick and aimed to be a mashup of The Legend of Zelda and Tomb Raider series, had about six months of development work before Insomniac's CEO, Ted Price, decided to cancel it as \"the team wasn't feeling it\", according to director Brian Allgeier. Now in 2001 and struggling with ideas, Chief Creative Officer Brian Hasting proposed the idea of \"an alien that travels from planet to planet, collecting weapons and gadgets\", an idea inspired from Spaceman Spiff from Calvin & Hobbes and from Marvin the Martian. This idea inspired the team since it would allow them to create new worlds and characters to develop. Artists sketched a number of concepts for this alien character, which was originally reptilian, but ended up as a new species they called a \"Lombax\", a name Price had come up with. Along with this character they named Ratchet, they gave him a robotic companion, Clank. Originally developed as a childlike version of the Star Wars character C-3PO, they later decided that Ratchet and Clank should work instead like a buddy cop film, and made Clank an equal to Ratchet.", "The first game Ratchet & Clank, released in 2002, was successful. In planning the second, they revamped Ratchet's character, as they felt the first game portrayed him as a jerk, according to writer TJ Fixman, and softened the character to make him more relatable, at that point hiring James Arnold Taylor to voice the character (Ratchet's behavior toward Clank in Tools of Destruction when speaking about the existence of the Zoni and the risks posed by the Dimesionator could be a hint or reference to the character in the first game). They spent more time on developing interesting weapons to make the combat as enjoyable as the platforming sections of the game. Both the sequel Going Commando and the following game Up Your Arsenal were well-received and considered commercial successes. Allgeier considered that these games had success because they were continually evolving the series to match the current climate in video games, where mascot-driven games had fallen out of favor, and the company had adopted an \"adapt or die\" mentality for each title. The \"adapt or die\" approach was used for the fourth title, Ratchet: Deadlocked (2005), as they made the title darker and more combat-oriented given the popularity of the Halo and Grand Theft Auto series. While the game was well received, this approach was not met well by players, as it veered too much from the buddy cop concept, lacked the exploration of previous games and comedy in the writing. The balance between keeping to the \"DNA\" of a Ratchet & Clank game against the \"adapt or die\" mantra would continue to be a struggle throughout Insomniac's development of the series.", "Insomniac was asked to help create one of the launch titles for the PlayStation 3, Resistance: Fall of Man (2006). The company used this title to acclimate itself to the new hardware, and did not push the capabilities of the game engine. With this title under wraps, Insomniac was then able to consider how to approach the fifth Ratchet & Clank game, knowing how to work the PlayStation 3 hardware with the aim to make a game that played like an animated movie. Insomniac brought on Fixman to write for the series at this point; one of Fixman's first goals was to take disjointed mythology from the first four games and flesh out the characters more to give them a stronger backstory. This led to the three Future games, the first being Tools of Destruction (2007), which brought the series back to what players had latched onto and met with praise, outside of its cliffhanger ending. However, between this and having to drop a planned co-operative element from Tools of Destruction, Insomniac wanted to produce a new title quickly for Sony to avoid some of these concerns, and came up with the more experimental Quest for Booty (2008), a shorter title that played with gameplay elements not previously used in the series, like conversation trees.

Angela then disguised herself and stole the prototype creature to get rid of it for good.

The report also confirms her species as a female Lombax, claiming that female Lombaxes do not have tails (thus after Rift Apart, this seem no longer to be the case, thus another simpler explanation is that Angela, since she appear to have regardless a ponytail in the shape of Lombax tail, may have lost her original tail in an accident or she may be the result of the cross-breeding of a Lombax with another alien species).

In his youth, Azimuth was close friends with Ratchet's father, Kaden, and carries a pocketwatch that holds a photo of the two of them standing together. Azimuth was indirectly responsible for Emperor Tachyon's rise to power and the deaths of Ratchet's parents, as he gave Tachyon full access to Lombax technology in the hopes that he would be able to help them.

General Azimuth explains to Ratchet about Clank's presumed connection with the Zoni and how he and Kaden were both aware of the Great Clock's very existence. He then teaches Ratchet on using hoverboots which would come in handy in stopping Dr. Nefarious from taking control of the Great Clock. After Nefarious reminds Azimuth on how he shamed the Lombax race, Azimuth explains to Ratchet how he fell to Tachyon's trickery, and how he plans to use the Great Clock himself, so that he and Ratchet can prevent Tachyon's rise to power and stop the Lombaxes from having to leave for their new dimension.

Azimuth, now blinded by his own selfish desire to save all the Lombaxes, breaks into the chamber and locks the Clock into turning back time to Tachyon's rise to power, before engaging both Ratchet and Clank in a bloody duel as the game's final boss. Once defeated, Azimuth finally realizes his mistake and stops the time shift he created, though at the cost of his own life.

Most weapons have a limited amount of ammunition, requiring the player to use ammunition efficiently to avoid running out of firepower. Ammunition can be restocked from vendors or by breaking crates scattered about the levels. In most later games, weapons can be upgraded through both repeated use of the weapon and by purchasing weapon modifications. The weapons in each game can range from standard weapon archetypes such as machine guns or sniper rifles to unique weapons such as transformation guns and decoy launchers. Typically, the weapon set is a mixture of new weapons for the current title, and weapons returning from a previous title.

In addition to objectives based on platforming and weapon elements, missions may include minigames such as various races and arena combat. Typically, one or two of these minigames must be performed as part of the main story, but further optional challenges can be done to earn greater rewards, typically in the form of \"bolts\", the unit of currency used throughout the game.

Unbeknownst to many of his fans, Qwark was also egocentric and greedy to the point of making a secret deal with Chairman Drek to be the spokesperson for the new artificial planet Drek was building, even though he knew that Drek was harvesting other planets and terrorizing their inhabitants to do so. After Ratchet and Clank started interfering with Drek's plans, Qwark tricked them into believing he would help take down Drek and lured the duo to his private training facility on Planet Umbris, where he left them to die in a pit holding a vicious Blargian Snagglebeast; after the duo defeated the Snagglebeast, Qwark travelled to the Gemlik Moonbase and used a starfighter provided by Drek in an attempt to kill Ratchet and Clank himself, only to be shot down after a fierce battle. Having crash-landed on Planet Oltanis, Qwark adopted the alias \"Steve McQwark\" and resorted to selling gadgets which he claimed were genuine Gadgetron products, such as the PDA (Personal Delivery Assistant), and later the Gadgetron Personal Hygenator.", "Following the discovery of a key defect in the Hygenator which caused severe irritation in sensitive body areas, Qwark's true identity was exposed and he was quickly denounced as a fraud and a disgrace to Solana for previously working with Drek. He was then brought before a galactic court, which ordered him to pay 6 billion bolts to those suffering from Personal Hygenator Syndrome. Qwark refused to pay for the damages and tried to flee to Planet Pokitaru two days later but was immediately recaptured and placed in prison awaiting trial. After escaping from prison by flushing himself down a prison toilet during the events of the second game, Qwark managed to lay low for six weeks and re-adopted his alias as Steve McQwark before continuing to sell more Personal Hygenator units to unsuspecting customers, which he used to finance his comeback. Determined to restore his reputation, Qwark travelled to the neighboring Bogon Galaxy where he kidnapped Megacorp founder/CEO Abercrombie Fizzwidget, locked him in a supply closet, and used a sophisticated disguise to impersonate Fizzwidget in order to hire Ratchet and Clank to recover the Protopet, a failed Megacorp project that had been stolen by Angela Cross (posing as the \"Thief\") so she could destroy it. After recovering the Protopet, Qwark revealed his plan to mass-produce clones of the Protopet so he could manufacture a galaxy-wide crisis throughout Bogon, intending to frame Ratchet, Clank, and Angela for the disaster using Megacorp's broadcast system. He tries to neutralize the original Protopet's destructive tendencies with Angela's invention, the Helix-o-morph, rendering the copied Protopets harmless and thus restoring his ruined reputation; his plan failed when he accidentally put the batteries for the Helix-o-morph in backwards; this caused the original Protopet to mutate into a ferocious monster and devour Qwark. After Ratchet defeated the giant mutant Protopet, Angela fixed the Helix-o-morph and used it to neutralize the Protopets; as punishment, Qwark was assigned to work for Megacorp as a test subject on their newest product, the \"Crotchitizer\".", "Some time later, Qwark fled from Bogon and returned to the Solana Galaxy to live in exile on Planet Florana, where he bonded with a native tribe of cycloptic monkeys, even making one of them his companion and naming him Skrunch. Over time, he developed \"long-term amnesia\", causing him to completely forget his previous life. Now believing himself to be a monkey, Qwark becomes the Florona Tree Beast named by the locals. Ratchet and Clank travel to Florona by order of President Phyronix to find and escort him - along with Skrunch - back to the starship Phoenix, where they are able to fully restore Qwark's memory of who he once was by playing an old Captain Qwark vid-comic. Put in charge of the fight against Dr. Nefarious by President Phyronix, Qwark assembles the Q-Force (consisting of Skrunch, Big Al, Skidd McMarxx, Helga, Sasha Phyronix, Ratchet, and Clank) and assigned Ratchet and Clank to carry out several dangerous missions (for which he took all the credit), while he and others remained on the ship taking advantage of its many amenities. Qwark only started to help when Clank (who was actually a evil duplicate named Klunk), revealed that Nefarious' star cruiser, the Leviathan, was docked at the Zeldrin Starport; Nefarious waited until the Q-Force boarded the ship and then activated its self-destruct sequence. Qwark remained behind, claiming to have seen something important, and was presumed dead and mourned by his teammates when in reality, he managed to escape, returning to his secret base in the Thran Asteroid Belt. Ratchet, Clank, and Skrunch, having learned about the secret base from another vid-comic, found and confronted Qwark; Ratchet and Skrunch angrily berated and shamed Qwark for his cowardice and selfishness while Clank appealed to him with encouragement that he has a chance to truly redeem himself and become the hero he always wanted to be. Qwark initially refuses to help, but later returns to aid the duo in their final battle against Nefarious and his new \"Biobliterator\", flying in to distract Nefarious so Ratchet and Clank could focus on defeating him.

He later travelled to the Agorian Battleplex where he ended up fighting in the arena; after being saved again by Ratchet, Qwark adopted the Agorian's war grok and named it Snowball. He then used his high-school drama class training to go undercover as \"Nurse Shannon\" on the Nefarious Space Station.

Qwark later catches up with Ratchet and Clank after they recover the Technomite Artifact and begins secretly following the duo in the hopes that they'll let him tag along. Ratchet and Clank finally agree to let Qwark use their ship's computer to research his family history to get him off their backs. Qwark is then deceived by Emperor Otto Destruct of the Technomites, who claims to be his biological father and gets the gullible Qwark to help with his plan of enlarging himself and conquering the galaxy. After Ratchet and Clank defeated Otto, Skrunch arrives with a newspaper and a picture of Qwark's real parents, which reveals they were killed by defective Technomite technology. Upon learning the truth, Qwark was enraged that Otto knew what really happened to his parents and used it against him to get what he wanted. He then intends to get revenge on Otto and straps him in his own Intelligence Machine, planning to switch Otto's superior intellect with his own. Ratchet and Clank attempt in vain to reason with Qwark before Otto takes Ratchet's shrink ray to shrink him; however, this caused Skrunch to accidentally switch places with Qwark and trade minds with Otto, rendering him stupid and harmless.

After Clank defeated his evil counterpart Klunk, Qwark showed up wearing nothing but his swimming trunks, seemingly surprised that Clank had found him. Attempting to take a teleporter back to the surface, Qwark accidentally teleports himself onto Klunk's satellite; at the instruction of Clank, he removed the Eye of Infinity just before the laser activated, destroying the satellite, before teleporting himself out just in the nick of time. It was revealed in the final report that Qwark was in fact, like Ratchet and Clank, caught up in Klunk's schemes. Klunk is revealed to be responsible for paying Qwark the money for his biography, correctly guessing that Qwark would follow Clank around, allowing Klunk to keep tabs on the secret agent without employing a lackey.

When Ratchet enters a competition  held by the Rangers on Planet Veldin to find new recruits, he is brought before Qwark and his top agents for a special review. Qwark tells Ratchet that he has decent abilities, but that because of his \"loose-cannon\" nature, he is too much of a risk to be accepted as a Ranger, although it is also implied that Qwark is somewhat resentful of Ratchet easily passing his tests.
