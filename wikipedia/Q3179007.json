However he left to start on his own in vaudeville. He started in comedies, then went on to comedic roles in drama.\nHe appeared in 419 films between 1915 and 1953.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laurel and Hardy", "response": ["Seeing film comedies inspired him to take up comedy himself and, in 1913, he began working with Lubin Motion Pictures in Jacksonville. He started by helping around the studio with lights, props, and other duties, gradually learning the craft as a script-clerk for the company. It was around this time that Hardy married his first wife, Madelyn Saloshin.Everson 2000, p. 22. In 1914, Hardy was billed as \"Babe Hardy\" in his first film, Outwitting Dad. Between 1914 and 1916 Hardy made 177 shorts as Babe with the Vim Comedy Company, which were released up to the end of 1917.McCabe 1989, p. 30. Exhibiting a versatility in playing heroes, villains and even female characters, Hardy was in demand for roles as a supporting actor, comic villain or second banana. For 10 years he memorably assisted star comic and Charlie Chaplin imitator Billy West, and appeared in the comedies of Jimmy Aubrey, Larry Semon, and Charley Chase.Louvish 2001, pp. 107\u2013108. In total, Hardy starred or co-starred in more than 250 silent shorts, of which roughly 150 have been lost. He was rejected for enlistment by the Army during World War I due to his large size. In 1917, after the collapse of the Florida film industry, Hardy and his wife Madelyn moved to California to seek new opportunities.McCabe 1989, p. 32.Nizer, Alvin. \"The comedian's comedian.\"  Liberty Magazine, Summer 1975.
