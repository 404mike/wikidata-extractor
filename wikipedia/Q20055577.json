In October 2017, Johnson received manager of the month award for September, after guiding City to an undefeated streak of six games, scoring thirteen goals across that month. Later that month, as part of an interview for the BBC Points West programme, Johnson described his past of receiving death threats across the previous season, after completing the signing of Bristol Rovers striker Matty Taylor, also revealing how he was forced to move home, following the aftermath of his family's home address being publicised online. In the 2017\u201318 season, Johnson led the club to the semi-finals of the EFL Cup, defeating several Premier League clubs in the lead up, notably defeating Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Manchester United. During the semi-finals, Bristol City exited the competition after a 3\u20135 aggregate defeat to eventual champions Manchester City, a game in which saw opposition manager Pep Guardiola praise Johnson for his side's style of play. City ended the season in eleventh place in the Championship, eight points adrift from play-off qualification. In their following league campaign, Johnson's side finished the season in eighth place, their best league finish since the 2007\u201308 season, despite maintaining fifth position towards the closing stages of the season."]}, {"page": "Darrell Clarke", "response": ["He oversaw a rapid turnover of players for the 2014\u201315 season, releasing 16 players and signing 13 players on free transfers, including striker Matty Taylor. His first task however was to remove \u2018Clarke Out\u2019 posters that had been placed around the training ground by disgruntled fans. After a poor start Rovers rose up the table and ended the campaign in second place, one point behind Barnet. Clarke led Rovers to promotion with a 5\u20133 penalty shoot-out victory over Grimsby Town at Wembley Stadium in the 2015 Conference Premier play-off Final on 17 May 2015, after a 1\u20131 draw after extra time. He won three Manager of the Month awards during the season, in September, December and February. Rovers achieved a second successive promotion with a third-place finish in League Two in the 2015\u201316 campaign. Clarke was named as Manager of the Month for March after winning six of seven games by \"playing exciting and attacking football\" according to head judge George Burley. Promotion was achieved on the final day of the season with a stoppage-time winner against Dagenham & Redbridge, which took them above Accrington Stanley into third-place. Named as the Football League manager of the week, his citation stated that \"Clarke has performed wonders as his men have stormed up the table\". On 27 May 2016, Clarke turned down the opportunity to manage Championship club Leeds United and signed a new three-year contract with Bristol Rovers. He had met Leeds chairman Massimo Cellino but rejected the opportunity after Cellino told him he wanted an active role in player recruitment.", "He celebrated his 1000th day in charge of Rovers on 21 December 2016 with Rovers sitting 12th in the league heading into the Christmas period. He was named as EFL manager of the week after overseeing a 5\u20130 demolition of Northampton Town on 7 January. However that month he lost Matty Taylor after Bristol City activated his \u00a3300,000 release clause to make Taylor the first player to move from Rovers to City in 30 years. During late March 2017, with his club sitting just outside the League One play off places, Norwich City were reported to be interested in Clarke following the sacking of previous manager Alex Neil. Whilst Clarke never turned down any potential offer he instead pledged his loyalty to Rovers instead, the announcement coming a day after his three-year anniversary of his first Rovers match in charge.
