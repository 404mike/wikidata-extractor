These works reaching a general audience shown how accepted the clubs have become in general society.  This even extends to non-Japanese fiction, for example with the crime novel Tokyo (2000), by British author Mo Hayder, which has as its main character a British hostess starting out in the industry. The episode \"Meet Market\" of the American TV drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation featured a version of a host club in Las Vegas. In Isaac Adamson's novel Dreaming Pachinko, the character Miyuki worked at an exclusive hostess club in Ginza. The adventure video game series Yakuza allows the player to attend hostess clubs, and its sequel and prequel both have side-quests that allow the main character to become a host himself or manage a hostess club, gaining dominance in the area and hiring new talent. Japanese 2018 drama Todome no Kiss features Kento Yamazaki playing the role of a popular host under the stage name Eight, who works in a Kabukich\u014d nightclub called Narcissus.
