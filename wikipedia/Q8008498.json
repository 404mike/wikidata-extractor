He was awarded one cap for the Wales national football team for the match against Scotland on 26 March 1892.He started his career with his local side, Chirk F.C. as a teenager and graduated to the first team in 1891. Shortly afterwards, he moved to Manchester to join Fairfield. In the summer of 1893, he joined  Ardwick before moving on to Burnley. After a month with Ashton North End in May 1895, he joined Sheffield United in November, where he replaced his former Chirk team-mate, Joe Davies. Described as a \"tricky player\" who had a \"fine shot at goal\", Egan could play in any of the forward positions.After a season in Sheffield, in which he scored four goals from 15 league appearances, Egan moved on to Lincoln City before dropping into non-league football in 1897. After a further four years, in which he played for five clubs, he retired to return to his home town.He later moved to Derbyshire where he worked as a miner, dying in Tibshelf in 1946. Two of his sons, Harry and Doug became professional footballers, the former with Brighton, Southend United, Aldershot and Cardiff City and the latter with Derby County and Aldershot.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chirk", "response": ["* William Egan, Welsh international footballer"]}, {"page": "William Egan", "response": ["William Egan may refer to:", "*William Egan (footballer) (1872\u20131946), Welsh international footballer", "*William Egan (gangster) (1884\u20131921), St. Louis politician and organized crime figure", "*William Egan (hurler) (born 1990), Irish hurler"]}, {"page": "Tibshelf", "response": ["*William Egan - former Wales soccer international, died here in 1946."]}, {"page": "1946 in Wales", "response": ["**William Egan, footballer, 73 or 74"]}, {"page": "1893\u201394 Ardwick A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| William Egan", "| William Egan"]}, {"page": "Thomas William Egan", "response": ["#redirect William Egan (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Harry Egan", "response": ["Egan's father William Egan was also a professional footballer and won a single cap for Wales in 1892.
