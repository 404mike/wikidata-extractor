He played for Surrey's colts team, but left to join Somerset. He made his debut in 1902 and in his second match took the slip catch that dismissed Victor Trumper for just five \u2013 Trumper was dismissed a second time for five by the same bowler, George Gill, later in the match.\nHardy played as a professional in a mainly amateur team and made fairly regular appearances for Somerset right through to 1914. In 1910, when the side lost 15 out of 18 County Championship matches and failed to secure a single point all season, he headed the Somerset batting figures with 700 runs, including his own highest score of 91 against the champions, Kent, at Taunton. His best bowling figures, six for 82, also came in that season, against Middlesex at Bath.\nHardy's death is something of a mystery. He was, in the words of Wisden's 1917 edition, \"found dead on the floor of a lavatory at King's Cross station (G.N.R.)... His throat was cut and a blood-stained knife was by his side.\" Hardy was serving as a private with the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) at the time. The historian David Foot wrote that the knife was Hardy's own and that the death was suicide brought on by distress at being sent back to the World War I battlefield. Hardy, who left a widow, Maud Mary, was buried at St Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green", "response": ["*Percy Hardy (1880-1916), first-class cricketer; committed suicide while serving during World War I.https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2906074/FREDERICK%20PERCY%HARDY "]}, {"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Percy Hardy "]}, {"page": "Hardy (surname)", "response": ["*Percy Hardy, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Percy Hardy (1902\u20131914) 99 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were murdered", "response": ["| 1 || Percy Hardy || Found dead on the floor of a lavatory at King's Cross station with his throat cut and a blood-stained knife by his side. || 9 March 1916 || Somerset history maintains Hardy committed suicide rather than be sent back to World War I battlefields.|| "]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Percy Hardy"]}, {"page": "John Flowers (cricketer)", "response": ["Flowers made two first-class appearances for Sussex against Somerset and Gloucestershire in the 1905 County Championship.
