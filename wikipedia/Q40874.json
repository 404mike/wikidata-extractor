She was born to British parents in Iran, where she lived until 1925. Her family then moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where she remained until moving in 1949 to London, England. Her novels include The Grass Is Singing (1950), the sequence of five novels collectively called Children of Violence (1952\u20131969), The Golden Notebook (1962), The Good Terrorist (1985), and five novels collectively known as Canopus in Argos: Archives (1979\u20131983).\nLessing was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature. In awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy described her as \"that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny\". Lessing was the oldest person ever to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.In 2001, Lessing was awarded the David Cohen Prize for a lifetime's achievement in British literature. In 2008, The Times ranked her fifth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bildungsroman", "response": ["* Children of Violence by Doris Lessing (1952\u20131969)"]}, {"page": "J.

Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality (regardless of the gender of the lovers).  Birth-giving, often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women's rights and roles, has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience.  When a child is born, it spends most of its time in the children's ward with peers. Three \"mothers\" per child are the norm and they are chosen in a gender neutral way (men as well as women may become \"mothers\") on the basis of their experience and ability. Technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex. The fictional aliens in Mary Gentle's Golden Witchbreed start out as gender-neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, Doris Lessing's The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In My Own Utopia (1961) by Elizabeth Mann Borghese, gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex\u00a0\u2013 genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men. \"William Marston's Wonder Woman comics of the 1940s featured Paradise Island, also known as Themyscira, a matriarchal all-female community of peace, loving submission, bondage and giant space kangaroos.\"Noah Berlatsky, \"Imagine There's No Gender: The Long History of Feminist Utopian Literature,\" The Atlantic, April 15, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/imagine-theres-no-gender-the-long-history-of-feminist-utopian-literature/274993/"]}]}}
