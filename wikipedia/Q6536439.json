Its chairmen included Alderman Sir Herbert Carden (1929\u201339) and Lewis Cohen, Baron Cohen of Brighton.  Under Carden's leadership, its assets increased by nearly 225 times to nearly \u00a35\u00a0million. In 1935 the society commissioned architect Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel to design a new head office on North Street, Brighton's main commercial street since the start of the 19th century and home to many large banks and offices. A site on the corner of Prince's Place was chosen; this short street, dominated by the Chapel Royal, was laid out in the 18th century and originally led to Promenade Grove, Brighton's first pleasure gardens (now part of the Royal Pavilion grounds). The office opened in 1936, although some clerical staff still occupied premises on New Road nearby.  During World War II, important documents and other assets were moved to Saddlescombe on the South Downs, where they were stored underground, and the roof of the building was used to mount a battery of anti-aircraft guns. The building society established a sports and social club in 1935 and housed it in the basement of the partly built office.  Consisting at first of \"15 members and a second-hand table tennis table and dartboard\", over the years it developed into the Alliance Sports Club, a major corporate sports and social club."]}, {"page": "Baron Cohen of Brighton", "response": ["#REDIRECTLewis Cohen, Baron Cohen of Brighton"]}]}}
