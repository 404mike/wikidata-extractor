R. Watts as first team manager in 1930, a committee would deal with first team affairs, such as choosing the team on a matchday. Doc Dowden was appointed manager in 1946, and stayed in the position until leaving at the end of the 1954\u201355 season. Les Henley arrived in his place as first team coach, and stayed at the club for sixteen years in which the club progressed immensely, winning the FA Amateur Cup as well as three Isthmian League championships before turning professional and moving to the Southern League. However, in 1971 Henley was replaced by Mike Everitt, who arrived as player-manager. After two seasons, Everitt left to manage Brentford and Dick Graham arrived as a replacement. Graham remained until March 1974, and a replacement was not appointed until July of that year, when Allen Batsford was made manager. Batsford led Wimbledon to The Football League, but resigned only halfway through the first League season. Dario Gradi was made manager three days later, but after three seasons he too resigned. His replacement was Dave Bassett, who took Wimbledon to sixth in the First Division before moving to Watford. Bobby Gould spent three years as manager before being replaced by Ray Harford, who spent just over a season with Wimbledon. After Harford, Peter Withe had a spell as manager lasting only three months. Joe Kinnear was brought in during January 1992, and managed the club until leaving in 1999 due to ill health. A season was spent under Egil Olsen in which the team was relegated from the FA Premier League before Terry Burton was made manager. Burton's Wimbledon narrowly missed the play-offs twice in a row before he was sacked. Stuart Murdoch managed Wimbledon for the club's final two seasons."]}, {"page": "Nunhead F.C.", "response": ["* Les Henley"]}, {"page": "Leslie Henley", "response": ["#REDIRECTLes Henley"]}, {"page": "Henley (name)", "response": ["* Les Henley (1922\u20131996), British football (soccer) player/manager"]}, {"page": "Mike Everitt (footballer)", "response": ["Everitt began his managerial career as player-manager of Plymouth City in 1970, but his tenure was ended when the club folded midway through the 1971\u201372 season.

Everitt narrowly avoided a finish in the re-election places at the end of the 1973\u201374 season, but was sacked by incoming chairman Dan Tana in January 1975.
