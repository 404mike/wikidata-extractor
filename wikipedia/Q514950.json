For the most part theirs were genre works catering to readers in the circulating libraries of the 19th century. Among them was the gothic novel The miser and his family (1800) by Eliza Parsons and Catherine Hutton's The miser married (1813). The latter was an epistolary novel in which Charlotte Montgomery describes her own romantic affairs and in addition those of her mother, an unprincipled spendthrift who has just married the miser of the title. Another female novelist, Mary E. Bennett (1813\u201399), set her The Gipsy Bride or the Miser's Daughter (1841) in the 16th century. Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Aurora Floyd (1863) was a successful sensation novel in which banknotes rather than gold are the object of desire and a motive for murder. It was dramatised the same year and later toured the US; in 1912 it was made a silent film. Later examples include Eliza Lynn Linton's Paston Carew, Millionaire and Miser (1886); Miser Farebrother (1888) by Benjamin Leopold Farjeon; and Dollikins and the Miser (1890) by the American Frances Eaton. In 1904 Jerome K. Jerome created Nicholas Snyders, The Miser of Zandam in a sentimental story of the occult in which the Dutch merchant persuades a generous young man to exchange souls with him."]}, {"page": "The Horrors of Oakendale Abbey", "response": ["The novel tells the story of Laura, a foundling refugee from revolutionary France, her attempted seduction at the hands of Lord Oakendale and her explorations of the haunted Cumberland abbey of the title which lead her to stumble upon a den of resurrection men and body snatchers. It is unusually graphic in its depiction of death and decay, even by the standards of the day, in terms of its descriptions of the gruesome. The book is similar in some respects to Eliza Parsons' The Castle of Wolfenbach although it does not have the same emotional subtlety of that work."]}, {"page": "The Castle of Wolfenbach", "response": ["The Castle of Wolfenbach (1793) is the most famous novel written by the English Gothic novelist Eliza Parsons. First published in two volumes in 1793, it is among the seven \"horrid novels\" recommended by the character Isabella Thorpe in Jane Austen's novel Northanger Abbey and an important early work in the genre, predating Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho and Monk Lewis's The Monk.", "\"Your story, which the Marquis related, convinced me you had every virtue which should adorn your sex, joined with a courage and perseverance, through difficulties which might do honor even to our's. Since I have been admitted a visitor in this house, I have been confirmed in the exalted opinion I entertained of your superiority to most women, and under this conviction I may justly fear you will condemn my presumption, in offering myself and fortune to your disposal.\"Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City: Valancourt Books, 2007, p. 118. Matilda rejects the Count de Bouville's proposal, not because she doesn't love him, but because she comes from an obscure background. ", "The novel begins with Matilda and her servant Albert coming to the home of Jacqueline and Pierre as she seeks refuge from her Uncle, Mr. Weimar, arriving as someone wholly dependent on Jacqueline and Pierre, without friends, family or history.Edward Copeland, Women Writing about Money: Women's Fiction in England 1790\u20131820. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1995.). This makes her hiding easier, as there is nothing by which she can be readily identified.  A sick Matilda asks to stay with Jacqueline and Pierre, but they have no place for her \u2013 she and Albert go to the Castle of Wolfenbach, which is rumoured to be haunted. As Matilda seeks refuge there, we meet the first example of the hiding/secrecy theme. Matilda arrives having no idea that the castle has secrets of its own. It is rumoured to be haunted, but this haunting is actually produced by the caretaker, Joseph. He has been instructed by the Count to keep the Count's wife, Victoria, locked up there and her status as an occupant a secret. Joseph must even disguise this from his wife Bertha, the second caretaker of the castle. The Count of Wolfenbach has previously faked the death of Victoria and their son. The Count has hidden Victoria so as not to arouse suspicion. Not only is Joseph given the task of keeping Victoria hidden, but he is also to make the castle seem haunted, by rattling chains and making other haunting, frightening noises that will keep others away and further reduce the chance of Victoria being found.  Joseph must keep the Countess's presence secret, for he would be murdered if he ever \"betrayed her place of residence, or life, to any one.Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 151.", "A prominent story line in the novel is what the Count did with Victoria and their child after faking both their deaths and keeping her locked in his castle. This is revealed later as the Count explains how Victoria's son is both alive and an \"officer now in the Emperor's service. After revealing this to Victoria, the Count relates what has transpired since he faked the deaths and left them. He admits he was unable to live peacefully with his deeds weighing heavily on his mind, and how fearful he was that they would one day be discovered, so that \"life became a burthen (burden) to me.\"Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, 1793, p. 151. Furthermore, the Count details how he searched the Countess' apartment, found evidence of Matilda being there and soon after drugged Joseph with opium, locked all the windows and doors, and then set fire to the castle. The Count goes on to discuss how he left the castle and waited for the news of it being burned down.  He then feigned distress and sadness about the loss of Joseph and his wife and was consoled by others for his loss with no one suspecting that he was the one who actually started the fire. In addition, the Count discusses his plans to murder both Victoria and her servant, Margarite, so that there would be no remaining people who could reveal his secret. He was able to kill Margarite and as he took Victoria to the woods to kill her, he was thrown from his horse and Victoria was able to escape as the Count and his servant were distracted. ", "In The Castle of Wolfenbach, the heroine Matilda Weimar and the secondary heroine, Victoria Wolfenbach, are subject to regular fits of fainting. Sometimes they are saved from losing consciousness by material objects in their path as they fall. It could be a chair (\"She sunk fainting into a chair.\")Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 27. smelling salts (\u201cShe turned sick and faint, was obliged to have recourse to her salts.\")Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 122. or best of all, the arms of a lover (\"down she dropped, and had not the Count been attentive to her motions, and caught her in his arms, she must have fallen to the ground.\")Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 60. More often than not, however, the heroines have no dashing men, furniture or chemicals to protect their fall and must finish their frenzy of sentimentality on the cold, merciless ground: \"[I] fell senseless,\"Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 97. or \"in a few minutes afterwards I fell senseless from my seat\".Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 49/", "While fainting in The Castle of Wolfenbach is excessive, weeping is still more so. Victoria and Matilda weep four times as often as they faint; their tears are as varied in cause as copious in amount. They deplore their fates: \"'What can I \u2013 what ought I to do?' cried she, shedding a torrent of tears\";Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 28. they exit a room heroically: \"She quitted the apartment with a flood of tears\";Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 32. they express relief: \"A friendly burst of tears relieved her beating heart\u201d;Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 69. they show gratitude: \"Matilda's grateful heart overflowed; speech indeed was not lent her, but her tears, her expressive looks forcibly conveyed the language she could not utter\";Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 79. it acts as an emotional outlet: \"I must have vent for my feelings, or I shall be opprest to death. She burst into tears\";Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 166. Tears also accompany mourning of dead children, reunion of lost family members, and hearing and telling of personal tragedies. Wherever she can, Parsons has characters weep. In fact Matilda and Victoria spend most of their time alternately weeping and fainting, as though they were favourite pastimes.", "The Castle of Wolfenbach walks a fine line between realistic and theatrical. As scholar Robert Kiely has pointed out, Gothic abounds in theatricality and \"the works [of romantic novelists] often seem about to turn into plays or poems.\"Robert Kiely, \"Introduction\", The Romantic Novel in England, 1972, Cambridge, p. 11. It is almost impossible not to parody such unrealistic, sentimental plots. With fainting and weeping, the most theatrically ridiculous occurrence is when Matilda Weimar saves herself from fainting by a \"copious flood of tears\".Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books, p. 14. Furthermore, the plot seems as if it could be easily given a Shakespearean format. It contains heroines on a quest, star-crossed lovers, property-scheming villains, bumbling servants, and \"ghosts\" on top of them all \u2013 Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear and All's Well That Ends Well rolled into one; that is, if it were in the least bit realistically theatrical, rather than irredeemably ridiculous in its theatricality.", "Another theme in The Castle of Wolfenbach and often in Gothic novels as a genre, is secret parentage, unknown identity and questing to find oneself. As the Introduction to the Valancourt Edition points out, \"[Matilda's] challenge in the novel is to discover the secret of her birth, find her parents, and inherit her rightful property.\"Diane Long Hoeveler, \"Introduction\", The Castle of Wolfenbach, Kansas City, MO, Valancourt Books, 2007, p. xi. Robert Miles, in his genealogy of Gothic writing, claims that in these novels \"the usurped and disposed find their rights restored; the lost are found, and a true genealogy reasserts itself.\"Robert Miles, \"Narratives of Descent\", Gothic Writing 1750\u20131820: A Genealogy, New York, 2002, p. 100/ In fact, these things happen to Matilda; she discovers her parentage, finds her mother and inherits her noble class title. The Gothic and Romantic genres are obsessed with perfect, unsullied aristocratic lineages. It is Matilda's unwritten and unknown history that keeps her so long apart from her true love, the Count de Bouville; she cannot admit that she loves him until she discovers her ancestry: \"She was of noble birth; no unlawful offspring, no child of poverty: then she thought of the Count.\".Eliza Parsons, The Castle of Wolfenbach, 1793.
