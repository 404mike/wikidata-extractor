Though he was not an original member, he was regarded as being integral to the group's sound. He played the vibraphone, flute, piano, synthesizers and occasional drums, and he was with the band from late 1969 until late 1972.\nPalmer originally played in a group called The Hellions, which featured future Traffic members Jim Capaldi and Dave Mason, Jim and Poli later formed Deep Feeling, which also included future Spooky Tooth member Luther Grosvenor.  Palmer was briefly involved later with acts such as the Blossom Toes, Bakerloo and Ian Matthews' Southern Comfort, formed by the former Fairport Convention frontman of that name. He was in the folk rock band Eclection with whom he performed at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, before joining Family.\nPalmer replaced Jim King in Family and immediately went to work on the group's third album, A Song For Me.  Many of that album's songs had to be re-arranged, as they were written with King's saxophone and harmonica in mind.  Palmer rose to the challenge, transforming songs with his different instruments.  \"Drowned in Wine\" became a full-blown rocker with his overamplified flute, and his vibraphones added a jazz touch to the blues number \"Love Is a Sleeper.\"  A Song For Me was released in January 1970 to rave reviews, and Family seemed re-invigorated by Palmer's arrival.\nPalmer contributed to the next two Family albums, Anyway and Fearless. On the latter album, released in 1971, Palmer contributed the jazz instrumental \"Crinkly Grin\" and the song \"Larf and Sing,\" which he sang lead on himself.  After 1972's Bandstand and a U.S. tour as the warmup act for Elton John, Palmer left Family to form a group with fellow Family alumnus Ric Grech and Mitch Mitchell, but that effort never got anywhere.\nPalmer's other credits include work on two albums from British soul singer Linda Lewis, 1972's Lark and 1973's Fathoms Deep.  He also has worked with Peter Frampton, and Elkie Brooks, he made guest appearances on albums from the post-Family band Streetwalkers and on solo albums from former Family lead singer Roger Chapman.  Palmer contributed tuned percussion on Pete Townshend's 1982 solo album All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes.\nHe wrote the music for the rock opera Hero, produced in 1976 by the Australian Opera in Sydney.\nIn 1985, Palmer released Human Error, a solo record featuring King Crimson and Bad Company alumnus Boz Burrell and Mel Collins also of King Crimson fame. It featured the Fairlight CMI synthesizer extensively and was recorded in Burrell's studio. In 1986, he produced and provided Fairlight programming to the Kevin Ayers release As Close as You Think, recorded at the same studio.\nIn recent years, Palmer has split time between gigging and music computer work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 25", "response": ["*  1943   \u2013 John Palmer, English keyboard player "]}, {"page": "John Palmer", "response": ["John Palmer may refer to:", "*John Palmer (fl. 1377\u20131394), English politician", "*Sir John Palmer, 5th Baronet (1735\u20131817), British politician", "*John Palmer (1785\u20131840), U.S. Congressman from New York", "*John Palmer (politician) (1842\u20131905), former secretary of state of New York and commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic", "*John Palmer (architect) (1785\u20131846), English architect", "*John Palmer (Bath architect) (1738\u20131817), English architect", "*John Palmer (Unitarian, 1729?\u20131790), English minister, active in the Midlands and north", "*John Palmer (Unitarian, 1742\u20131786), English minister, active in the south", "*John Palmer (Master of Magdalene College) (died 1607), English clergyman and academic", "*John Palmer (Archdeacon of Southern Melanesia) (1837\u20131902)", "*John Palmer (cricketer) (1881\u20131928), English cricketer", "*John Palmer (musician) (born 1943), English musician", "*John Palmer (composer) (born 1959), composer of instrumental and electronic music", "*John Palmer, alias of highwayman Dick Turpin (1705\u20131739)", "*John Palmer (criminal) (1950\u20132015), convicted time-share fraudster, nicknamed \"Goldfinger\"", "*John Palmer, 4th Earl of Selborne (1940\u20132021), British peer and businessman", "*John Palmer (actor) (1742?\u20131798), English actor", "*John Palmer (author) (1885\u20131944), English author", "*John Palmer (Commissary of New South Wales) (1760\u20131833)", "*John Palmer (director) (1943\u20132020), Canadian film and theatre director", "*John Palmer (postal innovator) (1742\u20131818), inventor of the lightweight mail coach", "*John Palmer (colonial administrator) (c. 1650 \u2013 c. 1700), first Englishman to purchase land in the Rockaway Peninsula", "*John Palmer (TV journalist) (1935\u20132013), former NBC News correspondent", "*John Palmer (Home and Away), fictional character", "*John Palmer (1807 ship)", "*John Palmer (1810 ship)", "*John Palmer (1814 schooner), a ship wrecked in Bass Strait in 1818"]}, {"page": "Fearless (Family album)", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by John Palmer (musician)"]}, {"page": "A Song for Me", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by John Palmer (musician)"]}, {"page": "John \"Poli\" Palmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Palmer (musician)"]}, {"page": "Poli Palmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Palmer (musician)"]}]}}
