She led the convoy back to sea on 2 February, bound for Devonport where they arrived on 17 February. The ship then sailed to Liverpool to begin a lengthy refit and was paid off there on 7 March. She recommissioned on 4 August and spent the next two weeks preparing to go back to sea. Cornwall departed Liverpool on 17 August and escorted at least one troopship to Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving there a week later. She was now assigned to the North Atlantic and West Indies StationNewbolt, V, p. 135 and began escorting convoys between North America and Britain on 19 September. Cornwall continued in this role for the next year and escorted her last convoy when she arrived in Bermuda on 18 October 1918. She departed the island on 14 December and arrived at Devonport eight days later. The ship resumed her prewar role as a cadet training ship on 25 January 1919. Vice-Admiral Morgan Singer, Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies Station, inspected the ship on 9 May while she was berthed in Bermuda. Cornwall returned to Devonport on 31 July and was paid off on 21 August. The ship was sold for scrap on 7 June 1920. In 1922, Mount Cornwall in the Canadian Rockies was named in tribute to the ship."]}, {"page": "Queen Elizabeth-class battleship", "response": ["Each gun was provided with 130 rounds. Stowage was provided for 30 rounds at each gun as the only ammunition hoists for them were located at the forward end of the battery. Captain Morgan Singer, commander of the RN's gunnery school HMS Excellent, criticized this arrangement, saying that it had been proven inefficient in the pre-dreadnought battleships and he recommended using dredger hoists as they were much faster. His comments were rejected as the Admiralty believed that the guns would only intermittently be in use as destroyers attempted to close to torpedo range and they desired to maintain a break in the cordite supply between the magazines and the battery. In service this led to the gun crews keeping additional rounds immediately available at the guns in case they were needed.Raven & Roberts, pp. 20, 26 This resulted in an ammunition fire aboard Malaya during the Battle of Jutland that nearly resulted in the loss of the ship.Campbell 1998, p. 132"]}, {"page": "North America and West Indies Station", "response": ["* Vice Admiral Sir Morgan Singer (1919)"]}, {"page": "HMS Excellent (shore establishment)", "response": ["|| Captain Morgan Singer, AdC."]}, {"page": "Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda", "response": ["* Rear-Admiral Morgan Singer, 15 December 1917"]}, {"page": "HMS Flying Fish (1897)", "response": ["She served in the Portsmouth instructional flotilla under the command of Commander Morgan Singer until early January 1901.

After leaving Devonport for her commission in February 1902, she encountered hard weather in the Bay of Biscay and was knocked about so that she started leaking, and had to port at Brest. She was sufficiently repaired to be able to return to Devonport for more extensive repairs in late February, and eventually arrived at Malta two months late on 16 April 1902. In September 1902 she visited the Aegean Sea with other ships of the station for combined manoeuvres near Nauplia."]}, {"page": "Memorial tablets to the British Empire dead of the First World War", "response": ["The tablet at Arras Cathedral, the latest to be erected, was unveiled on 10 May 1936 by the Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper, present in his role as Chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission.
