Having initially entered the Merchant Navy, he won an ex-Serviceman's scholarship to train at RADA. Urquhart made his stage debut in 1947, while his first film role was in You're Only Young Twice (1952).He appeared in many television shows of the detective/special-agent genre, such as Department S, Callan, The Professionals, Man in a Suitcase, The Avengers, and opposite Patrick McGoohan in the episodes of Danger Man entitled \"English Lady Takes Lodgers\" and \"It's Up To The Lady\" (1965) and as the title character in \"The Man with the Foot\" (1966). He also played the lead role and served as script editor in Jango, a short lived 1961 production by Associated Rediffusion. Urquhart also starred as Wing Commander MacPhearson in the 1970s series Pathfinders.He was married twice, first to the actress Zena Walker, and then to the Scottish hotelier and politician Jean Urquhart. He died in Edinburgh on 21 March 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yes Minister", "response": ["* Tom Sargent (Robert Urquhart), Hacker's predecessor as Minister for Administrative Affairs in the previous government, made one appearance in the episode \"Big Brother\".

Gawain appears as a supporting character in films such as Knights of the Round Table (1953, played by Robert Urquhart) and Excalibur (1981, played by Liam Neeson), all of which draw on elements of Gawain's traditional characterizations.Blanch & Wasserman, p. 185. Other films give Gawain a larger role. In the 1954 adaptation of Prince Valiant, he is a somewhat boorish, though noble and good-natured, foil for his squire and friend, Valiant.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 187\u201388. He plays his traditional part in the 1963 film Sword of Lancelot (played by George Baker), seeking revenge when Lancelot kills his unarmed brother Gareth, but ultimately coming to Lancelot's aid when he uncovers Mordred's responsibility.Williams, p. 386. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight has been adapted to film several times, including 1973's Gawain and the Green Knight (played by Murray Head) and 1984's Sword of the Valiant (played by Miles O'Keeffe), both directed by Stephen Weeks; neither film was well reviewed and both deviate substantially from the source material.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 190\u201391 A 1991 television adaptation by Thames Television, Gawain and the Green Knight, was both more faithful and better received.Blanch & Wasserman, pp. 191\u201393. Other film portrayals included Robert Gwyn Davin's in First Knight (1995), Anthony Hickox in Prince Valiant (1997), Sebastian Roch\u00e9 in Merlin (1998), Noah Huntley in The Mists of Avalon (2001), and Joel Edgerton in King Arthur (2004). In the 2008 television series Merlin, Gawain appears as Sir Gwaine, played by Eoin Macken. Though of noble origin, he passes himself as a peasant due to his mother's mistreatment by the king his father served; he is finally knighted by Arthur due to his personal value. In the 2011 series Camelot, he is played by Clive Standen. In 2020's Cursed, Gawain is played by Matt Stokoe, who doubles as the Green Knight. In the 2021 film The Green Knight, Gawain is portrayed by Dev Patel."]}, {"page": "Kirkcudbright", "response": ["Robert Urquhart starred in a 1980 BBC adaptation of Ibsen's An Enemy of the People, shot on location in Kirkcudbright."]}, {"page": "1995 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 21 || Robert Urquhart || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 73 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor, writer || "]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Dogs of War || United Artists || John Irvin (director); Gary DeVore, George Malko (screenplay); Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Colin Blakely, Hugh Millais, Paul Freeman, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois St\u00e9venin, JoBeth Williams, Maggie Scott, Robert Urquhart, Winston Ntshona, Pedro Armend\u00e1riz Jr., Harlan Cary Poe, Ed O'Neill, Shane Rimmer, George Harris, David Schofield, Terence Rigby, Olu Jacobs, Alan Beckwith, Jim Broadbent || War || Live action"]}, {"page": "An Enemy of the People", "response": ["This classic play was adapted by Arthur Miller in the 1950s in a production that opened at the Broadhurst Theater on December 28, 1950.

It was also made into a movie of the same name in 1978, starring Steve McQueen.

Retrieved on January 13, 2008.  In the creation of his adaptation of Ibsen's work, several changes were made by Miller to make the play more accessible and accepting to a 1950s audience, as opposed to Ibsen's late 1800s audience. Many major edits not only included the transformation of speech and language, but changes were made to the character of Dr. Stockmann to avoid having him champion eugenics. Throughout the play, Dr. Stockmann acts as a Christ figure. Miller found it necessary therefore to change Ibsen's use of genetic and racial theories from the late 1800s to further Dr. Stockmann's standing as a champion of the lower classes as opposed to a scientist with a belief in racial determinism and the importance of eugenics for \"improving\" people. For example, in Ibsen's original, a portion of Dr. Stockmann's speech to the people contained:"]}, {"page": "Yvonne De Carlo", "response": ["In the 1950s, one of her fianc\u00e9s was English photographer Cornel Lucas.
