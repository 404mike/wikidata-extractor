He defeated Steven Hallworth and Michael White both 5\u20133 to qualify for the German Masters and eliminated world number five Barry Hawkins 5\u20133 in the first round. In the last 16 he lost 5\u20132 to Stephen Maguire. A consistent season in the European Tour events saw King finish 24th on the Order of Merit to make his debut in the Grand Final. King secured another win over Hawkins this time 4\u20132 and looked like moving 3\u20132 ahead of Judd Trump in the last 16. However, Trump got the snooker he needed and won the next frame to defeat King. King closed the season with a 5\u20134 loss to Robin Hull in the second round of the China Open and was narrowly edged out 10\u20139 by Anthony McGill in the final round of World Championship qualifying. He fell outside the top 32 in the rankings for the first time since 1996 at the culmination of the season as he was 36th."]}, {"page": "Gerard Greene", "response": ["Greene played in the EBSA Play-off and saw off Ian Glover 4\u20132 and Steven Hallworth 4\u20131 to be awarded a two-year tour card."]}, {"page": "Q School (snooker)", "response": ["| Steven Hallworth"]}, {"page": "Players Tour Championship 2011/2012 \u2013 Event 1", "response": ["|  Steven Hallworth || align=\"center\"| 0\u20134 ||  Matthew Day"]}, {"page": "Players Tour Championship 2012/2013 \u2013 Event 1", "response": ["|  Lloyd Condron || align=\"center\"| 2\u20134 ||  Steven Hallworth", "|  Zak Surety || align=\"center\"| 4\u20130 ||  Steven Hallworth"]}, {"page": "Players Tour Championship 2012/2013 \u2013 Event 2", "response": ["|  Steven Hallworth || align=\"center\"| 4\u20132 ||  Andy Neck", "|  Andy Marriott || align=\"center\"| 4\u20132 ||  Steven Hallworth"]}, {"page": "European Tour 2012/2013 \u2013 Event 2", "response": ["|  Matthew Day || align=\"center\"| 4\u20133 ||  Steven Hallworth"]}, {"page": "European Tour 2013/2014 \u2013 Event 4", "response": ["|  Steven Hallworth || align=\"center\"| 4\u20130 ||  Thomas Kiesewetter", "|  Daniel Schneider || align=\"center\"| 2\u20134 ||  Steven Hallworth", "|  Joe Steele || align=\"center\"| 1\u20134 ||  Steven Hallworth"]}, {"page": "European Tour 2013/2014 \u2013 Event 3", "response": ["|  Steven Hallworth || align=\"center\"| 2\u20134 ||  Jeff Cundy"]}, {"page": "European Tour 2013/2014 \u2013 Event 6", "response": ["|  Wayne Townsend || align=\"center\"| 4\u20132 ||  Steven Hallworth"]}, {"page": "European Tour 2013/2014 \u2013 Event 7", "response": ["|  Steven Hallworth || align=\"center\"| 4\u20131 ||  Phuntsok Jaegers", "|  Adam Bobat || align=\"center\"| 1\u20134 ||  Steven Hallworth", "|  Steven Hallworth || align=\"center\"| 4\u20130 ||  Wim De Roeck"]}, {"page": "Snooker world rankings 2014/2015", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Steven Hallworth|| style=\"text-align:left;\"|||||||116||83||107||1,833||111||1,833||112||1,833||113||1,833||113||2,416||116||2,416"]}, {"page": "2014 Wuxi Classic", "response": ["|  Neil Robertson || align=\"center\"| 5\u20131 ||  Steven Hallworth"]}, {"page": "2014 Australian Goldfields Open", "response": ["* 114  Steven Hallworth"]}, {"page": "Stuart Carrington", "response": ["Stuart Carrington (born 14 May 1990) is an English professional snooker player.
