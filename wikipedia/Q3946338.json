The Finnish veteran would be partnered with Italian Franco Morbidelli. After a highly successful 2014, 2015 would mark a total polar opposite in performance and results. Initially the season started solidly, with three top eight results from the opening three rounds. But a fourth place at Argentina would be the high point of what would develop into a very difficult season for the Finnish rider. Four of the next seven races resulted in retirements. Indianapolis briefly offered a glimmer of hope after qualifying on the front row, until a coming together with Sam Lowes ended his race, ensuring more disappointment. Despite the best efforts from both Kallio and Italtrans to find a solution to difficulties Kallio faced with the 2015 Kalex, there was seemingly little hope of improvement. After the Misano race, it was decided on 14 September 2015, that both parties would mutually cancel the remainder of the contract and part company immediately."]}, {"page": "Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Sam Lowes"]}, {"page": "Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Sam Lowes"]}, {"page": "French motorcycle Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Sam Lowes"]}, {"page": "2006 British Superbike Championship", "response": ["|rowspan=2| Sam Lowes"]}, {"page": "Anthony West (motorcyclist)", "response": ["He rarely scored points again after that Dutch win, and he finished in 12th position with 72 points.
