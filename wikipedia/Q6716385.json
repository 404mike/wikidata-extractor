The song gained larger acclaim when an animated music video for the track, created by Rob Manuel, was released in 2004. Hibbett later collaborated with Manuel, who directed the music video for his song \"The Gay Train\".In 2004, Hibbett gained national exposure in the United Kingdom, on the Steve Lamacq show on BBC 6 Music, by regularly performing \"The Fair Play Trophy (Again)\", a song whose lyrics were updated for each rendition to reflect the then-ongoing events of the UEFA European Football Championship.\nHibbett's songs have mostly been released on his own record label, Artists Against Success. He is an advocate of the ukulele, which he has used for solo performances.Hibbett lives and works in London, where he is employed as a database administrator. He holds master's degrees from City University and De Montfort University and attended Deacon's School.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1970 in music", "response": ["**MJ Hibbett, English singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "De Montfort University", "response": ["* MJ Hibbett, singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "MJ", "response": ["* MJ Hibbett (born 1970), English guitarist singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "Phoenix FM", "response": ["The station's Creative Sessions have given studio recording time to unknown and young local bands as well as featuring established recording artists such as Republica,  Imogen Heap, Turin Brakes, Salad, Midway Still, Chris T-T and MJ Hibbett."]}, {"page": "Dinosaur Planet", "response": ["*Dinosaur Planet, a concept album by MJ Hibbett"]}, {"page": "List of guitarists", "response": ["*MJ Hibbett"]}, {"page": "Boom!
