He then spent a number of years as a secondary school teacher in different locations in the UK. He spent a long time as a lecturer in English Literature at St Paul's College, Cheltenham (a teacher training college with Bristol University qualifications). In 1982 he completed a doctorate at Warwick University with a thesis entitled 'Translations from German and their Reception in Britain 1760-1800'.  After retiring, he moved to Bristol, where he still lives, and worked with Timothy Mowl on a range of books on British architectural and garden history. These sometimes appear with Earnshaw as Mowl's co-author, and sometimes with him in Mowl's acknowledgement as a researcher. He has a great love of botany and travel, and has made extensive trips around Europe and elsewhere studying flowers, architecture, gardens and history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Astley Hall, Chorley", "response": ["* Timothy Mowl & Brian Earnshaw Architecture without kings, 1995, p.\u00a0174"]}, {"page": "Dragonfall 5", "response": ["Dragonfall 5 is a series of children's science fiction novels written by Brian Earnshaw during the 1970s and  illustrated by Simon Stern.", "* Brian Earnshaw Bibliography", "Category:Novels by Brian Earnshaw"]}, {"page": "Earnshaw", "response": ["* Brian Earnshaw, Welsh writer"]}, {"page": "Earnshaw, Brian", "response": ["#REDIRECTBrian Earnshaw"]}, {"page": "List of Jackanory episodes", "response": ["|2185|| Dragonfall 5 and the Empty Planet: Part 1 - Time for School || Brian Earnshaw || Ray Brooks || 14-Feb-77", "|2186|| Dragonfall 5 and the Empty Planet: Part 2 - Games and Lessons || Brian Earnshaw || Ray Brooks || 15-Feb-77", "|2187|| Dragonfall 5 and the Empty Planet: Part 3 - Lost Wood Hollow || Brian Earnshaw || Ray Brooks || 16-Feb-77", "|2188|| Dragonfall 5 and the Empty Planet: Part 4 - Walking, Talking Trees || Brian Earnshaw || Ray Brooks || 17-Feb-77", "|2189|| Dragonfall 5 and the Empty Planet: Part 5 - The Caves of Ice || Brian Earnshaw || Ray Brooks || 18-Feb-77"]}]}}
