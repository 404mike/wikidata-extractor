She noted that Drexel 5611 is one of only a few manuscripts that contain works by Hugh Facy.  Bailey considered Facy's works were \"part of the final vestiges of the contrapuntal tradition of the virginalists and evince a kinship with similar pieces by John Lugge, possibly resulting from a personal relationship with Lugge, who lived relatively nearby in Exeter.\" The organ works by Hugh Facy included in Drexel 5611 contribute to our understanding of organ literature at a time when organs were banned in churches and cathedrals."]}]}}
