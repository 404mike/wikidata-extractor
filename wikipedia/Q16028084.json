Kenyon was a librettist, a writer of essays and of some pieces of police literature.\nTrained as a musician, for several years Kenyon was the drama and music critic of Daily Critic. In 1901 under his own as name, he produced a study of the work of the writer and playwright Hall Caine and in 1904, a work for beginner musicians.\nAs a composer, his musical scores included The Maiden and the Flower Garden  (1914), an operetta for children. The orchestration by Julius Harrison of his Cleopatra cantata helped the young Harrison towards recognition as a composer.\nIn 1919 he used the pseudonym Gerald Cumberland to publish his \"Books of Reminiscences\", two important critical essays on musical life in England, as well some works of police literature. His book Set Down in Malice was partly based on his two extensive interviews (1906 and 1913) of Edward Elgar, and also describes a meeting with G.B.Shaw as A Terrible Walk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Julius Harrison", "response": ["He first came to wider public notice in 1908 with his setting of Gerald Cumberland's cantata libretto Cleopatra. Harrison's setting won the first prize at the Norwich Musical Festival, adjudicated by Frederick Delius, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ernest Walker. The Times commented on the inadequacy of the libretto, and praised Harrison's orchestration and melodies but complained that the work was \"a series of pictures of unbridled passion devoid of all that ordinary people call beauty.\"\"Norwich Musical Festival\". The Times. 31 October 1908. p. 13. The reviewer in The Manchester Guardian was more complimentary; though he commented on the obvious influence of Bantock, and over-elaborate orchestration, he wrote that Harrison had undoubted talent.\"The Norwich Festival\".
