He did postgraduate work at Sussex University on the rise of the extreme right in Germany in the early twentieth century. Before embarking on the series of historical monographs for which he is best known, he translated The Goebbels Diaries 1939\u20131941 into English and wrote novels set in Germany.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Konrad Adenauer", "response": ["Adenauer ensured a generally free and democratic society, except the banning of the communist party and the BND spying on SPD on behalf of the CDU (see #Intelligence services and spying), and laid the groundwork for Germany to reenter the community of nations and to evolve as a dependable member of the Western world. It can be argued that because of Adenauer's policies, a later reunification of both German states was possible, and unified Germany has remained a solid partner in the European Union and NATO. The British historian Frederick Taylor argued that in many ways the Adenauer era was a transition period in values and viewpoints from the authoritarianism that characterized Germany in the first half of the 20th century to the more democratic values that characterized the western half Germany in the second half of the 20th century.Taylor, Frederick Exorcising Hitler, London: Bloomsbury Press, 2011 page 371."]}, {"page": "Luftwaffe", "response": ["British historian Frederick Taylor asserts that \"all sides bombed each other's cities during the war.

This affected his attitude about post-D-Day directives to target oil installations, since he did not know that senior Allied commanders were using high-level German sources to assess just how much this was hurting the German war effort; thus Harris tended to see the directives to bomb specific oil and munitions targets as a \"panacea\" (his word) and a distraction from the real task of making the rubble bounce."]}, {"page": "Winston Churchill", "response": ["British historian Frederick Taylor has pointed out that the number of Soviet citizens who died from German bombing was roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids.

Andrew Marr, quoting Max Hastings, says that Churchill's memorandum was a \"calculated political attempt..... to distance himself..... from the rising controversy surrounding the area offensive\"."]}, {"page": "Bombing of Dresden in World War II", "response": ["On 31 January, Bottomley sent Portal a message saying a heavy attack on Dresden and other cities \"will cause great confusion in civilian evacuation from the east and hamper movement of reinforcements from other fronts\". British historian Frederick Taylor mentions a further memo sent to the Chiefs of Staff Committee by Air Marshal Sir Douglas Evill on 1 February, in which Evill states interfering with mass civilian movements was a major, even key, factor in the decision to bomb the city centre. Attacks there, where main railway junctions, telephone systems, city administration and utilities were, would result in \"chaos\". Ostensibly, Britain had learned this after the Coventry Blitz, when loss of this crucial infrastructure had supposedly longer-lasting effects than attacks on war plants.", "Strafing of civilians has become a traditional part of the oral history of the raids, since a March 1945 article in the Nazi-run weekly newspaper Das Reich claimed this had occurred. Historian G\u00f6tz Bergander, an eyewitness to the raids, found no reports on strafing for 13\u201315 February by any pilots or the German military and police. He asserted in Dresden im Luftkrieg (1977) that only a few tales of civilians being strafed were reliable in detail, and all were related to the daylight attack on 14 February. He concluded that some memory of eyewitnesses was real, but that it had misinterpreted the firing in a dogfight as deliberately aimed at people on the ground. In 2000, historian Helmut Schnatz found an explicit order to RAF pilots not to strafe civilians on the way back from Dresden. He also reconstructed timelines with the result that strafing would have been almost impossible due to lack of time and fuel.Helmut Schnatz, Tiefflieger \u00fcber Dresden? Legenden und Wirklichkeit (B\u00f6hlau, 2000, ), pp. 96, 99 Frederick Taylor in Dresden (2004), basing most of his analysis on the work of Bergander and Schnatz, concludes that no strafing took place, although some stray bullets from aerial dogfights may have hit the ground and been mistaken for strafing by those in the vicinity. The official historical commission collected 103 detailed eyewitness accounts and let the local bomb disposal services search according to their assertions. They found no bullets or fragments that would have been used by planes of the Dresden raids.", "The sirens started sounding in Dresden at 21:51 (CET). Frederick Taylor writes that the Germans could see that a large enemy bomber formation\u2014or what they called \"ein dicker Hund\" (lit: a fat dog, a \"major thing\")\u2014was approaching somewhere in the east. At 21:39 the Reich Air Defence Leadership issued an enemy aircraft warning for Dresden, although at that point it was thought Leipzig might be the target. At 21:59 the Local Air Raid Leadership confirmed that the bombers were in the area of Dresden-Pirna. Taylor writes the city was largely undefended; a night fighter force of ten Messerschmitt Bf 110Gs at Klotzsche airfield was scrambled, but it took them half an hour to get into an attack position. At 22:03 the Local Air Raid Leadership issued the first definitive warning: \"Warning! Warning! Warning! The lead aircraft of the major enemy bomber forces have changed course and are now approaching the city area\". Some 10,000 fled to the great open space of the Grosse Garten, the magnificent royal park of Dresden, nearly one and a half square miles in all. Here they were caught by the second raid, which started without an air-raid warning, at 1:22 a.m.  At 11:30 a.m., the third wave of bombers, the two hundred eleven American Flying Fortresses, began their attack.", "On 25 February, a new leaflet with photographs of two burned children was released under the title \"Dresden\u2014Massacre of Refugees\", stating that 200,000 had died. Since no official estimate had been developed, the numbers were speculative, but newspapers such as the Stockholm Svenska Morgonbladet used phrases such as \"privately from Berlin,\" to explain where they had obtained the figures. Frederick Taylor states that \"there is good reason to believe that later in March copies of\u2014or extracts from\u2014[an official police report] were leaked to the neutral press by Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry ... doctored with an extra zero to increase [the total dead from the raid] to 202,040\". On 4 March, Das Reich, a weekly newspaper founded by Goebbels, published a lengthy article emphasising the suffering and destruction of a cultural icon, without mentioning damage to the German war effort.Evans, Richard. Telling Lies about Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial p. 165.", "The bombing of Dresden remains controversial and is subject to an ongoing debate by historians and scholars regarding the moral and military justifications surrounding the event.. British historian Frederick Taylor wrote of the attacks: \"The destruction of Dresden has an epically tragic quality to it. It was a wonderfully beautiful city and a symbol of baroque humanism and all that was best in Germany. It also contained all of the worst from Germany during the Nazi period. In that sense it is an absolutely exemplary tragedy for the horrors of 20th century warfare and a symbol of destruction\".Hawley, Charles. \"Dresden Bombing Is To Be Regretted Enormously\" , interview with Frederick Taylor, Spiegel Online, 11 February 2005.", "Frederick Taylor told Der Spiegel, \"I personally find the attack on Dresden horrific. It was overdone, it was excessive and is to be regretted enormously,\" but, \"A war crime is a very specific thing which international lawyers argue about all the time and I would not be prepared to commit myself nor do I see why I should. I'm a historian.\" Similarly, British philosopher A. C. Grayling has described RAF area bombardment as an \"immoral act\" and \"moral crime\" because \"destroying everything... contravenes every moral and humanitarian principle debated in connection with the just conduct of war\", though Grayling insisted that it \"is not strictly correct to describe area bombing as a 'war crime'.\""]}, {"page": "Spiegel affair", "response": ["The scandal temporarily halted Strauss' political career and was remembered by many when Strauss ran for Bundeskanzler in 1980, clearly losing against his SPD opponent (and incumbent) Helmut Schmidt. However, it is mostly remembered for altering the political culture of post-war West Germany and \u2013 with the first mass demonstrations and public protests \u2013 being a turning point from the old Obrigkeitsstaat (authoritarian state) to a modern democracy. The British historian Frederick Taylor argued that the Federal Republic under Adenauer retained many of the characteristics of the authoritarian \"deep state\" that existed under the Weimar Republic, and that the Spiegel affair marked an important turning point in German values as ordinary people rejected the old authoritarian outlook in favour of the more democratic values that came to be seen as the bedrock of the Federal Republic.."]}, {"page": "History of Germany (1945\u20131990)", "response": ["In October 1962, the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel published an analysis of the West German military defense. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of Der Spiegel in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized under the orders of the CSU Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the Bundestag that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, Rudolf Augstein spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of Franz Josef Strauss, Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis by his heavy-handed attempt to silence Der Spiegel for essentially running a story that was unflattering to him (which incidentally was true). The British historian Frederick Taylor argued that the Federal Republic under Adenauer retained many of the characteristics of the authoritarian \"deep state\" that existed under the Weimar Republic, and that the Der Spiegel affair marked an important turning point in German values as ordinary people rejected the old authoritarian values in favor of the more democratic values that are today seen as the bedrock of the Federal Republic. Adenauer's own reputation was impaired by Spiegel affair and he announced that he would step down in the autumn of 1963. His successor was to be the Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard, who was the man widely credited as the father of the \"economic miracle\" of the 1950s and of whom great things were expected."]}, {"page": "Aylesbury Grammar School", "response": ["* Frederick Taylor, historian"]}, {"page": "Strategic bombing during World War II", "response": ["British historian Frederick Taylor asserts that \"all sides bombed each other's cities during the war.
