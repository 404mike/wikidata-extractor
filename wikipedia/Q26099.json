They began as a psychedelic rock group and diversified their sound through the use of instruments such as keyboards, like the Mellotron and harpsichord, sitar, and various reed instruments, and by incorporating jazz and improvisational techniques in their music. ", "Initially, they released three non-album singles, including \"Paper Sun\", \"Hole in My Shoe\", and \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\" in early and mid 1967. Their first full album Mr. Fantasy was released in December of that year, and while it was never released as a single, the track \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" from the album became a signature song for the band.  Dave Mason quit the band shortly after the release of the first album.  He rejoined briefly during the recording sessions for the band's self-titled second album, but was in and out of the group at various times over the next several years.  The three-piece Traffic (with Mason appearing in limited capacity) released one more album, 1969's Last Exit, which contained only one side of new studio material.  They disbanded in 1969 when Winwood co-founded the short-lived supergroup Blind Faith, with Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Ric Grech. They then reunited in 1970 to release the album John Barleycorn Must Die, their highest charting album in the U.S.  In 1971, the band reshuffled the lineup for the album The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys, with Capaldi moving to secondary percussionist and backing vocalist as the band added drummer Jim Gordon, percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah, and bassist Ric Grech to the official line-up.  For their next album, 1973's Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory, Gordon and Grech were replaced by members of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, Roger Hawkins and David Hood respectively.  For their next studio album, 1974's When the Eagle Flies, Capaldi had returned to  the drum kit, bassist Rosko Gee had replaced Hood, and Rebop Kwaku Baah had left.  The band broke up shortly thereafter. A partial reunion, with Winwood and Capaldi alongside several new musicians, took place in 1994.  In the intervening years Steve Winwood had a successful solo career, with several hit singles and albums during the 1980s.  Dave Mason had his own solo career that produced a few minor hit songs in the 1970s, played as a session musician with a number of bands, and was briefly a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1995 and Ringo Starr & His All Starr Band in 1997.  Jim Capaldi also had some minor solo hits in the 1970s in his native UK but was less successful abroad.  During the 1990s, Capaldi primarily worked as a songwriter, working with Santana and The Eagles.  Chris Wood did sporadic session work after the breakup of Traffic in 1974, and died in 1983.", "Traffic's singer, keyboardist, and guitarist Steve Winwood was the lead singer for the Spencer Davis Group at age 14. The Spencer Davis Group released four Top Ten singles and three Top Ten albums in the United Kingdom, as well as two Top Ten singles in the United States. Drummer/vocalist/lyricist Jim Capaldi and guitarist Dave Mason had both been in the Hellions and Deep Feeling, while woodwinds player Chris Wood came out of Locomotive.", "Following Winwood's recovery from peritonitis, Traffic's sixth studio album, Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory, released in 1973, met with a cold critical reception, but in sales it was another major hit. It was shortly followed by a major world tour, for which Muscle Shoals keyboardist Barry Beckett was added to the lineup.  The double live album On the Road was drawn from this tour. It broke the band's string of British flops by reaching number 40 in the UK Albums Chart.Traffic , Official Charts Company. Retrieved 11 August 2011. However, after the tour Winwood informed the Muscle Shoals trio that he was returning to a smaller lineup more like their original one, and their services were no longer needed. Meanwhile, Chris Wood's problems with drug use and depression were increasing.", "Steve Winwood embarked on a solo career, while Rosko Gee and Rebop Kwaku Baah joined German band Can. Kwaku Baah died on stage from a cerebral hemorrhage in Stockholm, Sweden in 1983, and Capaldi dedicated his solo album Fierce Heart to his memory. Chris Wood also died that year from pneumonia."]}, {"page": "Blind Faith", "response": ["In early 1969, Clapton and Winwood moved to Traffic's rehearsal cottage in Aston Tirrold, Berkshire. Baker turned up one day to sit in with them, and the three seriously considered forming a group. Clapton questioned letting Baker in the band, because he had promised Bruce that, if they were to work with one another again, all three of them would play. Moreover, Clapton didn't want to reunite with Cream barely nine weeks after the break-up, and also didn't want to deal with another band whose members had large reputations individually. Winwood ultimately persuaded Clapton to finalize Baker's inclusion in the line-up, arguing that Baker strengthened their musicianship and that it would be hard to find an equally talented drummer. Traffic was put on hold and the other remaining members, multi-instrumentalist Chris Wood and drummer / singer Jim Capaldi, were informed. Winwood later realised that Clapton would probably have rather had Capaldi in the new group instead of Baker."]}, {"page": "Steve Winwood", "response": ["Winwood met drummer Jim Capaldi, guitarist Dave Mason, and multi-instrumentalist Chris Wood when they jammed together at The Elbow Room, a club in Aston, Birmingham.

This allowed them to escape the city and develop their music.", "Winwood formed the supergroup Blind Faith in 1969 with Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Ric Grech. The band was short-lived, owing to Clapton's greater interest in Blind Faith's opening act Delaney & Bonnie & Friends; Clapton left the band at the tour's end. However, Baker, Winwood, and Grech stayed together to form Ginger Baker's Air Force. The line-up consisted of 3/4 of Blind Faith (without Clapton, who was replaced by Denny Laine), half of Traffic (Winwood and Chris Wood, minus Capaldi and Mason), plus musicians who interacted with Baker in his early days, including Phil Seamen, Harold McNair, John Blood, and Graham Bond."]}, {"page": "Harold McNair", "response": ["* Ginger Baker's Air Force, Ginger Baker's Air Force (Polydor, 1970), with Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, Denny Laine, Chris Wood, Graham Bond"]}, {"page": "Electric Ladyland", "response": ["*Chris Wood \u2013 flute on \"1983...
