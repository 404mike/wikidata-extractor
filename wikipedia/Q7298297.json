He now works as a commentator at BBC Radio Stoke.\nStarting his career at Stoke City, he did not make a first team appearance and so moved on to Stafford Rangers, and also worked as a teacher. He helped Rangers to lift the FA Trophy in 1972 and to top the Northern Premier League in 1971\u201372, before he returned to the Football League with Port Vale in July 1972. He scored 40 goals in 194 appearances for the club over the next five years, and was given the club's Player of the Year award in 1972\u201373. He returned to the non-league scene with Northwich Victoria in March 1977, and was appointed as the club's manager the following year. He achieved massive success with the club, winning the Cheshire Senior Cup and Staffordshire Senior Cup twice, the Alliance Premier League Cup once, and also picking up runner-up medals in the Northern Premier League, Northern Premier League Challenge Cup, and Cheshire Senior Cup. He returned to Port Vale in 1980, and worked there as a chief scout until 2011.

However Vale's form suffered, and Lee was replaced as manager by Roy Sproson in January. Vale finished the campaign one place above the relegation zone, though were seven points clear of the relegation zone. Horton played 46 games, scoring four goals. Vale missed out on promotion by just four points at the end of the 1974\u201375 season, as Horton hit thirteen goals in 47 games, leaving him one goal behind top-scorers Ray Williams and Terry Bailey. He hit four goals in 35 games in the 1975\u201376 season, including both of Vale's goals in a win over Millwall at Vale Park. Much to the disappointment of Vale supporters, he was sold to league rivals Brighton & Hove Albion in March 1976 for a fee of \u00a330,000.

Six wins were gained from the opening eight league games, though low attendances caused Lee to remark that \"the people here are not genuinely interested in league football\". Offered the management position at Shrewsbury Town, he rejected the offer as he believed the club \"lacked potential\" and that he had a \"feeling of loyalty towards the [Vale] players\". In mid-season he sold John James to Chester for \u00a35,000, Ray Harford to Colchester United for \u00a31,750, and Keith Lindsey to Gillingham for \u00a3750, whilst spending \u00a32,250 to bring 'pacey' striker John Woodward in from Walsall. Lee's team was criticized for foul play, particularly on 10 March, when Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy branded them \"a brutal and physical side\". In the FA Cup, West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood claimed that the Vale players attempted \"the most blatant calculated intimidation I have ever seen anywhere in the world\". Vale finished in sixth spot with 53 points, four short of promoted Notts County.

His team struggled with poor discipline \u2013 Rotherham manager Jimmy McGuigan claimed Vale were 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Midway through the season Sproson sold two more key players: striker Ray Williams went into non-league football for 'a small fee' and midfielder Colin Tartt joined Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. Sproson brought in Alan Lamb from Preston North End and Peter Sutcliffe from Stockport County for a combined outlay of \u00a38,000. Ultimately though, the loss of star midfielder Brian Horton to Brighton for \u00a330,000 in March 1976 was something Sproson proved unable to remedy.
