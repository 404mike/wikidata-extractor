Sellers followed this with the role of the perverted Austrian psychoanalyst Doctor Fritz Fassbender in Clive Donner's What's New Pussycat?, appearing alongside Peter O'Toole, Romy Schneider, Capucine, Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress. The film was the first screenwriting and acting credit for Woody Allen, and featured Sellers in a love triangle. Because of Sellers's poor health, producer Charles K.

The first film after their marriage, The Sandpiper, was poorly received but still became a commercially successful venture. According to Bragg, the films they made during the mid-1960s contained a lot of innuendos that referred directly to their private lives. Burton went on to star opposite Claire Bloom and Oskar Werner in The Spy Who Came In from the Cold (1965), a Cold War espionage story about a British Intelligence agent, Alec Leamas (Burton), who is sent to East Germany on a mission to find and expose a mole working within his organisation for an East German Intelligence officer, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck). Martin Ritt, the film's director and producer, wanted Burton's character to exhibit more anonymity, which meant no display of eloquent speeches or intense emotional moments. Bragg believed this decision worried Burton, as he had generated his reputation as an actor with those exact traits, and wondered how the film's would turn out. Ritt, a non-drinker, was displeased with Burton's drinking habits as he felt it \"lacked a certain discipline\" and expected the same level of commitment from him as everyone else during filming. In spite of their differences, Alpert notes that the film transpired well. Based on the 1963 novel of the same name by John le Carr\u00e9, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold garnered positive reviews, with Fernando F. Croce of Slant Magazine describing Burton's performance as more of \"tragic patsy than swashbuckler\" and believed his scenes with Werner \"have sharp doses of suspicion, cynicism and sadness\". Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader called the film \"Grim, monotonous, and rather facile\", he found Burton's role had \"some honest poignancy\". Variety thought Burton fitted \"neatly into the role of the apparently burned out British agent\". Burton also made a brief appearance the same year in Clive Donner's comedy What's New Pussycat? as a man who meets the womaniser Michael James (O'Toole) in a bar."]}, {"page": "The Pink Panther", "response": ["Romance of the Pink Panther was to have been the seventh film in the franchise, and written by Peter Sellers and Jim Moloney.PinkPantherMania.com, Romance of the Pink Panther - the Never Released Pink Panther Movie.

The basic plot was to involve Inspector Clouseau becoming smitten with a cat burglar called \"the Frog\", played by Pamela Stephenson. Two drafts of the screenplay were written before Sellers' death, each with different endings. Shortly after Sellers' death in July 1980, it was reported that Dudley Moore might play Clouseau, but Blake Edwards instead chose to introduce a new character in the series, rather than  recast the role of Clouseau.
