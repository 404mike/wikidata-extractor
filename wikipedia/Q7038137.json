In the episode of Doctor Who Confidential accompanying the episode \"Utopia\" (2007), where the same effect is used for the Master's regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided that this would be a common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\" (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in \"The End of Time\" (2010) during which Matt Smith took over the role as the Eleventh Doctor; in \"The Impossible Astronaut\" when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in \"Day of the Moon\" when a young girl regenerates; and in \"Let's Kill Hitler\" when Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) is shot and regenerates into River Song (Alex Kingston). \"The Night of the Doctor\" and \"The Day of the Doctor\" subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the Series 10 episode \"The Lie of the Land\", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test if Bill still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change bodies.", "In \"Let's Kill Hitler\", it is revealed that she regenerated into a toddler (Maya Glace-Green). This form later matured into Amy Pond's best friend, Mels (Nina Toussaint-White), who regenerated into her more widely known River Song (Alex Kingston) identity after being shot. In the aforementioned episode, post-regeneration, Melody is immune to a barrage of gunfire due to her surplus regenerative energy.  In that same episode, River Song used all her remaining regeneration energy to revive the Doctor; as Amy put it \"You're safe now. Apparently you used all your remaining regenerations in one go. You shouldn't have done that.\" She was hospitalised as a result and now no-longer possesses the ability to regenerate. In \"The Husbands of River Song\", it is revealed that River possesses an augmented lifespan in her final incarnation, but it is never made clear if this is a side-effect of her part-Time Lord physiology or something she obtained from other means."]}, {"page": "Companion (Doctor Who)", "response": ["| Alex KingstonEarlier incarnations of River Song (as Melody Pond) are played by Sydney Wade in \"The Impossible Astronaut\" / \"Day of the Moon\", and Maya Glace-Green and Nina Toussaint-White in \"Let's Kill Hitler\".
