A traditional magic square is a square array of numbers (almost always positive integers) whose sum taken in any row, any column, or in either diagonal is the same target number. A geomagic square, on the other hand, is a square array of geometrical shapes in which those appearing in each row, column, or diagonal can be fitted together to create an identical shape called the target shape.  As with numerical types, it is required that the entries in a geomagic square be distinct. Similarly, the eight trivial variants of any square resulting from its rotation and/or reflection are all counted as the same square. By the dimension of a geomagic square is meant the dimension of the pieces it uses. Hitherto interest has focused mainly on 2D squares using planar pieces, but pieces of any dimension are permitted.", "A well-known formula due to the mathematician \u00c9douard Lucas characterizes the structure of every 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 magic square of numbers.\"Alphamagic Squares\", thinkquest.org:Magic of Mathematics  Sallows, already the author of original work in this area,\"New advances with 4 \u00d7 4 magic squares\" by Lee Sallows had long speculated that the Lucas formula might contain hidden potential.Sallows, pp 3 and 91  This surmise was confirmed in 1997 when he published a short paper that examined squares using complex numbers, a ploy leading to a new theorem that correlated every 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 magic square with a unique parallelogram on the complex plane.\"The Lost Theorem\" by Lee Sallows The Mathematical Intelligencer Vol 19, No. 4, pp 51-4, 1997 Continuing in the same vein, a decisive next step was to interpret the variables in the Lucas formula as standing for geometrical forms, an outlandish idea that led directly to the concept of a geomagic square.Complex Projective 4-Space Where exciting things happen: Geomagic squares", "The point being that every numerical magic square can be understood as a one-dimensional geomagic square as above.
