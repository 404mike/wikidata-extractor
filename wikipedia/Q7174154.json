A year later the stadium plan was changed to become part of a \u00a346 million project by the Stadivarios group that would also include a 10,000-seat indoor arena. Peter Gadsby, however, the club's associate director at the time and head of the Miller Birch construction company, felt the project was both too ambitious and expensive and instead plans were drawn up by new Chairman Lionel Pickering to modernise and extend the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000, at a cost of \u00a310\u00a0million. However, despite signing a construction agreement with Taylor Woodrow, Gadsby suggested the club make a second attempt at securing the then-redeveloping Pride Park business park, settling with Derby City Council for a smaller site than previously agreed. On 21 February 1996, prior to a match against Luton Town at The Baseball Ground, the club announced to supporters the decision to move to a \u00a316\u00a0million state-of-the-art stadium for the start of the 1997\u201398 season.", "Derby City Council were paid \u00a31.8\u00a0million for the land and the club's four directors \u2013 Lionel Pickering, Peter Gadsby, Stuart Webb and John Kirkland each paid \u00a32.5\u00a0million towards a package deal to pay for the stadium.  The stadium itself was based upon Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium, which opened in 1995, though it had more than 30 amendments to the original plans. After toying with the idea of naming the new ground \"The New Baseball Ground\", it was settled that the club's new home would be called The Pride Park Stadium.", "Although the financing of the stadium's construction was carefully structured so that the club paid and owned the ground without encroaching on funds reserved for the development of the team, the club's eventual relegation from the top flight in 2002 saw it enter financial crisis and eventually it was temporarily entered into receivership by The Co-operative Bank, who instantly installed a new board composed of John Sleightholme, Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding, for the cost of \u00a31 each. Financial circumstances worsened as the debt spiralled to \u00a330\u00a0million plus and an unpopular refinancing scheme was put in place which saw the stadium sold to the \"mysterious\" Panama-based ABC Corporation and the club paying rent of \u00a31\u00a0million a year to play there, which local journalist Gerald Mortimer described as \"an affront ... to those who put everything into building [the ground]\". The ownership trio of Sleightholme, Keith and Harding were dubbed \"The Three Amigos\" and, after came under increasing criticism from the Derby's support, in the form of two separate supporters groups, the RamsTrust and the Rams Protest Group (RPG), they eventually sold out to a group of local businessmen, dubbed \"The League of Gentlemen\" by the local press, led by former board member Peter Gadsby, in April 2006. The Gadsby-led consortium returned Pride Park to club ownership. Three years later, Murdo Mackay, Jeremy Keith and finance director Andrew McKenzie were charged with taking a secret commission worth \u00a3440,625 from the club and were sentenced to a combined seven-and-a-half years in prison. As of August 2009, the club still owed \u00a315\u00a0million on the mortgage of the Pride Park Stadium which was later revealed to be due to be paid off in 2016.", "It was announced on 3 May 2013 that the first phase was to be launched after the last game of the 2012\u201313 season when Derby County faced Milwall. Located in the north east corner of the stadium and close to the DCFC megastore, the initial phase would provide a mixture of retail and restaurant units totalling 7,000sq.ft. The development was being undertaken jointly by the club and Cedar House Investments, part of former chairman Peter Gadsby's Ark Capital group of companies. John Vicars, chief operating officer at Derby County, welcomed the launch by saying, \"We see this development attracting perhaps a convenience retailer, and a restaurant to complement the facilities already available on Pride Park and to provide a greater choice. With the opening of the new multi-use sports arena and velodrome adjacent to the club, there will be even greater demand for these facilities.\" Peter Gadsby said: \"The area is already a proven destination for leading occupiers including Greggs, Frankie & Benny's, Subway and Starbucks. I am particularly keen that this scheme will add to the success of Pride Park and provide further amenities for the 10,000 people that are working in the area. It is good news that this phase of the development will create a further 25 jobs.\""]}, {"page": "John Sleightholme", "response": ["In early 2006, the club was facing a boardroom battle between Sleightholme and Keith. Following protests by the Rams Protest Group and RamsTrust, it didn't seem that Sleightholme and Keith would be chairman and chief executive respectively for much longer and, indeed, in April 2006, Sleightholme resigned, stating \"My position has been made untenable. Recently it has come to my attention that meetings have been held, important decisions taken and documents signed without my knowledge.
