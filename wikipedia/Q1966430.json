The club sent him on subsequent loan spells to Cheltenham Town, back to Tooting & Mitcham, Southampton and Colchester United, as he struggled to find a place in Reading's first team throughout his four-year stay at the Madejski. A final loan spell with Sheffield Wednesday resulted in a permanent move in 2012, where he went on to make 64 appearances and score 12 goals. Nottingham Forest signed him from Wednesday in 2014, where his 16 goals in 50 appearances attracted attention from West Ham United of the Premier League, who signed him in 2015, where he was deployed in a number of positions including right back, right midfielder and as a winger before eventually establishing himself as the club's main striker. On 23 August 2021, he became West Ham United's all-time top scorer in the Premier League.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["|2016|| Dimitri Payet|| Michail Antonio", "|2017|| Michail Antonio|| Manuel Lanzini"]}, {"page": "Nottingham Forest F.C.", "response": ["|2015|| Michail Antonio"]}, {"page": "Boleyn Ground", "response": ["In the 2,398th match played at the ground, with both sides looking to qualify for European football in the 2016\u201317 season, in front of a crowd of 34,907, West Ham took the lead in the tenth minute through Diafra Sakho, only for Manchester United to make the score 1\u20132 with two goals from Anthony Martial.
