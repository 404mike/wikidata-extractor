His paternal grandfather Sir Joshua Vanneck, 1st Baronet, had emigrated from the Netherlands in 1722 and had become a prominent London merchant. In 1816 Huntingfield succeeded his father both as second Baron Huntingfield and as Tory Member of Parliament for Dunwich, a seat he held until 1819. The barony of Huntingfield was an Irish peerage and did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords.\nLord Huntingfield married, firstly, Frances Catherine Arcedeckne, daughter of Chalenor Arcedeckne, in 1810. She died in 1815 and in 1817 he married, secondly, Lucy Anne Blois, daughter of Sir Charles Blois, 6th Baronet. He died in August 1844, aged 65, and was succeeded in his titles and estates by his son from his second marriage, Charles. Lady Huntingfield died in 1889.", "link_mentions": {}}}
