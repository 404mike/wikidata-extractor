Weaver was talented at other sports such as cricket and basketball, where he was also called up for county trials which he had to turn down due to football commitments. Weaver was selected to play in goal for Middlesex County and at just 13 years old was called up for England school boy trials where he was selected as first choice keeper. Weaver was first choice keeper for England school boys up to Under-21s.\nWeaver signed as a trainee at Leyton Orient F.C and turned professional with them at just 17 years old. At Leyton Orient F.C he had a loan spell at West Ham United and Leyton Orient F.C eventually struck a deal with Sunderland A.F.C on 1 July 1998 where Weaver was sold for \u00a3250,000.\nWeaver impressed Peter Reid as a young and upcoming goalkeeper, but was unable to break through into consistent first team football at Sunderland due to a string of injuries. Weaver eventually went on loan to Carlisle United on 5 August 1999 and this became a permanent four-year contract on 7 September 1999.\nWeaver made his debut for Carlisle United in the first game of the 99/00 season. In one of those frequent twists in football it was to be a home game against the club where he had turned professional, Leyton  Orient F.C. Weaver's natural ability (still being a young goal keeper) shone through and he was building a fine reputation as a solid shot stopper. He was voted United's Player of the season 99/00.\nThroughout Weaver's career he was blighted by injuries such as several knee injuries that required surgery and a broken jaw that required metal plates to be inserted. In 2003, Weaver went on loan to Northampton where he retired from the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luke (given name)", "response": ["*Luke Weaver (born 1979), English footballer", "*Luke Weaver (baseball) (born 1993), American baseball player"]}, {"page": "List of current Major League Baseball players by nationality", "response": ["| Luke Weaver || Arizona Diamondbacks || 27 || R || R || 6' 2\" || 183 || 8/21/1993 || 6 || 13"]}, {"page": "Florida State Seminoles baseball", "response": ["*Luke Weaver", "| 2014 || 1st || 27 || Luke Weaver || St. Louis Cardinals", "|Luke Weaver"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Sunderland A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Luke Weaver"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Luke Weaver"]}, {"page": "2014 Florida State Seminoles baseball team", "response": ["*7 - Luke Weaver - Junior", "::Luke Weaver", "*Luke Weaver", "*Luke Weaver (First Team)", "| 1st || 27 || Luke Weaver || Pitcher || St. Louis Cardinals"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 23 || GK || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Luke Weaver"]}, {"page": "2018 St. Louis Cardinals season", "response": ["In a good news report for the Cardinals #1 prospect on May 21, it was decided that disabled pitcher Alex Reyes will join the starting rotation instead of going to the bullpen, when he comes off the 60-day list on May 28. He has had three rehabilitation assignments, with his final fourth scheduled for May 24, at AAA-Memphis. He will be prepped to possibly start the May 29 game against the Milwaukee Brewers at their home park. He enjoyed great success in his previous assignment, going 7 innings at AA-Springfield, striking out 12. His final rehab start at AAA-Memphis on May 24, resulted in 13 strikeouts, including nine consecutively, in the win after 7 innings and 90 pitches, giving up only one hit, no runs, and two baserunners. He threw 23 scoreless innings across four rehab starts at four different levels. He struck out 44 and walked seven (82 batters faced), going 3\u20130. Reyes' major league start will be his first since Sept. 29, 2016. He went 4\u20131 with a 1.57 ERA in 12 appearances (five starts) in 2016, before injuring his right elbow in the spring of 2017. When Carlos Martinez returns from the DL, the team will have three high-powered arms: Reyes, Jack Flaherty, and Luke Weaver, fighting for two spots. Reyes, 23, will make his return start on Wednesday, May 30, the final series game against the Milwaukee Brewers, another team fighting for first-place in the NL Central. That game is televised only to active Facebook users, with no other networks allowed. The Cardinals are not planning any special restrictions on Reyes compared to any other of their pitchers. In delaying his return to the end of May by placing him on the 60-day DL, the club doesn't foresee having to shut him down for the post-season, if the Cardinals were to get there.", "Luke Gregerson (R) and Tyler Lyons (L) were activated from the DL on July 13. Gregerson missed 52 games, Lyons 31. Starter Luke Weaver and reliever John Brebbia were optioned. With off-days from the All-Star Game, the team won't need five starters until after the break. John Gant shifted from starter to bullpen.", "Before the third game against the Cubs on July 21, the Cardinals placed Carlos Martinez on the 10-day DL from a right oblique strain (backdated to July 20), from the last inning of his July 19 start. Recalled John Brebbia, a long reliever. Optioned Matt Bowman. Miles Mikolas activated from the paternity list, and added Luke Weaver as the 26th man for the doubleheader that day."]}, {"page": "2018 in baseball", "response": ["*December 5 \u2013 The St. Louis Cardinals traded first baseman Paul Goldschmidt to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for pitcher Luke Weaver, catcher Carson Kelly, minor league infielder Andy Young and a Competitive Balance Round B selection in the 2019 MLB Draft.Arizona Diamondbacks trade Paul Goldschmidt to St. Louis Cardinals.
