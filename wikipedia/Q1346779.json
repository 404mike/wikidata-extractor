Taylor (2012)  Oxford University Press p. 305 He also argued that the story of Jesus was based on the crucifixion of the Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls.Hall, Mark. Foreword to Allegro, John M. The Dead Sea Scrolls & the Christian Myth. Prometheus 1992, first published 1979, p. ix. Allegro's position was criticised sharply by Welsh historian Philip Jenkins, who wrote that Allegro relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them.Jenkins, Philip. Hidden Gospels. Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 180. Based on this and many other negative reactions to the book, Allegro's publisher later apologized for issuing the book and Allegro was forced to resign his academic post.The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls by Peter Flint and James VanderKam (2005)  T&T Clark pages 323\u2013325A History of the Middle East by Saul S.
