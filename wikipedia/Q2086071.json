He would also act as the expedition's meteorologist. Nimrods captain was another naval reserve officer, Rupert England; 23-year-old John King Davis, who would later make his own reputation as an Antarctic captain, was appointed chief officer at the last moment. Aeneas Mackintosh, a merchant navy officer from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), was originally second officer, but was later transferred to the shore party, being replaced as second officer by A.

Others in the shore party were the two surgeons, Alistair Mackay and Eric Marshall, Bernard Day the motor expert, and Sir Philip Brocklehurst, the subscribing member who had been taken on as assistant geologist."]}, {"page": "List of last survivors of historical events", "response": ["|Philip Brocklehurst"]}, {"page": "Philip Lee Brocklehurst", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Brocklehurst"]}, {"page": "Johnny Van Haeften", "response": ["Jonkheer John Henry Van Haeften is a descendant of the Dutch Old Master painter Nicolaes van Haeften.
