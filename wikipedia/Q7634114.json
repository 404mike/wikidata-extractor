Archaeologists Sue Hamilton and John Manley believed they were a part of \"...substantial landscape and social reconfigurations at the start of the first millennium [BCE]\",  that coincided with the change of three characteristics of British Bronze Age society: \"...disappearance of an archaeologically visible burial rite,\u00a0... increased deposition of prestige metalwork in rivers,\u00a0... and the demise of a middle Bronze Age settlement format of groups of round houses set within enclosures.\"Hamilton and Manley 2001. p. 07. They went on to note that \"Accrued place-value may have been important in the establishment of the earliest hillforts. These are often in locations with conspicuous traces of previous ritual monuments. This may have been a means of validating new social practices through making links with the past\".Hamilton and Manley 2001. p. 11. This idea was examined in more depth by ethnologist J. Forde-Johnston, who made note of how a number of Iron Age hillforts had been built close to earlier Bronze Age barrows. Commenting on the fact that both types of monument typically were constructed in high locations, he said, \"It is not surprising that the two features should coincide in several dozen cases.\" He added that it was possible that hillforts had been intentionally sited near barrows for defensive protection from the \"...sacred associations of the burial place.\"Forde-Johnston 1976. p. 103.", "Nonetheless, various archaeologists have called into question the defensive capacity of many hillforts. Using the case study of the Scratchbury hillfort in Wiltshire, Bowden and McOmish noted that \"The positioning of [the fort] suggests that it was not built for defence\" because \"a potential assailant is enabled to observe all the dispositions of the defence\", thereby leaving it particularly vulnerable to attackers.Bowden and McOmish 1989. p. 13. On a similar note, archaeologists Sue Hamilton and John Manley, after investigating the forts in south-east England, noted that for this region, \"It is noteworthy that most of the hillforts are univallate, and lack the in-depth perimeter elaboration which elsewhere has been ascribed a defensive role.\"Hamilton and Manley 2001. p. 34.", "Sue Hamilton and John Manley noted that archaeologists must keep in mind a phenomenological view of hillforts within their landscapes, noting that \"Hillforts provide a defined location from which to view the 'world'\u00a0... Such an experience of changing visual perspectives is largely lost in academic publication, yet it must have been a preeminent aspect of how hillfort builders and users described and understood hillforts.\""]}, {"page": "List of women anthropologists", "response": ["| Sue Hamilton"]}, {"page": "Women in archaeology", "response": ["Statistics show that women experience a glass ceiling in academic archaeology. Sue Hamilton, the director of the UCL Institute of Archaeology, noted  that 60\u201370% of the Institute's undergraduate and postgraduate students were women, as were the majority of its postdoctoral researchers. However, the proportion of women amongst permanent academic staff has never been more than 31%. Women are progressively further under-represented in each academic rank at the Institute: 38% of lecturers are female, 41% of senior lecturers, 17% of readers, and just 11% of professors. A 2016 study found a similar pattern in Australian universities. Whilst 41% of academic archaeologists were women, there was an imbalance in female representation in research fellowships (67%) compared to higher-ranked lecturing posts (31%). This study identified a \"two-tiered\" glass ceiling: women were less likely to obtain permanent tenure-track positions, and those that did also found it more difficult to advance to senior ranks. In 1994, around 15% of the archaeologists working in the top 30 academic institutions for the field were women."]}, {"page": "Barbara Bender", "response": ["Later she moved to the Department of Anthropology, UCL, being one of several material-culture focused anthropologists within the department in the late 1970s and early 1980s alongside Daniel Miller and John Gledhill.

Out of his involvement in the Leskernick Project, he became the principal butt of project sociologist Mike Willmore's very funny \"The Book and the Trowel,\" published in the Leskernick project book Stone Worlds, and the perceived victim of a \"top-down interpersonal project hierarchy,\" which challenged the egalitarian pretensions of what is otherwise considered a theoretically seminal archaeological project. He has directed and co-directed archaeological excavations for the Sussex Wildlife Trust and the Sussex Archaeological Society and set up and directed independent projects, involving the rescue excavation of prehistoric features exposed in the Selsey Raised Beach, West Sussex, and the analysis of later prehistoric stone finds from southeast England. He has ongoing academic interests in stone in prehistoric archaeology and landscape archaeology, recording strategies for Rapa Nui archaeology, Polynesian architecture, the faking of military antiques, and the use of period photographs in archaeological and historical research.
