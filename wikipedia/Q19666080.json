Swanberg and cinematographer Ben Richardson decided to shoot on 35 mm film rather than digitally, as most of Swanberg's previous films had been made. They decided to shoot on film, Richardson said, because \"there is a certain visual integrity to a film-derived image that is still lacking for me in most of the digitally-derived imagery that we see\". Although the film's dialogue was improvised, the actors rehearsed each scene before filming so that the scene could be blocked out due to the constraints of working with film rather than digital.", "The Austin Chronicle Kimberley Jones, on the other hand, felt that the story suffered because of the large cast and wrote that \"mostly it's just a toe listlessly pushing dirt around\". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune praised Ben Richardson's cinematography and \"natural tone\" of the acting but felt that the dialogue was lacking, giving the film 2 out of 4 stars. The San Francisco Chronicle G. Allen Johnson also criticized the \"forced and uninteresting\" dialogue and thought that the story and characters felt \"phony\". The Boston Globe critic Ty Burr found the film uninsightful, writing that \"Swanberg is tilling soil here that has been churned since humanity began\", and felt that the plot focused too much on Tim rather than Lee.  Chris Nashawaty gave the film a C+ grade in Entertainment Weekly, dismissing it as \"Joe Swanberg's latest meditation on aging-hipster malaise\"."]}, {"page": "Richardson, Ben", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Richardson"]}, {"page": "Ben Richardson (cinematographer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Richardson"]}, {"page": "Yellowstone (American TV series)", "response": ["| Ben Richardson (for \"Daybreak\")"]}, {"page": "1922 (2017 film)", "response": ["Principal photography for 1922 began in Vancouver with cinematographer Ben Richardson to take advantage of the tax credit given to films shot in Canada. Due to harvesting season, a farmhouse with a cornfield could not be found in time before filming, resulting in the corn depicted in the film being made using corn props from China, computer graphics (CG), and shots taken in Boort, Australia. A farmhouse located in the city of Langley was eventually used during the shooting of the project, with filming concluding in Boort."]}]}}
