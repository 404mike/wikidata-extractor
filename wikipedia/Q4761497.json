Also leaving the show during this period were script editor Tom Ford and the then boss of BBC Two, Kim Shillinglaw. His behaviour was considered problematic, most particularly with Clark, after a source claimed that Evans felt undermined by her during a meeting he attended, when she pointed out that he still had more films to complete than just the one he had done with Jenson Button, while another source revealed that the choice of Matt LeBlanc being Evans' co-host was down to Clark and not Evans, who simply uttered when hearing the choice from her: \"He's old hat, what do we want him for?\" On his Twitter account, after hearing the news of Clark's sudden departure, comedian Bob Mortimer commented on whether Tony Hall would live up to a promise to clamp down on BBC stars that were abusing their power following the stories emerging on Evans' behaviour. Rumours also emerged that LeBlanc was clashing with his co-host behind the scenes because they did not get on well, to the point that he threatened to leave unless Evans went, but these were dismissed by him as being rubbish during an interview with Radio Times, who claimed they were made by the \"ruthlessness\" of British media."]}]}}
