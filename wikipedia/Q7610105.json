His na\u00efvety and inexperience often made him the butt of pranks and jokes by other members of the watch. He took a liking to Firewoman Kate Stevens and visited her at her house, but was warned by Hallam to stop bothering her. After Colin sent the pump to the wrong address on a 'shout' (which was fortunately a hoax), Hallam extended Colin's probationary period, much to the ire of Colin's mother. Colin became a hero for the first time soon after this, when he saved another firefighter from falling down a lift shaft at a hotel fire. He graduated to full status early in Series 5. He married Zoe, whom he met during a 'shout', (rescuing a bird from a cage), despite her walking out on him after he took her to a football match on their first date. Colin was invalided out of the Brigade after his legs were crushed in Series 6."]}, {"page": "King Alfred's Academy", "response": ["Alumni include: computer scientist Professor Dave Cliff; spy novelist John Gardner; actor/author Stephen North; jockey Lester Piggott; neuroscientist Professor Anil Seth; Anna Yearley OBE, Executive Director of human-rights nonprofit Reprieve; and Christopher Ricks literary critic and scholar."]}, {"page": "Steve North", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stephen North"]}, {"page": "North (surname)", "response": ["* Stephen North (born 1965), British actor"]}, {"page": "North, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen North"]}]}}
