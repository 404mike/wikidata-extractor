Most of the early producers and DJs still produce and play in today's drum and bass scene, forming something of a jungle 'old guard'. Some important early artists such as A Guy Called Gerald with his seminal early jungle LP (\"Black Secret Technology\") and 4hero (\"Mr Kirk's Nightmare\") later developed their own styles, leaving the drum and bass mainstream.", "Since the term jungle was so closely related to the ragga  influenced sound, DJs and producers who did not incorporate reggae elements began to adopt the term \"drum and bass\" to differentiate themselves and their musical styles.

Perhaps the first track to explicitly use the term \"drum and bass\" to refer to itself was released in 1993.

However, alongside other key producers in the scene, LTJ Bukem, arguably the single most influential figure behind the style, is especially noted for disliking the term, owing to the implication that other forms of drum and bass are not intelligent. From this period on, drum and bass would maintain the unity of a relatively small musical culture, but one characterised by a competing group of stylistic influences.
