He received his PhD from the University of Sussex in 1994, supervised by Prof. John D. Barrow in the Astronomy Centre.\nWands has published numerous research papers on cosmology, the physics of the early universe and the origin of cosmic structure. Wands' research involves investigation of primordial fluctuations in the density and metric of spacetime. He proposed the curvaton model for the origin of cosmic structure, with David H. Lyth in 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Portsmouth", "response": ["* David Wands, Professor of Cosmology at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation"]}, {"page": "Petersfield", "response": ["Surgeon William Cowper (c. 1666 \u2013 1709), who gave his name to Cowper's gland, was born in Petersfield.
