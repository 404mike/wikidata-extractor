Her mother Sybil Thomas and Merthyr Ironmaster's wife, Rose Mary Crawshay, were both well connected suffragists whose work is well documented. Millicent Mackenzie and to a lesser extent Amy Dillwyn are remembered more for connections outside the sphere of women's suffrage, but were both important Welsh activists for the cause. The majority of suffragists either working in Wales or Welsh suffragists who were active outside the country are many but poorly documented. Alice Abadam, a renowned speaker and activist, was the daughter of the High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire. She later became the chairperson of the Federated Council of Suffrage Movements. Rachel Barrett, a science teacher from south Wales, rose to prominence within the WSPU and was chosen by Annie Kenney to assist in running the WSPU national campaign from 1912. She was also assistant editor of The Suffragette."]}, {"page": "Edward Hamlyn Adams", "response": ["Edward Abadam (1809\u20131875) quarrelled with his brother William (1814\u20131851).

In 1911, a small group of 'tres feministe et tres orthodoxe' women founded a Catholic Women's Suffrage Society to expressly secure equality of suffrage for men and women, and to alleviate the 'hard and dehumanizing' workplaces affecting millions of working women. The foundation of the group was controversial with some criticising its lack of universality and others seeing voting rights as too controversial to be supported by people of the Catholic faith. Crawford did not support the argument that seeking votes for women was 'essentially anti-religious'. The group however came to a compromise with activists from the other suffrage organisations, not excluding them but also not allowing them to represent CWSS  at any militant activities. Militancy and arson, window-smashing and other criminal actions for women's rights divided Catholic opinion, especially when worship was disrupted to protest forced feeding of prisoners. But other Catholic activists, like Alice Abadam, urged church women to move from small charitable activities to help the poor to turn to women's suffrage campaigning to \"influence the lives of millions of their poor and unprotected sisters for the good.\""]}, {"page": "Abadam, Alice", "response": ["#redirectAlice Abadam"]}]}}
