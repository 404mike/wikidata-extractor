He was the inventor of a precision boring machine that could bore cast iron cylinders, such as cannon barrels  and piston cylinders used in the steam engines of James Watt. His boring machine has been called the first machine tool.  He also developed a blowing device for blast furnaces that allowed higher temperatures, increasing their efficiency, and helped sponsor the first iron bridge in Coalbrookdale. He is notable for his method of cannon boring, his techniques at casting iron, and his work with the government of France to establish a cannon foundry.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
