He won in 2000, 2001 and 2003, and did not contest the 2002 final, pulling out with injury, to give Mark Constable his only national title, with a walkover. Haughton lost the 2004 title to rising star Aamir Ghaffar, in front of his home crowd in Manchester, in a disappointing final. Shortly afterwards Haughton announced his retirement; it seems he had been suffering from a niggling hip injury, which had affected his performance in the final.\nOn Friday 2 February 2001, at the English Nationals in Burgess Hill, Colin achieved the dubious distinction of being the first English player to be 'yellow carded' by the umpire. His unfortunate offence was to have left his mobile telephone in his bag, courtside, switched on. The umpire was not amused when it rang during the game. At the time Colin said \"I don't know who was ringing. I didn't realise I had left the phone in my bag.\"\nOne of only a handful of men to win three or more National singles titles, Haughton remains one of the most underrated modern English players. Apart from his three National titles, his win over Singapore's Ronald Susilo in the Commonwealth Games helped England to a team Gold.\nHe currently works as a coach.\nTournament wins:\n\n1999: US Open", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denton, Greater Manchester", "response": ["* Colin Haughton, is an English badminton singles player from Denton who held the No. 1 position in the national rankings and reached as high as 19th in the world rankings"]}, {"page": "Nikhil Kanetkar", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "England at the 2002 Commonwealth Games", "response": [":James Anderson, Simon Archer, Robert Blair, Anthony Clark, Mark Constable, Gail Emms, Joanne Goode, Tracey Hallam, Colin Haughton, Donna Kellogg, Julia Mann, Ella Miles, Nathan Robertson & Sara Sankey, team"]}, {"page": "English National Badminton Championships", "response": ["| Colin Haughton", "| Colin Haughton", "| Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Roman Spitko", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "U.S. Open Badminton Championships", "response": ["|  Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Scottish Open (badminton)", "response": ["| Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Iceland International", "response": ["| Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Slovak International", "response": ["| Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Welsh International", "response": ["|  Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Slovenian International", "response": ["|  Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Australian Open (badminton)", "response": ["|  Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Canada Open", "response": ["| Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "Imay Hendra", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "1996 Thomas & Uber Cup", "response": ["| James AndersonPeter BushDarren HallColin HaughtonChris HuntPeter KnowlesJulian RobertsonNathan Robertson"]}, {"page": "Haughton (name)", "response": ["* Colin Haughton (born 1972), English badminton singles player from Denton near Manchester"]}, {"page": "Badminton at the 2002 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Colin Haughton ||  Ronald Susilo || 5-7, 7-4, 7-0, 0-7, 7-3"]}, {"page": "1998 English National Badminton Championships", "response": ["|Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "1999 English National Badminton Championships", "response": ["|Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "2000 English National Badminton Championships", "response": ["|Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "2001 English National Badminton Championships", "response": ["|Colin Haughton"]}, {"page": "2002 English National Badminton Championships", "response": ["Julia Mann won her seventh singles title putting her just one behind Gillian Gilks on the all-time list.
