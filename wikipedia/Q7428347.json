Glowing yet somber, they do little to engage readers' emotions in Daniel's mild adventure.\"  Patricia Manning in here review for School Library Journal said that \"Horowitz's quiet text reflects the moonlit awe of this ageless pattern, and Kiesler's luminous oils capture freeze-frame moments in perfect step\""]}, {"page": "Emma Chichester Clark", "response": ["* The Orchard Book of Grimm's Fairy Tales by Saviour Pirotta. 2011"]}, {"page": "The Orchard Book of First Greek Myths", "response": ["The Orchard Book of First Greek Myths is a bestselling children's book by Saviour Pirotta, illustrated by Jan Lewis.
