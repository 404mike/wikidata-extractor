She participated in the adoption of the 'historical standpoint' method of research, a shift in art criticism that emerged in the early twentieth century. She was influenced by Giovanni Morelli and his methods of connoisseurship, assembling subtle clues and recognition of personal technique, the artist's 'hand', to determine a work's provenance and creators. Ffoulkes' own techniques involved the investigation of historical documentation, which came to be used by many modern art historians in support of their conclusions.Ffoulkes' works include contributions to the Encyclopedia Britannica, instruction on scientific methodologies for analysis of artworks, the first major study of Vincenzo Foppa (c. 1427\u20131515), and contributions to the journals Repertorium f\u00fcr Kunstwissenschaft and Rassegna d\u2019arte.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Austen Henry Layard", "response": ["On this subject he was a disciple of his friend Giovanni Morelli, whose views he embodied in his revision of Franz Kugler's Handbook of Painting, Italian Schools (1887). He wrote also an introduction to Constance Jocelyn Ffoulkes's translation of Morelli's Italian Painters (1892\u20131893), and edited that part of Murray's Handbook of Rome (1894) which deals with pictures. In 1887 he published, from notes taken at the time, a record of his first journey to the East, entitled Early Adventures in Persia, Susiana and Babylonia. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing thought it 'one of the most interesting books' vowing to 'read it again some day'.Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.318. An abbreviation of this work, which as a book of travel is even more delightful than its predecessors, was published in 1894, shortly after the author's death, with a brief introductory notice by Lord Aberdare. Layard also from time to time contributed papers to various learned societies, including the Huguenot Society, of which he was first president."]}, {"page": "Giovanni Morelli", "response": ["Morelli's connoisseurship was developed to a high degree by Bernard Berenson, who met Morelli in 1890.
