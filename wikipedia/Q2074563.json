Guile) is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme and is the main character. Van Damme's line in the film, \"Are you man enough to fight with me?\", is taken from Street Fighter II and its follow-ups. His character is given the rank of Colonel. In this live adaption, Guile is commanding the A.N. (this film's version of the United Nations) forces as he searches for General M. Bison. His motivation for searching for Bison is not to avenge Charlie's death, but to end Bison's corrupt organization and to rescue Charlie, although he receives a great deal of help from Ryu and Ken to find Bison's base, and is aided in his mission by Chun-Li, Cammy White, T. Hawk, Balrog, E. Honda and Zangief. Jean-Claude Van Damme's hair, while blonde, lacked the hairstyle from the games, and even though the character was portrayed as American, Van Damme's Belgian accent was very noticeable, which implies that he is French-American. Van Damme was approached to reprise the role in the reboot, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, but ultimately did not appear."]}, {"page": "X-Men vs. Street Fighter", "response": ["* Cammy White"]}, {"page": "Sonya Blade", "response": ["*Cammy White (Street Fighter) and Sarah Bryant (Virtua Fighter)"]}, {"page": "List of SNK vs. Capcom characters", "response": ["* Cammy White (\u30ad\u30e3\u30df\u30a3)"]}, {"page": "Street Fighter (1994 film)", "response": ["In the Southeast Asian nation of Shadaloo, civil war has erupted between the forces of drug lord-turned General M.
