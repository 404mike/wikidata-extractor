He joined Port Vale in November 2014, and was loaned out to Boston United in August 2015, but left Vale in January 2016 without making a first team appearance. He moved on to Moldovan side Zaria B\u0103l\u021bi \u2013 winning the Moldovan Cup in 2016 \u2013 and Georgian side Zugdidi, before he returned to England in August 2017 to sign with Dover Athletic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FA Youth Cup", "response": ["| Aziz Deen-Conteh"]}, {"page": "List of foreign football players in Super League Greece", "response": ["*Aziz Deen-Conteh \u2013 Ergotelis 2013\u20132014"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 FA Youth Cup", "response": ["|LB ||5 ||  Aziz Deen-Conteh  || ", "|LB ||5 ||  Aziz Deen-Conteh"]}, {"page": "Aziz Deen Conteh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Aziz Deen-Conteh"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale opened November with three points at Colchester United; Neal saved a first-half penalty before Marshall and Daniel secured the goals in a 2\u20131 win. The search for talented young players continued, with Aziz Deen-Conteh and Enoch Andoh both joining the club on a trial basis. The clash with Rochdale on 15 November came amidst a defensive crisis as Streete was recalled from his loan and both Duffy and McGivern were suspended. The positive results kept coming however, as Vale moved into the top half of the table with a 1\u20130 win. Former Chelsea left-back Aziz Deen-Conteh then signed a deal with the club until 2017. Leaving the club, though only on a 28-day loan, was goalkeeper Sam Johnson, who went to Conference Premier side Alfreton Town. Not long after their FA Cup triumph at Vale Park, Milton Keynes Dons hosted the Vale and ran out 1\u20130 following a sending off to Chris Lines. Another two long-term prospects were then added in the form of Ghana youth international Enoch Andoh, who signed an 18-month contract, and former Manchester City striker Alex Nimely.
