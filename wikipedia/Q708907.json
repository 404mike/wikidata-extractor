One of the earliest examples is the fa\u00e7ade of Guildhall, London (1788\u20131789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by William Hodges, and William and Thomas Daniell from about 1795.

Thomas then began planning an ambitious tour of northern India, possibly inspired by the wealth of picturesque scenery indicated in William Hodges's collection of aquatints, Select Views in India (1785\u20138). In August 1789, Thomas and William set off up-river past Murshidabad to Bhagalpur, where they stayed with Samuel Davis (1760\u20131819), an employee of the East India Company and a skilled amateur artist.
