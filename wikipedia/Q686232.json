The right-hand or future value asymptote of the function is approached much more gradually by the curve than the left-hand or lower valued asymptote. This is in contrast to the simple logistic function in which both asymptotes are approached by the curve symmetrically. It is a special case of the generalised logistic function.

The Gompertz function reduced a significant collection of data in life tables into a single function.  It is based on the assumption that the mortality rate increases exponentially as a person ages.

In a protected environment where external causes of death are rare (laboratory conditions, low mortality countries, etc.), the age-independent mortality component is often negligible. In this case the formula simplifies to a Gompertz law of mortality. In 1825, Benjamin Gompertz proposed an exponential increase in death rates with age."]}, {"page": "Benjamin gompertz", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin Gompertz "]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Benjamin Gompertz, mathematician"]}, {"page": "List of Jewish mathematicians", "response": ["* Benjamin Gompertz (1779\u20131865), mathematician"]}, {"page": "Griffith Davies", "response": ["In 1829 the directors of the East India Company submitted the documents concerning the Bombay military fund for his investigation and report, and from this period up to 1851 he was constantly consulted regarding the various Indian funds.
