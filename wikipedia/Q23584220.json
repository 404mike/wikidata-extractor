She participated in several premiere performances and recordings by the Zorian Quartet.\nFor many years, she taught viola at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1971, she pointed out to musicologist and violist Martin Jarvis, one of her students, some problems with the published editions of the Bach cello suites. That observation eventually led to his hypothesis that they had been composed by Anna Magdalena Bach and not, as commonly supposed, by her husband Johann Sebastian Bach.She wrote a book designed for beginning viola students, The First-Year Viola Method.Her name is inscribed in the Book of Remembrance in the Musicians' Chapel at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of violists", "response": ["* Winifred Copperwheat (190576), performer, teacher"]}, {"page": "Winifred", "response": ["* Winifred Copperwheat (19051976), English violist"]}, {"page": "Viola concerto", "response": ["**Viola Concerto (1955), composed for and dedicated to Winifred Copperwheat"]}, {"page": "Martin Jarvis (conductor)", "response": ["He won a scholarship to the Welsh College of Music, Cardiff, where he studied violin under Garfield Phillips, concertmaster of the BBC Welsh Orchestra.

She often used ostinato-like repetition and alternation in her works, often of a percussive character. These characteristics are apparent in the Viola Sonata (premiered in March 1946 by Winifred Copperwheat and Antony Hopkins) and the Barbaric Dance Suite for piano (1949; premiered in November 1950 by Margaret Kitchin).The Independent, Obituary of Margaret Kitchin, 1 July 2008 There is also a Suite for clarinet and piano (1943), a Sinfonia da camera for strings (1947; commissioned by a close friend, Michael Tippett; premiered by Walter Goehr,) and a Ballet Suite (1950).
