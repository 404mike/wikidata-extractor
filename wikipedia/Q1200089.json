The following season, he formed an understanding with John Richards that teammate Derek Parkin described as the \"best partnership in Europe\", which helped to boost Dougan's scoring tally and make Wolves one of the top teams in the country during the early 1970s. They qualified for the UEFA Cup, and Dougan scored a hat-trick in a first round 7\u20131 aggregate victory over Portuguese side Acad\u00e9mica. Wolves then progressed past Dutch side Den Haag by the same score, beat East German side Carl Zeiss Jena 4\u20130 on aggregate, and overcome Italian giants Juventus 3\u20132 on aggregate before knocking out Ferencv\u00e1ro of Hungary 4\u20133 on aggregate to reach the final.
