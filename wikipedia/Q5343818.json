The first phase, the East Wing Project designed by Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones, opened to the public in 2004. This provided a new ground level entrance from Trafalgar Square, named in honour of Sir Paul Getty. The main entrance was also refurbished, and reopened in September 2005. Possible future projects include a \"West Wing Project\" roughly symmetrical with the East Wing Project, which would provide a future ground level entrance, and the public opening of some small rooms at the far eastern end of the building acquired as part of the swap with the National Portrait Gallery.

London: Spon Press/Taylor and Francis. they are inspired by traditional Scottish tower houses. The location on the campus was carefully selected to enhance the landscape, with the Round Tower placed at a slight curve in the river and the Square Tower at the end of an existing paved terrace. The construction is of concrete blocks covered by an external finish of harling, common on Scottish castles, and tinted pink as at Craigievar Castle in Aberdeenshire (approximately 27 miles/43\u00a0km to the west of the campus). In the seven-storey Round Tower each floor comprises a single apartment consisting of five student bedrooms and a kitchen with an inner \"drum\", originally clad in wood, containing two shared toilets. A semi-circular common area with balcony is found on the top floor with a roof terrace giving almost 360-degree views over the surrounding landscape. The five-storey Square Tower is similar, with a rectangular common area and roof terrace on the top floor. The cost of design and construction was twice as great as for a typical university hall of residence at the time, and paid by a donation from an anonymous benefactor.Glancey, J. (16 February 1994).
