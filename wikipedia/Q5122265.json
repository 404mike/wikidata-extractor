Fitzgerald acted in a popular Gaiety Girl show beginning in 1894 and was filmed in the role for an Edison short during the early film era in 1896 in a self-titled short film shot by Thomas Edison's film company. She did not appear in films again until 1914 where she signed with the Vitagraph company and was quite popular in feature films and her own series of Cissy short films. Very little of Fitzgerald's silent material survives today but she can be seen in a comic backup role in the 1928 Lon Chaney vehicle Laugh, Clown, Laugh.\nFitzgerald later claimed to having been the first woman ever filmed in motion pictures when she went to the Edison labs at New Jersey in 1896 to shoot 50 feet of film. This claim is disputed as Annabelle Whitford had been filmed in 1894 by Edison engineer W. K. L. Dickson and the Lumiere's in France were shooting motion pictures, including men and women coming and going from a factory, by 1896. \n\nFitzgerald married Oliver Mark Tucker and had two children, a son and a daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1896 in film", "response": ["*Cissy Fitzgerald as an actress in 50 feet of actuality film of Fitzgerald by Edison; presumably elements from the 1894 play The Gaiety Girl"]}, {"page": "Laugh, Clown, Laugh", "response": ["*Cissy Fitzgerald as Giacinta"]}, {"page": "May 1941", "response": ["*Died: Cissy Fitzgerald, 68, English-American vaudeville performer"]}, {"page": "Flames (1926 film)", "response": ["* Cissy Fitzgerald as Mrs. Edgerton"]}, {"page": "The Painted Angel", "response": ["*Cissy Fitzgerald - Ma Hudler"]}, {"page": "Patricia Gets Her Man", "response": ["* Cissy Fitzgerald as Duchess Banning"]}, {"page": "Du Barry, Woman of Passion", "response": ["*Cissy Fitzgerald - Bit role"]}, {"page": "The Diplomats (film)", "response": ["* Cissy Fitzgerald The Countess "]}, {"page": "Women Love Diamonds", "response": ["* Cissy Fitzgerald as Mrs. Ray"]}, {"page": "No Babies Wanted", "response": ["*Cissy Fitzgerald - Woman from Orphanage"]}, {"page": "Cornered (1924 film)", "response": ["* Cissy Fitzgerald as Lola Mulvaney"]}, {"page": "The Crown of Lies", "response": ["*Cissy Fitzgerald as Leading Lady"]}, {"page": "Women's Wares", "response": ["* Cissy Fitzgerald as Mrs. Frank Stanton"]}, {"page": "Two Flaming Youths", "response": ["Two Flaming Youths is a lostAmerican Silent Feature Film Survival Database: Two Flaming Youths 1927 American silent comedy film directed by John Waters and written by John W.
