Fitzgerald acted in a popular Gaiety Girl show beginning in 1894 and was filmed in the role for an Edison short during the early film era in 1896 in a self-titled short film shot by Thomas Edison's film company. She did not appear in films again until 1914 where she signed with the Vitagraph company and was quite popular in feature films and her own series of Cissy short films. Very little of Fitzgerald's silent material survives today but she can be seen in a comic backup role in the 1928 Lon Chaney vehicle Laugh, Clown, Laugh.\nFitzgerald later claimed to having been the first woman ever filmed in motion pictures when she went to the Edison labs at New Jersey in 1896 to shoot 50 feet of film. This claim is disputed as Annabelle Whitford had been filmed in 1894 by Edison engineer W. K. L. Dickson and the Lumiere's in France were shooting motion pictures, including men and women coming and going from a factory, by 1896. \n\nFitzgerald married Oliver Mark Tucker and had two children, a son and a daughter.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
