He scored 105 goals in 395 league and cup games during a twelve-year career in the Football League, most of which was spent in the Fourth Division.\nHe began his career at Stourbridge before joining Shrewsbury Town in 1970. Two years later he joined Torquay United via Telford United. After 54 goals in 215 league and cup games for Torquay, he signed with Port Vale in July 1982. He played eight games of their promotion winning campaign, before transferring to Aldershot in July 1983. Leaving the \"Shots\" in 1984, he then spent a season each at Fourth Division sides Rochdale, Burnley, Peterborough United, and Cambridge United, before moving into non-league football with Kettering Town and Aylesbury United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["Promotion was eventually achieved with a third-place finish in 1982\u201383. This was despite McGrath selling Mark Chamberlain and Mark Harrison to Stoke for \u00a3100,000. He made five free signings: John Ridley (a former Valiant), Wayne Cegielski (Wrexham), Les Lawrence (Torquay United), Steve Waddington (Walsall), and Barry Siddall (Sunderland). He further sold Neville Chamberlain to Stoke for \u00a340,000, bringing in burly striker Bob Newton from Hartlepool United for \u00a315,000. Vale went top of the table despite a goalkeeping crisis which saw Barry Siddall, Neville Southall, Neil McAdam, and Andy Poole between the sticks at different points in the campaign. He bought striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, whilst letting Ernie Moss go to Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee after judging him to be too old to be of any further use. With 34 goals conceded, Vale had the best defensive record in the Football League."]}, {"page": "List of Torquay United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Les Lawrence||19"]}, {"page": "Vic Halom", "response": ["Halom moved into management in the early 1980s managing Bergs\u00f8y IL in Norway. He later achieved great success with Barrow taking them back into the Vauxhall Conference in 1983\u201384. This led to him being appointed Rochdale manager at the end of the season. Halom began with a mass clear out, many of the incomers being ex-Oldham players. The side struggled to gel at first but things markedly improved when the under-performing record signing Les Lawrence was sold and replaced by proven goalscorer Steve Taylor late in 1984. For the next calendar year Rochdale showed promotion-winning form and earned a third round FA Cup tie with Manchester United."]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["Another clear-out left just eleven professionals on the books for the 1982\u201383 season. Four of the more important newcomers were John Ridley, Wayne Cegielski, Les Lawrence and Steve Waddington. In August, Mark Chamberlain and Mark Harrison were sold to rival's Stoke for a combined fee of \u00a3180,000. There was little option to sell due to the financial situation, though McGrath's plans were heavily disrupted. As a result, five players made their d\u00e9buts on the opening game of the season. A bold attempt to sign Mick Channon failed, forcing McGrath to settle for dedicated forward Bob Newton. The season finished with promotion, third place with seven points to spare.
