Christmas was born to a British family in London. He was the son of film and television actor Eric Christmas. He emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada with his family, and was there at the age of 2 years that hemophilia was diagnosed at the Hospital for Sick Children. The family returned to London in 1952 to visit their relatives, and during the trip Stephen was admitted to hospital. A sample of his blood was sent to the Oxford Haemophilia Centre in Oxford, where Rosemary Biggs and Robert Gwyn Macfarlane discovered that he was not deficient in Factor VIII, which is normally decreased in classic hemophilia, but a different protein, which received the name Christmas factor in his honour (and later Factor IX). Stephen was dependent on blood and plasma transfusions, and was infected with HIV in the period during which blood was not routinely screened for this virus. He became an active worker for the Canadian Hemophilia Society and campaigned for transfusion safety ever since getting infected, but developed AIDS and died from it in 1993."]}, {"page": "1907 in science", "response": ["* June 26 \u2013 Robert Gwyn Macfarlane (died 1987), British hematologist."]}, {"page": "1979 in science", "response": ["* Robert Gwyn Macfarlane publishes Howard Florey: The Making of a Great Scientist."]}, {"page": "1984 in science", "response": ["* Robert Gwyn Macfarlane publishes Alexander Fleming: The Man and the Myth."]}, {"page": "1952 in science", "response": ["* December \u2013 Robert Gwyn Macfarlane and colleagues publish the first identification of Haemophilia B."]}, {"page": "Heinz Wolff", "response": ["Wolff worked in haematology at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford under Robert Gwyn Macfarlane, where he invented a machine for counting patients' blood cells, before joining the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit at Llandough Hospital near Cardiff.

As other clotting factors had been discovered by the time of Ratnoff's encounter with his patient, Hageman factor became known as factor XII.

She worked closely with Robert Gwyn Macfarlane at the Radcliffe Infirmary and Churchill Hospital in Oxford, where she studied coagulation disorders, particularly haemophilia.", "In 1944, after holding junior posts in London hospitals, Biggs moved to Oxford, where she joined the Radcliffe Infirmary's pathology department as a graduate assistant. She initially studied crush syndrome and the variability in haematological tests, under the mentorship of Robert Gwyn Macfarlane. She then researched the formation and breakdown of blood clots (coagulation and fibrinolysis), and earned an MD and a gold medal from the University of London with her thesis on the clotting enzyme prothrombin in 1949. In 1952, she designed a new test, the thromboplastin generation test, for detecting defects in the blood of people with haemophilia. The same year, Biggs and Macfarlane's group discovered a previously unknown clotting enzyme, factor IX, which they originally named Christmas factor. They also coined the term Christmas disease (now known as haemophilia B) for patients with factor IX deficiencies, as distinguished from classical haemophilia (now known as haemophilia A), wherein there is a deficiency in factor VIII. The new factor and disease were named after Stephen Christmas, the first patient discovered by the group at Oxford to be deficient in factor IX."]}, {"page": "Katharine Dormandy", "response": ["After her appointment at the Royal Free, Dormandy set about establishing a haemophilia centre at the hospital. The service initially ran out of a caravan parked outside the hospital that had been donated by the Haemophilia Society. Dormandy also campaigned for the creation of a special boarding school for haemophiliacs, since many were forced to miss large amounts of school. Her plans for a dedicated school did not eventuate, but her work led to the adoption of treatment facilities at Treloar School, a school for the disabled, which then attracted more haemophiliac students. By 1970, the haemophilia centre at the Royal Free had expanded to utilise the veranda of an existing ward; although its premises were located in a caravan and a veranda, it was designated an \"international centre\" by the World Federation of Haemophilia. Dormandy was appointed a university reader in 1970 and was awarded a Doctor of Medicine for a thesis on von Willebrand disease. In 1977, she was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and received the inaugural gold medal of the Haemophilia Society, named for Robert Gwyn Macfarlane."]}, {"page": "Coen Hemker", "response": ["Hemker subsequently started his specialist training to become a pediatrician but stopped as he preferred doing research. He was then hired as researcher at the hemostasis and thrombosis department of Leiden University. While in this position he was sent to Oxford for further training where he met Robert Gwyn Macfarlane. Macfarlane had developed a first theory of coagulation. Hemker doubted the validity of the theory and thought one of the enzymes played a different role. The two men found Hemker's idea was correct and they subsequently published their findings in Nature."]}]}}
