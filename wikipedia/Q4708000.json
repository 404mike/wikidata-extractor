His personality was considered cold and aloof, annoying even to his friends. Alan Watkins observed in 1991 that his \"brusqueness, his gaucherie, his lack of small or indeed any talk, his sheer bad manners\" were among the factors costing him the support of Conservative backbenchers in the subsequent Conservative leadership election.Watkins 1991, pp. 174\u2013175"]}, {"page": "The Independent", "response": ["* Patrick Cockburn, John Rentoul, Joan Smith, Paul Vallely, and Alan Watkins\u2014\"Comment & Debate\""]}, {"page": "Iain Macleod", "response": ["Macleod used government papers in breach of the \"Fifty-year rule\" then in operation. Cabinet Secretary Sir Norman Brook persuaded the Prime Minister to demand amendments to conceal the degree of Cabinet involvement in the abdication of King Edward VIII (who was still alive in 1961) and the degree to which the civil servants Horace Wilson and Warren Fisher had demanded that the former King \"reorder his private life\" afterwards. Former Prime Minister Lord Avon, who cherished his (somewhat exaggerated) reputation as an opponent of \"appeasement\", complained that such a book by a serving Cabinet Minister might be thought to express official sympathy for Chamberlain's policies. Downing Street had to brief the press that Macleod had written purely in a personal capacity; Shepherd suggests that Macleod's loss of favour with Macmillan, who had also been an opponent of appeasement, was accelerated by this episode. Robert Blake wrote in his review in The Times (26 November 1961) that \"when national security is at stake one does not judge a statesman by his successes at slum clearance\".Dutton 2001, p.7 Macleod later told Alan Watkins (in \"Brief Lives\" 1982) \"It was a bad book. I made a great mistake in writing it. It made me no money, and it has done me a lot of harm\". Watkins conceded that the book \"had been grudgingly and meanly reviewed\". The book \"sold poorly and was soon forgotten\".", "Ian Gilmour appointed him editor of The Spectator. He wrote his own weekly column under the pseudonym of \"Quoodle\" and also sometimes wrote signed articles complaining about what the ODNB describes as his \"pet hates\" such as Harold Wilson or the BBC.
