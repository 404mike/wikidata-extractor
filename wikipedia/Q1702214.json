In 1837, the Russian envoy Captain Jan Vitkevitch visited Kabul, and the British believed that it was to facilitate some form of diplomatic or military presence in Afghanistan. While in Kabul, he dined with the British envoy, Captain Alexander Burnes, who reported negatively on Russia's intentions. Russia feared British inroads on their commerce in Central Asia, as well as the influence that a Muslim power with British support might have on the other khanates."]}, {"page": "John (given name)", "response": ["*John Wood (surgeon) (1825\u20131891), British surgeon at King's College Hospital", "*John Wood (baseball) (1872\u20131929), baseball player", "*John Wood (canoeist) (1950\u20132013), Canadian Olympic flatwater canoer", "*John Wood (racing driver) (born 1952), CART driver", "*John Wood (rugby league) (born 1956), Great Britain, and Leigh", "*John Wood (millowner) (1758\u2013????), created the Howard Town Mills complex in Glossop, England", "*John Wood (Bradford manufacturer) (1793\u20131871), English industrialist and factory reformer", "*John Wood (explorer) (1812\u20131871), Scottish explorer of central Asia", "*John Wood (photographer), Civil War photographer for Union Army"]}, {"page": "Roof of the World", "response": ["The British explorer John Wood, writing in 1838, described Bam-i-Duniah (Roof of the World) as a \"native expression\" (presumably Wakhi),Keay, John (1983) When Men and Mountains Meet ; p. 153 and it was generally used for the Pamirs in Victorian times: In 1876, another British traveler, Sir Thomas Edward Gordon, employed it as the title of a bookSir Thomas Edward Gordon, The Roof of the World:  being a narrative of a journey over the high plateau of Tibet to the Russian frontier and the Oxus sources on Pamir, Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1876 and wrote in Chapter IX:"]}, {"page": "Pamir Mountains", "response": ["The lapis lazuli found in Egyptian tombs is thought to come from the Pamir area in Badakhshan province of Afghanistan. This section is based on the book by R. Middleton and H. Thomas: Robert Middleton and Huw Thomas, 'Tajikistan and the High Pamirs',Odyssey Books, 2008 About 138 BC Zhang Qian reached the Fergana Valley northwest of the Pamirs. Ptolemy vaguely describes a trade route through the area. From about 600 AD, Buddhist pilgrims travelled on both sides of the Pamirs to reach India from China. In 747 a Tang army was on the Wakhan River. There are various Arab and Chinese reports. Marco Polo may have travelled along the Panj River. In 1602 Bento de Goes travelled from Kabul to Yarkand and left a meager report on the Pamirs. In 1838 Lieutenant John Wood reached the headwaters of the Pamir River. From about 1868 to 1880, a number of Indians in the British service secretly explored the Panj area. In 1873 the British and Russians agreed to an Afghan frontier along the Panj River. From 1871 to around 1893 several Russian military-scientific expeditions mapped out most of the Pamirs (Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko, Nikolai Severtzov, Captain Putyata and others. Later came Nikolai Korzhenevskiy). Several local groups asked for Russian protection from Afghan raiders. The Russians were followed by a number of non-Russians including Ney Elias, George Littledale, the Earl of Dunmore, Wilhelm Filchner and Lord Curzon who was probably the first to reach the Wakhan source of the Oxus River. In 1891 the Russians informed Francis Younghusband that he was on their territory and later escorted a Lieutenant Davidson out of the area ('Pamir Incident'). In 1892 a battalion of Russians under Mikhail Ionov entered the area and camped near the present Murghab. In 1893 they built a proper fort there (Pamirskiy Post).  In 1895 their base was moved to Khorog facing the Afghans."]}, {"page": "John Wood", "response": ["John Wood may refer to:", "* John Wood, the Elder (1704\u20131754), English architect", "* John Wood, the Younger (1728\u20131782) architect", "* John Wood (professor) (c.1775\u20131822), American professor of mathematics", "* John Wood (design theorist) (born 1945), British professor of design ", "* John Wood (activist) (born 1964), education activist, marketing director at Microsoft", "* John Wood (actor, born 1909), Australian actor", "* John Wood (actor, born 1946), Australian actor who appeared in the police drama Blue Heelers", "* John Wood (English actor) (1930\u20132011), Shakespearean actor", "* Mrs. John Wood (1831\u20131915), British actor", "* John Wood, birth name of actor John Fortune", "* John Wood (artist) (1922\u20132012), American artist", "* John Wood (director) (1925\u20132015), pseudonym of Spanish director Juan Bosch", "* John Wood (poet) (born 1947), American poet and historian of photography", "* John Wood (record producer), English record producer", "* John Wood (painter) (1801\u20131870), English history and portrait painter, see Thomas Stothard", "* John Atwood (colonial administrator) (1576\u20131644), also known as John Wood, Assistant Governor of the Plymouth Colony", "* John Wood (congressman) (1816\u20131898), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania", "* John Wood (Florida politician) (born 1952), member of the Florida House of Representatives", "* John Wood (governor) (1798\u20131880), governor of Illinois", "* John Wood (MP for Ipswich), English MP for Ipswich in 1420", "* John Wood (died 1458), English MP for Worcester and Worcestershire", "* John Wood I of Keele, English MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme", "* John Wood II of Keele, English MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme", "* Sir John Wood (speaker) (died 1484), English MP and Speaker of the House of Commons", "* John Wood (Scottish courtier) (died 1570), Secretary to Regent Moray", "* John Wood (MP for Bossiney) (died 1623), English MP for Bossiney", "* John Wood (Isle of Man governor), Governor of the Isle of Man, 1761\u20131777", "* John Wood (MP for Preston) (1789\u20131856), British MP for Preston", "* John Wood (civil servant, born 1790) (1790\u20131856), British civil servant", "* Sir John Wood, 1st Baronet (1857\u20131951), British Member of Parliament", "* Sir John Wood (civil servant, born 1870) (1870\u20131933), civil servant in the Indian Civil Service", "* John Wood (Australian politician) (1829\u20131914), Victorian and Tasmanian Legislative Assemblies", "* John Wood (diplomat) (born 1944), New Zealand diplomat", "* John Wood (surgeon) (1825\u20131891), British surgeon at King's College Hospital", "* John Wood (Surrey cricketer, born 1744) (1744\u20131793), English cricketer", "* John Wood (Kent cricketer, born 1745) (1745\u20131816), English cricketer", "* John Wood (New Zealand cricketer) (1839\u20131909), New Zealand cricketer", "* John Wood (Australian cricketer) (1865\u20131928), Australian cricketer", "* John Wood (civil servant, born 1870) (1870\u20131933), English cricketer", "* John Wood (cricketer, born 1970), English cricketer", "* John Wood (footballer, born 1880) (1880\u20131916), English footballer", "* John Wood (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131959), English footballer", "* John Wood (footballer, born 1948), English footballer", "* John Wood (Scottish footballer) (1894\u20131971), Scottish forward", "* John Wood (American football) (born 1951), American football player", "* Jackie Wood (1919\u20131993), real name Edward John Wood, footballer", "* John Wood (baseball) (1872\u20131929), baseball player", "* John Wood (canoeist) (1950\u20132013), Canadian Olympic flatwater canoer", "* John Wood (racing driver) (born 1952), CART driver", "* John Wood (rugby league) (born 1956), Great Britain, and Leigh", "* John Wood (millowner) (1758\u2013?), created the Howard Town Mills complex in Glossop, England", "* John Wood (Bradford manufacturer) (1793\u20131871), English industrialist and factory reformer", "* John Wood (explorer) (1812\u20131871), Scottish explorer of central Asia", "* John Wood (photographer) (dates unknown), Civil War photographer for Union Army", "* John Wood, subject of Finders Keepers (2015 film)", "*John Woods (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Pamir River", "response": ["John Wood was the first known European to try to find the source of the Oxus, or Pamir River.
