Cutmore was primarily a middle-order batsman who played right-handed, making a total of almost 16,000 runs in 342 first-class matches at an average of 28.61; however, he also bowled on occasion, taking 11 wickets at an average of 62.45.\nCutmore was born in Walthamstow, Essex (now in the London Borough of Waltham Forest). He made his Essex debut on 5 July 1924 in a home match against Surrey in the 1924 County Championship; coming in at number 7, he made 18 runs in the first innings and 29 in the second, as well as taking the second-innings wicket of William Abel with one of the four balls he bowled in the innings; Surrey won the match by 5 wickets. As his career continued, Cutmore rose up the Essex batting line-up, even opening the innings on occasion; in 1927, he opened the batting in an away match against Gloucestershire at Greenbank and went on to make his career best score of 238 not out before Essex declared on 578/6. By the end of his career, Cutmore had settled near the top of the middle-order. His final appearance came on 17 June 1936, away to Yorkshire; with Essex batting second, Cutmore came in at number 3 and made 21 runs before being trapped LBW by Bill Bowes; in the second innings, he opened the batting, but this time made only 13 runs before he was caught by Arthur Mitchell off the bowling of Hedley Verity.\nCutmore died in Brentwood, Essex, on 30 November 1985 at the age of 86.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dudley Pope (cricketer)", "response": ["Dudley Fairbridge Pope (28 October 1906 \u2013 8 September 1934) was an English cricketer.

He played 159 first-class matches for Essex and Gloucestershire between 1925 and his death in a car accident in 1934.
