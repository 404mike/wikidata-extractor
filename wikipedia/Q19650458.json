Their village is attacked by a group of wildlings. His father is killed by Ygritte and his mother by Styr. Styr tells Olly that he is going to eat his dead parents and orders him to tell the men of the Night's Watch at Castle Black in an attempt to draw them out into the open. He then releases Olly, who reaches Castle Black and informs the men of the approaching wildlings, in the process befriending Jon Snow. In the wildling attack on Castle Black, Olly shoots and kills Ygritte from behind in revenge for his father. In season 5, Jon takes Olly as an apprentice, mirroring his own father-son relationship with Jeor Mormont. When Jon is named the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Olly is named Jon's personal steward. He is unhappy with Jon's efforts to help the wildlings and participates in Jon's assassination, stabbing Jon through the heart. When Jon's loyalists and the wildlings rebel, Olly is arrested along with the mutineers, and after Jon's resurrection, he is executed by hanging."]}, {"page": "Millennium Mills", "response": ["In 2020, it appeared in episode 1 of the IMBb series Alex Rider, starring Otto Farrant and Brenock O'Connor."]}, {"page": "List of awards and nominations received by Game of Thrones", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Allen, Alfie\"| Alfie Allen, Ian Beattie, John Bradley, Gwendoline Christie, Emilia Clarke, Michael Condron, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Ben Crompton, Liam Cunningham, Stephen Dillane, Peter Dinklage, Nathalie Emmanuel, Tara Fitzgerald, Jerome Flynn, Brian Fortune, Joel Fry, Aidan Gillen, Iain Glen, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Michiel Huisman, Hannah Murray, Brenock O'Connor, Daniel Portman, Iwan Rheon, Owen Teale, Sophie Turner, Carice Van Houten, Maisie Williams, and Tom Wlaschiha", "| data-sort-value=\"O'Connor, Brenock\"| Brenock O'Connor"]}, {"page": "Game of Thrones (season 4)", "response": ["* Brenock O'Connor as Olly"]}, {"page": "Young Hunters: The Beast of Bevendean", "response": ["Young Hunters: The Beast of Bevendean is a British children\u2019s adventure film directed by Ewan Gorman and starring Aaron Swartz, Jonathan Hansler, Brenock O'Connor and Toby Murray.

NME Will Richards gave the series three out of five stars, describing it as a second-chance for the Alex Rider series following the failure of the 2006 Stormbreaker movie adaptation. Richards observed that the series avoided the clich\u00e9d James Bond gadgets for the first two episodes. Richards praised Farrant's performance as Alex Rider but opined that the series needed tinkering to identify its target audience. Richards also described co-star Brenock O'Connor's performance as Alex's best friend Tom Harris as charismatic.
