The club finished first in the regular season and were crowned minor premiers for the first time, allowing them to enter the final series at the major semifinal. In the finals series, the Glory lost to Wollongong Wolves 1\u20130 at Brandon Park, the Wolves' home ground, in the first leg of the major semifinal. The second leg of the major semifinal was held at Subiaco Oval, rather than their regular venue Perth Oval, to accommodate an expected larger crowd. In the match, Perth Glory won 2\u20130 over the Wolves, 2\u20131 on aggregate, to qualify for the grand final. The crowd of 42,764 was an Australian record for a club soccer match. In the wake of the record crowd, the Western Australian government announced a purpose-built stadium for the Glory in central Perth. The 1999/2000 grand final is remembered as one of the most thrilling matches in NSL history. Perth again faced the Wolves and led 3\u20130 at half time against a miserable Wolves outfit; thinking the game was won, Stange substituted key Glory players Scott Miller, Bobby Despotovski and Ivan Ergi\u0107. Yet, the Wolves rallied superbly and Perth experienced a series of defensive blunders to be pegged back to 3\u20133 at full-time. Perth subsequently lost on penalties, but this defining moment galvanised the team and would be a motivating force for years to come. James Afkos, a young defender and son of Glory co-owner Paul Afkos saw his penalty saved, which gave the win to the Wolves. The Wolves side also featured players such as Scott Chipperfield, Sa\u0161o Petrovski as well as Matt Horsley and Stuart Young who would go on to play with the Glory in later years. The loss was a crushing blow to Glory but the team had done well despite problems Stange had with stars such as Vas Kalogeracos and Con Boutsianis who had both left the club. Stange had also been told midway through the season that his contract would not be renewed\u2014but well-organised supporter protest and media pressure forced Tana to change his mind and publicly announce the U-turn before a home match against the Canberra Cosmos."]}, {"page": "Singapore Premier League", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1998|| Stuart Young||Home United|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 A-League", "response": ["|  Stuart Young1  Milan Jovani\u01073"]}, {"page": "Wollongong Wolves FC", "response": ["The Wolves followed up their past season win by again placing second in the 2000\u201301 NSL season.
