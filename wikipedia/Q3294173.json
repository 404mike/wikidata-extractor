At Leeds he also won the 2004\u201305 Powergen Cup.He was called up to the senior Scotland training squad in October 2008, however he was ultimately not capped at that level.\nMcMillan's position of choice is as at scrum-half.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Danny Care", "response": ["After a summer spent getting fit and completing his A-level studies at Prince Henry's, Care was able to join Tykes on a full-time basis with the opportunity to train alongside All Black scrum-half legend Justin Marshall who signed for the club during the close season. A pre-season injury to Tykes' No.2 scrum-half Mark McMillan gave Care an early opportunity to understudy Marshall and he made his Guinness Premiership debut away at Saracens in September 2005 as a replacement for Marshall late in the game. Over the coming weeks further opportunities arose for first team experience including starting appearances in the Powergen Cup against Sale (which brought his first senior try) and against Newcastle (which brought his first man-of-the-match award)."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Premiership Rugby", "response": ["|SH ||20|| Mark McMillan ||  "]}, {"page": "Warren Fury", "response": ["After release by Leeds following a knee injury and the club's demotion from the Premiership, in January after completing rehabilitation on his right knee 2012 he was signed by Bath for three months as cover for long-term injury Mark McMillan."]}, {"page": "2007 Heineken Cup Final", "response": ["|SH ||20|| Mark McMillan || || "]}, {"page": "2010 end-of-year rugby union internationals", "response": ["|SH ||9 ||Mark McMillan"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Powergen Cup", "response": ["| ||20|| Mark McMillan"]}, {"page": "Pros Vs Heroes", "response": ["* Mark McMillan  "]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Glasgow Warriors season", "response": [" Mark McMillan", "|SH||||Mark McMillan||14(1)||1||0||2(1)||0||0||16(2)||0", "Glasgow Warriors: Colin Shaw;
