XIX (1960), pp. 477-487 @ Venerabile After apparently receiving his doctorate of divinity in Rome, Bavant took himself to the English College in Rheims, where he worked with cardinal William Allen before returning to England as a missionary on 15 June 1581, with, amongst others, the scholar, poet and Jesuit, Jasper Heywood.  After narrowly escaping arrest in Harrow, Middlesex, in November 1554, he was finally caught at Longford, Derbyshire, and by April 1585 he found himself locked up in the Wood Street Counter, in London.Godfrey Anstruther, The Seminary Priests, vol. I (Ware & Durham 1969), p. 27 @ Internet Archive A petition was raised to have him released on the grounds of his age; and eventually he was set free.  He continued his mission, and in the years that followed was reported to be active in Huntingdonshire and Berkshire. He was also protected by sir Thomas Tresham, who as a child was a ward of sir Robert Throckmorton, Bavant's patron at Solihull. Tresham also supported Bavant's old pupil Campion.  In May 1595, he was called in to help settle the disputes amongst the Roman Catholic clergy imprisoned in Wisbech Castle, in Cambridgeshire. Bavant took an active and generally conciliatory role in the so-called \u2018Wisbech Stirs\u2019, that continued until 1598.P.

Following the Gunpowder Plot, archpriest George Blackwell, then head of the English Catholic secular clergy, wrote to Rome and obtained a letter from Pope Paul V condemning the plot and calling on English Catholics not to disturb the peace. Blackwell had at first disapproved of the oath, but citing the Pope's call for civil obedience, advised his priests that the oath could licitly be taken. The Pope, however, condemned the new oath soon afterwards. After the pope's Brief, he disallowed it once more. Blackwell was captured on 24 June 1607 and interrogated over the following ten days about his opinion of the oath. At the end of that period he was tendered the oath, which he took, relying on James's statement that no encroachment on conscience was intended, and recommended others do the same. The pope then issued a new Brief (23 August 1607), repeating his prohibition. Bellarmine wrote a letter (18 September 1607) to Blackwell, an acquaintance from Flanders many years previously, reproaching him for having taken the oath in apparent disregard of his duty to the pope. Blackwell's position satisfied neither the Pope, who condemned it within days of Bellarmine's letter and replaced Blackwell by George Birkhead (February 1608), nor the English government, who imprisoned him."]}, {"page": "William Harrison (Archpriest of England)", "response": ["Following the death of George Birkhead in 1614, Harrison was appointed archpriest of England by Pope Paul V on 23 February 1615.
