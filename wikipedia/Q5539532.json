In 1894 the club merged with Castle Swifts F.C. to form Old Castle Swifts and Furnell remained there until they folded in 1895. He then spent a season and a half captaining St Luke's from Beckton before they also folded.\nIt was towards the end of the 1896\u201397 season that Furnell, who was already a labourer at the shipbuilding company joined Thames Ironworks, making his debut in the final London League game of the season, a 1\u20131 draw against Barking Woodville.\nHe became first choice keeper for the club during the 1897\u201398 season and helped them win the London League and promotion to the Southern League by keeping clean sheets in five of his ten games. By November 1897 his form was good enough to earn him recognition at a county level when he was selected to play for Essex against Middlesex, a game that Middlesex won 5\u20132. During that season he also played in all three of the club's FA Cup games, two games in the London Senior Cup, as well as at least ten friendlies, the last of which he played at left-half. In all, he played a minimum of 26 games for Thames Ironworks.\nHe moved on to Hammersmith Athletic in 1898\u201399.", "link_mentions": []}}
