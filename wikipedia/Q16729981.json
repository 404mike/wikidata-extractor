He started the tartanpodcast in March 2005 quickly following it with the \"Sleepy Sunday Show\" and \"The Spotlight Show\". The tartanpodcast was the first music-based podcast from Scotland.\nThe summer of 2006 saw him start \"The Mellow Monday Show\".\nProduction of the tartanpodcast, a showcase music podcast for Scottish indie bands, ended in June 2007 after 110 episodes. Following a one-off episode in October, the tartanpodcast returned as a regular show in February 2008.\nMark tried to keep a down to earth production standard for the tartanpodcast, referring to himself as just a guy, living and working in Glasgow, Scotland.An article on the BBC Technology site from June 5, 2005 raised the profile of the tartan podcast.  Several podcasters have since attributed their decision to start their own podcast to reading this article.\nMark was approached late in December 2007 and asked to become managing director of new media production company Podcastmatters Ltd.In 2009 Mark set up a new company Postable and undertook the role of Social Media Manager at a tool retailer called Toolstop.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Hunter", "response": ["Mark Hunter may refer to:", "* Sir Mark Hunter (civil servant) (1865\u20131932), schoolmaster in India", "* Mark Hunter (politician) (born 1957), British politician and LibDem MP for Cheadle", "* Mark Hunter (ice hockey) (born 1962), retired NHL ice hockey player", "* Mark Hunter (footballer) (born 1965), former Australian rules footballer with Footscray", "* Mark Hunter (musician) (born 1977), singer for the now defunct American heavy metal band Chimaira", "* Mark Hunter (rower) (born 1978), Olympic gold medalist rower and Leander Club member", "* Mark Hunter (keyboard player), keyboard player associated with Manchester band James", "* Mark Hunter (podcaster), Scottish podcaster behind The Mellow Monday Show and the Tartan Podcast"]}]}}
