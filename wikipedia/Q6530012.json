He made his debut for Southend in 1949\n\nand scored 45 goals in 88 games over the next four seasons. In November 1952, he joined Chelsea for \u00a310,000 having been persuaded by Blues manager Ted Drake that he was capable of playing in the top tier.\nHis career with Chelsea started slowly and Stubbs played just five games in his first season, without scoring. However, he scored nine goals in thirty league games in 1953\u201354 and in the next helped Chelsea win their first League title. He scored five goals that season, including a crucial stoppage time equaliser against Chelsea's main rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, paving the way for teammate Roy Bentley's winner a minute later. He then helped Chelsea win the Charity Shield.Stubbs' later years at Chelsea saw his playing opportunities reduced by the emergence of talented youngsters such as Jimmy Greaves, Peter Brabrook and Ron Tindall. He made only sixteen appearances in his final two seasons, though he did play for the representative London XI side which competed in the 1955\u201358 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Stubbs ended his Chelsea career with 123 appearances and 35 goals to his name. He left in 1958 to re-join Southend for a further two years, scoring 3 goals in 23 games. He later turned out for Bedford Town before re-joining Great Wakering Rovers, where he remains the most successful product of that club.\nWhen Chelsea won the FA Premier League title in 2004\u201305, Stubbs and his surviving teammates from the 1954\u201355 title-winning side, such as Roy Bentley, Stan Willemse, Frank Blunstone and Jim Lewis were invited to the trophy presentation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London XI", "response": ["Team: Ted Ditchburn (Tot), Stan Charlton (Ars), Dennis Evans (Ars), Brian Nicholas (Che), Jim Fotheringham (Ars), Phil McKnight (Ley), Peter Berry (Cry), Geoff Truett (Cry), Les Stubbs (Che), Phil Woosnam (Ley), Joe Haverty (Ars)."]}, {"page": "2011 in association football", "response": ["* 1 February \u2013 Les Stubbs, English footballer (81)"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Chelsea F.C. season", "response": ["|  Les Stubbs"]}, {"page": "1955 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|IL ||10|| Les Stubbs"]}, {"page": "Peter Sampson", "response": ["He was the cousin of former Chelsea player Les Stubbs."]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Les Stubbs, footballer (b. 1929)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2011", "response": ["*Les Stubbs, 81, British footballer."]}]}}
