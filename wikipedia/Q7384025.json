In the words of Erwan Le Corre, \"Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore.\" Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, \"Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say about a sport, and parkour is not a sport\u2014it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'\" This seems to be the consensus among many professional traceurs who view parkour as a  lifestyle more than as a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.", "Parkour is also featured on TV. MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name.
