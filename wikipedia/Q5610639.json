John. Beevor, Rector of Claypole, Lincolnshire. He was educated at the grammar school at Louth, and was admitted an attorney and solicitor in 1839. He was in practice at Newark, in partnership with J. T. B. Pratt, but gave up his legal practice in 1870. He was a director of the Law Life Assurance Co. and the Midland Railway Company and chairman of the London Chatham and Dover Railway. He was also a Justice of the Peace (JP) for Newark and Nootinghamshire.At the 1859 general election Hodgkinson was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Newark, defeating the sitting Liberal MP the Earl of Lincoln.

Overwhelming election of the landed class or otherwise very wealthy to the Commons would no longer be assured by money, bribery and favours, those elected would reflect the most common sentiment of local units of the public. The brand-new franchise provisions were briefly flawed; the act did not address the issues of compounding and of not being a ratepayer in a household. Compounding (counting of one's under-tenants payments and using that count as a qualification) as to all rates and rents was made illegal, abolished in the enactment of a bill tabled by Liberal Grosvenor Hodgkinson. This meant that all male tenants would have to pay the parish/local rates directly thus thereafter qualified for the vote.
