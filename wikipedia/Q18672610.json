He was a member of the Norwich School of painters, and lived in the city of Norwich all his life.\nBorn into a wealthy brewing family, Lound was affluent enough to possess his own photographic equipment as well as to pursue his passion for art. He become an avid collector of works of art, and particularly admired (and collected) the paintings of the Norwich painter John Thirtle. Lound was popular amongst his contemporaries, and close friends with the Norwich artists Robert Leman, Henry Bright and John Middleton. Throughout his life he suffered from ill health, and he died suddenly of apoplexy at the age of 59, a year after the deaths of his wife and son.\nLound is considered by art historians to rank among the best of the watercolourists of the Norwich School. He was trained by John Sell Cotman, but his artistic style was more heavily influenced by the landscapist David Cox. Lound's etchings, never produced for public display, show the influence of drypoint technique of Edward Thomas Daniell. He was also a competent copyist with a talent for imitating the artistic style of other artists. His oil paintings contain both broad brush and fine brushwork; he exhibited 12 works with the Norwich Society of Artists from 1820 to 1833, and showed works in London at the British Institution and the Royal Academy of Arts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norwich School of painters", "response": ["File:Thomas Lound - A View near Norwich - Google Art Project.jpg|Thomas Lound, A View near Norwich (c. 1850), Yale Center for British Art", "*Thomas Lound"]}, {"page": "Sprowston", "response": ["The artist Thomas Lound was born in Sprowston in 1801.Thomas Lound in \"Baptisms, burials and marriages 1718-1812 Beeston St. Andrew baptisms, burials and marriages 1761/2, 1795-1812\", FamilySearch ()."]}, {"page": "Lound", "response": ["*Thomas Lound (1801\u20131861), British painter of landscapes "]}, {"page": "Edward Thomas Daniell", "response": ["Daniell later employed a looser style, moving away from Stannard and towards that of Andrew Geddes and other Scottish etchers, whose output he almost certainly first saw while in Scotland during the summer of 1831. His was outstanding in the use of drypoint, strengthening his design by using the needle's point to create a burr in the plate. The burrs allowed the ink to collect, producing a darker tone in some of his prints. Thistlethwaite views the large drypoint etchings and Norfolk landscapes made after 1831 as being \"supremely independent and for his time unique\", once he had moved away from the traditional style of etchers like Geddes. He is thought to have introduced drypoint etching to his Norwich peers; both Thomas Lound and Henry Ninham etched in this way after 1831, producing works of a quality approaching Daniell's own."]}, {"page": "John Thirtle", "response": ["Paintings by members of the Norwich School were framed by Thirtle, including those by Cotman, John Crome, Thomas Lound, James Sillett, and Joseph Stannard. When Thirtle framed George Vincent's oil painting Trowse Meadows, near Norwich (first exhibited in 1828), he made a watercolour version of it. His trade label took several forms, ranging from the early 'Thirtle, Miniature Painter, & Drawing Master' to the elaborate 'Carver, Gilder, Picture Frame and Looking Glass Manufacturer, Wholesale and Retail', used in the 1830s.", "* Works by Thirtle (including several prints by Thomas Lound after Thirtle) at the British Museum"]}, {"page": "John Middleton (Norfolk artist)", "response": ["Middleton's artistic output was influenced by (and in turn had an influence upon) the works of Henry Bright, Thomas Lound and Robert Leman. The four artists were very good friends.", "Although Henry Bright was Middleton's teacher, the outstanding watercolours Bright produced in the 1840s made after a sketching tour of Kent, when he was possibly accompanied by Middleton, show clearly how he was influenced by his pupil. It often difficult to distinguish between the two artists. According to the art historian Francis Cheetham, Lane over the Hill shows Bright's capacity to \"use watercolour with (the) freshness and simplicity which characterises the finest work of John Middleton\". Their friendship was not always smooth: in a letter of 22 February 1850 to Thomas Lound's son, Bright wrote, \"J. Middleton dined here tonight, he was wondrous polite. Tell your good papa that my Lecture did him good.\"", "Writing in 1905, Dickes described Middleton as a painstaking and energetic artist. The Dictionary of National Biography noted his \"effective rendering of the seasons of the year, especially the early spring\". Walpole has assessed his approach to his work as being more advanced than that of his contemporaries Robert Leman and Thomas Lound. Commentators have praised his ability to show tone in his paintings. According to Josephine Walpole, Middleton's \"exquisite use of light and shade enhances the mastery of tonal values\", a comment that echoes the Norfolk Chronicle\u2032s report of 11 December 1847, which described his \"charming use of light and shade\"."]}]}}
