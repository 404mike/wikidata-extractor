He then went to the British School at Athens and helped on excavations in Laconia, Greece namely in Geraki and Angelona, Cyzicus and Bithynia, finding much new material, including an inscription of Cn. Pompeius Magnus and unpublished local coins. His most notable find was a large Roman bridge in Mysia, hitherto unrecorded, the Aesepus Bridge. There he also investigated the sites of the Makestos Bridge, White Bridge and Constantine's Bridge. In 1906 he toured Asia Minor with Richard M. Dawkins.\nIn 1913, being Assistant Director (1911\u201315) and Librarian (1906\u201315) of the British School in Athens, Hasluck married Margaret Hardie. As a wedding present, Hardie chose a visit to Konya (ancient Iconium) from the options offered her by her husband, and the couple spent the spring of 1913 there together. Frederick had long been interested in the interplay of Christianity and Islam within the Turkish Empire, and he was gradually to make this a central part of his work. The Haslucks were based in Athens and, over the next four years, had the opportunity to travel widely together in the southwest Balkans.\nHasluck's work was cut short by a combination of factors, one of which was his becoming the target of Alan John Bayard Wace, an erstwhile colleague in Athens, who appears to have regarded Hasluck a potential rival. Returning to London, having prepared the ground by becoming part of the managing committee, Wace gained the post of Director of the School and, possibly motivated also by an animosity toward Mrs. Hasluck, asked London to sack Hasluck. This they did. The Haslucks stayed in Athens working at the British Legation and assisted British wartime intelligence operations. In 1916 Margaret accompanied her husband to Switzerland, where he entered a tuberculosis sanatorium. He died four years later on February 22, 1920.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hasluck", "response": ["* Frederick William Hasluck (1878-1920), English archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Margaret Hasluck", "response": ["Margaret Hasluck was born Margaret Hardie and graduated from Aberdeen University where she received Honors in Classics in 1907, and then went to Cambridge, completing her studies with honours in 1911.

It consisted of eight arches, the largest four spanning the river, flanked by two smaller openings at each bank. The span of the largest vault was eighteen paces, its width eight. Small arched chambers immediately under the pavement reduced the load of the bridge; similar relieving chambers also appear in neighbouring ancient bridges such as the Makestos Bridge and the Aesepus Bridge, leading Frederick William Hasluck to postulate a common origin under the reign of emperor Constantine (\u2020\u00a0337\u00a0AD)."]}, {"page": "Macestus Bridge", "response": ["The bridge is located at Sultan\u00e7ay\u0131r, in the heart of the ancient region of Mysia, where it carried the road connecting Hadrianu Therai (Bal\u0131kesir) with Miletopolis across the Macestus. During an exploration tour in 1902, the German archaeologist Theodor Wiegand found the ancient structure still in an excellent state of preservation; only the fourth pier from the eastern bank had been blown up some thirty years before in what was a crude and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to render the river navigable for larger vessels.
