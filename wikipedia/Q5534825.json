He was brought up in Sligo, and educated in England at Haileybury.In 1924 he married the artist Norah McGuinness, whom he divorced in 1930. Their marriage break-up was initially brought about by his involvement with the poet Laura Riding,The poetry collection The Withering of the Fig Leaf (1927) was to be published by the Hogarth Press. At the last moment Phibbs became concerned about perceived anti-Catholic sentiment in it, and asked Leonard Woolf to withdraw it. Another collection, It Was Not Jones, was issued by Hogarth in 1928, but under the pseudonym R. Fitzurse.Riding's lover in 1928 Robert Graves visited Phibbs in Sligo; in 1929 Phibbs came to London, and his arrival unbalanced the menage of Graves, his wife Nancy Nicholson and Laura Riding. There are many accounts, generally contested, of subsequent events.\nAfter some bitter wrangling, Graves and Riding lived together in Spain, and Phibbs set up house with Nicholson in Wiltshire. Phibbs and Norah McGuinness were divorced shortly afterwards. The relationship with Nancy Nicholson gradually came to an end, and it was she who introduced him to Mary Dillwyn, though she was upset when he began a relationship with Mary.In 1935 Phibbs married Mary Dillwyn, and in 1940 they returned to Ireland. He was subsequently known  mostly for anthologies, and non-fiction writing. As literary editor of The Bell, he gave significant space to poetry from Northern Ireland, and allowed Roy McFadden a critical voice. His selection, Irish Poems of Today: Chosen from the First Seven Volumes of \"The Bell\", appeared in 1944. In the same period he met and struck up a strong friendship with John Betjeman; they worked on several poetry collections.\nPhibbs died in Dublin of a heart attack.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Graves", "response": ["Graves's and Nicholson's marriage was strained, with Graves living with \"shell shock\", and having an insatiable need for sex, which Nicholson did not reciprocate.Seymour (2003), p. 80/114 Nancy forbade any mention of the war, which added to the conflict.Seymour (2003), p. 80 In 1926, he would meet Laura Riding, with whom he would run away in 1929 while still married to Nicholson. Prior to this, Graves, Riding and Nicholson would attempt a triadic relationship called \"The Trinity.\" Despite the implications, Riding and Nicholson were most likely heterosexual.Seymour (2003), p. 143 This triangle became the \"Holy Circle\" with the addition of Irish poet Geoffrey Phibbs, who himself was still married to Irish artist Norah McGuinness.Seymour (2003), p. 163 This relationship revolved around the worship and reverence of Riding. Graves and Phibbs were both to sleep with Riding.Seymour (2003), p. 167\u2013168 When Phibbs attempted to leave the relationship, Graves was sent to track him down, even threatening to kill Phibbs if he did not return to the circle.Seymour (2003), p. 172 When Phibbs resisted, Laura threw herself out of a window, with Graves following suit to reach her.Seymour (2003), p. 178 Graves's commitment to Riding was so strong that he entered, on her word, a period of enforced celibacy, \"which he had not enjoyed\".Seymour (2003), p. 201"]}, {"page": "Laura Riding", "response": ["When Riding met the Irish poet, Geoffrey Phibbs, in 1929, she invited him to join the household that already contained herself, Graves, and Graves's wife, Nancy.

This was one of the catalysts for the incident of 27 April 1929, when Riding jumped from a fourth-floor window at the lodgings she shared with Graves, at the height of an argument involving Graves, Phibbs and Nancy Graves; having failed to stop her, Graves also jumped (from a lower floor), but was unharmed, whilst Riding sustained life-threatening injuries."]}, {"page": "Norah McGuinness", "response": ["She married the editor Geoffrey Phibbs, but they divorced in 1930 after Phibbs had left her more than once, notably for the poet Laura Riding."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Taylor (1900-1956)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoffrey Phibbs"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Taylor", "response": ["* Geoffrey Phibbs (1900\u20131956), Irish poet, called himself Geoffrey Taylor"]}, {"page": "Jeoffrey Basil Phibbs", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoffrey Phibbs "]}]}}
