He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1893 to 1921 and from 1924 to 1930, representing the electorates of East Torrens (1893\u20131902, 1915\u20131921, 1924\u20131930) and Torrens (1902\u20131915).Coneybeer was born in Clifton in Bristol, England. His family migrated to Sydney, thence to Orange, New South Wales in 1865, where he was educated, then learned the trade of collar maker from his father and for around ten years followed this trade. In 1880 he moved to Melbourne, where he worked for a while, then to Adelaide, South Australia in 1881, where he found employment with J. A. Holden & Co. He was an active member of the Saddlers' Trade Society, and filled most positions in that Union.\nConeybeer was elected as a member of the United Labor Party in 1893, and served as state Minister for Education under Thomas Price (1908\u20131909) and John Verran (1910\u20131912). In 1915, when Labor regained office under Crawford Vaughan, he was made Speaker of the House of Assembly.In 1917, the Labor Party split over conscription, and Coneybeer followed Vaughan and Verran into the new National Party. The Vaughan government soon fell, and the National Party immediately entered into a coalition government with their former rivals, the Liberal Union, with the National Party as junior partner. Coneybeer remained Speaker throughout, only losing office when lost his seat in 1921, as the coalition split and the National Party was resoundingly defeated statewide. The Liberal and National parties merged to form the Liberal Federation in 1923, and Coneybeer was elected to his old seat as a Liberal at the 1924 election. He was re-elected in 1927, but lost his seat to a Labor candidate in 1930.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Electoral district of Torrens", "response": ["| rowspan = 4| Frederick Coneybeer"]}, {"page": "List of South Australian royal commissions", "response": ["W Hannaford MLC, WJC Cole MP, W Miller MP, J Travers MP, J Jelly MLC, G Bodey MP, Frederick Coneybeer"]}, {"page": "Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly", "response": ["|| 9 || Frederick Coneybeer || United Labor PartyNational Party ||  ||  || align=\"right\"| "]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1927\u20131930", "response": ["|| Hon Frederick Coneybeer || Liberal || East Torrens || 1893\u20131921, 1924\u20131930"]}, {"page": "Electoral results for the district of Torrens", "response": ["| Frederick Coneybeer"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of East Torrens", "response": ["| rowspan=3|Frederick Coneybeer", "| rowspan=3|Frederick Coneybeer", "| rowspan=3|Frederick Coneybeer"]}, {"page": "National Party (South Australia)", "response": ["Following conflict with their senior coalition partner, the National Party ministers were forced to resign from the Cabinet in late 1920, and the party contested the 1921 election, in conjunction with several former Liberals, as the Progressive Country Party. In the absence of any general agreement for the Liberal Union to not contest National Party/Progressive Country seats, the National Party were soundly defeated by their former coalition partner. Five incumbent MPs contested the election under the Progressive Country Party banner: Peter Reidy (Victoria), Edward Alfred Anstey and William David Ponder (North Adelaide), Frederick Coneybeer (East Torrens) and Thomas Hyland Smeaton (Sturt). Former MP John Vaughan also contested Sturt. Of those five, only Reidy survived, having personally arranged with the Liberal Union to be unopposed. William Humphrey Harvey, who had not been up for re-election, remained as the sole survivor of the party in the Legislative Council, but he subsequently joined the Liberal Union in July 1921. The party was again being referred to as the National Party when it merged with the Liberal Union to create the Liberal Federation in October 1923."]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1924\u20131927", "response": ["|| Hon Frederick Coneybeer || Liberal || East Torrens || 1893\u20131921, 1924\u20131930"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1918\u20131921", "response": ["|| Frederick Coneybeer || National || East Torrens || 1893\u20131921, 1924\u20131930"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1918 South Australian state election", "response": ["|East Torrens (3) || Martin CollatonHerbert GeorgeT.
