There they meet Ricki Tarr, an agent recently declared persona non grata due to suspicion of having defected. Tarr defends himself by explaining that he was informed of a Soviet mole, codenamed Gerald, at the Circus' highest level whilst in Hong Kong by Irina, the wife of a trade delegate. Irina claimed that the mole Gerald reports to a Soviet official stationed at the embassy in London called Polyakov. Shortly after Tarr relayed this to the Circus Irina was forcibly returned to the Soviet Union, leading Tarr to suspect that the mole was real, and now knew his identity.

At the outset of the book, the failure of a major operation called \"Testify\" has resulted in Smiley and the former head of the Circus, Control, being fired. Guillam survives the purge of personnel loyal to Smiley, but is demoted to the head of the \"Scalphunters\", fieldmen used in operations that require physical action and/or violence. The position is seen as one of the least desirable in the Circus, described humorously by Smiley as \"cosh and carry\". One of Guillam's agents, Ricki Tarr, inadvertently learns that the failure of Operation Testify\u2014and Smiley's subsequent termination from the Circus\u2014was due to the presence of a mole in the highest echelons of British intelligence. When contacted by Tarr and unsure of whom to trust, he goes to senior Civil Servant Oliver Lacon and, acting as his link man, Guillam facilitates Smiley's secret return from retirement in order to conduct a surreptitious investigation into the identity of the mole. Guillam is motivated not only by his loyalty to Smiley but also because, as a result of the Mole's actions, a network of secret agents he ran in the former French North Africa were identified and executed. Guillam acts as Smiley's man on the inside in the investigation, which involves his actually stealing files from the Circus Registry at Smiley's request. Over the course of the novel, Guillam grows progressively paranoid and anxious regarding the investigation, at one point doubting the veracity of Tarr's allegations. When the mole is finally identified, Guillam loses his temper and physically attacks him, having to be restrained by the other men in the room.
