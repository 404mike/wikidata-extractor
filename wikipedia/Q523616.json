However, the latitude given was off by at least 3 degrees and the description of the shore (including the sighting of bonfires) casts doubts on his discovery. Errors in the latitude measured can be attributed to a simple mistake reading a cross staff divided into minutes meaning the latitude measured could be 50\u00b0 48'. The description of bonfires can also be attributed to peat fires caused by lightning, which is not uncommon in the outer islands of the Falklands in February. In 1925, Conor O'Brian analysed the voyage of Hawkins and concluded that the only land he could have sighted was Steeple Jason Island. The British historian Mary Cawkell also points out that criticism of the account of Hawkins discovery should be tempered by the fact it was written nine years after the event; Hawkins was captured by the Spanish and spent eight years in prison.Cawkell, p.14"]}, {"page": "Scurvy", "response": ["In 1593, Admiral Sir Richard Hawkins advocated drinking orange and lemon juice as a means of preventing scurvy."]}, {"page": "1620s", "response": ["* Richard Hawkins of England (1562\u20131622), explorer and privateer"]}, {"page": "1622", "response": ["* April 17 \u2013 Richard Hawkins, 17th-century English seaman (b. c. 1562)"]}, {"page": "1594", "response": ["* July 1 or July 2 \u2013 Anglo-Spanish War: Action of Atacames Bay \u2013 English privateer Richard Hawkins in the Dainty is attacked and captured by a Spanish squadron off Esmeraldas, Ecuador."]}, {"page": "Privateer", "response": ["Other British privateers of note include Fortunatus Wright, Edward Collier, Sir John Hawkins, his son Sir Richard Hawkins, Michael Geare, and Sir Christopher Myngs.

Sir Richard Hawkins (1562-1622), who made extensive travels in the South Seas, reported in his return that he had been able to supply his men with fresh water by means of shipboard distillation. Additionally, during the early 1600s, several prominent figures of the era such as Francis Bacon or Walter Raleigh published reports on water desalination. These reports and others, set the climate for the first patent dispute concerning desalination apparatus. The two first patents regarding water desalination date back to 1675 and 1683 (patents No.184W. Walcot, Purifying Water, Britain No. 184, 1675 and No. 226,R. Fitzgerald et al, Purifying Salt Water, Britain No. 226, 1683. published by Mr. William Walcot and Mr. Robert Fitzgerald (and others), respectively). Nevertheless, neither of the two inventions was really put into service as a consequence of technical problems derived from scale-up difficulties. No significant improvements to the basic seawater distillation process were made for some time during the 150 years from mid-1600s until 1800."]}, {"page": "Gal\u00e1pagos Islands", "response": ["The first English captain to visit the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands was Richard Hawkins, in 1593.

This description closely resembles the flags of a number of Golden Age pirates.David Cordingly (1995). Under the Black Flag: The Romance and Reality of Life Among the Pirates, New York: Random House, p. 117.", "The flag was probably intended as communication of the pirates' identity, which may have given target ships an opportunity to decide to surrender without a fight.  For example, in June 1720, when Bartholomew Roberts sailed into the harbour at Trepassey, Newfoundland with black flags flying, the crews of all 22 vessels in the harbour abandoned their ships in panic. It is claimed (without contemporary references) that if a ship then decided to resist, the Jolly Roger was taken down and a red flag (in the 20th Century sometimes called the \"Bloody Red\") was flown, indicating that the pirates intended to take the ship by force and without mercy. This claim comes from only one source, in the mid-18th century Sir Richard Hawkins suggested that pirates gave quarter beneath the black flag, while no quarter was given beneath the red flag.Cordingly, p. 117.  Cordingly cites only one source for pages 116\u2013119 of his text: Calendar of State Papers, Colonial, America and West Indies, volumes 1719\u201320, no. 34.

By 1545, Arica was the main export entrepot for Bolivian silver coming down from Potos\u00ed, which then possessed the world's largest silver mine. Arica thus held a crucial role as one of the leading ports of the Spanish Empire. These enviable riches made Arica the target for pirates, buccaneers, and privateers, among whom Francis Drake, Thomas Cavendish, Richard Hawkins, Joris van Spilbergen, John Watling, Baltazar de Cordes, Bartholomew Sharp, William Dampier, and John Clipperton all took part in looting the city."]}, {"page": "English ship Vanguard (1586)", "response": ["During actions against Algerian pirates in 1620, Vanguard flew the flag of Sir Richard Hawkins."]}, {"page": "Henry Carey (writer)", "response": ["Aside from rumor, it is impossible to be sure of Carey's parents.
