He and his father, both coal miners, worked at Dinnington colliery, but Jack managed to get a job as a chauffeur shortly after World War I. In 1926 Jack married, and he was living at Skipton in North Yorkshire when he taught himself to play the pipes. His style, influenced by his father's playing, was steady and controlled; he favoured slow airs, which he played on a set of pipes with a rich, resonant tone. This style was in strong contrast to the faster, more virtuosic playing of Tom Clough and his followers, exemplified by Jack's friend and contemporary, Billy Pigg. His repertoire consisted largely of simple dance tunes and slow airs, from Northumberland and elsewhere, the latter often being given local titles. He also composed some tunes in traditional style, some of which are still played.\nIn an interview recorded in the 1970s, he recalled regular dances at Powburn, led by The Northumbrian Minstrels, Billy Atkinson on melodeon, Jack Thompson also on fiddle, and Bob Clark on drums. Jack was not a regular member of this band, but guested regularly with them. \nThese and others were involved in a concert in Alnwick, which was broadcast live to troops in 1942 - a press cutting relating to this is at.  Jack founded  a band of his own, The Barnstormers in about 1949.\nIn 1948 Jack was made official piper to the Duke of Northumberland. He held this post for many years, retiring in 1971. He was succeeded by Tom Matthews; a recording featuring both is at. During the 1950s Jack made many recordings, together with The Barnstormers and solo, as well as many broadcasts for the BBC. He  recorded a piping album with Patricia Jennings, side one consisting of his solo tracks and side two of pipe duets. Between about 1950 and the folk revival in the 1960s, he was perhaps the most widely known player of the Northumbrian smallpipes, and did much to raise awareness of the instrument.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*Jack Armstrong"]}, {"page": "Jack Armstrong", "response": ["Jack Armstrong may refer to:", "*Jack Armstrong (English footballer) (1884\u20131963), English footballer", "*Jack Armstrong (Australian footballer) (1899\u20131942), Australian footballer", "*Big Jack Armstrong (1945\u20132008), American radio personality from North Carolina", "*Jack Armstrong, American radio personality from northern California on Armstrong & Getty", "*Jack Armstrong (basketball) (born 1963), American basketball broadcaster and former coach", "*Jack Armstrong (baseball) (born 1965), American baseball pitcher", "*Jack Armstrong (piper) (1904\u20131978), English player of the Northumbrian smallpipes", "*Jack Armstrong (artist) (born 1957),  American artist, model, and jeweler", "*Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy, a radio adventure series from 1933 to 1951", "*Jack Armstrong (serial), a 1947 Columbia Pictures film serial"]}, {"page": "Will Atkinson (musician)", "response": ["Later he formed a band The Northumbrian Minstrels with Jack Armstrong playing fiddle and smallpipes, Jack Thompson on fiddle, Bob Clark on drums and Peggy Clark on piano.
