He found Wesleyan theology as a young man and went on to become a much loved and revered driving force of early Methodism in London, becoming influential in continuing the First Great Awakening started by George Whitefield in the 1740s. Hyatt preached regularly in the slums of Hackney in London's East End. He gained a large following and was always in demand for his sermons, which were greatly influenced by those of John Wesley and George Whitefield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John hyatt (minister)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hyatt (minister)"]}, {"page": "Rev.
