Around 1775 she converted to Methodism, this was potentially driven by her bereavement or through the influence of Agnes Smyth. She attended the Whitefriar Street Church, and given her position in society was a prominent figure in the Dublin Methodist community. In June 1788, John Wesley called her \"one of our jewels\" in correspondence.
