He served in the Sikh army during the final years of Punjab's independence, and rose from a trumpeter to the rank of Colonel. He served with the Sikh Khalsa Army, during the First Anglo-Sikh War.\nHe joined Bengal Horse Artillery and in September 1829 resigned his post and moved to Punjab in search of a better future. He joined Maharaja Ranjit Singh's army. It is suspected that he simultaneously worked for Ranjit Singh and spied for the British. He took part in the battle of Peshawar (1834) and the Battle of Jamrud (1837). He was also appointed Revenue Officer of Gujrat for two years (1835\u201336). While most of the European Officers were discharged from the Sikh Army after the first Anglo-Sikh war, John Holmes was retained in service as a reward for supplying secret information to the Ludhiana Political Agency. He was posted at Bannu where, in October 1848, the Sikh troops under his command mutinied and killed him for his treasonable conduct.\nHe was the last European attached to the Sikh army.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Holmes", "response": ["*John Holmes (actor) (1944\u20131988), \"Johnny Wadd\", American pornographic film star and suspect in the Wonderland Murders case", "*John Holmes (composer) (died 1629), English cathedral musician and Renaissance composer", "*John Holmes (poet) (1904\u20131962), American poet", "*John Holmes (British diplomat) (born 1951), British diplomat", "*John Holmes (professor), Australian professor of geography in University of Queensland", "*John Holmes (schoolmaster) (1703\u20131760), English schoolmaster", "*John Holmes (British Army officer) (born 1949), British general", "*John Holmes (mercenary), 19th century Anglo-Indian mercenary", "*John Holmes (Royal Navy officer) (1640?\u20131683), English naval officer", "*John Holmes (by 1529\u20131583), MP for Ripon and Boroughbridge", "*John Holmes (died 1556 or later), MP for Rye", "*John Holmes (Maine politician) (1773\u20131843), member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maine ", "*John Holmes (New Zealand politician) (1831\u20131910), New Zealand Member of Parliament", "*John Holmes (Nova Scotia politician) (1789\u20131876), Canadian Senator", "*John Holmes (Ontario politician) (1828\u20131879), Canadian MP", "*John Holmes (bishop) (died 1904), Anglican colonial bishop", "*John Holmes (cricketer) (1924\u20131980), English cricketer better known as Rodney Holmes", "*John Holmes (rugby league) (1952\u20132009), English former rugby league footballer", "*Jackie Holmes (John Holmes, 1920\u20131995), American race car driver", "*John Holmes (essayist) (1815\u20131894), radical campaigner in Leeds", "*John Holmes (Messenger of the Plymouth Court) (1603\u2013?), Plymouth Colony settler and official"]}, {"page": "Fauj-i-Khas", "response": ["* Colonel John Holmes - Anglo-Indian"]}, {"page": "Mercenaries in India", "response": ["| John Holmes"]}, {"page": "List of mercenaries", "response": ["| John Holmes"]}]}}
