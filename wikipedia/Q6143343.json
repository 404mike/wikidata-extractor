Smith attended Glasgow University before entering his uncle's factory and becoming manager aged 18. Aged 24, his invention of a reaping machine won him a medal from the Imperial Agricultural Society of St Petersburgh. In 1823 Smith came into possession of his uncle's farm, and set about systematically draining the soil and working it with a subsoil plough. In 1831 he published his agricultural recommendations as a small pamphlet, Thorough Draining and Deep Working, which attracted attention in the agricultural crisis of 1834.Smith also introduced mechanical innovations in spinning: in 1834 he improved Archibald Buchanan's self-stripping card, filing a patent (British patent no. 6560) for fixing the flat cards on an endless chain, allowing them to be regularly cleaned.Smith was appointed by Robert Peel to the Commission into the sanitation and health of manufacturing towns, which led to the 1848 Public Health Act: Smith pressed to make liquid manure useful to agriculture. Smith was also an active member of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland, and a member of the Glasgow Philosophical Society, contributing papers to their Transactions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Smith", "response": ["James Smith may refer to:", "* James Smith (Australian rules footballer) (1899\u20131974), Australian rules footballer for Richmond Football Club", "* James Smith (boxer) (born 1953), American boxer, nicknamed \"Bonecrusher\"", "* James Smith (footballer, born 1844) (1844\u20131876), Scottish footballer, played in the first official international football match", "* James Smith (footballer, born 1873) (1873\u2013?), footballer", "* James Smith (footballer, born 1908) (1908\u20131956), English left back who played for Doncaster Rovers, Lincoln City and Bradford City", "* James Smith (footballer, born 1985), English football player (Southport)", "* James Smith (Scottish footballer) (fl. 1922), Scottish football player (Port Vale)", "* James Smith (sports media figure) (born 1959), American boxer and host of In This Corner", "* James Smith (Leicestershire cricketer) (born 1977), English cricketer", "* James Smith (New South Wales cricketer) (1880\u20131958), Australian cricketer", "* James Smith (South Australia cricketer) (born 1988), Australian cricketer", "* James Smith (Kent cricketer) (fl. 1792\u20131796), English cricketer", "* James Smith (New Zealand cricketer) (1891\u20131971), New Zealand cricketer", "* James Smith (sport shooter) (born 1931), American Olympic shooter", "* James Smith (Medal of Honor, 1864) (1826\u20131881), Medal of Honor recipient in the American Civil War", "* James Smith (Medal of Honor, 1872) (1838\u2013?), Medal of Honor recipient for peacetime actions", "* James Smith (VC) (1871\u20131946), English recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* James Smith (Texas General) (1792\u20131855), general in the Revolutionary Army of Texas", "* James Smith (frontiersman) (1737\u20131813), American leader of the Black Boys Rebellion against British rule in colonial America", "* James Smith, British singer and member of Hadouken!", "* James Smith (actor) (born 1948), English actor", "* James Smith, American guitarist for the band Underoath", "* James Smith (born 1999), finalist in Britain's Got Talent", "* James Smith (anaesthetist) (1917\u20131986), Scottish anaesthetist", "* James Smith (Scottish botanist) (1763\u20131848), Scottish botanist", "* James Smith (educator), Scottish principal of the University of Edinburgh, 1732\u20131736", "* James Smith of Jordanhill (1782\u20131867), Scottish merchant, antiquarian, architect, geologist and biblical critic", "* James Smith (Pennsylvania politician) (1720\u20131806), Pennsylvania delegate who signed the United States Declaration of Independence", "* James Smith, 19th-century Canadian Cree Chief, founder of the James Smith First Nation in Saskatchewan", "* James Smith Jr. (1851\u20131927), U.S. Senator from New Jersey", "* James Smith (Kansas politician), Kansas Secretary of State", "* James Smith (New Mexico politician), member of the New Mexico House of Representatives", "* James Smith (1806\u20131868), lawyer, judge and political figure in Quebec", "* James Smith (Canada West politician) (1811\u20131874), lawyer, judge and politician in Canada West", "* James Smith (Canadian politician) (1919\u20132017), former commissioner of the Yukon Territory, 1966\u20131976", "* James Smith (New South Wales politician) (1887\u20131962), former member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "* James Smith (1587\u20131667), alderman of the City of London", "* James Smith (priest) (died 1667), Archdeacon of Barnstaple", "* James Smith (Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District) (1645\u20131711), English Roman Catholic vicar-apostolic", "* James Smith (archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh) (1841\u20131928), Roman Catholic archbishop in Scotland", "* James Smith, a character in the film 8 Mile", "*James Smith (writer) (1775\u20131839), British humorist", "*James Smith (gardener) (died 1789), gardener who journeyed to New Holland (Australia) in 1789", "*James Smith (architect) (c. 1645\u20131731), Scottish architect", "*James Smith (Glasgow architect) (1808-1863) Scottish architect and father of Madeleine Smith", "*James Smith (inventor) (1789\u20131850), British", "*James Smith (journalist) (1820\u20131910), Australian journalist", "*James Smith (miner) (1827\u20131897), Australian miner", "*James Smith (draper) (1765-1823), Close friend of Robert Burns", "*James Smith (murderer) (1936\u20131962), English murderer", "*James Smith (sculptor) (1775-1815), English sculptor", "* James Smith Cree Nation, Saskatchewan, Canada", "* Epitaph for James Smith, a 1785 satirical Scots epitaph written by poet Robert Burns"]}, {"page": "Scottish Agricultural Revolution", "response": ["Improvement continued in the 19th century.

The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 288\u201391. In the first half of the century these changes were limited to tenanted farms in East Lothian and the estates of a few enthusiasts, such as John Cockburn and Archibald Grant. Not all were successful, with Cockburn driving himself into bankruptcy, but the ethos of improvement spread among the landed classes.I. D. Whyte, \"Economy: primary sector: 1 Agriculture to 1770s\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 206\u20137. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. There was increasing specialisation, with the Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the borders of sheep. Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers, the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly known as the Lowland Clearances,Robert Allan Houston and Ian D. Whyte, Scottish Society, 1500\u20131800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , pp. 148\u2013151. when hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years.

The development of Scottish agriculture meant that Scotland could support its increased population with food and it released labour that would take part in industrial production."]}]}}
