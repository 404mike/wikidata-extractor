K. Chesterton, the German-American anthropologist Franz Boas, who argued that advocates of eugenics greatly over-estimate the influence of biology, and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author Halliday Sutherland. Ward's 1913 article \"Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics\", Chesterton's 1917 book Eugenics and Other Evils, and Boas' 1916 article \"Eugenics\" (published in The Scientific Monthly) were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement. Sutherland identified eugenists as a major obstacle to the eradication and cure of tuberculosis in his 1917 address \"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure\",\"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure\" \u2013 an address by Dr Halliday Sutherland on 4 September 1917, published by the Red Triangle Press. and criticism of eugenists and Neo-Malthusians in his 1921 book Birth Control led to a writ for libel from the eugenist Marie Stopes.

Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests in the first half of the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals."]}, {"page": "African clawed frog", "response": ["Xenopus laevis is also notable for its use in the first widely used method of pregnancy testing. In the 1930s, two South African researchers, Hillel Shapiro and Harry Zwarenstein, students of Lancelot Hogben at the University of Cape Town, discovered that the urine from pregnant women would induce oocyte production in X. laevis within 8\u201312 hours of injection. This was used as a simple and reliable test up through to the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Xenopus", "response": ["In 1931, Lancelot Hogben noted that Xenopus laevis females ovulated when injected with the urine of pregnant women. This led to a pregnancy test that was later refined by South African researchers Hillel Abbe Shapiro and Harry Zwarenstein. A female Xenopus frog injected with a woman's urine was put in a jar with a little water. If eggs were in the water a day later it meant the woman was pregnant. Four years after the first Xenopus test, Zwarenstein's colleague, Dr Louis Bosman, reported that the test was accurate in more than 99% of cases.Diagnosis of Pregnancy, Louis P. Bosman, British Medical Journal 1937;2:939, 6 November 1937 From the 1930s to the 1950s, thousands of frogs were exported across the world for use in these pregnancy tests."]}, {"page": "Southsea", "response": ["*Lancelot Hogben, zoologist"]}, {"page": "William Beveridge", "response": ["Beveridge was a member of the Eugenics Society, which promoted the study of methods to 'improve' the human race by controlling reproduction.

Though never fully established, Lancelot Hogben, a fierce anti-eugenicist, was named its chair.

Shapiro's advisor, Lancelot Hogben, claimed to have developed the pregnancy test himself, but refuted by both Shapiro and Zwarenstein in a letter to the British Medical Journal. A later article, independently authored, granted Hogben credit for the principle of using Xenopus to determine gonadotropin levels in pregnant women's urine, but not for its usage as a functional pregnancy test.Gurdon, J B; Hopwood, N (1 February 2003). \"The introduction of Xenopus laevis into developmental biology: of empire, pregnancy testing and ribosomal genes\".

Even Beginnings and Blunders, produced in 1970 by the polymath zoologist Lancelot Hogben, with the subtitle Before Science Began, clung to anthropology as a traditional reference point.  However, its slant makes it clear that 'cultural ecology' would be a more apt title to cover his wide-ranging description of how early societies adapted to environment with tools, technologies and social groupings.

In this sense, \"languages without grammar\" cannot exist.) According to Lancelot Hogben, Peano's Interlingua still shares a major flaw with many other auxiliary languages, having \"either too much grammar of the wrong sort, or not enough of the right\".  (p.\u00a010) Hogben argues that at least nouns and verbs should be easily distinguished by characteristic endings, so that one can easily get an initial understanding of the sentence. Thus, in Peano's Interlingua the verbs might be given some specific, standardized verbal form, such as the infinitive, which is sufficient at the Latin indirect speech.
