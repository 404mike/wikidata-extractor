Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, ethologist Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, ethologist Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow. Snow became a regular visitor to Simla, and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow's own research. Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he would react to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh that had been a gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne's creations were greeted by Beebe with enthusiasm, while those who did not recognize them were just endured by Beebe until they left."]}, {"page": "List of ornithologists", "response": ["*David Snow \u2013 England"]}, {"page": "British Ornithologists' Union", "response": ["* 1987-1990 : David Snow"]}, {"page": "Asa Wright Nature Centre", "response": ["The owners of the Spring Hill Estate, Newcombe and Asa Wright, hosted the noted ornithologists David Snow and Barbara Snow in the 1950s.

The two species evolved together during the early radiation of the Tacsonia clade, because the species exclusively pollinated P. mixta. The position of the flower's anthers and sigmas and the length of the corolla tube make it an inaccessible food source to nearly every species except the sword-billed hummingbird. This mutualistic relationship lets P. mixta depend on the bird for pollination, while the bird obtains a high-quality food source. To obtain nectar, the hummingbird will stick its long bill down the corolla tube (both of which are almost exactly the same length), drink, and then retreat and hover for a few seconds before repeating the process. Other species, such as insects, may be able to access the flower's nectar but do so by puncturing the base and feeding through a hole instead of the corolla tube. Additional evidence of coevolution is that both species also inhabit the same territory range along the Andean mountains. Ornithologist David Snow was the first to extensively describe the relationship between the sword-billed hummingbird and P. mixta. If sword-billed hummingbird populations were to decline, there would most likely be a negative impact on the abundance of P. mixta flowers due to their extreme coevolution."]}, {"page": "1924 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** David Snow, ornithologist (died 2009)"]}, {"page": "Snow (surname)", "response": ["* David Snow (1924\u20132009), English ornithologist ", "* David Snow (born 1989), American football player", "* David Snow ((born 1954), American composer"]}, {"page": "Brewster Medal", "response": ["* 1972: David Snow and Barbara Snow"]}, {"page": "David W.
