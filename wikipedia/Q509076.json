The store became the largest pet store in the world as seafarers moored at the Port of London sold any exotic animals they had brought with them to Jamrach, who in turn supplied zoos, menageries and private collectors. At the north entrance to the nearby Tobacco Dock stands a bronze sculpture of a boy standing in front of a tiger, commemorating an incident where a fully-grown Bengal tiger escaped from Jamrach's shop into the street and picked up and carried off a small boy, who had approached and tried to pet the animal having never seen such a big cat before. The boy escaped unhurt after Jamrach gave chase and prised open the animal's jaw with his bare hands.

Her ear for dialogue is superb, and she has wit and sharp perception\" and though she has her criticisms, concludes that Evans \"has produced a consistently readable book filled with likeable characters: a study of loss that has great heart and humour.\" According to Diriye Osman in the Huffington Post: \"Here was a Bildungsroman of such daring and sustained elegance that it felt like a gorgeous dance of a novel.
