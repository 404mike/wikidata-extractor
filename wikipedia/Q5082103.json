Each of the Albury Conferences involved days full of close and laborious study of the prophetical books of the Bible; attempting to seek out as-yet-unfulfilled prophecies within them.

Irving was a strong believer in the \"gifts\" of \"speaking in tongues\" (glossolalia) and spiritual healing. It was through Irving that M\u2018Neile first encountered the Irish-born Okey Sisters. His experience of the deception of Okey Sisters' reputed speaking in tongues with Irving, and his knowledge of their later association with Elliotson and his mesmerism, and their well-attested fraudulent deception of Elliotson, must have strongly informed his later views of the activities of magnetists such as Lafontaine.For a detailed treatment of Jane and Elizabeth Okey, see pp.155\u2013194 in Clarke, J.
