In an interview with Coduri, Gay Times magazine stated that she is \"beloved\" by members of the gay community because of her role as Jackie, something the actress felt was a \"privilege\". The exposure given to Coduri whilst playing the role led to her being recognised frequently on the street.

Throughout the theatre's time at its first two venues, plays had largely been staged on a repertory basis, with plays being chosen and written around the actors available. After the move to the theatre's current venue in 1996, however, the system largely ended (apart from the 10\u00d710 season in 1998), with the theatre relying more on actors hired for single roles. Partly because of this, and partly because of the ongoing financial pressure on the theatre, in 2001 Ayckbourn chose to write a set of plays which could be performed by the same company of seven actors available at the time. This included three long-standing SJT performers (Robert Austin, Jacqueline King and Bill Champion), two recent additions (Alison Pargeter and Saskia Butler) and two newcomers (Beth Tuckey and Tim Faraday).Preface to Damsels in Distress, Alan Ayckbourn, London: Faber & Faber, Damsels in Distress History on official Ayckbourn siteAllen, Paul (2004) A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn's Plays, London: Faber & Faber, ", "| Jacqueline King"]}, {"page": "House of Saddam", "response": ["* Jacqueline King as April Glaspie, U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 1988 to 1990"]}, {"page": "Donna Noble", "response": ["Donna Noble makes her first appearance, credited as \"The Bride\", in the closing scenes of 2006 series finale \"Doomsday\"; she appears in a wedding dress, outraged to be inexplicably aboard the Doctor's TARDIS.
