Over the next few months, Siouxsie and Severin recruited drummer Kenny Morris - and guitarist Peter Fenton. After playing several gigs in early 1977, they realised that Fenton did not fit in because he was \"a real rock guitarist\". John McKay finally took his place in July. Their first live appearance on television took place in November on Manchester's  Granada, on Tony Wilson's TV show So It Goes. That month they also recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio in which they premiered a new song \"Metal Postcard\", introducing a \"motorik austerity\" in the drums patterns, with \"the space in the sound\" and \"the serrated guitars\". The band described their music as \"cold, machine-like and passionate at the same time\".

He has many followers among the European left, the Latin American left and the anti-globalisation and anti-capitalist movements. Chao is a founding member of ATTAC. Punk and reggae historian Vivien Goldman commented of his work, \"I was writing about Good Charlotte and The Police. They adopted the trappings of punk. They aren\u2019t bad groups, but the punk aspect is more manifested by somebody like Manu Chao. He's one of the punkiest artists out there I can think of. It's an inclusionary spirit that is punk.\""]}, {"page": "More Specials", "response": ["The album is nonetheless dominated by Jerry Dammers and his Muzak-inspired direction, to the point where even The Rough Guide to Rock considers the album to be a venture into lounge music, while critic Scott Plagenhoef found the album to be \"lounge-inspired post-punk.\" Dammers saw his contributions as \"a DIY punk appropriation of Muzak.\" His preferential musical textures on More Specials are, according to Nick Reynolds of BBC Music, \"odd and particularly British,\" citing the \"basic rhythm boxes, brass sections in full cry, and a variety of cheesy keyboards and fairground and cinema organs.\" While the music on the album can be jolly, the album's lyrics are comparably bleak, with English life depicted \"in all its drab, suffocating despair and there's no way out,\" according to Nick Reynolds. John Lewis of Uncut wrote that, compared to the \"teenage male fear writ large\" on the band's first album, More Specials \"presents a dread that\u2019s more existential than adolescent.\" Critic Vivien Goldman nonetheless commented that the band's bleak world view is presented with humour: \"This may be the funniest record of 1980.\"", "Critical reception to More Specials was very favourable, with Vivien Goldman of the NME, John Orme of Melody Maker, Mike Gardner of Record Mirror and Garry Bushell of Sounds all praising the album and considering it a bold step for the band. In the words of Panter, they wrote of how it was a \"[break] away from a safe-ska stance, redifining dance music for the eighties (dance muzak for the eighties, to be precise).\" In the NME, Goldman felt that \"[f]ans expecting more frenetic ska re-runs will do a treble-flip when they hear the conglomerate of Zhivago-esque movie soundtracks and other much-maligned musics the Specials have re-validated. Their energy has become more sensual, too, less St Vitus's dance, more mellow hip-grind.\" She wrote that she would play side two \"more than any other 2 Tone artefact\" and concluded that \"The Specials' maturing process is a proper tonic.\""]}, {"page": "Marquee Moon", "response": ["In NME, Kent wrote that Television have proven to be ambitious and skilled enough to achieve \"new dimensions of sonic overdrive\" with an \"inspired work of pure genius, a record finely in tune and sublimely arranged with a whole new slant on dynamics\". He deemed the album's music vigorous, sophisticated, and innovative at a time when rock is wholly conservative. For Sounds, Vivien Goldman hailed Marquee Moon as \"an obvious, unabashed, instant classic\", while Peter Gammond of Hi-Fi News & Record Review called it one of the most exciting releases in music, highlighted by Verlaine's steely, G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3-like guitar and authentic rock music.; . In Audio, Jon Tiven wrote that although the vocals and production could be more amplified, Verlaine's lyrics and guitar \"manage to viscerally and intellectually grab the listener\". Joan Downs from Time felt the band's sound is distinguished more by the bold playing of Lloyd, who she said has the potential to become a major figure in rock guitar. Christgau, in The Village Voice, claimed Verlaine's \"demotic-philosophical\" lyrics could sustain the album alone, as could the guitar playing, which he said is as penetrating and expressive as Eric Clapton or Jerry Garcia \"but totally unlike either\". Tom Hull, his colleague at the Voice, recalls being in Christgau's apartment when he received an advance copy and witnessing his \"instantly rapturous\" reaction to the album. \"Without being a guitar fetishist\", Hull said he personally found it \"as distinctive and powerful as any of its iconic peers\u2014things like Axis and Layla and Led Zep's first album\"."]}, {"page": "Melody Maker", "response": ["In 1978, Richard Williams returned \u2013 after a stint working at Island Records \u2013 to the paper as the new editor and attempted to take Melody Maker in a new direction, influenced by what Paul Morley and Ian Penman were doing at NME. He recruited Jon Savage (formerly of Sounds), Chris Bohn and Mary Harron to provide intellectual coverage of post-punk bands like Gang of Four, Pere Ubu, and Joy Division and of new wave in general. Vivien Goldman, previously at NME and Sounds, gave the paper much improved coverage of reggae and soul music, restoring the superior coverage of those genres that the paper had in the early 1970s. Despite this promise of a new direction for the paper, internal tension developed, principally between Williams and Coleman, by this time editor-in-chief, who wanted the paper to stick to the more \"conservative rock\" music it had continued to support during the punk era. Coleman had been insistent that the paper should \"look like The Daily Telegraph\" (renowned for its old-fashioned design), but Williams wanted the paper to look more contemporary. He commissioned an updated design, but this was rejected by Coleman.", "In 1980, after a strike which had taken the paper (along with NME) out of publication for a period, Williams left MM. Coleman promoted Michael Oldfield from the design staff to day-to-day editor, and, for a while, took it back where it had been, with news of a line-up change in Jethro Tull replacing features about Andy Warhol, Gang of Four and Factory Records on the cover. Several journalists, such as Chris Bohn and Vivien Goldman, moved to NME, while Jon Savage joined the new magazine The Face. Coleman left in 1981, the paper's design was updated, but sales and prestige were at a low ebb through the early 1980s, with NME dominant."]}, {"page": "The Specials (album)", "response": ["On the other hand, Vivien Goldman in Melody Maker was disappointed, observing that \"this album's drawbacks are exposed all the more vividly in the light of its missed potential\u00a0... producer Elvis Costello seems incapable of producing a rhythm\u2014by that I mean pop, as well as reggae\". The review expanded upon this comment, saying, \"A key word is pace. The Specials\u2014a great band to party to\u2014can't sustain the shock of having the speed of certain numbers halved. When the pace on record doubles\u2014as in 'Too Much Too Young'\u2014The Specials suddenly make sense\". Goldman also criticised the lack of understanding of a female point of view in certain songs, but concluded on a positive note: \"Perhaps I'm extra critical, because I (still) have great hopes for the future of The Specials\". Sounds agreed that the album had not fulfilled its potential, saying, \"There are no rough edges to upset you, nothing new to shock you\u00a0... The Specials seem to have lost the attacking, forward-looking, forward moving, almost militant momentum that was witnessed and promised from the beginning\"."]}, {"page": "Vincent Ford", "response": ["While in Trenchtown in the late 1970s, Marley biographer Vivien Goldman asked Ford point-blank \"Was it you?\" who wrote the songs. Ford never responded to the question directly, answering \"Well, what do you think?\" Goldman described Ford as \"an unbroken link to a generation, many of whom are now gone\", reminiscing that \"The last time I saw him he was going into a Marley family gig in Kingston, and he was just borne along on a wave of youth, all admiring him and understanding what he\u2019d come to represent.\" Given the collaborative nature of reggae, Goldman described how \"That song may very well have been a conversation that they had sitting around one night.

In 2014 in the Phoenix New Times, David Accomazzo wrote \"Dave Robinson, who constructed the tracklist for Legend, [said that] the tracklist for Legend deliberately was designed to appeal to white audiences.

Goldman adds that Martyn's voice \"performs abrupt disappearances, bobbing up immediately at some other angle to the ears.\"", "Mark Prendergast of Melody Maker commented that Martyn \"seems fated to inspire madness and mayhem, no matter how utterly shambolic the circumstances he finds himself in,\" feeling this may be due to his uniquely \"foggy\" voice and ability to \"trick out what are invariably simple songs with ravishing detail.\" In Sounds, Vivien Goldman hailed Blackwell's deeply sympathetic production and the inventive music, praising Martyn for carrying the \"spirit of John Cale/Terry Riley music expansion\", while feeling he is \"not taken as seriously as he should be\".
