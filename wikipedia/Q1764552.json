It would take him from the Cheynes\u2014with whom he supported early gigs by the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds\u2014to stints in the Bo Street Runners, where he replaced original drummer Nigel Hutchinson, who had enjoyed brief television fame on Ready Steady Go!. However, by April 1965, when Fleetwood joined the band, it was fading into obscurity. By February 1966, Bardens, who had left the group, called on Fleetwood to join his new band, the Peter Bs, which soon expanded to become Shotgun Express (with Rod Stewart).

They then recruited keyboardist Peter Bardens and after an initial gig to fulfill a Bardens commitment under the name Peter Bardens' On, they changed their name to Camel. Their first gig under that name was at Waltham Forest Technical College, London supporting Wishbone Ash in December 1971.", "In 1992, a man named Roy Clay approached former Camel drummer Andy Ward and claimed to be a fan of the band as well as an experienced music manager. Clay proposed a Camel reunion tour; Ward supported the scheme but Peter Bardens was the only other former member to show interest. Clay then enlisted some former members of Caravan and attempted to promote the band as a legitimate new lineup of Camel, but a copyright challenge from Latimer forced a name change. Under the name Mirage, this group conducted a short tour in late 1994 and released a live album. The members of Mirage were never compensated, and Clay's fraudulent practices were addressed in a 1995 song by Caravan. Also under Clay's management, Bardens led another band under the name Mirage that released a live album in 1996. Clay also sold counterfeit Camel merchandise, and several years later was convicted of fraud and forgery.

Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy \"I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round\", before disbanding. Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket, and said \"I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people's music.

This lineup proved to be temporary, as Lynott and Cann did not get on personally, and Gee was under contract to another record label.

A few days after the Ray Davies Quartet supported Cyril Stapleton at the Lyceum Ballroom on New Year's Eve, Davies, while still remaining in the Quartet, joined the Dave Hunt Band which briefly included Charlie Watts on drums.
