Various comical misunderstandings arise, primarily aimed at youngsters. Arthur White replaced Paddick for the second run of thirteen episodes. Throughout both series, Hal was played by Ellis Jones, with Roy Barraclough as his long-suffering boss, Mr Cobbledick."]}, {"page": "The Squirrels (TV series)", "response": ["* Ellis Jones as Burke"]}, {"page": "Ellis Jones", "response": ["Ellis Jones may refer to:", "* Ellis Jones (sociologist) (born 1970), American sociologist and author", "* Ellis Jones (actor) (born 1943), British actor", "* Ellis Jones (American football) (1921\u20132002), American football player", "* Ellis Jones (footballer) (born 2003), English soccer player"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Ellis Jones, actor, was born in Petersfield"]}, {"page": "BBC2 Playhouse", "response": ["| Robert UrquhartPhilip MadocAlan LakeBrendan PriceBrendan BarryEllis Jones"]}]}}
