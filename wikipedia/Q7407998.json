Despite this Tisdale managed to sign Sam Parkin and Doug Bergqvist."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Davis (footballer)", "response": ["A few days after his death, Swindon dedicated their 4\u20130 win over Notts County to Davis, with Davis's mother making a speech in front of the Swindon fans before the kick-off. Additionally, Swindon Town took part in a memorial match with his local club Redditch United; Swindon won 2\u20131 with Sam Parkin scoring the goals. Manchester United paid tribute to him during their 2003 FA Community Shield victory against Arsenal, with both teams wearing black armbands during the match. At the suggestion of captain Roy Keane, United also paid tribute to him after their victory in the 2004 FA Cup Final, when after the final whistle and before the presentation they changed into shirts printed with Davis's name and squad number, 36. Watford commemorated Davis in their next match after his death, a 1\u20130 win over AFC Bournemouth in the League Cup, with both teams wearing black armbands, the captains placing wreathes and the entire stadium holding a minute's silence before kick-off; at full time, Davis' friend and teammate, Danny Webber, took off his shirt to reveal a vest printed with Davis' name and Watford squad number. England's game against Croatia on 20 August was also preceded by a minute's silence in memory of Davis and former coach Ray Harford, who had died the same day as Davis."]}, {"page": "Rory Fallon", "response": ["Despite the departure of Tommy Mooney, Fallon found himself regularly on the bench in the 2004\u201305 season. He was loaned out to Yeovil Town to increase his confidence and he scored on his debut against Scunthorpe United. He failed to score in the remainder of the season, but a red card for kicking Huddersfield Town defender David Mirfin in the face meant he missed the opening two games of the following season. After Sam Parkin was sold in summer 2005, Fallon was given greater opportunities to play at Swindon, scoring on his return to action against Nottingham Forest."]}, {"page": "Jack Smith (footballer, born 1983)", "response": ["After originally being offered as a makeweight in a rejected bid to take Sam Parkin to Watford, Smith signed with Swindon Town a free transfer in July 2005, signing a one-year deal. Despite being right-footed, Smith made his debut on the left side of defence on the opening day of the season, in a 2\u20130 defeat at Barnsley. Doing a steady job without being outstanding, he remained the first choice in this position until retiring with a groin strain during a 0\u20130 draw at Brentford in October \u2013 a result that brought to an end a club record run of eight successive defeats, but an injury that kept Smith out of action for almost a month."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["Ipswich were still financially recovering from administration, with limited funds restricting the playing budget. Magilton's first signing as manager saw Alex Bruce arrive from Birmingham City on a free transfer on 2 August 2006. Ian Westlake was sold to Leeds United on 4 August for a reported fee of \u00a3400,000, potentially rising to \u00a3500,000 with add-ons, in a deal which also saw Dan Harding move in the other direction, signing a three-year deal with Ipswich. French midfielder Sylvain Legwinski also joined on a free transfer from Fulham on 31 August, signing a two year contract with the club. Stikers Sam Parkin and Nicky Forster also debarted for fees, joining Luton Town and Hull City respectively before the end of August.
