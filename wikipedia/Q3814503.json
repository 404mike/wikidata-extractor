Thompson investigated the mentalit\u00e9 of the crowd, to reveal the thinking underpinning the riots. Thompson investigated how in a particular situation rural England in the 18th century, a crowd of peasants made the decision to riot. Thompson acknowledged that \"riots were triggered off by soaring prices, by malpractices among dealers, or by hunger. But these grievances operated within a popular consensus as to what were legitimate and what were illegitimate practices\" in marketing, milling, and baking, for example. \"This in its turn was grounded upon a consistent traditional view of social norms and obligations, of the proper economic functions of several parties within the community, which, taken together, can be said to constitute the moral economy of the poor. An outrage to these moral assumptions, quite as much as actual deprivation, was the usual occasion for direct action.\" According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to \"set the price\" of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional \"fair price\" was more important to the community than a \"free\" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village."]}, {"page": "Alfred Cobban", "response": ["A photograph of Alfred Cobban, a complete list of his publications, and an essay on his life and work by C.V.
