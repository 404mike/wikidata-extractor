Bigden had been \"drummer for such stars as Tom Jones, Cilla Black, Shirley Bassey, Sir Cliff Richard, Kylie Minogue, Eartha Kitt, Lionel Richie, Andy Williams and Tony Bennett\", as well as for St\u00e9phane Grappelli on at least one of his albums.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Only Fools and Horses", "response": ["Only Fools and Horses has separate theme songs for the opening and closing credits, \"Only Fools and Horses\" and \"Hooky Street\", respectively. The original theme tune was produced by Ronnie Hazlehurst and recorded on 6 August 1981 at Lime Grove Studios. Alf Bigden, Paul Westwood, Don Hunt, John Dean, Judd Proctor, Eddie Mordue, and Rex Morris were hired to play the music. The tune was changed after the first series, and the new one was written by John Sullivan (he disliked the tune for the first series, and his new one explained the show's title), and Hazlehurst conducted it. It was recorded at Lime Grove on 11 May 1982, with musicians John Horler, Dave Richmond, Bigden, and Proctor. Sullivan had intended Chas & Dave to sing it because they had enjoyed success with the \"Rockney\" style, a mixture of rock n' roll and traditional Cockney music. Sullivan was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt. Despite the creation of a new theme tune, the original one remained in occasional use. Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show, performing the closing credits song for the 1989 episode \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\". Both songs are performed by Sullivan himself, and not \u2013 as is sometimes thought \u2013 by Nicholas Lyndhurst."]}, {"page": "The King's Singers", "response": ["|Drums: Alf Bigden, keyboard: Steve Gray, bass: Brian Odges (Holy Moses)"]}, {"page": "Bigden", "response": ["* Alf Bigden (1932\u20132007), British drummer"]}]}}
