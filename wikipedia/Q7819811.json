The team was much more settled in general, and Lincoln finished in fourth place; Horne and left-half George Whyte were both ever-present in 42 League and 5 FA Cup matches. He returned to the forward line during the latter part of the season. Against Accrington Stanley in March 1935, he took a ball in the face followed by a tackle which left his face bloodied, but he returned after 13 minutes' treatment and set up the only goal of the game for Tommy Robinson; two weeks later, the Daily Express dubbed him \"the star of Lincoln attack\" for creating two first-half goals for Robinson against Stockport County. When he resumed his right-half duties, the Lincolnshire Echo wrote that \"on the team captain's recent displays one can well imagine that the management wish they could play him in two or three positions at once, but he can be relied upon to continue a dominating figure at right half.\""]}]}}
