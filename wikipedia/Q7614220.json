He died after being injured in a car crash in Ibiza, Spain.\nWalsh began his radio career at the first soul music pirate radio station, Radio Invicta, alongside his friend, Bob Tomalski. From there he moved on to JFM, a London soul pirate station, where his style first began to shine through. Walsh also guested on Dave Brown's soul show once a month on BBC Radio Medway, which later became BBC Radio Kent. He then decided that if he was to further his career he would have to be completely legal, and leave pirate radio. An opportunity came up at the new independent local radio station, County Sound in Guildford.\nHe returned to London with the launch of Radio London's Soul Night Out. At the same time he was approached by Capital Radio, having covered one Saturday on Greg Edwards's Soul Spectrum when Edwards was ill. This led to six months on Capital Radio with a slot in the small hours of Sunday. The two stations became uneasy about sharing the same DJ, and eventually Walsh went to BBC Radio London to host the Sunday 7-9pm show, later adding a second slot on Mondays.\nAlthough he made an impact in the radio world, Walsh will be best remembered for his live work in nightclubs. His 1987 version of The Fatback Band's \"I Found Lovin'\" was archetypal of the genre of 'South London Soul'. Walsh worked with Tony Blackburn to bring soul music to a wider audience, and shortly before his death he co-presented a dance programme Boogie Box on Music Box, alongside Michaela Strachan.\nOn 29 June 1988, Walsh was injured in a car crash in Ibiza, where he was filming a music video. He returned to London where he underwent surgery on his broken leg, and died of heart failure on 3 July following the surgery, leaving a wife and three children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fatback Band", "response": ["In 1980, Fatback had a pair of their biggest hits with \"Gotta Get My Hands on Some (Money)\" and \"Backstrokin'\".

In the 1980s, soul emerged as a major influence on British pop music, with flourishing soul scenes in major cities like London and Manchester, the latter known for being part of the Northern Soul scene which included venues such as the Twisted Wheel and the Wigan Casino. Many black artists were supported by local radio stations (both licensed and pirate) and radio presenters/DJs like Robbie Vincent, Chris Hill and Steve Walsh.A.
