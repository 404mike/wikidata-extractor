The club was inserted into the second division and became inaugural members of the league after finishing runner-up in the South Group. Saint-\u00c9tienne remained in Division 2 for four more seasons before earning promotion to Division 1 for the 1938\u201339 season under the leadership of the Englishman Teddy Duckworth. However, the team's debut appearance in the first division was short-lived due to the onset of World War II. Saint-\u00c9tienne returned to the first division after the war under the Austrian-born Frenchman Ignace Tax and surprised many by finishing runner-up to Lille in the first season after the war. The club failed to improve upon that finish in following seasons under Tax and, ahead of the 1950\u201351 season, Tax was let go and replaced by former Saint-\u00c9tienne player Jean Snella.", "| Teddy Duckworth", "| Teddy Duckworth"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Hogan", "response": ["In Switzerland he coached in about 1924 Young Boys Berne.
