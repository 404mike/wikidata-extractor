Noted for his shot stopping abilities, Pilkington notably played in the Premier League for Manchester United before dropping down to the English Football League, where he played in nearly 350 games in his time at Mansfield Town and Notts County, helping Mansfield win promotion out of the Third Division in 2001\u201302. He spent five years with Mansfield and then another ten years over two spells with Notts County; at both clubs he was usually the first choice keeper, rather than a back-up keeper as he was at most other clubs. He has also represented Rochdale, Rotherham United, Celtic, Port Vale, Aberystwyth Town, Wigan Athletic and Luton Town.\nFollowing his retirement, Pilkington moved into coaching and has worked as a goalkeeping coach for Ilkeston, Notts County, Luton Town, and Cambridge United. During the 2018\u201319 season, he briefly came out of retirement to act as a back-up keeper for Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luton Town F.C.", "response": ["* Goalkeeper coach: Kevin Pilkington"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|2008 ||  Kevin Pilkington "]}, {"page": "Darren Huckerby", "response": ["The striker's pace and dribbling ability, combined with a very successful partnership with Dion Dublin saw Huckerby play a key role at Coventry. Huckerby and Dublin's partnership did not go unnoticed and earned Huckerby a call up to the England B squad, whilst Dublin managed call ups to the full squad, under Glenn Hoddle. Huckerby played a major role in Coventry's Premier League survival,  culminating with a final day 2\u20131 win at Tottenham Hotspur in 1997. His success with the Sky Blues continued throughout the following season as Coventry enjoyed a ten-game unbeaten run and reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup, narrowly losing on penalties to Sheffield United. Huckerby scored several goals, most notably the winner in a 3\u20132 victory over Manchester United at Highfield Road, a dazzling run past a few defenders before slotting past Kevin Pilkington. He notched up 14 goals that season, his best Premier League return of goals."]}, {"page": "Russell Hoult", "response": ["In February 2008 Hoult joined Notts County on loan until the end of the season, following an injury to regular keeper Kevin Pilkington. He kept a clean sheet in the 0\u20130 draw away at Peterborough United in March, making the League Two Team of the Week. He made 14 appearances for the club, keeping seven clean sheets and helping the club to avoid relegation. He was released at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, following Stoke's promotion to the Premiership. On 1 July 2008, Hoult returned to Notts County on a permanent basis, signing a two-year contract with the club. He played the first three games of the 2009\u201310 season for Notts County, before being replaced by new signing Kasper Schmeichel for the home game against Dagenham & Redbridge. On 16 September 2009, Darlington manager Colin Todd signed Hoult on loan for a month as Todd felt that permanent Quakers keeper David Knight needed a break after a tough start to the season. Todd was sacked during Hoult's loan and he was recalled by Notts County at the end of his month spell. He had played five games for Darlington. On 10 May 2010, it was announced that he had been released by Notts County along with seven other players."]}, {"page": "Jason White (footballer, born 1984)", "response": ["White joined Third Division side Mansfield Town after being released by First Division side Nottingham Forest at the age of 16 and made his debut in September 2002 against Cheltenham Town when he came on as a substitute to replace the injured Kevin Pilkington.

A highlight of this season was helping Mansfield defeat Championship side Stoke City on penalties in the League Cup; White saved one of Stoke's penalty attempts from Carl Hoefkens. But he was still offered a new contract in April 2006 and began the 2006\u201307 season in goal. He went on to make 33 appearances that season.

He debuted as an 82nd-minute substitute in their 3\u20130 home win over Torquay United on 13 August 2005.

After Musselwhite and Pilkington moved on in the summer, Goodlad's only competition for the number one jersey came from Irishman Dean Delany, also aged 20.
