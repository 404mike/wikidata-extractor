Two years later, in 1658, Dhone was charged by James Chaloner, the new Governor of the Island, of misappropriating funds that were reserved for the support of the grammar schools and for the augmentation of the salary of poorer clergy on the Island. Facing imprisonment, Dhone and his eldest son George fled to England. Dhone's estates were confiscated and his brother Deemster John Christian was imprisoned for helping him to escape the Island. Dhone was eventually arrested in London in 1660. After serving a year of imprisonment he returned to Mann, hoping that his offence against the Earl of Derby would be condoned under the Act of Indemnity of 1661; but, anxious to punish his conduct, Charles Stanley, 8th Earl of Derby ordered his attrest. At his trial, Dhone refused to plead, and the House of Keys declared that his life and property were at the mercy of the Lord of Mann. The Deemsters then passed sentence, and Dhone was executed by shooting at Hango Hill (near what is now Janet's Corner, Castletown), on 2 January 1663 on charges of high treason.
