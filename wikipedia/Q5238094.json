In the six months since the previous list, she had gained a remarkable 190 rating points. Judit's quiet and modest demeanour at the board contrasted with the intensity of her playing style. David Norwood, British GM, in recalling Judit beating him when he was an established player and she was just a child, described her as \"this cute little auburn-haired monster who crushed you.\" British journalist Dominic Lawson wrote about 12-year-old Judit's \"killer\" eyes and how she would stare at her opponent: \"The irises are so grey so dark they are almost indistinguishable from the pupils. Set against her long red hair, the effect is striking.\""]}, {"page": "Steve Davis", "response": ["Davis has published a number of other books.

In 1982, Nunn concluded his analysis of the Taimanov with the words, \"Black badly needs a new idea against 8.Bb5+ and 9.a4 to keep the Benoni in business\"; two years later, he had given up the opening altogether. Other players such as Psakhis resorted to using the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6, only playing 3...c5 in response to 3.Nf3 to avoid the Taimanov, while choosing an entirely different opening against 3.Nc3. The damage this variation did to the opening's reputation led David Norwood to rechristen it the \"Flick-Knife Attack.\""]}, {"page": "Category talk:Chess players", "response": ["David Norwoodnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Oxford University Chess Club", "response": ["* David Norwood"]}, {"page": "Richard Farleigh", "response": ["Farleigh left Australia in the nineties.
