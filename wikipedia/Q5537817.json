Chapman (born 23 October 1886, deceased) was a Scottish professional footballer. He initially played as a centre half during his early career before becoming a centre forward. Born in Broxburn, he started his career with Raith Rovers and later assisted Heart of Midlothian. In 1908, Chapman moved to England to play for Blackburn Rovers in the Football League First Division and made 67 league appearances during two seasons with the club. He returned to Scotland in 1910 when he was signed by Rangers and spent one season with the Glasgow club. Chapman rejoined Blackburn in 1911 and remained with the Ewood Park club for the next four seasons, scoring 29 goals in 71 league matches. His time at Blackburn was curtailed by the outbreak of the First World War, which brought a halt to English competitive football in 1915. When competitive football recommenced, Chapman signed with Lancashire Combination side Accrington Stanley.During the 1915\u201316 season, Chapman appeared as a guest player in three wartime matches for Burnley, in which he scored three goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Chapman (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Chapman (c. 1559\u20131634) was an English dramatist, translator, and poet.", "George Chapman may also refer to:", "* George Chapman (murderer) (1865\u20131903), Polish-born English serial killer aka Sverin Antoniovich Klosowski", "* George Chapman (healer) (1921\u20132006), British trance healer and medium", "* George Chapman (cricketer) (1904\u20131986), Australian cricketer", "* George Chapman (footballer, born 1886) (1886\u2013?), Scottish footballer with Blackburn Rovers and Rangers", "* George Chapman (footballer, born 1920) (1920\u20131998), English footballer with Brighton & Hove Albion", "* George Chapman (businessman), businessman from Queensland, Australia", "* George Chapman (party president) (born 1927), New Zealand political leader"]}, {"page": "George Chapman (footballer born 1886)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Chapman (footballer, born 1886)"]}]}}
