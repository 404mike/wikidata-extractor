In the early 18th century, Benjamin Robins, an English mathematician, realized that an elongated bullet would retain the momentum and kinetic energy of a musket ball, but would slice through the air with greater ease. The black powder used in early muzzle-loading rifles quickly fouled the barrel, making loading slower and more difficult. The greater range of the rifle was considered to be of little practical use, since the smoke from black powder quickly obscured the battlefield and made it almost impossible to aim the weapon from a distance. Since musketeers could not afford to take the time to stop and clean their barrels in the middle of a battle, rifles were limited to use by sharpshooters and non-military uses like hunting."]}, {"page": "Wind tunnel", "response": ["English military engineer and mathematician Benjamin Robins (1707\u20131751) invented a whirling arm apparatus to determine dragJames Wilson, ed., Mathematical Tracts of the late Benjamin Robins, Esq; \u2026 (London, England:  J.

Bronze \u2013 an alloy of 10 parts copper to one part tin \u2013 was preferred for cannons because it was lighter than iron and more durable. At that time, cannons were cast hollow around a core and the core often moved within the mold, producing an imperfect bore. This problem was solved at The Hague foundry in 1747. Jean Maritz began casting guns as a single, solid block, and then drilling the bore on a large machine. The Dutch tried to maintain the secret, but the new process soon became widely known in Europe. After Maritz's invention, a cannon could be manufactured with a better-aligned bore and tighter tolerances. This resulted in less windage \u2013 the gap between the cannonball and the bore \u2013 which meant less gas pressure escaped, so that smaller gunpowder charges could hurl the projectile farther and more accurately.
