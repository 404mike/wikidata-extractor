After seeing action as a junior office in naval brigades during both the Anglo-Egyptian War and the Mahdist War, he commanded a cruiser in operational service during the Second Boer War. As a flag officer he commanded the Plymouth Division of the Home Fleet, the 5th Cruiser Squadron, the Atlantic Fleet and then the 3rd Battle Squadron.\nIn April 1913 Montenegro seized control of Scutari in the latest round of hostilities between the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro during the closing stages of the First Balkan War. In April 1913 Burney was sent as temporary Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet to Antivari on the coast of Montenegro to take command of the international naval force despatched to deal with this situation. On arrival he blockaded Antivari and then also commanded the international force occupying Scutari as part of its transition to Albanian control. He was well rewarded with honours for the success of this mission.\nOn the outbreak of the First World War Burney became Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet. In that role he ensured the safe passage of the British Expeditionary Force to France. He went on to be commander of the 1st Battle Squadron commanding the squadron at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, where his flagship HMS Marlborough was the first ship to engage the Germans but was later torpedoed. He was appointed Second Sea Lord in November 1916 but removed on the grounds of his age in September 1917 and appointed Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Scotland instead. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth after the War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1929", "response": ["* June 5 \u2013 Sir Cecil Burney, British admiral of the fleet (b. 1858)"]}, {"page": "SMS Zr\u00ednyi", "response": ["In 1913, Zr\u00ednyi participated in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea to protest the Balkan Wars.
