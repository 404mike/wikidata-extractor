Many of these have made a mockery of the soldier's oath of obedience to military orders. When it suits their purpose they say they had to obey; when confronted with Hitler's brutal crimes which are shown to have been within their general knowledge, they say they disobeyed. The truth is they actively participated in all these crimes, or sat silent and acquiescent, witnessing the commission of crimes on a scale larger and more shocking than the world has ever had the misfortune to know.\""]}, {"page": "Erich von Manstein", "response": ["Manstein faced seventeen charges at the trial, three of which pertained to events in Poland and fourteen regarding events in the Soviet Union. Charges included maltreatment of prisoners of war, co-operation with the Einsatzgruppe D in killing Jewish residents of the Crimea, and disregarding the welfare of civilians by using \"scorched earth\" tactics while retreating from the Soviet Union. The prosecution, led by senior counsel Arthur Comyns Carr, used an order Manstein had signed on 20 November 1941, based on the Severity Order that had been issued by Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau, to build their case that Manstein had known about and was complicit with the genocide. The order called for the elimination of the \"Jewish Bolshevik system\" and the \"harsh punishment of Jewry\"."]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Arthur Comyns Carr, Liberal MP 1923\u201324, President of the Liberal Party 1958\u201359."]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["* Arthur Comyns Carr, Islington East, 1923\u201324"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Arthur Comyns Carr"]}, {"page": "Islington East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Arthur Comyns Carr"]}, {"page": "Comyns", "response": ["* Arthur Comyns Carr (1882\u20131965), English politician "]}, {"page": "Robert Tasker", "response": ["Tasker was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate at the 1923 general election, when he failed to be elected at Bethnal Green North East.
