He began working for Country Life as a columnist and wrote and illustrated the children's book The Adventures of Thomas Trout (1939). In 1955 he published To Be a Fisherman; a work about the experiences of being an angler. In 1957 his children's novel, The Pigeon and the Boy, was published by Geoffrey Bles. The work tells the story of a boy from a small English village who is taught how to train racing pigeons by his father. He grows up and becomes a young soldier in the British Army in France during World War II. He uses his talent with pigeons from his childhood to aid in the war against the Nazis; ultimately using his own pigeon to send a critical message across the English Channel. His third and final book, Pindar: a dog to remember (1975), was described by James Fergusson in The Independent as \"a remarkably unselfconscious biography of a yellow labrador\". He also published two volumes of poetry."]}]}}
