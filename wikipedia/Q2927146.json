A few Maroons would run out into view of the British and then run in the direction of fellow Maroons who were hidden and would attack. After falling into these ambushes several times, the British retaliated. According to planter Bryan Edwards, who wrote his narrative half a century later, Captain Stoddart \"found the huts in which the negroes were asleep\", and \"fired upon them so briskly, that many were slain in their habitations\".

The image has an African woman who like many images of Venus Anadyomene stands on an opened half-shell, but this black Venus is surrounded by white cherubs and moves across the Middle Passage, urged on by Triton. Central allegorical tenets of the image are in turn based on a poem by Isaac Teale, \"The Sable Venus: An Ode\" (included in Edwards' book) which, according to Dan Chiasson, who reviewed Lewis's collection in The New Yorker, \"celebrates the pleasures of raping slave women, since black and white\u2014Sable Venus and Botticelli's Venus\u2014are, after all, the same 'at night'.

Thistlewood's observations were one of the first continuous weather records outside of Europe and the United States.

Formal monitoring of hurricanes in Jamaica began with the formation of the Jamaican Weather Service in Kingston in 1880. Between its formation and 1896, the agency observed 38\u00a0tropical depressions and issued hurricane warnings three times.  Tropical cyclones were of great importance to colonial interests due to their effects on crops and the slave trade."]}]}}
