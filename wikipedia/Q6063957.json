He was educated at a local elementary school, and in 1908, at 13 years of age, he began working at the Dare Colliery, Cwmparc. He attended evening classes in economics and history in order to improve his education, and in 1918 he joined the Labour Party.\nIn 1922 he was promoted to the position of checkweighman at Cwm-parc. He was a prominent figure within the South Wales Miners' Federation and the National Union of Mineworkers for more than 30 years and held a number of offices in the Park and Dare Lodge, the largest in the south Wales coalfield. During the 1926 coalminers' strike Thomas was sentenced to three months imprisonment as the chairman of the Park and Dare Lodge as a result of his involvement in industrial disturbances.\nHe was elected a member of the Rhondda Borough Council in 1928, chaired many of its committees and served as its chairman in 1938\u201339.
