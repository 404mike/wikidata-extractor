He met producer Jeremy Bolt and they founded Impact Pictures in 1992, looking to raise money for Anderson's feature film debut as director, from an action crime drama script of his own, called Shopping.

The censors of the British Board of Film Classification were not happy with the film's violence of and delayed its release for months. When it was eventually released, critics panned it and some cinemas decided to ban it for promoting an \"irresponsible\" outlook. In the United States it received only an edited, direct-to-video release two years later. Anderson credits Shopping for inspiring Channel Four Films, who had financed it, to also finance the more successful Shallow Grave and Trainspotting films by Danny Boyle, which in turn, he believes, made critics reassess his film in more positive light in later years, as one of the first in a new wave of British films concerning its youth. Shopping is Anderson's one and only British film, as he grew up watching American and mainland European movies, never imagining himself a British filmmaker.
