In early life Peacock did not show any precocity of genius, and was more remarkable for daring feats of climbing than for any special attachment to study. Initially, he received his elementary education from his father and then at Sedbergh School, and at 17 years of age, he was sent to Richmond School under James Tate, a graduate of Cambridge University. At this school he distinguished himself greatly both in classics and in the rather elementary mathematics then required for entrance at Cambridge. In 1809 he became a student of Trinity College, Cambridge."]}, {"page": "John Disney (antiquarian)", "response": ["Building on a catalogue of the antiquarian collection made by his father, and supplemented by James Tate, Disney published in 1846 as Museum Disneianum.
