However, Keane was eventually brought back into the team to replace Jackson, and later made the position his own when Luton Town fan favourite Mick Harford replaced Blackwell as manager in January 2008. Harford made Keane club captain, but the price of administration condemned Luton to another relegation, this time to League Two. Keane won the Player of the Season award at the end of the season, as well as the Players' Player of the Year and Internet Player of the Season award."]}, {"page": "Richard Jackson", "response": ["Richard Jackson may refer to:", "*Richard Jackson (theatrical producer) (born 1932), British theatrical producer and agent", "*Richard Jackson (artist) (born 1939), American contemporary artist", "*Richard Jackson (choreographer) (born 1979), choreographer for Lady Gaga and reality television personality", "*Richard Jackson (Sudbury MP) (1688\u20131768), British MP for Sudbury in 1734", "*Richard Jackson (colonial agent) (c. 1721\u20131787), British lawyer, colonial agent and politician", "*Richard Jackson (Coleraine MP) (c.\u20091729\u20131789), Irish politician, MP for Coleraine 1751\u20131789", "*Richard Jackson Jr. (1764\u20131838), United States Representative from Rhode Island", "*Richard Jackson (Liberal politician) (1850\u20131938), British Member of Parliament for Greenwich, 1906\u20131910", "*Richard Jackson (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u2013?), English footballer for Rotherham", "*Richard Jackson (cricketer) (born 1979), English cricketer", "*Richard Jackson (footballer, born 1980), English footballer for Derby County", "*Sir Richard Jackson (police officer) (1902\u20131975), Assistant Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, 1953\u20131963", "*Richard Jackson (biochemist), biochemist and cell biologist", "*Richard Jackson (bishop) (born 1961), Church of England Bishop of Lewes"]}, {"page": "Jackson (name)", "response": ["*Richard Jackson (colonial agent) (c. 1721 \u2013 1787), British politician", "*Richard Jackson, Jr. (1764\u20131838), U.S. Representative from Rhode Island", "*Richard Jackson (born 1937), NASCAR race team owner", "*Richard Jackson (footballer, born 1900), English footballer", "*Richard Jackson (footballer, born 1980), English footballer", "*Richard Jackson (artist) (born 1939), American artist", "*Richard Jackson (artist) (born 1939), American artist"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|26||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Richard Jackson", "| 21 August 2008 ||  Richard Jackson || Hereford United ||align=\"right\"| Free || style=\"text-align:center;\"|"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| Richard Jackson", "|align=\"left\"|27||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Richard Jackson"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|Richard Jackson"]}, {"page": "Richard Jackson (footballer born 1980)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Jackson (footballer, born 1980)"]}]}}
