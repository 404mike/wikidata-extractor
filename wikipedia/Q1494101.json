The 1967 keynote address to the inaugural meeting of the American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) by Margaret Mead, who had been a participant at the Macy Conferences, is a defining moment in its development. Mead characterised \"cybernetics as a way of looking at things and as a language for expressing what one sees\", calling on cyberneticians to assume responsibility for the social consequences of the language of cybernetics and the development of cybernetic systems.Krippendorff, K. (2008). \"Cybernetics's Reflexive Turns\". Cybernetics and Human Knowing, 15 (3\u20134), 173\u2013184. Mead's paper concluded with a proposal directed at the ASC itself, that it organise itself in the light of the ideas with which it was concerned. That is, the practice of cybernetics by the ASC should be subject to cybernetic critique, an idea returned to by Ranulph Glanville in his time as president of the society.Glanville, Ranulph. \"Introduction: A Conference Doing the Cybernetics of Cybernetics.\" Kybernetes 40, no. 7/8 (2011): 952\u2013963.Glanville, Ranulph, ed.
