As organisms exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.As recounted in Simon Winchester, The Map that Changed the World (New York: HarperCollins, 2001) pp. 59\u201391."]}, {"page": "Krakatoa", "response": ["Simon Winchester maintains, in his 2003 book Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883, that the 1680 eruption was depicted in an eighteenth-century etching by Dutch cartographer Jan van Schley called Het Brandende Eiland, \"The Burning Island,\" writing that \"it was a depiction, without a doubt, of the otherwise little-chronicled eruption that supposedly took place in 1680.\""]}, {"page": "Tristan da Cunha", "response": ["Tristan da Cunha's isolation has led to development of its own dialect of English.
