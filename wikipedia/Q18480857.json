On leaving London, he conducted \u201ca lengthy tour of the provinces, visiting Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester, Liverpool, Ireland and Scotland\u201d (Gauld, 1992, p.204). Although, from time to time, Lafontaine \u2018treated\u2019 individuals, he was principally what Gauld (1992, p.203) describes as a \u201cmagnetic demonstrator\u201d; and, on most of the occasions in which he had provided \u2018treatment\u2019, the events were intended to be demonstrations, rather than the expression of the activities of a professional therapist.In relation to Lafontaine's claim to have supplied mesmeric anaesthesia for surgery, on occasion, whilst he was in England, Gauld (1992, p.204) notes that, in January 1842, whilst in Sheffield, Lafontaine (at Lafontaine (1866, I, p.320-321) claims to have provided the mesmeric anaesthesia for surgeon George Calvert Holland (1801-1865), \"for the painless amputation of a leg\". However, in relation to constant issue of the veracity of Lafontaine\u2019s own (otherwise unreported) claims being open to question, it is important to note that the surgeon in question (Holland, 1848) makes no mention whatsoever of such an astonishing event \u2014 and, moreover, George Sandby (1848, pp.47-54) makes no mention of any such event within his exhaustive list of operations under mesmeric anaesthesia compiled six years later."]}, {"page": "Sheffield Trades and Labour Council", "response": ["Charles Bagshaw, the local secretary of the Razor Smiths' Union, attempted to bring the parties together for conciliation, but Harrison refused this.  In response to his threat of litigation, a meeting of local trade unions was held in Sheffield's Town Hall on 10 November 1858.  The meeting, chaired by George Calvert Holland, passed a resolution calling for the foundation of a local trades council.  A committee was appointed to this end, which also managed to get Harrison to withdraw the charges against the printers.  The committee called a series of further meetings, which finally agreed its rules and the title of Association of Organised Trades of Sheffield and Neighbourhood on 22 June 1859.
