Alexander Binnie, who was the Waterworks Engineer for Bradford at the time, and Professor Alexander Henry Green, a geologist from Oxford, visited the area, and Green advised Binnie that the valley was suitable for the construction of large dams. The Bradford Corporation Water Act 1890 was obtained on 14 August 1890, authorising the construction of four dams, but in the meantime, Binnie had moved on to work for London County Council as their Chief Engineer, and was replaced by James Watson of Dundee. A second Act of Parliament was obtained on 27 June 1892, by which time the four reservoirs were Angram, Haden Carr, High Woodale and Gouthwaite. Gouthwaite Reservoir was designed as a compensation reservoir, to maintain flows in the Nidd further down the valley."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| Alexander Henry Green||04/06/1886||10 October 1832 \u2013 19 August 1896"]}, {"page": "Louis Compton Miall", "response": ["*with Thomas Edward Thorpe, Alexander Henry Green, Arthur William R\u00fccker and Alfred Marshall: "]}, {"page": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford", "response": ["* Alexander Henry Green"]}]}}
