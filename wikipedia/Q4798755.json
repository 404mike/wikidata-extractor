He was the eldest son of Arthur French MP and Alicia Magenis, daughter of Richard Magenis of Dublin and sister of Richard Magenis. He married Margaret Costello, daughter of Edmond Costello of Edmondstown, County Mayo,  and had nine children, including Arthur French, 1st Baron de Freyne, John, 2nd Baron  and Charles, 3rd Baron.\nIn 1783, he was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) for Roscommon County in the Irish House of Commons. After the Act of Union in 1801 he represented Roscommon in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. He was alleged to have been offered an Earldom  if he would support the Union of Ireland with Great Britain but refused the honour. Later he also refused a Barony  with no strings attached, although in time three of his sons would hold the title Baron de Freyne.  The  Crown was frequently irritated by French's demands for offices and favours for his brothers and sons,  although such behaviour was entirely typical of an Irish politician at the time.\nA critic of the policy of collective fines as a deterrent to the illicit distillation of poteen, he incurred the wrath of Chief Secretary of Ireland Robert Peel who called him \"an Abominable fellow\", but his enormous popularity in Roscommon meant that he could not be ignored.  He also criticized the continuation of martial law in Ireland.\nBy 1817 he was complaining of ill-health: he died on 24 November 1820. One report at the time states that he had died \"from excessive fox hunting\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur French, 1st Baron de Freyne", "response": ["Arthur French, 1st Baron de Freyne and de Freyne (1786 \u2013 29 September 1856) was an Anglo-Irish peer and Member of Parliament.", "De Freyne was the eldest son of Arthur French of Frenchpark and his wife Margaret Costello of Edmondstown.
