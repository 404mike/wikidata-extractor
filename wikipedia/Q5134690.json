His 1950 PhD on The Use of Quaternions in Wave-Tensor Calculus related to Arthur Eddington's work, and was supervised by cosmologist George C. McVittie, who was one of Eddington's students.  His own students included Brian Tupper (1959, King's College London, now professor emeritus of general relativity and cosmology at University of New Brunswick Fredericton [1]), Samuel Edgar (1977, University of London), and Tony Crilly (reader in mathematical sciences at Middlesex University).Kilmister was elected as a member of the London Mathematical Society during his doctoral studies (17 March 1949). Upon graduation, he began his career as an Assistant Lecturer in the Mathematics Department of King's College in 1950.  The entirety of his academic career was spent at King's.  In 1954, Kilmister founded the King's Gravitational Theory Group, in concert with Hermann Bondi and Felix Pirani, which focused on Einstein's theory of general relativity.  At retirement, Kilmister was both a Professor of Mathematics and Head of the King's College Mathematics Department.", "link_mentions": {}}}
