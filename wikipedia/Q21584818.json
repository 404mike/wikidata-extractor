Orient restored their two-goal advantage through Simpson in the second half, and Oliver scored a consolation goal with a header in the 86th minute. York were beaten 6\u20130 away by Portsmouth, in which Greening was sent off before half-time for catching Michael Doyle with his elbow, before Ben Davies and Marc McNulty gave the home team the lead early in the second half. McNulty scored two more goals before Ben Tollitt and Conor Chaplin finished the scoring for Portsmouth; this result saw York drop into the relegation zone for the first time in 2015\u201316. York signed five players before the deadline for loan transfers: defenders Mark Kitching from Middlesbrough and Stefan O'Connor from Arsenal, midfielders Jordan Lussey from Bolton Wanderers and Kenny McEvoy from Tottenham Hotspur, and striker Bradley Fewster from Middlesbrough. Winger Danny Galbraith, released by Gillingham at the end of last season, was signed before the deadline for free transfers. Collins, Morris, Turner and Tutonda were sent back to their parent clubs. York suffered another heavy defeat after losing 5\u20131 at home to Accrington, who were two goals up at half-time with goals from Matty Pearson and Billy Kee. Josh Windass scored a penalty for Accrington after O'Connor tripped Tom Davies, and Kee scored their fourth before Fewster scored for York with a shot into the bottom corner on 75 minutes. Shay McCartan finished the scoring for Accrington late into the match, and the result meant York equalled a club record of eight straight defeats.", "|Mark Kitching", "!scope=row|Mark Kitching * "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Middlesbrough F.C. season", "response": ["|26 November 2015||DF||||Mark Kitching||York City||One-month||"]}, {"page": "Mark Stephen Kitching", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Kitching"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Middlesbrough F.C. season", "response": ["| 27 January 2017 || DF ||  || Mark Kitching ||  Rochdale || 31 January 2017 || ", "| 31 January 2017 || DF ||  || Mark Kitching ||  Rochdale || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Rochdale A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 January 2017 || LB ||  || Mark Kitching || Middlesbrough || Undisclosed || ", "| 27 January 2017 || LB ||  || Mark Kitching || Middlesbrough || 31 January 2017 || "]}, {"page": "Danny Amos (footballer, born 1999)", "response": ["On 8 January 2019, Amos joined National League club Hartlepool United on loan until the end of the 2018\u201319 season.

It's a win-win for all parties.\" Money believed that Amos's arrival would allow him to move Mark Kitching up to midfield. Amos made his \"Pools\" debut four days later, in a 2\u20131 FA Trophy defeat to AFC Telford United at Victoria Park, after which Money said that \"I thought he was our best player\". Amos stated that the loan spell, which saw him feature mainly as a left wing-back in eight games, meant that \"I had to make my own way up to Hartlepool everyday, it was a big task for me which helped me mature and take on more responsibility\". Hartlepool manager Craig Hignett ruled out a move to sign Amos in the summer as he felt Doncaster were keen to keep hold of the young left-back."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Rochdale A.F.C. season", "response": ["|32||||LM||Mark Kitching                                     ||2||0||0||0||2", "|32||||CF||Mark Kitching                                           ||3||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||0||5||0||0"]}, {"page": "Kitching, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Kitching"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Rochdale A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2018 || LB ||  || Mark Kitching || Hartlepool United || Released || "]}]}}
