At Athens, the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions. As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers. The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright Aristophanes.Aristophanes: Clouds K.J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. page X. These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked fun at everyone and every institution. In The Birds, he ridicules Athenian democracy. In The Clouds, he attacks the philosopher Socrates. In Lysistrata, he denounces war.David Barrett's edition Aristophanes: the Frogs and Other Plays (Penguin Classics, 1964), p. 13 Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry. John Lempri\u00e8re's Bibliotheca Classica describes him as, quite simply, \"the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side Moli\u00e8re seems dull and Shakespeare clownish.\" Of all Aristophanes's plays, however, the one that has received the most lasting recognition is The Frogs, which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides. When it was performed for the first time at the Lenaia Festival in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize. It was the only Greek play that was ever given an encore performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia. Even today, The Frogs still appeals to modern audiences.
