The family was Nonconformist in religion and Liberal in politics.\nJohn Cheetham served as MP for South Lancashire and later Salford.\nDuring the Lancashire Cotton Famine in 1861\u201365, Cheetham rose to prominence as President of the Cotton Supply Association: a body that aimed to promote the growth and export of raw cotton outside the US and particularly in the British Raj. As the US cotton supply returned however, Cheetham's frequent attacks on the governance of the Raj gradually caused opinion in Britain and India to turn against the Association, and it dissolved in 1872.\nHis son John Frederick Cheetham was MP for North Derbyshire and later for Stalybridge.", "link_mentions": {}}}
