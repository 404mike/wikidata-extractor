As the US cotton supply returned however, Cheetham's frequent attacks on the governance of the Raj gradually caused opinion in Britain and India to turn against the Association, and it dissolved in 1872.\nHis son John Frederick Cheetham was MP for North Derbyshire and later for Stalybridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancashire Cotton Famine", "response": ["On Saturday 21 March, the magistrates released most of the prisoners but committed 28 for trial in Chester.

On the Sunday, supporters and visitors arrived in the town but there were no developments. On Monday 23 March the riot spread to Ashton, Hyde and Dukinfield. Schools had reopened but only 80 of the expected 1,700 students attended (agreed to be paid by ticket). Representatives were sent to the schools in the neighbouring towns to persuade the scholars to walk out but were met by soldiers. On the Tuesday the mobilisation ended, the relief committee offered to pay the outstanding tickets and to accept a delegation from the thirteen schools to discuss the matter further. The mayor offered that the MP, John Cheetham would take the matter to parliament.
