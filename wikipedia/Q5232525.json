He played first-class cricket from 1961 to 1968 for Kent County Cricket Club and Leicestershire County Cricket Club. He later became an international umpire, officiating in 36 Test matches from 1971 to 1988 and 33 one-day internationals from 1972 to 2001.\nConstant began his first-class cricket career with Kent in 1961 before moving to Leicestershire in 1965 and playing there until 1968. He was a middle-order batsman who made 67 first-class appearances. In total he scored 1,517 first-class runs at a batting average of 19.20 with a highest score of 80. Tony Lewis described his innings against Glamorgan on a difficult pitch at Leicester in 1965 as \"one of the bravest innings I ever saw\".His first Test as umpire was the Third Test between England and Pakistan in July 1971. He last stood in an international cricket match in the England v. Australia One Day International at The Oval, London in June 2001. He was the longest-serving umpire in county cricket, spending 38 years on the first-class umpires' list.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 9", "response": ["*1941 \u2013 David Constant, English cricketer and umpire"]}, {"page": "Bradford-on-Avon", "response": ["*David Constant, Test cricket umpire"]}, {"page": "Michael Holding", "response": ["According to an urban myth, during a Test match between the West Indies and England when Holding was to bowl to English player Peter Willey, the BBC radio commentator at the time, Brian Johnston, described the action as \"The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey\" (a double entendre, as \"willy\" is British English slang for a penis). However Wisden states that there is no record of Johnston or anyone else actually saying this (although a colleague of Johnston's, Henry Blofeld, has said he recalls the incident occurring during a Test match at The Oval in 1976.) In a limited-overs international between England and West Indies on 26 August 1976 at Scarborough, Michael Holding's return from long-leg deflected off the nearer wicket, breaking the bails, and then scuttled along the pitch to also break the far wicket, with Graham Barlow and Alan Knott, on his only appearance as England's captain, stranded in mid-pitch. This highly unusual occurrence of both wickets being broken by one throw dumbfounded the umpires, David Constant and Arthur Jepson, who rejected the run-out appeal for reasons that still remain obscure, given the undertones of the Test series and the nationality of the umpires (neutral umpires were not introduced until 1994) bias, racial or otherwise, might be considered. The West Indies played 26 first-class matches on the tour, winning 18 and losing only 2, making them the most successful side ever to tour England."]}, {"page": "Handled the ball", "response": ["In total, there were 63 occasions on which a batsman has been given out handled the ball in first-class cricket and 5 instances in List A cricket. Brodribb suggests that it is likely that there should have been a significant number more dismissals than there have been for handling the ball: in addition to the cases where batsman have returned the ball to the fielding side without permission, there are records of cases in which the umpires have been reticent to uphold an appeal. On one such instance, the umpire David Constant rejected an appeal against Younis Ahmed, saying that he thought the appeal was not serious."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Agnew", "response": ["Wisden describes how in the first innings, Agnew's accuracy was affected by debutant nerves, but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2\u201351. Agnew describes how Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets, catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips, and passing on some advice on how to dismiss Viv Richards, Botham's great friend: \"Botham said: 'Right. Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15.\"Agnew. Thanks, Johnners. p. 41 Wisden called the pair of batsmen Agnew's \"first illustrious victims in Test cricket\"."]}, {"page": "Dickie Bird", "response": ["Bird's attention to detail was placed under scrutiny at the Centenary Test between England and Australia at Lord's in 1980. Although the Saturday of this particular match had mostly pleasant sunshine, Bird and his fellow umpire, David Constant, refused to let play start because of the previous night's rain; parts of the outfield were still too waterlogged, according to the officials. Angry Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) members scuffled with Constant as he and the team captains returned to the Long Room after their fifth pitch inspection. The two captains, Ian Botham and Greg Chappell, had to intervene to protect Constant. Bird, however, was still on the pitch at the time according to his own recounting of the event in his book. When play finally started at 3:45\u00a0pm, police had to escort the umpires through the Long Room and on to the field. This was not the only occasion in which Bird had to stop play, despite current sunny conditions, because of previous bad weather: in the 1988 Test at Headingley against the West Indies, an overnight rainstorm caused a blocked drain to overflow with a delayed action: the pitch was fine but the bowler's run-up was slowly flooding from underneath, the water level was oozing up over Curtly Ambrose's bootlaces, and Bird's as well when he went over to investigate, and the umpires had to take the players off while the outfield was cleared of water."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|David Constant||||36||1971||1988"]}, {"page": "Alec Skelding", "response": ["Alec Skelding stood in 536 first-class games.  His first game as umpire began on 9 May 1931 at New Road when he oversaw, Worcestershire County Cricket Club v Northamptonshire County Cricket Club.

Of his contemporaries, only Frank Chester stood in more first-class games with 774, though David Constant has since eclipsed Skelding in second place.
