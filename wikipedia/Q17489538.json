His father after beginning in that profession, turned to private business and the establishment of factories in the textile trade.", "Conrady's teaching proved seminal, since he was able to take the arcane and rather disorganized discipline of optical design and establish it on a systematic, didactic basis, applying many of his newly devised procedures and theoretical insights, e.g., the doctrine of the optical path length (OPL) and optical path difference (OPD), which he had published during the period from 1904 to 1920. Many important optical designers of the 20th century\u2014most notably his son-in-law, Rudolf Kingslake, as well as his eldest daughter, Hilda Conrady Kingslake\u2014received his instruction and utilized his methods.", "Subsequently, Conrady planned and partially wrote a second volume. But the disruptions of life in London during World War II, along with his own ill health, prevented Conrady from finishing the work. He died in 1944 at the age of 78 in London.Kingslake & Kingslake, p. 178 His younger daughter, Irene, carefully preserved his manuscript and other unpublished papers until after the war. It finally fell to Hilda Conrady Kingslake and her husband Rudolf Kingslake to edit and complete the manuscript, which they published as Applied Optics and Optical Design, part two (Dover, 1960).Conrady & Kingslake, p. 832"]}, {"page": "Kingslake", "response": ["*Hilda Conrady Kingslake (1902\u20132003), English-American researcher in the field of optics"]}]}}
