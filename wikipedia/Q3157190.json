After Phil May walked out on the Pretty Things he carried on with Peter Tolson, Gordon Edwards and Skip Alan in Metropolis. He also was a member of Rainbow for three weeks in late 1978.He launched a solo career with the album Humanesque in 1980.

However, \"Teenage Dream\" from the 1974 album Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend Gloria Jones on keyboards as well as backing vocals."]}, {"page": "Pretty Things", "response": ["In 1974, Pretty Things were one of the first acts signed by Swan Song Records, the label created by Led Zeppelin, and Peter Grant became their manager.

Rex members Mickey Finn, Jack Green, and drummer Paul Fenton were invited by Mick Gray (a.k.a. Marmalade), former T.Rex tour manager, to The Marc Bolan Anniversary Concert to celebrate Marc's 50th birthday, taking place at the Cambridge Corn Exchange, where Gray was manager. Prior to this, Gray had taken former road manager Mick O'Halloran to visit Mickey Finn at his home (Gray and Finn had remained good friends through the years) to persuade him to attend the Cambridge bash. This idea was Gray's brainchild to celebrate Bolan's 50th birthday. Other artists appearing included John's Children and Rolan Bolan with T.Rextasy being the house band and paid \u00a31,500 for the privilege by the organiser. Drummer Bill Legend was invited to appear, but did not appear on the night due to ongoing personal problems. Finn, Fenton, and Green were overwhelmed with the support at that gig, so they decided to form Mickey Finn's T. Rex. The line-up was Finn (congas), Fenton (drums), Green (guitar and vocals), Dave Major (keyboards), and Tony Allday (bass guitar). One year later, Rob Benson, a lifelong fan of T. Rex, went to see the reformed band in Northampton's Chicago Rock cafe. He met the band afterward and was asked to send an audition tape after claiming to be able to sing like Marc Bolan. The band's manager Barry Newby decided that the voice was essential to the T. Rex sound and, after hearing Rob's tape, invited him to a further audition; soon he was asked to be lead vocalist. The band renamed themselves Mickey Finn's T-Rex, and acquired the legal trademark rights for the \"T-Rex\" bandname. In 1999, guitarist Jack Green (who had played in T.Rex in 1973-1974) left and was replaced by founding member of Smokie Alan Silson.", "*Jack Green \u2013 guitars, lead vocals (1997\u20131999)"]}, {"page": "List of RCA Records artists", "response": ["*Jack Green"]}]}}
