He played for twenty-three Colts of England against the MCC in 1881 and in that year made his debut for Derbyshire in a victory against Sussex setting his place as wicket keeper for the club.\nIn the 1882 season, he continued to keep wicket, although as a batsman he found himself getting out cheaply. Derbyshire played host to the touring Australians, and  Disney found himself out to the bowling of Eugene Palmer on two occasions. He played a full season in 1883 but in 1884 Disney took a year out of the side, when Thomas Mycroft filled the wicket-keeping slot. He returned in 1885, when he was once again a first-team pick. Disney remained a force as a wicket-keeper and    continued playing for Derbyshire until 1890, although the club lost first-class status in 1887.
