He cited also the opinion of Alfred Eberhard, whose edition of the Philogelos he was reviewing, in Latin: \"homo Graecus tot libris inventis, corruptis, ablatis, subditis celeber\" (He was a Greek who was famous for the number of books he discovered, destroyed, stole, and concealed). Eberhard used a joke manuscript compiled by Minas, but complained that it gave no provenance for the jokes."]}]}}
