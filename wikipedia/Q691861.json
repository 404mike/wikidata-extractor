Reg Revans was sceptical about the use of learning coaches and, in general, of interventionist approaches. He believed the action learning set or group could practice action learning on its own. He also had a major concern that too much process facilitation would lead a group to become dependent on a coach or facilitator. Nevertheless, later in his development of the action learning method, Revans experimented with including a role that he described as a \"supernumerary\" that had many similarities to that of a facilitator or coach (Revans, 2011, p.\u00a09). Revans, like many other action learning practitioners, noted that without someone dedicated to managing basic process norms as well as championing individual, team, and organizational learning, action learning often devolved into much action without much learning."]}, {"page": "Battersea Grammar School", "response": ["* Reg Revans, 1928 Olympic athlete and pioneer of Action Learning"]}, {"page": "Reginald Revans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reg Revans"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1930 British Empire Games", "response": ["South African Harry Hart was highly successful in the throwing events and he came away from the games as the champion in the shot put and discus throw, as well as being the javelin throw bronze medallist.
