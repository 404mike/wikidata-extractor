The show's mascot, a golden robot called \"Mr. Chips\", appears in many of the animations. In the revived version of the show, the same format remains, but there are three contestants and there is no particular attention paid to gender.", "From series 2, (the Roy Walker era) a new feature which was not seen in the US version, the \"Ready Money Round\", was introduced. This round followed a similar structure to a standard round, except that all catchphrases were worth a fixed amount of money (originally \u00a350) and there was no bell, so the contestants could buzz in and answer them whenever they wished and as many times until the puzzle is solved or time runs out. In the TVS series from 1986 to 1994, this round was played only after the second normal round, subsequent rounds being played as standard with the bell and money randomiser. In the Carlton series from 1994 to 1999, however, all of the rounds in part two (up until the end of round klaxon) were ready money rounds. The amount for a normal catchphrase in the first Ready Money round increased to \u00a3100 for series 11 and \u00a3125 for series 12\u201313. From series 11\u201313, each catchphrase would be worth \u00a3150 in the second Ready Money round.

If neither player guessed correctly, a normal catchphrase would determine who won the bonus bank money.", "In the Super Catchphrase, the winning contestant faced a 5 x 5 board of 25 squares, each marked with a letter from A to Y in ascending order. The contestant chose a square and attempted to solve a catchphrase behind it. During the Roy Walker era, the aim was to get five squares in 60 seconds.", "In homage to the show, a popular radio parody of Catchphrase, entitled Car Park Catchphrase was broadcast on The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 from January 2004 until December 2005. It returned to the airwaves on 8 January 2007. It was taken off the air again because of the phone-in competitions being suspended but later returned. The format in comparison to the TV show slightly changed and required callers to play from their cars and 'honk' their horns when they knew the catchphrase being described. Roy Walker himself records voice samples for the game.", "One of the most famous moments in the show's history included a ready money bonus catchphrase where the answer to the puzzle was \"Snake charmer\". However, the puzzle was uncovered in such a way which caused the audience, the contestants and host Roy Walker to laugh uncontrollably as the game went on as it appeared Mr. Chips and the snake were doing something sexual.
