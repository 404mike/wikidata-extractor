Coming eventually to Louisville, Kentucky, he came under the influence of Reverend W.W. Everts, who turned Lorimer to Christianity. Lorimer graduated from Georgetown College, Kentucky, in 1859. He was ordained in the Baptist Ministry, first holding brief pastorates in Harrodsburg, Kentucky and Paducah, Kentucky, and then for eight years at the Walnut Street Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky. After another brief term in Albany, New York, he next took up an office at the Tremont Temple in Boston, where he would serve as pastor for 21 years, with some interruptions. Noted educator Sophia B. Packard served for some time as his assistant.\nEarly in February 1879 the financially distressed First Baptist Church of Chicago extended a call to Lorimer to go there from the Tremont Temple, and on May 4, 1879, he preached his first sermon as pastor of the Chicago congregation. Lorimer's pastorate was \"successful in the highest degree\", and by January 1881, the church raised sufficient means to pay a substantial portion of its debt. On September 25, 1881. Lorimer delivered his farewell sermon in Chicago, returning to the Tremont Temple and leaving a gift of $1,600 to the reorganized Chicago congregation. In 1901 he took up a new pastorate for the last time, at the Madison Avenue Baptist Church in New York City. He died of pneumonia at Aix-les-Bains, and was interred in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In addition to his preaching duties, Lorimer was the author of \"many widely-read books on religious and social topics\".Lorimer was married to Belle Burford, with whom he had three daughters and a son, publisher George Horace Lorimer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Old University of Chicago", "response": ["|George C.

After a short-lived attempt to operate her own school in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, in partnership with her longtime companion, Harriet E. Giles, Packard taught at the Connecticut Literary Institution in Suffield (1859\u201364). From 1864 to 1867 she was co-principal of the Oread Collegiate Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. She then moved to Boston, where she secured in 1870 the unusual position of pastor's assistant under the Reverend George C. Lorimer of the Shawmut Avenue Baptist Church and later of the Tremont Temple. In 1877 she presided over the organizing meeting of the Woman's American Baptist Home Mission Society, of which she was chosen treasurer that year and corresponding secretary the next."]}, {"page": "George Horace Lorimer", "response": ["Lorimer was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of the Rev.

In the days before this, invitations had been extended to Scottish groups throughout North America, with many traveling to Albany to see the unveiling. The ceremony commenced with a parade at 3 p.m. of members of these various groups which ended at the site of the statue. At this point, a crowd of several thousand had gathered around the statue, which was draped with an American flag. Kinnear gave the opening address of the ceremony, where he spoke about the McPherson family. Following this, The Reverend Robert Collyer, orator for the ceremony, gave an address where he spoke about Burns and his legacy. During this speech, the flag covering the statue fell slightly, exposing Burns's head. This caused a slight disruption among the crowd, and the band played \"Ye Banks and Braes\" before Collyer continued his speech without further interruption. After Collyer, The Reverend George C. Lorimer of Albany's First Baptist Church gave a brief speech, which was followed by a rendition of \"There was a Lad was born in Kyle\" performed by Thomas Impett of Troy, New York. Following this, the statue was officially unveiled and Kinnear presented it to park officials. Abraham Lansing accepted the statue on behalf of park commissioners. Celebrations at the statue then ended with Impett's performance of \"Auld Lang Syne\"."]}]}}
