In 1844, she married Sir James Stansfeld (1820\u20131898), the future MP for Halifax and preeminent political advocate for the movement to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts. She maintained a close friendship with Italian nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini, who wrote to her frequently and 1,500 of his letters to the family have been published in E.F.

Other revolutionaries who frequent her mother and stepfather's house in St. John's Wood included Karl Marx and Louis Blanc. Her early commitment to women's suffrage was influenced by her mother's friend Caroline Ashurst Stansfeld, who was active in the British feminist movement from its origins in the 1840s. These radical affiliations are manifested in Blind's politically charged poetry, and in her own unbending commitment to reform. As Richard Garnett observed, in the society of political refugees and radicals Blind was raised in, \"admiration musts necessarily be reserved for audacity in enterprise, fortitude in adversity... anything breathing unconquerable defiance of the powers that were.\""]}, {"page": "William Johnson Fox", "response": ["In 1817 Fox moved to London, becoming minister of Parliament Court Chapel. In 1824 he moved the congregation to South Place Chapel, in Finsbury on the edge of the City of London, which had been built specifically for him. Around Fox and the chapel there gathered a group of progressive thinkers, including feminists and, through William Lovett, some adherents of Chartism. The circle included Sophia Dobson Collet, who saw some of Fox's sermons into print; Mary Leman Gillies, who wrote on women's rights; and Caroline Ashurst Stansfeld, whose marriage to James Stansfeld was conducted by Fox."]}, {"page": "Matilda Ashurst Biggs", "response": ["Matilda was the second of the four daughters of William Henry Ashurst and Elizabeth Ann Brown: her sisters were Eliza Ashurst Bardonneau-Narcy, Caroline Ashurst Stansfeld, and Emilie Ashurst Venturi.

She must, indeed, have possessed a rare intellect.\"  She had one brother, William Henry Ashurst, junior, who became solicitor to the Post Office.
