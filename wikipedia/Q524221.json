This species was described as Bufo regularis rangeri, in 1935, by John Hewitt of the Albany Museum, Grahamstown, from collections made by naturalist Gordon A. Ranger at his farm \"Gleniffer\" 3\u00a0km E of Kei Road, in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Among several other forms described from these collections was the eastern leopard toad, Sclerophrys pardalis, which Ranger distinguished from the raucous toad on behaviour and calls (according to his nephew, Mr Gary Ranger, \"Gleniffer\" was subdivided in the late 1930s and the portions renamed, including \"Hillside\" and \"Rockdale\", where there is a monument to the older Mr Ranger). Hewitt considered the raucous toad, along with most other large toads of Southern Africa, as subspecies of the widespread African toad Bufo regularis (a species which is now considered absent from Southern Africa, predominantly occurring in subsaharan Africa north of the equator). In 1964, Poynton raised Bufo rangeri of Hewitt, 1935 to full species status, distinguishing it from co-occurring related forms. More recently, Frost and co-authors (2006) assigned this species to the new genus Amietophrynus, as part of a global revision of amphibian taxonomy based largely on DNA sequence data."]}, {"page": "Cape mountain toad", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Tradouw's mountain toad", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Hyperolius semidiscus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Climbing mantella", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Spinomantis aglavei", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Gephyromantis luteus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Gephyromantis malagasius", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Breviceps fuscus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Bainskloof moss frog", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}, {"page": "Arthroleptella", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist)"]}]}}
