Sutcliffe left the band to pursue his career as a painter, having previously attended the Liverpool College of Art. Sutcliffe and John Lennon are credited with inventing the name \"Beetles\" (sic), as they both liked Buddy Holly's band, the Crickets. They also had a fascination of group names with double meanings (as Crickets, for example, the word refers to both an insect as well as a sport), so John then came up with \"The Beatles\", from the word beat (though John's original spelling was \"Beatals\"). As a member of the group when it was a five-piece band, Sutcliffe is one of several people sometimes referred to as the \"Fifth Beatle\".\nWhen he performed with the Beatles in Hamburg, he met photographer Astrid Kirchherr, to whom he was later engaged. After leaving the Beatles, he enrolled in the Hamburg College of Art, studying under future pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi, who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his best students. Sutcliffe earned other praise for his paintings, which mostly explored a style related to abstract expressionism.\nWhile studying in Germany, Sutcliffe began suffering from intense headaches and experiencing acute light sensitivity. In February 1962, he collapsed in the middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed tests, but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. After collapsing again on 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way there. The cause of death was later found to have been a brain haemorrhage \u2013 severe bleeding in the right ventricle of his brain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Quarrymen", "response": ["The group made an amateur recording in 1958, performing Buddy Holly's \"That'll Be the Day\" and \"In Spite of All the Danger\", a song written by McCartney and Harrison. The group moved towards rock and roll, causing several of the original members to leave. This left Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, who performed under several other names, including Johnny and the Moondogs and Japage 3 before returning to the Quarrymen name in 1959. In 1960, the group changed their name to \"The Beatles\" (chosen for its double meaning). The name was conceived of late at night by Lennon and Stuart Sutcliffe, by then the group's fourth member, and introduced to the other two the next day. They were initially booked as \"The Silver Beetles\" by local clubs who saw it as a more sellable name than \"The Beatles\" and went on to be the best-selling music act of all time.", "The group continued their Casbah residency into the new year, occasionally securing other gigs. In January, Brown grew ill and was unable to play the show. Best, however, insisted that the Quarrymen still pay Brown, but Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison refused; the incident resulted in the loss of their residency at the Casbah and Brown's departure from the group. Shortly after, however, Lennon convinced fellow art school student Stuart Sutcliffe to purchase a bass guitar and join the group. The group had no bookings, but began rehearsing vigorously to allow the musical novice Sutcliffe practice on his new instrument.", "* Stuart Sutcliffe\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar (1960; died 1962)", "  bar:Stu    text:\"Stuart Sutcliffe \u2020\""]}, {"page": "1960 in music", "response": ["*January \u2013 Stuart Sutcliffe joins the Liverpool band Johnny and the Moondogs and suggests they change their name to the Beatals; after several variations this settles on The Beatles in August.", "*May 20\u201328 \u2013 The Beatles, as the Silver Beetles (uncredited), play their first ever tour, as a backing group for Johnny Gentle on a tour of Scotland.
