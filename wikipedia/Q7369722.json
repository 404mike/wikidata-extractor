They became only the 9th non-League side to reach the 5th round since 1945. They hosted Arsenal in the last 16 of the competition on 20 February where they lost 0\u20132. The game sparked a betting controversy surrounding the actions of Sutton's reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw, who ate a 'pastry' on the bench after Sun Bets offered odds of 8\u20131 against him eating a pie during the match. Shaw offered his resignation over the incident and Sutton were forced to play defender Simon Downer in goal in their next league game, against Torquay United, when first-choice goalkeeper Ross Worner was injured in the 15th minute. Sutton won the match 3\u20132."]}, {"page": "Neal Ardley", "response": ["As the season began, Ardley put faith in his summer signings with James Shea replacing last season's number one Ross Worner. AFC Wimbledon began the season brightly with a draw at home to Shrewsbury Town which was succeeded by fine wins over Luton Town and Southend United both of which came away from home. The club's first defeat in the league came after his side squandered a 1\u20130 lead at home to Hartlepool United to lose 2\u20131."]}, {"page": "Dean Holdsworth", "response": ["He assembled a number of free signings to replenish his squad: strikers Bradley Bubb and Michael Rankine; midfielders Anthony Pulis and Graeme Montgomery; defenders Aaron Brown and Jamie Collins; and goalkeeper Ross Worner. He also brought in a total of eight loanees in the first half of the season: Jake Taylor, Jordan Brown, Bruno Andrade, Adam Smith, Scott Davies, Jamie Day, Greg Pearson and Charlie Henry. His team proved to be inconsistent, though they did reach the Fourth Round of the League Cup, where they were beaten 3\u20130 by a Manchester United side that included Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Owen, and Antonio Valencia. In the January transfer window he released Graeme Montgomery and Anthony Pulis, whilst making four new loan signings in defenders Troy Brown and Sonny Bradley, midfielder Josh Payne, and striker Charlie Collins. He also recruited defender Chris Doig, and attempted to bolster his side's poor goalscoring record by paying a five figure fee for Cameroonian striker Guy Madjo. He also signed Stefan Payne, Wilko Risser and Josh Payne, as well as loanees Ben Smith, Darren Murphy, Michael Doughty, and Rob Sinclair. To make room for these signings he offloaded Jermaine McGlashan, Jamie Collins, Luke Guttridge, Chris Doig and Aaron Brown.

With the arrival of new goalkeeper Ross Worner in the 2011\u201312 season, Young was demoted to second choice goalkeeper but still managed to make a number of appearances in the later stage of the season when Worner was ruled out with a back injury.
