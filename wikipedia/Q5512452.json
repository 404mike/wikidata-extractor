He wrote Synopsis of Pure Mathematics (1886). This book, first published in England in 1880, was read and studied closely by mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan when he was a teenager. Ramanujan had already produced many theorems by the age of 15.\nCarr was a private coach for the Tripos mathematics examinations at the University of Cambridge, and the Synopsis was written as a study guide for those examinations.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Srinivasa Ramanujan", "response": ["In 1903, when he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, G. S. Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems.McElroy, Tucker (2005). A to Z of mathematicians. Facts on File. p. 221.  Ramanujan reportedly studied the contents of the book in detail. The book is generally acknowledged as a key element in awakening his genius. The next year Ramanujan independently developed and investigated the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal places. His peers at the time said they \"rarely understood him\" and \"stood in respectful awe\" of him.", "This may have been for any number of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan did most of his work and perhaps his proofs on slate, after which he transferred the final results to paper. At the time, slates were commonly used by mathematics students in the Madras Presidency. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of G. S. Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. It is also possible that Ramanujan considered his work to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results."]}, {"page": "University College School", "response": ["*G. S.
