Many report having seen him on stage with the group during this period, strumming on one chord through an entire concert or not playing at all. In August 1967, Pink Floyd were forced to cancel their appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Band manager Peter Jenner and bassist Roger Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist (an appointment he failed to attend), while a stay on the Spanish island of Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement in Barrett's behaviour. A few dates in September were followed by the band's first tour of the United States. At this point, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of \"Interstellar Overdrive\", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar; the audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation.

In May, Jenner led Barrett into the then-named EMI Studios, on Abbey Road in northwest London, to record some solo material, only part of which would later appear on The Madcap Laughs. Jenner thought Barrett would like to finish the tracks that Jenner transferred the previous October; Barrett on the other hand, had other plans. During these first, tentative sessions, Jenner failed to properly record any vocals at all for the tracks \"Golden Hair\", \"Late Night\", \"Clowns and Jugglers\" (later retitled \"Octopus\"), \"Silas Lang\", or \"Lanky (Parts One and Two)\". After recording had resumed in June and July, progress continued on these tracks, especially \"Swan Lee\", and a new, improved version of \"Clowns and Jugglers\" was taped at this point also.

In April 1969, the young executive took over the project and Barrett began working on newer material, while reworking the 1968 recordings. Jones would later explain the rationale behind EMI letting Barrett record again: \"What was decided was to see what was the strength of Syd's new material, and plan accordingly. If it worked, then, O.K. we'd do an album. If not, we'd call it a day\u00a0...\" In a meeting at Barrett's flat in Earls Court, unsure of Jenner's production technique, Jones asked to hear some of the previous year's tapes; Barrett played him \"Swan Lee\", \"Late Night\", \"Rhamadam\", \"Lanky (Parts One and Two)\" and \"Golden Hair\". Of these, \"Swan Lee\" had no vocals, but Jones saw potential in the song; \"Late Night\" did have vocals and, Jones remarked, \"a certain charm\"; while \"Golden Hair\" was \"great\".
