The film was lauded by the critics, and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture.

Many famous stars appeared in at least two or more Ford films, including Harry Carey Sr., (the star of 25 Ford silent films), Will Rogers, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara, James Stewart, Woody Strode, Richard Widmark, Victor McLaglen, Vera Miles and Jeffrey Hunter. Many of his supporting actors appeared in multiple Ford films, often over a period of several decades, including Ben Johnson, Chill Wills, Andy Devine, Ward Bond, Grant Withers, Mae Marsh, Anna Lee, Harry Carey Jr., Ken Curtis, Frank Baker, Dolores del R\u00edo, Pedro Armend\u00e1riz, Hank Worden, John Qualen, Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields, John Carradine, O. Z. Whitehead and Carleton Young. Core members of this extended 'troupe', including Ward Bond, John Carradine, Harry Carey Jr., Mae Marsh, Frank Baker, and Ben Johnson, were informally known as the John Ford Stock Company.", "The Last Hurrah, (Columbia, 1958), again set in present-day of the 1950s, starred Spencer Tracy, who had made his first film appearance in Ford's Up The River in 1930. Tracy plays an aging politician fighting his last campaign, with Jeffrey Hunter as his nephew. Katharine Hepburn reportedly facilitated a rapprochement between the two men, ending a long-running feud, and she convinced Tracy to take the lead role, which had originally been offered to Orson Welles (but was turned down by Welles' agent without his knowledge, much to his chagrin). It did considerably better business than either of Ford's two preceding films, grossing $950,000 in its first yearGallagher, 1986, p. 500 although cast member Anna Lee stated that Ford was \"disappointed with the picture\" and that Columbia had not permitted him to supervise the editing.", "Two Rode Together (Ford Productions-Columbia, 1961) co-starred James Stewart and Richard Widmark, with Shirley Jones and Stock Company regulars Andy Devine, Henry Brandon, Harry Carey Jr, Anna Lee, Woody Strode, Mae Marsh and Frank Baker, with an early screen appearance by Linda Cristal, who went on to star in the Western TV series The High Chaparral. It was a fair commercial success, grossing $1.6m in its first year.", "Ford's last completed feature film was 7 Women (MGM, 1966), a drama set in about 1935, about missionary women in China trying to protect themselves from the advances of a barbaric Mongolian warlord. Anne Bancroft took over the lead role from Patricia Neal, who suffered a near-fatal stroke two days into shooting. The supporting cast included Margaret Leighton, Flora Robson, Sue Lyon, Mildred Dunnock, Anna Lee, Eddie Albert, Mike Mazurki and Woody Strode, with music by Elmer Bernstein. Unfortunately, it was a commercial flop, grossing only about half of its $2.3\u00a0million budget. Unusual for Ford, it was shot in continuity for the sake of the performances and he, therefore, exposed about four times as much film as he usually shot. Anna Lee recalled that Ford was \"absolutely charming\" to everyone and that the only major blow-up came when Flora Robson complained that the sign on her dressing room door did not include her title (\"Dame\") and as a result, Robson was \"absolutely shredded\" by Ford in front of the cast and crew."]}, {"page": "2004 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 14 || Anna Lee || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 91 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actress || "]}, {"page": "2004 in American television", "response": ["|Anna Lee"]}, {"page": "List of show business families", "response": ["No relation to musician, Tommy Lee, or to soap opera actress, Anna Lee.", "No relation to martial artist, Lee Hoi-Chuen, or to soap opera actress, Anna Lee.", "* Soap opera actress Anna Lee was the adopted daughter of Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle."]}, {"page": "Margaret Lockwood", "response": ["Gaumont British were making a film version of the novel Doctor Syn, starring George Arliss and Anna Lee with director Roy William Neill and producer Edward Black.
