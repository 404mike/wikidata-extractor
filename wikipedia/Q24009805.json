We're already, I think, in a cold civil war. We've got a chance now to turn this around.

She testified, \"Ambassador Sondland blurted out: 'Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff (Mick Mulvaney) for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start,'\" and that John Bolton ended the meeting abruptly and later told her, \"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\" In her public testimony, Hill later apologized for implying that Sondland's diplomatic activities were part of an irregular channel, saying, \"I wasn\u2019t really being fair to Ambassador Sondland because he was carrying out what he thought he had been instructed to carry out and we were doing something that we thought was just as, or perhaps even more important, but it wasn\u2019t in the same channel.\"", "In his public testimony on November 20, Sondland said it was at the \"express direction of the president\" that he, Kurt Volker, and Rick Perry, commonly referred to as \"the three amigos,\"  worked with Giuliani on Ukraine matters even though they were uncomfortable with Giuliani's role. He said that the leadership of the State Department and the National Security Council, including Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, were fully informed of their activities and Giuliani's, adding \"Everyone was in the loop.\" He said that Trump, through Giuliani, was clearly demanding a public commitment by Zelensky to investigate Burisma (a Ukrainian gas company where Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden had sat on the board) and the 2016 election as a prerequisite to receive a White House invitation or phone call. \"Was there a \u2018quid pro quo? The answer is yes,\" he said in his opening remarks. The quid pro quo in question was relating to the public commitment by Zelensky to investigate Burisma and the 2016 election as a prerequisite to receive a White House invitation or phone call. He said it was \"his personal guess\" that the aid to Ukraine was also being withheld to achieve that goal, but that he never heard Trump say so. Although he confirmed that he had conversed by phone with Trump on July 26 as previously reported by Taylor and Holmes, who both testified that during that call Trump had asked if Ukraine would investigate the Bidens, Sondland said that he \"had no reason to doubt\" that the subject had included investigations but he \"had no recollection\" of discussing the Bidens. Kurt Volker and Rick Perry also denied that the connection between Burisma investigation and the Bidens was mentioned. Sondland testified to Devin Nunes that he remains \"a proud member of the three amigos,\" and said that he would have objected to the Burisma investigation if he had connected it to the Bidens. In her testimony on the following day Fiona Hill was asked, \"Is it credible to you that Mr. Sondland was completely in the dark about this [connection] all summer?\" she replied, \"It is not credible to me that he was oblivious.\""]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the University of St Andrews", "response": ["| Dr. Fiona Hill (presidential advisor)"]}, {"page": "Matt Gaetz", "response": ["Gaetz is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, but not of the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, or Oversight and Reform Committees, and so was not allowed to join lawmakers' closed-door deposition of former White House Russia aide Fiona Hill in October 2019.

According to reports, Hill irritated the Scottish Conservatives in particular. They complained of her excessive \"interference\" and of being told not to run a campaign too detached from the one run from London. Nevertheless, their leader Ruth Davidson chose to ignore the demand, to achieve a considerable increase in the number of Scottish MPs.
