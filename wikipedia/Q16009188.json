Allatini, A.T. Fitzroy, Mrs Cyril Scott, Lucian Wainwright, and  Eunice Buckley. She is best known for her 1918 novel Despised and Rejected (written under the pen name A T Fitzroy), which was banned under the Defence of the Realm Act as it combines themes of pacifism and homosexuality which were thought \"likely to prejudice the recruiting of persons to serve on His Majesty's Forces\". Despised and Rejected was published by C. W. Daniel and was taken up by the Bloomsbury Group. The novel has been described by Angela K. Smith as drawing a connection between the persecution of homosexuals and the rhetoric of imperialism. It tells the story of a young woman's complex relationship with a  homosexual composer who is conscripted for military service; his refusal leads to trial and imprisonment.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Despised and Rejected", "response": ["#REDIRECT R.
