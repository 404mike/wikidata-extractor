(1967\u2013present)", "response": ["A host of names were linked with the Baseball Ground managerial spot \u2013 including Martin O'Neill, Steve Coppell, Ossie Ardiles and Neil Warnock. Steve Bruce rejected the chance to be player-manager before the club finally selected Jim Smith. out of a final two of Smith and Brian Horton. Smith, who appointed former Derby player Steve McClaren as his number two, joined a club with 15 out of contract players on high wages and players such as Craig Short, Mark Pembridge and Paul Williams intent on leaving. Smith sold them all, to Everton, Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City respectively, raising \u00a34.5m in the process. With promise that any money raised in player sales would be given to him for purchases, Smith began restructuring his squad with the signing of Robin Van Der Laan (\u00a3475,000 and Lee Mills) from Port Vale, Sean Flynn (a \u00a3250,000 makeweight in the Paul Williams deal), Gary Rowett (another makeweight, this time in exchange for Craig Short), Darryl Powell for \u00a3750,000 from Portsmouth and Ron Willems for \u00a3280,000 from Swiss champions Grasshopper Z\u00fcrich. Smith's eye for capturing players such as Rowett and Flynn in part exchange deals, as well as the fact that most of Cox's big money buys had held a large percentage of their value, meant that his transfer dealings did not hit the red until the signing of Ashley Ward for \u00a31m from Norwich City in March 1996. Employing his new signings alongside incumbent players such as Dean Sturridge and Russell Hoult, as well as McFarland's last major signing, Notts County defender Dean Yates (who was Player of the Season), Smith started the 1995\u201396 season poorly, with just 4 wins from their opening 14 games, but the influential signing of Igor Stimac for \u00a31.57m from Hajduk Split proved the key. Although Stimac's debut ended in a heavy defeat, 5\u20131 to Tranmere Rovers with Stimac scoring, Smith's jigsaw was complete and Derby's season turned on its head. The club embarked on a 20 match unbeaten league run from 11 November 1995 to 5 March 1996, the club's best run inside of one season. In this sequence the club won 13 of its fixtures, scoring three or more goals on 8 occasions and recorded a 4\u20131 win at Birmingham City, their first win at St. Andrews since 1948, and catapulted themselves from the bottom five to the top of the table in the space of four months, at one point finding themselves 7 points clear at the top of the table. The run ended with a 0\u20133 defeat by title rivals Sunderland at Roker Park but the club recovered to take 12 points from their next 8 fixtures, including revenge on Tranmere with a 6\u20132 win at The Baseball Ground. They went into the last home game of the season against 3rd placed Crystal Palace knowing victory would guarantee promotion. After a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Leicester City on 10 September 1995, Derby had been unbeaten in the league at home, winning 13 \u2013 including 8 consecutively \u2013 and drawing 6, and Dean Sturridge, who finished the season as the club's top scorer with 20 goals, and Robin Van Der Laan ensured the club won 2\u20131 to secure 2nd place and a return to the top flight, and a first season in the Premier League, after a five-year absence. Smith became the first man to earn promotion at the first attempt in the club's history and had managed it with very little outlay, using his knowledge and experience to shape an attacking outfit which played football the right way."]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sean Flynn"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|Sean Flynn"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Football League First Division", "response": ["| West Bromwich Albion ||  Denis Smith ||  Sean Flynn || Patrick || West Bromwich Building Society"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["|Sean Flynn"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["|Sean Flynn"]}]}}
