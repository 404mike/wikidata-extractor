Tom Pope began the season with a six match ban after a Twitter post he made in January was judged to have amounted to Antisemitic canard. Askey meanwhile continued to strengthen the squad, bringing in midfielder Danny Whitehead, who had also played under Askey at Macclesfield Town and had just been released from Salford City. The club kit was revealed later that week, the unique \u201cV\u201d patterned home strip having partly designed by Robbie Williams, club owner Carol Shanahan and her son Patrick. Askey looked at a number of players on trial during pre-season, including free agents Dino Visser, Harvey Bradbury, Rhys Lovett, Ethan Beckford and David Fitzpatrick, as well as Nottingham Forest academy player Kieran Hayes. However the next signing, a fourth and final striker, was Theo Robinson, who had played for the club in 2016. He also signed trialist left-back David Fitzpatrick, another of his former charges at Macclesfield, on a one-year deal. He completed the squad with goalkeeper Dino Visser, who \"did everything asked of him\" in his trial. However winger Rhys Browne left the club by mutual consent, citing family reasons; Askey said that \"it was a shame because he was doing well\".

He also transfer-listed Theo Robinson, Danny Whitehead and Scott Burgess. Clarke's first signing as manager was Brad Walker, a defensive ball playing central midfielder who had been released from League One club Shrewsbury Town. He then paid Blackpool an undisclosed fee for central midfielder Ben Garrity, who he described as \"young, hungry and ambitious\". Biddulph-born James Wilson was then signed upon his release from Salford City, a 25-year old striker who had come through Manchester United as a highly rated teenager. The club also confirmed that Andy Crosby would be staying on at the club as assistant manager, which director of football David Flitcroft said was \"a really important signing\" due to his \"outstanding coaching, organisational skills, knowledge, work ethic and enthusiasm\". Aaron Martin, a 31-year old centre-back who had previously worked with Crosby at Southampton, then joined on a two-year deal. Another former Salford City player, left-back Dan Jones, then joined on a two-year deal.
