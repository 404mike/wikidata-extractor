Loran Dunn of Delaval is the producer, with Williams and Roberts joining the production as executive producers. Filming began in 2020 at Aardman Studios, and is set to complete in September 2021. Salvation Has No Name is a cinematic folktale that explores the issue of xenophobia and faith around the refugee crisis through a surreal performance of a troupe of circus clowns who gather to perform a story about a disillusioned priest falling in love with a refugee, but as their misguided tale unfolds, the border between fiction and reality begin to fray. The film features an all-female international voice cast, that includes Itziar Itu\u00f1o, Yasmine Al Massri, Anna Savva, Barbara Sotelsek, Katrina Kleve, and Elisabetta Spaggiari.
