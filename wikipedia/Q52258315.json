He is the Kenneth F. Burgess Professor at Northwestern University and since 1991, and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. From 1990 to 2016, he was the John Evans Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Northwestern University.Lamb's research has been focused on influenza and paramyxoviruses. His work on mechanism of action of viral proteins has had a significant impact on the field of virology. His research in this area has led to the development of new vaccines and medicines. Lamb has also done considerable research on how cells work.For his contributions to the field of virology, Lamb has won several awards. In 1990, he was awarded the Wallace P. Rowe Award for Excellence in Virology Research. In 2003, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and in 2010, the University of Birmingham awarded him an Sc.D. honaris causa. He also won consecutive MERIT awards from the National Institutes of Health 1987-2006 and 2007-2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lamb (surname)", "response": [":* Robert A.
