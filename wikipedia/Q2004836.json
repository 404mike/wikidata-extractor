Middleton was one of the best and most popular riders in the United Kingdom. When the Empress of Austria hunted in Ireland, he was her pilot. He repeatedly rode the winners over the stiffest steeplechase courses, including the Punchestown (Ireland) Grand National. Besides being distinguished as a horseman, he was a good cricketer, belonging to the Jockey Cricket Club.\nHis nickname \"Bay\" was either a reference to his reddish-brown hair, or derived from the name of the winner of The Derby winner in 1836.", "link_mentions": {}}}
