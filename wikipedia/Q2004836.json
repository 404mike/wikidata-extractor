He joined the Lord Lieutenant's staff as an extra Aide de Camp in 1870, where he was based at the Viceregal Lodge in Dublin, was promoted to captain and left services. Middleton was one of the best and most popular riders in the United Kingdom. When the Empress of Austria hunted in Ireland, he was her pilot. He repeatedly rode the winners over the stiffest steeplechase courses, including the Punchestown (Ireland) Grand National. Besides being distinguished as a horseman, he was a good cricketer, belonging to the Jockey Cricket Club.\nHis nickname \"Bay\" was either a reference to his reddish-brown hair, or derived from the name of the winner of The Derby winner in 1836.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Middleton", "response": ["George Middleton may refer to:", "* George Middleton (activist) (1735\u20131815), African-American Revolutionary War veteran, activist, and Freemason", "* George Middleton (American politician) (1800\u20131888), New Jersey congressman", "* Sir George Middleton (British politician) (1876\u20131938), Labour Member of Parliament for Carlisle 1922\u20131924, 1929\u20131931", "* George Middleton (playwright) (1880\u20131967), American playwright, director, and producer", "* George Middleton (trade unionist) (1898\u20131971), General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress", "* Sir George Middleton (diplomat) (1910\u20131998), British diplomat"]}, {"page": "William Middleton", "response": ["* George \"Bay\" Middleton (William George Middleton, 1846\u20131892), equerry to John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer"]}]}}
