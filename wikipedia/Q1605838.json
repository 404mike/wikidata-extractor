On August 15, 1873, Thompson's younger brother, Billy, shot and killed Sheriff Chauncey Whitney.  Whitney was standing near the two Thompson brothers, who were facing off against a local police officer, John \"Happy Jack\" Morco, and a gambler, John Sterling.

Morco and Hogue soon ran another Thompson friend, Neil Cain, out of town.  The town council dismissed Morco, Hogue, and Crawford, for inappropriate behavior.  Soon after, newly appointed police officer, J.C. \"Charlie\" Brown, killed Morco when he pulled a gun during a disturbance.  Friends of Cad Pierce soon killed Crawford.  Ed Hogue left town.

The three remaining brothers spread word around town that they intended to retaliate against Higgins, as well as his brother-in-law Bob Mitchell and friend Bill Wren. On March 26, 1877, Tom and Mart Horrell were ambushed outside of Lampasas; both were wounded but survived. Higgins was implicated, but it was never proven.

The two immediately set themselves up as \"house gamblers\", which was their main sort of employment. By this time, Sheriff Kingsbury had moved on, and Chauncey Whitney had taken over as County Sheriff. Whitney had a personality that made him an easy man to respect, as he was strong but fair. Whitney and the Thompson brothers became fast friends, and often spent time in one another's company, as both the brothers, Billy Thompson in particular, liked him. On August 15, 1873, Ben Thompson attempted to collect a debt owed to him by gambler John Sterling. When he confronted Sterling, the latter was in the company of John Morco. Knowing that Thompson was not armed, Sterling slapped him, followed by Morco pulling his pistol and forcing Thompson into the street.", "Thompson went and armed himself, and was quickly joined by his brother Billy, who was drunk. As the two brothers went to meet Morco and Sterling, who were calling for them to come and face them, Sheriff Whitney interceded, convincing the Thompson brothers to go have a drink and talk it over. Walking together, the three saw Morco and Sterling walking toward them, at which Ben Thompson fired a rifle shot in their direction. Morco and Sterling continued to advance, when suddenly Billy Thompson's shotgun discharged, accidentally shooting Sheriff Whitney. By all accounts, including that of Sheriff Whitney before his death on August 18, the shooting was an accident. Billy Thompson was forced by his brother to flee to avoid being lynched, probably a good decision at the time. He was later arrested and returned for trial, and acquitted.", "However, reaction to the death of Sheriff Whitney was swift and violent. A vigilante group was formed, taking action against any Texas cowboys causing trouble in town. On August 16, 1873, the day after the shooting, police officer Ed Crawford had shot Billy Thompson's friend Cad Pierce in the side, an incident that Officer Crawford provoked, then pistol whipped him to death, while in the same period Morco filed charges of assault against Ben Thompson. On August 17, 1873, Morco and Ed Hogue ran Neil Cain, another friend to the Thompson's, out of town. Crawford and Morco, however, avoided Ben Thompson during this time. Ed Hogue eventually arrested Ben Thompson on the assault charge."]}, {"page": "Mart Duggan", "response": ["With the town totally out of control, the council fired Pat Kelly, and sent for Mart Duggan once again.

Harlan, as well as well known gunman Billy Thompson, brother to gunfighter Ben Thompson. By April, 1880, Leadville was again under control and Duggan again refused reappointment.
