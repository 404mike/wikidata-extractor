In arguably his most successful period in management, Murphy secured Lincoln's promotion to Division Three in the 1980\u201381 season with a second-place finish behind Southend United, thanks in large measure to Gordon Hobson's 21 goals. The following season was almost as successful, with the Imps knocking out First Division side Leicester City in the League Cup, eventually losing to Spurs, and leading the Division Three table for four months. A loss of form, possibly in part caused by a fierce boardroom row over transfer budgets, resulted in Lincoln throwing away their advantage and finishing in a disappointing sixth place."]}]}}
