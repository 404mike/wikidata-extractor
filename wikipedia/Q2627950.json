He reworked its flagship Dan Dare strip. \nHe also drew Thunderbirds in a dramatic two-page format for the weekly comic TV Century 21. He drew the newspaper strip Garth for the Daily Mirror. His work was innovative in its graphic effects and sophisticated use of colour, and in the dynamic manner in which it broke out of the then-traditional grid system.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Palin", "response": ["*Bert Fegg's Nasty Book for Boys and Girls w/Terry Jones, illus Martin Honeysett, Frank Bellamy et al.

Dan Dare has been described as \"Biggles in Space\" and as the British equivalent of Buck Rogers. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated comic-strip artwork by Hampson and other artists, including Harold Johns, Don Harley, Bruce Cornwell, Greta Tomlinson, Frank Bellamy, Keith Watson and David Pugh.", "The quality of the strip and its popularity remained high throughout the 1950s. In the late fifties Eagle's new owners objected to the cost of the studio and the complexity of the stories. The conflict caused Hampson to leave the strip in 1959, in the middle of a long plot that saw Dan searching an alien planet for his long-lost father. Production fell to Frank Bellamy, whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with Hampson's, despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between Bellamy and the team of Don Harley and Keith Watson, and freelance artist Bruce Cornwell, who had been part of Hampson's studio at the beginning.", "In 1960 artwork was taken over by Frank Bellamy, Don Harley, Keith Watson, Gerald Palmer, with Bruce Cornwell, and the look changed, with the colourful, rounded rocket ships replaced by angular silver craft, and changes to the space suits and insignia. The changes were never wholeheartedly taken up, however, and the look was erratic from then on. In 1962 the strip was removed from the front to the inside of the comic, in black and white, and was drawn by Keith Watson. Over the remaining years the strip varied in format and quality, eventually returning to the front page in colour, until it ended in 1967 with Dan retiring to become Space Fleet controller. Strips from the 1950s were reprinted until 1969, when Eagle merged with Lion.

In 1955 he sold the copyright of his signature to Hulton for \u00a37,250 (a portion of which was a loan).  45% of his \u00a35,000 per annum salary was paid to the taxman.  With only one other profit-making magazine (Farmers Weekly), Hulton sought to curb Eagles costs, complaining about the use of taxis, expensive stationery, electricity and telephone bills, restaurant bills, and staff expenses.  At their 1957 AGM Hulton's Chairman reported a fall in profits, from \u00a3298,000 to \u00a336,000, blaming reduced revenue from another of their magazines, Picture Post, and increased production costs.  Several of Morris's friends later left the company, and following a short period of internal turmoil Morris gave up the editor's chair in 1959.  The following year Eagle was taken over by Odhams Press.  Hampson's studio (by then in Epsom) was disbanded, and following creative differences he retired from the comic.  His duties on Dan Dare were taken up by Frank Bellamy, described by Morris as \"a most fastidious artist and scrupulous draftsman, and like Hampson at his best, often consumed with anxiety.\"  With Keith Watson and Don Harley, the three worked from a studio in Fleet Street.  The front cover was redesigned, the Eagle name appearing across the top of the page rather than in one corner, coinciding with a new-look Dare.  Many readers found Bellamy's changes to Dare (made at the behest of Eagles publisher) objectionable.  Bellamy was succeeded by Harley, who in 1962 was followed by Watson, who had returned from a short stint working on Eagles rival, Lion.  Watson stopped drawing Dan Dare in 1967, and was succeeded by Bruce Cornwell. Following Hampson's departure, the emphasis on Dan Dare's exploration of the Solar System had changed instead to include interstellar travel.  Continuity became strained, and production on Dan Dare ceased in 1967, when it was replaced by reprints from earlier editions."]}, {"page": "Dez Skinn", "response": ["In 1971 Skinn and Bram Stokes produced Comicon '71 (the British Comic Art Convention) at the Waverley Hotel in London; the guest of honor was Frank Bellamy and other guests include Frank Dickens, Mick Farren, and Edward Barker.
