He turned professional in 1969, joining newly promoted Second Division side Watford. Although largely a reserve during his first two seasons at the club, he played a part in Watford's run to the semi-finals of the 1969\u201370 FA Cup, and played in the third place play-off match.Franks established himself as a regular in the Watford first team in the 1971\u201372 season with 44 appearances, but his team were unable to stave off relegation to the Third Division.

The Blades winning 5\u20130 in their second match of a three-match New Zealand tour. The South Islanders in Otago from the previous match had told the Blades manager, \"Taranaki would probably be one of the easiest games of the tour.\" On arrival to New Plymouth Sheffield United were met with a throng of media, \"The Blades Will Be Sharp\" was one headline in the many from the papers when Sheffield United prepared the day before the match. The South Yorkshire team included six-cap England international Tony Currie who \"nonchalantly\" told a New Plymouth Daily News reporter of his estimated \u00a3400,000 worth to the club and wage of around \u00a310,000/year after signing in 1968 for \u00a326,000, with the paper calling him Sheffield United's 'Golden Boy' in its headline.The Daily News \u2013 Taranaki, 30 May 1975, page 10 \"Our players earn between \u00a35000 to \u00a36000 a year with bonuses on top of that...\" Currie told the paper, \"I'm hitting top form and will be doing everything to get back into the England side for the 1978 World Cup.\" Disruptions and riots by fans were a big worry to all English soccer players, The Daily News quizzed with Currie commenting, \"It gets a bit nerve-racking especially when you play away games. Several times we have had our bus pelted by bricks by rival fans,..\" Sheffield United manager Mr. Ken Furphy would later slate the Rugby Park ground saying he had offered to mow the grass himself, it being knee-deep, \"We found it difficult to run between the tractor marks and the grass was too long, we play touch football but we could not play it on that field. It might be all right for the All Blacks...\" he told the Taranaki Herald on 3 June. Despite the uneven surface, Sheffield scored five \"sparkling\" goals, three of them from outside the penalty area. \"They never looked in the slightest of danger of being beaten and managed to string together some moves which showed signs of its acknowledged mastery,\" The Herald said of the Blades after the match. \"Captain Peter McCartney, David Allman and Ray Powell performed to capacity, tackling tenaciously and running back to cover fast, Taranaki's goal-keeper Martin was in fine form and surprisingly the best defender was Lex Casperson, normally a striker, who showed that even professionals have a difficult time when tightly marked, also coming up field on two occasions,\" continued the match report. \"If there was one fault in Taranaki's play it was that the Sheffield players were allowed too much reign just outside the penalty area, Peter Ritchie was the best of the Taranaki midfielders, distributing the ball well and looking for space. Hank Van Heckeren looked sharp until an unnecessarily late and aggressive tackle felled him only after 15 minutes.\" The player that was reported to have impressed Mr. Furphy the most was Wayne Huntley, the Taranaki forward stretching the Blades defence on several times with clever running. For Sheffield, Keith Eddy had the best game and his two goals were \"as fine as you hope to see.\" The Dominion reported the match with Furphy calling it a farce and recorded as saying, \"It's incredible really, here I was with over a million pounds worth of talent and I was being asked to put my players out in those conditions.\" The Taranaki invitation squad consisted of goal-keeper Wayne Martin, Ray Powell, Peter McCartney, David Allman, Robin Grey, Keith Capewell, Peter Ritchie, Hank Van Heckeren, Mike Johnston, Wayne Huntly, Rod Grant. Reserves; Phil Gerrard, Roger White, Lex Casperson, Robbie Paul, Mike Eakins, Barry Wilkinson, Brian Grieg and Alf Morley. Sheffield United put out a strong side in; Tom McAlister, Colin Franks, Terry Garbett, Keith Eddy, Steve Faulkner, Mick Speight, Alan Woodward, Keith Furphy, Chris Guthrie, Tony Currie, Tony Field, and David Bradford. Ken Furphy and Len Badger came on as substitutes. The scorers were; 15' Woodward, 35' Garbett, 75' Currie, 81' and 87' Eddy. An opportunity was missed by New Zealand football said Mr. Furphy on departure from the country, reported as being \"disappointed that no effort had been made to match the team with Glasgow Rangers while the two clubs were in the country.\""]}]}}
