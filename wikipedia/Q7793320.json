Pycroft worked for the New Zealand Railways Department and became a senior manager, but he retired young after receiving a large inheritance. This gave him more time for his real passion as a naturalist and ornithologist. He organised expeditions, mostly to islands off the coast of the North Island, with a focus on birds and plants. He grew rare plants at his large property in the Auckland suburb of Saint Heliers. Another of his interests was collecting rare books. When his library was put up for sale 40 years after his death, it was dubbed the \"last great private library\" in New Zealand. Pycroft held membership with the Auckland Institute at Auckland Museum for 75 years and was the organisation's president in 1935\u201336.", "Pycroft was born in 1875 in Auckland. His mother was Sarah Pycroft () and his father was Henry T. Pycroft (1842\u20131909), a teacher and the eldest son of Sir Thomas Pycroft (1807\u20131892). His grandfather had been a member of the Madras Legislative Council from 1862 to 1867. Henry Pycroft had come to New Zealand in 1866, and Sarah and he married at Wanganui in December 1872."]}]}}
