He made 150 appearances in the English Football League playing for Birmingham City and Derby County.\nBorn in Glengarnock, Ayrshire, Martin began his football career with local club Kilwinning Rangers. He came to England and signed professional forms for First Division Birmingham City in March 1950. By the time he made his first-team debut some nine months later, standing in for the injured Ken Green, the club had been relegated to the Second Division. In six years with the club he made 74 appearances in all competitions but was never first choice at full back, playing only as cover for Green, Jack Badham, and later, the England international Jeff Hall. In March 1956 he joined Derby County, and the following season helped them to win the championship of the Third Division (North).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Martin", "response": ["Roy Martin may refer to:", "* Roy Martin (musician) (born 1961), English drummer", "* Roy Martin (sprinter) (born 1966), American sprinter", "* Roy Martin (footballer) (born 1929), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
