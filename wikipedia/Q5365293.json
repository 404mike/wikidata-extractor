Some philosophical writings were published posthumously, edited by his wife Margaret and sister-in-law Caroline Haddon. The polygamous aspects led to a campaign to discredit him, fronted especially by a group of London radicals, The Men and Women's Club, founded in 1885 to discuss matters of gender and sexuality. Its success led to the discrediting too of his son, Charles Howard, whose bigamy was attributed to his father's theories. In 1887, Charles Howard and Mary Ellen Boole, the eldest daughter of George Boole and Mary Everest, exiled their family to Japan.Gerry Kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press, July 2016"]}, {"page": "William Hopkins", "response": ["He had, with his second wife, one son and three daughters, among them morality campaigner Ellice Hopkins."]}, {"page": "Oxford period poetry anthologies", "response": ["Sir Edwin Arnold \u2013 Alfred Austin \u2013 Aubrey Beardsley \u2013 Robert Bridges \u2013 Edward Carpenter \u2013 Mary Coleridge \u2013 John Davidson \u2013 Austin Dobson \u2013 Digby Mackworth Dolben \u2013 Edward Dowden \u2013 Ernest Dowson \u2013 Mary Duclaux \u2013 Edwin John Ellis \u2013 Michael Field \u2013 Richard Le Gallienne \u2013 Sir W.

She spent her early childhood and early adulthood on the east coast of America, however her transformative social work began in the United Kingdom. Hopkins was responsible for a multitude of organised support groups for the movement and became successful in her appeal to male involvement in ways that other social puritists were not. Her deep dedication to the church not only gave her helpful connections in the spreading of this movement in Europe, but also gave her a characteristic drive and passion for this work. She was able to make changes in very practical ways, such as raising the legal age of consent for women to 16, and in individual moral ways, such as asking good Christian men to pledge themselves to respecting women and dismantling hypocrisy in sexual standards. Her work set a precedence for what was to be done in the United States. There was a gray area in this movement where feminists, eugenicists, and social purists could agree. Feminists were concerned about the sexual exploitation of women as an act of violence against them and eugenicists were concerned with the preservation of the \u2018fittest\u2019 citizens, needing white female chastity to achieve these aspirations. There was some intersection of goals with the social purists in this sense, and they inevitably influenced one another. Religion, feminism, and eugenicists found common ground in the control and/or protection of women's bodies as something sacred and necessary, but only white women's bodies were included in this protection."]}, {"page": "Alice Ellice Hopkins", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ellice Hopkins"]}, {"page": "White Cross Army", "response": ["thumb|The White Cross Army was founded by Ellice HopkinsThe White Cross Army was an organisation set up in 1883 by philanthropist Ellice Hopkins with help from the Bishop of Durham, to promote \"social purity\".
