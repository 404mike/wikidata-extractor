Favoured while playing for Billy Bingham, Ronny was replaced by Dave Thomas once Gordon Lee became the manager of Everton.\nHighlights of his Everton career include scoring from the half-way line at West Ham and playing a major role in 1977 in the run to the final of the League Cup against Aston Villa and the semi-final of the FA Cup against local rivals Liverpool. He was the player who provided the cross for the infamous disallowed \"goal\" by Bryan Hamilton by controversial referee Clive Thomas that would have seen Everton through to the FA Cup final.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1977 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||11|| Ronny Goodlass", "|MF ||11|| Ronny Goodlass", "|MF ||11|| Ronny Goodlass"]}, {"page": "List of foreign football players in the Netherlands", "response": ["*Ronny Goodlass \u2013 FC Den Haag, NAC \u2013 1977\u201380"]}, {"page": "Ronnie Goodlass", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ronny Goodlass"]}]}}
