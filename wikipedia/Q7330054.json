According to biographer Richard Witts in his 1995 book, Nico: The Life and Lies of an Icon, Wilhelm P\u00e4ffgen was gravely wounded in 1942 after having been shot in the head by a French sniper. With no certainty that he would survive, his commanding officer, following standing orders, ended his life by gunshot. Another story is that he sustained head injuries that caused severe brain damage, and spent the rest of his life in a psychiatric institution. According to unproven rumours, he was variously said to have died in a concentration camp, or to have faded away as a result of shell shock.", "In 1946, Nico and her mother relocated to downtown Berlin, where Nico worked as a seamstress. She attended school until the age of 13, and began selling lingerie in the exclusive department store KaDeWe, eventually getting modelling jobs in Berlin. At , and with chiseled features and pale skin, Nico rose to prominence as a fashion model when still a teenager. At the age of 15 while working as a temp for the US Air Force, she was allegedly raped by an American sergeant (although some sources have claimed by an African-American soldier) and she gave evidence at the trial which led to the perpetrator being court-martialed. The incident was referenced in her song Secret Side. However, biographers such as Richard Witts have debated the validity of the story as no public records of the case have been documented.http://www.msrblog.com/arts/biography/biography-of-nico.htmlhttps://psychedelicized.com/playlist/n/nico/https://andygoss.net.au/views-reviews/nico-bios/", "Island Records dropped Nico after she told an interviewer that she did not like \"Negroes\" and that they had \"features like animals\". Nico said she had been raped at the age of thirteen by a black American soldier who had been court-martialed and executed; the biographer Richard Witts could find no record of this, even \"when similar incidents were assiduously documented\".", "Several biographical works on Nico have appeared, both in print and film. The first, in 1992, was Songs They Never Play on the Radio, a book by James Young that draws on his association with Nico in her last years. In 1993, Nico: The Life and Lies of an Icon by musicologist Richard Witts covered Nico's entire life and career. The 1995 documentary Nico Icon by Susanne Ofteringer examined the many facets of Nico's life with contributions from those who knew her, including her colleagues Reed and Cale. In 2015, Lutz Graf-Ulbrich, Nico's former partner and accompanist in the late 1970s, published Nico: In the Shadow of the Moon Goddess, an account of his time with Nico.
