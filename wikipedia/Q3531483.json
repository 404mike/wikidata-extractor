George Brann captained the county's first match after Murdoch stood down but he may have found the position to be too difficult and Ranjitsinhji led the team for the remainder of the season. The press regarded his first season as a success as a late sequence of matches without defeat took Sussex to fifth in the County Championship, the highest position achieved by the team to that point. As captain, Ranjitsinhji took great care over details such as weather conditions, but some of his innovations, such as the frequent changing of the person bowling or implementing fielding practice, were unpopular with the players. He took the opportunity of leading the side to increase the amount of bowling he did, taking 31 wickets in the season. But the team's lack of effective bowlers was a problem before Ranjitsinhji took over."]}, {"page": "1885\u201386 in English football", "response": ["|George Brann (Swifts), Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End) & Andrew Amos (Old Carthusians)"]}, {"page": "Tinsley Lindley", "response": ["It has been claimed that he holds the record for scoring in 9 consecutive England matches between 13 March 1886 and 7 April 1888.
