From the mid 1950s she became a staff producer at the BBC, and was one of the first women to direct plays on television. Family Portrait was one of her first BBC productions, which she originally directed in 1948 at the Strand theatre. It was a controversial play about the life and death of Christ, and was aired on Easter Sunday 1955. It enraged Cardinal Bernard Griffin of Westminster, who denounced it as offensive to Catholics. Gibson later conceded that the criticism was justified, converting to Catholicism in 1959. Among her notable work with the BBC was directing episodes of Maigret and Pepys' diary."]}]}}
