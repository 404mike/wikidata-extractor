During his ensuing career, he dedicated himself to the analysis and research of social ills such as juvenile delinquency and the psychology behind perpetrators of serial killings. Leyton's achieved level of expertise has led to his giving lectures at the College of Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Ottawa.The author/editor of eleven books and numerous scholarly essays for academic journals, Professor Leyton 's 1986 landmark study Hunting Humans is an international bestseller in multiple languages that was reprinted in 1995 and again in 2005. It won the 1987 Arthur Ellis Award for best new crime book. Professor Leyton traveled to Rwanda in the fall of 1996 where he studied the Rwandan genocide that spawned his 1998 book, Touched By Fire: Doctors Without Borders in a Third World Crisis.\nIn 2004, a National Film Board of Canada film about Professor Leyton's life's work titled The Man Who Studies Murder, was premiered at the Montreal Film Festival and aired on CBC Television\u2019s The Nature of Things. Frequently consulted by the media, Professor Leyton was interviewed by CBC Newsworld on September 14, 2006 about the Dawson College shooting in Montreal. He stated that because all three such murderous rampages in Quebec involved a killer who was either an immigrant or a child of immigrants, it warranted an examination of government and societal attitudes that can profoundly impact immigrant perceptions and hence their conduct. The following day, Professor Leyton was the guest expert on CBC Radio One's program The Current that analyzed the Dawson College shooting.Leyton wrote the foreword for the \"Dance With the Devil: A Memoir of Murder and Loss\", a book telling the story of the murder of Zachary Turner.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crime Writers of Canada Awards of Excellence", "response": ["* 1987 - Elliott Leyton, Hunting Humans"]}, {"page": "List of University of Toronto alumni", "response": ["*Elliott Leyton (Ph.D. 1972) \u2013 sociologist, educator and author on serial homicide and juvenile delinquency"]}, {"page": "David Berkowitz", "response": ["In 1971, at the age of 17, Berkowitz joined the United States Army and served in Fort Knox in the United States and with an infantry division in South Korea.Leyton, p. 217.Klausner, p. 32; p. 42. After an honorable discharge in June 1974, he located his birth mother, Betty. After a few visits, she disclosed the details of his birth. The news greatly disturbed Berkowitz, and he was particularly distraught by the array of reluctant father figures. Forensic anthropologist Elliott Leyton described Berkowitz's discovery of his adoption and birth details as the \"primary crisis\" of his life, a revelation that shattered his sense of identity.Leyton, pp. 187ff. His communication with his birth mother later lapsed, but for a time he remained in communication with his half-sister, Roslyn. He attended Bronx Community College for one year, enrolling in the spring of 1975. In 1976 he went to work as a driver for the Co-Op City Taxi Company. He subsequently had several non-professional jobs, and at the time of his arrest was working as a letter sorter for the United States Postal Service.Leyton, p. 192.", "Skeptics included a former FBI profiler, John E. Douglas, who spent hours interviewing Berkowitz. He stated that he was convinced Berkowitz acted alone and was an \"introverted loner, not capable of being involved in group activity.\" NYPD psychologist Dr. Harvey Schlossberg stated in Against The Law, a documentary about the Son of Sam case, that he believes that the Satanic cult claims are nothing but a fantasy concocted by Berkowitz to absolve himself of the crimes. In his book Hunting Humans (2001), Elliott Leyton argued that \"recent journalistic attempts to abridge\u2014or even deny\u2014Berkowitz's guilt have lacked all credibility.\"Leyton, p. 186."]}, {"page": "Dawson College shooting", "response": ["Wong's writing followed the comments of Professor Elliott Leyton, a social-anthropologist who is a widely consulted expert on serial homicide."]}, {"page": "List of Memorial University of Newfoundland people", "response": ["* Elliott Leyton - renowned for studies of serial murderers"]}, {"page": "Leyton (surname)", "response": ["* Elliott Leyton (born 1939), Canadian social-anthropologist, educator and author"]}]}}
