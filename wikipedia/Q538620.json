The daughter of author Capt. Frederick Marryat, she was particularly known for her sensational novels and her involvement with several celebrated spiritual mediums of the late 19th century. Her works include Love\u2019s Conflict (1865), Her Father's Name (1876), There is No Death (1891) and The Spirit World (1894), The Dead Man's Message (1894) and The Blood of the Vampire (1897). She was a prolific author, writing around 70 books, as well as newspaper and magazine articles, short stories and works for the stage.\nFrom 1876 to 1890, she had a performing career, at first writing and performing a comic touring piano sketch entertainment, together with George Grossmith and later performing in dramas, comedies, comic opera with a D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, her own one-woman show, and appearing as a lecturer, dramatic reader and public entertainer.  During the 1890s, she ran a school of Journalism and Literary Art.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gothic fiction", "response": ["In Ireland, Gothic fiction tended to be purveyed by the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Charles Maturin, Sheridan Le Fanu, and Bram Stoker form the core of the Irish Gothic sub-genre with stories featuring castles set in a barren landscape and a cast of remote aristocrats dominating an atavistic peasantry, which represent in allegorical form the political plight of Catholic Ireland subjected to the Protestant Ascendancy.Eagleton, 1995. Le Fanu's use of the gloomy villain, forbidding mansion and persecuted heroine in Uncle Silas (1864) shows direct influence from both Walpole's Otranto and Radcliffe's Udolpho. Le Fanu's short story collection In a Glass Darkly (1872) includes the superlative vampire tale Carmilla, which provided fresh blood for that particular strand of the Gothic and influenced Bram Stoker's vampire novel Dracula (1897). Stoker's book not only created the most famous Gothic villain ever, Count Dracula, but also established Transylvania and Eastern Europe as the locus classicus of the Gothic.Mighall, 2003. Published in the same year as Dracula, Florence Marryat's The Blood of the Vampire is another piece of vampire fiction. The Blood of the Vampire, which, like Carmilla, features a female vampire, is notable for its treatment of vampirism as both racial and medicalised. The vampire, Harriet Brandt, is also a psychic vampire, killing unintentionally."]}, {"page": "Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)", "response": ["According to Gardner's first biographer, Jack Bracelin, Com was very flirtatious and \"clearly looked on these trips as mainly manhunts\", viewing Gardner as a nuisance. As a result, he was largely left to his own devices, which he spent going out, meeting new people and learning about foreign cultures. In Madeira, he also began collecting weapons, many of which were remnants from the Napoleonic Wars, displaying them on the wall of his hotel room. As a result of his illness and these foreign trips, Gardner ultimately never attended school, or gained any formal education. He taught himself to read by looking at copies of The Strand Magazine but his writing betrayed his poor education all his life, with highly eccentric spelling and grammar. A voracious reader, one of the books that most influenced him at the time was Florence Marryat's There Is No Death (1891), a discussion of spiritualism, and from which he gained a firm belief in the existence of an afterlife."]}, {"page": "Vampire literature", "response": ["* The Blood of the Vampire by Florence Marryat (1897)."]}, {"page": "Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["*Florence Marryat (1833\u20131899), novelist, editor, actress and playwright"]}, {"page": "Frederick Marryat", "response": ["Marryat was named a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his invention and other achievements.

They toured almost constantly for the following three years, but they returned to see their families in London on weekends.Grossmith (1888), Chapter V Around this time, he met and became firm friends with Fred Sullivan, and afterwards, he met Sullivan's brother Arthur.Grossmith, George.  \"Sir Arthur Sullivan\",  The Pall Mall Magazine, vol. 23, no. 94 (February 1901), p. 251 Through Arthur Cecil, Sullivan, and some of their friends, Grossmith began to be invited to entertain at private \"society\" parties, which he continued to do throughout his career.  Later, these parties would often occur late in the evening after Grossmith performed at the Savoy Theatre.Grossmith (1888), Chapter VII In 1876, he collaborated with Florence Marryat, the author and reciter, on Entre Nous.  This piece consisted of a series of piano sketches, alternating with scenes and costumed recitations, including a two-person \"satirical musical sketch\", really a short comic opera, called Cups and Saucers, which they then toured. Grossmith also took a number of engagements, including recitals at private homes. In 1877, Lionel Brough introduced another popular Grossmith song, \"The Muddle Puddle Junction Porter\". By then, Grossmith had become friendly with many in the music and theatre establishments, including Arthur Sullivan and impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte; and Grossmith had the opportunity to perform in Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury and other Sullivan works at charity benefits.Grossmith, George. \"Sir Arthur Sullivan: A Personal Reminiscence\".
