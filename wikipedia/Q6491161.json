Stephens was a regular writer of the show for the first two years, and then returned to The Goon Show to assist Milligan, during the latter's tougher moments. From his association with Milligan, Stephens became involved with Associated London Scripts (ALS), and was said to have been \"one of the most eye-catching characters, in the earliest days of the company...he played a significant cameo role in the first phase of success for ALS\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
