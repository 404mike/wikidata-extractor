He is also known as Uncle Frank and TRM which stands for \"The Rhythm Man\". Benbini is a singer, record producer, songwriter and director.\nBenbini joined FLC as their drummer in May 2003 \u2013 although he had known the band for many years previously (their first meeting was at Rock City in Nottingham in 1996) \u2013 after having worked for a while as Mackie's technician. Along with drumming, Benbini also provides backing vocals to tracks on FLC's more recent albums and when performing live with the FLC.\nBenbini is also one half of the Make It Nice Brothers with Naim Cortazzi (a multi instrumentalist and producer). Based in Leicester, England, the Make It Nice Brothers perform in two bands, Uncle Frank and Fatal Star. These two bands each have different musical styles to the Fun Lovin' Criminals - Uncle Frank first being described as \"the music from the Jungle Book blended with Barry White's lush soul vibe and some genius songwriting a la Burt Bacharach\" and Fatal Star as \"devastating campfire harmonies with a mystical eastern edge for arrangements. Delicate, Melodic, Soulful food for hungry dreamers\".Uncle Frank were signed to a three-album deal in 2013 by MITA Records executive David Rogers. Uncle Frank's debut label album Smiles for Miles was released in May 2014 and was described by Penny Black Music as an album \"full of classic, quirky and lovestruck songs\". The band's second single \"Somethin' Somethin'\" accompanied by a robot animation video was featured by The Daily Express \"Frank Benbini and Naim Cortazzi, have spent years making music and their remarkable output ranges from soul to funk and old-school hip hop\".In 2017, Uncle Frank released the album Love Lion which received strong reviews in the indie press. \"There wasn't a song on Love Lion I didn't like. The chords in each track and the melodies were all beautifully tied together, and really soothing to listen to.\"The singles (\"Love Lion\", \"Fountains\" and \"Tokyo\") videos, which accompanied the album, came to the attention of BBC Radio 2 radio and television presenter Craig Charles who featured Uncle Frank on his radio show, as well as inviting the band to support him on his sold out Funk and Soul Club. He would later describe the band, saying \"They tore the stage apart, Uncle Frank, my favourite live band of 2018\".\nIn 2018 Benbini began presenting a regular Sunday evening radio show on BBC Radio Leicester.Benbini and Naim Cortazzi are co-founders of Make it Nice Records which is currently the home of Uncle Frank's releases.Benbini dipped his toes into the realms of acting, being part of the sequel to FLC's film Maui Homicide (currently titled Maui Homicide 2) and also appearing with fellow band member Huey Morgan in Brit flick Clubbing To Death (2008).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fun Lovin' Criminals", "response": ["In June 1999 the band played at Glastonbury Festival on the Pyramid Stage. Their December 1999 album Mimosa, released by EMI was a compilation album consisting mostly of laid back lounge style covers and different versions of earlier released tracks. While making reasonable sales, the album was their weakest selling album yet and remained so for some years. It was around this time, in 1999, that Steve Borgovini left the band. He was replaced by Maxwell \"Mackie\" Jayson. A permanent replacement was found in 2003 in the form of Mark Reid (aka Frank Benbini) from Leicester, United Kingdom, who had previously worked with the band as Jayson's technician."]}, {"page": "Uncle Frank", "response": ["* Uncle Frank, an alternative stage name of Frank Benbini, the drummer and one third of the Fun Lovin' Criminals"]}, {"page": "List of people from Leicester and Leicestershire", "response": ["*Frank Benbini (drummer, Fun Lovin Criminals)"]}, {"page": "Tunnelmental", "response": ["A new single \"Defending the Dreamers\" was released in January 2011 with additional remixes by \"Radio Riddler\" (Brian Leiser and Frank Benbini from Fun Lovin' Criminals) and \"Dekvanhype\" (Derek Pippert).
