He reached the 2004 Football Conference play-off Final with Aldershot Town, and after another unsuccessful play-off campaign in the 2004\u201305 season signed for Exeter City in 2005. He played in the 2007 Conference National play-off Final defeat before returning to Rushden in 2007. He left for Cambridge United a year later, playing for them in the 2009 Conference Premier play-off Final. After spells with Forest Green Rovers, Mansfield Town, Brackley Town, Newport County and Kettering Town, Challinor signed for York City in 2011.

He appeared twice at right-back in the first two months of the season when Lanre Oyebanjo was absent, before falling behind Jon Challinor and Jamal Fyfield for a place in defence. Parslow was used mostly as a substitute from then before a run starting in central defence in late December 2011, before losing his place after the signing of Chris Doig in February 2012. He was restored to the starting line-up in early March 2012 due to other defenders being unavailable, before Doig once again took his place in the team. He returned to the starting line-up in early April 2012 due to Smith's absence and started 10 of York's last 11 fixtures of the season. Parslow won the 2012 FA Trophy Final with York at Wembley Stadium on 12 May 2012, in which they beat Newport County 2\u20130. Eight days later, he played in the 2\u20131 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, seeing the club return into the Football League after an eight-year absence with promotion into League Two.
