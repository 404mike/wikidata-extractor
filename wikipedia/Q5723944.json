Edward Williams was a master at creating scenes with complex lighting in which the figures, often people and boats, were subordinate to the scenery, in an age when landscape painters were considered subordinate to figure painters. His sons developed this style further, each adding their own variations. Their paintings were extremely popular in Victorian England and remain so today. Examples of the work of Edward Williams and all six of his sons, as well as several of his grandchildren hang today in prominent museums, and some Williams family paintings, especially those of Henry John Boddington and Sidney Richard Percy, command impressive prices at auction.S R Percy's Landscape with cattle and figures, 1875 sold in 2000 at Phillips London for $195,656 USD, and his Lever's waters, Coniston, 1875 sold in 2008 at Sotheby's London for $147,259 USD. Some of Henry Boddington's works have approached the $100,000 USD sales mark, and at least four of Sidney Richard Percy's paintings have exceed that. www.findartinfo.com and www.artinfo.com.
