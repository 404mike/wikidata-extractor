Another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate: a lesson he never forgot. A third effect was to serve notice that Darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed: on the contrary, they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority.Darwin F. (ed) 1897\u201399.

More letters of Charles Darwin. 2 vols, Murray, London. II, 204 Leonard Huxley: \"The importance... lay in the open resistance that was made to authority\". A fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science, with its implied need for scientific education. A fifth consequence was indirect: as Wilberforce had feared, a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the Old Testament, especially the Book of Genesis. Many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate; they were supporters, perhaps, of the controversial Essays and Reviews. Thus, both on the side of science and on that of religion, the debate was important and its outcome significant.Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science.
