In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time, Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position, including his two other previous Premier League clubs. Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment, Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games, and after his recovery, Joe Kinnear would return as manager after the end of the season. Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8-week sabbatical from his Match of the Day role. Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement, with Shearer stating that \"the people that have moved, were moving on anyways, that had nothing to do with me\". Wise's presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager. Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the Monday on the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant.

It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign Gonz\u00e1lez after watching him \"on YouTube\". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal.

This manifested itself on the pitch as the club struggled to direct itself clear of the relegation zone. However a highlight was Given saving a Kevin Nolan penalty in a 1\u20130 win over Bolton Wanderers. On 2 January 2009, following the 5\u20131 defeat at home against Liverpool, the player's lawyer released a statement saying that his client was \"considering his future\" at Newcastle, and requested permission to talk to representatives of Manchester City on 28 January after the club made a bid of \u00a35\u00a0million which was subsequently rejected. Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear had already stated that the club was \"not interested at all in selling him\", and described the amount on offer for Given as \"insulting\". However, on 30 January, it was reported that Newcastle had given permission for Given to enter talks with his suitors. After a transfer fee initially reported to be around \u00a38\u00a0million was agreed between the clubs, Given signed for Manchester City on 1 February, with the transfer window set to close the following day. Although the fee for Given was expected to be around \u00a38\u00a0million, in February 2009 Newcastle United managing director Derek Llambias revealed at a supporters panel meeting that Given had been sold for an initial \u00a35.9\u00a0million.

His return had an instant impact on club ticket sales as he sat with the fans, Mike Ashley and Chris Mort for the FA Cup replay 4\u20131 win against Stoke City. Following his return, Keegan had a disappointing first ten games back, with the club not winning a single game until his decision to include strikers Obafemi Martins, Michael Owen and Mark Viduka into a 4\u20133\u20133 formation, which saw the club back on goal-scoring and winning form  and eventually finishing 12th in 2007\u201308. In May Keegan met with Mike Ashley and Director of Football Dennis Wise after he had suggested Champions League qualification was out of Newcastle United's reach and expressed dissatisfaction with the board's financial backing. Ashley was battling reports that he had lost hundreds of millions of pounds in a disastrous attempt to rescue bank HBOS. The morning following, after the club's 3\u20130 defeat to Arsenal, rumours were circulating that Keegan had either been sacked or resigned as Newcastle boss, citing board interference and his lack of control over transfers. Keegan confirmed the reports the same week, and reportedly held unsuccessful resolution talks with Mike Ashley the following week, leading to fan fury and protests around St James' Park, and marring the club's home defeat to Hull City, with fans accusing Ashley and club executives Dennis Wise, Tony Jimenez and Derek Llambias of forcing Keegan out.", "Prior to the start of the 2009\u201310 season, Keegan's dispute with the club was resolved after a Premier League Arbitration Panel ruled that he had been misled to believe he had the final word on the club's transfer policy when in fact Director of Football Dennis Wise had been handed such control. The signings of Xisco and Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez were ruled to have been made without the manager's approval; with Gonz\u00e1lez, Dennis Wise signed him only after viewing him off of YouTube. Wise and Derek Llambias were ruled to have deliberately misled the media to believe Keegan had the final say, which amounted to constructive dismissal. Keegan was awarded \u00a32 million in compensation  and re-offered his job as Newcastle United manager under fresh new terms, though in response to the offer, he stated the fans had \"had enough\" for the time being and declined.

Particularly as Ashley's initial offer was insufficient and he had to be provide another \u00a31m of funding less than a month later. In exchange for the initial funding, Ashley was granted critical power at the club with the privilege to put forward the names of two nominees for appointment to the board as well as security over Edmiston House and the Albion car park. As a consequence of his power grab both Philip Nash and Graham Wallace were forced out of the club and Derek Llambias and Barry Leach were brought in, initially as consultants before being appointed Chief executive and Finance director respectively. Also David Somers was named executive chairman but on a temporary basis in order to aid the transition. Financial respite was short lived as Rangers announced its preliminary results at the end of November indicating the club required another \u00a38m of investment to see out the season. This effectively left Rangers at the mercy of Ashley who could dictate the terms of and source of any future funding. Due to this power, the Scottish Football Association issued Ashley with a notice of complaint for breached a joint agreement that Ashley would not play a controlling role in Rangers and would maintain a stake of no more than 10%. As Ashley had previously loaned the club \u00a32m and a further \u00a31m as well as having two directors on the Rangers board and a significant interest in Rangers retail operations, although, he did return the naming rights to Ibrox Stadium to Rangers. On Christmas Eve, the SFA denied him permission to increase his stake-hold in Rangers further. Also in December, the Scottish Professional Football League added to Rangers financial woes by withholding \u00a3250,000 of broadcast money the club was due in a bid to recoup a fine imposed by the Nimmo Smith Commission.", "The month of February a large volume of share purchase and Rangers supporters groups are heavily involved. With the writing apparently on the wall, Rangers director James Easdale resigned just over a week before the EGM and chairman Somers departed with fours days to go. The SFA's investigation into Ashley concluded at the beginning of March with Ashley being deemed to have broken rules on dual ownership due to his influence on the affairs of Rangers, he was fined \u00a37,500, and Rangers were subsequently fined \u00a35,500 over a month later for their lack of governance. Just two days before the EGM, the club's Nominated adviser, WH Ireland, resigned resulting shares in the Plc being suspended. The outcome of the EGM was a decisive victory for King's consortium with Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach being voted off the board and King, Paul Murray and John Giligan moving in. Both King and Murray subsequently applied to be passed as a fit and proper person by the SFA with the later being cleared at the beginning of May. Further board appointments were made with John Bennett and Chris Graham added to the Plc board as non-executive directors and James Blair was appointed company secretary, however, Graham resigned his directorship only three days later. On the same day as the appointments Rangers suspended Llambias, Leach and Sandy Easdale from its football club board pending an internal investigation.", "Away from football, the board instigated court proceedings against four of its former executives and investor Mike Ashley. The case against former chief executives Charles Green and Derek Llambias, former commercial director Imran Ahmad, former financial director Brian Stockbridge and Ashley was brought regarding a loss of income caused by retail deals agreed between the company that owns the club and Sports Direct from 2012 to 2015. Details of Rangers legal claim was revealed on 12 August after Ashley's lawyers succeeded in a bid to the documents disclosed. According to the papers lodged with the Court of Session, Rangers sought approximately \u00a34.1m in damages caused by alleged negligence by Green and other club staff from which Ashley unfairly benefited. Rangers regained representation at a domestic football level as Managing director Stewart Robertson was appointed to the SFA professional game board, although Robertson had initially signalled his intent to stand for the SPFL board but withdrew due to a lack of support. Meanwhile, the former Rangers owner Craig Whyte was the only person facing fraud charges relating to the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc, proceedings began in June. In a bizarre twist, former Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay QC was appointed to Whyte's legal team and defended Whyte when he faced charges relating to the acquisition of the club in May 2011 and its subsequent financial mismanagement. On 22 December, at his pre-trial Whyte entered a not guilty plea at the High Court in Glasgow.
