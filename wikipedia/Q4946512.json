She is best known by two hymns, \"Just As I Am\" and \"Thy will be done\".Elliott edited Christian Remembrancer Pocket Book (1834\u201359) and The Invalid's Hymn book, 6th edition, 1854. To this latter collection, she contributed 112 hymns including \"Just As I Am, without one plea\", a hymn dated 1836, which was translated into almost every living language of the day. In spite of being raised in a Christian home, she reflected on her conflicts and doubts and was unsure of her relationship with Christ. So she penned her words of assurance about Jesus loving her \"just as she was\". William B. Bradbury composed music for her lyrics and published the song in 1849. The hymn was translated into many languages, with tens of thousands of people committing their lives to Christ during the playing of it. She also wrote \"My God and Father while I stray\", 1834, in the same collection. Elliott was the author of Hymns for a week, 1837, 40th thousand, 1871; Hours of Sorrow, 1836 and many later editions, Poems by C. E., 1863. An invalid for many years, her life was filled with deeds of beneficence. She shrank from everything ostentatious, nearly all her books having been issued anonymously.", "link_mentions": {}}}
