She co-founded its first branch in London with Minnie Baldock. Kenney attracted the attention of the press and public in 1905 when she and Christabel Pankhurst were imprisoned for several days for assault and obstruction, after questioning Sir Edward Grey at a Liberal rally in Manchester on the issue of votes for women. The incident is credited with inaugurating a new phase in the struggle for women's suffrage in the UK, with the adoption of militant tactics. Annie had friendships with Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Baroness Pethick-Lawrence, Mary Blathwayt, Clara Codd, Adela Pankhurst and Christabel Pankhurst.", "Annie had many close friendships with women in the Suffragette Movement, Christabel Pankhurst and Kenney were allegedly lovers. She and Christabel went on holiday to Sark together, and some sources suggest the relationship was platonic rather than romantic. Annie was a family friend of the Blathwayts. She was a frequent visitor to Eagle House, and unlike everyone else she planted four trees. The Blaythwaits paid for presents and watches, and paid her medical and dentistry bills for both her and her sisters. Mary Blathwayt made notes in her diary of the women Kenney slept with when she stayed at the Blathwayt's home, Eagle House. Blathwayt's romantic jealousy has been proposed as a reason. She noted ten alleged short-lived lovers. According to Mary, she shared beds with herself, Clara Codd and Adela Pankhurst."]}, {"page": "Bishop's Tawton", "response": ["Notable residents included Clara Codd, the suffragette and theosophist, who was born in Pill, Bishop's Tawton in October 1877."]}, {"page": "Mabel Capper", "response": ["* In October 1908, Capper took part in the Rush on the House of Commons, together with Christabel Pankhurst, Emmeline Pankhurst and other suffragettes, like Clara Codd with whom she conspired to cause a distraction to  get Codd past the police line .
