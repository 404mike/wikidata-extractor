Leach sent three commissioners to Milan to interrogate Caroline's former servants, including Theodore Majocchi and Caroline's maid, Louise Demont.Robins, pp. 76\u201377 In London, Brougham was still acting as Caroline's agent. Concerned that the \"Milan commission\" might threaten Caroline, he sent his brother James to Caroline's villa in the hope of establishing whether George had any grounds for divorce. James wrote back to his brother of Caroline and Pergami, \"they are to all appearances man and wife, never was anything so obvious.\"Letter from James Brougham to his brother Henry, quoted in Robins, p. 79 The Milan commission was assembling more and more evidence, and by 1819 Caroline was worried. She informed James Brougham that she would agree to a divorce in exchange for money.Robins, p. 79 However, at this time in England divorce by mutual consent was illegal; it was only possible to divorce if one of the partners admitted or was found guilty of adultery. Caroline said it was \"impossible\" for her to admit that, so the Broughams advised that only formal separation was possible.Robins, p. 80 Both keen to avoid publicity, the Broughams and the Government discussed a deal where Caroline would be called by a lesser title, such as \"Duchess of Cornwall\" rather than \"Princess of Wales\". As the negotiations continued at the end of 1819, Caroline travelled to France, which gave rise to speculation that she was on her way back to England. In January 1820, however, she made plans to return to Italy, but then on 29 January 1820 King George III died. Caroline's husband became king and, at least nominally, she was queen of the United Kingdom.Robins, p. 82"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1714\u20131820)", "response": ["*John Leach (1760\u20131834)"]}, {"page": "Chancellor of the High Court", "response": ["* 17 January 1818: Sir John Leach"]}, {"page": "John Leach", "response": ["John Leach is the name of:", "*John Leach (judge) (1760\u20131834), English judge", "*John Leach (Royal Navy officer) (1894\u20131941), Royal Navy captain", "*John Leach (MP), British Member of the UK Parliament for West Surrey (1832)", "*John Leach (footballer) (1866\u20131931), English footballer", "*John Leach (cricketer) (1846\u20131893), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Seaford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["In the early 19th century the patrons were John Leach and Charles Rose Ellis, who used his influence to occupy one of the seats himself for many years; his elevation to the peerage as Lord Seaford in 1826 may have owed not a little to his commanding a seat in the House of Commons.", "|rowspan=3|John Leach"]}, {"page": "Justice of Chester", "response": ["|John Leach || rowspan=4| Thomas Jervis"]}, {"page": "John Leach (Judge)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Leach (judge) "]}]}}
