He has been a leading member of the Socialist Workers Party before retiring to Ireland, where he became active in the Irish SWP and is editor of Irish Marxist Review.\nMolyneux was a lecturer at the School of Art, Design and Media, University of Portsmouth, from 1992.During his time in Portsmouth he organised a number of demonstrations, including getting 12 coaches of people to the 2003 demonstration against the Iraq War, in London. In January 2009 he was arrested for organising a peace rally of 400 people against the Israeli attacks on Gaza.He is known for writing a bulletin headed \"Democracy in the SWP\", which argued that, though the SWP is democratic, it needs to be more so, prompting the Weekly Worker, the organ of the Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee) to call him a \"loyal rebel\". In 2006, he set up a blog where he \"writes mainly about Marxist theory and art\".His book The Point Is to Change It! was included in a display at the Tate Liverpool's exhibition Art turning Left (2013) showing the role that art plays in changing society.In October 2020, he hosted the podcast Introduction to Marx/Marxism, which was described as \"a series of short introductions to the ideas of Marx/Marxism\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anarchism", "response": ["Friedrich Engels, considered to be one of the principal founders of Marxism, criticised anarchism's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian. Academic John Molyneux writes in his book Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism that \"anarchism cannot win\", believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas. The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining."]}, {"page": "Animal Farm", "response": ["* Animal Farm Revisited by John Molyneux, International Socialism, 44 (1989)"]}, {"page": "John Molyneux (Trotskyist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Molyneux (academic)"]}, {"page": "John Molyneux", "response": ["John Molyneux may refer to:", "* John Molyneux (academic), British socialist writer and Marxist politician", "* John Molyneux (MP for Nottinghamshire) (died 1588), MP for Nottinghamshire", "* John Molyneux (MP for Liverpool), in 1584, MP for Liverpool", "* John Molyneux (MP for Wigan), represented Wigan (UK Parliament constituency)", "* Sir John Molyneux, 1st Baronet (fl. 1605\u20131640), High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire", "* John Molyneux (VC) (1890\u20131972), recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* John Molyneux (footballer) (1931\u20132018), footballer for Liverpool F.C. in the 1950s"]}, {"page": "Criticism of postmodernism", "response": ["Art historian John Molyneux, also of the Socialist Workers' Party, attacks postmodernists for \"singing an old song long intoned by bourgeois historians of various persuasions\".John Molyneux, Is Marxism deterministic?
