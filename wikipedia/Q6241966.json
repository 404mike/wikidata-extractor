He was involved in most of Southampton's attacks and when John Bainbridge swung over a deep cross from the right it appeared to have been over hit and going out of play.

Described by the Saints' historians, Holley and Chalk, as \"a consistent performer with all his previous clubs\", Hodgkinson was \"still developing as a dashing outside-left\" when he came to Southampton. He made his debut for the Saints on 7 September 1907, when he scored in a 3\u20132 defeat at home to Crystal Palace. He soon formed useful partnerships with his fellow Welsh forward John Lewis and with George Smith, going on to make 29 appearances in 1907\u201308, scoring nine goals as Southampton finished the league season in mid-table.

His debut came on 7 September 1908 in a 4\u20131 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, when Frank Jefferis scored a hat-trick. He soon became established at left-half, alongside Frank Thorpe or Sam Jepp in the centre and John Johnston on the right, although Trueman was able to play in any of the half-back positions. In the 1908\u201309 season, Trueman made 31 league appearances, with Southampton finishing third in the table, having led the table until a run of injuries to key players such as Thorpe and Jefferis in mid-season disrupted the side."]}]}}
