James's role on the show included conducting the \"Almost Legendary Pop Interviews\", interviewing  musical acts including Elvis Costello, Sting, The Clash, Mot\u00f6rhead, and Kate Bush, and serving as music editor.\nBefore joining Tiswas, James was an actress, appearing in the films To Sir, with Love (1967), Journey to the Unknown (1969), The Railway Children (1970), and Never Too Young to Rock (1975). Her television roles included parts in Castle Haven (1969), Cousin Bette (1971), and The Black Arrow (1973\u201374). She was a presenter on Saturday Scene (later known as Supersonic Saturday Scene), starting in 1974, and interviewed pop stars in a segment of the show. James was a member of the Four Bucketeers group, whose single \"Bucket Of Water Song\" reached No. 26 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980. Her book Sally James' Almost Legendary Pop Interviews was published in 1981. After Tiswas ended in 1982, James presented Ultra Quiz in 1982.

On the programme, Birmingham folk-singer and comedian Jasper Carrott was to introduce the nation to the \"Dying Fly Dance\"\u2014and also to many local hospital casualty wards, for the dance at one point soared high in the RoSPA list of common causes of household injury.

Sally James was drafted in as the series' first regular female presenter. She had been the presenter of a regional Saturday morning show in London called Saturday Scene, produced by LWT. Comedian Jim Davidson was intended to be a regular presenter but left after only a few editions, although he would return for cameo appearances. Peter Tomlinson was axed as a regular, which came as a surprise to him.", "Midway through this series, Chris Tarrant decided to leave upon its conclusion. Bob Carolgees, Lenny Henry and John Gorman also left after the final edition of series 7.

The only regular Tiswas presenter left was Sally James, who stayed on for series 8.", "The new presenting team consisted of Midlands DJ Gordon Astley, former Darts frontman Den Hegarty and comic impressionist Fogwell Flax. Veteran Tiswas presenter Sally James stayed on and became the series' Music Editor, but decided to leave towards the series' end. This was likely to be a factor in Central Television's decision not to bring the programme back for a ninth series.", "In late 2005, ITV's Saturday morning show Ministry of Mayhem had a special edition featuring presenters from past Saturday morning shows, including Tiswas. Representing Tiswas was Sally James, although Chris Tarrant did a video link-up for a brief interview during the show.

Some of the most repeated clips from the series have made the grade for this compilation - notably some News Flash sketches with Lenny Henry as 'Trevor McDoughnut' (including one where the target of the spoof - Trevor McDonald - takes over as a surprise) and the 'viewer's letters' clip where Sally James is pied and drenched in semolina, baked beans and custard.

According to Sally James, \"John came in one day and he said \u2018I\u2019ve sort of got this idea\u2019. It\u2019s a march basically, and we all sing this song. And it\u2019s another excuse to chuck buckets of water! So obviously we didn\u2019t do it in the studio. We had this little area outside the back of the studio where a camera would sort of poke out of the window, so we ended the show down there marching about, sploshing all this water from the buckets. And then the next week it was incredible, because the people were jamming the switchboard, \u2018I\u2019ve got to have this record!\u2019. There was never any idea that it would be a record, but of course we did quickly make a record and it became a hit. It just all happened so left-of-field and so unplanned\u2026but then that\u2019s how a lot of things did happen in Tiswas.
