The Institute closed in 1946, soon after the end of the war.", "Early in 1941 twelve volunteers, pacifist conscientious objectors, recruited via the Sheffield Pacifist Service Unit, were established in a large house\"Fairholme\", 18 Oakholme Drive, Broomhill, Sheffield in a residential area of Sheffield for research that would \"benefit humanity\".  Various medical experiments were conducted on the volunteers.  No work that had a direct military application was undertaken since this would not have been acceptable to many conscientious objectors.  This establishment became known as the Sorby Research Institute, so named because the leading researcher, Kenneth Mellanby, was a Sorby Research Fellow  of the Royal Society at Sheffield University.  The fellowship is itself named after Henry Clifton Sorby, a notable Sheffield scientist.  Hans Adolf Krebs took over the management of the volunteers in 1943 when Mellanby left to work for the army."]}, {"page": "Edward Impey", "response": ["Impey was born on 28 May 1962 to Oliver Impey and Jane Mellanby.
