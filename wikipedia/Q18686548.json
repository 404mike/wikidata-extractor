Reserves and Academy", "response": ["Brentford Reserves was formed to give young players and first team players returning from injury game time in a competitive environment. The ever-changing structure of the game in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the Brentford reserve team included in leagues competing against the first teams of amateur clubs. On occasion, the reserve team would compete in two leagues simultaneously. Upon the Football League's acceptance of the Premier League's Elite Player Performance Plan in 2011, which replaced reserve teams with U21 Development Squads, the reserve team was permanently disbanded. Winger Micky Ball made the most appearances for the reserve team, 159, without having ever made a first team appearance.

First team goalkeeper Gerry Cakebread's durability meant that a spell doing national service saw Ryecraft confined to the club's reserve team, until the first team's relegation to the Fourth Division in 1962. Ryecraft finally made his first team debut in a 2\u20131 defeat to Gillingham on 21 August 1962. He went on to make 18 appearances during a 1962\u201363 season which saw the Bees return to the Third Division at the first time of asking. Ryecraft made 20 appearances during the 1963\u201364 season, but mainly appeared for the reserves and was released at the end of the campaign. Ryecraft made a total of 38 first team appearances for the Bees and along with Micky Ball and Johnny Hales, he is one of three players to make over 150 appearances for the Brentford reserve team."]}, {"page": "1958\u201359 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Johnny Hales", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Johnny Hales", "| Johnny Hales"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Johnny Hales", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Johnny Hales", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Johnny Hales"]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Brentford started the 1960\u201361 season well and topped the table after winning the first two matches, but a 6\u20131 defeat to Watford at Vicarage Road on 30 August 1960 shook the team's confidence. The same XI atoned for that display with a 4\u20130 victory over Shrewsbury Town four days later, but the view had become prevalent around Griffin Park that some of Brentford's settled XI were past their peak. Manager MacDonald tinkered with his squad and bit-part, reserve or youth players Tommy Higginson, John Docherty, Ron Peplow and Johnny Hales were given runs in the team.
