Soon after, Lane suggested that Wakeman talk with Bill Bruford and John Wetton who were thinking of forming a new band. After a private meeting, the three rehearsed for six weeks before the story was reported in Melody Maker in October 1976, which effectively caused the group to end.Wooding 1979, p. 175.

Although Thompson's script got him some more jobs in Hollywood, it wasn't picked up until a few years later. Laura Gregory, producer and head of Challenge Films and production manager Susan Nicoletti discovered the script and thought it had great potential. They hired Tony Maylam to direct the film but wanted Thompson to make some changes to the script. His script was an action, horror and buddy cop film with occult overtones which took place in modern Los Angeles. The film included a ritualistic serial killer who had committed five murders every five years for the last quarter of the century and always leaves pentagram symbols after each death. One of the reasons why changes were demanded is because the script was considered to be too similar to another horror thriller which came out around the same time, The First Power (1990). Thompson changed the script during re-writes and his new version, titled Black Tide, was very close to the final film. It was set in a futuristic London which became flooded due to the effects of global warming. This new version of the script was sent to Rutger Hauer who loved it and agreed to star in the film. Though Thompson originally wrote the script with Harrison Ford in mind for the main role, he was happy that Hauer was cast as the lead.", "Category:Films directed by Tony Maylam"]}, {"page": "The Burning (film)", "response": ["The Burning is a 1981 American slasher film directed by Tony Maylam, and starring Brian Matthews, Leah Ayres, Brian Backer, Larry Joshua, and Lou David.
