At the time of his death, Gilbert was one of the most well-known figures in English society and there were plans to make a film about him. He was then disregarded for decades, until critic Richard Dorment published a biography of Gilbert in 1985, which was followed by a retrospective at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1986.

Reviewers welcomed the opportunity to view paintings by Schiele and Klimt, rarely seen in the UK, but expressed dismay at the way the exhibition was hung, that the order of works was not chronological, and over the paucity of information about the works and their sitters. Richard Dorment for The Daily Telegraph thought the show more of an illustrated lecture than an exhibition, while Jackie Wullschlager of The Financial Times called it a \"heartbreaking missed opportunity\". Adrian Searle of The Guardian thought the exhibition both \"dizzying and depressing\" but not an exhibition about great portraiture, as much about Vienna itself as its portraitists and sitters. His colleague Laura Cumming complained the show was frustratingly chaotic and observed it was most alive when depicting death. Brian Sewell of The Evening Standard shared concerns over the way the exhibition was organised, nevertheless welcomed the opportunity to view some lesser known names, although trenchant in his dismissal of Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg's work: \"The most unwise of these excursions is the exaltation as artist-genius, even comparing him with Van Gogh, of the composer Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, 26 and penniless in 1900, his crass amateur paintings \"untainted\" by training, deliberately naive \u2013 a folly equalled only by our acceptance, a century later, of Paul McCartney as a painter\"."]}, {"page": "2014 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Richard Dorment, Chief Art Critic, Daily Telegraph.
