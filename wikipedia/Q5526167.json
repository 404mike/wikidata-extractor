Kick off was delayed by 15 minutes as a result of the large crowd of 29,742.  Leeds' Mark Aizlewood received a booking in the 13th minute for a late tackle while Oldham's Mike Milligan was booked a minute later.  The best chance of the first half fell to Sheridan whose curling free kick was caught by Andy Goram in the Oldham goal.  The only goal of the game came in the 89th minute when Keith Edwards, who had come on as a substitute 17 minutes earlier, scored a header at the near post to give Leeds a one-goal advantage. The second leg of the semi-final was played three days later at Boundary Park.  Oldham opened the scoring in the 18th minute when Gary Williams headed in a cross from Denis Irwin. It would take until the 89th minute before Oldham's substitute Mike Cecere headed in from another Irwin cross to put his team ahead 2\u20130. A minute later, Baird knocked down a cross from Sheridan for Edwards to score through a group of players, making the aggregate score 2\u20132, and sending the game into extra time.  No further goals were scored, and Leeds progressed to the final on the away goals rule."]}, {"page": "Gary Williams (disambiguation)", "response": ["Gary Williams (born 1945) is an American basketball player and coach.", "*Gary Williams (singer) (born 1970), English singer", "*Gary Williams (Ultravox) (fl. 1990s), British musician, member of Ultravox", "*Gary Williams (American football) (born 1959), American NFL football player", "*Gary Williams (footballer, born 1954), English footballer for Preston, Brighton and Crystal Palace", "*Gary Williams (footballer, born 1959), English footballer for Blackpool, Swindon and Tranmere", "*Gary Williams (footballer, born 1960), English footballer for Aston Villa", "*Gary Williams (footballer, born 1963), English footballer for Bristol City and Oldham", "*Gary Williams (Australian footballer) (born 1950), Australian rules footballer", "*Gary Williams (English cricketer) (born 1965), English cricketer", "*Gary Williams (wrestler) (born 1972), Canadian wrestler", "*Gary Williams (sportscaster), host of the Golf Channel's Morning Drive", "*Gary Williams (activist), Aboriginal Australian activist involved with the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in the 1970s", "*Gary Williams (politician), American politician, member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives"]}, {"page": "Gary Williams (footballer born 1963)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gary Williams (footballer, born 1963)"]}]}}
