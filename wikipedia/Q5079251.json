He was president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between December 1867 and December 1869.Charles was the son of Dr Olinthus Gilbert Gregory, a master of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.  The  chair of mathematics at that time was held by Charles Hutton, who acted as Dr. Gregory's patron.  It was in Hutton's honour that Charles was named.Gregory was consulting engineer of several major railway construction works, including those in Ceylon, Trinidad, Cape Colony, Perak and Selangor.  He was the first to use railway semaphore signalling which he employed first at New Cross on the London and Croydon Railway in 1841, and the South Eastern Railways in 1842-3.  This method later superseded all others and was dominant from 1870.  In 1882 he was a member of the Channel Tunnel Committee and in 1886 was a Royal Commissioner for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition.With these uses in mind, he was interested in the properties of the less usual timbers. In 1886 he, in the company of other leading figures such as Sir Philip Cunliffe-Owen, Sir John Coode and Sir Frederick Bramwell, attended an exhibition at the Chelsea works of A. Ransome and Co, manufacturers of woodworking equipment. There they saw experiments on more than 40 different varieties of colonial timber, including Karri wood and Jarrah from Western Australia, and Padouk from India.Gregory was instrumental in furthering the careers of many fellow engineers, e.g.\nFrederick George Slessor (1831-1905) -- in 1874, appointed to the staff of Cape Government Railways, first as Chief Officer of Surveys and Resident Engineer, and then Chief Resident Engineer of the Eastern system.\nFrank Alexander Brown Geneste (1842-1888) \u2013 in 1877, appointed as an Assistant (later District) Engineer on Cape Government Railways, in the construction of the Beaufort West Extension.\nHenry David Alexander Reid (1856-1899) \u2013 in 1878, to take charge of the construction of a section of the Kandy and Matalit Railway in Ceylon.\nWilliam Hugh Woodcock (1844-1908) -- In 1892, appointed to report to the Cape Government on the condition of the bridges on the railways throughout the Colony;  the best method complete the Cape Town Harbour Works.Gregory was a Freemason for much of his working life, and was a member of at least six Lodges. On 7 December 1869 he was given Freedom of the City of London by the Worshipful Company of Turners. He was Master Turner of the Company in 1879, when King Leopold II of the Belgians was presented with honorary membership for \"his skill and keenness as an amateur turner\". Gregory was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1876, and appointed KCMG in May 1884.In 1894, Sir Charles married Fanny Stirling, an actress who died the following year.  Gregory died in London on 10 January 1898, and was buried beside his wife. \u201cThe grave is on the west side of the main avenue of Brompton Cemetery, not very far from the Richmond Road entrance\u201d.In his will, Sir Charles bequeathed \u00a31,000 to \"Thomas Olinthus Donaldson, of Lee\". This was the son of Thomas Leverton Donaldson, architect and co-founder of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Thomas Olinthus was presumably a godson of Sir Charles's father, Olinthus Gregory.", "link_mentions": {}}}
