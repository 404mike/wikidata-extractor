As noted above, A History of the University in Europe lists Durham as the third oldest university in England, and Oxford historian William Whyte similarly states: \"Thus it was that the first new university for almost 250 years was founded\u2014and funded\u2014by the amply endowed Bishop of Durham. Durham University was established by Act of Parliament in 1832 and granted a Royal Charter five years later in 1837.\" The \u2018\u2019Handbook of Comparative Higher Education Law\u2019\u2019 follows the legal definition of a university, saying \"In the 1830s the creation of the Universities of Durham (1832) and London (1836) finally ended the Oxbridge monopoly\". The historian and politician Sir John Marriott also named Durham as the third university, saying \"A third University had been established at Durham in 1832, and four years later London University came into being, but only as an examining body, until in 1900 it was endowed with the full status of a teaching University with a number of constituent colleges.\" Other historians generally concur, with some stating that \"using the date of the incorporating Act of Parliament or Royal Charter as the founding date\" is \"accepted practice\" in naming Durham as third."]}]}}
