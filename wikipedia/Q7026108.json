In his 2004 book, The Deceivers, historian Thaddeus Holt identifies Clarke as \"the master of the game\", having been immersed in his deception activities for the entire war. Clarke evolved deception, almost from scratch, as a vital part of Allied strategy. The organisation that he and Wavell established proved a model for the other theatres of war, and his successes directly led to the creation of the London Controlling Section in 1941. He also misled German intelligence for several years\u00a0\u2013 to the extent that they overestimated Allied strength in North Africa by a quarter of a million men. The journalist Nicholas Rankin, writing in 2008, referred to Clarke as \"the greatest British deceiver of WW2, a special kind of secret servant.\""]}, {"page": "David Strangeways", "response": ["In 1943, General Bernard Montgomery took command of 21st Army Group and requested that Strangeways take charge of R-Force.
