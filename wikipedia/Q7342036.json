Robert Benson, his cousin, and Henry Hatcher received no small help from him in writing their History of Salisbury  (1843), which formed part of Hoare's Wiltshire. He helped John Gough Nichols in the works undertaken for the Camden Society. In 1848 he brought out some parts of a continuation of John Strype's Ecclesiastical Annals in a publication called the Surplice, but this paper and Ballard's scheme soon came to an end. He wrote occasionally in The Gentleman's Magazine, and in Notes and Queries. He died at Islington on 14 February 1860, leaving a son, Edward Ballard, a medical inspector and author of several medical works, and a daughter."]}]}}
