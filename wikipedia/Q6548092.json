During the Second World War she organised exhibitions at the National Gallery, whose collections had been removed to the country for safety. She wrote a number of monographs on 20th-century artists, including important works on Walter Sickert and Sir William Nicholson.

In 1941 a request from an artist to see Rembrandt's Portrait of Margaretha de Geer (a new acquisition) resulted in the \"Picture of the Month\" scheme, in which a single painting was removed from Manod and exhibited to the general public in the National Gallery each month. The art critic Herbert Read, writing that year, called the National Gallery \"a defiant outpost of culture right in the middle of a bombed and shattered metropolis\".
