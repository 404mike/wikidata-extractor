By December 2003, Volume 1 Issue 2 stated \"Some five hundred copies of our first number were sent gratuitously to the Press, Libraries, Universities and other institutions in the West\" so that the real work of spreading the light to the West is well underway. Metteyya continued to maintain a high level of international contact and by 1904, thanks to the generous supporters in Burma, the periodical was appearing on the reading table of 500 to 600 libraries across Europe.

On the evening of 3 November 1907, a meeting commenced at Harley Street, London.

On this event, fifty years later, Christmas Humphreys stated that Metteyya \"brought Buddhism as a living force to England\" that it was the start of a slow growing movement of \"many to live the Buddhist life\".", "Christmas Humphreys recounts his meeting of Metteyya on this inaugural Mission, in London 1908: with head shaven, the \"then thirty-six years of age\" Bhikkhu was \"tall, slim, graceful, and dignified.\" Humphreys describes Metteyyas deep-set eyes juxtaposed against a slightly ascetic appearance, that surely Metteyya \"made a great impression on all who met him\". The young monk was well-spoken, interesting with conversation and topic, with a pleasant voice, \"and in his lighter moments he showed a delightful sense of humour\". Metteyya displayed a \"deep comprehension of the Dhamma\" and his wit of analogy by topic of science and his sheer \"power and range of thought combined to form a most exceptional personality.\" ", "In this period also the influential Zen Buddhist and prolific populariser, Japanese man Suzuki Daisetsu Teitar\u014d, meet with Metteyya.
