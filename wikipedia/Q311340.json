He managed Southport in the  2017\u201318 season, before his contract was terminated on 30 April 2018.\nDavies originally made his name as a vital part of the Chesterfield team which reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1997. He left Chesterfield at the end of that season, having made 148 appearances for the club and joined Premier League club Southampton in May 1997. He only spent one season at Southampton, making 30 appearances, before he joined Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in a club-record \u00a37.5 million deal. Once again, he spent a single season at the club, making 29 appearances, before rejoining Southampton in 1999. In his second spell at the club, he made 95 appearances, also spending part of 2002 on loan to First Division club Millwall, where he made nine appearances. Released by Southampton at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, he joined Premier League club Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer. He was made Bolton team captain in January 2009, but began to fall out of favour at Bolton towards the end of the 2012\u201313 season, and the club decided against renewing his contract. Davies made 407 appearances for Bolton, scoring 85 goals, then played two seasons at Preston North End before retiring.\nHe made three appearances for the England under-21 team between 1997 and 2000. At the age of 33, Davies made his international debut, and only appearance, for England against Montenegro in a 0\u20130 draw on 12 October 2010, coming on as a second-half substitute.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 26", "response": ["*1977 \u2013 Kevin Davies, English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Kevin Davies \u2013 BT Sport 2013\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Paul Scholes", "response": ["On 11 May 2013, Scholes announced that he would make his second and final retirement from football at the end of the season.

Beattie's initial impact was positive, earning him the club's Player of the Season award as he helped the Saints stave off relegation. His second season was hampered by a series of injuries, but in November 2000 he began a long goalscoring run. After 18 months without a goal, he scored 10 in 10 matches, lifting Southampton into a comfortable position, and securing their place in the Premier League for the next season.

Dean Richards, who was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a38\u00a0million, and Kevin Davies, who was sold to Blackburn Rovers for \u00a37\u00a0million, are good examples. Davies was subsequently bought back by Southampton for a much smaller fee.

Djourou appeared two times in the first two months of the season, and was placed on the substitute bench as a result. Due to Thomas Vermaelen's injury at the beginning of the 2010\u201311 campaign, Djourou received more opportunities to play. Djourou then played a role when he set up two goals, in a 5\u20131 win against Shakhtar Donetsk on 19 October 2010. Wenger admitted that he rotated the Swiss international because he missed an entire year and did not want to lose him. Djourou became Arsenal's first-choice centre-back, playing in all eight games in January 2011, during which time Arsenal conceded no Premier League goals. His performance was praised by the club's captain Cesc F\u00e0bregas. He played in both legs of the semi-finals against Ipswich Town to help Arsenal win 3\u20131 on aggregate to reach the Football League Cup Final. Djourou scored his first goal for Arsenal on 5 February, in the third minute of a 4\u20134 draw against Newcastle United at St. James' Park. He, once again, helped the club's defence keep three consecutive clean sheets between 12 February 2011 and 5 March 2011 against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Stoke City and Sunderland. On 27 February 2011, he started and played the full 90 minutes alongside Laurent Koscielny against Birmingham City in the 2011 Football League Cup Final held at Wembley Stadium in a 2\u20131 defeat. On 12 March 2011, while playing in the quarter finals of the FA Cup away to Manchester United at Old Trafford, Djourou suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder in a collision with teammate Bacary Sagna. Djourou was carried from the field and Wenger later confirmed that he would be unavailable for the remainder of the 2010\u201311 season. This came as a major blow to Arsenal's title challenge, up until then having not lost a Premier League game with him on the field. As well as that Djourou had played a major part in defence in cover of the injured Vermaelen. Djourou recovered more quickly than expected, returning to play the whole of the 1\u20131 draw with Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium on 17 April 2011, playing alongside Koscielny, and the North London Derby three days later. On 24 April 2011, against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium, he conceded a penalty (missed by Kevin Davies) in a 2\u20131 defeat which effectively ended Arsenal's title hopes. At the end of the 2010\u201311 season, he played in a total of 37 matches for the Gunners in all competitions. Local newspaper Islington Gazette gave Djourou's performance 8/10, saying: \"Having missed over a year with a serious knee injury, his return coincided with a defensive shortage and he stepped into the breach admirably, not being on the losing side in the league until late April, when his form did start to fade.

McEveley played regularly for Derby upon their return to the Premiership and scored his first goal for County against Liverpool, the equaliser, in a 2\u20131 home defeat. He sustained knee ligament damage in the 1\u20130 loss to Bolton on 2 January 2008 after a heavy tackle from Kevin Davies which was expected to keep him out for four months, though he returned six weeks later to play in Derby's 2\u20130 defeat away to Wigan Athletic at the end of February 2008."]}, {"page": "Ian Walker (footballer)", "response": ["A cult hero to many of the Foxes fans, Walker had an indifferent season back in the Premier League, producing moments of magic, but unfortunately it all unraveled in a match against Aston Villa at the Walkers Stadium on 31 January 2004, in which he conceded five goals in 18 minutes. Walker put up such a poor display in the match that he was confronted by a Leicester fan who ran onto the pitch, telling him he \"didn't think he was fit to be a Premiership player.\" On 10 February 2004, Walker scored a bizarre own goal in a match against Bolton Wanderers to give them a 1\u20131 draw at Leicester.
