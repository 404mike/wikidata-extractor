They recovered stone artifacts and bones until ordered to stop by George Palao of the Public Works Department. Palao gathered the collected items and arranged for the cave to be sealed according to notes found years later in a vault at the Gibraltar Museum. These finds were rediscovered in a bag in 1991 by Prof. Clive Finlayson, Director of the Gibraltar Museum. They included stone tools, made mainly of red jasper and many mammal bones including the almost complete skull of an ibex, a wild mountain goat. In the bag was Palao's report and thus was able to establish where the finds came from. The stone artifacts were of Mousterian tradition, i.e. Neanderthal.  A museum collaborator, Julio Gafan, was aware of this find and introduced Prof. Finlayson to one of the former workers at the site who agreed to take them to the site where the artifacts had been recovered."]}, {"page": "Bray's Cave", "response": ["Given the lack of data available in southern Iberia in relation to the Bronze Age, the discoveries unearthed at Bray's Cave are of great importance. Previous findings, conducted by George Palao at Judge's Cave, Pete's Paradise Cave and Devil's Fall Cave, excavations carried out by non-specialists, suggested that some of the caves of Gibraltar had had a funerary use."]}, {"page": "Goat's Hair Twin Caves", "response": ["One of these caves was then heavily excavated and emptied of all deposits by the Gibraltar cave research group, led by George Palao in November 1969 and reaching the caves bedrock in June 1970.  During these excavations, there was the discovery of a \"prehistoric ceremonial burial\" on the northern wall of one of the two caves revealing a female human skeleton with a crushed skull surrounded by various pottery vessels, bone pendants, flint blades, armlets and anklets. There are descriptions of this excavation and the findings but there is no record of these finds having ever been deposited in the Gibraltar Museum and therefore there is no trace of this piece of Gibraltar's heritage.Genista Caves, Underground-Gibraltar.com, accessed 8 January 2013"]}, {"page": "Judge's Cave", "response": ["The human remains from this site have been described as being Neolithic and are currently held by the British Museum. This includes the skulls and thigh bones of two individuals. Gibraltarian cave enthusiast George Palao later visited the cave between January and April 1969 in which time he carried out excavations which produced various ceramic artifacts which are now kept at the Gibraltar Museum. The pottery remains excavated by Palao from this site are described as some of Gibraltar's most beautiful pieces."]}, {"page": "Pete's Paradise Cave", "response": ["Pete's Paradise Cave is a cave in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar.  Explored in the 1960s and 1970s by a team led by George Palao, four skeletons have been unearthed in the cave, two of which were female skeletons with crushed skulls.", "Pete\u2019s Paradise is a unique structure with crystal clear rim stone pools and a maze like network of crawls and chambers. This cave was discovered by the Gibraltar Cave Research Group on 26 February 1966 by members who were abseiling down the rock. The cave was named after Peter Mann from the Research Group. (Some people say that it was named after him because his first words when he entered the site were \u201cThis is paradise!\u201d) The Gibraltar Cave Research Group then carried out grade 6 surveys and an excavation of the cave later in 1966 and a Structure and Site plan was produced. During excavation in 1966 numerous prehistoric artefacts were found such as shards of Neolithic pottery, bones and stone tools. Bones were found at different levels and strewn throughout the cave, the majority of these were of rabbit, Ape and Ox mixed with many rodent bones. Chert engraving tools were found along with engraved bone bead (necklace) possibly engraved with one of those stone tools.  A Human burial was also discovered during the excavation. The discovery was made by George Palao in 1966 where four human remains possibly from Neolithic period were found, two female skeletons and two male skeletons.  Unfortunately there is no record of this excavation in the Gibraltar Museum.Pete's Paradise Caves, Underground-Gibraltar.com, accessed 8 January 2013"]}, {"page": "George's Bottom Cave", "response": ["The existence of George's Bottom Cave was suspected on 27 November 1965 when the Gibraltar Cave Research Group found a small hole in the Rock of Gibraltar near Spur Battery,  above sea level. As the group could feel a draught from this hole they suspected it was the entrance to a cave and they arranged to have a large boulder moved to reveal a larger but still small entrance. The cave was named after George Palao of the  Gibraltar Museum. Having entered the cave, visitors find that going is tight which necessitates crawling at some points. Crawling in made no easier by the cave coral which together with the curtains, columns, straws, and helictites create a variety of limestone formations. However, the cave has six different levels which contain a wide variety of formations in numerous chambers and fissures."]}, {"page": "Leonora's Caves", "response": ["Leonora's Caves are a cave system within the popular show cave of St' Michael's Cave and it could be argued that they are an extension of St. Michael's Cave. Leonora's Caves were long believed to be a bottomless pit and it was here where the myth of an underwater cave passage communicating with North Africa emerged. It was said that through this passage, Gibraltar's Barbary macaques made their way to the Rock from Morocco. Leonora's is in fact not a bottomless pit, but is of substantial depth. Graffiti found on stalagmites and columns date back to 1801 and early reports mentioning \"passages leading off St. Michaels Cave\" suggest that the site was first explored in the 1700s by British troops; however, it was only until 1864 that Captain Frederick Brome explored this system extensively and realised its beauty. In 1867, he named this cave after his wife Leonora saying the site was \"of unimaginable beauty\". In 1914, the famous French prehistorian Abbe Breuil visited this cave in an attempt to research it properly and was the first to report seeing spiders, isopods, acaris, staphylindis and diptera. Bats were also reported to have been common in these caves although none are found now. In November 1959 George Palao, a Gibraltarian cave enthusiast and surveyor, head of the Gibraltar Cave Research Group also surveyed this cave producing some fine maps of the system. However, they did miss what is now called Lower Leonora's Cave discovered in 2012 by the Gibraltar Museum Caving Unit. Leonora's Caves just like St. Michael's Cave were used as a show cave in the 19th century. This passage by Lt. Col. G.J. Gilbard said:\"Ladies however need not be afraid of proceeding to the explorations of Leonora's Cave, from where, candles only having been used to light up the stalactites, pillar are undimmed by smoke, and the descent, although a little difficult is not too arduous an undertaking\"."]}, {"page": "Palao", "response": ["*George Palao (1940\u20132009), Gibraltarian historian and illustrator"]}, {"page": "Palao, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Palao"]}]}}
