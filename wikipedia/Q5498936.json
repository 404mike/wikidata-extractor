Mathews or Mathews' Chinese\u2013English Dictionary, edited by the Australian Congregationalist missionary Robert Henry Mathews (1877\u20131970), was the standard Chinese\u2013English dictionary for decades. Mathews originally intended his dictionary to be a revision of Frederick W. Baller's out-of-print An Analytical Chinese\u2013English Dictionary, but ended up compiling a new dictionary. Mathews copied, without acknowledgment, from the two editions of Herbert Giles's A Chinese\u2013English Dictionary.", "In 1928, Mathews was assigned to the China Inland Mission headquarters in Shanghai, where he could fully utilize his printing and Chinese linguistic skills. They commissioned him to revise two out-of-print China Inland Mission publications by Frederick W. Baller, the Analytical Chinese-English Dictionary and Mandarin Primer, both printed in 1900. Robert Mathews and his wife Violet worked intensively to complete the Chinese-English Dictionary in 1931, after only 3 years (he calls it a \"rush job\"), and then, for westerners seeking a \"working knowledge\" of Chinese, the 1938 Kuoy\u00fc Primer in 7 years during the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1943, Japanese occupation troops interned Mathews, commandeered the CIM compound in Shanghai to use as their headquarters, and destroyed both the dictionary printing plates and Mathews' manuscripts and proofs for a revised edition.
