She was the flagship of Admiral Hornby in his passage through the Dardanelles during the Russian war scare of 1878. She ran aground in bad weather at the narrowest part of the strait and was towed off by HMS Sultan in time to lead the squadron to Constantinople. She was present at the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882; in this action the Admiral's flag was shifted to HMS Invincible, as she was of shallower draught and could sail closer to shore.Goodrich, Caspar F (Lt Cdr), Report of the British Naval and Military Operations In Egypt 1882, Navy Department, Washington, 1885, p.26 During this action on 11 July 1882, under command of Captain C. F. Hotham,Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p306 Gunner Israel Harding flung a live 10-inch enemy shell into a tub of water, an action which led to the award of the Victoria Cross. In 1886, the Duke of Edinburgh hoisted his flag on board, and Prince George of Wales, later King George V, joined as a lieutenant. She paid off in 1889 for modernisation."]}, {"page": "Harding (surname)", "response": ["*Israel Harding (1833\u20131917), English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Israel Harding, sailor, was born in Portsmouth"]}]}}
