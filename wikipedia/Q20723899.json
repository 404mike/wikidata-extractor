National titles continued to be won, and in 2007 the club had its last Henley win thus far, with P. Clapp taking the Fawley Challenge Cup in a composite with Henley R.C.. Since the win, junior quads from Maidenhead reached the Fawley semi-finals twice (2013 & 2017) and the final in 2018. In 2015 the club won the Victor Ludorum at the British Junior Rowing Championships. Countless national titles/medals and GB Junior representations decorate many of the club's current and alumni members. In recent years wins at Henley Women's Regatta and the Schools Head of the River were also achieved. Maidenhead has been the starting club for more recently successful athletes such as Rob Williams, who won silver in the LM4- at the London 2012 Olympics, and Jack Beaumont, Rio 2016 Olympic finalist."]}, {"page": "Sam Townsend", "response": ["In 2016 he went to his second Olympic Games competing in the quadruple sculls with Jack Beaumont, Angus Groom and Peter Lambert."]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 2020 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|Harry LeaskAngus GroomTom BarrasJack Beaumont"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Angus GroomPeter LambertSam TownsendJack Beaumont"]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's quadruple sculls", "response": ["|Jack BeaumontSam TownsendAngus GroomPeter Lambert", "|Jack BeaumontSam TownsendAngus GroomPeter Lambert", "|Jack BeaumontSam TownsendAngus GroomPeter Lambert"]}, {"page": "2015 European Rowing Championships", "response": ["|Jack BeaumontSam TownsendGraeme ThomasPeter Lambert || 5:46.89"]}, {"page": "2017 World Rowing Championships", "response": ["| Jack BeaumontJonathan WaltonJohn CollinsGraeme Thomas || 5:45.03"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Walton", "response": ["Walton was born in Leicester and attended Groby Community College and Loughborough University.
