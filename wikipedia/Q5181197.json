He moved to Basingstoke Town towards the end of 2001\u201302, making his debut in March 2002. McAllister spent three seasons there, making 113 appearances, scoring 66 goals before moving up the national league system to Conference National club Stevenage Borough where he made 10 appearances, having loan spells at Gravesend & Northfleet and Eastleigh in 2004\u201305. He joined Woking in 2005, spending two full seasons there, and making over 100 appearances. He had a short spell with Grays Athletic, being sent out on loan to Rushden & Diamonds and then another short spell at Oxford United, all during 2007\u201308. After leaving Oxford in 2008, he took a step up to the Football League for the first time in his career, signing for Exeter City. He went on to score seven goals in his first season, but was loaned out to Barnet and Rotherham United in his second and was eventually released by the club in May 2010. McAllister then dropped back down to non-League football, joining Crawley Town where he played at Old Trafford; his team was defeated 1\u20130 by Manchester United in their FA Cup fifth round tie. He rejected a new contract from Crawley at the end of the 2010\u201311, subsequently joining Newport County.\nMcAllister won his first major honour in 2011, helping Crawley Town win the Conference Premier for the first time in their history. He has also won the Conference South title with Eastleigh in 2014 and the National League South title with Sutton United in 2016.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Woking F.C.", "response": ["* Craig McAllister"]}, {"page": "Gosport Borough F.C.", "response": ["Craig McAllister was appointed as first team manager on 25 June 2018, assisted by Matt Tubbs."]}, {"page": "McAllister (surname)", "response": ["*Craig McAllister (born 1980), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Football Conference", "response": ["|9 ||align=left| Craig McAllister ||align=left| Woking || 15||0||1||1||17"]}, {"page": "Graham Westley", "response": ["As was the case in previous seasons, Westley made wholesale changes at the end of the season, releasing several of the players he had originally signed from Farnborough, and replacing them with a mixture of players with Football League experience \u2013 in the form of Brian Quailey, Dannie Bulman, and Matt Hocking, as well as players from lower divisions such as Jon Nurse and Craig McAllister. Westley also gave first team opportunities to players who had progressed through the club's youth system, which included George Boyd. The new squad lost five games of the opening eight games of the club's league season. Following a 4\u20131 home defeat to  part-time Canvey Island, with Stevenage supporters calling for Westley to leave the club, he walked across the pitch to  the East Terrace and told supporters he \"would turn it around\". The team responded with four consecutive victories, and stayed close to the play-offs places. Stevenage went into the final day of the season needing to beat already-relegated Leigh RMI, and had to rely on Tamworth to hold Morecambe, who were currently occupying the final play-off spot. Stevenage beat Leigh 2\u20130, while Tamworth held Morecambe to a goalless draw, ultimately meaning Westley's team had reached the play-offs on the final day of the season.

A week later he saved what became a crucial penalty against Newport taken by Craig McAllister to earn his side a 0\u20130 draw.

Torquay found it hard to get a foothold in the first half of the game and eventually fell behind in the 39th minute to a Matt Tubbs strike.  However, worse was to follow in the second period when Chris Zebroski was sent off in the 61st minute for a second bookable offence after a handball in the six yard box.  However, when keeper Scott Bevan managed to save the resulting penalty from Tubbs, the Gulls spirits were raised again until another penalty was awarded to Crawley just minutes later.  Astonishingly, Bevan pulled off his second penalty save of the match, this time from Craig McAllister, to give Torquay another lifeline.  Unfortunately, they were unable to capitalise on Bevan's heroics and, despite the sending off of Dean Howell for Crawley in the 83rd minute, the score remained 1\u20130 until the final whistle.  In a match which saw seven bookings in addition to the two dismissals, many Torquay supporters were angered by the tactics employed by Crawley manager Steve Evans (two of Crawley's yellow cards were for time wasting) and their misery was compounded the following day when Evans\u2019 men were rewarded with a trip to Old Trafford to play Manchester United in the Fifth Round draw."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Newport County A.F.C. season", "response": ["County started this season's FA Cup in the 4th qualifying round at home to fellow Conference Premier team Braintree Town.

Stuart Fleetwood scored twice, having been placed into his preferred role as a striker, rather than a winger as he often had under Gary Brabin's management. Andre Gray scored his fourth goal in his first four games, setting a Luton Town record in the process. A 0\u20130 draw with Alfreton Town on 14 April was followed by a 3\u20130 victory over Ebbsfleet United three days later, Fleetwood scoring twice again, and Craig McAllister scoring his first goal of the season. A vital game against fellow play-off candidates Kidderminster Harriers on 21 April went in Luton's favour, as a second-half Robbie Willmott goal secured a 1\u20130 win in front of Kenilworth Road's then-biggest crowd of the season. The result left Luton needing two points from their last two games to ensure a play-off place. This task went down to the final game of the league season after Luton could only manage a 0\u20130 draw with Gateshead in their game-in-hand on 24 April. A win or draw away to free-scoring champions Fleetwood Town would be enough to secure fifth place for the team, while a loss coupled with a Kidderminster win in their own game would see the Harriers take fifth instead.
