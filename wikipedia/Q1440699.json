His clubs included Coventry R.F.C. and Sale.  After retiring, he remained in rugby administration and founded a clothing company. In July 2007, Cotton returned to his former club Sale as a member of the club's board.Cotton was born in Wigan, Lancashire and went to Loughborough University to study physical education.  Cotton was ahead of his time in terms of physical preparation.  It was during these years that Cotton would win the Glengarth Sevens at Davenport Rugby Club (Stockport Rugby Club) along with Steve Smith and Clive Rees.\nCotton made his England debut against Scotland in 1971, and played for them 31 times. He also captained the English team three times.\nHe represented the Lions on their tours to South Africa in 1974, New Zealand in 1977 and South Africa in 1980. It was during the game against the Junior All Blacks on the 1977 tour that the famous 'Mudman' image of Cotton, waiting for the ball at a lineout while caked head-to-toe in mud, was taken. Captured by Colorsport's Colin Elsey, it became one of the most iconic images of rugby union.\nCotton was the Tour Manager for the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa.With Steve Smith he founded the clothing company Cotton Traders in 1987. In 2008 Cotton Traders was forced to pull out of Burma after an investigation by the Burma Campaign UK uncovered the company was sourcing clothing from Burma. Clothing exports generate significant income for the Burmese dictatorship [1].\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 3", "response": ["*1947 \u2013 Fran Cotton, English rugby player"]}, {"page": "Coventry", "response": ["Coventry Rugby Football Club play in the RFU Championship, the second tier of the English rugby union system.

The Lions convincingly won the first test at Newlands 25\u201316 with Neil Jenkins kicking five penalties and Matt Dawson and Alan Tait scoring tries.
