She and her partner, Donnie Burns, were 14-time Professional World Latin Dance Champions and 11 times Professional International Latin American Dance Champions. This is by some way the record number of wins in both these top competitions. On their retirement from competition dancing they were both appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to the performing arts in the 1991 Birthday Honours.Gaynor was introduced to Donnie by another former world champion Sammy Stopford. They were two-time amateur champions before moving to the professional level. Their professional string of wins in the world championship stood at an undefeated streak of 13 years (1984\u20131996) followed by one year of retirement and then another single championship followed by another retirement.\nTo bring the elements of Flamenco dance into their competitive repertoire they went to South America to train with world champion Flamenco dancers. They have traveled extensively to teach in Japan and Hong Kong.\nGaynor is married to Italian dancer Mirko Saccani, with whom she competed after the end of her partnership with Burns. As of 2006, she was living in Hong Kong and training wealthy socialites for Pro-Am competitions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World Latin Dance Champions", "response": ["|rowspan=\"13\"| Donnie Burns & Gaynor Fairweather", "| Donnie Burns & Gaynor Fairweather"]}, {"page": "Donnie Burns", "response": ["He and his former partner Gaynor Fairweather were 14-time World Professional Latin champions: this is by some way the record for this title.
