Rhodes was born in Edinburgh, but spent her infancy and youth in Serampore, India. She moved to the UK in her mid teens and studied fine art at the Glasgow School of Art. Graduating in 1982 she became politically active around issues of disarmament, feminism and social justice. Her focus returned to painting around 1990, and she developed her distinctive idiom of aerial-view, \u2018man-made\u2019 landscapes around 1994. These began to be exhibited in the United Kingdom and internationally, and entered many public collections. Rhodes\u2019s work, and her part-time lecturing at Glasgow School of Art, was influential for younger generations of artists. In 2013 she was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrian Morris", "response": ["In the following years his work was rediscovered and championed by younger generations of artists.
