His recordings include many sets later regarded as classics and reissued by EMI as \"Great Recordings of the Century\". He worked in the recording industry from 1927, combining this with the post of junior music critic of The Manchester Guardian. He was assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and in World War II played a role in bringing music to the armed forces and civilians.\nAfter the war, Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra and worked for EMI as a recording producer. In the 1960s, he quarrelled with EMI and resigned. He attempted to disband the Philharmonia in 1964, but it continued as an independent body without him. After this he had no permanent job, and confined himself to giving masterclasses with, and supervising the recordings of, his second wife, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maria Callas", "response": ["Callas's voice was and remains controversial; it bothered and disturbed as many as it thrilled and inspired. Walter Legge stated that Callas possessed that most essential ingredient for a great singer: an instantly recognizable voice.", "Callas's voice was noted for its three distinct registers: Her low or chest register was extremely dark and powerful, and she used this part of her voice for dramatic effect, often going into this register much higher on the scale than most sopranos. Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound\u2014\"part oboe, part clarinet\", as Claudia Cassidy described it\u2014and was noted for its veiled or \"bottled\" sound, as if she were singing into a jug. Walter Legge, husband of diva Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, attributed this sound to the \"extraordinary formation of her upper palate, shaped like a Gothic arch, not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth\".", "Callas's vocal registers, however, were not seamlessly joined; Walter Legge writes, \"Unfortunately, it was only in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill.\" Rodolfo Celletti states,", "Though adored by many opera enthusiasts, Callas was a controversial artist. While Callas was the great singer often dismissed simply as an actress she considered herself foremost a musician, that is, the first instrument of the orchestra.\" Grace Bumbry has stated, \"If I followed the musical score when she was singing, I would see every tempo marking, every dynamic marking, everything being adhered to, and at the same time, it was not antiseptic; it was something that was very beautiful and moving.\"Maria Callas\u00a0\u2013 Living and Dying for Art and Love, TDK DVD Video, Released March 22, 2005 Victor de Sabata confided to Walter Legge , \"If the public could understand, as we do, how deeply and utterly musical Callas is, they would be stunned\", and Serafin assessed Callas's musicality as \"extraordinary, almost frightening.\"Serafin, Tullio, \"A triptych of Singers,\" Opera Annual, No. 8, 1962 Callas possessed an innate architectural sense of line-proportion and an uncanny feel for timing and for what one of her colleagues described as \"a sense of the rhythm within the rhythm\".", "In addition to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language and the use of language in music. In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes, \"If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text.\" Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states, \"What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something\u2014it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art.\" Walter Legge states that,", "In recordings from 1954 (immediately after her 80-pound weight loss) and thereafter, \"not only would the instrument lose its warmth and become thin and acidulous, but the altitudinous passages would to her no longer come easily.\" It was at this time that unsteady top notes first begin to appear. Walter Legge, who produced nearly all of Callas's EMI/Angel recordings, states that Callas \"ran into a patch of vocal difficulties as early as 1954\": during the recording of La forza del destino, done immediately after the weight loss, the \"wobble had become so pronounced\" that he told Callas they \"would have to give away seasickness pills with every side\".", "Whether Callas's vocal decline was due to ill health, early menopause, over-use and abuse of her voice, loss of breath-support, loss of confidence, or weight loss will continue to be debated. Whatever the cause may have been, her singing career was effectively over by age 40, and even at the time of her death at age 53, according to Walter Legge, \"she ought still to have been singing magnificently\"."]}, {"page": "William Walton", "response": ["From the days of 78\u00a0rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies.
