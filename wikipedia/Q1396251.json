Like his two previous records, it was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and featured Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars \u2013 comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. Also in the lineup was American pianist Mike Garson, who was hired by Bowie at the suggestion of RCA executive Ken Glancey and singer-songwriter Annette Peacock. The pianist came from a jazz and blues background, which Pegg believes veered the album from pure rock 'n' roll and expanded Bowie's experimental horizons. Buckley called Aladdin Sane the beginning of Bowie's \"experimental phase\" and cited Garson's presence as \"revolutionary\". Scott noted that Garson added elements to the arrangements that were not there before, including more keyboards and synthesisers. Garson later said that Scott as producer \"got the best piano sound out of any of his performances for Bowie.\" Garson remembered being given a lot of attention from Bowie in the studio, who mainly wanted to see what Garson could do. He remained with Bowie's entourage for the next three years. Along with Garson, others added to the lineup for the album and tour included saxophonists Ken Fordham and Brian \"Bux\" Wilshaw and backing vocalists Juanita Franklin, Linda Lewis and longtime friend Geoffrey MacCormack (later known as Warren Peace); MacCormack would subsequently appear on numerous records by Bowie throughout the remainder of the 1970s.", "*Linda Lewis\u00a0\u2013 backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Blondes Have More Fun", "response": ["*Linda Lewis \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Terry Reid", "response": ["* Glastonbury Fayre (1972) Directed by Nicolas Roeg features \"Dean\", an extended jam with Linda Lewis).
