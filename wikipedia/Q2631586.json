[...] while it's sustained with considerable energy by the actors and direction you have to doubt whether it really stands up for one episode, let alone four.\" Conversely, a retrospective review in The Guardian highlighted the series as \"a gem from an era when the BBC took its black comedy seriously\", praising both its dark content and humour, \"a Richard Briers sitcom that's the opposite of The Good Life.\" The series was only broadcast once and never repeated; according to The Guardian  ...\"possibly because it was too much of a leap for fans of The Good Life, but it has grown in cult status over the years.\""]}, {"page": "Goodbye, Mr. Chips", "response": ["A television film adaptation was produced by STV Studios (then known as \"SMG TV Productions\") in 2002.

His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something.

Burbage promises the payment the next day, so Marlowe refuses to part with the pages and departs for Deptford, where he is killed.
