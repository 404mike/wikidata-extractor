Herbert served as director of postal and telegraph censorship for the Ministry of Information during the Second World War. He was elected President of the Law Society in 1956.Knighted in 1943, Herbert was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1956 Birthday Honours. He was created a life peer as Baron Tangley, of Blackheath in the County of Surrey on 22 January 1964.  This was in recognition of his work on the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. The area that was to become what is now known as Greater London was controlled by the London, Surrey, Essex, Kent and Middlesex County Councils and a number of County Boroughs. The result was that the London and Middlesex County Councils and County Boroughs disappeared, and the areas covered by Essex and Surrey were reduced.\nThe Greater London Council was established as the strategic authority, with broad town planning and transport powers; below it were the City of London, basically covering the area it had always controlled, and thirty two new London Boroughs. They provided local town planning powers, local highways and inter alia social and housing powers. The GLC took over running the council housing that the London County Council had controlled.\nHerbert introduced Thomas Graham Brown to Frank Smythe in 1927. Herbert and Brown later climbed the Brenva face of  Mont Blanc. Herbert was President of the Alpine Club from 1953 to 1956.\nHerbert married Gwendoline Judd in 1932; they had a son and three daughters. His eldest daughter, Dr Hon. Elizabeth Ann Herbert, M.A. B.Ch., married Michael Cottrell Brain, 3rd Baron Brain, in 1960.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edwin Savory Herbert", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edwin Herbert, Baron Tangley"]}, {"page": "Edwin Herbert", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edwin Herbert, Baron Tangley"]}, {"page": "Baron Tangley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edwin Herbert, Baron Tangley"]}, {"page": "Lord Tangley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edwin Herbert, Baron Tangley"]}, {"page": "Sir Edwin S.
