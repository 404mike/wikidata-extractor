His claim (which he attributes to Charles Sanders Peirce and John Buridan) is that every statement includes an implicit assertion of its own truth. Thus, for example, the statement \"It is true that two plus two equals four\" contains no more information than the statement \"two plus two equals four\", because the phrase \"it is true that...\" is always implicitly there. And in the self-referential spirit of the Liar Paradox, the phrase \"it is true that...\" is equivalent to \"this whole statement is true and ...\".", "This is an equation from which the truth value of A = \"this statement is false\" could hopefully be obtained. In the boolean domain \"A = false\" is equivalent to \"not A\" and therefore the equation is not solvable. This is the motivation for reinterpretation of A. The simplest logical approach to make the equation solvable is the dialetheistic approach, in which case the solution is A being both \"true\" and \"false\". Other resolutions mostly include some modifications of the equation; Arthur Prior claims that the equation should be \"A = 'A = false and A = true and therefore A is false. In computational verb logic, the liar paradox is extended to statements like, \"I hear what he says; he says what I don't hear\", where verb logic must be used to resolve the paradox."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Arthur Prior"]}, {"page": "University of Canterbury", "response": ["* Arthur Prior \u2013 philosopher"]}, {"page": "History of logic", "response": ["This was also a period, particularly in the 1950s and afterwards, when the ideas of mathematical logic begin to influence philosophical thinking.  For example, tense logic is a formalised system for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time. The philosopher Arthur Prior played a significant role in its development in the 1960s. Modal logics extend the scope of formal logic to include the elements of modality (for example, possibility and necessity). The ideas of Saul Kripke, particularly about possible worlds, and the formal system now called Kripke semantics have had a profound impact on analytic philosophy.Jerry Fodor, \"Water's water everywhere\", London Review of Books, 21 October 2004 His best known and most influential work is Naming and Necessity (1980).See Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century: Volume 2: The Age of Meaning, Scott Soames: \"Naming and Necessity is among the most important works ever, ranking with the classical work of Frege in the late nineteenth century, and of Russell, Tarski and Wittgenstein in the first half of the twentieth century\".

Although Arthur Prior is widely known as a founder of temporal logic, the first formalization of such logic was provided in 1947 by Polish logician, Jerzy \u0141o\u015b. In his work Podstawy Analizy Metodologicznej Kanon\u00f3w Milla (The Foundations of a Methodological Analysis of Mill\u2019s Methods) he presented a formalization of Mill's canons. In \u0141o\u015b.' approach emphasis was placed on the time factor. Thus, to reach his goal, he had to create a logic which could provide means for formalization of temporal functions. The logic could be seen as a byproduct of \u0141o\u015b' main aim, albeit it was the first positional logic which, as a framework was used later for \u0141o\u015b' inventions in epistemic logic. The logic itself has syntax very different than Prior's tense logic, which uses modal operators. Language of \u0141o\u015b' logic rather uses a specific for positional logic, realization operator that binds the expression with the specific context in which its truth-value is considered. In \u0141o\u015b' work this considered context was only temporal, thus expressions were binded with specific moments or intervals of time.", "In the following years, research of temporal logic by Arthur Prior began. He was concerned with the philosophical implications of free will and predestination. According to his wife, he first considered formalizing temporal logic in 1953. Results of his research were firstly presented at the conference in Wellington in 1954. The system Prior presented, was similar syntactically to \u0141o\u015b' logic, although not until 1955 he explicitly referred to \u0141o\u015b' work, in last section of Appendix 1 in Prior\u2019s Formal Logic."]}, {"page": "Term logic", "response": ["* Arthur Prior"]}, {"page": "Modal logic", "response": ["While the intuition behind modal logic date back to antiquity, the first modal axiomatic systems were developed by C.
