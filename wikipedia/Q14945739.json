He is one of the top three Hamlets I have seen, for a simple reason: he is Hamlet\".Vanity Fair Volume 58, 1995."]}, {"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["In 1935 the Sellers family moved to North London and settled in Muswell Hill. Although Bill Sellers was Protestant and Peg was Jewish, Sellers attended the North London Roman Catholic school St Aloysius' College, run by the Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy. The family was not rich, but Peg insisted on an expensive private schooling for her son. According to biographer Peter Evans, Sellers was fascinated, puzzled, and worried by religion from a young age, particularly Catholicism; Roger Lewis believed that soon after entering Catholic school, Sellers \"discovered he was a Jew\u2014he was someone on the outside of the mysteries of faith\". Later in his life, Sellers observed that while his father's faith was according to the Church of England, his mother was Jewish, \"and Jews take the faith of their mother.\" According to Milligan, Sellers held a guilt complex about being Jewish and recalls that Sellers was once reduced to tears when he presented him with a candlestick from a synagogue for Christmas, believing the gesture to be an anti-Jewish slur. Sellers became a top student at the school, excelling in drawing in particular. He was prone to laziness, but his natural talents shielded him from criticism by his teachers. Sellers recalled that a teacher scolded the other boys for not studying, saying: \"The Jewish boy knows his catechism better than the rest of you!\"", "Sellers's difficulties in getting his film career to take off, and increasing problems in his personal life, prompted him to seek periodic consultations with astrologer Maurice Woodruff, who held considerable sway over his later career. After a chance meeting with a North American Indian spirit guide in the 1950s, Sellers became convinced that the music hall comedian Dan Leno, who died in 1904, haunted him and guided his career and life-decisions.  Sellers was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats, the same exclusive theatrical fraternity founded by Leno in 1890. In 1958 Sellers starred with David Tomlinson, Wilfrid Hyde-White, David Lodge and Lionel Jeffries as a chief petty officer in Val Guest's Up the Creek. Guest later claimed that he had written and directed the film as a vehicle for Sellers, and thus had started Sellers's film career. To practise his voice, Sellers purchased a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The film received critical acclaim in the United States and Roger Lewis viewed it as an important practice ground for Sellers. Next, Sellers featured with Terry-Thomas as one of a pair of comic villains in George Pal's Tom Thumb (1958), a musical fantasy film, opposite Russ Tamblyn, Jessie Matthews and Peter Butterworth. Terry-Thomas later said that \"my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it\". The performance was a landmark in Sellers's career and became his first contact with the Hollywood film industry.", "In 1960 Sellers portrayed an Indian doctor, Dr Ahmed el Kabir, in Anthony Asquith's romantic comedy The Millionairess, a film based on a George Bernard Shaw play of the same name. Sellers was not interested in the role until he learned that Sophia Loren would be his co-star. When asked about Loren, he explained to reporters, \"I don't normally act with romantic, glamorous women\u00a0... She's a lot different from Harry Secombe.\" Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming, culminating in Sellers declaring his love for her in front of his wife. Sellers also woke his son at night to ask: \"Do you think I should divorce your mummy?\" There is uncertainty if the relationship was anything more than platonic: a number of people, including Spike Milligan, consider it an affair, while others, including Graham Stark, think it remained only a strong friendship. Sellers's wife at the time, Anne, afterwards commented, \"I don't know to this day whether he had an affair with her. Nobody does.\" Roger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions, that \"He'd play a role as an Indian doctor, and for the next six months, he'd be an Indian in his real [daily] life.\" The film inspired the George Martin-produced novelty hit single \"Goodness Gracious Me\", with Sellers and Loren, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart in November 1960. A follow-up single by the duo, \"Bangers and Mash\", reached number 22 in the UK chart. The songs were included on an album released by the couple, Peter & Sophia, which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart. That year he also appeared in Never Let Go (1960) playing a straight villain part.", "Sellers's first film appearance of 1968 was a reunion with Blake Edwards for the fish-out-of-water comedy The Party, in which he starred alongside Claudine Longet and Denny Miller. He appears as Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party. His character, according to Sellers's biographer Peter Evans, was \"clearly an amalgam of Clouseau and the doctor in The Millionairess\". Roger Lewis notes that like a number of Sellers's characters, he is played in a sympathetic and dignified manner. He followed it later that year with Hy Averback's I Love You, Alice B. Toklas, playing an attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a hippie. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars, remarking that Sellers was \"back doing what he does best\", although he also said that in Sellers's previous films he had \"been at his worst recently\".", "In March 1976 Sellers began dating actress Lynne Frederick, whom he married on 18 February 1977. Biographer Roger Lewis documents that of all of Sellers's wives, Frederick was the most poorly treated; Julian Upton likened it to a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight, a relationship that \"oscillated from ardour to hatred, reconciliation and remorse.\" On 20 March 1977, Sellers suffered a second major heart attack during a flight from Paris to London; he was subsequently fitted with a pacemaker. Sellers returned from his illness to undertake Revenge of the Pink Panther; although it was a commercial success, the critics were tiring of Inspector Clouseau. Julian Upton expressed the view that the strain behind the scenes began to manifest itself in the sluggish pace of the film, describing it as a \"laboured, stunt-heavy hotchpotch of half-baked ideas and rehashed gags\". Sellers too had become tired of the role, saying after production, \"I've honestly had enough of Clouseau\u2014I've got nothing more to give\". Steven Bach, the senior vice-president and head of worldwide productions for United Artists, who worked with Sellers on Revenge of the Pink Panther, considered that Sellers was \"deeply unbalanced, if not committable: that was the source of his genius and his truly quite terrifying aspects as manipulator and hysteric.\" He refused to seek professional help for his mental issues.", "The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998, three years after the release of the biography by Roger Lewis, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.  In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's \"life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women\"."]}, {"page": "Anthony Burgess", "response": ["The depth of Burgess's multilingual proficiency came under discussion in Roger Lewis's 2002 biography.

Even Roger Lewis, who was blunt about his disdain for Frederick, admitted that \"of all of Sellers's wives, Lynne Frederick was the most poorly treated\". One of the first people to advocate for Lynne was American author, Ed Sikov, in the 2002 book, Mr. Strangelove: A Biography of Peter Sellers: \"Lynne Frederick deserves a bit of compassion herself in retrospect.
