He initially trained as a butcher, before being called up to the army and stationed in West Africa during World War II. He bought himself out of the army for \u00a365, and returned to England to sign as an amateur for Bristol Rovers. He turned professional with the club in 1948, and had a thirteen-year-long career with them, making 340 league appearances and scoring four goals during that spell. He moved to Trowbridge Town in 1961, where he stayed for two years before taking over as assistant manager of his former youth club, Oldland.\nAway from football, Sampson had run a poultry business with his Bristol Rovers teammate Vic Lambden while playing in Bristol, and after his retirement from the sport he worked as a gardener and a milkman in his adopted home town of Cadbury Heath.\nTowards the end of his life he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and spent his last few years living at a nursing home in Congresbury near Bristol. He died on 16 May 2009, aged 81.He was the cousin of former Chelsea player Les Stubbs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Wakering", "response": ["*Peter Sampson - footballer for Bristol Rovers F.C."]}, {"page": "Trowbridge Town F.C.", "response": ["*Peter Sampson"]}, {"page": "2009 in association football", "response": ["* 16 May \u2013 Peter Sampson, English footballer (81)"]}, {"page": "Ricardo van den Bos", "response": ["| 2005-05-22 || Win ||align=left| Peter Sampson || Knees Of Fury 10, Quarter Finals || Australia || TKO || 1 || "]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 in English football", "response": ["*16 May 2009 \u2013 Peter Sampson, 81, former wing-half who made 340 league appearances for Bristol Rovers, his only professional club, between 1948 and 1961."]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2009", "response": ["*Peter Sampson, 81, British footballer (Bristol Rovers), Alzheimer's disease."]}, {"page": "Sampson, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Sampson"]}]}}
