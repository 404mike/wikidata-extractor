One of the most famous pedestrians of that period was Captain Robert Barclay Allardice, known as \"The Celebrated Pedestrian\", of Stonehaven in Scotland. His most impressive feat was to walk  every hour for 1000 hours, which he achieved between 1 June and 12 July 1809. This feat captured many people's imagination, and around 10,000 people came to watch over the course of the event. During the rest of the 19th century, many people tried to repeat this feat, including Ada Anderson who developed it further and walked a half-mile (800\u00a0m) each quarter-hour over the 1,000 hours."]}, {"page": "Pedestrianism", "response": ["One of the most famous pedestrians of the day was Captain Robert Barclay Allardice, called \"The Celebrated Pedestrian\", of Stonehaven.\"Pedestrianism\" by Matthew Algeo, Chicago Review Press, Chicago, 2014 His most impressive feat was to walk  every hour for 1000 hours, which he achieved between 1 June and 12 July 1809.

Headline Review, New Ed, (2002)  During the 19th century, attempts to repeat the athletic challenge were made by many pedestrians, including George Wilson who attempted to walk  in 480 hours in 1815 but was arrested after 3/4 of the distance for disturbing the peace. Emma Sharp was thought to be the first woman to complete the challenge of  in 1000 hours on 29 October 1864. Later racewalkers proved to be more successful, especially Ada Anderson, who after walking  in 1000 hours was labelled by the press 'Champion Lady Walker of the World', a feat only equalled by one other, her trainer William Gale.", "* Ada Anderson"]}]}}
