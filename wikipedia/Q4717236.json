It was released on 27 August 2001 by Polydor Records. After the disbandment of the Britpop group Theaudience, in which Ellis-Bextor served as vocalist, she was signed to Polydor. Prior to the LP's completion, the singer collaborated with several musicians, including band Blur's bassist Alex James, Moby and New Radicals frontman Gregg Alexander. The record was described as a collection of 1980s electronica and 1970s disco music.", "Following the disbandment of Britpop group Theaudience, Ellis-Bextor provided vocals for the song \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" by Italian DJ Spiller. The song was a commercial success, and Ellis-Bextor signed to Polydor. She was contacted by director Baz Luhrmann, who offered her a role in the 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, but the singer refused in order to focus on her career as a recording artist. The success of \"Groovejet\" also prompted American musician Moby to notice Ellis-Bextor, and revealed interest in working with her due to her \"amazing\" voice, as he described it. He instructed his record company to \"track\" Ellis-Bextor \"down\" so they could start working as soon as Moby finished his tour. The two ultimately wrote five songs in New York City, which did not make the final cut of Read My Lips. Furthermore, she also recorded with Blur bassist Alex James, as well as former frontman of the New Radicals, Gregg Alexander, while Damian LeGassick was recruited for his programming and keyboard work.", "An \"eclectic\" album, Read My Lips, is a collection of 1980s electronica and 1970s disco. The album opener and first single is a cover version of Cher's 1979 song \"Take Me Home\", described as a \"disco groove\". Betty Clarke from The Guardian observed that her voice in the song is reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn's Eliza Doolittle (in the movie My Fair Lady). \"Move This Mountain\", co-written by Alex James, is a \"vibrant\" ballad with a trip hop-influenced sound. Following track and second single, \"Murder on the Dancefloor\", is a dance-pop and disco record, that utilises bass guitar and piano in its instrumental. \"Sparkle\" has \"speeding beats and equally speeding keyboards\", while \"Final Move\" contains \"tinny beats\" and \"electro swirls\". The latter was deemed a \"subdued version\" of \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" with \"similar kaleidoscope synth\". \"I Believe\" was described as \"funky\" and \"live-sounding\", while \"Leave the Others Alone\" involves \"cold beats\" and \"big, full-throttle keyboards\". \"By Chance\" was particularly noted for showcasing Ellis-Bextor's accent. Re-release new song \"Get Over You\" is a \"polite\" Euro disco take on \"I Will Survive\".", "*Alex James \u2013 producer, bass guitar, guitars"]}, {"page": "Alex James", "response": ["Alex James may refer to:", "*Alex James (musician) (born 1968), bassist in English band Blur, newspaper columnist and cheesemaker", "*Alex James (songwriter) (born 1976), songwriter, producer and music publisher", "*Alex James (footballer) (1901\u20131953), Scottish footballer with Arsenal F.C.", "*Alex James (mathematician), British and New Zealand mathematician and mathematical biologist", "*Alex James (boxer), boxer from Grenada; see Boxing at the 1990 Central American and Caribbean Games"]}, {"page": "James (surname)", "response": ["* Alex James (footballer) (1901\u20131953), Scottish soccer player", "* Alex James (musician) (born 1968), English musician and journalist, member of band Blur", "* Alex James (songwriter) (born 1976), songwriter and producer"]}, {"page": "Shimmy (song)", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Alex James (songwriter)"]}, {"page": "Ready for Love (album)", "response": ["The title track, which had been airing for a couple of weeks, \"feels cool and energetic like in the '60s\", Tata says, saying she learned the \"big voice\" techniques of American R&B singers Aretha Franklin, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jennifer Hudson. \"My Bloody Valentine,\" written by Alex James (Alexandra Burke, Charice, Adam Lambert) and Busbee (Toni Braxton, Jonas Brothers, Alexandra Burke) was released as a follow-up single. \"Mission is You\" and \"Shine Like a Superstar\" are Silom Soi 2-style rousers. \"Burning Out\" and \"Suffocate\" get melancholic. \"Ugly\" is a return to the catchy form of \"Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy\" and \"Love is the Law\" sounds like Madonna's \"Rain\".
