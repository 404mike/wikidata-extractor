He was the brother of mathematician Robin Bullough (d. 2008).\nBullough was educated at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School, then went up to St John's College, Oxford where he took a first in History in 1950. He held a Harmsworth Senior Scholarship at Merton College from 1951 to 1952, and a Fereday Fellowship at St John's between 1952 and 1955.Bullough was made a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 1958, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland the following year.Bullough was successively Lecturer in Medieval History at the University of Edinburgh (1955-1966), Professor of Medieval History at the University of Nottingham (1966-1973) and Professor of Medieval History and Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the University of St Andrews (1973-1991). He was made Corresponding Fellow of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica in 1983.\nA collection of essays under the title Early Medieval Rome and the Christian West: Essays in Honour of Donald A. Bullough, edited by Julia Smith, was published in 2000.\nBullough was married twice: firstly in 1963 to Belinda Jane Turland, they had two daughters, their marriage was dissolved in 1994; secondly in 1995 to Dr Alice Harting-Correa.Bullough died of cancer on 26 June 2002. In honour of his academic achievements, the Institute of Mediaeval Studies at the University of St Andrews created the Donald Bullough Fellowship For A Mediaeval Historian.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alcuin", "response": ["In his Life of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils, called a paterfamilias, had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the Humber, which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing paterfamilias (\"head of a family, householder\") usually referred to a  (\"churl\"), Donald A. Bullough suggests that Alcuin's family was of  (\"churlish\") status: i.e., free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy. If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as Deira.", "Alcuin transmitted to the Franks the knowledge of Latin culture, which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of Venantius Fortunatus, he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae. At the same time, he is noted for making one of the only explicit comments on Old English poetry surviving from the early Middle Ages, in a letter to one Speratus, the bishop of an unnamed English see (possibly Unwona of Leicester):  (\"Let God's words be read at the episcopal dinner-table. It is right that a reader should be heard, not a harpist, patristic discourse, not pagan song. What has Hinield to do with Christ?\").Donald A.

According to Donald A. Bullough, they also offer a window on the kind of social bonds which could be created by \"neighbourhood\". In the 10th century, the Bishop of Worcester leased out various small estates attached to the Church in the three counties (Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire) to several high-ranking men and women, usually for three lifespans.Bullough Friends, Neighbours and Fellow-drinkers pp. 19\u201321 The pattern may be taken to suggest that this way of association served to \"create a network, an inter-meshing, of high-status 'neighbours' ... with its central knot in Worcester and the domus of the bishop\". In the bishop's residence or at home, the lessees may have come together to participate in convivial drinking, just as the Norman successors to these lands are envisaged as doing in William of Malmesbury's Life of St Wulfstan.Bullough Friends, Neighbours and Fellow-drinkers pp. 21\u201322 Further, some of the thegns served in the royal army (fyrd) under the command of Bishop Oswald or his successors, which presupposes the creation of a personal warband and possibly one with the secondary purpose of protecting the bishop's properties.Bullough Friends, Neighbours and Fellow-drinkers p. 22"]}, {"page": "Germanus of Winchester", "response": ["Although Germanus's name is not Anglo-Saxon, Byrhtferth, a contemporary who wrote the Vita Oswaldi, which contains much information on Germanus, states that he was a native of Winchester. Germanus accompanied Oscytel, the Archbishop of York, and Oswald of Worcester, on their trip to Rome in about 957, purportedly to collect Oscytel's pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority. This journey, however, has been challenged by the historian Donald A. Bullough, who argues that no previous archbishops of York had collected their palliums in person. He also points out that this story is only related in the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis, the chronicle of the Ramsey Abbey.Bullough \"St Oswald\" St Oswald of Worcester p. 8 According to the Ramsey story, Oscytel and Oswald returned to England, but Germanus remained on the continent and became a monk at Fleury Abbey in France.Lapidge \"Germanus\" Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England pp. 202\u2013203 Another story has Oswald journeying to Fleury on his own, with Germanus arriving at Fleury after Oswald had been resident at Fleury for a number of years prior to 958.Nightingale \"Oswald, Fleury and continental reform\" St Oswald of Worcester p. 24"]}, {"page": "Pacificus of Verona", "response": ["While La Rocca has raised a number of questions about the veracity of the claims surrounding Pacificus of Verona, her arguments are not entirely accepted among medieval scholars. Some scholars accept the conclusions she has reached, such as Nicholas Everett, who in his 2003 book Literacy in Lombard Italy describes \"... the more famous examples of marginalia attributed to Bishop Pacificus [sic] and his schola sacerdotum, both of which appear to belong more to the realm of myth than history.\"Nicholas Everett, Literacy in Lombard Italy, c. 568-774, (Cambridge: Cambridge Press, 2003), 287.  However there are also those who do not accept her version of Pacificus' history, such as the late Donald A. Bullough, who in his 2004 book Alcuin, Achievement and Reputation, stated \"The elaborate attempt by C. La Rocca ... to impugn the authenticity of the epitaphs and their evidence for Pacificus' life and career has not persuaded me or others.\" Specialists of Carolingian poetry, such as Gabriel Silagi, Gian Paolo Marchi, Grazia Di Pasquale, Francesco Stella disputed some aspects of La Rocca's reconstruction and called attention to the poetical, exegetical and epistolary works of Pacificus which have been overlooked in La Rocca's volume.Donald A Bullough, Alcuin, Achievement and Reputation: Being part of the Ford lectures delivered in Oxford in Hilary Term 1980, (Leiden: Koninklijke Brill NV, 2004), 308-309, n180; Di Pasquale 1997, Marchi 2002 e Silagi 1996"]}, {"page": "Donald Bullough", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donald A.
