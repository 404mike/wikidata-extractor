His views on Aristotle also led to an attack by Thomas White, the Catholic priest known as Blacklo. In A Praefatory Answer to Mr. Henry Stubbe (1671) he defined the \"philosophy of the virtuosi\" cleanly: the \"plain objects of sense\" to be respected, as the locus of as much certainty as was available; the \"suspension of assent\" absent adequate proof; and the claim for the approach as \"equally an adversary to scepticism and credulity\".

He himself was a teacher to Johan de Witt and a teacher and friend of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Beeckman had met the young Descartes in November 1618 in Breda, where Beeckman then lived and Descartes was then garrisoned as a soldier. It is said that they met when both were looking at a placard that was set up in the Breda marketplace, detailing a mathematical problem to be solved. Descartes asked Beeckman to translate the problem from Dutch to French.Stephen Gaukroger. Descartes: An Intellectual Biography. Oxford University Press, 1995, Chapter 3. In their following meetings Beeckman interested Descartes in his corpuscularian approach to mechanical theory, and convinced him to devote his studies to a mathematical approach to nature. In 1619, Descartes dedicated one of his first tractati to him, the Compendium Musicae. When Descartes returned to  the Dutch Republic in the autumn of 1628, Beeckman also introduced him to many of Galileo's ideas. In 1629 they fell out over a dispute concerning whether Beeckman had helped Descartes with some of his mathematical discoveries. In October 1630, Descartes wrote a long and harshly abusive letter, apparently meant to crush Beeckman psychologically, in which he declared himself never to have been influenced by Beeckman. However, and despite a few other such fallings-out, they remained in contact until Beeckman's death in 1637."]}, {"page": "Breda", "response": ["* Although neither of them were long-term residents of Breda, it was there, in 1618, that the young Ren\u00e9 Descartes (at the time, a soldier in the army of Prince Maurice of Nassau) first met, and had extensive conversations with, Dutch philosopher, mathematician, and scientist Isaac Beeckman (then temporarily resident in the town). This interaction with Beeckman seems to have changed the course of Descartes\u2019 intellectual life, eventually leading him to the major innovations in mathematics, science, and philosophy for which he is famous.Stephen Gaukroger.

Wallis defended himself, and re-confronted Hobbes with his mathematical inconsistencies. Hobbes responded with Marks of the Absurd Geometry, Rural Language, Scottish Church Politics, and Barbarisms of John Wallis, Professor of Geometry and Doctor of Divinity. It has been suggested that Hobbes was still trying to cultivate John Owen at this point: Owen was both the leading Independent theologian and Cromwell's choice as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, and Hobbes softened his critical line on the universities while stoking up the quarrel with Wallis. Further, the religious dimension (Scottish Church Politics refers to the Presbyterianism of Wallis, not shared by Owen) has been seen as a presage of later analysis of Behemoth, the book Hobbes wrote in 1668 as a post-mortem on the English Revolution.R.

In 1690, Pierre Bayle asserted that religion \"is neither necessary nor sufficient for morality\". Modern sources separate the two concepts. For example, The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics says that, For many religious people, morality and religion are the same or inseparable; for them either morality is part of religion or their religion is their morality. For others, especially for nonreligious people, morality and religion are distinct and separable; religion may be immoral or nonmoral, and morality may or should be nonreligious. Even for some religious people the two are different and separable; they may hold that religion should be moral and morality should be, but they agree that they may not be."]}, {"page": "Jacques Dinet", "response": ["He knew Descartes from La Fl\u00e8che, where for some of the time he supervised Descartes's studies as principal prefect.

A letter to Dinet in 1642 attacked both Bourdin and Gisbertus Voetius, an opponent at the University of Utrecht. The letter also set out his position in relation to scholastic philosophy.
