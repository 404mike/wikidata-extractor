He played at representative level for Great Britain (non-Test matches), and at club level for Featherstone Rovers (Heritage No. 396) (captain), and Wakefield Trinity (Heritage No. 725), as an occasional goal-kicking fullback, or centre, i.e. number 1, or, 3 or 5, and coached at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Assistant Coach to Neil Fox), and York (Initially Assistant Coach to Tommy Harris, then Head coach).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wakefield Trinity", "response": ["Despite winning the Challenge Cup for a fifth time in 1963, Wakefield had still not been able to secure the league championship title. The Holy Grail would be achieved in the 1966\u201367 season when the experienced Harold Poynton led a powerful side, which included Neil Fox, Don Fox, Gary Cooper and Ray Owen, to victory over St. Helens in a replay of the championship final. They repeated the title feat the following year against Hull Kingston Rovers but were again denied the double when Leeds defeated them in the 1968 'water splash' final at Wembley, a match played during a downpour that saturated the pitch. The game produced the most dramatic of finishes, when Man-of-the-Match, Don Fox had an under-the-posts conversion to win it for Wakefield, but \"topped it\" on the saturated turf and missed, to leave Leeds 11\u201310 winners.", "Trinity were crowned Champions for the only time in successive seasons \u2013 1966\u201367 and 1967\u201368.
