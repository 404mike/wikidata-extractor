Manchester was credited as the main driving force behind British indie music of the 1980s led by The Smiths, later including The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, and James. The later groups came from what became known as the \"Madchester\" scene that also centred on The Ha\u00e7ienda nightclub developed by the founder of Factory Records, Tony Wilson. Although from southern England, The Chemical Brothers subsequently formed in Manchester. Former Smiths frontman Morrissey, whose lyrics often refer to Manchester locations and culture, later found international success as a solo artist. Previously, notable Manchester acts of the 1960s include The Hollies, Herman's Hermits, and Davy Jones of the Monkees (famed in the mid-1960s for their albums and their American TV show), and the earlier Bee Gees, who grew up in Chorlton. Another notable contemporary band from near Manchester is The Courteeners consisting of Liam Fray and four close friends.  Singer-songwriter Ren Harvieu is also from Greater Manchester."]}, {"page": "Mark Owen", "response": ["In March 2013, further details of the album emerged, including the album title, The Art of Doing Nothing.
