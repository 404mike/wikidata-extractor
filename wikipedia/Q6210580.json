The death of Mr. Joe Jones three weeks ago came upon us suddenly, although it had been apparent to those in closest touch with him that his health was failing. We had hoped that he might make a complete recovery and be able to resume his place in the club's councils which he so much valued. His earliest football in his native Wales had brought him international honours when he decided to change his code and join Leeds R.L.F.C. Soon he was at Belle Vue where, for over thirty years he has rendered most useful and untiring service as a player, then on the Staff, and for the last 13\u00bd years on the committee. He has also been Vice-Chairman of the Club and a member of the Rugby League Council. Thus, to our great regret, another good club man has been removed from our midst. Our sympathy goes to his family in their bereavement, the more so since Mrs. Jones has been for some time suffering from serious illness, a combination of extremely sad circumstances.\"Lindley, John (20/02/1960).
