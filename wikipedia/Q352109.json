He was a lecturer on anatomy in Edinburgh, where he introduced the theory of transcendental anatomy. He is now mainly remembered for his involvement in the Burke and Hare murders. An incautious approach to obtaining cadavers for dissection before the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832 and disagreements with professional colleagues ruined his career. A move to London did not improve matters.\nHis later pessimistic view of humanity contrasted sharply with his youthful attachment to the ideas of \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Knox also devoted the latter part of his life to theorising on evolution and ethnology, as well as being one of the pioneers of scientific racism in Britain. His work on the latter further harmed his legacy and overshadowed his contributions to evolutionary theory, which he used to account for racial differences.", "link_mentions": {}}}
