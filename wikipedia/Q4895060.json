Three more victories followed until Christmas saw a downturn in form. Five consecutive post-Christmas defeats to four promotion candidates ended the Vale's promotion campaign. In February Wilf Kirkham was eventually rested, and replacement Stewart Littlewood bagged five in two games to end the run of poor results. Littlewood had previously scored seventy goals for the reserves in just over a season and brought the necessary firepower to help the club surge up the league. Manager Schofield had something of a headache in choosing either the out-of-form legend Kirkham or consistent Littlewood, and only added to the conundrum by signing Blackpool forward Bert Fishwick.
