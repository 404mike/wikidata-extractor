This left Jickling as the only lawyer in Adelaide, South Australia's capital; consequently, he was appointed an acting judge while Jeffcott was gone. Jeffcott, however, died at sea on 12 December 1837, leaving Jickling in charge of the Court. Although appointed as a caretaker judge, Jickling was responsible for two important issues: he codified the testamentary causes jurisdiction of the Court and admitted the first practitioners of the Court, in March 1838.Jickling was also a member of the South Australian Legislative Council.After Charles Cooper arrived as the Chief Justice of South Australia, Jickling ceased to be a judge, and practised at the bar for some years, until he was appointed to the office of Master of the Court, in which position he remained for some years until he retired on the pension then open to all Government officers who had served for a certain period, and returned to England.\nJinkling died at St. Helier's, Jersey on 19 September 1873, aged 73.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Supreme Court of South Australia", "response": ["After Sir John's death in December 1837, Henry Jickling was appointed as an acting judge.
