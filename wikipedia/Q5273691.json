Wimbledon also lifted the FA Amateur Cup in 1962\u201363, beating Sutton United 4\u20132: the club's all-time top goalscorer, Eddie Reynolds, scored all four Wimbledon goals with his head, and in doing so became the only player to have headed in all four of his side's goals in a Wembley match \u2013 as of 2012, still a unique feat. Following these successes the decision was taken to turn professional for the 1964\u201365 season and to enter the Southern League. Wimbledon had continued success in their new league, finishing as runners-up at the first attempt. Wimbledon became nationally famous during an FA Cup run during the 1974\u201375 season: entering the competition at the first qualifying round, Wimbledon saw off first Bracknell Town, then Maidenhead United, Wokingham Town, Guildford & Dorking United, Bath City and Kettering Town to find themselves in the third round proper. They then became the first non-League team that century to beat a First Division side away from home by defeating Burnley at Turf Moor. In the fourth round the good form continued, as the team held the reigning First Division champions Leeds United to a 0\u20130 draw at Elland Road. Goalkeeper Dickie Guy saved a penalty from Peter Lorimer to earn a replay, which was narrowly lost 1\u20130 by an own goal in front of over 40,000 spectators at Selhurst Park. After winning the Southern League three times running from 1974\u201375 to 1976\u201377, Wimbledon were elected to The Football League in place of Workington for the 1977\u201378 season."]}, {"page": "Richard Guy (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Dickie Guy (Richard John Guy, born 1949), English football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "John Fashanu", "response": ["In September 2005 Wimbledon Old Players' Association was launched.
