Moore was a member of the side which won the Southern Football League second division in 1898\u201399. The side conceded only 16 goals in 22 games, 21 of which saw Moore in goal. Regular appearances in the side continued until Thames Ironworks folded in 1900. Their successor club West Ham United included Moore in their second game of the season on 8 September 1900, a 3\u20131 defeat to Millwall Athletic. He replaced Hugh Monteith who had kept goal in the opening game of the season, a 7\u20130 defeat to Gravesend United. Moore would play only three further games for West Ham before he left to join Grays, his place as West Ham goalkeeper returning to Hugh Monteith. Although now playing football for what was a village side, Moore was a member of the Grays side which knocked West Ham, with Monteith in goal, out of the FA Cup on 16 November 1901 at the Memorial Grounds.
