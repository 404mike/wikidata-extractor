He was first elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2003 and was re-elected in 2007 as a Sinn F\u00e9in member for the East Londonderry constituency. He resigned in 2010.\nHis wife, Anne Brolly was the first Sinn F\u00e9in mayor and the first female Mayor of Limavady between 2003 and 2004, the council to which she was elected in 2001.\nIn 2005, he was arrested by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and questioned about a bombing incident in the village of Claudy in 1972. An official complaint was lodged with the Police Ombudsman regarding the lawfulness of the arrest and this investigation was ongoing. Brolly initiated a legal action in relation to the arrest, against the PSNI but he did not proceed with the matter. The case was 'stayed', which means Francie Brolly didn't pursue the matter and there was no out of court settlement, agreement, acceptance of liability or payment of compensation by the police.In February 2018, Brolly left the Sinn F\u00e9in Party over its support for abortion. In March 2018 he and his wife joined Aont\u00fa, a new anti-abortion republican party founded by former Sinn F\u00e9in TD Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brolly", "response": ["* Francie Brolly (born 1947), musician, retired teacher and republican politician from Dungiven, Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 2nd Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Francie Brolly"]}, {"page": "Francie", "response": ["*Francie Brolly (born 1947), Northern Ireland Sinn F\u00e9in politician"]}, {"page": "Claudy bombing", "response": ["On 30 November 2005, the PSNI detained four people in connection with the bombing.
