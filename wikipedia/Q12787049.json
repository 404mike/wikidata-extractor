Previously, this was done by different corps like the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the Corps of Royal Engineers and the Royal Army Service Corps. Soon, the need for an equivalent of the REME was felt in British Indian Army too. Accordingly, the Commander-in-Chief of British forces approved the raising of the Indian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (IEME). On 1 May 1943, the Mechanical Engineering Directorate at General Headquarters was formed and units were allocated. On 15 October 1943, actual transfer of personnel from the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC) to IEME took place. Since then, 15 October is observed as EME Corps day. On 15 September 1944, Lt. Gen. Sir Clarence Bird was appointed as the Colonel Commandant of IEME. After Indian independence, the corps dropped the 'I' from its name and came to be known as the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME). With the proliferation of high technology, the modernisation of the Indian Army in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in use of electronics in all types of equipment which necessitated the corps to change its outlook from electrical to electronics. Thus, the corps was re-christened as the \"Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers\" on 1 January 2001. The Corps of EME also has a cadre of Gp 'A' Gazetted Civilian Technical Officers  who are recruited through coveted Indian Engineering Services Examination (IES) conducted by Union Public Services Commission (UPSC). The civilian officers are mostly posted to Army Base Workshops, EME Directorate and training establishments such as MCEME, Secunderabad and EME School, Baroda.  "]}]}}
