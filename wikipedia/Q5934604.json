He made his first-class debut in an end-of-season match in the 1938 season as the deputy for Syd Buller, who would later be an umpiring colleague.  He was then Buller's replacement for two months of the 1939 season after Buller was seriously injured in the car crash that took the life of opening batsman Charlie Bull during the Whitsun match with Essex.\nReturning to Worcestershire after the Second World War, Yarnold again understudied Buller, who played in 25 of the county's 27 first-class matches. But Yarnold himself played in 17 games, mainly as a batsman. Early in the season, in the match against Sussex at Hove, he made 64 in the first innings, his first score of more than 50.  There were, however, to be only six other scores of more than 50 in his entire career and his season's batting average for 1946, at 15.45 runs per innings, was higher than he achieved in any other season. The 64 was surpassed only once: in 1947, playing for North against South in the traditional end-of-season fixture, he made 68.Buller retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 1946 season, and the following year Yarnold stepped into his position as the regular Worcestershire wicketkeeper. He remained there for the next nine seasons until he himself retired at the end of the 1955 season. In his first season as regular wicketkeeper, he broke the Worcestershire record for the most dismissals in a season, with 85 (plus three more in the North v South match). Two years later, in 1949, he broke his own record and his 110 dismissals that season \u2013 63 catches and 47 stumpings \u2013 put him third on the all-time list for the number of dismissals by a wicketkeeper in one season, exceeded only by Leslie Ames, who made 128 in 1929 and 122 in 1928. In the match against Hampshire at Worcester, he made nine dismissals in the match, and was awarded a bonus of \u00a3100 by the county club. Many of the stumpings, and some catches, were made off the bowling of the unorthodox leg-spinner Roly Jenkins, who took 183 wickets in the season and was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.\nThe 1949 tally of dismissals remains a county record: in 1951 Yarnold achieved what may be a first-class cricket record. Playing against Scotland in a first-class match at Dundee, he equalled the then record for most dismissals in a first-class innings with seven and set what was claimed as a new world record with six stumpings among them.After retiring from first-class cricket in 1955, he became an umpire from 1959 until his death in 1974. He umpired in three Test matches, one each against India and Pakistan in 1967 and one against Australia the following year.\nHe died on the way home from umpiring in a rain-ruined three-day game between Northamptonshire and Essex at Wellingborough when his car crashed into a lorry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": [":1947: Hugo Yarnold"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Hugo Yarnold||||3||1967||1968"]}, {"page": "Michael Bradley (cricketer)", "response": ["Bradley made his debut against Combined Services at Worcester in June 1951, and though he did not bowl in the first innings, he claimed 3-84 in the second; his third wicket was that of Jim Parks.

In the second innings of this game Hugo Yarnold stumped six Scottish batsmen \u2014 this remains a first-class record \u2014 and Bradley took two of those wickets.

The team lacked batting strength and did well to improve their championship position. The outstanding player was Test all-rounder Dick Howorth who was, as in 1946, the first player to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with Peter Jackson who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player Roly Jenkins made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman Reg Perks took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper Hugo Yarnold who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, Eddie Cooper and, in his first full season, Don Kenyon all exceeded 1,000 runs. Worcestershire's best known batsmen at the time were Charles Palmer and the veteran Bob Wyatt and they were the first two in the county averages but neither played a full season. Laddie Outschoorn qualified for the championship for the first time and showed promise. Other players included Ronald Bird, Fred Cooper (brother of Eddie), Norman Whiting and Martin Young.Playfair, pp. 94\u201395.", "* 40 \u2013 Hugo Yarnold (Worcestershire; 31 matches; 48 ct)", "* 88 \u2013 Hugo Yarnold (Worcestershire)"]}, {"page": "Philip John Whitcombe", "response": ["He played all but one of his Worcestershire matches in 1952 as a batsman, with Hugo Yarnold usually behind the stumps.
