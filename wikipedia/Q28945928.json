For the second time in his career, Lee was part of a batting line-up in which each of the top four batsmen scored a century: against Hampshire in Southampton, Lee scored 107, fellow opener Hugh Dales got 103, Hearne reached 232 and Hendren remained 177 not out as Middlesex declared with 642 runs. In 1923, he recorded his best bowling performance, taking eight wickets for the concession of 39 runs in the first innings against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham. He took a further four wickets in the second innings to help Middlesex to an eight wicket victory. He claimed 50 wickets for the third and final time that season, in which he was utilised heavily, being Middlesex's third most used bowler. He did not travel to South Africa in either of 1923\u201324 or 1924\u201325, a fact which he describes as the \"cause and effect\" of his poor form in 1924 and 1925. He travelled to South Africa again in 1926, spending the first of three successive winters in Cape Town, coaching at South African College Schools.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 93\u201394. This coincided with a revival in his county cricket batting form; in 1926 he passed 1,000 runs after missing out on the total for two years."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Hugh Dales (1925/26\u20131926) : H.
