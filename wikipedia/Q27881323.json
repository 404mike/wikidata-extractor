Coia hired 17-year-old Isi Metzstein as an apprentice and continued to design churches and other works for the Roman Catholic Church. The firm's work of this period is considered by architectural historians to be inferior. Rodger describes Coia's difficulty with seeing projects through, which was countered by his \"flair for heading an architectural office\". This led to the development of an atelier-style practice, with Coia gradually handing over design control to concentrate on client relations. In 1954 Andy MacMillan, a contemporary of Metzstein at the GSA, joined the firm from the East Kilbride Development Corporation, and despite neither of the young architects being fully qualified, they had assumed creative control by 1956. Coia's last significant architectural work was for St Charles, North Kelvinside in 1959."]}, {"page": "Nicholas Winton", "response": ["* Isi Metzstein (1928\u20132012), modernist architect"]}, {"page": "History of the Jews in Scotland", "response": ["* Isi Metzstein, architect"]}, {"page": "Hyndland Secondary School", "response": ["*Isi Metzstein, architect,"]}, {"page": "Ptolemy Dean", "response": ["He studied architecture first at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London, then continued with a post-graduate diploma in architecture from the University of Edinburgh.

It was a baronial mansion at the centre of the Kilmahew estate, a Victorian designed ornamental landscape created by the Burns family in the late 1800s. The mansion, built in 1865\u20131868, was originally a family home for James Burns and his son John, and later the Allan family, from the early 20th Century until just after the war, when the estate was sold to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow. Gillespie, Kidd & Coia employees Isi Metzstein and Andy MacMillan developed a radical design in which the old house would become professorial accommodation, and around it would wrap a striking new main block, a convent block, a sanctuary block and a classroom block. The old house thus became one side of a quadrangle, creating a juxtaposition between old and new buildings."]}, {"page": "Andy MacMillan", "response": ["MacMillan joined his lifelong friend Isi Metzstein at Gillespie, Kidd & Coia in 1954 and the pair went on to become the firm's lead designers, both becoming partners in the business in 1966."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Jews", "response": ["* Isi Metzstein, modernist architect"]}, {"page": "1996 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Professor Isi Metzstein.
