In his obituary in the 1953 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he was described as \"probably the fastest bowler in the history of the game\", a testimony fervently supported by countless of those who saw and faced him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Arlott", "response": ["He was also invited in 1981 to select his Best XI from players who, for a wide variety of reasons, were never capped by England.

Although invited for trials by Lancashire at Old Trafford he was turned down 'because he dipped at the knee', so he qualified for Northamptonshire in 1952 through residence. Tyson made his first-class debut against the Indian tourists in 1952, after his first ball the slips moved back an extra five yards and his first wicket was that of the Test batsman Pankaj Roy for a duck.Willis & Murphy, p. 89. Tyson's second first-class match was against the Australians in 1953. Richie Benaud was told that the unknown Tyson was a bowler fresh out of Durham University who would give them no trouble. They began to revise this estimation when they saw the wicket-keeper take position halfway to the boundary and young Tyson walked over to the sightscreen to begin his run up. The first ball ricocheted off the edge of Colin McDonald's bat to the boundary, the second trapped him lbw before he could play a stroke, the third was a bouncer that flew past Graeme Hole's nose and the fourth was a yorker that clean bowled Hole and sent his stumps cartwheeling over the wicket-keeper's head.p183, Bird, 1999. In 1954 at Old Trafford Tyson hit the sightscreen with the ball after it bounced once on the pitch. He is one of only four bowlers to have achieved this feat in the history of the game, the others being Charles Kortright, Roy Gilchrist and Jeff Thomson.. and he was given his county cap in the same year, his first full first-class season. Tyson reckoned that he received his Test call up when ex-England captains Gubby Allen and Norman Yardley saw him hospitalise Bill Edrich at Lords. Edrich, a noted hooker of fast bowling, mistimed his stroke due to the speed of the ball and his cheek bone was broken. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were thereby convinced of the speed and hostility of Tyson's bowling and decided to take him to Australia.p8, Tyson He was selected to play for England against Pakistan at the Oval in 1954, taking 4\u201335 and 1\u201322 and making 3 runs in each innings batting at number eight, but Pakistan won the match by 24 runs thanks to the bowling of Fazal Mahmood.

He used to start up the roller to refurbish the wicket when I went in to bat\".p126, Frank Tyson, The Cricketer Who Laughed, Stanley Paul, 1982 Tyson worked on his batting and in 1954 \"was building up a reputation as an all-rounder, scoring consistently with the bat\",p19, E.W.

Essex lost five wickets on the first day, with Frederick Fane, Charlie McGahey and Charles Kortright all passing 50. Jones took four wickets as Essex could only add a further 34 on the second day, before Australia were bowled out 113 short; Trumper made nearly half the total, while no Essex bowler took more than two wickets.

Only in 1899, when he played in 11 games, did he appear in more than half a dozen games, and more than half of the games he played for the county were early-season matches that started in May, a time when county cricket's regular contingent of amateur players tended to be less available. His highest aggregate of runs was 470 in the 1899 season and in 1901 he was top of the Gloucestershire averages, with 334 runs at an average of 37.11, beating Gilbert Jessop in that season. He hit an unbeaten 109 in that season in the match against Essex. The Wisden obituary records Hale reminiscing about the pace of Essex fast bowler Charles Kortright and claiming that \"he hit me black and blue\"; in fact, the bulk of the Essex bowling was done by medium-pace bowlers and Kortright failed to take a wicket in his 20 overs. In 1902, he improved on that score with an innings of 135, including 21 fours and a six, that enabled Gloucestershire to draw the match against Nottinghamshire after being made to follow on. This was the highest score of Hale's first-class career."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Charles Kortright (1893\u20131900)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Charles Kortright (1893) : C.
