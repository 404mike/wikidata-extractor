He has also published two novels under the name of Stanley Manly. The first of these, Raiders of the Low Forehead, was published in 1999 and was one of the first three offerings of Attack! Books. According to a review on Spank the Monkey, the work was \"less of a novel than a series of sketches with the slightest of narrative threads holding them together: all short punchy chapters, full of crap puns, relentless internal rhymes and blatantly obvious storytelling.\" Nixon's next novel, Workington Dynamo, was published in 2008 and follows a more formal structure. The book was noted by 3:AM Magazine to be \"a hetero love story for a grrl as well as the soccer club, and his wimmin are a violent counter blast to the rich, thin tory-sucking anti-feminists that currently seem to think that fat poor people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to live. Young Dougie Grimton is after his cousin Kerry and the result is a sweet but tangy element amidst the picaresque madness.\"", "=== Stanley Manly ==="]}]}}
