In August and early September 1814 he arranged to join a voyage to inspect the lighthouses around the Scottish coast on the cutter of the Commissioners for the Northern Lights so that when he resumed work on The Lord of the Isles he would be 'strong on scenery'.Ibid., 487 (Scott to James Ballantyne, 1 September 1814); compare 498 (Scott to J. B. S. Morritt, 14 September 1814) and 501 (Scott to Richard Polwhele, September 1814). He had hoped to have the work ready for the Christmas trade,Ibid., 499 (Scott to Constable, 17 September 1814). but although he made good progress it took a month longer than he had anticipated: Canto 3 was complete by 10 November,Ibid., 518 (James Ballantyne to Maria Edgeworth, 10 November 1814). and the last stanza of the sixth and final canto was sent off on 16 December.Johnson, op. cit., 465."]}]}}
