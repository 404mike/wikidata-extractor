First, matrices contributed new hypercomplex numbers like 2 \u00d7 2 real matrices (see Split-quaternion).

In 1907 Joseph Wedderburn showed that associative hypercomplex systems could be represented by square matrices, or direct product of algebras of square matrices.Emil Artin later generalized Wedderburn's result so it is known as the Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem From that date the preferred term for a hypercomplex system became associative algebra as seen in the title of Wedderburn's thesis at University of Edinburgh.
