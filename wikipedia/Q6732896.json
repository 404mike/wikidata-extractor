The family name 'Onychodontidae' was created for Onychodus by the British palaeontologist Arthur Smith Woodward in 1891. The group of onychodontiformes, described in 1973 by the late Dr. Mahala Andrews, was characterized by a highly kinetic skull and tusk-like teeth.", "The new species found at Gogo Formation in Kimberley, Western Australia, Onychodus jandemarrai, is the best known species of the genus. It was described in 2006 based on extensive research by the late Dr. Mahala Andrews, with colleagues Dr John Long, Dr Per Ahlberg, Prof. Ken Campbell and Dr Richard Barwick from material collected by the British Museum of Natural History, the Bureau of Mineral Resources and the Australian National University in Canberra. New material gathered by Dr. Long from the limestone in the Gogo formation, where he visited many times, contributed much information. Although much is known of this species, there are missing details such as the shape of the posterior end of the tail, the pectoral and pelvic fins and the first dorsal fin. The name of species O. jandemarrai comes from the Aboriginal warrior Jandamarra who lived in that area."]}, {"page": "List of paleontologists", "response": ["* Mahala Andrews (Scotland, 1939-1997)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 1997", "response": ["*Mahala Andrews, 58, British vertebrae palaeontologist."]}, {"page": "Mahala (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Mahala Andrews (1939\u20131997), British vertebrae palaeontologist"]}, {"page": "Sheila Mahala Andrews", "response": ["#REDIRECTMahala Andrews"]}]}}
