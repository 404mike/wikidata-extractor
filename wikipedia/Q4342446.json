The King had thus a unique opportunity to form a broader government of national consensus, and abolish the hated dictatorial regime\u2014whose sole bastion of support he now was. Although he was urged to this step by the influential British ambassador, Michael Palairet, George refused."]}, {"page": "Ioannis Metaxas", "response": ["To break the German dominance of the Balkans, the British agreed to launch an \"economic offensive\" into the Balkans in November 1938, though the question of whatever Britain should buy the Greek tobacco crop led to much debate within the British government as objections were made that British smokers, accustomed to Canadian and American tobacco, should not have to smoke Greek tobacco.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pp. 89-90. Metaxas himself had a reputation as a Germanophile dating back to his studies in Germany and his role in the National Schism.  The regime's literature gave praise to fellow European authoritarian states, especially those of Francisco Franco, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. In October 1938, Metaxas  asked Michael Palairet, the British minister in Athens, for an alliance out of the hope that the British would turn him down (as they did), thereby justifying Greek neutrality if another world war should break out."]}, {"page": "Operation Bernhard", "response": ["Although the discussion was supposed to be secret, in November 1939 Michael Palairet, Britain's ambassador to Greece, met a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who gave him full details of the plan discussed at the 18 September meeting; according to the \u00e9migr\u00e9's report, the plan was titled \"Offensive against Sterling and Destruction of its Position as World Currency\". Palairet reported the information to London, who alerted the US Department of the Treasury and the Bank of England. Although the Bank considered the existing security measures were sufficient, in 1940 it released a blue emergency \u00a31 note which had a metal security thread running through the paper. It also banned the import of pound notes for the duration of the war in 1943, stopped producing new \u00a35 notes and warned the public about the danger of counterfeit currency."]}, {"page": "Julian Asquith, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Asquith", "response": ["On 28 August 1947, Lord Oxford married Anne Mary Celestine Palairet,Neville, P.

The Foreign Office first learned of this plan from the Yugoslav Regent, Prince Paul, in November 1939. On 3 November 1939, Lord Halifax called a meeting to discuss the merits and demerits of the Balkan League plan, which Lloyd was allowed to attend by special permission of Halifax over the objections of Cadogan who argued that an outsider like Lord Lloyd should be attending a Foreign Office meeting.Atherton, Louise \"Lord Lloyd at the British Council and the Balkan Front, 1937\u20131940\" pages 25\u201348 from The International History Review, Vol. 16, No. 1, Feb., 1994 pages 41."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Austria", "response": ["*1937\u20131938: Michael Palairet"]}, {"page": "Raymond Asquith, 3rd Earl of Oxford and Asquith", "response": ["Asquith was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for \"diplomatic services\" in 1992.

Under strong pressure from Sir Michael Palairet, the British minister in Athens, who wanted a more representative government than the 4th of August Regime, the king named Emmanouil Tsouderos prime minister on 21 April 1941. Tsouderos, a former governor of the Central Bank of Greece, was not a professional politician, being appointed only because he had been exiled under the Metaxas regime, which therefore allowed the king to claim to Palairet that he was broadening the cabinet. However, Tsouderos as prime minister proved reluctant to disassociate the government-in-exile from the 4th of August Regime legacy, moving very slowly and cautiously. On 25 April 1941, with the onset of the Battle of Greece, King George II and his government left the Greek mainland for Crete, which was attacked by Nazi forces on 20 May 1941. The Germans employed parachute forces in a massive airborne invasion and attacked the three main airfields of the island.
