Accusations of a bias against the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party were often made against the BBC by members of that government, with Margaret Thatcher herself considering the broadcaster's news coverage to be biased and irresponsible. In 2011, Peter Sissons, a main news presenter at the BBC from 1989 to 2009, said that \"at the core of the BBC, in its very DNA, is a way of thinking that is firmly of the Left\". Another BBC presenter, Andrew Marr, commented that \"the BBC is not impartial or neutral. It has a liberal bias, not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias.\" Former BBC director Roger Mosey classified it as \"liberal defensive.\"  The BBC was accused of propaganda by conservative journalist and author Toby Young due to what he believed to be an anti-Brexit approach, which included a day of live programming on migration.The BBC's focus on immigration was a whole day of anti-Brexit propaganda .
