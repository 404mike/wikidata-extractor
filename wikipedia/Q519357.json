Unfortunately it is that quality that is missing in 4.50 from Paddington. The police never seem to find out a single thing, and even Miss Marples (sic) lies low and says nuffin' to the point until the final dramatic exposure.

For the latest tug on the Christie handle produces a product which is not only up to the standard but even above it. The Pale Horse is in fact the best sample from this particular factory for some time, and that is saying plenty.

This is a book which nobody (repeat, nobody) should miss.\"The Guardian 8 December 1961 (p. 7) Iles further named the novel as his favourite in the paper's Critic's choice for the end of the year, published one week later, writing that \"It has not been an outstanding year for crime fiction, but as usual there have been one or two first-class items.
