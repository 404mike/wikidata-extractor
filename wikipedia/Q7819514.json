His father forbade him from joining Celtic as he did not want him involved in the religion-based rivalry with Rangers, and Bremner rejected both Arsenal and Chelsea as he did not enjoy his stay in London during trial spells with the two clubs, and was instead convinced to join Bill Lambton's Leeds United in 1959. He joined along with his friend Tommy Henderson, who would return to Scotland due to homesickness without making a first team debut. Manager Jack Taylor gave him his debut at outside-right in a 3\u20131 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, at the age of 17 years and 47 days; Yorkshire Evening Post reporter Phil Brown noted that Bremner showed \"enthusiasm, guts, intelligence, most accurate use of the ball and unselfishness\" despite poor weather conditions. A The Sunday Times headline later dubbed him as \"10st of barbed wire\" due to his tenacity and tough tackling. Regular outside-right Chris Crowe was sold to Blackburn Rovers in March 1960, allowing Bremner to take his place on a permanent basis. However, Leeds went on to be relegated from the First Division at the end of the 1959\u201360 season."]}, {"page": "Thomas Henderson", "response": ["* Tommy Henderson (Thomas Gibson Henderson, 1887\u20131970), Independent Unionist politician from Belfast", "* Tommy Henderson (footballer, born 1902) (1902\u2013?), English footballer", "* Tommy Henderson (footballer, born 1927) (1927\u20132013), English professional footballer", "* Tommy Henderson (footballer, born 1943), Scottish former professional footballer", "* Tommy Henderson (footballer, born 1949), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Tommy Henderson (footballer born 1943)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Henderson (footballer, born 1943)"]}, {"page": "1978 National Soccer League (Canada) season", "response": ["|Tommy Henderson"]}]}}
