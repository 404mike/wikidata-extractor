Forrester made his debut for Warwickshire against Leicestershire in May 1896. He took a wicket and two catches in each of the innings. In a match against Hampshire he took 7 wickets for 56. During the 1897 season he took 5 for 72 against Leicestershire in his nine games. In 1898 he was down to four matches and in 1899 played seven.\nAfter a break, he joined Derbyshire in the 1902 season. He played modestly in 1902 and 1903, and played just one game in the 1904 season. There was another break in his first-class cricket career, and he returned in the 1910 season a considerably developed player. He made 78 runs in a match against Hampshire although his bowling did not take off until the 1911 season. In that year he took 5 for 161 against Surrey, 5 for 36 against Lancashire, 6 for 39 against Northamptonshire and 6 for 30 against Hampshire. He also made 73 runs in a match against Essex. In the 1912 season he took 5 for 76 against an Australian touring side and his best performance of 7 for 18 against Northamptonshire. He also scored 84 not out against Essex. In the 1913 season he made his top score of 87 against Essex and took 5 for 76 against Sussex, 5 for 88 against Hampshire, 6 for 72 against Lancashire and 7 for 127 against Nottinghamshire. In the 1914 season he had two ten wicket matches with 5 for 47 and 5 for 83 in the same match against Lancashire, and 7 for 89 and 7 for 124 in the same match against Essex. First-class cricket was interrupted by the First World War, and Forrester played just two games in the 1920 season. Against Yorkshire he maintained form, but in his last match against Lancashire, after failing to take a wicket in 20 overs he was absent hurt for the remainder of the game and did not play again.\nForrester was a right-arm medium pace bowler and took 347 first-class wickets at an average of 25.70 and a best performance of 7 for 18. He took seventeen 5-wicket innings and three 10-wicket matches. He was a left-hand batsman and played 212 innings in 131 matches with an average of 15.80 and a top score of 87.Forrester died at Standard Hill, Nottingham at the age of 54.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Bestwick", "response": ["Derbyshire played host to a team of South Africans in 1901, as the young Test nation played a series of eleven warm-up matches against English county sides prior to a Test series against the English cricket team. However, a publicity boost such as this only served to panic an ever-spiralling Derbyshire team into once again finishing in bottom place in the table. The following year, 1902, was slightly more encouraging for Derbyshire, as, boosted by the appearance of long-time Warwickshire player Thomas Forrester, after three years out of the game, Derbyshire finished in their highest position since the beginning of Bestwick's career, finishing the season in tenth place. Bestwick bowled very well in a summer when pitches were almost always too wet to suit a bowler of his pace, and was probably the second best fast bowler in county cricket after William Lockwood."]}, {"page": "Alonzo Drake", "response": ["He claimed remarkable 4/4 and 3/3 returns, for match figures of 7/7, against Somerset at The Recreation Ground, Bath in 1913. He grabbed 5/6 in the second innings against Derbyshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield in 1914, including the wickets of Richard Baggallay, Gilbert Curgenven, Colin Hurt and Thomas Forrester in consecutive balls. His most famous feat was the taking all ten Somerset wickets for 35 at Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare in August 1914, when he took 15 in the match for 51 runs. He bowled unchanged throughout both innings of the match. Only Drake, Hedley Verity (twice), and Frank Smailes, have taken all ten wickets in an innings for Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["| 1913|| 18 ||4 || 10 ||4 ||13|| Richard Baggallay ||Leonard Oliver || Thomas Forrester|| Joe Humphries"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1920", "response": ["John Chapman was captain for the season, having held the post twice before World War I. The team was very unstable. Thirty eight players played for Derbyshire in the season, but only six played in more than half the matches. The club suffered from the absence of devastating bowler Billy Bestwick for all but one match, in which he took seven wickets, while other players such as Thomas Forrester and Arnold Warren were drawing to the end of their career. Leonard Oliver was top scorer and Arthur Morton with 89 wickets did the bulk of the bowling with Samuel Cadman. Oliver and Morton were the only players to score centuries."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1913", "response": ["Richard Baggallay was in his first year as captain.

Also making his debut was Charles Ollivierre the first Caribbean to play for an English county who also played several seasons. Noah Buxton played occasionally until 1911 and Guy Wilson played once in 1902 and once in 1905. Other players who  made their debut but played only in 1902 were Charles Lyon who played two matches and Ernest Stapleton, Archibold Cooper and Bert Hall who played one each."]}, {"page": "Thomas Forrester (disambiguation)", "response": ["Thomas Forrester  is a fictional character.", "Thomas Forrester may also refer to:", "*Thomas Forrester (politician) (1790\u20131841), merchant and political figure in Nova Scotia", "*Thomas Forrester (cricketer) (1873\u20131927), English cricketer", "*Thomas Forrester (theologian) (1635?\u20131706), Scottish theologian", "*Thomas Forrester (architect) (1838\u20131907), New Zealand architect", "*Thomas Forrester, presenter and antiques expert on British television programme Bargain Hunt"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Thomas Forrester (1896\u20131899) : T.
