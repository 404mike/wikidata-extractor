After military service on the Western Front during World War I, he studied at Lincoln College, Oxford, taking a degree in history.  He worked as a teacher and lecturer from 1920 to 1948, when he gave up the profession to concentrate on his work for the Urdd.\nIn 1922, Edwards wrote a letter to the periodical Cymru'r Plant, which led to the founding of the Urdd, and the first Urdd recreational camp was held at Llanuwchllyn in 1928, under his direction. The first Urdd local branch was founded in Treuddyn. It was gradually followed by more permanent camps and residential centres.  In partnership with J. Ellis Williams, he made the first Welsh language sound film, The Quarryman.  In 1947 he was knighted in recognition of his youth work, and the Urdd had his portrait painted by Alfred Janes in 1956.  He was a director of Television Wales and the West and encouraged the making of television programmes in Welsh.  His son, Owen Edwards, would become the first chief executive of S4C.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Ifan ab Owen Edwards (1895\u20131970), founder of Urdd Gobaith Cymru"]}, {"page": "1922 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** A letter written by Ifan ab Owen Edwards to the children's periodical Cymru'r Plant results in establishment in Wales of the youth organisation Urdd Gobaith Cymru."]}, {"page": "Urdd Gobaith Cymru", "response": ["Urdd Gobaith Cymru (or 'Urdd Gobaith Cymru Fach') was established by Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards in 1922.

Henry Edwards who directed A Welsh Singer, also created the 1930 film Aylwin, from the novel by Theodore Watts-Dunton, drawing into the world of gypsies and a mythical, mystical Wales. The 1930s saw the first Welsh language film, Y Chwarelwr directed by Ifan ab Owen Edwards in 1935. The decade also saw two important agitprop documentaries, Today We Live (1937) set among the unemployed miners of the village of Pentre in the Rhondda Valleys, and Donald Alexander's Eastern Valley (1937). The outbreak of World War II saw the backdrop of a mining valley in Wales being used as the setting for a war propaganda film, The Silent Village (1943).
