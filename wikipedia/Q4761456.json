His first appearance of the season came on 23 August 2005, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2\u20131 win over Sunderland. After being dropped from the first team in early\u2013September, Onuoha returned against Doncaster Rovers in a League Cup match, where he was red carded for the first time in his career, after a collision with Rovers goalkeeper Andy Warrington. The red card was later rescinded however Manchester City went on to lose the game on penalties. Since returning to the first team, Onuoha continued to fight for his first team place, competing in the defensive starting line\u2013up for the side. However, he soon suffered a groin injury that saw him sidelined for two months. While on the sidelines, Onuoha was awarded BBC North West Sports Personality of the Year Award for newcomer honour. It wasn't until on 12 December 2005 when he returned from injury, starting the whole game, in a 4\u20131 win over Birmingham City. Onuoha was featured in the next six matches since returning from injury. Amid to the first team, he was linked with a move to Liverpool but was happy to stay at the club. However, Onuoha damaged his knee ligament that kept him out for the rest of the 2005\u201306 season.

He signed a two-year contract and looked to compete for the starting goalkeeper spot with fellow Dane Jan Budtz.  One of the tallest players in the league, Nielsen was known as \"The Gentle Giant\" of football.  He did not find much playing time at Doncaster, and only played one game in the pre-season.  He suffered injuries and was soon third goalkeeper choice at the club.  He did appear on the pitch after a match against Manchester City, talking to Jan Budtz after the horrible scenes when Doncaster's first choice keeper Andy Warrington broke his right leg.  Nielsen was eventually released from his contract in October 2006, and moved back to Denmark to play part-time football with Greve IF in the Danish 2nd Division."]}, {"page": "Scott Shearer", "response": ["He made his first appearance for the club on 14 July 2012, where he kept a second half (Andy Warrington was played in the first) clean sheet in a 6\u20130 victory over local club Parkgate in the first friendly of pre-season. He appeared in most of the remaining friendlies too, thus sealing his place as the first choice goalkeeper at the club. Shearer made his professional Rotherham d\u00e9but on the opening day of the 2012\u201313 season. It finished with a compelling 3\u20130 scoreline in Rotherham United's favour, with Shearer keeping a clean sheet. It was not to be repeated three days later however, as he conceded two goals in a 2\u20131 defeat to Northampton Town at the Sixfields Stadium. Shearer continued to hold the jersey, despite letting in six goals in a 6\u20132 defeat to Port Vale, still very early into the season. Due to an operation, Shearer was out for six weeks, meaning there was a chance that he could lose his number one spot altogether to Andy Warrington."]}, {"page": "Jan Budtz", "response": ["Born in Hiller\u00f8d, Budtz became an instant hero in his first game for Doncaster Rovers when he replaced the injured Andy Warrington during a League Cup tie against Manchester City in September 2005.

Captain Mark Roberts added a fourth shortly after the interval, his second goal of the season \u2013 his first also coming against Barnet. Barnet added two consolation goals in the space of three second-half minutes through Izale McLeod and Mark Marshall. The win meant that Stevenage had secured their first three points since early November.
