Wilson considered this a matter of urgency as he had heard a rumour that Rhodesia might declare independence on its main national holiday, Rhodes' Day (that year 12 July), but this proved false. On 15 July, Britain's High Commissioner to Rhodesia, John Baines Johnston, was instructed to propose a week-long round of talks between Smith and Hughes in Salisbury. Johnston was given permission to cave if the Rhodesian Prime Minister insisted on meeting with Bottomley, but this did not prove necessary: Smith cabled back on the 18th accepting Hughes' visit. The British delegation arrived in Salisbury four days later."]}, {"page": "1962 New Year Honours", "response": ["* John Baines Johnston, British High Commissioner in Sierra Leone."]}, {"page": "1966 New Year Honours", "response": ["* John Baines Johnston, , lately British High Commissioner, Salisbury."]}, {"page": "List of Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George", "response": ["|Sir John Baines Johnston"]}, {"page": "List of Knights and Dames Commander of the Royal Victorian Order appointed by Elizabeth II (1952\u201377)", "response": ["|Sir John Baines Johnston, KCMG"]}]}}
