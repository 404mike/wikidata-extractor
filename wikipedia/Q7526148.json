He was part of the intellectual and literary circle of Lichfield, which included Anna Seward and Erasmus Darwin. In 1766 he welcomed the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Ashbourne circles, after Rousseau's short stay in London with Hume. Ten years later, in 1776, Boothby visited Rousseau in Paris, and was given the manuscript of the first part of Rousseau's three-part autobiographic Confessions. Boothby translated the manuscript and published it in Lichfield in 1780 after the author's death, and donated the document to the British Library in 1781.\nThe well-known portrait of Boothby by Joseph Wright of Derby, from 1781, shows him reclining in a wooded glade with a book carrying on its cover simply the name Rousseau, indicating Boothby's admiration and promotion of the writer and his work generally.Several portraits were also made of Boothby's daughter, Penelope\u2014by Henry Fuseli and Joshua Reynolds and in sculpture by Thomas Banks. She died young, and was the subject of a book of poetry by her grieving father.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ashbourne, Derbyshire", "response": ["*Sir Brooke Boothby, 6th Baronet (1744\u20131824), poet, was born here.Rebecca Mills, \"Boothby, Sir Brooke, seventh baronet (1744\u20131824)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2010 accessed 2 January 2017 "]}, {"page": "St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne", "response": ["One in particular stands out; the Boothby monument to Penelope Boothby, daughter of Sir Brooke Boothby, 6th Baronet.

Boothby, like his father before him, was extravagant. He purchased from Joseph Wright of Derby two paintings of Dovedale, two views of nearby Matlock, two paintings of bridges in Rome as well as an unusual portrait of himself."]}, {"page": "Boothby (surname)", "response": ["*Sir Brooke Boothby, 6th Baronet (1744\u20131824), British poet and friend of Jean-Jacques Rousseau"]}, {"page": "Sir Brooke Boothby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Brooke Boothby, 6th Baronet"]}]}}
