Annually he works with Roddy MacLeod to organise the Piping Live! Festival.He performed with Jay-Z, P Diddy and Alicia Keys in 2010 and later with Bryan Adams at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.As well as musical collaborations and performances, MacDonald appeared in the Michael Keaton film A Shot at Glory.In 2012, MacDonald was the co-star with Alastair Campbell in a Sky Arts documentary, First Love, in which he taught the former Labour Party strategist, who had learned the pipes as a child, to prepare for a major solo piping performance at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow. The experience rekindled Campbell's love of piping, and MacDonald has since become his tutor, and the pair have performed together at a number of events, including anti-Brexit rallies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Border pipes", "response": ["*Finlay MacDonald"]}, {"page": "Royal Conservatoire of Scotland", "response": ["*Finlay MacDonald"]}, {"page": "Finlay Macdonald", "response": ["Finlay Macdonald or Finlay MacDonald may refer to:", "*Finlay MacDonald (musician) (born 1978), Scottish bagpiper", "*Finlay MacDonald (politician, born 1866) (died 1948), Canadian Member of Parliament for Cape Breton South, Nova Scotia", "*Finlay MacDonald (politician, born 1923) (died 2002), Canadian senator", "*Finlay MacDonald (Teenage Fanclub), Scottish rock musician"]}, {"page": "Finlay", "response": ["*Finlay MacDonald (musician) (born 1978), Scottish bagpiper", "*Finlay MacDonald (politician, born 1866) (died 1948), Canadian Member of Parliament for Cape Breton South, Nova Scotia", "*Finlay MacDonald (politician, born 1923) (died 2002), Canadian senator"]}, {"page": "Norman Blake (Scottish musician)", "response": ["Blake has produced recordings for Speedboat (featuring Finlay MacDonald), The Pearlfishers and 1990s.
