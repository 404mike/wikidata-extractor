It featured rock, folk, blues, classical and electronic music. A unique feature of the programme was the inclusion of tracks, mostly of exotic non-Western music, drawn from the BBC Sound Archive; the most popular of these were gathered on a BBC Records LP, John Peel's Archive Things (1970). Night Ride also featured poetry readings and numerous interviews with a wide range of guests, including his friends Marc Bolan, journalist and musician Mick Farren, poet Pete Roche, and singer-songwriter Bridget St John and stars such as the Byrds, the Rolling Stones, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The programme captured much of the creative activity of the underground scene. Its anti-establishment stance and unpredictability did not find approval with the BBC hierarchy, and it ended in September 1969 after 18 months. In his sleeve notes to the Archive Things LP Peel calls the free-form nature of Night Ride his preferred radio format. His subsequent shows featured a mixture of records and live sessions, a format that would characterise his Radio 1 programmes for the rest of his career."]}, {"page": "Mot\u00f6rhead", "response": ["Lemmy wanted the music to be \"fast and vicious, just like the MC5\". His stated aim was to \"concentrate on very basic music: loud, fast, city, raucous, arrogant, paranoid, speedfreak rock n roll ... it will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, your lawn will die\". He recruited guitarist Larry Wallis (formerly of Pink Fairies) on the recommendation of Mick Farren, based on Wallis' work with Steve Peregrin Took's band Shagrat, and Lucas Fox on drums. According to Lemmy, the band's first practice was at the now defunct Sound Management rehearsal studios, in Kings Road, Chelsea in 1975. Sound Management leased the basement area of furniture store The Furniture Cave, located in adjacent Lots Road. Kilmister has said they used to steal equipment, as the band was short on gear.

It has been described as \"anaemic\" and \"soulless\". Synth-pop's early steps, and Gary Numan in particular, were also disparaged in the British music press of the late 1970s and early 1980s for their German influences and characterised by journalist Mick Farren as the \"Adolf Hitler Memorial Space Patrol\". In 1983, Morrissey of the Smiths stated that \"there was nothing more repellent than the synthesizer\". During the decade, objections were raised to the quality of compositions and the limited musicianship of artists. Gary Numan observed \"hostility\" and what he felt was  \"ignorance\" regarding synth-pop, such as his belief that people \"thought machines did it\"."]}, {"page": "NME", "response": ["In 1976, NME lambasted German pioneer electronic band Kraftwerk with this title: \"This is what your fathers fought to save you from ...\" The article said that the \"electronic melodies flowed as slowly as a piece of garbage floating down the polluted Rhine\".Miles. \"Kraftwerk: This is what your fathers fought to save you from\". NME. 16 October 1976. Retrieved 8 August 2013 The same year also saw punk rock arrive on what some people perceived to be a stagnant music scene. The NME gave the Sex Pistols their first music press coverage in a live review of their performance at the Marquee in February that year, but overall it was slow to cover this new phenomenon in comparison to Sounds and Melody Maker, where Jonh Ingham and Caroline Coon respectively were early champions of punk. Although articles by the likes of Mick Farren (whose article \"The Titanic Sails at Dawn\" called for a new street-led rock movement in response to stadium rock) were published by the NME that summer, it was felt that younger writing was needed to credibly cover the emerging punk movement, and the paper advertised for a pair of \"hip young gunslingers\" to join their editorial staff. This resulted in the recruitment of Tony Parsons and Julie Burchill. The pair rapidly became champions of the punk scene and created a new tone for the paper. Parsons' time at NME is reflected in his 2005 novel Stories We Could Tell, about the misadventures of three young music-paper journalists on the night of 16 August 1977 \u2013 the night Elvis Presley died."]}, {"page": "1970 in music", "response": ["* Mona - The Carnivorous Circus - Mick Farren"]}, {"page": "List of heavy metal bands", "response": ["|The Deviants || United Kingdom ||1967\u20131969, 1978, 1984, 1996, 2002, 2011\u2013present || Singer and writer Mick Farren died on 27 July 2013."]}, {"page": "John Cale", "response": ["On his aforementioned visit to Britain in the summer of 1965, Cale shopped a crudely recorded, acoustic-based Velvet Underground demo reel to several luminaries in the British rock scene (including Marianne Faithfull) with the intention of securing a record deal.

In the video game series Darksiders, the four horsemen of the apocalypse are said to be nephilim, wherein the nephilim were created by the unholy union of angels and demons. The main characters of the game DmC: Devil May Cry (2013), a reboot of the popular original series Devil May Cry, Dante and Vergil, are also referred to as Nephilim; being the offspring of the demon Sparda and the angel Eva. In the trading card game Magic: The Gathering, the Nephilim are interpreted as Old Gods from before modern society. In Diablo 3, the Nephalem were the first humans upon Sanctuary, created as a result of the union between Angels and Demons. A creature referred to as \"Nephilim\" appears in Season 2 of the Japanese animated series Symphogear.
