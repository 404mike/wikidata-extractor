W. H. T. Douglas, when Australia won every match of the five-Test series. He was one of the few English successes.McKinstry, p. 193. He scored two centuries in the opening three first-class games, and in the first Test top-scored in both England innings with 49 and 59.McKinstry, pp. 194\u201395. In the second Test, he scored 122 on a difficult pitch which had been affected by rain.McKinstry, pp. 195\u201396. Wisden commented that this was \"from the English point of view, the finest innings of the tour\". He also scored a century in defeat in the third Test, hitting 123 in the final innings as England failed to score 489 to win the game.McKinstry, p. 196. He did not pass 50 again in the series; after a failure on the fourth Test, he tore a thigh muscle batting in a game before the final Test. Persuaded by Douglas to play anyway, he scored 40 and 34 but struggled to field effectively. One unsuccessful attempt to chase the ball caused some of the crowd to jeer him, which led to controversy when two amateur members of the team, Percy Fender and Rockley Wilson, wrote scathingly about the incident.McKinstry, pp. 197\u201398. Hobbs scored a total of 924 first-class runs on the tour, at an average of 51.33; in Test matches, he scored 505 runs at 50.50.

Russell partnered Hobbs, they could not replicate their former successes,McKinstry, p. 197. and shared only one stand worth more than fifty."]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["In 1914, Jardine entered Winchester College. At the time, life for pupils at Winchester was arduous and austere; discipline was harsh. Sport and exercise were vital parts of the school day. In Jardine's time, preparing the pupils for war was also important.Douglas, pp. 6\u20139. According to Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, the pupils were \"taught to be honest, practical, impervious to physical pain, uncomplaining and civilised.\"Douglas, p. 9. All pupils were required to be academically competent and as such Jardine was able to get along satisfactorily without exhibiting academic brilliance; successful sportsmen, on the other hand, were revered.Douglas, p. 13. Jardine enjoyed a slightly better position than some pupils, already possessing a reputation as a very fine cricketer and excelling at other sports; he represented the school at football as a goalkeeper and rackets, and played Winchester College football.Douglas, pp. 6, 13\u201314. But it was at cricket that he particularly excelled. He was in the first eleven for three years from 1917 and received coaching from Harry Altham, Rockley Wilson and Schofield Haigh, the latter two of whom were distinguished cricketers.Douglas, pp. 11\u201312. In 1919, his final year, Jardine came top of the school batting averages with 997 runs at an average of 66.46. He also became captain despite some doubts within the school about his ability to unify the team.Douglas, p. 15. Under Jardine, Winchester won their annual match against Eton College in 1919, a fixture in which Eton had usually held the upper hand.Douglas, p. 11. Jardine's batting (35 and 89 in the match) and captaincy were key factors in his side's first victory over Eton for 12 years. Years later, after his retirement from cricket, he named his 89 in that match as his personal favourite innings. Jardine went on to score 135 not out against Harrow School.Douglas, pp. 17\u201318.Frith, p. 70.", "A week after the Test, it was announced that Jardine would captain the M.C.C. team to Australia that winter, although he seemed to have had last minute doubts about accepting.Douglas, pp. 107\u201308. Others were also concerned about whether he was the best choice. For example, Rockley Wilson is reputed to have said that with Jardine as captain, \"We shall win the Ashes\u00a0... but we may well lose a Dominion\". However, the selectors thought that a determined leader was needed to defeat the Australians and a more disciplined approach than that of Percy Chapman on the previous tour was needed.Douglas, pp. 96, 108\u201309. Jardine began to plan tactics from this point, discussing ideas with various people. He was aware that Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the main worry of the selectors, had occasionally shown vulnerability to pace bowling. During the final Test of the 1930 Ashes at the Oval, during Bradman's innings of 232, the wicket became difficult for a time following rain. Bradman was briefly seen to be uncomfortable facing deliveries that bounced higher than usual at a faster pace. Percy Fender was one of many cricketers who noticed, and he discussed this with Jardine in 1932.Frith, pp. 42\u201343.Douglas, p. 111. When Jardine later saw film footage of the Oval incident and noticed Bradman's discomfort, he shouted, \"I've got it! He's yellow!\"Frith, p. 50. Further details that developed his plans came from letters Fender received from Australia in 1932 describing how Australian batsmen were increasingly moving across the stumps towards the off-side to play the ball on the on-side. Fender showed these letters to Jardine. It was also known in England that Bradman had shown some discomfort during the 1931\u201332 Australian season against pace bowling.Frith, pp. 39\u201340, 48."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Rockley Wilson"]}, {"page": "List of International cricket families", "response": ["*Rockley Wilson"]}, {"page": "Percy Fender", "response": ["As an amateur, Fender was not paid for the tour, but some of his expenses were paid by the MCC. However, tours at the time often left many amateurs out of pocket. To offset their costs, Fender and his teammate Rockley Wilson wrote for several newspapers and magazines during the tour. Their comments were unpopular in Australia, particularly in the final Test when Wilson criticised the behaviour of the Australian spectators.McKinstry, p. 197. Fender was barracked several times by the crowds when reports reached Australia of his newspaper columns;Streeton, p. 108. occasionally, the crowds chanted \"Please Go Home Fender\", making a play on his initials. Fender made light of this, joining in by conducting the barrackers.Streeton, p. 99. In subsequent tours, the MCC forbade cricketers from writing about matches in which they were playing.Streeton, p. 103. On his way home, Fender wrote an account of the tour which was published as Defending the Ashes.

Despite this success, Griffin, as a professional, was unable to secure a regular place in cash-strapped Somerset's team, and played only two further matches.

But Australia established their dominance in this match, winning by 377 runs after totalling 581 in their second innings.McKinstry, pp. 194\u201395. In this game, Hobbs had opened with C. A. G. Russell in place of Rhodes, who was out of form.McKinstry, p. 195. For the remainder of the series, Rhodes was restored to partner Hobbs, but they could not replicate their former successes.McKinstry, p. 197. In the third Test, their partnership was ended by a run out for the only time in Tests,Arlott, p. 92. and they had only one stand worth more than 50. Nevertheless, in the second Test Hobbs scored 122 on a very difficult pitch which had been affected by rain. Wisden commented that this was \"from the English point of view, the finest innings of the tour\". Even so, England followed on in reply to Australia's total of 499 and lost by an innings.McKinstry, pp. 195\u201396. Hobbs also scored a century in defeat in the third Test, hitting 123 in the final innings as England failed to score 489 to win the game. Hobbs did not pass 50 again in the series; in the fourth Test, he scored 27 and 13. Then in a match against New South Wales before the final Test, he tore a muscle in his thigh. Persuaded by Douglas to play despite suffering from restricted mobility, Hobbs scored 40 and 34 in the final Test. But after one incident in the field when he struggled to chase the ball, Hobbs was jeered by some of the crowd. Both Fender and another member of the team, Rockley Wilson, wrote scathingly about the incident in their dual role as journalists covering the Tests. Later in the match, the crowd, who gave Wilson a hostile reception following his writing, loudly cheered Hobbs; in Hobbs' view, this was to make amends for the earlier mockery of his hampered fielding.McKinstry, pp. 197\u201398. Hobbs scored a total of 924 first-class runs on the tour, at an average of 51.33; In Test matches, he scored 505 runs at 50.50. Wisden noted in its review of the tour that many English batsmen failed in the Test series, and that \"our batting on the big occasions fell far short of what might reasonably have been expected.
