Vivian Green\u2014a renowned historian and author with an encyclopaedic knowledge. However, other than the thick glasses, loud clothes, and Green's habit of disappearing into a crowd, there were too many dissimilarities between the loquacious Green and the reticent Smiley to make this a clear match, and so other sources for Smiley continued to be named. It has been suggested that le Carr\u00e9 subconsciously took the name of his hero from special forces and intelligence officer Colonel David de Crespigny Smiley. More commonly, it was rumoured that Smiley was modelled on Sir Maurice Oldfield, a former head of British Intelligence, who physically resembled him. Le Carr\u00e9 denied the rumours, citing the fact that Oldfield and he were not contemporaries, although he and Alec Guinness did lunch with Oldfield while Guinness was researching the role, and Guinness adopted several of Oldfield's mannerisms of dress and behaviour for his performance.West, Nigel.

The report established primacy of RUC Special Branch over all areas of intelligence gathering, and the Branch would also absorb weapons and firearms analysis.  All intelligence contacts were to be offered to Special Branch, and all proposed arrests were to be cleared with the Branch. As a \"basic rule\" Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers were not to discuss a Special Branch operation or investigation with other members of CID without express permission from the Branch.  It is claimed by critics that the Walker Report cemented the position of RUC Special Branch as a force within a force, beyond normal checks and balances; established a policy of primacy of intelligence requirements over criminal investigation; led to a perception of informants as an untouchable \"protected species\"; and to an acceptance of cover-up and fabrication of evidence, such as that revealed after the so-called \"shoot-to-kill\" killings by police in 1982, that formed the subject of the Stalker inquiry.Policing the Police, Insight, Ulster TV, 1 May 2001; transcript via Relatives for JusticeRichard Norton-Taylor and Nick Hopkins, Security service told RUC that it could put spying on terrorists ahead of solving crime, The Guardian, 14 June 2001Ian Cobain, Northern Ireland: when Britain fought terror with terror, The Guardian, 9 July 2015Alan Simpson, How Special Branch betrayed the police, The Belfast Telegraph, 5 July 2016Ian Cobain and Owen Bowcott, RUC told to put intelligence before arrests, reveals secret MI5 report, The Guardian, 26 June 2018 The implementing memo became known in 2001; the underlying report itself was declassified in June 2018."]}, {"page": "Lady Manners School", "response": ["* Sir Maurice Oldfield CMG CBE, former director-general \u2013 \"C\" \u2013 from 1973\u201378 of MI6 "]}, {"page": "Colin Wallace", "response": ["On 16 March 1976 the British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, retired suddenly without any apparent reason.
