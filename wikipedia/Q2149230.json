In this show she made her final performance on the West End stage, on 5 October 1974. Her last public appearance was a BBC radio programme With Great Pleasure, a selection of her favourite works, given before an invited audience in August 1976. In The Guardian, Nicholas de Jongh wrote of her evident frailty, \"Yet she can still give the single words and phrases an imperious or serene grandeur, as in her final speaking of Richard Church's poem where she welcomed 'that summoning touch of death our neighbour'.

He felt that he could depict her without any bias as he focused on what was known about her knowledge and religious aspects.Worth 1972 p. 63 Ainsworth was accused of sensationalising violence in his novels; for instance critic Richard Church remarked that Ainsworth \"brought sensationalism and an atmosphere of the Chamber of Horrors into the historical novel\".Ligocki 1972 qtd p. 25 Despite these assertions, Ainsworth was faithful to the sources he worked from. Most of his information was derived from David Jardine's A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England (1837), and details such as the use of the Scavenger's Daughter are based on Jardine's description of torture in the Tudor period. By recounting suffering and torture in The Tower of London, Ainsworth made plain the consequences of failed political intrigue in the Tudor period. Jardine notes that members of the nobility were not tortured; Ainsworth overlooks this with the intention of showing that failure in political machinations came at a high price. In this, Ligocki feels that Ainsworth was true to the nature of the Tudor period, reflecting the \"cruelty and ruthlessness of the politically ambitious of the age\".Ligocki 1972 pp. 25\u201326"]}, {"page": "Half Moon, Herne Hill", "response": ["English writer and poet Richard Church recalls stopping for lunch at The Half Moon Tavern to \"rest the horses\", when moving home from Battersea to Herne Hill as a child in Edwardian era London. \"I sat on the tailboard, and the foreman treated me to a ginger beer and a meat pie.\""]}, {"page": "Richard Church (critic)", "response": ["#redirect Richard Church (poet)"]}]}}
