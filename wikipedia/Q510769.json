Before appearing in the Bond films, he had a long career as a bit-part actor in films and television. He had a starring role in the 1950s television series Ivanhoe where he played Gurth, the faithful companion of Ivanhoe, played by Roger Moore. He had previously made an uncredited appearance as a castle guard in the unrelated 1952 film Ivanhoe. He had an uncredited appearance as the galley-master in Ben-Hur (1959) and as factory worker Bert Harker in the BBC's 1960s soap opera The Newcomers. In One Million Years B.C. (1966), he played grunting caveman Akhoba, brutal head of the barbaric \"Rock tribe\".Brown first started in the James Bond franchise in the film The Spy Who Loved Me as Admiral Hargreaves, appearing alongside Lee. After Lee's death in January 1981, Broccoli and the other producers, decided to leave M out of For Your Eyes Only out of respect for Lee and assigned his lines to M's Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. In 1983, Brown was hired to portray M on the recommendation of Bond actor Roger Moore, his Ivanhoe co-star and the father of Brown's goddaughter Deborah. It was never clearly established if Brown was the same M as Lee's character, or a different M, perhaps a promoted Hargreaves. In 1995, Brown was succeeded as M by Judi Dench in GoldenEye.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Judi Dench", "response": ["After the long period between James Bond films Licence to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995), the producers brought in Dench to take over as the role of M, James Bond's boss. The character was reportedly modeled on Dame Stella Rimington, the real-life head of MI5 between 1992 and 1996; Dench became the first woman to portray M, succeeding Robert Brown. The seventeenth spy film in the series and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer, GoldenEye marked the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided the plot's back story.

Shot mainly in England at Elstree Studios and Buckinghamshire, some of the show was also filmed in California owing to a partnership with Columbia Studios' Screen Gems. Aimed at younger audiences, the pilot was filmed in colour, a reflection of its comparatively high budget for a British children's adventure series of the period, but subsequent episodes were shot in black and white. Christopher Lee and John Schlesinger were among the show's guest stars, and series regulars included Robert Brown (who in the 1980s played M in several James Bond films) as the squire Gurth, Peter Gilmore as Waldo Ivanhoe, Andrew Keir as villainous Prince John, and Bruce Seton as noble King Richard. Moore suffered broken ribs and a battle-axe blow to his helmet while performing some of his own stunts filming a season of 39 half-hour episodes, and later reminisced, \"I felt a complete Charlie riding around in all that armour and damned stupid plumed helmet.

The character is based on Stella Rimington, the real-life head of MI5 between 1992 and 1996. For GoldenEye, Dench's M is cold, blunt and initially dislikes Bond, whom she calls a \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War.\" Tanner, her Chief of Staff, refers to her during the film as \"the Evil Queen of Numbers\", given her reputation at that stage for relying on statistics and analysis rather than impulse and initiative.", "In No Time to Die (2021), Dench's M is briefly seen in a portrait at M's office (Ralph Fiennes) opposite a portrait of Robert Brown's M."]}, {"page": "GoldenEye", "response": ["The film was released after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond; Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. It was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot. Principal photography for GoldenEye took place in the UK, Russia, Monte Carlo and Puerto Rico; it was the inaugural film production to be shot at Leavesden Studios. The first Bond film to use computer-generated imagery (CGI), GoldenEye was also the final film of special effects supervisor Derek Meddings's career, and was dedicated to his memory.", "To replace Dalton, the producers chose Pierce Brosnan, who had been prevented from succeeding Roger Moore in 1986 because of his contract to continue starring in the television series Remington Steele. He was introduced to the public at a press conference at the Regent Palace Hotel on 8 June 1994. Before negotiating with Brosnan, Mel Gibson, Hugh Grant, and Liam Neeson passed on the role. Broccoli and Campbell met Ralph Fiennes about taking the part. Paul McGann was the studio's original choice for it. He would have been cast as Bond only if Brosnan had turned down the role. Brosnan was paid $1.2\u00a0million for the film, out of a total budget of $60\u00a0million. Judi Dench, an English actress, was cast as M replacing Robert Brown, making this the first film of the series featuring a female M. The decision is widely believed to have been inspired by Stella Rimington having become head of MI5 in 1992. The character of Alec Trevelyan was originally scripted as \"Augustus Trevelyan\" and envisaged as an older character and a mentor figure to Bond. Anthony Hopkins and Alan Rickman were reportedly sought for the role but both turned it down. Sean Bean was subsequently cast and the character was rewritten as Bond's peer. John Rhys-Davies was asked to reprise his role as General Pushkin from The Living Daylights but declined, and the character was rewritten into Defense Minister Mishkin."]}, {"page": "Robert Brown", "response": ["Robert Brown may refer to:", "* Washboard Sam or Robert Brown (1910\u20131966), American musician and singer", "* Robert Brown (British actor) (1921\u20132003), British actor, played M in four James Bond films", "* Robert Brown (American actor) (born 1926), American actor, played Jason Bolt in Here Come the Brides", "* Robert Brown (cartoonist) (1936\u20132007), American painter and cartoonist", "* Robert Brown (musician) (born 1970), lead singer of steampunk band Abney Park", "* Robert Brown (North Carolina musician) (born 1983), multi-instrumentalist of his solo project Epignosis", "* Robert Brown (sailor) (fl. 1830\u20131864), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "* Robert Brown (MP for Gloucester), Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester in 1353 and 1358", "* Sir Robert Brown, 1st Baronet, of Westminster (died 1760), British Member of Parliament", "* Robert Brown (Pennsylvania politician) (1744\u20131823), U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania", "* Robert Brown (English politician) (1921\u20131996)", "* Robert Brown (Ohio politician) (1928\u20131985), member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1979 to 1985", "* Robert Brown (Minnesota politician) (1935\u20132020), member of the Minnesota State Senate", "* Robert Brown (Scottish politician) (born 1947)", "* Robert Brown (Georgia politician) (1950\u20132011), Democratic member of the Georgia State Senate", "* Robert Brown (South Carolina politician) (born 1950), member of the South Carolina House of Representatives", "* Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773) (1773\u20131858), Scottish (Montrose) scientist, explorer, author, botanist: R.Br., after whom Brownian motion is named", "* Robert Brown (New Zealand botanist) (c. 1824\u20131906), New Zealand bootmaker and botanist: R.Br.bis", "* Robert Brown (botanist, born 1842) (1842\u20131895), Scottish (Caithness) explorer, scientist, author, botanist: R.Br.ter", "* Robert Brown (plant physiologist) (1908\u20131999), British scientist, Fellow of the Royal Society", "* J.
