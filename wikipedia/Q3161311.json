The same is true for institutional buildings such as the Old Court House and the Customs House designed by John Ostell, the Bonsecours Market and even the Notre-Dame Basillica (whose fa\u00e7ade is the work of an Irish Protestant from New York, James O'Donnell). The only notable exception is the Montreal City Hall, which was inspired by the Hotel de Ville de Rennes. The character of the Victorian style of the late-19th-century buildings was a significant change from the stone masonry used during the French era and affected the appearance of Old Montreal."]}, {"page": "Gothic Revival architecture in Canada", "response": ["In the 18th century, a growing spirit of Romanticism and interest in the Medieval past led to a revival of Gothic styles in Britain. The style made its way to Canada in the early 19th century. One of the first appearances is in an 1811 proposal by Jeffry Wyatt for a new legislature in Quebec City. One of the first major Gothic Revival structures in Canada was Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, which was designed in 1824 by the Irish-American James O'Donnell. The largest church in North America upon its completion, it was one of the first architectural works of international note to be built in Canada. It was also one of the first Catholic Gothic Revival structures, as the movement would not spread from Britain to France and continental Europe until several years later. As the most prominent church in the colony its form was much imitated by local church builders, who constructed miniature versions of the basilica across Quebec."]}, {"page": "James O'Donnell", "response": ["James O'Donnell may refer to:", "*James O'Donnell (architect) (1774\u20131830), architect", "*James O'Donnell (organist) (born 1961), organist of Westminster Abbey", "*James O'Donnell (politician) (1840\u20131915), United States Representative from Michigan", "*James O'Donnell (rugby union) (1860\u20131942), New Zealand rugby player", "*James O'Donnell (sports promoter) (1872\u20131946), American sports promoter and founder of the NFL's Cleveland Tigers"]}, {"page": "Notre-Dame Basilica (Montreal)", "response": ["By 1824 the congregation had completely outgrown the church, and James O'Donnell, an Irish-American Anglican from New York City, was commissioned to design the new building, with a goal of accommodating a congregation of up to 10,000.
