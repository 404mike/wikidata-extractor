He is best known for his work with Cliff Richard and the Shadows, both together and separately, steering their early careers and producing and arranging most of their material from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.

The four members were Harry Webb (by then going under the stage name \"Cliff Richard\"), Ian Samwell on guitar, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar. None of the other three played with the later and better known Shadows, although Samwell wrote songs for Richard's later career.  Agent George Ganjou saw the group perform in London, and recommended them to Norrie Paramor for an audition.Richard Anthony Baker, Old Time Variety: an illustrated history, Pen & Sword, 2011, , p.208", "There are various stories about why the A-side was replaced by the intended B-side. One is that Norrie Paramor's young daughter raved about the B-side; another was that influential TV producer Jack Good, who used the act for his TV show Oh Boy!, wanted the only song on his show to be \"Move It\" as opposed to \"Schoolboy Crush\".Richard himself stated that the latter theory is correct; interviewed for the first episode of the BBC Four programme, Pop Britannia, broadcast on 4 January 2008. Richard was quoted as saying:", "In 1961, EMI records organised Richard's 21st birthday party at its London headquarters in Manchester Square led by his producer Norrie Paramor. Photographs of the celebrations were incorporated into Richard's next album \"21 Today\" in which Tony Meehan joined in despite, then, having very recently left the Shadows to be replaced by Brian Bennett.", "In the early years, particularly on album and EP releases, Richard also recorded ballads backed by the Norrie Paramor Orchestra with Tony Meehan (and later Brian Bennett) as a session drummer. His first such single without the Shadows was When the Girl in Your Arms Is the Girl in Your Heart in 1961, and he continued to release one or two per year, including covers of \"It's All in the Game\" in 1963 and \"Constantly\" in 1964, a revival of a popular Italian hit. In 1965, sessions under the direction of Billy Sherrill in Nashville, Tennessee were particularly successful, yielding \"The Minute You're Gone\", which topped the UK singles chart and \"Wind Me Up (Let Me Go)\" which made No. 2.", "* Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp: music by the Shadows and Norrie Paramor", "* Cinderella: music by the Shadows and Norrie Paramor"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1968", "response": ["* Norrie Paramor"]}, {"page": "Brian Epstein", "response": ["Epstein made numerous trips to London to visit record companies in the hope of securing a record contract, but many rejected him, including Columbia, Pye, Philips, Oriole, and most notoriously Decca. On 13 December 1961, at Epstein's invitation, Mike Smith of Decca travelled from London to Liverpool to watch the group at the Cavern, which led to an audition in London on 1 January 1962 (see The Beatles' Decca audition). Decca informed Epstein one month later that the audition tapes had been rejected. The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan (ex-drummer of the Shadows) to produce the studio recordings. While Epstein was negotiating with Decca he also approached Ron White, an EMI marketing executive, who contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor, Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record the group.

Tim Rice, who was at that time an assistant to their producer Norrie Paramor, also contributed backing vocals to some of their material. Additionally, although not officially credited as a permanent member of the group during its heyday, guitarist Andy Roberts was a frequent musical collaborator from as far back as 1962, acting as musical director and arranger in a live setting throughout their career and playing on a large number of their releases."]}, {"page": "Columbia Graphophone Company", "response": ["Under EMI, UK Columbia's releases were mainly licensed recordings from American Columbia until 1951 when American Columbia switched British distribution to Philips Records. UK Columbia continued to distribute American Columbia sister labels Okeh and Epic until 1968 when American Columbia's then parent CBS moved distribution of all its labels to the new CBS Records created from the purchase of Oriole Records (UK) in late 1964. The loss of American Columbia product had forced UK Columbia to groom its own talent such as Russ Conway, John Barry, Cliff Richard, the Shadows, Helen Shapiro, Frank Ifield, Rolf Harris, Freddie and the Dreamers, the Dave Clark Five, Shirley Bassey, Frankie Vaughan, Des O'Connor, Ken Dodd, the Animals, Herman's Hermits, Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Seekers, the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck, and Pink Floyd.Pink Floyd recorded their first three albums for Columbia Graphophone, then switched to Harvest; some of their recordings for Harvest were leased to the CBS Columbia label.

The song was recorded at EMI Recording Studios, Abbey Road with a nine piece band under the direction of Martin Slavin. After Helen's appearance on the ITV musical programme Thank Your Lucky Stars, the record took off and reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1961. According to AllMusic, Shapiro's rich and mature choice made her \"an extraordinary new phenomenon on the British pop scene.\" Her next single, the ballad \"You Don't Know\", topped the chart in August. The follow-up, \"Walkin' Back to Happiness\", was written written by John Schroeder and Mike Hawker and featured backing orchestrations by Norrie Paramor. The single quickly scaled the top of the chart with far greater sales than her last in October 1961, by which time Shapiro had turned 15. She had initially been reticent to record the song as she considered it old-fashioned and corny. Both of Shapiro's No. 1 singles sold over a million copies, earning her two gold discs. Her mature voice made her an overnight sensation, as well as the youngest female chart topper in the UK.", "The Beatles' first national tour of Britain, in the late winter and early spring of 1963, was as one of her supporting acts. During the course of the tour, John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote the song \"Misery\" for her; but Shapiro's producer, Norrie Paramor, turned it down, and she did not record the composition. In 1995, during an episode of This Is Your Life highlighting her life and career, Shapiro revealed, \"It was actually turned down on my behalf before I ever heard it, actually. I never got to hear it or give an opinion.

They went on to record four singles, including a cover of the 1963 Chubby Checker US hit \"Twenty Miles\", which was a big seller locally but failed to chart nationally. The Columbia releases, although uncredited, were all produced by Bob Barratt, EMI staff producer, with Norrie Paramor as executive. Paramor played the celesta on \"What's The Matter With Me\"; the b-side of \"Twenty Miles\". In 1965, they played a long stint in Germany at the Storyville in Cologne and also in Duisburg. By this time The Gaylords had attained status as one of the top groups in Scotland, borne out in music poll results, but were ambitious, and so on their return from Germany to London in early 1965, they decided to try for success in the UK as a whole, and remained in London, where they changed management and agency representation, as Billy Grainger wished to remain in Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Mark Wirtz", "response": ["In 1967, Wirtz accepted EMI veteran producer/A&R chief Norrie Paramor's offer to join EMI Records as in-house producer.
