She performs on the cl\u00e0rsach and the Camac electroharp, and she sings in English and Gaelic. She has worked with Sting, Kathryn Tickell, Norma Waterson, Donald Hay, the Poozies, and in the duo S\u00ecleas with Patsy Seddon. In 2013, she and Seddon were inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.As an adolescent, Macmaster bought an inexpensive harp that turned out to be wire-strung like the traditional Gaelic cl\u00e0rsach. Lacking instruction in this older kind of harp, she mostly taught herself how to play it. In 1977, she studied at a Cl\u00e0rsach Society summer school, and three years later she pursued Celtic studies at the University of Edinburgh. She recorded one album as a member of the band Sprangeen. She graduated in 1985, and with Patsy Seddon, a fellow student who also a member of Sprangeen, she formed the harp duo S\u00ecleas, which was named for the 18th-century Scottish poet S\u00ecleas na Ceapaich. During the same year, she started playing one of the first models of electric harp made by Jo\u00ebl Garnier. Macmaster has been a member of the folk band, The Poozies since 1990, and is the only remaining founder member.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shine", "response": ["* Shine (Scottish band), folk trio of Alyth McCormack, Corinna Hewat and Mary Macmaster"]}, {"page": "Dick Gaughan", "response": ["By the early 90s Gaughan was again feeling the need to work regularly with others, so he invited seven other well-established Scots musicians to form a group called Clan Alba.
