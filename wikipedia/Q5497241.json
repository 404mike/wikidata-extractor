He was born in Acton Green and died in Harrow, London.Alexander represented Middlesex in two County Championship games during the 1951 season, making his debut against Surrey and following this up with a game against Sussex two weeks later. Alexander was a lower-middle order batsman who also played five games for the team in the Minor Counties Championship, but was unable to score enough runs to secure a permanent place in the side.Alexander also played football as a centre-back, and was on the books of league teams QPR and Charlton Athletic, but never made senior appearances for either.
