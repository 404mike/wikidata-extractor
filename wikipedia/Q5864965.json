On their next attempt, Galaxy quarterback James Brown led his team 8-play, 79-yard drive that ended with Lewis running the ball in from a yard out. The Fire tried to respond with a touchdown, but Frankfurt's defense made them settle for a 39-yard field goal by Todd France. In the second quarter, after the Fire goofed a punt attempt, Frankfurt quarterback Quinn Gray led his team on a 3-play, 15-yard drive and he concluded it with a 10-yard pass to wide receiver Marc Lester. Again, the Fire tried to respond with a touchdown of their own, but again, the Galaxy defense made them settle for another field goal, which was a 31-yarder by Ingo Anderbr\u00fcgge. Afterwards, the Galaxy would quickly respond with a 3-play, 79-yard drive that ended with running back Robert Gillespie running 29 yards for a touchdown. With only two minutes left until halftime, the Fire desperately needed a touchdown to keep up with Frankfurt. At first, their drive showed promise as they started from their own 44-yard line and managed to get to Frankfurt's 9-yard line. Unfortunately, the drive stalled once the Fire got there and they had to settle for 27-yard field goal by Anderbr\u00fcgge. At halftime, the Galaxy had a comfortable 25\u20139 lead over the Fire. In the third quarter, Rhein got the ball to begin the second half and on their opening drive and the Fire managed to get to Frankfurt's 1-yard line. However, they failed to get the ball in on 3rd & goal. Then, on 4th & goal, Fire center Dustin Keith fumbled the ball and Galaxy defensive tackle Daniel Benetka managed to recover the ball, preventing Rhein from another touchdown opportunity. After Benetka got the ball for Frankfurt, Brown lead his team on a 10-play, 99-yard drive that ended with running back Adam Tate running in for a 1-yard touchdown strike. Heading into the fourth quarter, the Fire trailed 32\u20139 and only a miracle could save any hope of Rhein winning another World Bowl title. Alas, the Galaxy would just kick a 34-yard field goal by Ralf Kleinmann to increase their lead and make the score 35\u20139. Even though the Rhein Fire would finally respond with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Chris Greisen to Dwayne Blakely, it was too little, too late for the Fire. When the official clock reached 00:00, the Galaxy celebrated their third World Bowl victory in franchise history."]}, {"page": "Agony (TV series)", "response": ["*Robert Gillespie - Mr. Mince (Series 1)"]}, {"page": "The Thirty Nine Steps (1978 film)", "response": ["* Robert Gillespie as Crombie"]}, {"page": "List of The Professionals episodes", "response": ["| Roger Lloyd-Pack, Ed Bishop, Robert Gillespie, Judy Matheson, Nadim Sawalha, Martin Benson, Peter Cellier, Tony Caunter, Archie Tew, John Hamill", "| Glyn Owen, Pamela Stephenson, Tony Steedman, Robert Gillespie, Neil Hallett, Art Malik, Andy Ho, Martyn Whitby"]}, {"page": "Bonjour la Classe", "response": ["*Robert Gillespie \u2013 Gilbert Herring"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["*Robert Gillespie (Acting Diploma 1953)"]}, {"page": "Brian Cooke", "response": ["Cooke also wrote and created the 1980s TV sitcom Keep It in the Family, starring Robert Gillespie and the late-1960s/early-1970s sitcom Father, Dear Father starring Patrick Cargill.
