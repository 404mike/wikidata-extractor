He joined Newport in June 2009, and helped them to win the Conference South title in 2009\u201310 and to the 2012 FA Trophy Final. He returned to the English Football League with Yeovil Town in July 2012, and played in the club's 2013 League One play-off Final victory that took them into the Championship. He lost his first team place in the 2013\u201314 season and joined Shrewsbury Town on loan, before winning Yeovil's Player of the Year award in the 2014\u201315 season as the club dropped into League Two. He joined Port Vale in June 2015, and left after two seasons to join Northampton Town in May 2017, where he would remain for another two seasons.

The season began in the best possible way at Kettering Town's new Nene Park ground with Elliot Buchanan putting County into a 1\u20130 lead after only six minutes. However hints of the season-to-come's struggles were evident when Kettering scored twice in the second half to lead 2\u20131. Danny Rose immediately equalised to leave the score 2\u20132 until Kettering were awarded a 90th-minute penalty. This was duly converted and County lost 3\u20132. The first home game against Hayes & Yeading was emphatically won 4\u20130, but thereafter began a run of 10 games without victory that cost Anthony Hudson his job. After draws against Grimsby Town and Ebbsfleet United County suffered five straight defeats including a televised 5\u20130 humiliation away at Mansfield Town that pushed County into the relegation zone. In each of the next three games County were on course for victory but succumbed to late goals. At home to Stockport County for the first time since August 1987 Danny Rose had given the home side a 30th-minute lead only for an 81st-minute equaliser for the visitors to deny Newport a win. In the next home game against Barrow County were 2\u20131 up going into injury time but again fell to a 90th-minute penalty, drawing 2\u20132. Away to Forest Green Rovers County were winning 1\u20130 only for former County player Charlie Griffin to equalise and yet another game was drawn. This was to prove to be Hudson's last game in charge. With a miserable return of only five points from their last ten games and County lying in last-but-one place in the table he was sacked the next day. Assistant manager Lee Harrison took charge for the next game away at Darlington who themselves were in a bad run of form, but County's miserable run continued. Two first half goals for the home side helped them to their first win in seven games with County remaining rooted in the relegation zone four points from safety. Justin Edinburgh was announced as the new manager on 4 October with the job of saving County from relegation. The enormity of the task was revealed in his first game in charge at home to Southport with three first-half goals condemning County to yet another defeat. The next game away to promotion hopefuls Fleetwood Town began with the home side taking the lead within 52 seconds. However a rout was avoided and against all the odds County eventually ran out 4\u20131 winners with Sam Foley scoring a hat-trick. This most unlikely of victories was only the second of 15 games so far in the season. After a 2\u20131 defeat at Tamworth revenge was extracted on Kettering Town in a 3\u20131 home victory with Danny Rose scoring a hat-trick. After a 0\u20130 draw at Wrexham and a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Ebbsfleet United County travelled to Blundell Park to face Grimsby Town. After being 2\u20130 up inside 17 minutes County again fell to late goals, with Serge Makofo scoring in the 79th minute and Anthony Elding converting an 87th-minute penalty. At home against Luton Town County looked on course to get a point from a 0\u20130 draw but yet again were undone by a late goal with Danny Crow scoring in the 2nd minute of stoppage time. In the next game at Woking's Kingfield Stadium County achieved a second 4\u20130 victory over Hayes & Yeading which finally lifted them out of the relegation zone on goal difference. This was followed the first visit of Lincoln City since the Third Division match of March 1986. This match was won 1\u20130 and County leapfrogged City into 18th place in the table. In the next game at home to 23rd-placed Alfreton Town County's record of conceding late goals continued. After leading from an Eliott Buchanan goal in the 4th minute County were 2\u20131 behind by the 28th minute. A Gary Warren equaliser in the 60th minute looked to have achieved a point for County, but an 89th-minute winner gave Alfreton just their second win in 14 games. With the proposed Boxing Day fixture at home to Bath City a victim of the weather the last game of 2011 was the home fixture against high-flying Fleetwood Town. Fleetwood maintained their charge at the top of the table with a 75th-minute winner but County saw out the end of the year outside the relegation zone.", "The new year began with the short away trip to bottom-placed Bath City. County again took an early lead through Nat Jarvis in the 13th minute but lost the game 3\u20132 to give Bath only their third victory of the season. That loss pushed County back to the brink of the relegation zone, only staying out on goal difference. Away to Luton Town County lost 2\u20130 after debutant Ryan Charles was sent off after 32 minutes. After a home 0\u20130 draw with Forest Green Rovers County made the long trip to Gateshead. Finding themselves 2\u20130 down after 53 minutes Elliot Buchanan pulled a goal back in the 57th minute. As the game drew to a close another County defeat looked likely. However County were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute. Sam Foley's spot-kick was initially saved but he was quick to tap in the rebound. The comeback was complete in the 94th minute when substitute Jake Harris scored a 20-yard winner. Despite the victory County had now slipped back into the relegation zone. County's next game saw a return to Stockport County's Edgeley Park for the first time since January 1988. Finding themselves 1\u20130 behind after just seven minutes Andy Sandell equalised in the 50th minute before being sent off just eight minutes later. After Daniel Rowe grabbed his second of the game just minutes later the hosts were back in front with Newport a man down. As the clock ticked towards full-time Jake Harris scored the equaliser in the 87th minute having only been on the pitch for nine minutes. The next game saw a 1\u20130 revenge victory at home over Bath City. County had now left the relegation zone and leapt four places to 17th in the table. The following game saw another 1\u20130 revenge victory, this time against high-flying Mansfield Town. That victory took County to 16th in the table \u2013 the highest they had been since August. In the next game away at Tamworth County took an early lead through a 6th-minute Sam Foley penalty. As the game entered the final minutes this looked to be the third straight County victory but Tamworth equalised in the 83rd minute. Two minutes later and the hosts had won it, the final score a 2\u20131 County defeat. After an away 1\u20131 draw at Southport County were at home to mid-table Braintree Town. After only seven minutes on the clock Lee Minshull was sent off. County eventually lost 4\u20133 having played 83 minutes of normal time and 12 minutes of stoppage time with only ten men. By this point in the season County knew they had made the FA Trophy Final at Wembley but were still in danger of relegation. Away at Cambridge United County trailed 1\u20130 until Andy Sandell scored a penalty five minutes from time to earn County a 1\u20131 draw. Next up was a first trip to Lincoln City's Sincil Bank since the Third Division encounter in October 1985. The game was lost 2\u20130 and County found themselves just one place and one point above the relegation zone. County achieved their second double of the season in the next game, beating Gateshead 1\u20130 at home, but were still only one place and one point above relegation. The next game was the first of the three encounters with promotion hopefuls York City. County won 2\u20131. The third home game in a week resulted in a 0\u20130 draw against Telford United to take seven points out of the nine available. Away to Kidderminster Harriers Jake Reid scored for County within 10 seconds of kick-off and Sam Foley doubled the lead on 36 minutes. With full-time approaching Elliot Buchanan gave away a penalty in the 86th minute. Substitute Nick Wright duly converted it and full-time was up. However, in a disastrous spell of injury time Wright scored Kidderminster's equaliser in the 93rd minute and then the winner in the 95th minute for his hat-trick. The next game was the second of three games against York City. County again started well with Nat Jarvis scoring in the 4th minute. York equalised in the 59th minute and the game ended a 1\u20131 draw. County now knew that they only needed a point against relegated Darlington to secure league safety barring some statistically improbable results elsewhere. That point came with a 0\u20130 draw. Any doubts that County were now safe were extinguished by the following 1\u20130 victory over Alfreton Town. Manager Justin Edinburgh had achieved his aim of avoiding relegation. The final two league games of the season, results now immaterial, were a home 1\u20130 loss to second-placed Wrexham and a 3\u20131 loss to Barrow.", "County started this season's FA Cup in the 4th qualifying round at home to fellow Conference Premier team Braintree Town. The teams had previously met in the league when County had suffered their fifth straight defeat. This game provided a total of seven goals: The first came when former County loan player Ben Wright put the visitors ahead in the 9th minute. Sam Foley equalised for County in the 25th minute before Craig McAllister put the hosts ahead in the 54th minute. Andy Yiadom equalised for Braintree, making it 2\u20132 on 67 minutes before Nat Jarvis put County back ahead in the 76th minute. As the game entered the last five minutes it seemed likely that County would progress into the First Round proper for the first time since 2006, however Braintree equalised yet again with captain Kenny Davis' 20-yard strike in the 86th minute. With a replay looking inevitable Paul Rodgers won it for County in the 89th minute with a 45-yard cross that found its way into the visitor's net.", "The third-round game against Carshalton Athletic was won 4\u20130. Sam Foley opened the scoring in the 4th minute, with Elliott Buchanan adding the second in the 35th minute.

A 0\u20130 draw against Portsmouth at Fratton Park followed five days later. A game of very few goalscoring opportunities, Stevenage striker Marcus Haber had the best chance of the match, hitting the crossbar with a header in injury-time. A week later, Stevenage fell to a 2\u20130 home defeat by promotion-chasing Yeovil Town, with second-half goals from Sam Foley and James Hayter securing the win for the visitors. Another defeat followed a week later as Stevenage came up against another team chasing promotion, losing 3\u20130 to Swindon Town at the County Ground. Swindon took the lead through Aden Flint's volley after twenty minutes, before the visitors had Dani Lopez sent-off for a clash with Swindon midfielder Alan McCormack. Swindon winger Gary Roberts added a second shortly after the interval, before Flint scored his second of the game to round off a comfortable win. The season ended with a 2\u20130 home defeat by MK Dons on 27 April. The away side took the lead ten minutes before half-time when Patrick Bamford headed in Shaun Williams' cross.

The squad was joined by five players who were signed during the off season, former Bristol City and Scotland international full-back Jamie McAllister, released Oldham Athletic duo Keanu Marsh-Brown and Reuben Reid, former Doncaster Rovers forward James Hayter and attacking midfielder Sam Foley after he rejected a new contract with Conference side Newport County. Midfielder Michael Woods was invited back for pre-season training after a non-contract spell at the end of last season, but did not return and Oxford City full-back James Clarke was also invited for a pre-season trial. The first day of pre-season saw the signing of versatile left sided player Nathan Ralph following his release from Peterborough United and former Northampton Town winger Lewis Young. These two new players were supplemented by trialists including Clarke, Canadian goalkeeper Lucas Birnstingl, former Kilmarnock midfielder Ross Lindsay and former Southampton trainee Aarran Racine. On 4 July 2012, despite being half way through his two-year contract defender Bondz N'Gala left the club for fellow League One side Stevenage.

Trialist James Clarke returned to the club after injury and in a high scoring encounter Yeovil triumphed 5\u20133 courtesy of a brace from James Hayter, and goals from Ince, Sam Foley and Gozie Ugwu. Later in the week the side embarked on a team\u2013building white water rafting exercise, before their second friendly against Conference side Newport County. The match allowed a return to Newport for Sam Foley, as Yeovil's good pre\u2013season form continued with a 3\u20131 victory courtesy of goals from Reid, Nathan Ralph and Gozie Ugwu. Following the match, Johnson announced the departure of final trialist James Clarke after failing to earn a contract. Following the lack of interest in a new shirt sponsorship deal, the players were convinced by manager Gary Johnson to take part in a topless photo call to fuel interest. On 7 August, Yeovil faced their only pre\u2013season match against higher league opposition in the shape of Premier League side Stoke City. Yeovil took the lead through a Reuben Reid penalty with Stoke equalising through a Kenwyne Jones header nine minutes later and the match finished 1\u20131. With national press coverage for the squad photo publicity stunt, on 10 August, the club announced a deal had been agreed with W+S Recycling to be the club's new shirt sponsor, and on the same day it was announced that local Italian restaurant chain Tamburino's had agreed a deal to have their logo on the rear of Yeovil's shirts. Yeovil completed their pre\u2013season preparation the following day with a 2\u20132 draw against Exeter City with goals from Upson and Reid, pre\u2013season finished with an unbeaten record in all nine matches with five victories and four draws, scoring 23 goals and conceding just nine.", "Despite a 2\u20131 over Doncaster Rovers, courtesy of goals from Hayter and Ugwu, Yeovil dropped to second in the league table on goal difference. The performance of centre back Richard Hinds saw him named in the Football League One Team of the Week for the second time in three weeks. The Football League Trophy match against Bristol Rovers saw a sluggish performance from Yeovil but despite a red card for captain Jamie McAllister, for an off the ball incident with former team-mate David Clarkson, Yeovil won 3\u20130 with two goals from free-kicks from Ed Upson and a first goal for Sam Foley proving the difference. The club also received a team performance of the round award for their victory over Bristol Rovers. On 8 September, on Soccer AM, Yeovil were drawn away against Torquay United in the second round of the Football League Trophy, later in the day saw a tired performance in the club's first league defeat 1\u20130 at home against Bournemouth. On 15 September, Norwich City midfielder Korey Smith joined Yeovil on an emergency loan deal for the maximum period of 93 days, he made his debut as a substitute that afternoon in the 1\u20130 away defeat against MK Dons as Yeovil slipped to a second consecutive defeat. The following Tuesday saw Yeovil travel to play Leyton Orient and with a frail defensive display Yeovil suffered a heavy 4\u20131 defeat, with the only positive a first league goal for Sam Foley and slipped to 11th in the table. On 21 September, versatile full\u2013back Joe Edwards, who had a loan spell with the club last season, resigned from Bristol City on loan. Yeovil's dismal form continued with another home defeat this time a 1\u20130 reverse against Sheffield United, on 22 September. On 25 September, Rohan Ince returned to Chelsea following an unsuccessful loan spell, but signed 6\u00a0ft 6in defender Dan Burn from Fulham on a youth loan deal for an initial month . Despite taking a sixth minute lead through a Gavin Williams penalty against Preston North End more poor defending and the sending off of midfielder Ed Upson led to a second half turnaround and a 3\u20132 defeat, with debutante Dan Burn scoring at both ends. This defeat saw Yeovil finish the month of September setting a new unwanted club record in the Football League for most consecutive defeats.", "Yeovil's dismal run of form continued into October, and despite a Reuben Reid penalty the club suffered a 2\u20131 home defeat against Portsmouth, their sixth consecutive defeat as the club slid to 16th in the League One table. The game proved more costly for Yeovil than merely a defeat with injuries to both Lewis Young, ankle ligament damage and Gozie Ugwu, recurrence of a hamstring injury, ruling them both out for the month of October, in an attempt to arrest this run of form and as cover for those injuries, on 4 October, Gary Johnson completed the loan signing of Republic of Ireland U21 striker Paddy Madden from Carlisle United. The move worked with immediate effect with Madden scoring a brace on his debut and Hayter adding a third in a 3\u20131 victory over Colchester United. The poor run of form though was reflected by the Colchester United match being the club's lowest ever Football League attendance of just 3,002. This improved performance led to a double nomination in the Football League's Team of the Week with Irish duo Madden and winger Sam Foley both represented. On 9 October, Yeovil's away Football League Trophy tie against Torquay United was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Plainmoor, with the match rescheduled for the following week on the following Saturday the winner of the tie was given the reward of a home Area Quarter-final tie against Wycombe Wanderers in the next round. Another encouraging performance away at league leaders Tranmere Rovers saw Yeovil take a 2\u20130 lead after half an hour thanks to goals from Madden and Foley, but another second half collapse saw Tranmere comeback to win the game 3\u20132 with Yeovil's plight not aided by having Joe Edwards sent off for two yellow cards. In their rearranged tie on 16 October, Yeovil salvaged a 2\u20132 draw against Torquay United with a stoppage time equaliser from James Hayter, to add to his earlier goal, with Yeovil winning the tie 5\u20134 on penalties, having scored all five of their spot kicks and keeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch having saved Torquay's Thomas Cruise's effort. The victory confirming Yeovil's progress to the Area Quarter-final stage of the Football League Trophy, for the first time in five years, with a home tie against Wycombe Wanderers. An unconvincing 2\u20131 victory over a ten-man Bury followed courtesy of goals from Byron Webster and Foley, the performance of midfielder Korey Smith earned him recognition in the League One Team of the Week. That weekend in the draw for the FA Cup First Round Proper Yeovil were given an away tie against fellow League One side Preston North End, to be played on 3 November. On 23 October, with injuries continuing to hamper the squad young Jamaican-born midfielder Daniel Johnson joined the club on a month-long youth loan deal from Aston Villa. That evening Yeovil strolled to a 3\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a brace from Paddy Madden and a goal from top scorer Hayter who took his tally for the season to seven, Daniel Johnson made his debut as a second-half substitute but had the ignominy of giving away a penalty. Yeovil ended the month with a third consecutive victory this time a 1\u20130 away win against Crewe Alexandra thanks to a second goal in a week for defender Byron Webster, the result was also only Yeovil's second clean sheet in the League that season. After a two-month loan spell at AFC Wimbledon, defender Curtis Haynes-Brown returned to the club having made six appearances for the Dons. Webster's winning goal and the club's second league clean sheet of the season led to his inclusion in the Football League's Team of the Week.", "Yeovil began the month with a home Football League Trophy tie against Football League Two side Wycombe Wanderers, courtesy of first-half goals from midfielders Ed Upson and Sam Foley Yeovil recorded a comfortable 2\u20130 victory.

The same day Yeovil faced Notts County at home and despite multiple chances and saves forced from visiting keeper Bartosz Bia\u0142kowski were forced to be content with a 0\u20130 draw. Manager Gary Johnson announced after the match that Watford defender Dale Bennett had returned to his parent club a month early after just one substitute appearance due to a back injury. On 15 December, Yeovil faced an away game against Walsall and recovered from 2\u20130 down to draw thanks to a goal from substitute Reuben Reid and a last minute equaliser from Sam Foley. For the Football League Trophy tie with Leyton Orient in January the club offer fans free transport to the match in an attempt to get 500 away travelling supporters, with these coaches funded by the chairman John Fry, joint owner Norman Hayward, directors, vice-presidents, manager Gary Johnson and the playing squad. On 22 December, despite conceding the opening goal in only the third minute against Oldham Athletic the team turned the game around thanks to two goals from Gavin Williams, the second a superb 30-yard strike, and two late goals from Hayter and Madden seeing Yeovil to a 4\u20131 victory their largest home victory of the season. Yeovil's Boxing Day fixture saw them face a short trip to Bournemouth without Foley with a hamstring injury and Korey Smith and Joe Edwards both of whom had returned to their parent clubs due to their loan spells having been completed, a stretched squad suffered a 3\u20130 reverse. Following the game Johnson confirmed that the January transfer window would see an overhaul of the squad with the hope of helping Yeovil move up the table in the second half of the season, Johnson confirmed two of these signing would be likely to be the permanent acquisition of Paddy Madden and the signing of Irish trialist Kevin Dawson.

Present at the game were two trialists captain of Middlesbrough under\u201321 side's Matthew Dolan and former Chelsea trainee Aliu Djal\u00f3 with a view to them signing on loan and permanently respectively in the January transfer window. Defender Byron Webster received recognition for his goal and impressive performance in the League One Team of the Week.", "Yeovil began the month with a crucial home fixture against fellow play-off chasers Tranmere Rovers, Yeovil won the game 1\u20130 thanks to a well-executed free-kick from Ed Upson overtaking Tranmere in the process up to fifth place in the League One table. Ed Upson's fifth goal of the season was enough to see him included in the League One Team of the Week for the second time this season. Following the game it was reported that The Football Association were investigated an incident at the end of the match between Yeovil captain Jamie McAllister and Tranmere winger and former Yeovil player Abdulai Bell-Baggie, with the papers claiming that Bell-Baggie had been racially abused by McAllister. Manager Gary Johnson told the BBC that captain Jamie McAllister was \"upset\" to be the subject of an inquiry by the Football Association, and would deny any allegations against him. On 9 March, Yeovil played out a goalless draw away at relegation threatened Hartlepool United. On 11 March, Yeovil signed ex-Chelsea full-back and left sided player Ben Gordon on one-month contract as cover for captain Jamie McAllister. Gordon made his full debut the following day replacing the injured Sam Foley, despite taking a two-goal lead after just 18 minutes thanks to goals from Byron Webster and top goalscorer Paddy Madden, a second half turnaround from Crawley Town rescued them a 2\u20132 draw and ended Yeovil's seven game home winning run.

On 23 March, Yeovil faced Carlisle United at Brunton Park despite leading 3\u20131 with seconds left of normal time courtesy of a first goal for Yeovil from Kevin Dawson and goals from Paddy Madden and James Hayter, they conceded two late goals to draw 3\u20133. On 26 March, Queens Park Rangers left winger and striker \u00c1ngelo Balanta joined the club on loan until the end of the season to provide attacking cover at the club. Kevin Dawson's performance in the Carlisle game was enough to earn him a second nomination of the season to the Football League Team of the Week. On 27 March, Matthew Dolan unexpectedly returned to the club on loan from Middlesbrough until the end of the season, and the following day it was confirmed Reuben Reid would remain at Plymouth Argyle on loan until the end of the season as well. Yeovil played fellow play-off chasers Walsall at home on Good Friday, but both sides lacked attacking quality as a game of few chances ended goalless. The result meant Yeovil had won just one of their last eight games but still remained seventh just a point outside the play-off positions.", "Yeovil began April, with an Easter Monday fixture away at Notts County, Yeovil claimed a crucial 2\u20131 victory which reinvigorated their play-off aspirations courtesy of goals from topscorer Paddy Madden and a quality free-kick from Middlesbrough loanee Matthew Dolan on his first start of his second loan spell. On 4 April, the club announced that it would axe its youth academy at the end of the season, citing expense and a lack of progress on a proposed Huish Park development plan as reasons.
