He cut short a degree course at the University of Cambridge to do so. He served in North Africa where he won the Military Cross and was taken prisoner.  Simpkin was awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his part in the new design of the Chieftain tank and retired from the army in 1971. He continued to write, lecture and consult about armor doctrine, tactics and Soviet thinking, living at first in Norfolk, England where he was brought up and then in Elgin, Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of military writers", "response": ["* Richard Simpkin \u2013 military theorist"]}, {"page": "Mikhail Tukhachevsky", "response": ["Tukhachevsky is often credited with the theory of deep operation in which combined arms formations strike deep behind enemy lines to destroy the enemy's rear and logistics,Richard Simpkin in association with John Erickson Deep battle: the brainchild of Marshal Tukhachevskii, London, Brassey's Defence, 1987 Alexander Vasilevsky The Case of All My Life (\u0414\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438). 3d ed. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1978 Chapter8   but his exact role is unclear and disputed because of shortage of firsthand sources, and his published works containing only limited amounts of theory on the subject.

They were expressed as a concept in the Red Army's Field Regulations of 1929 and more fully developed in 1935's Instructions on Deep Battle. The concept was finally codified into the army in 1936 in the Provisional Field Regulations of 1936. An early example of potential effectiveness of deep operations can be found in the Soviet victory over Japan at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan), where a Soviet Corps under the command of Georgy Zhukov defeated a substantial Japanese force in August and September 1939."]}, {"page": "Maneuver warfare", "response": ["* Richard Simpkin in association with John Erickson  Deep Battle: The Brainchild of Marshal Tukhachevskii, London, Brassey's Defence, 1987.

Seriously, Brig Richard Simpkin in the 1980s and Ralph Peters in the 1990s (The War in 2020) have both seriously proposed flying tanks/lo-hover armoured helicopters - imagine a Wing In Ground-effect vehicle armoured version of the Mi-24 and you'll get an idea of how formidable such a vehicle could be. Could have er, taken off, pardon the pun, if the Central Front confrontation had continued for a longer period.
