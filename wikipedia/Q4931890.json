Bob Bowes played the headmaster Mr Gryce in the adaptation of Barry Hines' novel \"A Kestrel for a Knave\", in which a teenage boy from Barnsley, Yorkshire, Billy Casper, finds and trains a young kestrel and in doing so develops a sense of self-respect and discovers his individuality.\nThe character of Gryce - known behind his back as \"Gryce pudding\" to his pupils, is severe, perfunctory and abrupt. He appears constantly in a temper, and does not listen, inflicting punishment even on a boy who has simply been sent to convey a message to him by another teacher. In contrast to the pastoral approach shown by the teacher Mr Farthing - portrayed in the film by Colin Welland, he shows no interest in Billy as a pupil or faith in him as a future member of society (\"heaven help your future employer\"), and regards the young people of the school as being of little worth. At a time when grammar schools were considered superior, the character of Gryce, head of a secondary modern school, emerges as a frustrated and rather pathetic character. One critic has described Bowes' portrayal of him as \"comically vicious...a twentieth-century update of Wackford Squeers, the appalling Yorkshire headmaster of Dotheboys Hall in Nicholas Nickleby\", and in subsequent performances of the play actors playing Gryce have tended to remain close to presentation of the character by Bowes.", "link_mentions": {}}}
