He stood again in the 2005 general election and lost by over 4,000 votes, but the seat became vacant within a month on the death of MP Patsy Calton. Day was the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election, but lost to Liberal Democrat candidate, Mark Hunter.  As a result, Day announced that he would not be the Conservative candidate at the next general election.\nDay is also Secretary of the Association of Conservative Clubs (ACC) and is prominent within the Conservative Clubs movement in the United Kingdom.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Stephen Day"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Stephen Day"]}, {"page": "Patsy Calton", "response": ["She was first elected at the 2001 general election, with a 33-vote majority over the sitting Conservative MP Stephen Day.
