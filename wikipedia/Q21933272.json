On 7 December, he joined National League club Chester on an initial one-month loan. \"Blues\" manager Marcus Bignot signed Hornby to provide competition for Alex Lynch, following the departure of back-up goalkeeper Nathan Vaughan. Having established himself in the \"Seals\" first-team, the loan deal was initially extended by a further month, and then until the end of the 2017\u201318 season.

He got his chance to stake a first-team place under Aspin after Boot picked up an injury at the start of April. He played well in the end of season run-in to help the club to avoid relegation, leading Aspin to say that \"now he has proved a point and now he puts himself in a really good position to compete for the number one jersey next season.\""]}]}}
