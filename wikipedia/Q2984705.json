She wrote six books that are described as \"marriage problem\" novels. Her works sold poorly, sometimes only a few hundred copies. Her last novel, Uncle Hilary, is considered her best. She wrote two plays in collaboration with Florence Farr.\nOlivia was the daughter of a retired Adjutant General, and had little formal education. She was well-read however, and developed a love of literature. In 1885 she married London barrister Henry Hope Shakespear, and in 1886 gave birth to their only child, Dorothy. In 1894 her literary interests led to a friendship with William Butler Yeats that became physically intimate in 1896. He declared that they \"had many days of happiness\" to come, but the affair ended in 1897. They nevertheless remained lifelong friends and corresponded frequently. Yeats went on to marry Georgie Hyde-Lees, Olivia's step-niece and Dorothy's best friend.\nOlivia began hosting weekly salons frequented by Ezra Pound and other modernist writers and artists in 1909, and became influential in London literary society. Olivia's daughter Dorothy Shakespear married Pound in 1914, despite the less than enthusiastic blessing of her parents. After their marriage, Pound would use funds received from Olivia to support T. S. Eliot and James Joyce. When Dorothy gave birth to a son, Omar Pound, in France in 1926, Olivia assumed guardianship of the boy. He lived with Olivia until her death twelve years later, in 1938.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. B.

Yeats proposed to Gonne three more times: in 1899, 1900 and 1901. She refused each proposal, and in 1903, to his dismay, married the Irish nationalist Major John MacBride. His only other love affair during this period was with Olivia Shakespear, whom he first met in 1894, and parted from in 1897.", "That September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees (1892\u20131968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear.

Their marriage was a success, in spite of the age difference, and in spite of Yeats's feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, Anne and Michael. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband \"When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.\"Brown, Terence.

The two volumes and their poems share the complementary symbols of Thoor Ballylee and the winding stair within. Six of the poems in the latter volume were written before the publication of the former, therefore they are often discussed as a single unit. In a complete turnaround from his bleak outlook of eternity expressed in his previous volume (which the poet admitted that he was 'astonished at its bitterness'), Yeats now ponders over the possibility and desire of reincarnation after death. Yeats was in poor health during this period; In a letter to Olivia Shakespeare, Yeats admitted that 'Perhaps if [he] was in better health [he] should be content to be bitter'. Though this volume includes more poems than The Tower, its contents are generally less well-known and thus less frequently anthologized.
