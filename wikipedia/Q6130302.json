Leach sent three commissioners to Milan to interrogate Caroline's former servants, including Theodore Majocchi and Caroline's maid, Louise Demont.Robins, pp. 76\u201377 In London, Brougham was still acting as Caroline's agent. Concerned that the \"Milan commission\" might threaten Caroline, he sent his brother James to Caroline's villa in the hope of establishing whether George had any grounds for divorce. James wrote back to his brother of Caroline and Pergami, \"they are to all appearances man and wife, never was anything so obvious.\"Letter from James Brougham to his brother Henry, quoted in Robins, p. 79 The Milan commission was assembling more and more evidence, and by 1819 Caroline was worried. She informed James Brougham that she would agree to a divorce in exchange for money.Robins, p. 79 However, at this time in England divorce by mutual consent was illegal; it was only possible to divorce if one of the partners admitted or was found guilty of adultery. Caroline said it was \"impossible\" for her to admit that, so the Broughams advised that only formal separation was possible.Robins, p. 80 Both keen to avoid publicity, the Broughams and the Government discussed a deal where Caroline would be called by a lesser title, such as \"Duchess of Cornwall\" rather than \"Princess of Wales\". As the negotiations continued at the end of 1819, Caroline travelled to France, which gave rise to speculation that she was on her way back to England. In January 1820, however, she made plans to return to Italy, but then on 29 January 1820 King George III died. Caroline's husband became king and, at least nominally, she was queen of the United Kingdom.Robins, p. 82"]}, {"page": "Pains and Penalties Bill 1820", "response": ["The defence opened on 3 October, with a speech from Brougham. His speech was considered the \"most magnificent display of argument and oratory that has been heard in years\", quoted in  \"one of the most powerful orations that ever proceeded from human lips\", quoted in  and \"one of the most magnificent speeches ever made in this or any other country\".Letter from William Vizard, Queen Caroline's solicitor, to James Brougham, (RA Geo/11/3, bundle 37) quoted in  According to Thomas Creevey, it astonished and shook the aristocracy. quoted in  In it, Brougham threatened to reveal facts about George's own life, even if they damaged the country, if it was the only way to ensure justice for his client. He attacked the character of the prosecution witnesses, and claimed that Italian witnesses could be purchased like a commodity. He read from a letter from an Italian correspondent, \"There is nothing at Naples so notorious as the free and public sale of false evidence. Their ordinary tariff is three or four ducats.\" He reminded the Lords that Majocchi was forgetful, that Demont was a liar, and that Cuchi was a lecherous wretch who spied on his female guests through a keyhole. He produced a letter from George to Caroline written in 1796, which became known as the \"letter of licence\". It appeared to forgive any transgressions on either Caroline or his part, and allow them to lead separate lives. \"Our inclinations are not in our power,\" George had written, \"nor should either of us be held accountable to the other.\""]}, {"page": "Brougham", "response": ["* James Brougham (1780\u20131833), British politician"]}, {"page": "Kendal (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Brougham"]}, {"page": "Tregony (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Brougham"]}, {"page": "Downton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"| James Brougham"]}, {"page": "Winchelsea (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Brougham"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1832\u20131847)", "response": ["|James Brougham"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1818\u20131832)", "response": ["|15 July 1831||Winchelsea||u*||Stephen Lushington||James Brougham||Chose to sit for Ilchester", "|20 July 1831||Downton||u||James Brougham||Philip Pleydell Bouverie||Resignation to contest Winchelsea", "|31 July 1832||Winchelsea||u||James Brougham||James Brougham||Clerk of Patents and Registrar of Affidavits at the Court of Chancery"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Downton(two members)||James Brougham||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Downton(two members)||James Brougham||Whig", "|Stephen LushingtonChose to sit for Ilchester and replaced 15 July 1831 by James Brougham||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Brougham||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of ministerial by-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|31 July 1832||Winchelsea||u||James Brougham||James Brougham||Clerk of Patents and Registrar of Affidavits at the Court of Chancery"]}, {"page": "Brougham, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Brougham"]}]}}
