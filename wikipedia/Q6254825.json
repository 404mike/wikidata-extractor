His first-class career for Derbyshire began in the 1878 season in a game against the All-England Eleven, a match in which he took two wickets for the team, although his batting contribution, being caught for a duck in the first innings and finishing not-out for 0 in the second, was minimal. He played minor games for Derbyshire in 1878 and 1879. In the 1882 season Richardson played his first County match, against Lancashire. He took at least a wicket in every match he played in the 1882 season. Derbyshire dispensed with the idea of using just two bowlers, most frequently William Mycroft and John Platts at that time, and in his final game of the 1882 season against Yorkshire Richardson achieved his best bowling performance of 7-76. He also made his top score of 18.\nIn the 1883 season Richardson took at least one wicket in every innings except one, although with frequent follow-ons there was often only one chance to bowl. His batting contribution remained low.\nRichardson was a right-arm fast bowler and took 32 first-class wickets at an average of 16.15  and a best performance of 7-76. He was a right-handed batsman who played 21 innings in 11 first-class matches with a top score of 18 and an average of 6.88.Richardson died in Brimington aged 83.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Richardson", "response": ["John Richardson may refer to:", "*John Richardson (translator) (1564\u20131625), Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, 1615\u20131625", "*John Richardson (orientalist) (1740/1\u20131795), Oxford editor of A Dictionary; Persian, Arabic and English, 1777", "*John Richardson (philosopher) (born 1951), professor of philosophy at New York University", "*John Richardson (1766\u20131836), actor who founded the travelling Richardson's Theatre in 1798", "*John Richardson (actor) (1934\u20132021), English actor", "*John Richardson (art historian) (1924\u20132019), art historian, Picasso biographer", "*John Richardson (author) (1796\u20131852), Canadian novelist", "*John Richardson (drummer) (born 1964), American rock drummer from Illinois", "*Jayadev (musician) (John Richardson, born 1947), drummer, original member of The Rubettes", "*John Richardson (poet) (1817\u20131886), English poet", "*John Richardson (special effects designer) (born 1946), British designer of visual effects", "*John Richardson (businessman) (c. 1754\u20131831), Canadian businessman", "*John Richardson (colonial administrator) (1679\u20131741), Deputy Governor of Anguilla", "*John Richardson (New Zealand politician) (1810\u20131878), Speaker of the New Zealand Legislative Council, 1868\u20131879", "*John Richardson (New South Wales politician) (1810\u20131888), Australian pastoralist, store keeper and politician", "*John Richardson (Ontario MPP) (1844\u20131915), Ontario farmer and politician", "*John Richardson (born 1886) (1886\u20131976), American attorney and political figure", "*John Richardson (Canadian MP) (1932\u20132010), Canadian politician", "*John Richardson (Australian politician) (born 1938), member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly", "*John Richardson Jr. (1921\u20132014), US Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs (1969\u20131977)", "*John Richardson (Derbyshire cricketer) (1856\u20131940), English cricketer for Derbyshire County Cricket Club", "*John Richardson (tennis) (1873\u2013?), South African Olympic tennis player", "*John Richardson (Yorkshire cricketer) (1908\u20131985), English cricketer for Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "*John Richardson (South African cricketer) (born 1935), South African cricketer for North Eastern Transvaal ", "*John Richardson (American football) (born 1945), American football player for the Miami Dolphins", "*John Richardson (baseball), American baseball player", "*John Richardson (footballer, born 1949) (1949\u20131984), English football player for Brentford, Fulham and Aldershot", "*John Richardson (footballer, born 1966), English football player for Colchester", "*John Richardson (rower) (born 1944), Canadian rower who competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics", "*John Richardson (bishop of Ardagh) (1580\u20131654), English bishop of the Church of Ireland", "*John Richardson (Quaker) (1667\u20131753), English Quaker minister and autobiographer", "*John Richardson (Archdeacon of Southwark) (1817\u20131904), Anglican priest", "*John Richardson (Archdeacon of Nottingham) (1849\u20131924), priest in the Church of England", "*John Richardson (archbishop of Fredericton) (1868\u20131938), Anglican Church of Canada bishop", "*John Richardson (bishop of Car Nicobar) (1896\u20131978), Anglican bishop in India, also M.P.", "*John Richardson (bishop of Bedford) (born 1937), Church of England bishop", "*John Richardson (Dean of Bradford) (born 1950), priest in the Church of England", "*John Richardson (Archdeacon of Derby) (1905\u20131991), Archdeacon of Derby", "*John Richardson (Archdeacon of Cleveland) (1676\u20131735)", "*John Richardson (dean of Kilmacduagh) (1669\u20131747)", "*John Richardson (judge) (1771\u20131841), English lawyer and judge in the Court of Common Pleas", "*Sir John Richardson (naturalist) (1787\u20131865), Arctic explorer and naturalist ", "*John Richardson (convict) (1797\u20131882), Australian convict who accompanied several exploring expeditions as botanical collector", "*John Richardson, Baron Richardson (1910\u20132004),  British physician", "*John Richardson (Australian Army officer) (1880\u20131954)"]}, {"page": "John Richardson (cricketer, born 1856)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Richardson (Derbyshire cricketer)"]}]}}
