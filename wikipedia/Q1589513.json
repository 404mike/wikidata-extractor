He and two other Liverpool players were banned from football for six months in 1903 for \"accepting illegal financial inducements\" from Southern League club Portsmouth to sign for them. When the ban ended, he signed for Small Heath, where he developed as a strong-tackling defender and formed an excellent full-back pairing with Frank Stokes.Glover played for the Football League representative team and played in England trials, but was not selected for the national team. After retiring from football he kept a public house in Dudley, Worcestershire, and also represented Shropshire at bowls. He died in Dudley at the age of 78.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Glover", "response": ["John Glover may refer to:", "*John Glover (actor) (born 1944), American actor", "*John Glover (artist) (1767\u20131849), English-Australian painter", "*John Glover (MP), cloth merchant and member of the Parliament of England", "*John Glover (New Zealand politician) (1866\u20131947), first secretary of the New Zealand Labour Party", "*John Glover (cricketer, born 1989), Welsh cricketer", "*John Glover (cricketer, born 1992), English cricketer", "*John Glover (footballer) (1876\u20131955), English footballer", "*Charles John Glover, known as Sir John Glover, Lord Mayor of Adelaide 1960\u20131963, see List of mayors and lord mayors of Adelaide ", "*John Glover (preacher) (1714\u20131774), English preacher", "*John Glover (general) (1732\u20131797), American general", "*John Glover (late 18th century), American soldier and pioneer who first settled Greensburg, Kentucky"]}, {"page": "William Goldie", "response": ["He left Anfield in January 1904 (although he played his last match in April 1903, thereafter serving a ban for accepting illegal enhanced payments from prospective employers Portsmouth along with John Glover and Sam Raybould),Liverpool F.C.
