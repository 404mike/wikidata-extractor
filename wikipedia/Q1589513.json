He and two other Liverpool players were banned from football for six months in 1903 for \"accepting illegal financial inducements\" from Southern League club Portsmouth to sign for them. When the ban ended, he signed for Small Heath, where he developed as a strong-tackling defender and formed an excellent full-back pairing with Frank Stokes.Glover played for the Football League representative team and played in England trials, but was not selected for the national team. After retiring from football he kept a public house in Dudley, Worcestershire, and also represented Shropshire at bowls. He died in Dudley at the age of 78.", "link_mentions": {}}}
