In later years he described his approach as that of an \"English Cubist\". In the First World War he served as a gunner on the Western Front, and in 1918 became an official war artist. Roberts's first one-man show was at the Chenil Gallery in London in 1923, and a number of his paintings from the twenties were purchased by the Contemporary Art Society for provincial galleries in the UK. In the 1930s it could be argued that Roberts was artistically at the top of his game; but, although his work was exhibited regularly in London and, increasingly, internationally, he always struggled financially. This situation became worse during the Second World War \u2013 although Roberts did carry out some commissions as a war artist.\nRoberts is probably best remembered for the large, complex and colourful compositions that he exhibited annually at the Royal Academy summer exhibition from the 1950s until his death. He had a major retrospective at the Tate Gallery in 1965, and was elected a full member of the Royal Academy in 1966. There has recently been a revival of interest in the work of this artist who always worked outside the mainstream.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 5", "response": ["*  1895   \u2013 William Roberts, English soldier and painter (d. 1980)"]}, {"page": "January 20", "response": ["*1980 \u2013 William Roberts, English soldier and painter (b. 1895)"]}, {"page": "Isaac Rosenberg", "response": [" During his time at Slade School, Rosenberg notably studied alongside David Bomberg, Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Edward Wadsworth, Dora Carrington, William Roberts, and Christopher Nevinson.

The artists were warned that only 'representative' work would be acceptable, and indeed Bomberg's first version of his Sappers at WorkThe rejected Sappers at Work study is in the Tate Collection. was rejected as being 'too cubist'. Despite these restrictions, the extraordinary canvases feel uncompromisingly modernist, and certainly drew from pre-war avant-garde practices.See David Cleall, 'The First German Gas Attack at Ypres', in William Roberts Society Newsletter, October 2014.", "In the post-war years it was difficult for artists to receive patronage and to secure sales. Nevertheless, Lewis, Wadsworth, Roberts and Atkinson all had one-man shows by the early 1920s \u2013 each artist navigating his own path between modernism and potentially more saleable recognisable subjects.Wadsworth \u2013 Adelphi Gallery, March 1919; Lewis  \u2013 'Guns', Goupil Gallery,  February 1919; Roberts \u2013 Chenil Gallery, November 1923; and Atkinson \u2013 'Abstract Sculpture and Painting', Eldar Gallery, May 1921. Lewis organised one more group show, in 1920 at the Mansard Gallery, bringing together ten artists under the banner 'Group X'.Group X exhibited at the Mansard Gallery in Heal's & Son, Tottenham Court Road, London, from 26 March to 24 April 1920. Now, however, there was little attempt to unify the artists's contributions beyond Lewis's belief that 'the experiments [by artists] undertaken all over Europe during the last ten years should .... not be lightly abandoned.'Wyndham Lewis, 'Introduction', in  Group X exhibition catalogue, 1920. The diversity of styles on display, for example, included four self-portraits by Lewis, while Roberts exhibited four quite radical works in his evolving 'Cubist' style.Athletes Exercising in a Gymnasium, The Wedding, The Auction Room and The Cockneys \u2013 see 'William Roberts: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9' available at http://www.englishcubist.co.uk/catchron.html. Six of the Group X artists had been in the 'Vorticist' group \u2013 Dismorr, Etchells, Hamilton, Lewis, Roberts and Wadsworth \u2013 and they were joined by the sculptor Frank Dobson, the painter Charles Ginner, the American graphic designer Edward McKnight Kauffer, and the painter John Turnbull. The exhibition was mainly seen as a failure to 'rekindle a flame of adventure'.Andrew Gibbon Williams, William Roberts: An English Cubist (Aldershot: Lund Humphries, 2004), pp. 52\u20135.", "Despite a resurgence of abstract art in Britain in the middle years of the twentieth century, the contribution of Vorticism was largely forgotten until a spat between John Rothenstein of the Tate Gallery and William Roberts blew up in the press. Rothenstein's 1956 Tate Gallery exhibition 'Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism' was actually a Lewis retrospective with very few Vorticist works. And the inclusion of work by Bomberg, Roberts, Wadsworth, Nevinson, Dobson, Kramer under the heading 'Other Vorticists' \u2013 together with Lewis's assertion that 'Vorticism, in fact, was what I, personally, did, and said, at a certain period' \u2013  incensed Roberts as it seemed that he and the others were being set up to be mere disciples of Lewis.A letter of 15 November 1964 from Lilian Bomberg to William Lipke in the Tate Gallery archive explains that David Bomberg 'was very angry indeed and I think rightly so that he was included in the Wyndham Lewis Tate Gallery exhibition'.

Lechmere claimed that on one occasion Dismorr stripped naked in Oxford Street to demonstrate she would do anything Lewis asked of her. Dismorr and Wyndham Lewis fell out in 1925 when she refused to purchase some drawings from him when he was short of money but they appeared to have resumed a cordial friendship in 1928 when she did lend him some funds.
