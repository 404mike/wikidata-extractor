She became styled Lady Blomfield after her husband was knighted in 1889.\nBlomfield was born in Ireland and spent much of her adult life in London.  She was married to the noted Victorian era architect Arthur Blomfield, son of Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London. An accomplished writer and humanitarian, Blomfield assisted in founding the Save the Children Fund and was a supporter of the adoption of the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child by the League of Nations.Blomfield joined the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1907 and soon became one of its outstanding proponents and historians.  During the visit of \u02bbAbdu'l-Baha to Paris, she took copious notes of his public meetings which were used in preparing the volume called \"Paris Talks\".  As a tribute to her, \u02bbAbdu'l-Baha bestowed upon her the name \"Sit\u00e1rih Khanum\" (in Persian, \"sit\u00e1rih\" means \"star\", and \"khanum\" means \"lady\").  After the passing of \u02bbAbdu'l-Baha in 1921, Blomfield accompanied Shoghi Effendi on his trip from Britain to Haifa.  While in Haifa, she interviewed members of Baha'u'llah's family. Those recorded recollections, together with her account of the days when she hosted \u02bbAbdu'l-Baha in London, make up the contents of her book, \"The Chosen Highway.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ethel Jenner Rosenberg", "response": ["Rosenberg became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed when she converted in 1899, after having been introduced to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith by Mary Thornburgh-Cropper, an American resident in London who had converted in 1898. Rosenberg was born in the city of Bath, Somerset, to a Jewish family and was a painter trained at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. She was \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's social secretary during his visits to London. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 asked her, among others, to give consideration to publishing Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed books, which resulted in the publication of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in London and A Brief Account of the Bahai Movement.  Rosenberg also assisted Laura Clifford Barney in compiling Some Answered Questions and Lady Blomfield in compiling Paris Talks.", "Rosenberg made three pilgrimages to Haifa, in 1904, 1909 and 1921. When she arrived in Haifa for her third pilgrimage, in 1921, she found that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 had recently died. Remaining in Haifa, she greeted Lady Blomfield, Shoghi Effendi, and Shoghi Effendi's sister Ruhangiz when the three arrived from England on 29 December 1921. Shoghi Effendi gave her instructions for the calling of the first National Spiritual Assembly of England, which she would serve on."]}]}}
