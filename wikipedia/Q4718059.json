However, Professor Alex de Waal, Executive Director of the World Peace Foundation, refutes the Malthus theory, looking instead to political factors as major causes of recent (over the last 150 years) famines. Historically, famines have occurred from agricultural problems such as drought, crop failure, or pestilence. Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, wars, and epidemic diseases such as the Black Death helped to cause hundreds of famines in Europe during the Middle Ages, including 95 in Britain and 75 in France.\"Poor studies will always be with us\", The Telegraph In France, the Hundred Years' War, crop failures and epidemics reduced the population by two-thirds.Don O'Reilly, \"Hundred Years' War: Joan of Arc and the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans \", TheHistoryNet.com", "Noting that modern famines are sometimes aggravated by misguided economic policies, political design to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, or acts of war, political economists have investigated the political conditions under which famine is prevented. Economist Amartya Sen states that the liberal institutions that exist in India, including competitive elections and a free press, have played a major role in preventing famine in that country since independence. Alex de Waal has developed this theory to focus on the \"political contract\" between rulers and people that ensures famine prevention, noting the rarity of such political contracts in Africa, and the danger that international relief agencies will undermine such contracts through removing the locus of accountability for famines from national governments."]}, {"page": "1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia", "response": ["Although a UN estimate of one million deaths is often quoted for the 1983\u20131985 famine, this figure has been challenged by famine scholar Alex de Waal.

As a young politician, he created the Darfur Development Front (DDF) to create a common agenda to advocate for the region's interests.  However, he proved unable to bring all the provincial interests into a common front.Alex de Waal, \"Tragedy in Darfur\" , Boston Review, October/November 2004  Although, the Front was popular from its creation with Fur because of its founder's ethnic connections, it was open to all Darfuris; its name suggesting that \"development\" should be the primary concern of political action.  By the time of the February 1968 election, the politics had become ethnically polarized between rival factions of the Umma Party. Sadiq al-Mahdi, calculating that the province's demographics favored the \"African\" tribes, successfully courted the DDF, leaving Imam al-Hadi to mobilize the \"Arab\" vote.  Sadiq's faction won 13 of 24 seats, while the faction led by al-Hadi received seven.  The factions were reconciled only when the parliamentary government was overthrown by the military coup of Col. Gaafar Nimeiry in May 1969. Both Diraige and al-Sadiq were arrested, while al-Hadi was executed.G\u00e9rard Prunier, Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide, Cornell University Press, 2005, , p. 741-42", "In 1979, Darfuris rioted after their province became the only one in which the governor, al-Tayeb al-Mardi, was not locally chosen.  Nimeiry had chosen al-Tayeb al-Mardi to oversee the support to the Chadian guerilla force led by Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9, but grew concerned that he was losing control of the situation. In January 1980, he dismissed al-Tayeb al-Mardi and appointed Diraige.  The appointment of the DDR leader resulted in an immediate lessening of tensions. Diraige refused to accept a salary and quickly concentrated on replacing posts filled due to political patronage with largely apolitical civil servants from across the ethnic spectrum who had all been affiliated with the DDF since 1964.  The many problems facing the provincial government, including rising racial tensions, the accumulated administrative neglect and spillover from the conflict in Chad, was soon superseded by steadily diminishing rains.Prunier, pp. 49  In the 1981 provincial elections, ethnicity had become a dominant political factor and Diraige, with his large Fur base of support and long out of jail, easily won the governorship. His election, in turn sparked plans by Darfuri Arabs to join with the Zaghawa and Fellata and form an \"Arab Alliance.\"Flint, Julie and Alex de Waal, Darfur: A Short History of a Long War, Zed Books, London March 2006, , p. 51", "By 1987, the situation had worsened.  The Libya-Chad War overflowed into the province, resulting in widespread violence.  Many Fur military conscripts fighting the Second Sudanese Civil War deserted to the side of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Sudanese Brig. Fadlallah Burma Nasir and Chief of Staff Brig. Fawzi Ahmed el-Fadl visited Diraige at his home in London, asking if he would come back and support the government to stop the desertion of Fur soldiers.  Diraige refused.Prunier, p. 62   In the late 1980s, Darfuri politician Daud Bolad sought help from the SPLA in extending the rebellion to Darfur.  Other leftist leaders, such as Diraige, believed that the SPLA would use them for its own purpose and intentionally did not associate themselves with the southern rebels.  Bolad's capture in 1991 and the destruction of his resistance network was seen as confirmation that this was the correct stance.Flint and de Waal, p. 22, and Alex de Waal, \"Counter-Insurgency on the Cheap\", London Review of Books, 5 August 2004", "Diraige created the Sudan Federal Democratic Alliance (SFDA), a member organization of the opposition National Democratic Alliance.

Diraige used his personal credibility to get the Darfuri rebels to agree to talks on humanitarian matters in Geneva to be mediated by the Henri Dunant Foundation, as a trust-building first step.  The government then broke Diraige's trust by publicly demanding a meeting on \"national reconciliation\" in Khartoum.  This had been the last line of communication that the government still had with the Fur rebels.Prunier, p. 112  In 2003, the Darfur Liberation Front, a new rebel group fighting a steadily escalating conflict asked the SFDA for political and logistical support.
