Frank Staton had the honour of scoring the club's first league goal which came in a 5\u20131 loss at Aston Villa.

Stoke's heaviest defeat was a 7\u20130 loss away at the eventual winners of both League and cup Preston North End. Two Stoke players failed to board the train on the morning of that game at Deepdale and so Preston agreed to loan two of their reserves (Bill Smalley and Alfred Dempsey) to make up the numbers.

When Stoke went to Deepdale, the home of Preston North End on 6 October 1888 they were missing two players who failed to board the train the morning so Preston lent them Smalley and fellow reserve team player Alfred Dempsey.
