The resulting damage from this hit slowed King's car, and as a result, he lost the race lead to teammate Josh Webster, but maintained second place until the end of the race. In the second race \u2013 with a partially-reversed grid \u2013 King started third but led by the end of the first lap, and ultimately went on to claim his first win in the series. King swept the races at Brands Hatch and Oulton Park, before his five-race win streak was ended at Knockhill, after he was forced to retire with a coolant leak. In the second race, King started from tenth on the grid but made his way through the order, passing erstwhile race leader Scott McKenna on the final lap to take the victory. King retired from the lead in both races at Thruxton due to punctures, but then won the last six races of the season \u2013 wrapping up the championship title with a round to spare."]}]}}
