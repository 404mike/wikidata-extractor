The 1976 Teddy Boy March is often credited as the spark which ignited the Rockabilly revival and explosion in popularity of younger rockabilly acts such as Stray Cats and The Blasters during the early 1980s. Due to polished production and strategic artist promotion from EMI, the band's major label releases are often associated with the new wave scene, which embraced an entirely new generation of rockabilly-inspired groups. In 1980, The Flying Saucers appeared in the film Blue Suede Shoes, which was a documentary on rock and roll directed by Curtis Clark.
