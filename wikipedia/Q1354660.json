Hunt was \"one of the key figures\nin nineteenth-century English watercolour painting. His work was extensively collected in his lifetime, particularly his genre pictures of children, often in humorous situations, and his detailed, naturalistic still lifes of fruit, flowers, and birds' nests that earned him the nickname \u2018Bird\u2019s Nest\u2019 Hunt.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Watercolor painting", "response": ["The confluence of amateur activity, publishing markets, middle class art collecting, and 19th-century technique led to the formation of English watercolor painting societies: the Society of Painters in Water Colours (1804, now known as the Royal Watercolour Society) and the New Water Colour Society (1832, now known as the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours). (A Scottish Society of Painters in Water Colour was founded in 1878, now known as the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour.) These societies provided annual exhibitions and buyer referrals for many artists. They also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates, particularly between advocates of traditional (\"transparent\") watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with body color or gouache (\"opaque\" watercolor). The late Georgian and Victorian periods produced the zenith of the British watercolor, among the most impressive 19th-century works on paper, due to artists Turner, Varley, Cotman, David Cox, Peter de Wint, William Henry Hunt, John Frederick Lewis, Myles Birket Foster, Frederick Walker, Thomas Collier, Arthur Melville and many others. In particular, the graceful, lapidary, and atmospheric watercolors (\"genre paintings\") by Richard Parkes Bonington created an international fad for watercolor painting, especially in England and France in the 1820s."]}, {"page": "Cecil Gordon Lawson", "response": ["Lawson's first works were studies of fruit, flowers, etc., in the manner of William Henry Hunt; followed by riverside Chelsea subjects. His first exhibit at the Royal Academy (1870) was Cheyne Walk, and in 1871 he sent two other Chelsea subjects. These gained full recognition from fellow-artists, if not from the public. Among his friends were now numbered Fred Walker, GJ Pinwell and their associates. Following them, he made a certain number of drawings for wood-engraving. In 1871 he contributed Summer Showers to a mixed charity exhibition held in support of those affected by the Franco-Prussian War.The painting was contributed by the artist to the 'Exhibition for the Benefit of the Distressed Peasantry of France', London in 1871 (no.101) and priced 7 guineas."]}, {"page": "1864 in art", "response": ["* February 10 \u2013 William Henry Hunt, English watercolor painter (born 1790)"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* William Henry Hunt (1790\u20131864) \u2013 English watercolor painter"]}, {"page": "William Hunt", "response": ["* William Henry Hunt (painter) (1790\u20131864), English water-colour painter", "* William Henry Hunt (judge) (1857\u20131949), United States judge", "* William Henry Hunt (diplomat) (1863\u20131951), United States diplomat", "* William Henry Hunt (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "William Henry Hunt", "response": ["William Henry Hunt may refer to:", "* William Henry Hunt (judge) (1857\u20131949), state and federal judge and a territorial governor of Puerto Rico", "* William Henry Hunt (painter) (1790\u20131864), English watercolour painter", "* William Henry Hunt (diplomat) (1863\u20131951), United States diplomat"]}, {"page": "Cassiobury House", "response": ["The mechanism of the clock which was designed in 1610 by Leonard Tenant was removed from the turret of Cassiobury House and is now on public display in the British Museum as an example of a seventeenth century tower clock.
