They had two children, a daughter and a son. The daughter, Ann, the eldest of the two, married William Henry Watson, a minor politician and judge. The son, William, later to become first Baron Armstrong, was a prominent industrialist, scientist, and inventor. The Armstrong household allowed William to nurture an early mechanical interest, often visiting the joiner employed by William Potter for lessons in mechanics. The family initially lived in a three-storey terraced house on 9 Pleasant Row, Shieldfield, where his son, William was born, and spent his early childhood, developing a passion for water and fishing. The house no longer exists, but the remaining lintel refers to the establishment as the 'Armstrong House', and a stone adjacent to Christ Church, Shieldfield, commemorates it. By the 1820s, with Armstrong's trade flourishing, the family moved to a larger, 12 acre establishment in Ouseburn Valley, where Armstrong built a house, known as South Jesmond House."]}]}}
