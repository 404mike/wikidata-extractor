A largely solid start to the season ensued with 27 points amassed from the first 16 matches. Then, in the FA Cup 4th Qualifying Round, Diamonds were drawn away to their fierce local rivals Kettering Town. Early goals from Lewwis Spence and Rene Howe (penalty) put the away side in firm control. They were reduced to ten men before the hour mark and although Paul Furlong pulled one back for the Poppies just afterwards, Rushden held on to secure a place in the next round and the local bragging rights. In the First Round Proper, however, a controversial 1\u20130 defeat against Yeovil Town ended any further progress in the competition. On 1 December Chairman Keith Cousins stepped down from his role and was replaced by Liam Beasant and Gary Calder. But much worse news was to follow in the coming weeks. On 14 December, hours before the FA Trophy tie away at Eastwood Town, the club received the news that their goalkeeper Dale Roberts had died. This understandably rocked everyone connected with the club, with the coroner recording a verdict of suicide days later.http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/dale-was-so-depressed-1-3258869 Although the beginning of 2011 brought three straight defeats, the club recovered well and found itself in a strong league position come the end of February. However, the 1\u20131 home draw against Hayes & Yeading United at the start of March heralded a downturn in fortunes as the club's form deteriorated rapidly, with just two wins from the last thirteen matches as the club staggered to a 13th-placed finish."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|19||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Lewwis Spence"]}, {"page": "Drew Spence", "response": ["Spence's brother Lewwis Spence is also a professional footballer."]}, {"page": "Lewis Spence (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Lewwis Spence (born 1987), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of English association football families", "response": ["* Lewwis Spence,  Drew Spence (sister)"]}, {"page": "Lewwis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lewwis Spence"]}]}}
