He attended King's Stanley Junior School and St Peters High School in Gloucester and began working in public relations at nineteen years old.

Borkowski has a column in The Guardian and has written two books on publicity stunts as related to public relations and has won several awards for his work.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heather Mills", "response": ["In 2002, Mills accepted damages of \u00a350,000 plus costs from the Sunday Mirror, after a false report that the Charity Commission had investigated her about the money she raised for the Indian Earthquake Victims Appeal in 2001. The extent and nature of the British press coverage of Mills has been criticised, as in May 2003, when The Guardian columnist Matt Seaton wrote a piece declaring: \"There is little that is edifying in the symbolic lynching of Heather. The poisonous judgmentalism that drives it, is in the worst tradition of small town gossip. It is prurient, spiteful, hypocritical, and we should cry 'shame' on it.\" Publicist Mark Borkowski wrote in The Independent on Sunday, on 23 March 2008: \"Not since the cult of Myra Hindley have we encountered so much vitriol aimed at one woman.\" Feminist writer Natasha Walter has compared the coverage to that of Britney Spears. Terence Blacker wrote that public figures who are young, female, pretty and fair-haired, are often subjected to public bullying, which is explained as \"intense media interest\", such as Diana, Princess of Wales, Paula Yates, Ulrika Jonsson and Mills."]}, {"page": "Chalford", "response": ["Notable residents include James Bradley, the third Astronomer Royal, who died in Chalford in 1762, and the 19th-century sculptor John Thomas.

Jeff Jarvis complained that Sidewiki \"takes comments away from my blog and puts them on Google. That sets up Google in channel conflict vs me.

Mark Borkowski predicted that \"SideWiki is going to challenge PR by providing the masses with the tool for the ultimate expression of people power, something uncontainable that will need constant monitoring... SideWiki will make it impossible to promote one message and not be held to account.\" ArsTechnica argued that the comments were of similar value to those on existing sites such as Digg and Reddit, and suggested that without the ability found in Wikipedia to delete and restructure material, it was a \"glorified comment system\"."]}, {"page": "Borkowski", "response": ["* Mark Borkowski (born 1959), British public relations agent and writer"]}, {"page": "Borkowski, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Borkowski"]}, {"page": "Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd", "response": ["Media deemed the trial to be damaging to both Depp and Heard even prior to its beginning.

PR manager Mark Stephens commented that pursuing the case had been \"another example of [Depp's] self-destruction\" and that \"the way this case was run is a matter of enormous consternation because Amber Heard was tried against all of the tropes that he used against women [...] The way in which [Heard] was secondarily abused in the courtroom is an issue which will be studied for years to come.\" Tatiana Siegel of The Hollywood Reporter stated that the trial was simply \"the punctuation\" to Depp's \"self-made implosion\" over the past four years, and that he was now considered a persona non grata in Hollywood."]}]}}
