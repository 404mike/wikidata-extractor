In these performances he appeared alongside Rita Hunter as Br\u00fcnnhilde and Alberto Remedios as Siegfried. The recordings from live performances in English at the London Coliseum are often regarded as constituting a classic audio Ring cycle. Another major Wagner role was Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg, which he sang in many opera houses including the Bayreuth Festival in 1969 and 1970, the ENO and the New York City Opera. He recorded it with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Solti on Decca/London, and in English from the ENO conducted by Goodall on Chandos.

Despite being firmly established, June travelled with the tenor Alberto Remedios to Bulgaria to take part in the Sofia International Competition for young opera singers, winning the gold medal, and giving her wider recognition.

June sang Butterfly under Mario Bernardi towards the conclusion of 1964. She left Sadler Wells Opera in 1963. June's 1965 performance as the countess in the production of The Marriage of Figaro conducted by Charles Mackerras received strong praise from the critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor.
