In the opening game of the season, Morais scored against his former club, Oldham Athletic, which Stevenage lost 4\u20133, as his former club came back to haunt him. Shortly after, Morais scored his second goal a few days later, converting from a penalty, in a 2\u20130 win over Ipswich Town, in the first round of the League Cup. As a result of his performance, Morais was linked a move away from Stevenage, as Championship clubs were keen to sign him and informed Manager Graham Westley he wanted to leave the club. The club tried to sell him on Deadline Day. However, no clubs step forward to make a bid for Morais. It presumed that Morais was dropped for seven games because of this despite being fit and made his return, where he came on as a substitute for Greg Tansey in the 56th minute, in a 1\u20130 loss against Coventry City. On his return, Morais scored from the penalty in a 2\u20131 win over Milton Keynes Dons in the second round of the Football League Trophy. Morais commented after the match, saying the game left him in good spirit. Two weeks later, on 22 October 2013, Morais scored a brace, in a 3\u20130 win over Crewe Alexandra. Then, on 12 November 2013, Morais scored another goal, also from a penalty spot, in a 3\u20132 win over Leyton Orient in the quarter-final of the Football League Trophy. Morais scored from a penalty spot a month later, on 7 December 2013, in a 4\u20130 win over Stourbridge. Morais next goal came from a penalty spot on 14 January 2014, in a 2\u20130 win over Swindon Town. Morais was then sent-off after \"for shoving the ball at Alex Wynter\", in a 3\u20132 loss against Colchester United, which turned out to be his last appearance for the club and didn't play again for the rest of the season, as Stevenage finished twenty-fourth place, therefore relegated to League Two.
