According to this legend, Cook and Banks were exploring the area when they happened upon the animal. They asked a nearby local what the creatures were called. The local responded \"kangaroo\", said to mean \"I don't know/understand\", which Cook then took to be the name of the creature. Anthropologist Walter Roth was trying to correct this legend as far back as in 1898, but few took note until 1972 when linguist John B. Haviland in his research with the Guugu Yimithirr people was able to confirm that gangurru referred to a rare large dark-coloured species of kangaroo. However, when Phillip Parker King visited the Endeavour River region in 1819 and 1820, he maintained that the local word was not kangaroo but menuah perhaps referring to a different species of macropod. There are similar, more credible stories of naming confusion, such as with the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula."]}, {"page": "Goreng Goreng", "response": ["The precise borders of traditional Gooreng Gooreng lands have been disputed. Walter Roth, while collecting data on their language in the later 19th century, placed them in Camboon  Rawbelle where their main camp was at that time, Jiggings\". Norman Tindale distinguished them from a Goeng Meerooni Coastal people (1770/Agnes) and defined their land as extending over  and embracing the eastern bank of the upper Burnett River from Mundubbera north to Callide Ranges Queensland and East to Mt Perry Ranges and  Many Peaks. It is possible that a confusion arose, taking two distinct dialect forms of the one cultural complex, to denote distinct and separate realities, with the Gureng Gureng taken to be an inland tribe, and the Goeng (Meerooni) denoting their affines on the coast. A recent survey of the available evidence concludes that the Goreng goring's lands encompassed the \"whole of Boyne Valley to Auburn NoGo Callide Cania Ranges No Coastal Reef Dialect Language exists as Kooreng Gooreng Gooreng Gooreng are inland Freshwater People"]}, {"page": "Guyanese literature", "response": ["The Indigenous peoples in Guyana did not use written language at the advent of their interaction with the early European explorers, nonetheless, their oral traditions and culture have been documented to varying degrees since that time and continue to have a presence in contemporary Guyanese literature.

However, Holmer also uses \u27e8D\u27e9 to indicate an interdental stop (where others have used \u27e8dh\u27e9), and indeed, he alphabetises Darumbal along with other words beginning with an interdental stop, making his Darumbal equivalent in pronunciation to Dharumbal. From the available material then, Angela Terrill justifiably uses Dharumbal."]}]}}
