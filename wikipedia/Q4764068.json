The following year, he was part of the squad to face the British Lions in their tour of New Zealand and Australia. In an interview with The Scotsman, Angus Black was complimentary of the flanker, recalling: \"Crowley was very good. I spent most of my day getting tackled hard. I was up in the air more often than I was on the ground. Crowley sorted us all out.\" The third test was to be Crowley's career defining performance as an All Black. Due to injuries, New Zealand had to play much of the match with six forwards, and Crowley ended having to do the work of two men instead of one. Crowley scored two tries against the Lions, the first was in the second test, and the second was when he was playing for Auckland."]}, {"page": "Royal Air Force Rugby Union", "response": ["*  Angus Black"]}, {"page": "2018 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award", "response": ["*Angus Black Gareth Williams Haydn Morgan"]}]}}
