Among his many books, two of the best known are his Penguin Dictionary of Music, which was reprinted in several editions between 1958 and 1996, and his biography of Arthur Sullivan, which was praised by critics in Britain and America. As an academic, Jacobs taught at the Royal Academy of Music, at Huddersfield Polytechnic, and at universities in the US, Canada, and Australia.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Sullivan", "response": ["Sullivan's scholarship was extended to a second year, and in 1858, in what his biographer Arthur Jacobs calls an \"extraordinary gesture of confidence\",Jacobs, p. 17 the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in Germany, at the Leipzig Conservatoire. There, Sullivan studied composition with Julius Rietz and Carl Reinecke, counterpoint with Moritz Hauptmann and Ernst Richter, and the piano with Louis Plaidy and Ignaz Moscheles.Ainger, p. 37 He was trained in Mendelssohn's ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of styles, including those of Schubert, Verdi, Bach and Wagner.Jacobs, p. 24 Visiting a synagogue, he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his grand opera, Ivanhoe. He became friendly with the future impresario Carl Rosa and the violinist Joseph Joachim, among others.Jacobs, pp. 22\u201324", "His Irish Symphony of 1866 won similarly enthusiastic praise, but as Arthur Jacobs notes, \"The first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last.\"Jacobs, p. 48 A comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that \"Sullivan's unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation.\"Jacobs, p. 49"]}, {"page": "Richard D'Oyly Carte", "response": ["Carte was born at his parents' house in Greek Street, Soho, in the West End of London on 3 May 1844; he was the eldest of six children. His father, Richard Carte, was a flautist, and his mother was the former Eliza Jones (1814\u20131885); they had eloped, to the disappointment of her father, Thomas Jones, a clergyman.Young, pp. 98\u201399 Carte was of Welsh and probably Norman ancestry; D'Oyly is a Norman French name which the biographer Arthur Jacobs emphasises was in this case \"a forename (not part of a double surname)\".Jacobs, Arthur. \"Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844\u20131901)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008,  To supplement his income as a performer, Carte's father joined the firm of Rudall, Rose & Co., musical instrument makers and music publishers, in 1850.Burgess, Michael. \"Richard D'Oyly Carte\", The Savoyard, January 1975, pp. 7\u201311 After he became a partner in the business, it changed its name to Rudall, Rose, Carte and Co. and later to Rudall, Carte & Co.\"New Music\", The Era, 21 March 1869 The family moved away from Soho when Carte was a boy.

Sullivan's biographer, Arthur Jacobs, wrote: \"[Sullivan] had composed a brilliant new score (his most subtle yet) to a scintillating libretto. ... Iolanthe is the work in which Sullivan's operetta style takes a definite step forward, and metamorphosis of musical themes is its characteristic new feature. ... By recurrence and metamorphosis of themes Sullivan made the score more fluid\".Jacobs 1984, pp. 176\u201379 Sullivan's overture was superior in structure and orchestration to those that his assistants had constructed for the earlier operas.Ainger, p. 216 Much of his \"fairy\" music pays deliberate homage to the incidental music written by Felix Mendelssohn for an 1842 production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Richard Wagner's Ring cycle premiered in London earlier in 1882.Fifield, Christopher. Ibbs and Tillett: The Rise and Fall of a Musical Empire, Chapter 3, pp. 25\u201326, London: Ashgate Publishing, 2005.  The music for the fairies reflects Wagner's style, and the score uses leitmotifs, including a distinctive four-note theme associated with the character of Iolanthe. The Fairy Queen's music parodies that of Wagnerian heroines such as Br\u00fcnnhilde.Williams, p. 217 The score is wider in range of emotion and style, with innovative use of pizzicato strings, clever and varied underscoring of patter, the tender, sentimental eleventh-hour number for the title character, apt matching of the music to the absurd comedy of the lyrics, and a sustained first act finale with a series of dramatic situations that ends with the confrontation between the fairies and peers."]}, {"page": "Henry Wood", "response": ["On leaving the Royal Academy of Music in 1888, Wood taught singing privately and was soon very successful, attracting \"more singing pupils than I could comfortably deal with\"Wood, p. 36 at half a guinea an hour.

These experts now believe the play may have been first brilliantly rehabilitated by Anthony Quayle's 1947 production at the Phoenix Theatre, starring Cyril Ritchard as Lord Foppington and brought to Broadway by Ritchard in 1950.

Following Donald Sinden's outstanding and award-winning performance at the Aldwych Theatre in the mid-1960s Vanbrugh's original play is now again a favourite of the stage. A 2001 revival by Trevor Nunn at the National Theatre was described by Sheridan Morley as \"rare, loving and brilliantly cast.\" As so often with commentary on The Relapse, Morley focused on the role of Lord Foppington and its different interpretations: \"Alex Jennings superbly inherits the role of Lord Foppington which for 20 years or so belonged to Donald Sinden, and for another 20 before that to Cyril Ritchard.\"Sheridan Morley, \"Company Pride\", 28 July 2001, review in The Spectator."]}, {"page": "Eugen d'Albert", "response": ["D'Albert was brought up in Glasgow and taught music by his father until he won a scholarship to the new National Training School for Music (forerunner of the Royal College of Music) in London, which he entered in 1876 at the age of 12. D'Albert studied at the National Training School with Ernst Pauer, Ebenezer Prout, John Stainer and Arthur Sullivan. By the age of 14, he was winning public praise from The Times as \"a bravura player of no mean order\" in a concert in October 1878. He played Schumann's Piano Concerto at the Crystal Palace in 1880, receiving more encouragement from The Times: \"A finer rendering of the work has seldom been heard.\"The Times 17 October 1878, p. 4The Times, 8 February 1881, p. 8 Also in 1880, d'Albert arranged the piano reduction for the vocal score of Sullivan's sacred music drama The Martyr of Antioch, to accompany the chorus in rehearsal.Information about The Martyr of Antioch  He is also credited with writing, under Sullivan's direction, the overture to Gilbert and Sullivan's 1881 opera, Patience.Biographer Michael Ainger wrote that on the evening of 21 April 1881, \"Sullivan gave his sketch of the overture to Eugene d'Albert to score. D'Albert was a seventeen-year-old student ... and winner of the Mendelssohn Scholarship that year\" (Ainger, p. 195). David Russell Hulme studied the handwriting in the manuscript score of Patience and confirmed that it is that of Eugene, not of his father Charles (as had erroneously been reported by biographer Arthur Jacobs), both of whose script Hulme sampled.

In the 1980s, a longer version of the score was prepared, drawing on Sullivan\u2019s manuscript and including two passages deleted by the composer before the original 1889 publication.
