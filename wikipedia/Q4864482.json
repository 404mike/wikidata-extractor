The scheme's purpose was to raise \u00a3150,000 in order to move, drain and relay the playing surface at St. James Park for the first time in 106 years. This was seen as a necessary step in order for the club to reach the Championship. Many fundraising events were planned, such as a horse race night and an evening with former City manager Eamonn Dolan and former players Dean Moxey and George Friend all talking about their times at the club, amongst others. Proceeds from other events, such as a music concert at Rougemont Gardens, former Grecians Barry McConnell and Scott Hiley running the Great West Run to raise money and 50% of the profits of Nick Spencer's Never say die: the remarkable rise of Exeter City book; also contributed to the scheme. By 24 June, the scheme had raised over \u00a340,000, even before the evening with Dolan, Moxey and Friend and the Great West Run.For the unveiling of the scheme, its purpose and target  AND ", "* For Barry McConnell and Scott Hiley running the Great West Run "]}]}}
