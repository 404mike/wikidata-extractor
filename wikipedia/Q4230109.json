Carl Meissner, who contributed a section on the Proteaceae in 1856 to the series Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis by Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, recognised twenty-three species, including seven new ones: L. gueinzii, L. mundii, L. reflexum, L. oleaefolium var. brownii (now L.  bolusii), L. zeyheri var. truncatum (now L. truncatum), L. attenuatum var. praemorsum and var. ambiguum (now L. praemorsum and L. erubescens). Otto Kuntze revised the genus in 1891 and called it Leucadendron, a homonym of a name that had already been used by Linnaeus in 1753 for another group of Proteaceae, which have separate sexes and very large bracts. Edwin Percy Phillips newly described L. glabrum and L. muirii in 1910, Spencer Le Marchant Moore portrayed L. saxosum in 1911, while Otto Stapf added L. gerrardii in 1912. In 1912, Phillips and Otto Stapf revised Leucospermum and recognised thirty-one species. Afterwards, Phillips described L. cordatum (1923) and L. patersonii (1928). Robert Harold Compton added L. wittebergense in 1931 and L. catherinae in 1933. This was followed by L. arenarium by Hedley Brian Rycroft in 1959. John Patrick Rourke in 1970 distinguished forty-seven species, eight of which new to science: L. erubescens, L. fulgens, L. innovans, L. pluridens, L. praecox, L. profugum, L. secundifolium and L. utriculosum. He later added the newly discovered L. winteri in 1978, L. hamatum in 1983, and L. harpagonatum in 1994. Rourke erected several sections in 1970, among which Xericola, to which he assigned L. alpinum including a subspecies amoenum, L. obtusum including a subspecies albomontanum, as well as L. secundiflorum. In 1984, he erected a new genus Vexatorella to which he moved these taxa, with the exception of L. secundiflorum, that he included in the section Diastelloidea."]}, {"page": "Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden", "response": ["The Compton Herbarium was founded after the Bolus Herbarium moved from Kirstenbosch to the campus of the University of Cape Town.

In 1924, Robert Harold Compton described Aster schlechteri. When Grau in 1973 wanted to assign the taxon to Felicia, the oldest epithet, elongatus, was not available because Aster elongatus described by Carl Thunberg in 1800, is the basionym of Felicia elongata.

French botanist of Scottish descent, Michel Adanson described the genus Cantarena in 1763. In September 1767, Peter Jonas Bergius described C. scabridum based on Linnaeus' description in the Species Plantarum. In October 1767, Linnaeus distinguished two species, C. glabrum and C. scabrum, abandoning the name C. africanum. Thomas Archibald Sprague in 1940 concluded that C. africanum belongs to the same species and is an older name than C. scabridum. Nicolaas Laurens Burman in 1768 mentioned two species, C. gramineum (now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. gramineum) and C. africanum. Carl Linnaeus the Younger distinguished two additional species, C. villosum and C. filiforme (now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. gramineum) in 1781. Two more species, C. hirtum (a synonym of C. villosum) and C. nervosum (a synonym of C. glabrum), have been described by Carl Thunberg in 1794, who also recognised C. glabrum separately. In 1836, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle described for the first time C. congestum, C. cymosum and C. luteum (now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. gramineum). Danish botanist Christian Friedrich Ecklon mentions but does not describe the name C. hirsutum in 1836 (now C. villosum) in De Candolle's publication. The Irish botanist William Henry Harvey distinguished in 1865 seven species and three varieties, among which the newly introduced names C. latifolium (C. glabrum subsp. glabrum), C. nervosum var. subulifolium, C. scabrum var. filiforme and var. luteum (both now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. gramineum). John Hutchinson added C. fourcadei (now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. fourcadei) in 1932, and Robert Harold Compton described C. laxum in 1936. Mark\u00f6tter in 1939, recognized 12 species and two varieties, three of which were new and are upheld today: C. enerve, C. theileri and C. rogersii (now C. glabrum var. rodgersii). Frans M. Weitz, in his 1989 Revision of the genus Corymbium (Asteraceae), recognizes nine species, two subspecies and six varieties, including the new taxa C. elsiae and C. laxum subsp. bolusii."]}, {"page": "Our South African Birds", "response": ["A companion volume titled Our South African Flora was published at the same time and was edited by Robert Harold Compton, director of the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden in Cape Town.

Because Salisbury did not indicate the type specimen, this cannot be confirmed and the description is not specific enough to rule out that L. bellidifolium is one of several other decumbent species, it cannot be used. Jean Louis Marie Poiret lumped Leucospermum with Protea in 1816, creating the new combination P. spathulata. Otto Kuntze reassigned it to the genus Leucadendron in 1891.
