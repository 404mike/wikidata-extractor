It focuses on modern and contemporary art. Each year the Serpentine Gallery builds a temporary structure for the summer in its grounds, and projects are led by director Julia Peyton-Jones. The Ito-Balmond Serpentine Pavilion has been hailed as one of the most successful temporary pavilions to date. Jonathan Glancey, architecture critic for the UK's The Guardian, called it \"one of the most exquisite and revolutionary buildings of recent times.\" The design is based on an algorithm designed by Balmond. \"Although fun to look at, this structure was rooted in complex geometry\u2026the pavilion had no fa\u00e7ade and no hidden structural frame behind it\u2026 what you saw was 100% pure structure, its holistic beauty like that of a crystal or a snowflake.\" Balmond was awarded the Gengo Matsui Prize for the pavilion, one of the highest awards for engineering given in Japan. The pavilion now serves as the beach club restaurant of a luxury hotel in Le Beauvallon, across the bay from Saint-Tropez in southern France.
