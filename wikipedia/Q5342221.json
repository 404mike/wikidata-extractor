From 1905 Carson was both the Irish Unionist Alliance MP for the University of Dublin and leader of the Ulster Unionist Council in Belfast. In 1915 he entered the war cabinet of H. H. Asquith as Attorney-General. Carson was defeated in his ambition to maintain Ireland as a whole in union with Great Britain. His leadership, however, was celebrated by some for securing a continued place in the United Kingdom for the six north-eastern counties, albeit under a devolved Parliament of Northern Ireland that neither he nor his fellow unionists had sought. He is also remembered for his open ended cross examination of Oscar Wilde in a legal action that Wilde had brought, but which led to him being gaoled and ruined. Carson unsuccessfully attempted to intercede for Wilde after the case.John Brown, \"Carson, Sir Edward, Baron Carson 1854\u20131935\" in David Loades, ed., Reader's Guide to British History (2003) 1:227", "Edward Carson, the second son of Edward Henry Carson, architect, was born at 4 Harcourt Street, in Dublin, into a wealthy Anglican family.Marjoribanks, Volume One: The Life of Lord Carson, London, 1932, p. 5 The Carsons were of Scottish origin, Edward's grandfather having originally moved to Dublin from Dumfries in 1815. Carson's mother was Isabella Lambert, the daughter of Captain Peter Lambert, part of an old Anglo-Irish family, the Lamberts of Castle Ellen, County Galway. Carson spent holidays at Castle Ellen, which was owned by his uncle.Marjoribanks, Volume One: The Life of Lord Carson, London, 1932, p. 6 He was one of six children (four boys and two girls). Edward was educated at Portarlington School, Wesley College, DublinDickson, Brice Drewry, Gavin The Judicial House of Lords 1876\u20132009 Oxford University Press page 755 and Trinity College, Dublin, where he read law and was an active member of the College Historical Society. He also played an early form of hurling with the college team. Carson graduated BA and MA.", "In January 1921 he met in London over three days with Father O'Flanagan and Lord Justice Sir James O'Connor to try to find a mutual agreement that would end the Anglo-Irish war, but without result.\"Memorandum by James O'Connor of an interview with Edward Carson\"; RIA, Dublin, 1993. National Archives of Ireland file UCDA P150/1902", "* The Hon. Edward Carson MP, born 17 February 1920", "Even before his death, there was an organized effort to portray Carson as the heroic embodiment of the militant unionist spirit. In November 1932 the new Stormont Parliament became the greatest Carson monument, giving his admirers the symbolic endorsement of their state. His statue was unveiled as the speakers excited the audience with triumphalist images of Protestant deliverance from Catholic tyranny.  Carson's funeral in 1935 was attended with pomp and unionist symbolism, as happened again with the dedication of a plaque in his memory in 1938. Calling for unity with Britain, numerous ceremonial rituals, memorials, and anniversaries affirmed the legitimacy of the state, and the Protestant ascendancy. The media enthusiastically participated, paying much less attention to such mundane issues as massive unemployment, poor housing, and rising religious tensions.Gillian McIntosh,  \"Symbolic mirrors: commemorations of Edward Carson in the 1930s.\" Irish Historical Studies 32.125 (2000): 93\u2013112.", "File:Northern Ireland Parliament Buildings - Edward Carson statue.jpg|Edward Carson's statue at Stormont", "File:Carson Mural.jpg|Sir Edward Carson mural in Belfast in 2006", "* A.T.Q.
