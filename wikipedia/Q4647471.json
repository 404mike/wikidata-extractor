He presented the 2009 series Henry: Mind of a Tyrant, which Brian Viner, a reviewer for the Independent, called \"highly fascinating\", although A. A. Gill was less complimentary, calling it \"Hello! history\". In an interview about the series for the Radio Times, Starkey complained that too many historians had focused not on Henry, but on his wives. Referring to a \"feminised history\", he said: \"so many of the writers who write about this are women and so much of their audience is a female audience.\" This prompted the historian Lucy Worsley to describe his comments as misogynistic. More recently, in 2011, he taught five history lessons in Channel 4's Jamie's Dream School, after which he criticised the state education system."]}, {"page": "Grimsby", "response": ["Grimsby lies  from the nearest motorway, the M180, which continues as A180 into the town and acts as a link with the national motorway network.

A. Gill wrote in The Sunday Times in 2013.  According to Mark Duguid, again for Screenonline, it suffers \"from its narrow stereotypes of its handful of Indian supporting characters as alternately servile, foolish, lazy or devious\".

His mentor, Marco Pierre White, noted that he is highly competitive. Since the airing of Boiling Point, which followed Ramsay's quest of earning three Michelin stars, the chef has also become infamous for his fiery temper and use of expletives. Ramsay once famously ejected food critic A. A. Gill, whose dining companion was Joan Collins, from his restaurant, leading Gill to state that \"Ramsay is a wonderful chef, just a really second-rate human being.\" Ramsay admitted in his autobiography that he did not mind if Gill insulted his food, but a personal insult he was not going to stand for. Ramsay has also had confrontations with his kitchen staff, including one incident that resulted in the pastry chef calling the police. A 2005 interview reported Ramsay had retained 85% of his staff since 1993. Ramsay attributes his management style to the influence of previous mentors, notably chefs Marco Pierre White and Guy Savoy, father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and Jock Wallace, his manager while a footballer at Rangers."]}, {"page": "Answers in Genesis", "response": ["A.
