He was capped once by the England national B team, having previously played twelve times and scored once for the under-21s.\nWatson moved into coaching after retiring from playing and was appointed as an academy coach at Huddersfield Town under former teammate Lee Clark in 2010.

Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities. The training ground was in the process of being sold, despite this, Keegan paid for the clean up of the training ground with his own money, with the cleaning work being done in one weekend. Keegan felt this clean up work was an important move and an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high. Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at. In five-a-sides he and Terry McDermott, both in their 40s, with their lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the stand out players. Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: Lee Clark, Steve Watson, Steve Howey, Alan Thompson and Robbie Elliott. These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997. Keegan noted Steve Watson would take throw-ins via a somersault throw and this amused and shocked Keegan. Keegan regarded it as a gimmick and he could not believe the fans would take joy in it. The throw-in, to Keegan, was a sign of how far Newcastle had fallen. Keegan wanted the club to be known for scoring goals and thrilling football. Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped the midfielder Lee Clark. Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off. Prior to the game Keegan arranged a training match for the reserves and included himself to make up the numbers. In the training match a frustrated Clark went through the back of Keegan in a knee high tackle, following a hospital pass, in a similar way that Romeo Benetti went into the back of Keegan in an England versus Italy match. The melee resulted in Pavel Srnicek swinging a roundhouse kick at Lee Clark's head. Keegan was not upset and he did not punish either player. To Keegan, Srnicek and Clark's response showed they cared about their football. Keegan's first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3\u20130 victory in front of a capacity crowd."]}, {"page": "Gateshead F.C.", "response": ["|2017\u20132019||Steve Watson"]}, {"page": "Lee Clark (footballer)", "response": ["On 26 June 2012, Clark was confirmed as manager of Birmingham City, with Terry McDermott as his Assistant Manager and Derek Fazackerley and Steve Watson as his First Team Coaches.

After a full pre-season with Villa, Gregory promoted Delaney to first choice right-back ahead of Steve Watson at the start of the following season. Delaney credits Gregory with improving his performances during his early career with Villa, Gregory singling out Delaney during his seventh appearance for the side, describing him as \"playing like a tart\" during the half-time team talk.

Once promoted, Howey continued to be a first-choice centre back but was often missing through injury. During Howey's time at Newcastle they were Premier League runner-up twice in 1995/96 and 1996/97 in addition to FA Cup runner-up in 1997/98 and 1998/99.

The intensifying boardroom battle soon took its toll on the club, and Smith resigned early in the following season with the side stuck in mid-table. Ossie Ardiles became the club's new manager, and despite being initially being the club's most popular manager since Joe Harvey, Newcastle dropped to the bottom of the Second Division in October 1991. Results failed to improve, despite the acquisition of a new striker in David Kelly and the efforts of promising young players including Steve Howey, Steve Watson and Gavin Peacock, and in February 1992 Ardiles was sacked. Despite being the best-supported side in the division and frequently still managing to pull in crowds of more than 20,000, Newcastle were also millions of pounds in debt and faced with the real prospect of third tier football for the first time ever.
