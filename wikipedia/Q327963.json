He appeared in many feature films and television programmes, often in aristocratic or supercilious roles. Prematurely balding and greying, Vernon settled into playing archetypal middle-aged lords and military types while still in his 30s. He is perhaps best known for originating the role of Slartibartfast in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Other notable roles included Edwin Oldenshaw in The Man in Room 17 (1965-67), Sir James Greenley, alias \"C\" in The Sandbaggers (1978-80) and Sir Desmond Glazebrook in Yes Minister (1980-81) and its sequel series Yes, Prime Minister (1987).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Slartibartfast", "response": ["Slartibartfast was first portrayed in the 1978 radio serial, in which he was voiced by Richard Vernon, who also portrayed him in the 1981 live-action miniseries.
