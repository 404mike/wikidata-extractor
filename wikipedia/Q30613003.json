In Stafford, Smith became involved with the trade union movement, and in time became leader of the Staffordshire Riveters.In 1873, Smith organised a conference which successfully persuaded various local bootmakers' unions to merge.  They formed the National Union of Boot and Shoe Rivetters and Finishers, and Smith easily elected as its first general secretary.  He moved to Leicester to set up headquarters there, and became active in the local Liberal Party.  Running the union proved difficult, with opposition from some employers, various factions vying for influence, and finances precarious, but it survived.  In 1877, when the Trades Union Congress was held in Leicester, Smith was elected to its Parliamentary Committee.Smith was elected to Leicester School Board in 1877, and the year after, resigned as secretary of the union to become the full-time secretary of the Leicester Liberal Association, although he retained his union membership.  He remained secretary of the Liberals until 1892, by which time he had also been elected to Leicester Town Council.  He then took employment with the Board of Trade as an official arbitrator in trade disputes.  Remaining on the council, he served as Mayor of Leicester in 1907/08.Smith died in 1919, while serving as an alderman on the council.  His obituary in The Observer noted that he was a friend of Henry Broadhurst.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicester", "response": ["* Alderman Thomas Smith : 3 July 1918."]}, {"page": "Stone, Staffordshire", "response": ["* Thomas Smith (1847 in Stone \u2013 1919) trade union leaderNed Newitt website retrieved 29 September 2017 and Liberal politician, general secretary of National Union of Boot and Shoe Rivetters and Finishers"]}, {"page": "Thomas Smith", "response": ["Thomas Smith may refer to:", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Midhurst), MP for Midhurst", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Great Bedwyn) (1382\u20131399), English politician", "*Thomas Smith (MP for New Romney) (1419\u20131432), MP for New Romney", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Dover), 1470\u20131471 ", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Bristol), 1512, MP for Bristol", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Chippenham), 1554", "*Sir Thomas Smith (diplomat) (1513\u20131577), English scholar and diplomat", "*Thomas Smith (MP for multiple constituencies) (1522\u20131591), Member of Parliament for Tavistock, Aylesbury, Rye, Winchelsea and Portsmouth", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Wigan), MP for Wigan, 1558", "*Thomas Smith (English judge) (c. 1556\u20131609), member of Parliament for Cricklade, and for Tamworth", "*Thomas Smith (MP for Sudbury), MP for Sudbury, 1626", "*Thomas Smith (governor of South Carolina) (1648\u20131694), governor of South Carolina, planter, merchant and surgeon", "*Thomas Smith (died 1728) (c. 1686\u20131728), British Whig politician, MP for four constituencies 1709\u20131728", "*Thomas Smith (Royal Navy officer) (1707\u20131762), governor of Newfoundland and Labrador", "*Thomas Smith (Pennsylvania congressman) (bef. 1782\u20131846), Federalist member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania", "*Thomas Smith (Indiana congressman) (1799\u20131876), member of the United States House of Representatives from Indiana", "*Thomas Smith (Oregon politician), member of the Oregon Territorial Legislature, 1855\u20131856", "*Thomas Smith (Upper Canada politician) (1754\u20131833), land surveyor, merchant and politician in Upper Canada", "*Thomas Smith (Australian politician) (1846\u20131925), Victorian politician", "*Sir Thomas Smith (Chester MP), English politician who sat in the House of Commons, 1640\u20131644", "*Sir Thomas Smith, 1st Baronet, of Hatherton (1622\u20131675), English politician", "*Thomas Smith (Cavalier) (1609\u20131642), English Member of Parliament", "*Thomas Smith (East India Company) (1558\u20131625), English merchant, politician and first governor of the East India Company", "*Thomas Smith (Lord Mayor of London) (1746\u20131823), merchant and Lord Mayor of London", "*Thomas Smith (Pennsylvania judge) (1745\u20131809), politician and judge from Pennsylvania", "*Thomas Smith (English judge) (1556?\u20131609), Master of Requests", "*Thomas Smith (English soldier) (fl. 1600\u20131627), English soldier", "*Thomas Smith (Medal of Honor, 1865) (1838\u20131905), American Civil War sailor", "*Thomas Smith (Medal of Honor, 1869), American Indian Wars soldier", "*Thomas Smith (Medal of Honor, 1878) (1856\u2013?), American sailor", "*Thomas Smith (Registrary) (fl. late 16th century), fourth recorded Registrary of the University of Cambridge", "*Thomas Smith (banker) (1631\u20131699), founder of the first bank in England outside London", "*Thomas Smith (engineer) (1752\u20131814), Scottish businessman and lighthouse engineer", "*Thomas Smith (scientist), geophysicist", "*Thomas Smith (headmaster) (1814\u20131879), Governor of Elmfield College (1868-?)", "*Sir Thomas Smith (barrister) (1915\u20131988), lawyer, soldier and academic", "*Thomas Smith (finance professor) (born 1958), Australian finance professor", "*Thomas Smith & Sons, crane manufacturers of Rodley, West Yorkshire, UK", "*Sir Thomas Smith, 1st Baronet, of Stratford Place (1833\u20131909), British surgeon", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1848) (1848\u2013?), English cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1854) (1854\u2013?), English cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1898) (1898\u20131926), Australian cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1899) (1899\u20131965), English cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (cricketer, born 1905) (1905\u20131993), English cricketer", "*Thomas Smith (Australian footballer) (1851\u20131909), Australian footballer", "*Thomas Smith (cornerback) (born 1970), American professional football player", "*Thomas Smith (English footballer) (1869\u2013?), English footballer", "*Thomas Smith (Scottish footballer) (born 1908), Scottish footballer", "*Thomas Smith (sport shooter) (born 1931), American Olympic shooter", "*R.
