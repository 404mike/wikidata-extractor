Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be \"emotionally and cognitively easy\". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton \"was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child\u00a0... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent\u00a0... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas\u00a0... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact should come as no surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her.\" Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in \"representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership\". Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she \"loved a relationship with children through her books\", but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing."]}, {"page": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "response": ["Nicholas Tucker described the early Harry Potter books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes. However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying."]}, {"page": "Watership Down", "response": ["The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying \"If there is no place for Watership Down in children's bookshops, then children's literature is dead.\" Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: \"Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created.\" Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that \"subtly speaks to a child\", with \"engaging characters and fast-paced action [that] make it readable.\" This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: \"Adams... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one.\"", "The 1993 Puffin Modern Classics edition of the novel contains an afterword by Nicholas Tucker, who wrote that stories such as Watership Down \"now fit rather uneasily into the modern world of consideration of both sexes\".

The book is suggested by many educational specialists as recommended reading for children to acquaint them with death, as reading material and as classroom prompts for activities."]}, {"page": "Fifty Years of Freedom", "response": ["Multiple reviewers highlighted Hemmings's association with the school. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) wrote that although Neill did not want disciples, Hemmings \"accepts generally the 'Summerhill idea and would fit the role. Nicholas Tucker (New Statesman) too noted the book as \"very one-sided, verging on the uncritical\" despite its readability and signs of thorough research. He said that a balanced account of Summerhill was elusive because of the \"sensationalized\" press and \"rosy\" recollections of Neill and his former pupils, similar to the memoirs of \"Old Boys' clubs elsewhere\". He wrote, however, that Hemmings's position was understandable when considering the criticism that Summerhill and Neill withstood from \"conventional educational wisdom\" and \"horrified hearsay\", which had turned the school into \"a type of scholastic folk myth\" to set straight. Still, Tucker saw less cause for Summerhill's defense by the time of publication as Neill had wider acceptance. He had become a powerful figure in education and his school a template for the American free school movement. Cowie wrote that Neill seemed to be enjoying greater acceptance in his later life as Summerhill was \"losing its uniqueness as 'that dreadful school. Nordberg (Best Sellers) said that while Hemmings has some criticism for Neill and \"open education\", \"he is basically an enthusiast\" who wrote a \"sympathetic portrayal\". Even from this sympathetic angle, Nordberg felt that Neill came across as \"the child of an overly strict and demanding father who has spent the rest of his life in a rather one-dimensional crusade, more visceral than rational, against authority in all forms.\" Altogether, Nordberg wrote, Fifty Years succeeds in its \"systematic, scholarly look at the Summerhill idea\" but fails to provide \"a balanced, profound look\" at its counterpart: \"need for restraint, rationality, and responsibility in the world\"."]}, {"page": "Tucker, Nicholas", "response": ["#redirectNicholas Tucker"]}, {"page": "Mondays Are Red", "response": ["Critical reception has been positive.
