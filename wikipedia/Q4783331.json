Her parents, Thomas Goddard, an heir to a Salisbury cutlery firm, and Arabella n\u00e9e Ingles, were part of an English community of expatriates living in Saint-Servan near Saint-Malo, Brittany. She remained very proud of her French background all her life, and spiced her conversation with French phrases .At age six she was sent to Paris to study with Friedrich Kalkbrenner.  She was feted as a child prodigy and played for the French royal family and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and George Sand (she would later also play for Queen Victoria).  Her family suffered financial distress during the 1848 Revolution and had to return to England; there, Arabella had further lessons with Lucy Anderson and Sigismond Thalberg.  She first appeared in public in 1850, under the conductor Michael William Balfe, at a Grand National Concert at Her Majesty's Theatre.\nThalberg sent her to be tutored by James William Davison, the chief music critic for The Times.  She made her formal debut on 14 April 1853, playing Beethoven's \"Hammerklavier\" Sonata, the first time the work had been performed in England.  She spent 1854 and 1855 in Germany and Italy.  She played at a concert at the Leipzig Gewandhaus and was very favourably received by the German critics.She was one of the first pianists to play recitals from memory, although her concerto appearances were with the score in front.Goddard returned to England and gave concerts with the Philharmonic Society at the Crystal Palace and at the Monday Popular Concerts.  In 1857 and 1858 she played all the late Beethoven sonatas in London, most of which were still complete novelties to her audiences, and many other works.\nIn 1859 she married her mentor J. W. Davison.  She was 23, he 46. In 1871 she was in the first group of recipients of the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society.\nFrom 1873 to 1876 she conducted a major tour, organised by Robert Sparrow Smythe, of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Java.  In America, the critics were less impressed by her playing of romantic music, but liked her classical playing.  This may have been due to Davison's influence on her: he did not approve of any composers after Mendelssohn. In June 1874, while returning to Townsville, Queensland, from Java, her ship was wrecked, and she had to spend a night in an open boat in torrential rain with Charles Blondin, who was also arriving for an Australian tour.  In October 1875, she appeared in New York City with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Tietjens.\nIn England, George Bernard Shaw was struck by her ability to play the most complex pieces.  He described Teresa Carre\u00f1o as \"a second Arabella Goddard\".  She retired from performing in 1880.\nShe was appointed a teacher at the Royal College of Music in 1883, its first year of operation.A number of composers dedicated pieces to her, including William Sterndale Bennett's Piano Sonata in A-flat, Op. 46 \"The Maid of Orleans\".  She herself composed a small number of piano pieces, including a suite of six waltzes.After the birth of her two sons Henry and Charles, she separated from her husband, who died in 1885.  She died at Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, on 6 April 1922, aged 86.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal College of Music", "response": ["Grove, a close friend of Sullivan, loyally maintained that the new college was a natural evolution from the NTSM. In reality, his aims were radically different from Sullivan's. In his determination that the new institution should succeed as a training ground for orchestral players, Grove had two principal allies: the violinist Henry Holmes and the composer and conductor Charles Villiers Stanford. They believed that a capable college orchestra would not only benefit instrumental students, but would give students of composition the essential chance to experience the sound of their music. The college's first intake of scholarship students included 28 who studied an orchestral instrument. The potential strength of the college orchestra, including fee-paying instrumental students, was 33 violins, five violas, six cellos, one double bass, one flute, one oboe and two horns. Grove appointed 12 professors of orchestral instruments, in addition to distinguished teachers in other musical disciplines including Jenny Lind (singing), Hubert Parry (composition), Ernst Pauer (piano), Arabella Goddard (piano) and Walter Parratt (organ)."]}, {"page": "William Sterndale Bennett", "response": ["In June 1853 Bennett made his last public appearance as a soloist with orchestra in his own Fourth Piano Concerto.French, Elizabeth (2007), \"Bennett & Bache: Piano Concertos\" (liner notes to Hyperion Records CD CDA67595), accessed 12 January 2016.

In the same year Bennett declined an invitation to become the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He was greatly tempted by the offer, but felt it his duty to remain in England, as the offer came too late for Bennett to make alternative arrangements for some of his pupils, and he refused to let them down. After the controversial 1855 season of the Philharmonic Society at which Richard Wagner conducted, Bennett was elected to take over the conductorship in 1856, a post which he held for ten years.Edwards (1903b), p. 381.Stanford (1916), p. 647.

Santley's concert singing reached a high point of acclaim during his subsequent United States and Canadian tour of 1871-72.

However, Borwick's warmth and colour were appreciated by the Philharmonic, who asked him back repeatedly, and Herman Klein felt that at last the dry days of Arabella Goddard and her feux d'artifice were at an end.
