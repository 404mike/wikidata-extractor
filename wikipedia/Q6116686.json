Thompson was close to Johnny Adair during Adair's time as leader of the UDA West Belfast Brigade and remained one of the last of the \"C Company\" members to support Adair. Thompson was briefly brigadier in West Belfast in 2003 between Adair's imprisonment and his fall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Johnny Adair", "response": ["As he grew older Adair took to the streets, forming a skinhead street gang with a group of young loyalist friends, who \"got involved initially in petty then increasingly violent crime\". Members included Donald Hodgen, Sam \"Skelly\" McCrory, \"Fat\" Jackie Thompson, James and Herbie Millar.Wood, pp. 155\u201356 Adair, Hodgen, McCrory and Thompson were classmates at the Somerdale School on the Crumlin Road. Although the gang still officially attended school, they would frequently play truant, take a bus into the countryside and consume large quantities of cider.Lister & Jordan, p. 28", "By the early 1990s, a new leadership had emerged on the Shankill Road following the killing of powerful South Belfast Brigadier and UDA Deputy Commander John McMichael in 1987 by a booby-trap car bomb planted by the Provisional IRA; less than three months later, Supreme Commander Andy Tyrie resigned after an attempt was made on his life. He was not replaced; instead the organisation was run by its Inner Council. With the West Belfast UDA brigadier and spokesman Tommy Lyttle in prison and gradually eased out of the leadership, Adair, as the most ambitious of the \"Young Turks\", established himself as head of the UDA's \"C Company\", 2nd Battalion based on the Shankill.McDonald & Cusack, p.161 Adair formed a so-called \"Dream Team\" of active gunmen, with many of his friends from his former skinhead gang including Sam \"Skelly\" McCrory, Mo Courtney, \"Fat\" Jackie Thompson, and Donald Hodgen recruited into the unit.Lister & Jordan, p. 88", "On 20 September 2002, Adair was summoned to an Inner Council meeting held in Sandy Row where there was a showdown between him and the other brigadiers, including Gray. Fearing an ambush, Adair had his allies \"Fat\" Jackie Thompson and James \"Sham\" Millar smuggle a pistol for him to the meeting. Five days later, Adair was expelled from the UDA for treason along with close associate John White. Adair's response to the expulsion was \"Fuck them uns\" and declared the West Belfast Brigade a separate organisation from the mainstream UDA.Lister & Jordan, p. 321 He even erected \"West Belfast UDA \u2013 Business as Usual\" banners on the Shankill Road.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 374\u201375 By this point Adair had even lost the support of the Shoukri brothers, his proteges in north Belfast who had been amongst his closest allies outside of his own area but who decided to side with the mainstream UDA in this dispute. There were attempts on Adair's and White's lives.", "Adair returned to prison in January 2003, when his early release licence was revoked by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Paul Murphy on grounds of engaging in unlawful activity. He appointed \"Fat\" Jackie Thompson as his replacement as Brigadier.Lister & Jordan, p. 327 On 1 February 2003, UDA divisional leader John Gregg was shot dead along with another UDA member, Robert \"Rab\" Carson, on returning from a Rangers FC match in Glasgow. The killing was widely blamed on Adair's C Company \u2013 Gregg was one of those who had organised the expulsion of Adair from the UDA. Among the mainstream UDA, a powerful faction of Adair opponents quickly formed under the leadership of South Belfast brigadier Jackie McDonald. In the early hours of 6 February (five days after Gregg's shooting and just hours before his funeral was due to take place), about twenty Adair supporters, including White and Adair's wife, fled their homes for Scotland after 100 heavily armed men from the mainstream UDA invaded Adair's stronghold, forcing them to quit Northern Ireland.McDonald & Cusack, p. 386"]}, {"page": "John White (loyalist)", "response": ["White and the others were escorted to Larne by the police and immediately caught the ferry to Cairnryan.
