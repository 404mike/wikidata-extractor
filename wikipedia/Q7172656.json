He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1983 to 1998.\nBaldwin was born in Aldershot, England. His family moved to Australia in 1958. He attended Normanhurst Boys' High School in Sydney, and later received a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from the University of Sydney and a Bachelor of Arts from Macquarie University.Baldwin was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1975 to 1982. In the 1970s he was prominent as a left-wing activist in the Australian Labor Party (ALP), in which position he sought to break the grip over the corrupt right-wing machine that controlled many Labor subdivisions in and near central Sydney. In the course of his campaign he uncovered substantial and illegal doctoring of the party's account books in the Enmore branch of the ALP.\nOn 16 July 1980, he was brutally assaulted at his home in the nearby Sydney suburb of Marrickville. Pictures of his battered face dominated the front pages of newspapers around the nation, and led to increased pressure for reform of the party. No one was ever charged with the assault. Subsequently, it was alleged that the bashing was undertaken by underworld figure Tom Domican acting on suggestions from the Labor state secretary at the time, Graham Richardson. In March 2007 Richardson won a settlement against Fairfax of A$50,000 for defamation on the basis of this report.After leaving state politics, Baldwin was selected for the federal Division of Sydney following the deselection of the previous right-aligned MP, Les McMahon. He ran on a platform similar to that advocated by Tony Benn in the British Labour Party, arguing for a revival of Labor's commitment to state ownership and for the implementation of industrial democracy. He held the seat from 1983 to 1998.  He served as Minister for Employment and Education Services in April 1990, Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services from May 1990 to March 1993, and Minister for Social Security from March 1993 to the defeat of the Keating government in March 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Local exchange trading system", "response": ["In a number of countries, LETS have been encouraged as a social security initiative.

In New South Wales, the Steering Committee (which later became known as the Socialist Left in 1989) made advances in branches across the state in the late 1970s and early 1980s under the leadership of Peter Baldwin, initially in the suburbs of Sydney before spreading to the inner cities. This culminated in the deselection of the right-aligned MP for Sydney, Les McMahon, and the selection of Baldwin as Labor candidate for the seat. This was followed by other Labor Right MPs in Sydney's Inner West similarly being usurped by left candidates."]}, {"page": "Tanya Plibersek", "response": ["Plibersek was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election, aged 28, retaining the Division of Sydney for the ALP following the retirement of Peter Baldwin.

In the lead-up to the ballot she \"wrote to each branch member three or four times, attended branch meetings virtually every night, gave talks to community groups, and contributed to three candidates' debates\"."]}, {"page": "Graham Richardson", "response": ["During Richardson's time as General Secretary, there were significant battles over factional control of a number of inner city Labor branches. Peter Baldwin, a Labor member of the Legislative Council and a member of the socialist-left faction, was bashed by unknown assailants in his home on 16 July 1980. Baldwin had earlier initiated inquiries into 'rorts' in the Enmore and other branches. Police began investigation into the assault on Baldwin, and included matters relating to the affairs of the Labor Party Enmore branch. Five people, including Joe Meissner and Tom Domican were charged with various offences. Richardson, in a later interview, confirmed that at the time he wrote to Attorney-General Frank Walker and all other Cabinet Ministers in the Wran Government to ask that the case be dropped on the grounds that it was a Labor Party and not a police matter. Even the Magistrate, was approached.

The traditional base for the Soft Left has been rank-and-file Labor activists. Strategically, it has advocated a continuation of the Baldwinite bottom-up strategy of mobilising the grassroots membership to win party positions. The large Australian trade union, United Voice supported the Soft Left until 2010. In 2014 the sub-faction in New South Wales was led by Paul Lynch, and it currently still exists in New South Wales with the support of the CFMEU. The Soft Left continues to enjoy the support of the majority of Labor Party members in Western Sydney and Newcastle."]}, {"page": "List of people from Aldershot", "response": ["* Peter Baldwin - Australian politician "]}]}}
