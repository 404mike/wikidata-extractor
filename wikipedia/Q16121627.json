After some success in regional tournaments in the late 1960s and early 1970s, she began to play in international tournaments.  She was a member of the Great Britain Curtis Cup team in both 1974 and 1976, represented England in the 1975 European Team Championships, and played for Great Britain & Ireland in the 1976 Espirito Santo Trophy.In 1976, while still an amateur, Lee-Smith won the inaugural Ladies' British Open (now the Women's British Open).  There were only a handful of professional women golfers in the United Kingdom at the time, and the field was mostly made up of amateurs.  At the end of the year, she was voted Daks Woman Golfer of the Year along with Tegwen Perkins.Lee-Smith turned professional in 1977, and qualified for the LPGA Tour that year.  The Women's Professional Golf Association was formed in 1978, and Lee-Smith joined the tour for its first year in 1979.  She finished 8th on the money list that year, third in 1980, and won the Order of Merit as the leading money winner in both 1981 and 1982. She was voted the 1982 North East Sports Personality Of The Year.\nJenny now resides in Tenterden, Kent, England, with her family. She has three children (Katie, Josh, and Ben) and is married to Sam Lucas.\nIn 2012 Jenny discovered that she had a twin sister living in Northumberland, and has written a book called My Secret Sister about the experience under her married name of Jenny Lucas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jennifer Smith", "response": ["*Jenny Lee Smith (born 1948), English golfer"]}, {"page": "Ladies European Tour", "response": ["|1982 ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=\"right\"|\u00a312,551 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|n/a || style=\"text-align:center;\"|n/a || style=\"text-align:center;\"|n/a || |", "|1981 ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=\"right\"|\u00a313,518 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|n/a || style=\"text-align:center;\"|n/a || style=\"text-align:center;\"|n/a || |"]}, {"page": "Women's British Open", "response": ["|1982 ||  || Marta Figueras-Dotti (a) ||  || Royal Birkdale || align=center|296 ||  || 1 stroke ||  Rosie Jones Jenny Lee Smith || align=center|\u00a323,000 || align=center|(\u00a36,000) || ", "|1976 ||  || Jenny Lee Smith (a) ||  || Fulford || align=center|299 ||  || 2 strokes ||  Mary McKenna (a) || align=center| || align=center|(\u00a3210) || "]}, {"page": "Jennifer Lee", "response": ["* Jenny Lee Smith (born 1948), English golfer"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Ladies Open", "response": ["|1982||LET || Portstewart || Londonderry ||  Linda Bowman || align=right|225 || align=center|+3 || Playoff ||  Jenny Lee Smith || ", "|1980||LET || Royal Portrush || Antrim ||  Muriel Thomson || align=right|236 || align=center|+8 || 4 strokes ||  Dale Reid Jenny Lee Smith || "]}, {"page": "List of female golfers", "response": ["| Jenny Lee Smith||1948\u2013"]}, {"page": "Fulford Golf Club", "response": ["In 1976 Fulford hosted the inaugural Women's British Open, won by Jenny Lee Smith."]}, {"page": "Marta Figueras-Dotti", "response": [" Jenny Lee Smith"]}, {"page": "Ford Ladies' Classic", "response": ["| 1982 || Woburn GCC, Duke's Course || Jenny Lee Smith ||  "]}, {"page": "British Women's Matchplay", "response": ["|1981 ||Moor Park GC, Hertfordshire || Jenny Lee Smith ||  || 3 & 2 ||  Beverly Lewis || align=right|3,000"]}, {"page": "Ladies Jersey Open", "response": ["|1983 || Debbie Dowling ||  || 215 (+2) ||align=center| 1 stroke ||  Jenny Lee Smith ||align=right| \u00a3900\t"]}, {"page": "British Olivetti Tournament", "response": ["|  Jenny Lee Smith"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Ann Classic", "response": ["|1981 ||  Muriel Thomson || 293 (+1) || 1 stroke ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|1,500", "|1980 ||  Cathy Panton || 289 (\u221211) || 5 strokes ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|1,500"]}, {"page": "1984 Ladies European Tour", "response": ["| 8 Jun || British Olivetti Tournament || England ||  Jenny Lee Smith (10) || 294 (+6) || 1 stroke ||  Rae Hast || align=right|1,500 || "]}, {"page": "1983 Ladies European Tour", "response": ["| 7 Jul || Colt Cars Jersey Open || Jersey ||  Debbie Dowling (1) || 215 (+2) || 1 stroke ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|890 || "]}, {"page": "United Friendly Tournament", "response": ["|1982 || Walmley GC ||  Beverley New (a) || 212 (\u22121) || 2 strokes ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|"]}, {"page": "McEwan's Lager Welsh Classic", "response": ["|1981 || Whitchurch GC ||  Jenny Lee Smith || 216 (E) || 2 strokes ||  Muriel Thomson || align=right|1,500"]}, {"page": "1982 Ladies European Tour", "response": ["The Order of Merit was won for the second time by Jenny Lee Smith, who again dominated the season with one win and five runner-up finishes; her \u00a312,551 in prize money put her more than \u00a35,500 clear of runner-up Rosie Jones.", "| 9 May || Ford Ladies Classic || England ||  Jenny Lee Smith (9) || 305 (+9) || 4 strokes ||  Dale Reid || align=right|3,000 || ", "| 30 May || Smirnoff Ulster Open || Northern Ireland ||  Linda Bowman (1) || 225 (+3) || Playoff ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|1,000 || ", "| 18 Jun || United Friendly Insurance Championship || England ||  Beverley New (1, a) || 212 (\u22121) || 2 strokes ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|1,500 || ", "|23 Jul || Ladies Spanish Open || Spain ||  Rosie Jones (2) || 224 (+8) || 5 strokes ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|900 || ", "| 31 Jul || Pretty Polly Women's British Open || England ||  Marta Figueras-Dotti (1, a) || 296 (E) || 1 stroke ||  Rosie Jones Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|6,000 || ", "| 12 Sep || Moben Kitchens Classic || England ||  Cathy Panton (6) || 216 (\u22123) || 1 stroke ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=right|1,000 || ", "| 1 ||  Jenny Lee Smith || align=center|12,551 || align=center|"]}, {"page": "1981 Ladies European Tour", "response": ["The Order of Merit was won by Jenny Lee Smith, who dominated the season with three wins and four runner-up finishes; her \u00a313,518 in prize money put her more than \u00a35,000 clear of runner-up Cathy Panton.
