She said about the experience: \"The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I had to do was let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't trying to get away from anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place\".Katie Melua interview, Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick, 5 May 2010", "Melua's fourth album, The House, was released on 24 May 2010.

The song was one of the early demos of the Ray Of Light album from 1997, produced by Greg Fitzgerald and Rick Nowells in late 1997 before William Orbit's involvement in the project \"Ray Of Light\". In 2002 it was rumored to be the new recorded song from Madonna for the James Bond movie, and the leaked demo even got some airplay. In early 2005 it was also rumored to be Madonna's new single from her then upcoming album Confessions On A Dancefloor. The song has since been recorded by English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, as revealed by Peter Magennis in an interview with Greg Fitzgerald for his July 2008 cover feature for UK magazine, Record Collector (issue #351).

Oddly, the CMRRA lists them all, along with Susan Leonard, as co-writers together on one song work# 732670. The ASCAP database lists only Madonna and William Orbit as writers, with the song listed as \"Cuidado Con Mi Corazon\".  In September 2010, another supposed demo leaked. This file was titled \"Corazon\" and contains Madonna singing over typical William Orbit synths.

Madonna confirmed in a 2005 interview with Attitude that the track was also supposed to be on the album but was axed because it gave her \"the wrong tingles\". When the song leaked onto the internet on June 3, 2006, it became clear that the song \"Bubble Universe\" from William Orbit's album Hello Waveforms was actually based on the same instrumental track.
