According to British historian Robin Blackburn, the phrase allude to the thousands of ex-slaves in the British ranks organized as the Corps of Colonial Marines, who had been liberated by the British and demanded to be placed in the battle line \"where they might expect to meet their former masters.\" Mark Clague, a professor of musicology at the University of Michigan, argues that the \"middle two verses of Key's lyric vilify the British enemy in the War of 1812\" and \"in no way glorifies or celebrates slavery.\" Clague writes that \"For Key ... the British mercenaries were scoundrels and the Colonial Marines were traitors who threatened to spark a national insurrection.\" This harshly anti-British nature of Verse 3 led to its omission in sheet music in World War\u00a0I, when the British and the U.S. were allies. Responding to the assertion of writer Jon Schwarz of The Intercept that the song is a \"celebration of slavery\", Clague argues that the American forces at the battle consisted of a mixed group of White Americans and African Americans, and that \"the term \u201cfreemen,\u201d whose heroism is celebrated in the fourth stanza, would have encompassed both.\""]}, {"page": "Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville", "response": ["Historians of the slave trade and the abolitionist movement, including David Brion Davis, Roger Anstey, Robin Blackburn, and Stephen Tomkins argue that Dundas's actions were a tactic designed to delay rather than facilitate abolition. They maintain that when Dundas inserted the word \"gradual\" into the debate he subverted the British abolitionist movement. According to Davis, 'By making the abolition of the slave trade dependent on colonial reforms, Dundas suggested possibilities for indefinite delay.' Alternative measures were proposed later in the 1790s.  Dundas spoke against specific proposals tabled in 1796, while reiterating his support for abolition in principle and then abstaining from the vote.  The loss of momentum was connected to the renewal of war with revolutionary France, which between 1794 and 1801 was committed to complete abolition."]}, {"page": "Alexander Cockburn", "response": ["It was at Oxford and the circles he mixed in thereafter that Cockburn became good friends with Robin Blackburn, as well as other left-wing writers like Tariq Ali, Tom Nairn, and Perry Anderson. Cockburn graduated in 1963 and worked in London as a journalist associated with the New Left Review. Alexander helped in the early re-shaping of New Left Review, joining the editorial committee and becoming managing editor in 1966, while he held a job as an assistant editor at the Times Literary Supplement and moved to the New Statesman in 1967.", "His early published work was as a co-editor to his friend Robin Blackburn, together they first worked on The Incompatibles: Trade Union Militancy and the Consensus (1967). In Blackburn's words the first project \"brought together trade-union organizers, leftwing journalists including Paul Foot, Marxist economists and two liberals\u2014Michael Frayn and Philip Toynbee\u2014who mocked the demonization of union activists by Labour as well as Conservative pundits.\" Looking back, Blackburn writes: \"Sales were reasonable, not amazing; but the book did register a syndicalist militancy that was to upset three British governments, those of Wilson, Heath and Callaghan.\" The second jointly edited collection was Student Power: Problems, Diagnosis, Action (1969), which compiled contributions from such figures as Herbert Marcuse, Perry Anderson, and Tom Nairn. It sold 75,000 copies.", "Given that Alexander Cockburn was perceived as a British leftist (even though he was also an Irish citizen) living in the US, he was often compared to Christopher Hitchens, who had been a Trotskyist in Britain. The two of them were close friends in the 1980s as Hitchens had just arrived and Cockburn had been in the country for a decade already and was well situated to give Hitchens advice. They would meet regularly in Greenwich Village. Robin Blackburn remarked \"Alexander sort of invented Christopher. He showed him what could be done.\" Along with Ben Sonnenberg, Cockburn became co-godfather to Christopher's son Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens.Cockburn, A; The Golden Age Is in Us: Journeys and Encounters, 1995, p. 112. Reciprocally, Christopher Hitchens was godfather to Henry Cockburn, the son of Patrick Cockburn and Alexander Cockburn's nephew. Nevertheless, there were ideological differences which opened up between them early on. Cockburn would later note that Hitchens \"wrote some really awful stuff in the early 90s about how indigenous peoples\u2014Indians in the Americas\u2014were inevitably going to be rolled over by the wheels of Progress and should not be mourned.\"", "* The Incompatibles: Trade Union Militancy and the Consensus (1967) with Robin Blackburn.", "* Student Power (1969) with Robin Blackburn."]}, {"page": "Rudi Dutschke", "response": ["Forty-four socialist-youth delegations from fourteen countries (including the FDJ from East Germany) attended.

For example, as of November 30, 2006, Bear Stearns reported $383.6 billion in liabilities and $11.8 billion in equity, a leverage ratio of approximately 33. This high leverage ratio meant that only a 3% reduction in the value of its assets would render it insolvent.  Unable to withstand the combination of high leverage, reduced access to capital, loss in the value of its MBS securities portfolio, and claims from its hedge funds, Bear Stearns collapsed during March 2008. Historian Robin Blackburn wrote: \"The Wall Street investment banks and brokerages hemorrhaged $175 billion of capital in the period July 2007 to March 2008, and Bear Stearns, the fifth largest, was 'rescued' in March, at a fire-sale price, by JP Morgan Chase with the help of $29 billion of guarantees from the Federal Reserve.\""]}, {"page": "Causes of the Great Recession", "response": ["Complex financing structures called structured investment vehicles (SIV) or conduits enabled banks to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities, including unsold CDO's, off their books.
