He was formerly chairman of Wigan Athletic (2015\u20132019).\nSharpe was born in Wigan. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, and then studied business at Oxford Brookes University. Sharpe's grandfather is Dave Whelan, who took control of Wigan Athletic in February 1995. Whelan made Sharpe a director at Wigan in December 2014, and was appointed as chairman after Whelan's resignation in March 2015. At the age of 23, he became one of the world's youngest football bosses. Sharpe's appointment came with shock and scepticism from both fans and the media as the youngest chairman in English football. Sharpe\u2019s first major decision was to sack Malky Mackay on Easter Monday after a 2\u20130 home defeat to Derby County. With 5 games remaining till the end of the season Sharpe appointed former club captain Gary Caldwell, however Wigan Athletic fell short and were relegated to League One.\nThe 2015\u201316 season, Sharpe and Caldwell\u2019s first full season, saw the club winning League One and being promoted to the Championship. During the following season, Sharpe made the decision to sack Gary Caldwell after a run of 14 games with only two victories. Sharpe appointed Warren Joyce from Manchester United who came highly recommended from well-known names such as Sir Alex Ferguson. However, results didn't improve and, in March 2017, Sharpe sacked Joyce. The club was now in a relegation battle and Graham Barrow took over as caretaker manager.After relegation was confirmed Sharpe made the decision to approach Portsmouth for their manager Paul Cook. Cook was appointed in June 2017. Wigan managed to keep star players and under Cook have dominated League One so far this season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wigan Athletic F.C.", "response": ["R\u00f6sler was sacked in November 2014 with the club in the relegation places, and was replaced by Malky Mackay.

The following month, with Wigan in danger of relegation to League One, Mackay was sacked and replaced by former Wigan captain Gary Caldwell, yet the team ended the season with relegation. The squad changed drastically, including the signings of Will Grigg from Brentford and Reece James from Manchester United. The side lost only once in 23 matches in the second half of the season and won the division, with Grigg the league's top scorer with 25 goals.", "Wigan competed in the 2017\u201318 season of League One in which they finished first resulting in promotion back to the Championship. Their promotion was sealed by a 4\u20130 win against Fleetwood Town. In the 2017\u201318 season of the FA Cup, Wigan reached the quarterfinals, where they were knocked out by Southampton F.C. in a 2\u20130 loss. Notably, Wigan had beaten Manchester City in the Fifth Round Proper at home, winning 1\u20130 due to Will Grigg scoring at the 79th minute.  At the end of the season it was announced that the Whelan family had agreed a deal to sell the club, stadium and training facilities to the Hong Kong-based International Entertainment Corporation (IEC) in a \u00a322m deal. On 2 November 2018 IEC received shareholder approval to complete the acquisition of the football club, bringing to an end the 23 years of Whelan family ownership.
