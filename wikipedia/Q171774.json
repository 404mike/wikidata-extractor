He participated in five World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, and also participated in several non-championship Formula One races.  His Formula One debut was on 11 July 1964, at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch driving a one-litre, 4-cylinder, Cooper\u2013Ford T73, where he finished fourteenth, 24 laps down, after an extended pit\u2013stop due to a gearbox problem. Taylor did not compete in the Formula One World Championship in 1965, but continued to drive in non\u2013championship races. He returned to Grand Prix racing in 1966 driving a two-litre Brabham\u2013BRM for privateer David Bridges. His first race that season was the French Grand Prix at Reims where he scored his one championship point. There followed eighth places at both the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch and the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.Taylor died following a crash at the 1966 German Grand Prix, when the Brabham collided with Jacky Ickx's Matra on the first lap of the race. He emerged from the wreckage badly burned, and died from his injuries four weeks later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jacky Ickx", "response": ["Ickx entered his first Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring in 1966, driving a Matra MS5-Cosworth one-litre Formula Two (F2) car, entered by Ken Tyrrell. However, a first lap collision with John Taylor caused both cars to retire and Taylor later died as a result of burns received in the accident. In 1967, Ickx again drove at the Nurburgring, with an F2 Matra MS7-Cosworth 1.6-litre, also entered by Tyrrell. Despite the greater power of the Formula One cars, only two drivers qualified with a faster time than Ickx: Denny Hulme and Jim Clark. As Ickx was racing in the separate F2 class, he started the race behind all of the Formula One cars, but within four laps of the 28\u00a0km circuit he was up to fifth place, having overtaken 12 Formula One cars. He was forced to retire after 12 laps with a broken front suspension, but set the fastest lap of the F2 runners."]}, {"page": "Cosworth", "response": ["| Mk.XVI || 1963 || 116E || 1,498 cc ||
