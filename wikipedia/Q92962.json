While there, in 1938 he met Jerome Lettvin, a pre-medical student, and the two became close friends.Cf. Conway, Flo; Siegelman, Jim (2005), p.138 Russell was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1938, and he directed Pitts to study with the logician Rudolf Carnap. Pitts met Carnap at Chicago by walking into his office during office hours, and presenting him with an annotated version of Carnap's recent book on logic, The Logical Syntax of Language.Singer, Milton, \"A Tale of Two Amateurs Who Crossed Cultural Frontiers with Boole's Symbolical Algebra\", Semiotica.

Cf. pp. 134\u2013138  Since Pitts did not introduce himself, Carnap spent months searching for him, and, when he found him, he obtained for him a menial job at the university and had Pitts study with him. Pitts at the time was homeless and without income.\"Pitts, Walter\", MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science () He mastered Carnap's abstract logic, then met with and was intrigued by the work of the Russian mathematical physicist Nicolas Rashevsky, who was also at Chicago and was the founder of mathematical biophysics, remodeling biology on the structure of the physical sciences and mathematical logic.Cf. Conway, Flo; Siegelman, Jim (2005), p.139 Pitts also worked closely with the mathematician Alston Scott Householder, who was a member of Rashevsky's group.Cf. Aizawa & SchlatterCf.

In 1940, Von Bonin introduced Lettvin to Warren McCulloch, who would become a professor of psychiatry at Illinois.

Arbib, but the concept had appeared earlier in science fiction such as the 1967 novel Berserker by Fred Saberhagen or the 1950 novellette trilogy The Voyage of the Space Beagle by A. E. van Vogt. The first quantitative engineering analysis of a self-replicating spacecraft was published in 1980 by Robert Freitas, in which the non-replicating Project Daedalus design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a \"seed\" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, and then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each."]}, {"page": "Mary Hesse", "response": ["*(1986) with Michael A.
