World War II disrupted what could have been a successful spell for Stoke but in the first season after the war McGrory's Stoke made their first real attempt to win the First Division. But an ongoing dispute with star winger Stanley Matthews saw him leave for Blackpool just before the end of the season and Stoke went on to lose their must win match against Sheffield United. McGrory remained in charge until 1952 when he ended his 31-year association with the club. He spent a short spell in charge of Merthyr Tydfil leaving after one season due to ill health. He died a year later on 24 May 1954.", "link_mentions": {}}}
