After only making three appearances for the \"Clarets\" he signed for Stoke City in May 1921. He soon became an indispensable part of Tom Mather's first team and was made club captain, skippering the side to promotions in 1926\u201327 and 1932\u201333. He spent 15 seasons as a player for Stoke racking up 511 appearances although he did fail to score a single goal. He took over as Stoke manager in 1935 and in his first season in charge guided Stoke to a highest position finish of 4th. World War II disrupted what could have been a successful spell for Stoke but in the first season after the war McGrory's Stoke made their first real attempt to win the First Division. But an ongoing dispute with star winger Stanley Matthews saw him leave for Blackpool just before the end of the season and Stoke went on to lose their must win match against Sheffield United. McGrory remained in charge until 1952 when he ended his 31-year association with the club. He spent a short spell in charge of Merthyr Tydfil leaving after one season due to ill health. He died a year later on 24 May 1954.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stanley Matthews", "response": ["In 1935\u201336 Matthews continued to improve, and he added the double body swerve technique to his increasing arsenal of tricks. Largely out of the international picture, he put in 45 games for the \"Potters\" as Stoke finished fourth under Bob McGrory \u2013 the club's best ever finish. He played 42 games in 1936\u201337, including the club's record 10\u20133 win over West Brom at the Victoria Ground. At the end of the season he was paid a loyalty bonus of \u00a3650, though the Stoke board initially insisted he was only due \u00a3500 as he had spent his first two years at the club as an amateur \u2013 this attitude left a sour taste in Matthew's mouth."]}, {"page": "Stoke City F.C.", "response": ["Stoke were relegated from the First Division in 1952\u201353; during the season Bob McGrory resigned as the club's manager after 17 years in the role.

However, after seven seasons in the Second Division without promotion, Taylor was sacked. Taylor was shocked at being fired and vowed never to be associated with football again.", "|  Bob McGrory"]}, {"page": "Roy Sproson", "response": ["Sproson played for Stoke City at an amateur level for twelve months in the late 1940s. He was courted by teams such as Aston Villa, West Ham United and Bolton Wanderers. His father wished him to follow in his footsteps and sign for Stoke City. The Stoke manager Bob McGrory promised him a contract after Sproson finished his National service, but after brother Jess introduced him to Port Vale manager Gordon Hodgson, he signed with the Vale for \u00a33 a week while he served his National service. In July 1949 Sproson's time with the Royal Air Force had finished and he signed with Port Vale as a professional. However he had to wait until 11 November 1950 for his debut, in a 1\u20131 draw with Gillingham at Priestfield. He started the last five games of the season after sharing the No. 6 jersey with Jimmy Todd and Bill McGarry."]}, {"page": "Frank Soo", "response": ["Soo featured mainly for the Reserves during the 1934\u201335 campaign, as the forward line of Harry Davies, Joe Johnson, Bobby Liddle, Stanley Matthews and Tommy Sale proved to be highly effective, scoring 60 of the club's 71 league goals on the way to a tenth-place finish. He failed to make a first team appearance between September and 9 March, only returning to the side following a run of three consecutive defeats. He broke his leg during 1935\u201336 pre-season training, but made a speedy recovery to feature in a 2\u20130 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield on 18 September. He found himself a first team regular under new manager Bob McGrory, who utilised him as a left-sided half-back in the place of ageing veteran Harry Sellars. Playing alongside Arthur Turner and Arthur Tutin, Soo would be a part of one of the club's great half-back lines. He played a total of 40 matches that season, helping Stoke to a fourth-place finish, the highest in the club's history."]}, {"page": "Neil Franklin", "response": ["Stoke narrowly missed out on their first league title in 1946\u201347 losing their must win match against Sheffield United 2\u20131. Stoke manager Bob McGrory was becoming frustrated with his side's best players, and after selling Stanley Matthews to Blackpool and his gripe soon turned to Franklin. McGrory wanted him to play the ball earlier rather than keep possession and be more physical in his defensive work which led him to handing the captaincy back to Mould. McGrory's campaign against him eventually led Franklin to announcing his intentions to leave Stoke in the summer of 1949. A world record bid of \u00a330,000 from Hull City was mooted but the Stoke directors rejected Franklin's request and he re-signed four games into the 1949\u201350 season. However, he won a large bet of \u00a3250 which gave him the confidence to make an astonishing announcement to the football world. He declined a place in the England squad for the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, saying that his wife was due to give birth in the summer and he was to spend time playing in Colombia for Independiente Santa Fe."]}, {"page": "Frank Bowyer", "response": ["He was renowned for his powerful volley shot and he top scored for Stoke in 1948\u201349 scoring 21 goals which but him up there with the best in the country.

He top scored again in 1949\u201350 with 15 then with 19 in 1950\u201351. Stoke under new manager Frank Taylor suffered relegation in 1952\u201353 and Bowyer was top goalscorer in 1953\u201354, 1955\u201356 and 1959\u201360 as Stoke failed to gain a return to the top flight. Taylor paid the price for failure and was replaced by Tony Waddington who deemed the 38-year-old Bowyer surplus to requirements and he was released which caused controversy as he was only three goals short of Freddie Steele's record of 140. He ended his career with three years as a player manager of Macclesfield Town."]}, {"page": "Tom Mather", "response": ["Things didn't improve quickly and Stoke suffered relegation to the Third Division North in 1925\u201326 season.

The goals of Charlie Wilson proved invaluable as Stoke began to start pushing for a return to the First Division. Mather gave Stanley Matthews his debut in February 1932. After a number a failed attempts Stoke finished as Second Division champions in 1932\u201333. Mather remained in charge of Stoke for two more seasons before Bob McGrory took over and Mather left in 1935 to join Newcastle United. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Mather attempted to encourage Matthews to join him at Newcastle, but Matthews declined."]}, {"page": "History of Stoke City F.C.", "response": ["By 1934, the club's average attendance had risen to over 23,000, which allowed the club manager, Tom Mather, more transfer funds. Despite this, the core of the side consisted of young local players, such as Matthews, Tommy Sale and Freddie Steele. Mathers resigned from his post in May 1935 to take the managerial job at Newcastle United, ending his 12-year tenure. Bob McGrory was appointed as the club's manager shortly afterward; he had previously played for the club for 14 years. In the 1935\u201336 season, the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division, nine points adrift of champions Sunderland. This was followed by two successive mid-table finishes, in 1936\u201337 and 1937\u201338. The club recorded its record league win, 10\u20133, over West Bromwich Albion in February 1937, in which Steele scored five goals. In April of that year, the club achieved its largest league crowd\u201451,373 against Arsenal.

Bob McGrory resigned as the club's manager in February 1952 after 17 years in the role. His successor, Frank Taylor, consolidated the club's position in the Second Division but was unable to mount a sustained challenge for promotion, although Stoke came close in the 1954\u201355 season, missing by two points.

Blackburn were relegated from the First Division in his first season at the club, 1935\u201336, finishing bottom of the table. He left the club halfway through the subsequent season, 1936\u201337, in which Blackburn finished 12th in the Second Division.", "Bob McGrory, Stoke's manager, re-signed Sale for Stoke in March 1938, initially as cover for Steele, who was injured at the time. Following his return, Sale scored five goals in three games, as he set about regaining his place in the team. He re-established his place in the side, as he scored 18 further goals in the remainder of the 1938\u201339 season. The 1939\u201340 season was suspended due to the outbreak of World War II, however Sale continued his goalscoring exploits with 56 goals (in all competitions) in 1941\u201342 and then 64 goals over the course of two seasons: 1943\u201344 and 1944\u201345. In the latter of these two seasons, Sale netted six times in an 8\u20130 win over Walsall. Despite most of his goals coming from open play, Sale was a penalty specialist; it is reported Sale only missed one penalty in his entire professional career. Sale's last appearance for Stoke came on 8 April 1946, at the age of 35, in a War League game against Sheffield United at Stoke's home ground, the Victoria Ground.
