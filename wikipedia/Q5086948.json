Even though the missionaries had banned traditional music, he learned to play from his brother and other village elders.  His mother also encouraged him through her singing of traditional songs.\nAs a teenager Chartwell moved to the capital, Harare, and became saxophonist with the Salvation Army band.  A little later, in 1986, he joined the world-famous band Thomas Mapfumo & the Blacks Unlimited.  Touring the world for eight years with that band, he was their arranger, mbira player and saxophonist.  From 1994 until his death in 2019, Chartwell based himself in Britain where he continued to teach and play mbira.Chartwell had academic qualifications in music, including a degree in Ethnomusicology from SOAS in London where he also taught for many years.\nChartwell's solo album, released in 2000, is entitled Voices of Ancestors.  He also has several recordings on CD in which he plays with the band Spirit Talk Mbira: Ndonga Mahwe (1997), Nhimbe (1999), Dzoro (2000), and Taanerimwe. Chartwell also worked with Serenoa String Quartet to combine classical string quartet style with traditional African music.\nFrom 2016 until 2019 he was part of the band Kusanganisa, a collaboration with Leandro Maia, Chris Blanden and Nick Sorensen.
