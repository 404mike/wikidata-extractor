For these glaciers, supraglacial water ponds or moves in rivers across the surface of the glacier until it drops down a vertical crevice (a moulin) in the glacier. There it joins subglacial water created by geothermal heat; some portion of the water drains into aquifers below the glacier. Excess subglacial water that cannot drain through sediment or impermeable bedrock as groundwater, moves either through channels eroded into the bed of sediment below the glacier (called Nye channelsThe smaller channels, known as Nye channels, are named after British physicist John Nye.) or through channels upward into the glacial ice (called Rothlisberger channels), eventually flowing out at the ice margin.  On the simplest level, the tunnel valley can be considered a larger-scale version of these phenomena."]}, {"page": "Bubble raft", "response": ["The concept of bubble raft modelling was first presented in 1947 by Nobel Laureate Sir William Lawrence Bragg and John Nye of Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in Proceedings of the Royal Society A.[1] Legend claims that Bragg conceived of bubble raft models while pouring oil into his lawn mower. He noticed that bubbles on the surface of the oil assembled into rafts resembling the {111} plane of close-packed crystals[2]. Nye and Bragg later presented a method of generating and controlling bubbles on the surface of a glycerine-water-oleic acid-triethanolamine solution, in assemblies of 100,000 or more sub-millimeter sized bubbles. In their paper [1], they go on at length about the microstructural phenomena observed in bubble rafts and hypothesized in metals."]}, {"page": "1923 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 26 February \u2013 John Nye, glaciologist (died 2019)"]}, {"page": "Subglacial channel", "response": ["The final type, the N-channel (after John Nye), are those incised into bedrock, perhaps suggesting long-term channel stability under some glaciers.Gray, H H. 2001.

Her parents taught English, but while they were studying at University of Bristol, they had become friends with Cecil Powell, a physicist. She was inspired to study physics, and also to follow her interest in mountains.  She studied physics as an undergraduate and for her Ph.D. (awarded 1972) at University of Bristol modelled how ice flowed over mountains, supervised by John Nye.  After working briefly in X-ray crystallography at University of Dundee, and then as a researcher at the University of East Anglia with Geoffrey Boulton, she joined the Institute of Hydrology for 11 years from 1975. She enjoyed fieldwork and was able to carry it out in mountains in Scotland, Norway, Austria and Canada. However, until the late 1980s only men were permitted at the UK station in Antarctica or distant arctic field sites."]}, {"page": "John Frederick Nye", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Nye (scientist)"]}, {"page": "Oral History of British Science", "response": ["* John Nye (scientist) (Physicist, Theoretical glaciologist)"]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (J)", "response": ["*John Nye (scientist)"]}, {"page": "Nye (surname)", "response": ["* John Nye (scientist) (1923-2019), English physicist and glaciologist", "* John Nye (cricketer) (1914\u20132002), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "2019 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*8 January \u2013 John Nye, 95, glaciologist, heart failure."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2019", "response": ["*John Nye, 95, British glaciologist, heart failure.John F.
