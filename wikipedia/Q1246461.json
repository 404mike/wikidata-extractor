The Estermann measure, a measure of the central symmetry of a convex set in the Euclidean plane, is named after him.He was born in Neubrandenburg, Germany, \"to keen Zionists who named him in honour of Herzl.\" His doctorate, completed in 1925, was supervised by Hans Rademacher. He spent most of his career at University College London, eventually as a professor. Heini Halberstam, Klaus Roth and Robert Charles Vaughan were Ph.D. students of his.\nThough Estermann left Germany in 1929, before the Nazis seized power in 1933, some historians count him among the early emigrants who fled Nazi Germany.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Goldbach's conjecture", "response": ["The strong Goldbach conjecture is much more difficult than the weak Goldbach conjecture.  Using Vinogradov's method, Nikolai Chudakov, Johannes van der Corput, and Theodor Estermann showed that almost all even numbers can be written as the sum of two primes (in the sense that the fraction of even numbers which can be so written tends towards 1).  In 1930, Lev Schnirelmann proved that any natural number greater than 1 can be written as the sum of not more than  prime numbers, where  is an effectively computable constant; see Schnirelmann density.Schnirelmann, L.\u00a0G.

Schnirelmann's constant is the lowest number  with this property. Schnirelmann himself obtained \u00a0<\u00a0.  This result was subsequently enhanced by many authors, such as Olivier Ramar\u00e9, who in 1995 showed that every even number  is in fact the sum of at most 6 primes. The best known result currently stems from the proof of the weak Goldbach conjecture by Harald Helfgott, which directly implies that every even number  is the sum of at most 4 primes."]}, {"page": "Quadratic irrational number", "response": ["The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is not actually required to prove the result, however.

John von Neumann had taken a position at the California Institute of Technology in 1929 because he felt anti-semitism in Germany was affecting his career. By 1933, von Neumann had a position at Princeton; though he had maintained ties with Germany until then, he canceled his scheduled lectures in Berlin after Hitler became Chancellor. Other early emigrants from Germany included Theodor Estermann, Hans Freudenthal, Eberhard Hopf, Heinz Hopf, Herman M\u00fcntz, Wilhelm Meyer and Abraham Plessner.
