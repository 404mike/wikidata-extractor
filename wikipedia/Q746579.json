As of September 2021 he held the position of Technical Director at the IFAB.During his career as a prominent referee in England, Elleray officiated a number of notable matches, including the FA Cup Final, the highest domestic honour for an English referee. Due to his Oxbridge background and \"day job\" as a teacher at a public school, Elleray has been described as \"schoolmasterly\" and \"posh\" by the press.

This was achieved with impressive victories away to Bolton, and victories at home to Wrexham and (then) Premier League Nottingham Forest before the infamous semi-final tie with Middlesbrough at Old Trafford which ended in a 3\u20133 draw. Chesterfield even had a contentious goal that was not given by Referee David Elleray; Jonathan Howard took a shot which hit the underside of the crossbar and appeared to cross the line and yet the goal was never given. Had it been awarded as a goal it would have put Chesterfield 3\u20131 up against ten-man Middlesbrough (after the earlier dismissal of Vladim\u00edr Kinder) with just over 20 minutes remaining. As it was, Middlesbrough equalised to make it 2\u20132 after 90 minutes, and it finished 3\u20133 after extra time. Jamie Hewitt's last minute equaliser in extra time resulted in Duncan celebrating so wildly he lost his glasses. Chesterfield were defeated in the replay 3\u20130 at Hillsborough.

In October 1997, after a spell at AS Cannes, he made the move to English football, signing for West Ham United for \u00a3250,000. Signed by manager Harry Redknapp to give more options for strikers, Abou made his West Ham debut on 9 November 1997, in a 2\u20131 away defeat to Chelsea coming on as a substitute for John Moncur. His opening West Ham goal came on 6 January 1998, in the League Cup. In a fifth-round game at the Boleyn Ground, Abou came on as a substitute for Paul Kitson to score their only goal in a 2\u20131 defeat. In the following game, on 10 January 1998, Abou scored twice as West Ham beat Barnsley 6\u20130. Abou received his only red card in the next game, a 1\u20130 away defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Fouling Ramon Vega in an off-the-ball incident, Abou was dismissed by referee David Elleray. Abou finished the 1997\u201398 season with 6 goals from 26 games, including two on the last day of the season in a 4\u20133 home defeat of Leicester City. West Ham fans would boo Abou whenever he scored, making an \"Abooooooooo\" noise.

With Chelsea having to attack, it left gaps in defence and United eventually won 4\u20130. This was nevertheless sufficient for Chelsea to compete in the 1994\u201395 Cup Winners' Cup, since United had already qualified for the Champions League.
