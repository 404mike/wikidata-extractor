During the afternoon, when French skirmishers attacked British cannons, the division's light infantry brigadeunder the command of Major-General Frederick Adammoved forward to drive them back and protect the guns. Afterwards, it and the KGL brigade advanced to a position behind Ch\u00e2teau d'Hougoumont, an important tactical strongpoint in front of the British line. Formed into infantry squares and under fire from French skirmishers, the brigades assisted in the ch\u00e2teau's defence, and fired at French cavalry attacking other British forces. The KGL brigade also fended off several direct cavalry attacks. At around 19:30, the final French attack began when the Imperial Guard's Middle Guard advanced on the British right flank and engaged the British Foot Guard regiments. Adam responded by wheeling his brigade left into a line to face the French flank. His troops, particularly the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot, fired volleys into the French in a fierce firefight, and then charged. This, in conjunction with the resistance of the British foot guards, halted the French attack and caused the Middle Guard to retreat. With Hanoverian troops covering their flank, Adam's brigade advanced after the French before a general advance by the Anglo-Dutch army. With the French in retreat, the Hanoverian and KGL troops cleared the woods around the Ch\u00e2teau d'Hougoumont, while other elements of the Hanoverian brigade advanced. Adam's brigade, with one Hanoverian battalion in support, advanced towards the La Belle Alliance inn, the centre of the French position. Near the inn, Imperial Guard units, including elements of the Old Guard, had formed a square as a rearguard. Adam's troops engaged them and forced them to retreat.
