In these procedures coca leaves and datura plants were used to manage pain as the person had dull primitive tools cut open their skull. In 400 BC the physician Hippocrates made accounts of using different wines to sedate patients while trepanning. In 60 AD Dioscorides, a physician, pharmacologist, and botanist, detailed how mandrake, henbane, opium, and alcohol were used to put patients to sleep during trepanning. In 972 AD two brother surgeons in Paramara, now India, used \"samohine\" to sedate a patient while removing a small tumor and awoke the patient by pouring onion and vinegar in the patient's mouth. Since then, multiple cocktails have been derived in order to sedate a patient during a brain surgery. The most recent form of neuroanesthesia is the combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen. This was discovered in the 18th century by Humphry Davy and brought into the operating room by Astley Cooper."]}, {"page": "1841", "response": ["* February 12 \u2013 Sir Astley Cooper, British surgeon and anatomist (b. 1768)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of medicine and medical technology", "response": ["* 1768\u20131843 \u2013 Astley Cooper surgeon lectures principles and practice"]}, {"page": "William H.

Barry's short stature, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led many to suspect that Barry was a young boy not past puberty, and the University Senate initially attempted to block Barry's application for the final examinations due to this apparent youth. However, the Earl of Buchan, a friend of Dr Fryer and Barry's late namesake, persuaded the Senate to relent and Barry qualified Medicinae Doctor (MD) in 1812.

Another was held in Watford which was attended by wealthy and influential peers of the realm who had property interests on the planned route of the line: the Earl of Essex was keen to protect his Cassiobury Estate from invasion by the \"iron horse\", as was the Earl of Clarendon, who owned The Grove Estate. The anatomist Sir Astley Cooper was also in attendance, intent on preventing the new railway from cutting across his Gadebridge Estate. On 22 June 1832, Lord Brownlow of Ashridge voiced his opposition in the House of Lords to \"the forcing of the proposed railway through the land and property of so great a proportion of dissentient landowners.\" The L&BR Company's first application for an Act of Parliament to construct the line was rejected in 1832, due to pressure from landowners and road and canal interests.", "The railway route proposals through Hertfordshire were modified; a second act was approved in May 1833, and the line received royal assent.
