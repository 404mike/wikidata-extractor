Most of his racing career was spent driving saloon cars, mainly as a privateer in the British Touring Car Championship. He also entered selected rounds of the British Formula One Championship. His most competitive years in the BTCC came in the 1980s, where he was often a front runner in his Class A 3.5 litre Rover Vitesse. In 1987 he finished as runner-up in his class, finishing sixth overall in his ageing Rover. His final year in the BTCC came in 1992, entering his own-built Ford Sierra.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oulton Park", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1978 British Formula One Championship", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=\"left\"|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1979 British Formula One Championship", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=\"left\"|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1992 British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1980 British Formula One Championship", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=\"left\"|  Dennis Leech            "]}, {"page": "1991 British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "Andy Neate", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Ian Bankhurst Richard Bay Stephen Keating Dennis Leech Richard Stanton"]}, {"page": "1990 British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1969 British Saloon Car Championship", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1971 British Saloon Car Championship", "response": ["|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1981 British Saloon Car Championship", "response": ["|Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1982 British Saloon Car Championship", "response": ["| Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1983 British Saloon Car Championship", "response": ["| Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1984 British Saloon Car Championship", "response": ["| Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "1985 British Saloon Car Championship", "response": ["| Dennis Leech", "|  Dennis Leech", "|align=left|  Dennis Leech"]}, {"page": "Karl Jones", "response": ["!
