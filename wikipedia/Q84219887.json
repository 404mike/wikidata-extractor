She was known for her pastels and modernistic paintings.\nBorn in Sussex, England on 27 November 1904, Stoner moved to Tasmania in 1921.She studied art at Hobart Technical College from 1925 to 1929, her teachers being Lucien Dechaineux and Mildred Lovett.  Her teaching career began at Launceston Technical College from 1936 to 1939. She returned to Hobart Technical College in 1940 and taught there during Jack Carington Smith's time as head of school, until 1964.Two of her watercolours of flowers were included in an exhibition of drawings held Modern Art Centre, Sydney in 1933. The Sydney Morning Herald critic commented that Stoner \"neglects the detailed treatment of petal textures which would have lured most artists; and, instead, merely indicates those textures, and concentrates on the effect of heavy outlines, relieved with tonal contrasts of a more general nature. The total impression created is one which mingles tenderness admirably with strength. The colour is highly sensitive and refined.\"She exhibited her work regularly in the annual exhibition arranged by the Art Society of Tasmania. In 1946 she illustrated a children's book, Fairy Fancies, by Athalie Jean Bell.A retrospective exhibition of her work and that of fellow Tasmanian painter Edith Holmes was held in the Arts Council Galleries in Canberra in 1984. Curated by Hendrick Kolenberg of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the exhibition brought together 149 artworks. In his review, art critic Sasha Grishin commented: \"For me, the great strength in her work is her quality as a draughtsman.\"Examples of Stoner's work are on permanent display in the Henry Hunter Galleries at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Australian women artists", "response": ["*Dorothy Stoner (1904\u20131992), painter"]}, {"page": "Mildred Lovett", "response": ["In 1901, Lovett moved to Sydney to study under Julian Ashton at Sydney Art School, where she became his assistant teacher. In 1904 she returned to Hobart and began teaching in the Art Department of the Technical College, where she gained a full-time post with a salary of \u00a350 a year, under the leadership of Lucien Dechaineux. By 1925 she had been appointed an art instructor there. Many of her students became noted artists, including Edith Holmes and Dorothy Stoner."]}, {"page": "Edith Lilla Holmes", "response": ["In the 1930s, Holmes operated a studio in Hobart together with Lovett, Florence Rodway, Dorothy Stoner, Ethel Nicholls, and Violet Vimpany. Her work was well-received by critics and from 1938 to 1951, she had seven exhibitions in Melbourne, where she met artists Danila Vassilieff, Eveline Syme, George Bell, and Arnold Shaw. Holmes' annual exhibitions from 1927 to 1972 were supported by the Tasmanian Art Society, whose council Holmes was a member of from 1930 to 1952. She was among the founding members of the Tasmanian Group of Painters in 1940. In 1954, Holmes won a special prize at an art competition commemorating the sesquicentenary of Hobart. In 1958, she held an exhibition at Tasmania House in London. Two of Holmes' self-portraits, painted in the 1930s, are housed at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Holmes was also an active participant of the Victoria League, the English Speaking Union, and the Women's Non-Party League of Tasmania. She was a life member of the United Nations Association's Tasmanian division."]}, {"page": "Violet Vimpany", "response": ["During the 1930s Vimpany shared a studio at 76 Collins Street in Hobart with other women artists of the time, including Edith Holmes, Mildred Lovett, Ethel Nicholls, Florence Rodway, and Dorothy Stoner. It is presumed that during this time Holmes painted the artwork Portrait of Violet Vimpany (Masterpiece Fine Art Gallery Hobart)."]}, {"page": "Velasquez Gallery", "response": ["* 1946, 8 \u2013 19 January: Three Tasmanian artists; Winifred Biggins, Eileen Brooker, Dorothy Stoner"]}]}}
