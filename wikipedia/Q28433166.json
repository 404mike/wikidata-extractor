He was educated at Sydney Boys' High School where he won a number of awards, notably for debating. He studied medicine and physiology at The University of Sydney between 1942 and 1947, however he did not graduate. McInnes also took Philosophy 1 with the Challis Professor of Philosophy John Anderson whose influence permeated several generations of students, known as the Andersonians. During World War II, the intellectual life of Sydney was still centred on the university, but towards the end of the war, a small group of students began to meet in various houses to discuss a broad range of intellectual concerns. Along with McInnes, the informal membership of the group included leading students in English, French, German, History, Philosophy and Science such as Paul Foulkes, Ernest Foulkes, Henry Harris, Noel Hush, George Munster, Jim Baker and Bill Maidment. This undergraduate association went by various names, notably The Apostles, though Anderson reportedly coined the name \u2018The Poseurs Push\u2019 for the group. McInnes established lifelong friendships with many of these students, as well as others who were also influenced by Anderson, notably Eugene Kamenka. McInnes contributed to student publications, chiefly Hermes and Honi Soit, for a time edited by fellow student Murray Sayle, who soon left the university to start his long and distinguished career as a journalist. At this time McInnes also became close to Harry Hooton, who was drawn to intellectual circles around Sydney University and opposed the generally favoured realist philosophy of Anderson and its activist offshoot, the Libertarian Society. McInnes and Hooton carried on corresponding for many years.", "In 1947, McInnes left Sydney with his lifelong companion June (Julie) Turner (1924-2005). He moved to Cairns to work as a journalist for The Cairns Post, sharing a house with Murray Sayle who was also working on the newspaper at the time. In 1948 he left Australia for Calcutta to become a deputy editor for one of India's oldest newspapers, The Statesman. In 1952 he was promoted to editor of the Calcutta-based financial newspaper Capital. Following several extended trips to Europe, he moved permanently to France in 1955, living in Paris and later in the Fontainebleau area for ten years.Peter C. Grundy, \"Tribute, Neil McInnes\".
