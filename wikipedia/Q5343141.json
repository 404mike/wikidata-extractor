Gothard himself represented Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship in 1927. He was an able rugby player but as a result of injury took to playing hockey instead. He was captain of Burton Hockey Club from 1933 to 1939. During the Second World War he played four cricket matches for Nottinghamshire in 1943. He was captain of Burton Hockey Club again from 1946 to 1947, and was a regular player for the club after the war. He played hockey for Derbyshire 30 times and was a trialist for the \"Midlands\".Gothard became cricket captain for Derbyshire in the 1947 season and made his first-class debut at the age of 42 at the end of May against Northamptonshire. An innings victory marked the start of a good run for the Derbyshire team. Gothard was a strict disciplinarian, and they finished in fifth place in the 1947 County Championship. Against Middlesex Gothard took a hat-trick, including the wicket of Bill Edrich, one of the season's top scorers. During the 1948 season, Gothard clean bowled Don Bradman at Derby. At the end of the 1948 season, when Derbyshire finished sixth, he retired from first-class cricket. Gothard was a right-arm medium-pace bowler who took 18 first-class wickets at an average of 40.55 and a best performance of 3\u201384. He was a right-handed batsman who batted in the lower-order. He played 63 innings in 45 first-class matches with one half-century and an average of 12.34.Gothard was later secretary and treasurer of the club. He died in Birmingham at the age of 74.\nGothard's son, Squadron Leader Edward Leigh Gothard, MBE, played first class cricket for both the Royal Air Force and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Derbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392."]}, {"page": "David Skinner (cricketer)", "response": ["Skinner was appointed as county captain for the 1949 season in accordance with the tradition of amateur captaincy. Skinner himself was a modest performer, though in this he was no different from the other amateurs \u2013 Gilbert Hodgkinson and Edward Gothard \u2013 who had captained an otherwise entirely professional side since the Second World War. The move was not successful, and Derbyshire, missing the all-round skills of George Pope, fell to 15th place in the County Championship.Wisden 1999, p. 1490. Towards the end of the season other amateurs appeared after fulfilling their schoolmastering commitments, and Skinner did not play in the last few matches of the season and never played first-class cricket again. Skinner was a right-handed batsman in the lower-middle-order and played 36 innings in 23 first-class matches with an average of 13.57 and a top score of 63. He was a right-arm off-break bowler who bowled occasionally taking 2 first-class wickets at an average of 91.David Skinner at Cricket Archive"]}, {"page": "David Brooke-Taylor", "response": ["Brooke-Taylor was born at Bakewell, Derbyshire. He was educated at Cheltenham College. He started playing for Derbyshire in the second XI and for the Club and Ground in 1938, and continued doing so in 1939. After the war he played similar games but made his first-class debut for Derbyshire against Nottinghamshire in July 1947 as captain. He was standing in for Edward Gothard according to the Derbyshire tradition that the captain be an amateur. He scored 1 in the first innings and 38 in the second. He played two more first-class matches that season, captaining one of them against Surrey and making his top score of 61 not out against Northamptonshire. In 1948 he played regularly in the County squad and in miscellaneous matches. In 1949 he played for the second XI in the Minor Counties Championship and in  two final first-class matches in August 1949.
