Booth brings up a recent mugging that Liam was questioned about, but Bianca insists he was not involved and does not know the gang who committed the crime, and she leaves, thinking Booth is trying to get her to incriminate Liam. However, Bianca later tells Booth that Liam was involved in the mugging. After Liam and the rest of the gang are arrested, Booth and her colleague DS Bain (Joe Tucker) question Liam about his involvement. When Bianca's daughter Tiffany Butcher (Maisie Smith) is given an MP3 player by one of the gang members and Liam receives death threats, Booth comes to their house and gets Tiffany to identify gang member, Ali. In 2016, Booth arrests Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) after it emerges he has been in a relationship with 14-year-old Linzi Bragg (Amy-Leigh Hickman). She questions him the following day and he tells her that he has not had sex with Linzi and did not know how old she was. Booth charges Jay with the possession of indecent images of children, due to there being sexually explicit photos and a video of Linzi on his mobile phone. In 2017, when Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) thinks she has been raped by Keegan Baker (Zack Morris), she and her stepmother, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), report it to the police.
