She is the most successful Miss England contestant ever, having won four of the ten qualifying rounds in the final of the competition, including the swimwear round. Tyrrell studied medicine at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge and received first-class honours, prizes and distinctions.Having declared herself a feminist, Tyrrell faced criticism from Germaine Greer, herself a Cambridge University graduate. Tyrrell is a women's rights advocate, believing that women should be able to make their own choices and that women and men should collaborate to support one another. Tyrrell supports various charities and her Beauty with a Purpose charity project for Miss World was in aid of the homeless. She slept rough on the streets to raise awareness of homelessness and is an ambassador, for homeless charities, in both Oxford and Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Murray Edwards College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Carina Tyrrell, British-Swiss public health physician and former Miss United Kingdom of Miss World"]}, {"page": "List of physicians", "response": ["* Carina Tyrrell"]}, {"page": "International School of Geneva", "response": ["*Carina TyrrellPhysician and clinical fellow at the Cambridge University Epidemiology Unit; model and former \"Miss England\""]}, {"page": "Miss United Kingdom", "response": ["| Carina Tyrrell"]}, {"page": "Miss England", "response": ["thumb|Carina Tyrrell, the 2014 winner", "Carina Tyrrell, who was a medical student when she won her national title in 2014, competed in Miss World 2014 when the competition was held in her home country at ExCeL London.
