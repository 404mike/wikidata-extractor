After hearing reports that Alaric had entered the city\u2014possibly aided by Gothic slaves inside\u2014there were reports that Emperor Honorius (safe in Ravenna) broke into \"wailing and lamentation\" but quickly calmed once \"it was explained to him that it was the city of Rome that had met its end and not 'Roma',\" his pet fowl. Writing from Bethlehem, St. Jerome (Letter 127.12, to the lady Principia) lamented: \"A dreadful rumour reached us from the West. We heard that Rome was besieged, that the citizens were buying their safety with gold . . . The city which had taken the whole world was itself taken; nay, it fell by famine before it fell to the sword.\" Nonetheless, Christian apologists also cited how Alaric ordered that anyone who took shelter in a Church was to be spared. When liturgical vessels were taken from the basilica of St. Peter and Alaric heard of this, he ordered them returned and had them ceremoniously restored in the church. If the account from the historian Orosius can be seen as accurate, there was even a celebratory recognition of Christian unity by way of a procession through the streets where Romans and barbarians alike \"raised a hymn to God in public\"; historian Edward James concludes that such stories are likely more political rhetoric of the \"noble\" barbarians than a reflection of historical reality."]}, {"page": "Germanic peoples", "response": ["The century after the Batavian Revolt saw mostly peace between the Germanic peoples and Rome. In 83 CE, Emperor Domitian of the Flavian dynasty attacked the Chatti north of Mainz (Mogontiacum). This war would last until 85 CE. Following the end of the war with the Chatti and a failed revolt by the army in the Roman province of Germania superior, Domitian reduced the number of Roman soldiers on the upper Rhine and shifted the Roman military to guarding the Danube frontier, beginning the construction of the limes, the longest fortified border in the empire. The period afterwards was peaceful enough that the emperor Trajan reduced the number of soldiers on the frontier. According to Edward James, the Romans appear to have reserved the right to choose rulers among the barbarians: the Quadi asked Roman permission to install Furtius as their king. When the Quadi later expelled and replaced Furtius with a new king without Roman approval, the Romans attacked and captured the new king, sending him into exile."]}, {"page": "New Wave science fiction", "response": ["The science fiction academic Edward James pointed out differences between the British and American SF New Wave. He believed that the former was, through J. G. Ballard and Michael Moorcock, mainly associated with a specific magazine with a set programme that had little subsequent influence. James further noted that even the London-based American writers of the time, such as Samuel R. Delany, Thomas M. Disch, and John Sladek, had their own agendas. James asserted the American New Wave did not reach the status of a movement but was rather a confluence of talent arising simultaneously that introduced new ideas and better standards to the authoring of science fiction, including through the first three seasons of Star Trek. In his opinion, \"...the American New Wave ushered in a great expansion of the field and of its readership... it is clear that the rise in literary and imaginative standards associated with the late 1960s contributed a great deal to some of the most original writers of the 1970s, including John Crowley, Joe Haldeman, Ursula K.

The journal embodied the SF Foundation's chief aim which was \"to promote science fiction, and bring together those who read, write, study, teach, research or archive science fiction in Britain and the rest of the world.\" Since science fiction studies was then in its infancy as an academic subject, many of its early contributors were professional writers, editors and freelance critics, especially those associated with New Wave science fiction. Its long-running features editor, from #10 (1976) to #51 (1991), was Ian Watson (author) whilst its reviews editors have included John Clute (#20-47), Colin Greenland (#47-65) and Andy Sawyer (#65-129). This element, more rooted in the fan community than in academia, and allied to the journal's long-term commitment to reviewing fiction as well as non-fiction, can be seen as \"partaking of 'certain traditions of fan scholarship'.\" With the appointment, however, of Edward James as editor in 1986, \"a more academic tone\" was introduced to the journal, which has endured under the current editorial team.

Ildefonsus' most important work was his De perpetua virginitate Mariae contra tres infideles, which imitated an earlier work by Jerome, and became the center of Spanish Marian theology.M. C. D\u00edaz y D\u00edaz, \"Literary Aspects of the Visigothic Liturgy,\" translated by Robert Richman, Salvador Starling, Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, and Edward James, in James, p. 67. The three heretics reflected the Marian teaching of Eligius, with whom Ildefonsus disagreed theologically. Ildefonsus utilises Isidore's \"synonymous method\" (or Synonyma Ciceronis) for theological purposes, wherein he repeats every phrase several times in different, although purportedly identical, ways.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 163. The identifications reveal the arguments in a rhetorically strong way, and lexicographers study the synonyms Ildefonsus used. Ildefonsus also probably wrote the Visigothic Mass of Ascension, which explains how the benefits received from Christ are richer than the wonders he performed, such as \"ascending unaided to the clouds\".M. C. D\u00edaz y D\u00edaz, \"Literary Aspects of the Visigothic Liturgy,\" translated by Robert Richman, Salvador Starling, Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, and Edward James, in James, p. 69. Theologically, Ildefonsus regarded the Nicene Creed as sufficientem scientiam salutarem (sufficient knowledge for salvation) and as a foedus (compact) between believer and God.Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\" in James, p. 26. Like Isidore of Seville before him, Ildefonsus regarded the creed as forming \"two pacts\" between God and believer: one renouncing the devil, and another the statement of belief itself.Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\" in James, p. 27. Ildefonsus encouraged frequent Communion, implying that normal practice was infrequent, and insisted upon preparation, which may have discouraged many.Jocelyn N.
