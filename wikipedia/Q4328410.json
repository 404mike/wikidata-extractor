Sasha and Digweed honed their DJing skills, often performing in tandem and focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. Renaissance was pleased with their performances, and had the duo compile the triple-CD mix album Renaissance: The Mix Collection, releasing it on the club's own Renaissance Records label. The album featured tracks from such artists as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice, and original productions and remixes from Sasha and Digweed. The Mix Collection was released soon after Sasha's departure from Renaissance in April 1994. Following his success at Renaissance, Sasha was again featured on Mixmag with the tagline \"SON OF GOD?\", though he resented the accolade. After touring together for two years, the duo became \"true superstars\" with the release of their double CD Northern Exposure on mega-label Ministry of Sound. Around this time, Sasha began a recurring mentorship and partnership with fellow producer BT with the album Ima. As well as providing guidance for BT, Sasha produced a \"euphoric\" and \"introspective\" 42-minute rendition of the album which formed the centrepiece of the UK release and appeared as a \"bonus\" second disc on the US release. He continued to advance his own production work by pairing with vocalist Maria Nayler to produce the single \"Be as One\", which reached #17 on the UK singles chart."]}, {"page": "Dreamland (Robert Miles album)", "response": ["Dreamland is the debut studio album by Robert Miles.

The song was performed by Edyta G\u00f3rniak. It was covered by Robert Miles (feat. Maria Nayler) in 1996.", "\"One and One\" was covered by Italian electronic dance musician Robert Miles and released on 4 November 1996 from his debut album, Dreamland (1996). His second hit, it features English singer Maria Nayler on vocals. \"One and One\" was Miles' second number one on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, and it also went to number one in Flanders, Israel, Italy, Romania, and Scotland.", "AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis described the song as a \"magical\" and \"gorgeous, touching, dreamy song, featuring tender vocals by Maria Nayler, which remains one of the most sincere dance songs of its era.\" Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that Nayler \"brings an appropriately ethereal quality to the cut's warm and pillowy instrumentation. She coos and whispers atop a stream of piano lines that are similar to the infectious tinkling on \"Children\", while a quietly insinuating dance beat pushes along at a disco-like pace.\" Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report commented, \"Well, no one can argue that the words are better this time around. In all seriousness, Miles disproved the long-held belief that Top 40 programmers will not play instrumentals. They do play hits, and after overcoming some initial resistance, \"Children\" proved itself to be a smash here just as it had been around the world. This followup, which does feature a vocal, has a Euro feel, which B96-Chicago MD Erik Bradley describes as hypnotic. After two weeks of spins, he reports \"a ton of calls from women. I think this will be one of the big records for fall.\" A reviewer from Music Week rated it four out of five, complimenting Nayler's \"sweet Madonna-ish vocals [that] combine with a dreamy soundscape from Miles. It's enigmatic \u2014 and another big hit.\""]}, {"page": "Cicada (band)", "response": ["| Odessi feat.
