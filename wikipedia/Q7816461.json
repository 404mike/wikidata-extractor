He became an ordained priest in his later life.\nTom Killick was a right-handed batsman who generally either opened the innings or went in at the fall of the first wicket. Educated at St Paul's School, he played a few matches for Middlesex as a 19-year-old in 1926. He then went up to Jesus College, Cambridge, but was unimpressive in the freshmen's trial match in 1927. However, he was picked for Middlesex against the University team and scored 94 and an unbeaten 42: he was then chosen for the next few university matches but, apart from an 80 that drew comment from Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for slow scoring, did little and failed to win a Blue. He played regularly for Middlesex in the second half of the season.\nThe following season, 1928, he failed again in two early games for Cambridge and again turned to Middlesex, scoring 82 in his second match for the county. Given a further trial at Cambridge, he scored 100 against Surrey and 161 against Sussex, finishing top of the university averages and winning a Blue. In the 1928 season as a whole, he scored 1231 runs, at an average of 38.\nIn 1929, Killick had his most successful season and his only taste of Test cricket. England's selectors experimented with young players in the first two matches of the 1929 series against South Africa, and Killick was picked to partner Herbert Sutcliffe as an opener. In the first match, at Edgbaston, he scored 31 and 23 in a game that ended as a rather more even draw than England had expected. At Lord's, he scored just 3 and 24 as the match was again drawn and he was dropped as England ended the experiment with youth and brought back Frank Woolley and Ted Bowley, a move that helped bring success in two of the remaining three Tests.\nKillick scored 1384 runs at an average of 44 runs per innings in 1929, but played only one first-class match \u2013 Gentlemen v Players at Lord's \u2013 after the end of the Cambridge season. The next year, 1930, he again played through the Cambridge season, making 903 runs at an average of 47, but then did not appear again.\nAcross the 1930s, as he first studied for the Anglican priesthood and then worked for the Church, he played infrequent first-class cricket, not appearing at all between 1934 and 1938. He reappeared in one match for Free Foresters in 1946, but that was his last first-class game.\nAs an ordained Anglican priest, he was a chaplain at Harrow School and later a vicar near Letchworth. He served in West Africa as an army chaplain in the Second World War and then became vicar of Bishop's Stortford. He died from a heart attack, while playing in an inter-diocesan cricket match between clergy from the St Albans and Coventry dioceses, aged 46.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Sheppard", "response": ["David Stuart Sheppard, Baron Sheppard of Liverpool (6 March 1929 \u2013 5 March 2005) was a Church of England Bishop of Liverpool who played cricket for Sussex and England in his youth.

The first was 113 for Yorkshire in a drawn match at Bramall Lane.  He then scored four in the Test series, including two in the same match in the Fifth Test at The Oval.  In the First Test at Edgbaston, Sutcliffe opened the innings with debutant Tom Killick, sharing stands of 59 and 34 in a drawn match.  Sutcliffe scored 26 and 114.  In the second innings, he and Hammond (138 not out) added 221 for the 2nd wicket.  The Second Test at Lord's was also drawn.  Sutcliffe scored 100 in the first innings after Killick had been dismissed cheaply but only 10 in the second.  England were in a strong position at the end with South Africa struggling on 90\u20135, chasing a target of 293.  England won the Third Test at Headingley by 5 wickets.  Sutcliffe opened with Ted Bowley and scored 37 and 4.  England won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by an innings and 32 runs but Sutcliffe and Bowley were both out cheaply and a 3rd wicket partnership of 245 by Bob Wyatt and Frank Woolley enabled England to recover from 36\u20132 to 281\u20133."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Tom Killick (1928\u20131929)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Tom Killick (1934) : E.
