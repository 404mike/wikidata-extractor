Sweetman writes, \"Gauguin's statue Oviri, which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take.

Like Laurie Odell, the protagonist of The Charioteer, she was suspicious of identifying oneself primarily by one's sexual orientation. Late in her life she expressed hostility to the gay rights movement, troubling some of her fans. David Sweetman remarks in his biography of Renault that her novels generally portray mothers in a poor light and that, particularly in her later novels, this is extended to women in general.  Her generally negative depiction of women has also been noted by the critic Carolyn Heilbrun.Reinventing Womanhood Carolyn Heilbrun, 1979 (Chapter Three)"]}, {"page": "The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry", "response": ["Poets included in the book were Anne Stevenson, Carol Rumens, Christopher Reid, Craig Raine, David Sweetman, Derek Mahon, Douglas Dunn, Fleur Adcock, Hugo Williams, James Fenton, Jeffrey Wainwright, Medbh McGuckian, Michael Longley, Paul Muldoon, Penelope Shuttle, Peter Scupham, Seamus Heaney, Tom Paulin, and Tony Harrison."]}, {"page": "British Poetry since 1945", "response": ["David Constantine - Douglas Dunn - James Fenton - Tony Harrison - Michael Longley - Medbh McGuckian - Andrew Motion -  Paul Muldoon - Tom Paulin - Craig Raine - Peter Scupham - C.
