When Kian's girlfriend, Bea Kaminski (Rosalind Halstead), is readmitted onto Darwin for surgery, she begs Kian for an alternative surgery, so he asks the \"increasingly-irrational\" Jac, who refuses. In surgery, Kian risks his career and sabotages the operation so that Bea can have the surgery she wants. Once the operation is complete, Jac is \"incandescent with rage\" and confronts Kian, which is witnessed by new CEO Max McGerry (Jo Martin), who reprimands them both. Having witnessed Jac's successful operation on Bea, Elliot decides to ask Jac to perform his surgery, despite protests from Fletch, who does not believe she is well enough. Aware that she is struggling, Jac decides to confide in Fletch, but they are interrupted by his girlfriend, Ange Godard (Dawn Steele); Jac then decides not to speak to Fletch. Marcel explained that Jac feels uncomfortable sharing her feelings because she has grown up independently and learnt not to trust or rely on other people."]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2005", "response": ["| Mrs Henderson Presents || The Weinstein Company || Stephen Frears (director); Martin Sherman (screenplay); Judi Dench, Bob Hoskins, Kelly Reilly, Will Young, Christopher Guest, Toby Jones, Thelma Barlow, Anna Brewster, Rosalind Halstead, Sarah Solemani, Natalia Tena, Thomas Allen, Richard Syms, Samuel Barnett || Biography ||"]}, {"page": "Nearly Famous", "response": ["*Rosalind Halstead as Kelly Short"]}, {"page": "List of British actors", "response": ["* Rosalind Halstead (born 1984)"]}, {"page": "Wuthering Heights (2009 TV serial)", "response": ["*Rosalind Halstead as Isabella Linton \u2013 Isabella is Edgar's naive sister who becomes close friends with Catherine when the latter is injured at Thrushcross Grange and stays with the Lintons.
