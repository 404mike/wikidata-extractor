A throat condition ended her concert appearances, and she turned to teaching and published about thirty songs between the years 1907 and 1925 in a romantic parlour style, as well as instrumental music in other styles. Her notable students included Roland Hayes, Lawrence Benjamin Brown, Marian Anderson and Paul Robeson. In 1930, when Robeson played Othello in the West End, Aldridge was in attendance, and gave Robeson the gold earrings that her father Ira Aldridge had worn as Othello.  Aldridge also took the singer Ida Shepley under her wing and converted her from a singer to a stage actor."]}, {"page": "Joan Kemp-Welch", "response": ["* All God's Chillun Got Wings, 1958 film featuring Lloyd Reckord, Connie Smith and Ida Shepley."]}]}}
