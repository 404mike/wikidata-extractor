Steele began his career in the early 1970s as a youngster with Rangers, although he failed to make a first-team appearance. In 1975, Steele moved to Dundee United, making ten league appearances over a year and a half in the newly formed Premier Division. After refusing to move to Dundee, as was required by then-manager Jim McLean, Steele dropped down a division to join Dumbarton. Playing in twice as many matches for the Sons, Steele moved on again at the end of the season, dropping down to the Second Division with Cowdenbeath. Steele spent five years back in his native Fife before a final two-year playing spell with Arbroath.\nAfter leaving football, Steele moved into the bookmaker business, working in Edinburgh before opening BS Bookmakers in Inverkeithing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Toronto Lynx", "response": ["*  Billy Steele \u2013 men's senior coach"]}, {"page": "Zipper Catches Skin", "response": ["*Billy Steele \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "William Steele", "response": ["*Billy Steele (born 1956), Scottish former footballer "]}, {"page": "William Steele (rugby union)", "response": ["William Charles Common Steele (born 18 April 1947) also known as Billy Steele,Bath, p161 is a former Scotland international rugby union player."]}, {"page": "David Shedden", "response": [":\"As with most great players, their greatness comes in part from their ability to combine with other great players of the era. David Shedden, a flier from the Glasgow's West of Scotland club, was lucky to be playing at the same time as Andy Irvine, one of the great attacking full-backs of all time. A classic speed merchant, Sheddden profited from Irvine's ability to slice through opposing defences, and would regular pop up on the full-back's shoulder to take a final scoring pass. Shedden, who was limited to only 15 caps because his career overlapped with another of Scotland's great wingers Billy Steele, was also defensively astute and went on providing cover when Irvine went on his charging runs upfield... It was not until Tony Stanger won his first cap eleven years later that Scotland had another out-and-out flier to rely on.\""]}]}}
