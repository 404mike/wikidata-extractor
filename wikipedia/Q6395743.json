Armstrong was among the fifteen, at left wing-forward. Four years later, his reputation as a footballer was further cemented when he was the recipient of the GAA All-Time All-Star award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Sunday Game", "response": ["Football: Kevin Armstrong, Joe Brolly, Martin Carney, Enda Colleran, Paul Curran, Tony Davis, Se\u00e1n Flanagan, Coman Goggins, Kevin Heffernan, Joe Lennon, Tommy Lyons, Jim McDonnell, Kevin McStay, Mick O'Connell, Mick O'Dwyer, Se\u00e1n O'Neill, Anthony Tohill, Dave Weldrick, Eamon Young, Colm O'Rourke."]}, {"page": "Jim Langton", "response": ["Kilkenny surrendered their provincial crown to Dublin in 1942, however, both sides faced each other in the provincial decider again in 1943.
