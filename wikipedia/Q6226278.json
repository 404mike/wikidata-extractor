He was Nottinghamshire's only professional captain before the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished in 1962. \nClay scored 9,991 runs in 236 matches at 26.08 for Nottinghamshire. His highest score came in 1952 when he made 192 against Hampshire at Trent Bridge. He was also an excellent slip fielder, holding a record of six catches in a match against Derbyshire.\nAfter his first-class cricket career, he captained and mentored Nottinghamshire's second team. Writing in Wisden Cricketers magazine in 2011, Peter Wynne-Thomas, NCCC's archivist, said: 'This was an ideal role for an ideal cricketer who always saw the best in his fellow players.'\nClay followed NCCC all his life. He played for Notts Public Schools while a pupil at the West Bridgford School in the 1930s. This took him during tournaments to nearby Trent Bridge, Nottingham's Test arena. He continued to be a regular visitor to international and county cricket matches at Trent Bridge after his career there, where he was instrumental in setting up the supporters' club. \nClay served in the RAF in London during the Second World War. After he retired from cricket he was manager at Middleton's newsagents in West Bridgford before working at Boots until his retirement. \nOne of 14 children, John lived throughout his life within half a mile of Trent Bridge. He and his wife Sheila were married for over 60 years and had 2 children, 6 grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Clay", "response": ["John Clay may refer to:", "*Sir John Clay, combatant in the Wars of the Roses", "*John Clay (chaplain) (1796\u20131858), English prison chaplain", "*John Clay (cricketer, born 1924) (1924\u20132011), English cricketer", "*John Clay (offensive tackle) (born 1964), American football player", "*John Clay (running back) (born 1988), American football player", "*The Red-Headed League, an 1891 short story by Arthur Conan Doyle with a character named John Clay"]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*11 February \u2013 John Clay, cricketer (b. 1924)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2011", "response": ["*John Clay, 86, English cricketer."]}, {"page": "John Clay (cricketer b. 1924)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Clay (cricketer, born 1924)"]}, {"page": "John Desmond Clay", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Clay (cricketer, born 1924)"]}]}}
