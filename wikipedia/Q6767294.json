He studied at Diocesan College in Cape Town, and played cricket for Western Province junior teams between the ages of 13 and 18. Kieswetter was disappointed when he was asked to play club cricket for two or three seasons before returning to play for the senior team; he never received an explanation and decided instead to pursue a cricket career in England, where he moved at the age of 18. He studied for his A-levels for a year at Millfield, where Mark Davis, a former Somerset bowler, spotted him. He was quickly signed by Somerset. At the 2006 Under-19s World Cup in Sri Lanka, he represented South Africa and won a Man of the Match award in a game against the United States for his innings of 80 off 66 balls."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Mark Davis"]}, {"page": "Mark Davis (cricketer, born 1962)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Davis (English cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Mark Richard Davis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Davis (English cricketer)"]}]}}
