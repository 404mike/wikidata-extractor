In the episode \"Cuthbert's Morning Off\", Cuthbert's name is omitted (due to his absence). They are continually being called out to attend some emergency or other (in many cases to resolve fairly trivial matters), but to Captain Flack's annoyance never an actual fire. The main reason for this was the difficulty of animating fire, water, and smoke, although a naked flame was successfully animated in episode 8, for the abortive lighting of a bonfire. Nonetheless, after \"Right men, action stations!\", the fire brigade often absent-mindedly deployed the fire hose and received a rebuke from Captain Flack (\"No, no! Not the hose!\").", "Writer Gordon Murray has said that the communities of the series are \"representative of real locations which are one-and-a-half miles from each other in an equidistant triangle\", but declined to name them for fear of the area being \"inundated with tourists\".", "In 2011, BBC Studios and Post Production digitally restored all 39 episodes of the Trumptonshire trilogy (Camberwick Green, Trumpton and Chigley) after William Mollett, son-in-law of the creator Gordon Murray, found some original footage in an attic.

The year 1950 saw the premier of the long-running children's TV series Watch with Mother (1950\u201374) which would not include animation per se, but would feature several puppet-based segments (such as \"Andy Pandy\" and \"Flower Pot Men\") that would later become staples of British children's popular imagery and animation. Such is the case as well with the children's book character Noddy, who has appeared in various iterations and with different means of animation ranging from stop-motion to CGI to this day. The BBC's investment in resources and personnel oriented to children's media during this time would also provide avenues for the service's eventual inclusion of animation\u2014particularly stop-motion animation, which could be derived from some of the same resources and skill-sets as live action puppetry. Puppeteer Gordon Murray for example, would  branch off from his work on the \"Watch with Mother\" segment \"The Woodentops\" and other live action puppet shows to create several stop motion animated children's series in the 1960s, including \"Camberwick Green\" (1966), \"Trumpton\" (1967) and \"Chigley\" (1969). Modelmaker Peter Firmin and writer Oliver Postgate similarly created several stop-motion animated works for children during this period, including \"Pingwings\" (1961\u20131964), \"Pogles' Wood\" (1966\u20131967) and \"Clangers\" (1969\u20131972).Sibley, Brian (1998). \"The Medium\". In Lord, Peter; Sibley, Brian. Cracking Animation (1st ed.). Thames and Hudson. p. 38 It is during this period that ties between the UK's children's animation and several other British media and literary tendencies consolidated, with shows of this period providing a blueprint for future children's TV focussing on rural communities and day-to-day interpersonal relationships. Within this tendency, strong ties can be seen within children's TV and much older pastoral children's literature, social realist cinema and documentary, and the theatrical comedy of manners. This transition from puppetry to stop-motion also demonstrates the influence of Eastern European animation (such as that of Czech animator Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka and his followers), with its own proclivity for wood and felt animation puppets and often static facial features. Trnka's work helped to inspire British production companies, including Pete Bryden and Ed Cookson's BBC-commissioned stop-frame animated children's series Summerton Mill (2005)."]}, {"page": "A Rubovian Legend", "response": ["A Rubovian Legend  (1955) is a British children's television series created by Gordon Murray."]}, {"page": "Freddie Phillips", "response": ["Mainly a classical guitarist, Phillips worked and performed in the fields of opera and ballet, including with The Royal Ballet, and with the BBC Symphony Orchestra.
