Glover", "response": ["Glover was born in Macon County, North Carolina, the son of Richard Leonidas Glover and Caroline Piercy Glover. His paternal grandparents were English-born socialite and poet Jane Cocking Glover and , a prominent Maryland attorney. He moved to Washington at age eight to live there with his grandmother. He started working as a teller at Riggs & Company in 1866. In the wake of the Panic of 1873, after many banks had failed, Glover was promoted to Chief Administrative Officer at age 27. He became partner and was the bank's effective leader in 1881 at the time of the death of George Washington Riggs. In 1896, the bank was converted into a national bank and he became its President. In the early 1900s he oversaw the construction of the new Riggs National Bank headquarters facing the US Treasury Building. He retired from the bank in 1921."]}, {"page": "Pietro Bonanni", "response": ["Andrew Consentino has said of Bonanni that he was \"the finest painter of the community at the time\", and suggests that he \"might have engendered a local tradition had he not died so prematurely\". Comparatively little is known of his career in Washington, but in 1818 he raffled off a painting of James Monroe. A portrait of Jane Cocking Glover, painted in the year of his death, was formerly owned by the Corcoran Gallery of Art; at that institution's dissolution it passed into the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. The James Monroe Museum in Fredericksburg, Virginia, owns a painting of Monroe's Return to Washington, 1817, of uncertain date. An 1820 portrait of Mary Sumner Blount currently hangs in Mordecai House in Raleigh, North Carolina. An 1818 portrait of Carlo Franzoni is held in the collection of the United States Capitol; a self-portrait formerly in the same collection was destroyed in a fire in the Capitol's art restoration room in 1930."]}]}}
