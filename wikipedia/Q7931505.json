Griffiths played club rugby for Newport and captained the team in the 1928/29 season.\nGriffiths gained his first cap for Wales in 1924 against Scotland at Inverleith. Wales were humiliated by Scotland, but Griffiths scored a try and regained his position to be chosen to face Ireland in the next match of the Five Nations Championship. Griffiths's last game for Wales was against Ireland, but was chosen to join the British Lions 1924 tour of South Africa; he played in six games, including two tests.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newport RFC", "response": ["*  Vince Griffiths 1924"]}, {"page": "1967 in Wales", "response": ["**Vince Griffiths, rugby player, 65"]}, {"page": "1924 British Lions tour to South Africa", "response": ["*Vince Griffiths (Newport)"]}, {"page": "Mel Rosser", "response": ["Although Rosser was dropped after the Scotland game, missing the encounter with Ireland, he was reselected for the final game of the Championship, away to France. Rosser was originally intended to play at centre, but on the train trip to Paris the Welsh selectors suspended Ossie Male as he had broken a rule preventing any player from representing Wales if they had played club rugby within the week leading up to the international match.Smith (1980), pg 214. With no other fullback aboard the train, Rosser was switched to an emergency fullback with reserve player Joe Jones drafted into the backs. It was a narrow win for Wales, with the victory coming thanks to a Vince Griffiths dropped goal."]}]}}
