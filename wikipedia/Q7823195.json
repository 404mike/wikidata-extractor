According to Ruairidh MacLeod, Lord Loudoun himself decided to abandon his position and divide his troops: The Mackay and Sutherland men (Independent Highland Companies) were to go north to Lord Reay's country, and this somewhat agrees with Tony Pollard's  account that others of Loudoun's regiment escaped to the lands of the Mackays in the far north of Sutherland. MacLeod goes on to say that Lord Loudoun with his own regiment and the rest of the companies would go westwards. The rebels did not press their attack and on 21 March they rendezvoused west of Dornoch. On 22 March, the rebels marched off in pursuit of Lord Loudoun but found no one."]}, {"page": "Two Men in a Trench", "response": ["Two Men in a Trench follows archaeologists Tony Pollard and Neil Oliver around the British Isles, where they visit ancient battlegrounds and use modern archaeological methods, bringing information about the battles and those who participated in them to their viewers. Pollard and Oliver take differing roles in their visits to each battleground, with Pollard taking a more hands on approach by visiting the sites and participating in more traditional archaeological methods, with excavation and hand-digging in the trenches among the most common. Oliver takes his expertise to others, performing research and interviewing experts on the battles themselves, as well as narrating the movement of the armies and detailing the mindset of the commanders taking part. It isn't a particularly grim rendition of the past either; oftentimes the two will have a pleasant rapport at the end of the episodes, and continually have comedic aspects slotted in, in order to keep the general tone of the episodes light-hearted."]}, {"page": "Tony Pollard", "response": ["Tony Pollard may refer to:", "*Tony Pollard (archaeologist) (born 1965), British archaeologist", "*Tony Pollard (American football) (born 1997), American football running back"]}, {"page": "Waterloo Soldier", "response": ["The remains were put on show on 23 May 2015 at the Memorial of Waterloo 1815 in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant.
