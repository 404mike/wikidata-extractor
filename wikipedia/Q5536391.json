He was born at Wimbledon, then in Surrey (now London), and died at Ore, Hastings, Sussex.\nEducated at Tonbridge School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Scott was a right-arm fast bowler and a right-handed tail-end batsman. He played first for Cambridge University in 1900 and in his second match, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), he took five first innings wickets for 72 runs, his wickets being five of the first six MCC batsmen. However, he achieved little in two subsequent games for the university side and did not win a blue. After the university term was over, he appeared in a second eleven match for Kent.In 1901, Scott was picked for the \"seniors'\" trial match at Cambridge, and did well, with seven wickets in the match. That led to his recall for one further first-class match with the university first eleven, but he was not successful, failing to take a wicket in the game. When the university term was over in 1901, he played Minor Counties cricket for Norfolk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Scott", "response": ["*George Arbuthnot Scott (1879\u20131927), cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Old Tonbridgians", "response": ["* George Arbuthnot Scott, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Avison Scott", "response": ["Scott was a descendant of the commentator Thomas Scott; great nephew of Sir George Gilbert Scott; nephew of George Gilbert Scott Jr.; uncle of Elliot Dowell Tillard; cousin of Giles Gilbert Scott; and father of George Arbuthnot Scott."]}, {"page": "Elliot Tillard", "response": ["Several of Tillard's family played first-class cricket.
