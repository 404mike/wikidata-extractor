Walter Fox was a machine enameller by trade and a veteran of the First World War. Alan Fox failed his eleven plus examination and \u2014 like most British working class children of his generation \u2014 left school at the age of 14. He worked first as a laboratory assistant at a grammar school and then in a photographic film factory.\nWhen the Second World War broke out, Fox joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and applied for aircrew training, but was rejected due to poor eyesight. He served initially as a ground staff photographer in India and Burma, with the rank of Corporal. He volunteered for service as an aerial photographer with No. 3 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, which undertook hazardous missions over Japanese-held areas, using North American Mitchell aircraft. Fox, who was promoted to Sergeant, received the Distinguished Flying Medal (RAF). After the war, Fox worked for the Forestry Commission in Scotland.\nIn 1947\u201348, he undertook a diploma in public administration at Ruskin College, an independent institution in Oxford. Fox then entered the University of Oxford, where he spent the majority of his academic career, studying economics and political science at Exeter College. In 1950, while lecturing at Ruskin, he completed a Bachelor of Letters (B.Litt.) thesis on the history of industrial relations in the Black Country. That same year, Fox married Margaret Dow, with whom he had two sons. In 1958, he became a research fellow at Nuffield College and in 1963, he became a lecturer at Nuffield, in the Department of Social and Administrative Studies.\nFox rose to prominence with a 1966 paper, Industrial Sociology And Industrial Relations, written for the Donovan Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations (1965\u201368). In it he described the dominance in industrial relations of two, rival ideological/theoretical perspectives. The first, for which Fox coined the name \"unitary\" (later unitarist), denies that the interests of employers and employees were significantly different from each other. For the other perspective, he used an existing term from political science: \"pluralist\", a perspective which suggests that multiple parties are involved in decision-making. However, Fox himself was strongly influenced by a third major theoretical position: the \"radical\" perspective, especially Marxism.With Allan Flanders and Hugh Clegg, Fox became prominent in a group of scholars known collectively as the \"Oxford school of industrial relations\". Although the Oxford school was frequently associated with pluralism,  during the 1970s Fox adopted an overtly radical position. In \"Industrial relations: a social critique of pluralist ideology\" (1973) and Beyond Contract (1974), he suggested that unitarism and pluralism, in practice, were often combined and/or difficult to distinguish.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Industrial relations", "response": ["In the 1950s, industrial relations was formalized as a distinct academic discipline with the emergence in the UK of the so-called \"Oxford school\", including Allan Flanders, Hugh Clegg, and Alan Fox, Lord William McCarthy, Sir George Bain (all of whom taught at Nuffield College, Oxford), as well as Otto Kahn-Freund (Brasenose College, Oxford).", "Industrial relations scholars such as Alan Fox have described three major theoretical perspectives or frameworks, that contrast in their understanding and analysis of workplace relations. The three views are generally known as unitarism, pluralism, and the radical or critical school. Each offers a particular perception of workplace relations and will, therefore, interpret such events as workplace conflict, the role of unions and job regulation differently. The perspective of the critical school is sometimes referred to as the conflict model, although this is somewhat ambiguous, as pluralism also tends to see conflict as inherent in workplaces. Radical theories are strongly identified with Marxist theories, although they are not limited to these."]}, {"page": "Alan Fox", "response": ["Alan Fox may refer to:", "* Alan Fox (sociologist) (1920\u20132002), English industrial sociologist", "* Alan Fox (footballer) (1936\u20132021), Welsh professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Trades Union Congress", "response": ["* Clegg, Hugh Armstrong, Alan Fox, and A.F.

His academic studies began with 19th-century politics, and he intended to mix Sir Lewis Namier's style of analysis with careful studies of voting behaviour and apply these approaches to the premiership of William Gladstone. His attention gradually turned towards the progressive and radical political movements of the latter part of that century and from there to the origins of the labour movement, focusing especially on the role of trade unions and industrial relations \u2013 a school of thought pioneered by him and his colleagues at Oxford, Hugh Clegg and Alan Fox.
