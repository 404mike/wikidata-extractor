A wicket-keeper, he was an integral part of the Surrey side that won the County Championship in every season from 1952 to 1958 inclusive, and played in three Tests for the English cricket team, two in 1950 and one in 1955. According to McIntyre's obituary in  The Daily Telegraph, Peter May wrote: \"Godfrey Evans could touch great heights of wicketkeeping but day in, day out, Arthur was the most reliable wicketkeeper of the 1950s... He should have kept many times for England.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Laker", "response": ["While Laker had done enough at Saltaire to be well remembered there, his cricketing career really gathered pace and took off while he was with the RAOC in Egypt. Playing on coconut matting wickets in inter-service matches, he decided to develop the off spin technique he had been taught by Benny Wilson. He recalled that, \"to my utter amazement\", he could turn the ball \"quite prodigiously\" on the matting strips. John Arlott later wrote that English cricketers in Egypt were writing home and talking about \"a Yorkshire lad who could bowl off spin like a master\". In 1943, Laker went to Alexandria to play for the RAOC against an RAF team and took five wickets for ten runs including a hat-trick. In 1944, he played against a South African Air Force XI, scored a century and then took six wickets for ten runs. In these matches, he encountered several top-class players including Norman Yardley, Peter Smith, Bert Sutcliffe, Ron Aspinall, Dudley Nourse and Arthur McIntyre.", "The 1958 season was the last of Surrey's seven consecutive County Championships but it was marred by a quarrel between Laker and the team captain Peter May, who had accused Laker of \"not trying\" in a match against Kent at Blackheath in July. Kent won the match by 29 runs. Laker bowled a total of 54 overs in the match and that immediately followed a haul of 63 overs in a match against Glamorgan at Swansea, which Surrey won. It seems that Laker's spinning finger was definitely suffering from \"wear and tear\" at the time and this probably reduced his effectiveness. His colleagues held differing views about the matter. Peter Loader said May was completely out of order while Micky Stewart suggested that May should have been aware that \"Jim was knackered\". Godfrey Evans, who played for Kent in the match, said that Laker was \"ill-supported by May\". Raman Subba Row blamed May for his \"management style\" which was not at all people-oriented, unlike that of Stuart Surridge, May's predecessor as Surrey captain, who was a \"people person\" and \"down to earth\". On the other hand, Arthur McIntyre blamed Laker for his batting in the Kent match because he \"holed out\" and made a more general comment about Laker \"crying wolf\" over injuries to his fingers.", "In Peter May's autobiography, he wrote about how Arthur McIntyre kept superbly to the great Surrey bowling attack of Bedser, Loader, Laker and Lock on difficult wickets. McIntyre himself said that, of the four, he had the greatest difficulty keeping wicket to Laker who \"spun the ball so viciously\"."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Arthur McIntyre"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Arthur McIntyre", "* Arthur McIntyre (1959-1976)"]}, {"page": "Ken Barrington", "response": ["Stuart Surridge became captain of Surrey in 1952 and led them to their first of a record seven successive County Championships.

Their bowling line up was of Test class and it was for his growing batting skills that the young Barrington was called up. He made his first-class cricket debut against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in their traditional match against the champions at Lord's at the start of the cricket season. Barrington batted at number six and was stumped by Godfrey Evans off Alan Oakman for 7 in the first innings and caught off Oakman for 17 in the second as Surrey lost a low scoring match by 107 runs.

His deputy was Arthur McIntyre, who kept wicket for Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and Tony Lock in the Surrey side that would win the County Championship seven times in a row in 1952-58. Len Hutton was a good slip and would pick up 9 catches in the series and Trevor Bailey took some great catches in the gully. Unfortunately the MCC had no other slip fielders and they were joined by Gilbert Parkhouse, who hated the role and frequently dropped catches.p25, Kay John Dewes was a good outfielder, but the rest of the team failed to impress and a picture of John Warr was used to illustrate how not to take catches.p400, Frith"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Surrey showed improvements on 1946 but Playfair remarked on \"the need for new blood\".

Ray Lindwall had been dropped for the last Test in South Africa, his form suffering from a series of ailments, but was recalled to the team to replace Geff Noblet. Batsmen Jack Moroney and Sam Loxton kept their places, but leg-spinner Colin McCool was replaced by the 35-year-old debutant mystery spinner Jack Iverson. The task for the England tour selectors was not quite so easy. The managers Brigadier Michael Green and John Nash, captain Freddie Brown, vice-captain Denis Compton and senior professional Len Hutton kept most of the team from the Fourth and final Test against the West Indies in 1950.

In the end he was unfit to play and was replaced by the Welsh amateur batsmen Gilbert Parkhouse who had made 58 in the Australian XI game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged Brian Close was brought in as the best of a bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against long hops and full tosses served up in a minor game. Brown thought that if nothing else as an all-rounder he could help take some of the strain off the other bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. Australia made only one change, dropping Jack Moroney for having made a pair in the First Test.
