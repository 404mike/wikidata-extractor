Everyone in the novel does this to some extent, wittingly or not, as they try to juggle the details of their lives, keeping all the balls in the air, holding the pattern together. The most daring and skilful juggler of all is Barbara Trapido herself, who puts her characters through dizzying permutations of gender, identity, background and relationships, both personal and genetic. The pace increases imperceptibly, creeping up on the reader, until what started as a fairly sober and straightforward study of generational conflicts ends in a pyrotechnic climax which exploits every Shakespearian device - identical twins, lost siblings, transposed parents, unlikely couples, outrageous coincidences and brazenly expedient plotting - to an extent which might have made even the Bard blush.\" and he concludes \"The result is a work of enormous charm, highly entertaining and told with a deft touch, which handles serious matters lightly and treats light ones with proper respect\".BOOK REVIEW / A better sort of tragedy: Juggling by Barbara Trapido - Hamish Hamilton pounds 9.99 - Arts & Entertainment - The Independent", "*Interview with Barbara Trapido"]}, {"page": "List of South African women writers", "response": ["* Barbara Trapido (born 1941)"]}, {"page": "Alexandra Pringle", "response": ["Pringle joined Bloomsbury in 1999, as head of the adult publishing division.
