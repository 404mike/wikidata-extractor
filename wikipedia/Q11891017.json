He refers to this as \"the metaphor of design ... Organisms give the appearance of being designed, and thanks to Charles Darwin's discovery of natural selection we know why this is true.\" In his review of Ruse's book, R.J. Richards writes, \"Biologists quite routinely refer to the design of organisms and their traits, but properly speaking it's apparent design to which they refer \u2013 an 'as if' design.\" Robert Foley refers to this as \"the illusion of purpose, design, and progress\". He adds, \"there is no purpose in a fundamentally causative manner in evolution but that the processes of selection and adaptation give the illusion of purpose through the utter functionality and designed nature of the biological world\".Foley, RA., in Morris, SC., The Deep Structure of Biology: Is Convergence Sufficiently Ubiquitous to Give a Directional Signal, Templeton Foundation Press, 2008 p. 175."]}, {"page": "Sociocultural evolution", "response": ["*** On stony ground: Lithic technology, human evolution, and the emergence of culture (p 109\u2013122) Robert Foley, Marta Miraz\u00f3n Lahr"]}, {"page": "Robert Foley", "response": ["Robert Foley may refer to:", "*Robert Foley (academic) (born 1953), British anthropologist and archaeologist", "*Robert Foley (American politician) (born 1953), politician from Maine", "*Robert Foley (footballer) (born 1946), Ghanaian footballer", "*Robert Foley (ironmonger) (1624\u20131676), English ironmonger and High Sheriff", "*Robert Foley (priest) (died 1783), Dean of Worcester Cathedral", "*Robert Foley (MP) (1651\u20131702), English politician"]}, {"page": "Foley (surname)", "response": ["* Robert Foley (disambiguation), several people including:", ":* Robert Foley (academic) (born 1953), British anthropologist and archaeologist", ":* Robert Foley (American politician) (born 1953), politician from Maine", ":* Robert Foley (footballer) (born 1946), Ghanaian footballer", ":* Robert Foley (ironmonger) (1624\u20131676), English ironmonger and High Sheriff", ":* Robert Foley (priest) (died 1783), Dean of Worcester Cathedral", ":* Robert Foley (MP) (1651\u20131702), English politician"]}, {"page": "Robert A.
