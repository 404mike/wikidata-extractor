Reddaway moved to the United States in the 1980s and served as Director of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies (1986-89). From 1989 until his retirement in 2004, he was Professor of Political Science at the George Washington University, teaching courses on Soviet and post-Soviet affairs, and on human rights, and a multi-disciplinary introduction to Russia and Eastern Europe. He is currently Emeritus Professor at this university.Starting from the early 1970s, Reddaway was closely involved with the Soviet dissident and human rights movement. He published some of his articles about it in the Dissent Magazine. His major works include Uncensored Russia: The Human Rights Movement in the USSR (1972), which consists primarily of his translation of the first 11 issues of the underground Chronicle of Current Events; Psychiatric Terror: How Soviet Psychiatry is Used to Suppress Dissent (co-authored with Sidney Bloch, 1977); Soviet Psychiatric Abuse (co-authored with Sidney Bloch, 1984); Authority, Power and Policy in the USSR (co-edited with T.H. Rigby and Archie Brown, 1980); The Tragedy of Russia's Reforms: Market Bolshevism Against Democracy (co-authored with Dmitri Glinski, 2001); The Dynamics of Russian Politics: Putin's Reform of Federal-Regional Relations (in 2 volumes, co-authored with Robert Orttung, 2003-2004), and The Dissidents: A Memoir (2020). Reddaway is the author of many articles and provided numerous testimonies on Russia to congressional hearings, including on corruption in Russia at the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. According to one of Reddaway's presentations, \"by 1998, Yeltsin's regime and the Russian state had become not just dangerously weak and corrupt, but also... financially dependent on Russia's wealthy elite\"; he viewed Vladimir Putin as a product of the Yeltsin system, who, \"if he does try to change the system... will find himself a prisoner of the system.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "American Committee for Peace in Chechnya", "response": ["| Arch Puddington||Peter Reddaway||Peter R.

In the Soviet Union, psychiatric hospitals were often used by the authorities as prisons, in order to isolate political prisoners from the rest of society, discredit their ideas, and break them physically and mentally.  As such, psikhushkas were considered a form of torture.See: Sidney Bloch and Peter Reddaway (1984). Soviet Psychiatric Abuse: The Shadow over World Psychiatry.

They wrote that if this was the case the group would likely originate from the religious conservative villages Karamakhi, Chabanmakhi and a few other neighbouring villages in central Dagestan. They also wrote that if so, they believe \"it is impossible that the Moscow authorities did not know of the plans, at least in general terms\", noting that \"even before Stepashin visited the district a year earlier, they must have been receiving numerous reports from, in particular, the FSB, the Interior Ministry and probably eavesdropping agency FAPSI.\" A journalist who in mid-August 1999 traveled to Karamakhi and interviewed some villagers and their military commander General Dzherollak, wrote: \"The Wahhabis' trucks go all over Russia. Even one wrong move in Moscow or Makhachkala, they warn, will lead to bombs and bloodshed everywhere.\" According to the journalist the Wahhabis had told him, \"if they start bombing us, we know where our bombs will explode.\" In the last days of August, Russian military launched an aerial bombing of the villages."]}, {"page": "Alexander Herzen Foundation", "response": ["The Alexander Herzen Foundation was legally established May 19, 1969, in Amsterdam. The Dutch slavist and essayist Karel van het Reve (1921\u20131999) took the initiative and was one of the trustees. The other trustees were the Dutch historian Jan Willem Bezemer (1921\u20132000) and the British-American politicologist Peter Reddaway (1939).See: Website Karel van het Reve (in Dutch).. Frank Fisher and his wife Elisabeth Fisher-Spanjer were also involved in its founding.

In France, a group of doctors constituted the \"Committee against the Special Psychiatric Hospitals in the USSR,\" while in Great Britain a \"Working Commission on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals\" was created. Among its founding members were Peter Reddaway, a Sovietologist and lecturer at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Sidney Bloch, a South-African born psychiatrist. In September 1975, there was formed the Campaign Against Psychiatric Abuse (CAPA), an organization constituted as the British section of the Initiating Committee Against Abuses of Psychiatry for Political Purposes and composed of psychiatrists, other doctors, and laymen. In July 1976 in Trafalgar Square, CAPA held a rally against the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR. In 1978, Royal College of Psychiatrists established the Special Committee on abuse of psychiatry. 20 December 1980 saw the formation in Paris of the International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry (IAPUP) whose first secretary was G\u00e9rard Bles of France. Since the Congress in Honolulu in 1978, he has inspired the movement against the use of psychiatry for political ends.", "The commission gathered as much information as possible of victims of psychiatric terror in the Soviet Union and published this information in their Information Bulletins. For the four years of its existence, the Commission published more than 1,500 pages of documentation including 22 Information Bulletins in which over 400 cases of the political abuse of psychiatry were documented in great detail. Summaries of the Information Bulletins were published in the key samizdat publication, A Chronicle of Current Events. The Information Bulletins were sent to the Soviet officials, with request to verify the data and notify the Commission if mistakes were found, and to the West, where human rights defenders used them in the course of their campaigns. The Information Bulletins were also used to provide the dissident movement with information about Western protests against the political abuse. Peter Reddaway said that after he had studied official documents in the Soviet archives, including minutes from meetings of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it became evident to him that Soviet officials at high levels paid close attention to foreign responses to these cases, and if someone was discharged, all dissidents felt the pressure had played a significant part and the more foreign pressure the better. Over fifty victims examined by psychiatrists of the Moscow Working Commission between 1977 and 1981 and the files smuggled to the West by Vladimir Bukovsky in 1971 were the material that convinced most psychiatric associations that there was distinctly something wrong in the USSR.", "In 1989, the stonewalling of Soviet psychiatry was overcome by perestroika and glasnost (meaning \"policy of transparency\" in Russian).;  Over the objection of the psychiatric establishment, the Soviet government permitted a delegation of psychiatrists from the US, representing the United States government, to carry out extensive interviews of suspected victims of abuse. They traveled to the Soviet Union on 25 February 1989. The group consisted of about 25 people among whom were William Farrand of the State Department; Loren H. Roth as head of the psychiatric team; psychiatrists of the National Institute of Mental Health, including Scientific Director of the US Delegation Darrel A. Regier, Harold Visotsky from Chicago as head of the hospital visit team, and four \u00e9migr\u00e9 Soviet psychiatrists living in the United States. There also were State Department interpreters, two attorneys, Ellen Mercer of the American Psychiatric Association and Peter Reddaway.", "When returned home after a visit of more than two weeks, the delegation wrote its report which was pretty damaging to the Soviet authorities. The delegation established not only that there had taken place systematic political abuse of psychiatry but also that the abuse had not come to an end, that victims of the abuse still remained in mental hospitals, and that the Soviet authorities and particularly the Soviet Society of Psychiatrists and Neuropathologists still denied that psychiatry had been employed as a method of repression. On 17 July 1989, William Farrand, Peter Reddaway, and Darrel Regier expounded the findings of their report in the TV interview Psychiatric Practices in the Soviet Union broadcast by C-SPAN. The report was published in Schizophrenia Bulletin, Supplement to Vol. 15, No. 4, 1989.; ;  The report by the American psychiatrists, who inspected a number of Soviet psychiatric hospitals in March 1989, remained secret for all ordinary psychiatrists of the country. It reached the point of absurdity when the administration of the special hospitals visited by the American doctors sent the WPA a request to send them the report from the USA. The American part has translated the obtained Soviet reply into Russian but even the action has not made the USSR Health Ministry declassify the documents. As far as Robert van Voren could establish, the report was never published in the USSR. Only after twenty years, in 2009, the report was translated into Russian, and its Russian version was published not in Russia but in the Netherlands, on the website of the Global Initiative on Psychiatry."]}, {"page": "Vladislav Krasnov", "response": ["In 1985, Vladislav Krasnov published a book which, according to Peter Reddaway, became the first scholarly study of the phenomenon of \"defection\" from the Soviet Union.Peter Reddaway's preface:   The work summarized several years of research he conducted at Hoover institution using a variety of sources. The most important source for his work was the document he nicknamed \"The KGB Wanted List\": an  internal KGB publication containing a list of some 600 defectors then at large, summarizing the information the Soviet authorities had on each person\u2018s background, circumstances of their defection, their then-current whereabouts and activities,  as well as the information about any in absentia sentences they may have received. The publication had been leaked to the \u00e9migr\u00e9 magazine Posev, an organ of the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists. The leaked KGB files were supplemented by a number of other sources, such as records of interviews with a number of defectors conducted by US officials in the 1950s, and materials gleaned from the media."]}]}}
