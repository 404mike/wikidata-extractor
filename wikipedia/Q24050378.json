There, he enjoyed a successful campaign which culminated in him winning the club's Player of the Season, Young Player of the Season and top goalscorer awards, becoming the first player ever to do so in a single season. A further loan spell at Swansea City followed for Abraham but the season ended with the club suffering relegation from the Premier League. He then joined Aston Villa in 2018 and became the first player since 1977 to score 25 goals in a single campaign for the club.\nFormerly an England youth international, Abraham represented the nation from under-18 level, and featured at the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Poland. He made his senior debut in November 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol City F.C.", "response": ["|2016\u201317|| Tammy Abraham||Striker", "|2016\u201317|| Tammy Abraham||41||3||23"]}, {"page": "1997", "response": ["* October 2 \u2013 Tammy Abraham, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Camberwell", "response": ["* Tammy Abraham, professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Ijaw people", "response": ["*Tammy Abraham , Is a Professional Footballer."]}, {"page": "FA Youth Cup", "response": ["| Tammy Abraham"]}, {"page": "Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel", "response": ["\u00c1ngel signed for Premier League side Aston Villa on 12 January 2001, becoming the club's record signing at \u00a39.5 million.
