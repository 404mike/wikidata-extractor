He was also the leader of a protest movement to topple Oxford's Cutteslowe Wall which segregated poor working class communities from wealthier ones. While living in Oxford he led tenant strikes in Cowley, and raised money for refugee children from the Spanish Civil War.Lazarus contracted rheumatic fever during his childhood and this affected his education, because of his condition he was taught at home by his mother. His health recovered in 1928 so he got a job working as a professional driver and a mechanic, later on in 1930 he joined the Hammersmith branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain and became involved in the National Unemployed Workers' Movement. While in London he was often seen selling the Daily Worker outside Belsize Park tube station. In 1933 he led a strike at the Firestone tyre factory and this earned him the nickname 'Bill Firestone'. After the strike he became the South Midlands organiser for the Communist Party.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carl Marzani", "response": ["In 1937 Marzani returned to Oxford and married Edith Eisner (stage name Edith Emerson).

Lazarus, who often went by the pseudonym \"Bill Firestone\", was already well known in the city of Oxford for having organised a rent strike on the Florence Park housing estate in Cowley, and chairing the 1934 Oxford Pressed Steel Company strike committee. On 11 May 1935, the Oxford branch of the CPGB and Lazarus gathered a crowd of over 2,000 people to call for the demolition of the Cuttleslowe Walls, and approached the wall wielding pickaxes. However, Oxford City Police intercepted the march and defended the walls."]}, {"page": "Lazarus (name)", "response": ["* Abraham Lazarus (1911\u20131967), British politician"]}, {"page": "Communist Party of Great Britain", "response": ["The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was the largest communist party in Great Britain between 1920 and 1991. Founded in 1920 through a merger of several smaller Marxist parties, the CPGB gained the support of many socialist organisations and trade unions following the political fallout of the First World War and the Russian October Revolution. Ideologically the CPGB was a socialist party organised upon Marxism\u2013Leninist ideology, strongly opposed to British colonialism, sexual discrimination, and racial segregation. These beliefs led many leading anti-colonial revolutionaries, feminists, and anti-fascist figures, to become closely associated with the party. Many prominent CPGB members became leaders of Britain's trade union movements, including Jessie Eden, Abraham Lazarus, Ken Gill, Clem Beckett, GCT Giles, Mike Hicks, and Thora Silverthorne."]}, {"page": "Anthony Carritt", "response": ["The Carritt family became famous for being a hub for socialist revolutionaries and communists, such as Abraham Lazarus, labour politicians including Dick crossman, and poets such as WH Auden. The family was also friends with another family of left-wing activists called the Thompsons, which lived very close to the Carritt family and their children often attended Dragon School together. One of these children who Anthony knew became the historian E. P. Thompson. Anthony Carritt was considered the least political of his brothers, and it is unknown as to whether he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) like his mother and his brothers."]}, {"page": "Abe Lazarus", "response": ["#REDIRECT Abraham Lazarus"]}]}}
