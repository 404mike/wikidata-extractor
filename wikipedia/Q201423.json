From 1972 to 1978, he was the drummer for Soft Machine, replacing Phil Howard when he joined.\nMarshall was born in Isleworth, Middlesex, and has worked with various jazz and rock bands and musicians, among them J.

He is currently touring as a member of the band (November 2018), which operates under the name Soft Machine again since 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Soft Machine", "response": ["Soft Machine are  an English rock band from Canterbury formed in mid-1966 by Robert Wyatt (drums, vocals, 1966\u20131971), Kevin Ayers (bass, guitar, vocals, 1966\u20131968), Daevid Allen (guitar, 1966\u20131967), and Mike Ratledge (organ, 1966\u20131976). As a central band of the Canterbury scene, the group became one of the first British psychedelic acts and later moved into progressive rock and jazz fusion. Their varying line-ups have included former members such as Hugh Hopper (bass, 1969\u20131973), Elton Dean (saxophone, 1969\u20131972), and Andy Summers (guitar, 1968), and currently consists of John Marshall (drums), Roy Babbington (bass), John Etheridge (guitar), and Theo Travis (saxophone, flutes, keyboards)", "After differences over the group's musical direction, Wyatt left (or was fired from)Unterberger, Richie: 1996 Robert Wyatt interview  at Perfect Sound Forever  (online music magazine) the band in August 1971 and formed Matching Mole (a pun on machine molle, French for soft machine; also said at the time to have been taken from stage lighting equipment \"Matching Mole\"). He was briefly replaced by Australian drummer Phil Howard. This line-up toured extensively in Europe during the end of 1971 (attested by the 2008 release, Drop) and attended the recording of their next album, but further musical disagreements led to Howard's dismissal after the recording of the first LP side of Fifth (1972) before the end of 1971 and some months later in 1972 to Dean's departure. They were replaced respectively in 1971 by John Marshall (drums) and in 1972 by Karl Jenkins (reeds, keyboards), both former members of Ian Carr's Nucleus, for the recording of Six (1973), and the band's sound developed even more towards jazz fusion.", "Soft Ware formed in September 1999, featuring Elton Dean, Hugh Hopper, John Marshall (on drums) and long-time friend Keith Tippett. This line-up would only remain together briefly. Then in 2002, another former Soft Machine member, Allan Holdsworth (on guitar), joined the remaining three members of Soft Ware who would rename themselves Soft Works in June 2002. They had changed their name to avoid confusion with Peter Mergener's band Software. As Soft Works, they made their world live debut on 17 August 2002 at the Progman Cometh Festival (at the Moore Theater in Seattle, Washington), released (on 29 July 2003) their only (studio) album, Abracadabra, consisting of all new material recorded at the Eastcote Studios in London on 5\u20137 June 2002, and toured Japan in August 2003, Italy in January and February 2004, and Mexico in March 2004.", "In October 2004, a new variant of Soft Works, with John Etheridge permanently replacing Holdsworth, took the name of \"Soft Machine Legacy\" and performed their first two gigs (two Festival shows on 9 October in Turkey and 15 October in Czech Republic), Liam Genockey temporarily replacing John Marshall who had ligament problems (the first Soft Machine Legacy line-up being consequently: Elton Dean, John Etheridge, Hugh Hopper and Liam Genockey). Later on, Soft Machine Legacy released three albums: Live in Zaandam (2005), the studio album Soft Machine Legacy (2006) recorded in September 2005 and featuring fresh material and the album Live at the New Morning (2006).
