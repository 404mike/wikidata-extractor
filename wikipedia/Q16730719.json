He was nominated for one Emmy Award in 2009, as part of the sound editing team on The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, and three Golden Reel Sound Awards for \u201cUnfaithful,\u201d \u201cDe-Lovely\u201d and \u201cRameses\u201d, and collaborated with composer Jan AP Kaczmarek on the Oscar winning score for the movie \"Finding Neverland\".Kennedy moved to Bucks County Pennsylvania in 2002 to concentrate on fine art photography. He developed a technique which he calls Photo Luminism, after noticing an effect created when taking pictures of harbor lights in 2008. The images are created entirely in-camera in a single exposure and with no creative post additions. The abstracted images are hot-printed onto specially treated metal, a process that maximises the appearance of light emanating from within the image, on an entirely flat and mirror-like surface. Commissions for his work can be seen in exclusive hotels around the world.\nIn 2016 Kennedy's proposal for the New Hope Arts Outdoor Sculpture Contest, \"Exhibitionist,\" based on three of his Photo Luminism images, was a winner and was subsequently built in opaque fiberglass by Kennedy and his partner Mark Hutzky. The larger than life three-piece sculpture is internally illuminated by almost 2000 animated LEDs. It was installed in New Hope PA in October 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "De-Lovely", "response": ["| Christopher Kennedy"]}, {"page": "Jan A. P.
