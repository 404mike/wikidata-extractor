On 3 November, West Ham played their first FA Cup game, a third qualifying round fixture against local amateur club Olympic at the Memorial Grounds. The match was a one-sided affair, with the away team goalkeeper Meates performing well to keep the scoreline at 1\u20130, after Fenton had scored 10 minutes in with a ball that had appeared to be meant as a cross. After an injury to Charlie Dove, the club signed Willie Kelly from Hamilton Academical. His debut came against Bristol Rovers on 24 November.
