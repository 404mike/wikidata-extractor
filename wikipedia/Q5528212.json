Massey was one of the first players to progress through the Watford affiliated Harefield Academy, where he broke into the first-team in 2010. During his time with Watford, Massey was loaned to Wealdstone, Yeovil Town and twice to Colchester United. In 2012, Massey joined Colchester on a permanent basis, where he made over 150 league appearances. He joined Leyton Orient in the summer of 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Doyle (footballer)", "response": ["In June 2015, Doyle signed a two-year contract with Blackpool, newly relegated to League One. He was named club captain, and selected as starting goalkeeper, ahead of Kyle Letheren, for the opening match of the season, away to Colchester United. He made several saves to keep his team in the match, but damaged a shoulder in thwarting Colchester's Gavin Massey and had to leave the field. After an initial prognosis of three months out, a scan suggested he could return to action within a month. He was back in the team for the visit to Scunthorpe United on 5 September, and produced a man-of-the-match performance that earned him a place in the Football League's Team of the Week as Blackpool won their first match of the season. Ankle ligament damage suffered in early November kept him out until the new year."]}, {"page": "Queens' School", "response": ["* Gavin Massey, footballer for Wigan Athletic"]}, {"page": "Joe Dunne", "response": ["Dunne immediately signed three players on loan; forward Jabo Ibehre from MK Dons and Arsenal duo Craig Eastmond and Sanchez Watt, All three players went straight into the first team squad for Dunne's first match as Colchester manager against Hartlepool United. After falling behind in the sixth minute, Colchester hit back with goals from Gavin Massey and two from new signing Ibehre to win 3\u20131. After winning four of his first seven games, ending the club's eight-game winless start to the 2012\u201313 season, Dunne considered quitting the club in January 2013 following a record ninth consecutive loss for Colchester, with the club struggling at the lower end of League One.

After the match, he described netting his first goal for the club and helping them win as \"the best feeling ever\". Watt provided two assists in his next match as Colchester overcame Carlisle United 2\u20130 on 20 October, setting up both Eastmond and Ibehre with low crosses. However, he was forced off in the second half after picking up an injury. He scored his second and final goal of his loan spell on 27 October when he came on as a second-half substitute for Gavin Massey, handing the U's a 2\u20130 lead in what would finish a 2\u20132 draw with Shrewsbury Town at the New Meadow. Watt was to play the final game of his stint with Colchester on 3 November, when the U's faced Essex neighbours Chelmsford City in the first round of the FA Cup, having been given the go ahead by his parent club to play in the fixture. Colchester lost the match to their Conference South counterparts by 3\u20131, as Watt suffered a torn hamstring, ruling him out for several weeks and cutting his loan short. United manager Joe Dunne confirmed that Watt was likely to return to the Emirates for treatment. Despite featuring just seven times in his time with the club, Watt left a lasting impression on Dunne, with the Colchester boss affirming his interest in signing the player should he decide to leave Arsenal.", "Once again, Watt suffered a disrupted pre-season for Colchester, having been ruled out over the summer break with a knee injury. He returned on 25 July 2014 when he participated in the club's 2\u20132 friendly draw with Dover Athletic. He missed the start of the season after suffering from tendonitis, and made his return from injury for the under-21 development squad as they held Sheffield United to a 0\u20130 draw in their Professional Development League Two fixture.

His second of the season completed a resounding 3\u20130 victory against League One's bottom club Crewe Alexandra on 27 September as he diverted home a Freddie Sears cross from close range. Watt converted a penalty won by Rhys Healey in a 3\u20133 Football League Trophy draw with Gillingham on 8 October. He netted his fourth goal of the season in Colchester's 6\u20133 FA Cup first round meeting with Gosport Borough on 9 November, converting Freddie Sears' cross on the volley from six yards, before scrambling home Colchester's equaliser at 1\u20131 in their 3\u20132 away defeat at Barnsley on 14 November.
