Port Vale tried to hire him after sacking Roy Sproson in October 1977, but he rejected their terms. He was appointed as manager of Newcastle United the following month, after Richard Dinnis's brief and unsuccessful reign at St James' Park. He gave Kenny Wharton his first professional contract, who would go on to play for the club for eleven years. He also signed Peter Withe, Alan Shoulder, and Bobby Shinton. He could not stop the \"Magpies\" suffering relegation out of the First Division in the 1977\u201378 season. He could only take United to two mid-table finishes in the Second Division in 1978\u201379 and 1979\u201380, before he was fired just weeks into the 1980\u201381 season after his team were knocked out of the League Cup by Third Division club Bury. Arthur Cox was appointed as his successor."]}, {"page": "1978 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Welsh third-tier side Wrexham were Arsenal's sixth round opponents, the match taking place in front of 25,000 supporters at the Racecourse Ground.  An early header from Wrexham's prolific striker Dixie McNeil went wide of Pat Jennings' post and 25 minutes in, Macdonald tapped home after Stapleton's header was parried by Wrexham goalkeeper Eddie Niedzwiecki.  Wrexham increased their tempo and were denied by the referee as he disallowed a Bobby Shinton goal for offside.  The Welsh side equalised midway through the second half, with a McNeil header, his eleventh goal of his FA Cup campaign.  Arsenal quickly retook the lead through a Sunderland header, and extended it to 3\u20131 in the 73rd minute after a Liam Brady slice was delicately finished by Willie Young.  Graham Whittle pulled one back for Wrexham with ten minutes to go but the match ended 3\u20132 and Arsenal were through.  The semi-final, played at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge as a neutral venue, was against lower-league Orient who had already knocked out First Division teams Norwich City, Chelsea and Middlesbrough.  Arsenal took the lead in the fifteenth minute through a deflected Macdonald strike, and doubled their advantage three minutes later as Macdonald scored again, this time courtesy of a deflection by Orient defender Glenn Roeder.  Graham Rix extended the North London club's lead midway through the second half to see Arsenal into the final as 3\u20130 victors."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Bobby Shinton"]}]}}
