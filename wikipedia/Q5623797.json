On 19 December, Wales and the All Blacks met at the Cardiff Arms Park with the New Zealand team so far unbeaten in the tour. Welsh hopes were raised after two New Zealand draws against Swansea and Ulster, and Wales were favourites to win the contest.Smith (1980), pg. 348 The game did not start as was expected, and Wales were chasing the game after New Zealand took an early lead. In the last twenty minutes Wales appeared to raise their game and started playing offensive rugby. Gareth Griffiths returned to the field despite dislocating his shoulder and Clem Thomas moved back into the pack and the Welsh play became more focused. Gwyn Rowlands kicked a penalty to bring the scores level and with five minutes to go Clem Thomas made a dash down the left hand touchline. With his path cut off by the All Black defense, Thomas cross-kicked the ball for Jones to take it on the bounce. Jones rounded Ron Jarden on the inside and scored his most memorable and final try of his Welsh career. With Rowlands converting the score Wales had beaten New Zealand 13\u20138."]}, {"page": "1928 in Wales", "response": ["*19 December \u2013 Gwyn Rowlands, rugby union international (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "2010 in Wales", "response": ["*30 April \u2013 Gwyn Rowlands, rugby union international, 81"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2010", "response": ["*Gwyn Rowlands, 81, English-born rugby football player for Wales."]}, {"page": "Gwyn (name)", "response": ["*Gwyn Rowlands (1928\u20132010), English rugby player"]}]}}
