He is best known for his complete translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls into English; his research focused on the Dead Sea Scrolls and other Ancient Hebrew writings in Aramaic such as the Targumim, and on the life and religion of Jesus. Vermes was one of the most important voices in contemporary Jesus research, and he has been described as the greatest Jesus scholar of his time. Vermes' written work on Jesus focuses principally on the Jewishness of the historical Jesus, as seen in the broader context of the narrative scope of Jewish history and theology, while questioning and challenging the basis of the Christian doctrine on Jesus.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Resurrection of Jesus", "response": ["The empty tomb and the post-resurrection appearances are never directly coordinated to form a combined argument. While the coherence of the empty tomb-narrative is questionable, it is \"clearly an early tradition.\" G\u00e9za Vermes rejects the literal interpretation of the story, as being proof of the resurrection, and also notes that the story of the empty tomb conflicts with notions of a spiritual resurrection. According to Vermes, \"[t]he strictly Jewish bond of spirit and body is better served by the idea of the empty tomb and is no doubt responsible for the introduction of the notions of palpability (Thomas in John) and eating (Luke and John).\"", "According to Dunn, the appearances to the disciples have \"a sense of obligation to make the vision known.\" Helmut Koester states that the stories of the resurrection were originally epiphanies in which the disciples were called to a ministry by the risen Jesus, and at a secondary stage were interpreted as physical proof of the event. He contends that the more detailed accounts of the resurrection are also secondary and do not come from historically trustworthy sources, but instead belong to the genre of the narrative types. Biblical scholar G\u00e9za Vermes argues that the resurrection is to be understood as a reviving of the self-confidence of the followers of Jesus, under the influence of the Spirit, \"prompting them to resume their apostolic mission.\" They felt the presence of Jesus in their own actions, \"rising again, today and tomorrow, in the hearts of the men who love him and feel he is near.\" According to Gerd L\u00fcdemann, Peter convinced the other disciples that the resurrection of Jesus signaled that the end-times were near and God's Kingdom was coming, when the dead who would rise again, as evidenced by Jesus.

Sanders dismiss the accounts as pious fiction, Raymond E. Brown sees them as having been constructed from historical traditions which predate the Gospels. According to Brown, there is no uniform agreement among scholars on the historicity of the accounts, e.g., most of those scholars who reject the historicity of the birth at Bethlehem argue for a birth at Nazareth, a few suggest Capernaum, and other have hypothesized locations as far away as Chorazin.The birth of the Messiah by Raymond Brown 1993  p. 513 Bruce Chilton and archaeologist Aviram Oshri have proposed a birth at Bethlehem of Galilee, a site located  from Nazareth at which remains dating to the time of Herod the Great have been excavated.

G\u00e9za Vermes also views the crucifixion as a historical event but believes this was due to Jesus\u2019 challenging of Roman authority.A Century of Theological and Religious Studies in Britain, 1902\u20132002 by Ernest Nicholson 2004  pp. 125\u2013126 On the other hand, Maurice Casey and John P.

Jesus was a Jewish preacher who taught that he was the path to salvation, everlasting life, and the Kingdom of God. A primary criterion used to discern historical details in the \"third quest\" is that of plausibility, relative to Jesus' Jewish context and to his influence on Christianity. Contemporary scholars of the \"third quest\" include E. P. Sanders, G\u00e9za Vermes, Gerd Theissen, Christoph Burchard, and John Dominic Crossan.  In contrast to the Schweitzerian view, certain North American scholars, such as Burton Mack, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a Cynic sage than an apocalyptic preacher.", "The charismatic healer portrait positions Jesus as a pious and holy man in the view of G\u00e9za Vermes, whose profile draws on the Talmudic representations of Jewish figures such as Hanina ben Dosa and Honi the Circle Drawer and presents Jesus as a Hasid.Vermes, Geza, Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels, Minneapolis, Fortress Press 1973. Marcus Borg views Jesus as a charismatic \"man of the spirit\", a mystic or visionary who acts as a conduit for the \"Spirit of God\". Borg sees this as a well-defined religious personality type, whose actions often involve healing. Borg sees Jesus as a non-eschatological figure who did not intend to start a new religion, but his message set him at odds with the Jewish powers of his time based on the \"politics of holiness\".
