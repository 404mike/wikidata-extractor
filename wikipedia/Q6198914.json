He was tasked with keeping the club steady whilst it struggled with financial problems. He decided to cut back on the club's youth coaching spending, and as a result Wrexham's youth structure was downgraded from an Academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius R\u00f8vde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5\u20130 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground."]}, {"page": "Sore Throat (grindcore band)", "response": ["Sore Throat were formed in 1987 by Richard \"Militia\" Walker (vocals; of Wartorn and Warfear) and Nick Royles (drums). After a short-lived false start that involved Mick Harris & Jim Whitley from Napalm Death on vocals and bass respectively, with Rich actually playing guitar, they soon recruited John \"Doom\" Pickering (bass; previously a member of Doom, Pelvic Thrust, Police Bastard, and Cain), Brian \"Bri\" Talbot (guitar; also previously associated with Doom and Pelvic Thrust, as well as Ackworth St. Chaos Front, Metal Motherfuckers from Mars, Bugeyed, Warfear, Woodhouse Rejects, Stalingrad, Blood Sucking Feaks, Devils, and Virtual Reality). The band were vehemently opposed to what they saw as commercialism with the hardcore scene, and used ridicule to lyrically lambast the likes of Napalm Death, Sex Pistols, Suicidal Tendencies, D.R.I., OLD, Wehrmacht, and S.O.D.. Other lyrics mocked Nazis, capitalism, and the straight edge movement. The band developed a style completely based on improvisation: all of their musical output was made up on the spot, without rehearsals, during recording sessions."]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Jim Whitley (3)"]}, {"page": "List of professional sports families", "response": ["| Jim Whitley, Jeff Whitley"]}]}}
