Anne Boursiquot followed him to London in 1828, taking all but one of her children with her. Consequently, from then on Boucicault attended various schools in and around London, about which there is a good deal of confusion, which has been dealt with by  Richard Fawkes in a biography. For about four years, from 1829, he seems to have attended a very small private school in Hampstead kept by a Mr Hessey, then between 1833 and 1835 was at University College School, where he began his friendship with Charles Kenney. He later recalled having boarded in Euston Square with a Rev. Henry Stebbing, a historian. There is then a gap of two years, when Fawkes believes Boucicault may have attended Rowland Hill's Bruce Castle School, as stated in the Dictionary of National Biography. In 1837, he was enrolled at Wyke House, a school at Sion Hill, Brentford, kept by a Dr Alexander Jamieson, where he appeared in a school play, in the part of Rolla in Sheridan's Pizarro, and wrote his own first play, The Old Guard, which was produced some years later.Richard Fawkes, Dion Boucicault (Ardent Media, 2011), pp. 23\u201325 After that, according to some accounts he attended a school in Dublin, before returning to London as an apprentice civil engineer to Lardner.Peter Thomson, \"Biographical Record\" in Plays by Dion Boucicault (CUP Archive, 1984), pp. 15\u201318", "* Richard Fawkes, Dion Boucicault (Quartet books, 1979)"]}, {"page": "Fawkes", "response": ["* Richard Fawkes (born 1944), British writer and director"]}, {"page": "John Leeson", "response": ["Leeson's vocal contributions to Doctor Who can also be heard as other characters in the serials The Invisible Enemy and Remembrance of the Daleks.
