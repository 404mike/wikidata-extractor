He was MP for the constituency and then the reformed Pontefract and Castleford constituency until he died in office at the age of 64. Playwright James Graham has attributed Harper's death to his  decision to \"[delay] emergency surgery in his determination to never miss a vote\".At the by-election held after Harper's death, the seat was held for Labour by Geoffrey Lofthouse.\nHarper was from a working-class background working at Ackton Hall Colliery, Featherstone. He lived at 11 Bedford Close, Featherstone with his wife Gwen and youngest daughter Pat.
