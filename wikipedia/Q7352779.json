The game was to cater primarily to a female audience around 30 years of age. It was to be released for Microsoft Windows, Mac, iPhone, Wii, and web browsers, but the game was put on hold while nDreams focused on other projects. The game was planned to be dialogue-heavy with a large mix of content with cutscenes, non-interactive in-game sequences, comic strip storytelling, and in-game conversations to develop the plot. Players would have needed to gather clues to solve puzzles, play bejeweled style mini-games and slide puzzles to complete the game. At the end of the season, players would have eventually taken down Keane Global Developments and solve the mystery behind their corporate motives. The story was being written by Kate Pullinger, with help from comic book writer Gordon Rennie, the music was to be composed by Tim Wright, and it was to be directed by Robin Shepperd. The first season of the game was to be composed of six ninety-minute episodes, and they were to be released on either a weekly or bi-weekly schedule. It was being developed with the Unity engine. After a great response to an early demo, Venus Redemption was put on hold while nDreams focused on other projects, such as PlayStation Home and other third party projects. It was initially announced in 2009, but no further updates on its status have been released as of   , ."]}]}}
