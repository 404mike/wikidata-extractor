He was the son of a West Indian planter and an Irish mother. He grew up to be an abolitionist. He founded the Medical Society of London in 1773, convinced that a combined membership of physicians, surgeons and apothecaries would prove productive. As the oldest such in the United Kingdom, it remains as a forum for all branches of medicine, housed in London's medical community at Lettsome House, Chandos Street, near Cavendish Square. Lettsom was its mainstay, as  founder, president (1775\u20131776, 1784\u20131785, 1808\u20131811 and 1813\u20131815) and benefactor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Cullen", "response": ["Cullen was a beloved teacher, and many of his students became influential figures.
