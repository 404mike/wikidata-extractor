McDonald was a defender of great control and positional sense who also had a happy knack of scoring goals.\nHe played for King Street Sports club in Aberdeen before joining Aston Villa in 1971, turning professional in September 1972. A Scottish youth international, he played in the 1972 Little World Cup when Frank Gray and Kenny Burns were among his contemporaries. After helping Villa to promotion to Division One in 1974-75 and picking up a 1975 League Cup Winners' medal, a \u00a340,000 transfer took him to Coventry City. He played thirty-three starting games and six substitute appearances in the league while at Villa Park, scoring once.\nAt Coventry he made one hundred and sixty-one consecutive appearances in the League, scoring fourteen goals. Coventry at this time played a very adventurous game and McDonald was encouraged to get forward and join in the attack. One of his best goals for the Sky Blues came in a famous Christmas time win over Norwich City, a game which Coventry eventually won 5-4. For his goal, Bobby was stationed on the by-line just outside the six yard box. He somehow managed to curl the ball inside the near post past Kevin Keelan in the Norwich goal.\nManchester City signed him for \u00a3270,000 in October 1980. Again he was a consistent regular amassing ninety-six League appearances and netting eleven times. McDonald was in the City team which lost the 1981 FA Cup Final to Tottenham Hotspur. He went to Oxford United in September 1983 and won a Third Division medal in his first season, followed by a Second Division medal in 1984-85. In League fixtures with Oxford he made ninety-four appearances and scored fourteen goals. He went to Leeds on a month's loan in February 1987, before joining them in a \u00a325,000 deal to help United's push towards the Play-offs, but took no part in their progress to the FA Cup Semi-Final as he was Cup-tied.\nInjury cost him his place the following season and he was loaned to Wolves for six matches in February 1988. Granted a free-transfer in May 1988, he joined VS Rugby in the close season. He later played for Burton Albion, joining the Brewers in the summer of 1989, and after that moved around the Non-League scene with some regularity.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["|  Bobby McDonald 47 Barry Powell 47", "|  Bobby McDonald", "|  Tommy Hutchison 45 Bobby McDonald 45"]}, {"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["During the 1986 close season, Bremner spent \u00a3125,000 on 29-year-old Sheffield United striker Keith Edwards, and a further \u00a380,000 to bring in 31-year-old Carlisle United defender Jack Ashurst and Newcastle United defender Peter Haddock. Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (\u00a315,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free transfer from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (\u00a335,000 from Doncaster Rovers, having also signed him whilst at Doncaster). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986\u201387 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for \u00a3840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for \u00a3110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for \u00a372,000 and \u00a3200,000 respectively. A 2\u20131 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs by the end of the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3\u20132 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1\u20130 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's.

His ability led to a proposed \u00a3440,000 transfer to Manchester United in 1979 which failed to go through when he failed a medical on a suspect back. This move would have made him the world's most expensive goalkeeper. He earned two caps for the Scotland national football team, and was Scotland's second-choice goalkeeper at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The 1977\u201378 season saw Jim playing in Coventry's most exciting top-flight team. A side containing Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby McDonald and Tommy Hutchison played a brand of attacking football that swept many teams aside, often by large margins of victory. One of the most memorable games of that year came at Christmas when Norwich City visited Highfield Road. The game reached its zenith in the final minutes when Blyth saved John Ryan's penalty kick to help Coventry to a 5\u20134 victory. In the same season he was Man of the Match in the home game against Liverpool when he turned in a faultless performance in a 1-0 victory, making several saves in particular from David Fairclough and a penalty from Phil Neal."]}]}}
