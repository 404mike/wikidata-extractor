Sloan Foundation, which seeks \"to enhance public understanding of science and technology in the modern world\". According to Audiofile Magazine, which pronounced this production the 2006 D.J.S.

I got the point. I was suspicious of the cultivated European voices translating the words of the survivors. I resented the ominous music, the pregnant pauses, the mechanical alternations of scenes of modern Hiroshima in livid, living color with the black\u2010and-white disaster footage of 1945 newsreels. Where was the center of this irony and at whose expense? I disliked the manipulation of my emotions by crude juxtaposings of disfigured women and department store mannequins with American wigs, of missing ears and honky\u2010tonk acts, of a river of corpses and night baseball. I thought the subtleties of Dr. Lifton's book were obscured by a piling\u2010on of images intended, and guaranteed, to shock. Mutilated bodies look the same, don't they, at death camps and at Dresden and at train wrecks? What, in this wretched century, is so special about Hiroshima?\""]}, {"page": "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series", "response": ["| Peter Goodchild, producer; Lindsay Law, coordinating producer"]}, {"page": "Goodchild", "response": ["*Peter Goodchild (born 1939), BBC television producer and editor"]}, {"page": "British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series", "response": ["| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1978 || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Marie Curie || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Peter Goodchild, John Glenister", "| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1981 || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Oppenheimer || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Peter Goodchild, Barry Davis"]}, {"page": "Kate McAll", "response": ["| Adapted from the original trial transcript by Peter Goodchild"]}, {"page": "British Academy Television Award for Best Factual Series or Strand", "response": ["| Horizon || Peter Goodchild and the production team", "| Horizon || Peter Goodchild ", "| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1973 || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Horizon || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Peter Goodchild and the production team", "| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1975 || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Horizon || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Peter Goodchild, Bruce Norman", "| Horizon || Peter Goodchild", "| Horizon || Peter Goodchild"]}, {"page": "Goodchild, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Goodchild"]}, {"page": "British Academy Television Award for Best Specialist Factual", "response": ["| Microbes and Men || Peter Goodchild"]}]}}
