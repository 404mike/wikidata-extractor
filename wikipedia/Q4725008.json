They secured a deal with Warner label, Atlantic, and went on to record an album - The Black Box - in Berlin and Brussels, from which the first single (\"Time Bomb\") charted very briefly.\nAround 1986 he provided, along with other Friction Groove members, the core band behind Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, who had just arrived in London from Dublin. Ali was later sacked.\nBetween 1992 and 1994 Ali McMordie was executive producer for the Peace Together Irish concert events. Since 1994 he has been the tour manager for American artist Richard Hall AKA Moby (with whose band he has sometimes played bass). Ali has also been used as the live bassist for Belfast singer-songwriter Dan Donnelly, having played in Dan's live band at the Beautiful Days Festival 2006 in Devon.\nIn 2006, it was announced that McMordie was to rejoin Stiff Little Fingers for their current tour, and subsequently that he was rejoining the band on a permanent basis.
