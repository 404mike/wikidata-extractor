He proposed that dental characters are expressed in morphogenetic gradients along the dentition, which could therefore be used to study evolution. This became known as Butler's Field Theory. He was Professor of Zoology at Royal Holloway, University of London, where he was the Head of the Department of Zoology from 1956 to 1972, and where he established the first course on mammalogy in the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Morganucodon", "response": ["In the summer of 1947, fieldwork was done at Duchy Quarry in Glamorgan in southern Wales. Grey conglomerate that formed fissure fill deposits within karstic voids in Carboniferous limestone was extracted. In 1949, Walter Georg K\u00fchne noted the lower cheek tooth of a primitive mammal while examing samples of the rock. He named it Morganucodon watsoni, with the genus name being derived from Morganuc, which K\u00fchne stated was the name of South Glamorgan in the Domesday Book, with the species name being in honour of D. M. S. Watson. Additional remains of M. watsoni were described by K\u00fchne in 1958. Also in 1958, Kenneth Kermack and Frances Mussett described additional remains from Pant Quarry, about a mile from Duchy Quarry, that had been collected in 1956. In August 1948, an expedition to Lufeng in Yunnan, China yielded a 1 in (2.5\u00a0cm) long skull. It was shortly sent to Beijing (then Peking) and then eventually sent out of China, and deposited with Kenneth Kermack at University College London in 1960. The specimen was preliminarily described in 1963 by Harold W. Rigney, who noted the similarity to Morganucodon from Britain, and considered it cogeneric, naming the new species Morganucodon oehleri in honor of the reverend Edgar T. Oehler, who had originally collected the specimen. In 1978 C. C. Young described Eozostrodon heikuopengensis from the Hei Koa Peng locality near Lufeng, based on an associated skull and dentary, as well as a right maxilla and associated dentary.C.-C. Young. 1978. New materials of Eozostrodon. Vertebrata PalAsiatica 16:1-3 A revision by William A. Clemens in 1979 assigned this species to Morganucodon, based on its close similarity to the two previously named species. In 1980 Clemens named the species Morganucodon peyeri, from isolated teeth found in Late Triassic (Rhaetian) deposits near Hallau, Switzerland, with the species being named after paleontologst Bernhard Peyer.W. A. Clemens. 1980. Rhaeto-Liassic mammals from Switzerland and West Germany. Zitteliana 5:51-92 In 1981, Kermack, Mussett and Rigney published an extensive monograph on the skull of Morganucodon. In 2016 Percy Butler and Denise Sigogneau-Russell named the species Morganucodon tardus from an upper right molar (M34984) collected from the Watton Cliff locality near Eype in Dorset, England, dating to the late Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic. The species being named after the Latin tardus, late, in reference to it being the youngest member of the genus.Butler, P.M. and Sigogneau-Russell, D. 2016.
