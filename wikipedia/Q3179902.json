American Jeeps, which were able to deal with the harsh desert terrain better than other transport, were cut down, adapted and fitted with Vickers K machine guns fore and aft. Stirling also pioneered the use of small groups to escape detection. Finding it difficult to lead from the rear, Stirling often led from the front, his SAS units driving through enemy airfields to shoot up aircraft and crew, replacing the early operational strategy of attaching bombs to enemy aircraft on foot."]}, {"page": "Lewes bomb", "response": ["The Lewes bomb was a blast-incendiary field expedient explosive device, manufactured by mixing diesel oil and Nobel 808 plastic explosive. It was created by Lieutenant Jock Lewes, one of the original members of L Detachment SAS in 1941. The SAS needed a combined incendiary and explosive device light enough to be carried by a small group of commandos yet powerful enough to destroy and set fire to aircraft on an enemy airfield. Weighing approximately , the Lewes bomb could be carried in quantity by an individual."]}, {"page": "Jock lewis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jock Lewes"]}, {"page": "Lewes (surname)", "response": ["* Jock Lewes, Australian soldier"]}, {"page": "Alfie Allen", "response": ["| Jock Lewes"]}, {"page": "History of the Special Air Service", "response": ["In October 1941, David Stirling had asked the men to come up with ideas for insignia designs for the new unit.

In regard to mottoes, \"Strike and Destroy\" was rejected as being too blunt. \"Descend to Ascend\" seemed inappropriate since parachuting was no longer the primary method of transport.
