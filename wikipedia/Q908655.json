Mercer observed that the treatment shrank the fabric and increased its tensile strength and affinity for dyes. In the original process of Mercer, no tension was applied. The product was termed fulled cotton, a nod to the process of fulling in woven wool fabric. Mercer regarded the increased affinity for dyes as the most important technical aspect. Mercer also experimented with sulfuric acid and zinc chloride solutions and discovered the parchmentising effect of sulfuric acid."]}, {"page": "Great Harwood", "response": ["Great Harwood is a town with an industrial heritage.

These awards allowed him to complete an MSc (Manchester) in 1947 under the supervision of Dr Hal T Openshaw. When Openshaw was appointed as a Reader at the University of St Andrews, they both moved there and Alan Battersby completed his PhD, which  was awarded in 1949. He was immediately appointed an assistant lecturer at St Andrews. This first appointment extended from 1949 to 1953 but was interrupted by two years owing to a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship he obtained for post-doctoral study in the United States. The first year was spent with Lyman C. Craig at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, New York, working on the peptide antibiotics tyrocidine  and gramicidin S. The second year involved a move to the biochemistry department of the University of Illinois, working with Herbert Carter on pyruvate oxidation factor."]}, {"page": "Ainsworth Mill, Breightmet", "response": ["Mercerisation is a treatment for cotton fabric and thread that gives fabric a lustrous appearance.  The process is applied to materials like cotton or hemp. The process was devised in 1844 by John Mercer of Great Harwood, Lancashire,  who treated cotton fibres with sodium hydroxide. The treatment caused the fibres to swell, which in Mercer's version of the process shrunk the overall fabric size and made it stronger and easier to dye. In 1890 H. A. Lowe held the yarn under tension during treatment. This prevented shrinking and gave the yarn or resulting fabric a lustrous appearance."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| John Mercer||03/06/1852||22 February 1791 \u2013 30 November 1866"]}, {"page": "Listed buildings in Great Harwood", "response": ["|The clock tower commemorates John Mercer, a textile chemist, and is sited in the Town Hall Square.
