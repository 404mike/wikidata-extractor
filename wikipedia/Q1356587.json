The success of the smelting industry in Singapore has led to the formation of a syndicate to enter into competition with the Straits Trading Company. With a capital of $1,250,000, divided into 125,000 shares of $10 each, the Eastern Smelting Company has been registered recently at Penang, and application is now being made to the Federated Malay States Government for permission to export ore. We understand that the concern is composed chiefly of Straits-born Chinese. The export restrictions were aimed, it is stated, at the formation, some time since, of an American tin trust. It is believed that another syndicate, with a similar object in view, is in course of formation. and in November that year, its prospectus was advertised in various newspapers offering shares to the public.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 26 November 1907, Page 1 -- The eastern Smelting Company Limited.

It is proposed to form this Company to purchase and take over as a going concern the well-known business of Tin Smelting carried on during the past 10 years by Mr. Lee Chin Ho of No 73, Dato Kramat Road, Penang, together with the Smelting works and premises belonging thereto and situate at No. 73, Dato Kramat Road, Penang, and all the plant machinery, furnaces, chimney stacks, fixtures, engines, motors, office furniture, implements and permanent appliances whatsoever used in connection therewith and the goodwill of the business and generally to carry on the business of Tin Merchants, Tin Smelters and Tin Refiners. The total purchase price payable to the Vendor Mr. Lee Chin Ho is $300,000 of which $150,000 represents the value of the works and premises and the plant machinery &c., used in connection therewith and $150,000 is the amount payable for the Goodwill. The purchase price will be paid as to $250,000 in fully paid up shares in the Company and as to the balance of $50,000 only in Cash. Arrangements have also been made for taking over the stock and the benefit of all contracts which have been entered into by the Vendor in connection with the business and which shall be in existence at the date of the completion of the purchase at the price to be agreed upon between the Vendor and the Company or in default of agreement at a price to be settled by arbitration. There are at present four furnaces on the premises and the works are capable of turning out 25 tons of refined tin per day. There is  ample space upon the premises in Dato Kramat Road for the erection of more than double the present number of furnaces. It is intended to establish Agencies in the Federated Malay States and elsewhere to buy ore and it is estimated that the present output of refined tin which now averages from 250 to 300 tons per month will be increased to between 800 and 1,000 tons per month. Mr. Herman Jessen, who during the last 6 years has been with the firm of Messrs. Behn Meyer & Co., has had considerable experience in the tin business and will act as the first Managing Director of the Company upon terms to be arranged between himself and the Company. Mr. Lee Chin Ho has also promised the Company the full benefit of his services, skill and experience for the next 3 years at least. The business will be carried on and conducted upon the most modern and up to date lines. All preliminary expenses down to and including the day on which the Company is entitled to commence business will be paid by the Company but no promotion money will be paid. One Hundred Thousand Shares in the Company have already been privately applied for; 25,000 shares go to the Vendor in part payment of the purchase money and the remaining 25,000 Shares are now offered to the Public for subscription at par. As a large number of the leading Tin Miners in the Straits and F. M. S. have applied for the bulk of the Shares in the Company the Directors have every confidence in the future success of the Company.

Prospectuses and forms of application can be obtained at the offices of the Company or from the Company's Bankers or Solicitors. Dated this 6th day of November, 1907. Governor Sir John Andserson officiated at its opening in January 1908.The Straits Times, 18 January 1908, Page 7 -- STRAITS ENTERPRISES. OPENING OF EASTERN SMELTING WORKS. Governor's Speech. COMPETITION WITH STRAITS TRADING COMPANY. Opening Ceremony Performed by Miss Anderson. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Penang, 18, 10 January.20a.m. His Excellency the Governor, Sir John Anderson, K.C.M.G., participated in the opening of the Eastern Smelting Company here to-day. In a speech delivered by His Excellency, he alluded to the present depression in the tin industry, which had been produced by the grave shock sustained by the credit of the markets of the world, and especially by the United States. This depression in the markets, the mining industry in the Federated Malay States had been unable to withstand, and he feared, looking to the history of similar depressions in the past, that the end had not yet been reached. His Excellency also referred to the competition of the Eastern Smelting Company with one of the greatest institutions in the Colony -- the Straits Trading Company. He expressed himself as confident that there would be no cut-throat competition between the two concerns, as there were level-headed men at the head of both. We did not want monopolists in the Colony and Federated Malay States, bu healthy competition resulting in a reasonable margin of profit. His Excellency then dealt with the prospects of the Eastern Smelting Company, with Penang as the gate of Perak and the Siamese Malayan States. The Governor was presented by the management of the new Company with an address in a silver casket. Thereafter, the gubernatorial party went over the works and viewed the smelting process. Miss Anderson opening the works with a gold key, which was thereupon presented by the management for her acceptance. The company appeared to be doing well and at its first ordinary general meeting in October that year a 5 per cent dividend was declared based on the good performance of the prior six months work.The Straits Times, 22 October 1908, Page 8 -- Promising Future for the Eastern Smelting Company. The first ordinary general meeting of the Eastern Smelting company, Limited, was held on Thursday afternoon at the company's registered offices at Penang. The Managing Director, Mr. Herrmann Jessen, occupied the chair and gave a resume of the company's work for the last six months, which was regarded by the large number of shareholders present as very satisfactory. The Chairman said that the Directors were in the happy position of being able to declare an interim dividend of 5 per cent. This would absorb half of the net profit earned during the half-year. The Chairman was very glad to be able to assure the meeting that the outlook for the future was very promising. Mr. J. D. Ke,p. of the Rahman Tin Company, was then elected unanimously to the vacant seat on the Board of Directors, and, with a vote of thanks to the Chairman, the proceedings terminated. Problems arose the following year and by the end of it its works manager had resigned, accusing the managing director and other directors of financial mismanagement.The Straits Times, 2 November 1909, Page 7 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO. AFFAIRS. [Articles] -- EASTERN SMELTING CO. AFFAIRS. (From On Own Correspondent.) Penang. 1 November. The resignation of Mr. J. H. Robertson from the directorate of the Eastern Smelting Co. is alleged to be due to differences with the other directors regarding loans and advances to certain directors from the company's funds.The Straits Times, 2 November 1909, Page 6 -- In connection with the resignation of Mr. J.

Khaw Joo Tok, Lee Chin Ho, Ng Boo Bee, Chung Thye Phin, Chu Shu Ming, Quah Beng Kee, Ong Hong Beng and Loke Chow Kit.The Straits Times, 11 November 1909, Page 7 -- Eastern Smelting Co. [Articles] -- Eastern Smelting Co. ACRIMONIOUS AND PERSONAL RECRIMINATIONS. Protracted Meeting. (From Our Own Cobrbspondbnt.) Penang, 11 November. A crowded meeting of the Eastern Smelting Company was held here yesterday and a protracted sitting took place. Messrs. Jessen and Robertson occupied a considerable time in acrimonious and personal recriminations. Mr. Robertson declared under Jessen the Company lost $76,000 in tin dealings with London in 1908, and $1,100 in 1909.  He also stated Jessen had overdrawn his private accounts by $21,000 and had taken shares for the Company in mining ventures which proved unsuccessful. Jessen rejoined that everything had been done with the knowledge and approval of the board. They had repaid the overdraft. He asserted the unsatisfactory state of the Company's affairs was due to Robertson's failure to keep proper accounts at the Works, incorrect estimates and to refusal to co-operate with the head office. The disclosures revealed an extraordinary state of affairs in  the Company. The directors were empowered to inquire into their own alleged short-comings and to report on the whole of the affairs of the Company to shareholders early in 1910. By March 1911 it had been decided to sell off the business to a London company.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 22 March 1911, Page 6 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO. Sold to London. Penang, 21 Mar 10am.  The meeting of the shareholders of the Eastern Smelting Company today resolved by 29 votes to one to authorise the sale of the concern to a London Company. The Hon A. E. Adams, who presided stated that the present shareholders would get par value of their shares in sterling in the London Company, and it was proposed to sell the business of the whole Company including the assets but excluding the profits for 1910 and for the present year to date of sale. Newspapers in July 1911 carried the prospectus of the new London-based company that was to acquire the business of the Malayan company.The Straits Times, 24 July 1911, Page 6 -- In our advertising columns to-day will be found the prospectus of the new company under the title of Eastern Smelting Co., Ltd., which has been registered in London to take over as a going concern the business of the Eastern Smelting Co., Ltd., Penang, with a capital of \u00a3250,000, divided into 50,000 in preferred ordinary \u00a31 shares and \u00a3200,000 ordinary shares. The chairmanship of the London-based public company was Chung Thye Phin's old friend, former British Resident, Sir Ernest Birch.The Straits Times, 22 August 1911, Page 8 -- EASTERN SMELTING COMPANY. Particulars of the recently issued prospectus. Sir Ernest Birch, ex-British Resident of Perak, is Chairman of company. By the end of November 1911 the transfer from old to new company had been completed and the first general meeting of the new London-based company took place.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 20 November 1911, Page 9 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO LTD. TRANSFER OF THE BUSINESS COMPLETED. FINANCIAL POSITION. The first general meeting of the Eastern Smelting Company, Ltd. was held on 24 Oct. at the offices. 7 Laurence Pountney-hill, E. C., Sir Ernest Woodford Birch, K.M.C.G. (the Chairman), presiding. The secretary (Mr F C Bell) having read the notice convening the meeting and the certificate of the auditors. The Chairman said: the company was incorporated on 20 July this year, and the prospectus offering 50,000 Preferred Ordinary shares of \u00a31 each was issued on 21 July, The issue was very successful, 35,736 shares being applied for in this country and 37,125 in Malaya, making 72,861 in all. Of this number 27,000 shares were allotted as to 13,870 to Malayan applicants and 13,130 to London applicants. Before the formal transfer of the business to the new company could take place, it was necessary for our auditors to prepare a balance sheet showing the vendor company's financial position at 26 July at which date the nominal transfer took place. The preparation of this balance sheet took somewhat longer than was anticipated and it was not until 2 October that the directors were enabled to complete the formal transfer of the business. The transfer has now been duly registered in the Straits Settlements and in the Federated Malay States so the new company is in full possession.The Straits Times, 4 January 1913, Page 3-- EASTERN SMELTING CO. Final Meeting of the Penang Company. The final meeting of The Eastern Smelting Company, Limited (in liquidation) was held at Penang, on Monday, the Hon. A. R. Adams in the chair. After the notice convening the meeting had been read. Mr. P. E. Laws, the liquidator, presented his accounts, which were regarded as very satisfactory. The accounts showed that every shareholder had been transferred to the London company, and had received shares in that company equivalent to his holding in the Penang company, and that after paying for the cost of the liquidation, there was a balance in hand of $1,287.39. The Hon A R Adams said he was sure that the shareholders in the Penang company had no cause to regret the transfer to the London company and proposed that the cash balance in hand be given to the Penang Maternity Hospital. After some discussion this was agreed to. Mr. A. F. G. Anderson moved that the provisional payment of $2,669.15 for the directors' legal costs in the action brought by Mr Robertson against the directors be confirmed. Mr Hoefeld seconded and the motion was carried. Ownership by the London-company of the Penang-company became complete with the liquidation of the Penang public company.The Straits Times, 20 January 1912, Page 9 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO.
