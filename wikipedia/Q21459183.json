During the Blitz on 19 March 1941, incendiary bombs landed on the roof causing it to collapse, burning into the nave. The walls and the tower remained standing but much of the interior was gutted. The church was restored by Sir Albert Richardson in 1953. As part of the post-war restorations, stencils of Mary the Mother of Jesus and St John the Evangelist were installed either side of the Cross (forming a traditional rood) in the side chapel of St Alfege with St Peter by the tempera artist Augustus Lunn."]}, {"page": "St Philip's Church, Hove", "response": ["Another extension was added in 1941: architecture firm Tetley and Felce designed and added a porch. The west end of the church was converted into a hall in 1956; a large (300 sq ft) Sussex-themed mural was painted on the dividing wall by the muralist Augustus Lunn in 1957 and 1958. "]}, {"page": "The Building Centre", "response": ["The Building Centre operated from New Bond Street until its building was destroyed during The Blitz on 12 May 1941. As a result, it moved to Conduit Street and was based there until 1951, when it moved to its present home in Store Street. The building had been designed by the modernist architects Taperell and Haase as a Daimler motor showroom. It is built of reinforced concrete, faced with Portland stone. When converted to the Building Centre, a sgraffito mural by Augustus Lunn was installed in the open-air courtyard and patio, although this has since been hidden or lost."]}, {"page": "St Mary's Church, Welling", "response": ["The church features a large number of works by eminent 20th-century ecclesiastical artists. The liturgical west door is surmounted by a tympanum, which is decorated with sgraffito, an art form rarely found in Britain, but which matches the external design. Sgraffito is a form of tempera mural painting. The artist was Augustus Lunn, the leading proponent of the style in the mid-20th-century. The subjects of the sgraffito are the Joyful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Inside, the reredos on the liturgical east wall is a painted mural of the Ascension by the German \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist, Hans Feibusch, with whom Ford often collaborated. On the walls on either side of the Feibusch mural are stained glass windows, by Claire Dawson. They depict two archangels: St Michael (the patron saint of St Mary's mother church) and Uriel. Dawson was also the artist responsible for mural paintings under the arcades, designed according to the doctrine of typology, whereby the events of the Old Testament foreshadow those of the New Testament. The statue of Virgin and Child is carved of limewood, and was the work of the sculptor Philip Bentham (1913-85). The Stations of the Cross were a later introduction, in 1992. They are ceramic, and were installed by John Dawson."]}]}}
