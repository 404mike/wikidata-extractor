The observer ace claimed to have survived a bizarre flying mishap which earned him the moniker \"The Luckiest Man Alive.\" Hedley also survived uninjured after his plane was shot down in 1918, and he became a prisoner of war. After his immigration to the United States in 1920, he became a regular on the lecture circuit, enthralling American audiences with the stories of his military service.", "link_mentions": {}}}
