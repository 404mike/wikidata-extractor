During his sixteen years there, he studied and published pamphlets on diseases he encountered, like dysentery, and on the medicinal and agricultural effects of the island\u2019s consumable crops, like coffee and sugar. His practice during this time was profitable, and upon his return to Britain in 1784 he had enough money to travel across Europe and to obtain more medical training, earning an M.D. from St. Andrews University. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1775. In 1788, he began a medical practice catering to wealthy patients in London and became a physician to the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vaccine hesitancy", "response": ["After Edward Jenner introduced the smallpox vaccine in 1798, variolation declined and was banned in some countries. As with variolation, there was some religious opposition to vaccination, although this was balanced to some extent by support from clergymen, such as Reverend Robert Ferryman, a friend of Jenner's, and Rowland Hill, who not only preached in its favour but also performed vaccination themselves. There was also opposition from some variolators who saw the loss of a lucrative monopoly. William Rowley published illustrations of deformities allegedly produced by vaccination, lampooned in James Gillray's famous caricature depicted on this page, and Benjamin Moseley likened cowpox to syphilis, starting a controversy that would last into the 20th century."]}, {"page": "John Ring (surgeon)", "response": ["An attack on cow-pox treatment made by Benjamin Moseley, physician to the Chelsea Hospital, brought from Ring a refutation, Then in August 1799, he met Edward Jenner, and they became friends. From 1799 Ring devoted most of his professional life to the cause of vaccination. He had leading medical men in London sign a document acknowledging that cow-pox was a much milder and safer disease than inoculated smallpox. He went to Ringwood in 1808 at the head of a deputation to investigate some supposed failures of vaccination; feeling was running so high that the deputies carried pistols."]}, {"page": "Charles Irving (surgeon)", "response": ["Irving is reported to have died in 1794 in Jamaica, a year repeated in various sources, although Equiano erroneously claimed he died from eating poisoned fish in 1776 or 1777. Benjamin Moseley called him \"the late Doctor Charles Irving\" as early as 1787, and the 1791 Statistical Account of Scotland mentions him in the past tense. The website of the \"Equiano's World\" project at York University, directed by Paul Lovejoy, states \"died 1780s\"."]}]}}
