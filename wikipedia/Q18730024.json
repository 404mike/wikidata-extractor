During his sixteen years there, he studied and published pamphlets on diseases he encountered, like dysentery, and on the medicinal and agricultural effects of the island\u2019s consumable crops, like coffee and sugar. His practice during this time was profitable, and upon his return to Britain in 1784 he had enough money to travel across Europe and to obtain more medical training, earning an M.D. from St. Andrews University. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1775. In 1788, he began a medical practice catering to wealthy patients in London and became a physician to the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.", "link_mentions": {}}}
