In 1833 she wrote a novella, The Green Dwarf, using the name Wellesley. Around about 1833, her stories shifted from tales of the supernatural to more realistic stories. She returned to Roe Head as a teacher from 1835 to 1838. Unhappy and lonely as a teacher at Roe Head, Bront\u00eb took out her sorrows in poetry, writing a series of melancholic poems. In \"We wove a Web in Childhood\" written in December 1835, Bront\u00eb drew a sharp contrast between her miserable life as a teacher and the vivid imaginary worlds she and her siblings had created. In another poem \"Morning was its freshness still\" written at the same time, Bront\u00eb wrote \"Tis bitter sometimes to recall/Illusions once deemed fair\". Many of her poems concerned the imaginary world of Angria, often concerning Byronic heroes, and in December 1836 she wrote to the Poet Laureate Robert Southey asking him for encouragement of her career as a poet. Southey replied, famously, that \"Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and it ought not to be. The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation.\" This advice she respected but did not heed."]}, {"page": "Gomersal", "response": ["The Luddite riots, that occurred in the area in 1812 provided Charlotte Bront\u00eb with material for her novel Shirley.
