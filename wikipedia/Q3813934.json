The celebrity had to grab as many of the notes as possible as they were blown around by the fan. Before the game starts, a chosen player is picked from the call in contestants who got a question correct during the show or from a previous weeks show to be picked, there would be three different bundles of money, usually two known countries and one bundle known as the \"Crinkley Bottom Groats\" which was pegged to a generally random country, all valued within \u00a31,000, sometimes more or sometimes less. Noel would ask the caller three questions based on that week's news. Each correct answer gave the celebrity 20 seconds in the box (up to a total of 60 seconds) accompanied by music and the audience counting down from ten to one. The format was changed slightly in series 4, in which the caller could choose a member of the studio audience to do the \"grand grabbing\" (the audience member would win the same amount of money the caller won). During Season 4, Grab a Grand had a few quirks added in, a few times some modified moments, with balloons inside the box, the walls falling down allowing audience members to help, door jammed, cheating, machine broke, even being flipped for Number Cruncher and inside a woman's house too when NTV happened. Then in the first episode of series 5, the box was blown up live during the show and the segment was revamped with the entire studio audience now playing grabbing notes that were being blown around by two large industrial fans as the celebrity would run into to collect, rather than having the three currencies, instead it featured the groats as the main currency, mixed within the groats would be \"Golden Groats\" worth \u00a350 each if collected. There was an incident too when one of the callers had the same name but turned out it wasn't the person who called in, the real call in contestant had their grab a grand game at the start of the next episode as this one featured the grab a grand around the grand house track. Towards the end of series 5 variations were introduced : 'Grab a Granny', 'Grab a Grand Piano', and 'Grab a Grand National' etc.  The money was quickly counted on stage using a Cashmaster counting machine. The last Grab a Grand was done on the last episode of series 5 (coincidentally the 100th episode)."]}, {"page": "Good Morning Britain (1983 TV programme)", "response": ["Other presenters of the show included Chris Tarrant, Anneka Rice, Richard Keys, Kathy Tayler, Lorraine Kelly, Jayne Irving, Dynasty star Gordon Thomson.", "| GMB with Mike Morris and Kathy Tayler"]}, {"page": "Catherine Taylor", "response": ["*Kathy Tayler (born 1960), pentathlete and TV presenter"]}, {"page": "Holiday (TV series)", "response": ["In addition, the teams of reporters who provided regular reviews from holiday destinations have included Sarah Kennedy, Bill Buckley, Kieran Prendiville, Fyfe Robertson, Kathy Tayler, Monty Don, Rowland Rivron, John Cole and Carol Smillie.
