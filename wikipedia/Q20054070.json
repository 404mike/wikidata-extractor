In a continuation of the Central Committee meeting that started the day before, one speaker after another outlined Khrushchev's mistakes, with Mikhail Suslov, Dmitry Polyansky, Alexander Shelepin, Leonid Brezhnev and Petr Shelest denouncing him.Martin McCauley, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union (Routledge, 2014) p343  Among the offenses charged against Khrushchev were that he had tried to develop a cult of personality; that he had presided over the nation's economic decline; that he had brought the Soviet Union to the brink of war in the Suez, in Berlin and in Cuba; and that he had insulted his colleagues and the nation's foreign allies.  The Committee unanimously approved a resolution that \"Recognizing that as a result of mistakes and incorrect actions by Comrade Khrushchev, violating Leninist principles of collective leadership... there has been created a completely abnormal situation, preventing members of the Central Committee Presidium from fulfilling responsible tasks in leading the party and the country\", and went on to admonish him for \"concentrating in his hands great power\" (as both party leader and government leader) and failing to consider the views of the senior party leaders, as well as \"revealing intolerance and rudeness towards comrades in the Presidium and the Central Committee, treating their views with disdain\".Richard Sakwa, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union, 1917\u20141991\" (Routledge, 2005) pp337-338  Khrushchev resigned his positions, and the Party voted to grant him benefits for the rest of his life, including a security staff, his GAZ-13 Chaika limousine and chauffeur, an apartment in Moscow and a dacha to stay at in the countryside, as well as a pension of 500 rubles per month.  Resolving to keep the roles of party and governmental leadership separate, the Central Committee then installed Leonid Brezhnev was installed as the new Communist Party leader and Alexei Kosygin became the new Premier.Dmitri\u012d Volkogonov, Autopsy for an Empire: The Seven Leaders who Built the Soviet Regime (Simon and Schuster, 1998) pp253-254  The news of Khrushchev's surprise ouster was not revealed to Soviet citizens or to the rest of the world until October 16, with a statement in Pravda that said \"A plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU took place on 14 October of this year.
