A West End revival at The Strand Theatre in October 1986 featured Kelly Hunter as Sally Bowles and was the subject of printed criticism by both Jean Ross and her daughter Sarah Caudwell. Later West End revivals starred Toyah Willcox (1987), Jane Horrocks (1993), Anna Maxwell Martin (2006) and Jessie Buckley (2021) playing the part. Samantha Barks portrayed the role in the 2008\u20132009 UK National Tour.", "In a 1986 newspaper article published long after Jean Ross' death, her daughter Sarah Caudwell indicated that Ross disapproved of Minnelli's depiction of Sally Bowles in the 1972 film: \"In the transformations of the novel for stage and cinema the characterisation of Sally has become progressively cruder\" and, consequently, the literary character originally based on Ross had been transmogrified into a freakish vamp."]}, {"page": "Jean Ross", "response": ["During her itinerant youth in the Weimar Republic, Ross was a cabaret singer and fashion model in Berlin. Her Berlin escapades served as the basis for the fictional character Sally Bowles in Christopher Isherwood's The Berlin Stories,: \"Isherwood's Sally Bowles was based on Jean Ross, a spunky British woman whom he met during his Berlin days with W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender\". a work literary critics cited as deftly capturing the hedonistic nihilism of the Weimar era: The Berlin Stories \"form one coherent snapshot of a lost world, the antic, cosmopolitan Berlin of the 1930s, where jolly expatriates dance faster and faster, as if that would save them from the creeping rise of Nazism\". and was later adapted into the stage musical Cabaret. For the remainder of her life, Ross believed the public association of herself with the na\u00efve and apolitical character of Bowles occluded her lifelong work as a professional writer and political activist. Her daughter Sarah Caudwell, who shared this belief, later wrote a newspaper article in an attempt to correct the historical record and to dispel misconceptions about Ross. According to Caudwell; \"in the transformations of the novel for stage and cinema the characterisation of Sally has become progressively cruder and less subtle and the stories about 'the original' correspondingly more high-coloured\".", "Sixty days after the fall of Madrid, Ross gave birth to a daughter by Claud Cockburn. The child, Sarah Caudwell, who was born on 27 May 1939, was the only offspring of their union. Some sources say Ross did not marry Cockburn due to her political beliefs about women's emancipation, but under British law, Cockburn still was married to his first wife Hope Hale Davis; he could not marry Ross at that time without committing bigamy. Whether Ross knew Cockburn was still legally married to Davis is unknown. Several months before her daughter's birth, Ross filed a deed poll in which she changed her surname to Cockburn.", "According to Ross' daughter Sarah Caudwell, her mother detested her popular identification with the vacuous character Sally Bowles. She believed the character's political indifference more closely resembled Isherwood or his hedonistic friends, many of whom \"fluttered around town exclaiming how sexy the storm troopers looked in their uniforms\". Ross' opinion of Isherwood's beliefs is partly confirmed by Isherwood's biographer Peter Parker, who wrote Isherwood was \"the least political\" of W. H. Auden's social circle in Weimar Berlin, and Auden noted the young Isherwood \"held no [political] opinions whatever about anything\"."]}, {"page": "Bouchercon XVII", "response": ["*Sarah Caudwell, The Shortest Way to Hades"]}, {"page": "Bouchercon XXI", "response": ["*Sarah Caudwell, The Sirens Sang of Murder"]}, {"page": "List of authors published as UK first editions by Collins Crime Club", "response": ["* Sarah Caudwell"]}, {"page": "List of biographical dictionaries of women writers in English", "response": ["**entries for: Catherine Aird, Margery Allingham/Maxwell March, Charlotte Armstrong/Jo Valentine, Margot Arnold, Marian Babson, Nikki Baker, Linda Barnes, J.
