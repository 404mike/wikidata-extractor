On the big screen, he has had roles in Submarine X-1 (1968), Superman (1978), Hanover Street (1979) and All About a Prima Ballerina (1980).\nHe has also featured in some of the productions of Gerry Anderson. In addition to voicing the character of John Tracy in the 1968 film Thunderbird 6 (also serving as the film's narrator), Alexander voiced Sam Loover and numerous supporting characters in the television series Joe 90 (1968\u201369). His other Anderson appearances are in the 1969 film Doppelg\u00e4nger, The Secret Service (1969), and as the SHADO HQ radio operator in the television series UFO (1970, as Lt. Keith Ford).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joe 90", "response": ["* Keith Alexander as Sam Loover. Alexander had previously voiced characters in Thunderbird 6 as a replacement for Ray Barrett.

Nevertheless, in his overall assessment of the series, La Rivi\u00e8re asserts that a spy posing as a vicar and driving an antique car would not have appealed to children and that adults would have been disappointed by the series' \"traditional espionage format\".La Rivi\u00e8re, p. 195. Ian Fryer of FAB magazine expresses similar views, writing that \"very little about The Secret Service has obvious appeal to the traditionally young Supermarionation audience.\" He notes that the title sequence marked a departure from Supermarionation's \"tradition of having a thrilling or suspenseful promise of what was to come\", instead \"[making] the series look suspiciously like it might be about the life and work of an elderly vicar.\" Fryer also suggests that prospective foreign buyers were put off by the espionage theme, noting that by the time The Secret Service debuted on British TV, other spy series like The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and The Avengers had already aired their last episodes."]}, {"page": "Thunderbird 6", "response": ["Actors John Carson and Geoffrey Keen provided guest voices, with additions to the regular voice cast in the form of Keith Alexander and Gary Files.

He praises the film's visuals, writing that the Tiger Moth effects were \"some of the best effects work Century 21 would ever create. It is a testament to their skill and ingenuity that, in the motorway sequence, the model shots are indistinguishable from the original.\" However, he questions the lack of action sequences, suggesting that this was disappointing to younger viewers and makes the film \"[feel] like an extended puppet version of holiday magazine programme Wish You Were Here...?\" He argues that this \"unfamiliar air\" to the film is compounded by its voice acting, which he believes sounds more mature than before (a development he attributes to the casting of new actors like Gary Files and Keith Alexander)."]}, {"page": "The New Avengers (TV series)", "response": ["| Julian Holloway, Peter Cellier, Jeremy Young, Patrick Malahide, W.
