Born in Angaston, South Australia, where he was educated, he became a farmer on the Yorke Peninsula and an auctioneer. He served on Maitland Council, of which he was mayor. In 1896, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Yorke Peninsula, transferring to Wallaroo in 1902. He left the Assembly in 1905. In 1912, he was appointed to the Australian Senate as a Liberal Senator for South Australia, filling the casual vacancy caused by the death of Labor Senator William Russell. This was the first time a state government had successfully replaced a Senator with a Senator of a different party, after Labor's failed attempt in 1907 to appoint James O'Loghlin to succeed Joseph Vardon. Defeated in 1913, he was elected in 1914 (with over 95% of the vote) due to the death of Labor Senator Gregor McGregor, which left the Labor Party with only five nominees. They directed the sixth vote to Shannon, resulting in an easy return to the Senate. He joined the Nationalist Party when it formed in 1917, and from 1917 to 1920 served as Chairman of Committees. Shannon did not stand at the 1919 federal election, and his term ended on 30 June 1920. He died in 1926.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Candidates of the 1910 Australian federal election", "response": ["| |Robert Guthrie*Gregor McGregor*William Story* || David CharlestonDavid GordonJohn Shannon"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1913 Australian federal election", "response": ["*On 31 July 1912, John Shannon (Liberal) was appointed as a South Australian Senator to replace William Russell (Labor).", "||John Newlands*James O'Loghlin*William Senior* || Peter AllenJohn ShannonJoseph Vardon || Sir Josiah Symon"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1914 Australian federal election", "response": ["| |Robert Guthrie*John Newland*James O'Loghlin*William Senior*William Story* || |Benjamin BennyPatrick DaleyGeorge JenkinsJohn Shannon*George StewartEdward Vardon"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1917 Australian federal election", "response": ["Three seats were up for election.
