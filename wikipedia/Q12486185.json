Wagner explored the reasons why it was difficult to do, and suggested several possible routes. The following years have seen a number of studies of possible routes through which an appropriately documented descent might be found. These routes typically involve either linkages among the ruling dynasties of the post-Roman Empire Germanic states, or those between the ancient dynasties of the Caucasus and the rulers of the Byzantine Empire.  Though largely based on historical documentation, these proposed routes have invariably resorted to speculation based on known political relationships and onomastics - the tendency of families to name children in honor of relatives is used as evidence for hypothesized relationships between people bearing the same name.  Proposed DFAs vary greatly both in the quality of their research and the degree to which speculation plays a role in their proposed connections."]}, {"page": "Clan Gregor", "response": ["The Clan Gregor held lands in Glen Orchy, Glenlochy and Glenstrae.

In this usage, \"of\" and a place name follow on from a family surname, as in the name \"Aeneas MacDonell of Glengarry\". If the place name is identical to the surname, it is sometimes rendered as \"that Ilk\", e.g. \"Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk\". Recognition of a territorial designation is granted in Scotland by the Lord Lyon to Scottish armigers (those entitled to bear a coat of arms) who own or were born in or are associated with named land, generally in a rural area not forming part of a town. The Lord Lyon advises that for a territorial designation to be recognised there must be \"ownership of a substantial area of land to which a well-attested name attaches, that is to say, ownership of an 'estate', or farm or, at the very least, a house with policies extending to five acres or thereby\".  The territorial designation in this case is considered to be an indivisible part of the name, not in itself necessarily indicating historical feudal nobility, but recognition in a territorial designation is usually accorded alongside the grant or matriculation of a Scottish coat of arms, which effectively confers or recognises minor nobility status, even if not ancient. Despite this, the right to bear a territorial designation can also exist for landowners who are not armigerous, but this right is not made good until receiving official recognition; Learney comments: \"mere assumption is not sufficient to warrant these territorial and chiefly names\".  A person bearing a Scottish territorial designation is either a Feudal Baron, Chief or Chieftain or a Laird, the latter denoting \"landowner\", or is a descendant of one of the same. The Lord Lyon is the ultimate arbiter as to determining entitlement to a territorial designation, and his right of discretion in recognising these, and their status as a name, dignity or title, have been confirmed in the Scottish courts.  In speech or correspondence, a Laird is correctly addressed by the name of his estate (particularly in lowland Scotland) or his surname with designation, e.g. William Maitland of Lethington would be addressed as \"Lethington\" or \"Maitland of Lethington\"."]}, {"page": "Lady Idina Sackville", "response": ["* Diana Denyse Hay, 23rd Countess of Erroll (1926\u20131978),Slains Castle and The Hays of Erroll, Aberdeen Civic Society  who married Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk in 1946.

Historians have distrusted this derivation, though in the 1960s, David Sellar defended a Gaelic derivation.  More recently, historian Alex Woolf has pointed out the conflicting information found in the different versions of the pedigree, and drawn attention to their faulty chronology.  Instead he argues that these pedigrees may derive from an original claim to the descent of Somerled from the Crovan dynasty and the U\u00ed \u00cdmair, subsequently obscured by alterations made to link them to the Scottish and Irish foundation legends.Alex Woolf, The origins and ancestry of Somerled: Gofraid mac Fergusa and 'The Annals of the Four Masters' , Medieval Scandinavia 15 (2005) In any case, the Clann Somhairle based their claim to the Isles on their descent from Somerled's wife, Ragnhildr, the daughter of king Amla\u00edb Derg, and Woolf accepts that the male-line Crovan descent claim underlying the pedigrees may have arisen as a replacement for this female-line derivation from the family.
