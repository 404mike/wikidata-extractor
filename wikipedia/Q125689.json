They also commended the K1 robot costume, but criticised the use of CSO (colour-separation overlay) effects for a number of shots involving the K1 robot, as did Robert Cope. In Doctor Who Episode by Episode, Ray Dexter described Baker's \"over-the-top\" performance as \"compelling\" but the plot as \"a little lazy and derivative, with some terrible science.\" He considered the dialogue \"some of the best we've seen\" but added that \"the story falls into the typical Dicks trap of just having baddies being bad because they're bad, and a logical robot behaving utterly illogically\". He also thought the location work on video \"cheapens the look of the show\" and criticised the effects as \"not good enough, not even for this era\"."]}, {"page": "Elisabeth Sladen", "response": ["She reprised the role in the 1993 Children in Need special Dimensions in Time, and in the 1995 independently produced video Downtime alongside former co-star Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Deborah Watling as Victoria Waterfield. This was her last on-screen appearance as Sarah Jane Smith for some time.", "Sladen played Sarah Jane in several audio plays. Two of them were produced for BBC Radio, The Paradise of Death (Radio 5, 1993), and The Ghosts of N-Space (Radio 2, 1996), together with Jon Pertwee and Nicholas Courtney. In 1997, Sladen won Hall of Fame Actress in Cult TV Awards. Big Finish Productions produced two series of Sarah Jane Smith audio adventures set in the present day, released in 2002 and 2006. Her husband, Brian Miller, appeared in the story Ghost Town. Her daughter Sadie appeared in the audios. Sladen also contributed interviews and DVD commentaries to many of the classic Doctor Who serials she co-starred in."]}, {"page": "Sara Kingdom", "response": ["Jean Marsh had previously appeared in Doctor Who playing King Richard's sister, the Princess Joanna, in The Crusade. Marsh would return to the programme in the 1989 serial Battlefield, playing Morgaine, coincidentally with Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, thus appearing in both his first and last regular Doctor Who episodes. Courtney also played Bret Vyon in Master Plan. In 2007 she appeared opposite the Sixth Doctor and Mel in the Big Finish Productions audio drama The Wishing Beast."]}, {"page": "Wendy Padbury", "response": ["Padbury is now retired and lives in France, having previously worked as a theatrical agent. Nicholas Courtney, Colin Baker and Mark Strickson, all former Doctor Who actors, were among her clients.

Leslie French, who plays the Mathematician, had turned down the role of The Doctor in 1963; thus, his casting was another nod to the series' beginnings in this Silver Anniversary story.Chris Clough on DVD commentary Anton Diffring took the role so that he could travel from his home in France to watch the Wimbledon tennis tournament; Silver Nemesis was his last work as an actor before his death in 1989. The production team tried to get Prince Edward involved in the show, but his office politely declined in March 1988; the programme instead used an Elizabeth II look-alike. Nicholas Courtney makes a cameo appearance, conversing with other visitors in the queue to tour Windsor Castle."]}]}}
