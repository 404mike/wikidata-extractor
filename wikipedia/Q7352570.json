He is notable for his long collaboration with Ruth Manning-Sanders, illustrating many of her collections of fairy tales from all over the world. In much of his work, Jacques employed the stippling technique. \nHe was quoted as saying: \"My preference is for children's books of the more imaginative and fanciful kind, since these leave greater scope for illustrative invention, where I feel most at home. Thus, my work with Ruth Manning-Sanders has proved most satisfying, and the twenty-five books we have done together contain much of the work that I feel personally happiest with.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Janet Frame", "response": ["* 1969.

She contributed to the biography of her friend Quentin Crisp, The Stately Homo. Valery's script for The Passing Out Parade created issues for the six male directors who told her that women did not speak in that manner and that the drama was considered \"too difficult\" for early 1970s television.
