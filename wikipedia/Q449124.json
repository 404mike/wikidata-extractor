It also featured recordings of Martin being trained by experienced rider Ken Fox on an existing wall to overcome dizziness, and being given aerial training to overcome the chief limiting factor, the effect of G-force on the human body. The science was explored by Hugh Hunt of Cambridge University, revealing the equation G=S2/(25*D), where G is G-Force, S is speed in mph, and D is diameter of the wall, in metres. This revealed the chosen location, a hangar on Manby Airfield, would be too small for Martin's desired target of 100\u00a0mph, but with a revised target of 80\u00a0mph while remaining below 7G, the 37.5 metre wall that was ultimately built would suffice. This would allow Martin to challenge a previous claimed record of around 70\u00a0mph, which the programme believed was wrong, determined through video analysis as having been 45\u00a0mph. For the show, Guinness World Records created a new record, Highest speed on a Wall of Death, and set an initial qualifying benchmark of 60\u00a0mph in one of two attempts. On a first attempt, using an Indian Scout motorcycle, Martin managed to achieve 70.33\u00a0mph, while on a second run, on a bike purposely built by Martin (a 1972 Rob North T160 Trident triple), he extended the record to 125.77\u00a0km/h (78.15\u00a0mph). Prior to Martin's attempt, on the smaller wall cyclist Shanaze Reade also set the Guinness record for Highest bicycle speed on a Wall of Death, at 42.94\u00a0km/h (26.68\u00a0mph)."]}, {"page": "2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships", "response": ["|Victoria PendletonShanaze Reade|| 33.661"]}, {"page": "UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Women's team sprint", "response": ["|Victoria PendletonShanaze Reade", "|Victoria PendletonShanaze Reade", "|Victoria PendletonShanaze Reade"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics", "response": ["| team sprint || Victoria PendletonShanaze Reade || Yvonne HijgenaarWilly Kanis || Sandie ClairClara Sanchez"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics", "response": ["In the debut appearance of BMX events at the Olympics, world champion Shanaze Reade finished out of the medals after crashing out of the women's final.
