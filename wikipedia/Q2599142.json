It depicts the early life of the British author Jane Austen and her lasting love for Thomas Langlois Lefroy. American actress Anne Hathaway stars as the title character, while her romantic interest is played by Scottish actor James McAvoy. Also appearing in the film are Julie Walters, James Cromwell and Maggie Smith. This was Ian Richardson's final film performance before his death in the same year as the film's release. The film was produced in cooperation with several companies, including Ecosse Films and Blueprint Pictures. It also received funding from the Irish Film Board and the UK Film Council Premiere Fund.", "There were concerns in some quarters that the American Hathaway was playing a beloved English writer. James McAvoy, who plays Thomas Langlois Lefroy, believed that filming in Ireland made her casting \"a bit safer\" than if they had shot in England. McAvoy accepted the role because he enjoyed Austen's writings and was eager to work with Jarrold, having collaborated with him previously on the 2002 television production White Teeth. McAvoy first assumed that Becoming Jane would be directly associated with Pride and Prejudice, with his character possessing similarities with Mr. Darcy; the actor soon realised however \"that the screenplay was nothing like Pride and Prejudice. The screenwriter probably speculated on some of the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice but it is a completely different story.\""]}, {"page": "Tom Lefroy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Langlois Lefroy"]}, {"page": "Thomas Lefroy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Langlois Lefroy"]}, {"page": "Anthony Lefroy (Irish politician)", "response": ["He was born in Dublin, the eldest son of politician and jurist Thomas Langlois Lefroy, was educated at Trinity College and studied law at the King's Inns (1820) and Lincoln's Inn (1822)."]}, {"page": "Lords Justices of Ireland", "response": ["| Thomas Langlois Lefroy\u00a0LCJ"]}, {"page": "Daniel Robertson (architect)", "response": ["*Carrigglas Manor in County Longford (owned by Thomas Langlois Lefroy, Chief Justice of Ireland from 1852 to 1866))"]}, {"page": "1776", "response": ["* January 8 \u2013 Thomas Langlois Lefroy, Irish politician (d. 1869)"]}, {"page": "Langlois", "response": ["*Thomas Langlois Lefroy (1776\u20131869), Irish-Huguenot politician and judge"]}, {"page": "Tom LeFroy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Langlois Lefroy"]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Thomas Langlois Lefroy, MP 1830\u201341, and son Anthony, MP 1830\u201370."]}, {"page": "Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium", "response": ["*Thomas Langlois Lefroy (1776\u20131869), politician and judge"]}]}}
