In early August 1944, Major General George Erskine, the division's GOC, who had been in command of the division since January 1943, Brigadier William Hinde, commanding the 22nd Armoured Brigade, and up to 100 other officers of the division were removed from their positions and reassigned. Erskine was replaced by Major General Gerald Lloyd-Verney. Historians largely agree that this was a consequence of the \"failure\" at Villers-Bocage and had been planned since that battle.Fortin, p. 10Forty, p. 104Taylor, p. 84Wilmot, p. 398 Historian Daniel Taylor is of the opinion that the battle's result provided an excuse and that the sackings took place to \"demonstrate that the army command was doing something to counteract the poor public opinion of the conduct of the campaign\". Historian and former British Army officer Mungo Melvin has commented approvingly of the 7th Armoured Division's institution of a flexible combined arms structure, which other British armoured divisions did not adopt until after Operation Goodwood.Buckley (2006), pp. 28\u201329"]}, {"page": "Battle of Villers-Bocage", "response": ["David French wrote that the follow-up formations landing in Normandy were on average two days behind schedule and that had the 33rd Armoured Brigade, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division's infantry brigade landed on time, XXX Corps might have been able to secure Villers-Bocage, before the arrival of substantial German forces. Other historians wrote that substantial British forces remained uncommitted during the battle. Mungo Melvin wrote that although the 7th Armoured Division changed its organisation to a flexible combined arms structure, which was not done by the other British armoured divisions until after Operation Goodwood, neither the 131st Infantry Brigade nor the balanced divisional reserve of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion were employed well."]}, {"page": "Third Battle of Kharkov", "response": ["The military historian Bevin Alexander wrote that the Third Battle of Kharkov was \"the last great victory of German arms in the eastern front\",Alexander, Bevin.

Borrowing from a chapter title of the book Manstein by Mungo Melvin, Citino described the battle as a \"brief glimpse of victory\".

Reynolds wrote that Bucknall was at fault for failing to concentrate his forces. D'Este concurred but Bucknall defended his decision claiming the \"49 [Division] ... [had] no recent battle experience and it was important to launch them nicely into their first fighting in a properly coordinated battle, and not bundle them helter-skelter into hot armoured scrapping like that around V[illers]-B[ocage] and Amaye\". Buckley wrote that the operation was a failure of command. Terry Copp wrote that Dempsey continued to underestimate the German strength and commitment to defending the ground they held.
