This was the beginning of a less successful period for the club. John McGovern and then Brian McDermott were given the position of manager, but neither achieved anything greater than a mid-table finish. After McDermott, Colin Lippiatt returned but fared little better. He was replaced by his former boss as Geoff Chapple too came back to Woking. Lippiatt departed in January 2002 and Glenn Cockerill joined as Chapple's assistant. This season ended with the club just one place above the relegation places. In the meantime very significant events had taken place off the field. The downturn in the club's fortunes had led to a financial crisis. With the club facing administration or worse, local businessman and long-time fan Chris Ingram bought the club, becoming chairman in February 2002 with an aim of trying to increase the club's income and to secure its long-term financial stability.", "|  Glenn Cockerill"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Glenn Cockerill"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Case", "response": ["Case played in midfield alongside Glenn Cockerill and Barry Horne and helped to bring on the careers of exciting young players such as Le Tissier, Alan Shearer, Rod Wallace and Jason Dodd. Ian Branfoot succeeded Nicholl as manager in June 1991, and considered that the club could dispense with Case's services and he was transferred to AFC Bournemouth within a few days of Branfoot's appointment, a decision that proved very unpopular with to Saints fans, especially when Case was replaced by the unsuccessful Terry Hurlock, and was one of the key reasons that Branfoot was an unpopular figure with the club's supporters during his two and a half years in charge."]}, {"page": "Frank Gray", "response": ["Gray was appointed manager at Woking on 3 May 2007 on a two-year deal, replacing Glenn Cockerill.

It seemed inevitable that Davis would be sent-off for such an indiscretion. However none of the matchday officials saw the incident. Cockerill's jaw was broken and following the FA's analysis of TV footage Davis was given a then unprecedented 9-match ban and \u00a33,000 fine to him. In fact in his previous 9 seasons he had only been booked a miserly 14 times. Davis was removed from the England squad and lost the opportunity to represent his country. He only played 12 league games, scoring once in the 1988\u201389 title winning season. Davis also suffered a bad thigh injury that plagued him, so he missed the climax of the season at Anfield."]}, {"page": "Andy Townsend", "response": ["In the 1987\u201388 he was a virtual ever-present, playing alongside Jimmy Case and Glenn Cockerill in the Southampton midfield.
