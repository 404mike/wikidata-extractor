The word G\u0127arb is the Arabic word for West, so it should be no surprise that the village is the most westerly place on Gozo. One can see its ancient roots in the centre of the village where some houses have fine examples of decorated stone balconies. G\u0127arb was created as a parish in 1679, a move which gave impetus for the building of a new, baroque parish church. Built between 1699 and 1729, it has an elegant fa\u00e7ade which has been compared with Francesco Borromini's Church of Saint Agnes in Piazza Navona, Rome. The village square, so quintessentially Gozitan, has become the view on many a postcard. On the square is a folklore museum housing all sorts of memorabilia retelling the Islands' rural history. G\u0127arb lies in some of Gozo's most scenic countryside, particularly at Dbie\u0121i, the highest hill on the Island. Also at Dbie\u0121i is a centre for Gozitan crafts. Within the limits of G\u0127arb is the Chapel of San Dimitri. According to legend, the first chapel was built on the cliff side by a woman whose son was freed from captivity by St. Demetrius. Also nearby is the Basilica ta' Pinu, Malta's pre-eminent shrine to the Virgin Mary. It was on this spot in 1883, that a local woman heard the voice of the Virgin. The parish church is dedicated to the visitation of Saint Mary to her cousin Saint Elizabeth. The late Karmni Grima and Fren\u010b tal-G\u0127arb are two of its most renowned villagers."]}, {"page": "Ta' Pinu", "response": ["In 1883, Karmni Grima was walking past the now run down church and heard a voice asking her to recite three Hail Marys'. Over the following years miracles were attributed to the grace of Our Lady of The Assumption to whom the church was dedicated. Francis Portelli also heard the voice coming from the painting. Francis Mer\u010bie\u010ba also known as Fren\u010b tal-G\u0127arb was a devout of Our Lady of ta' Pinu and healed a lot of people in her name.

The voice had told him to honor the  \"Wound of Christ\", which Christ had received while carrying the cross.
