From 1963 to 1965, he appeared in My Fair Lady, sometimes in the role of Freddie. He rejoined D'Oyly Carte from 1965 to 1973, becoming principal tenor. He then played Major Mark Blake in Coronation Street, returned briefly to D'Oyly Carte as a guest artist, and sang in concerts. In 1977 Mason joined Welsh National Opera as a chorister and small part player, where he remained until his retirement in 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Sorcerer", "response": ["|Alexis||Derek Oldham||Charles Goulding||John Dean||Ralph Mason||Meston Reid"]}, {"page": "Princess Ida", "response": ["|Cyril||Charles Goulding||John Dean||Leonard Osborn||David Palmer||Ralph Mason"]}, {"page": "The Gondoliers", "response": ["|Marco||Thomas Round||Ralph Mason||Meston Reid||Meston Reid"]}, {"page": "Destiny (Jan\u00e1\u010dek)", "response": ["* Chandos CHAN3029 (sung in English): Helen Field, Philip Langridge, Kathryn Harries, Peter Bronder, Stuart Kale, Barry Mora, Christine Teare, Elizabeth Gaskell, Dorothy Hood, Catroina Bell, Mark Holland, Rebecca Moseley-Morgan, Samuel Linay, Michael Preston-Roberts, Yolande Jones, Cheryl Edwards, Mary Davies, Gaynor Keeble, Gareth Rhys-Davies, Philip Lloyd-Evans, Ralph Mason, Timothy German, Frances Manning; Welsh National Opera Orchestra and Chorus; Sir Charles Mackerras, conductor (recorded 1989)"]}, {"page": "John Mason", "response": ["* Ralph Mason (John Francis Mason, 1938\u20132016), English tenor"]}, {"page": "Come In from the Rain (Andi Deris album)", "response": ["*Ralph Mason \u2013 drums, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Done by Mirrors", "response": ["*Ralph Mason \u2013 drums, backing vocals, co-lead vocals on \"Do You Really Wanna Know\""]}, {"page": "John Ralph Mason", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ralph Mason"]}]}}
