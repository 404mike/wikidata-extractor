Phillips was one of four Cardiff players in the first match, along with B. B. Mann, Barry Girling and Leonard Watkins. The Welsh team were humiliated when the English scored 13 tries without reply, and the press attacked the Welsh Union secretary Richard Mullock for choosing a 'private' team of friends and elitists rather than the best players available.Smith (1980), pg 470. Phillips himself was a strong supporter of Mulloch, and when Mulloch was challenged in his position as secretary, it was Phillips, along with Horace Lyne, who voiced their opinion strongest in his support.Smith (1980), pg 52.", "Phillips continued his close connection with Welsh rugby, when in 1887 he was chosen to referee the Home Nations match between Ireland and England.Welsh international referee roll of honour His second and final international match he would officiate was the 1889 Championship game between Ireland and Scotland in Belfast.

Rees; but Rees withdrew after W.D. Phillips and Horace Lyne argued Mullock's case, reminding the members how Mullock financed the Union in its early years. Mullock retained his position as Secretary but stood down as Treasurer in favour of William Wilkins.", "In 1886 as part of the Home Nations Championship, Mullock was selected to referee an international game between England and Ireland. This followed on from the previous year when Horace Lyne had refereed the same fixture between the nations. England won both matches by a try, and the fact that two members of the WFU were seen to have 'had a hand' in Irish defeats caused an already strained relationship between Wales and Ireland to worsen.Smith (1980), pg 63.

Under the captaincy of Charlie Lewis, Jones was one of three new caps for Wales, the others being Newport's Horace Lyne and Dr. John Griffin, a stand-in from Edinburgh University.

Rees was educated in his home town and later in Barnstable, and on leaving school followed his father into the local building trade.Smith (1980), p. 98. In 1888, Rees began his long association with rugby when he was appointed as secretary of Neath Rugby Football Club, a position he would hold until 1894, when he was made the club's treasurer. In 1889 he was elected to the Match Committee of the Welsh Football Union, later to be renamed the Welsh Rugby Union, along with Horace Lyne.Smith (1980), p. 51. In a hostile meeting of the WRU in 1891, several members of the board attempted to unseat the then secretary and treasurer Richard Mullock. Rees was proposed by Swansea member William Gwynn as a replacement for the secretary post, but after a plea from Lyne and W.D.

Wales had only been playing rugby as an international country for two years when the team played in the 1883 Championship.

When Wales arrived in Edinburgh the party was a player short for the match, in similar circumstances to the 1882 clash with Ireland,Griffiths (1987), 4:3. and attempts were made to draft a player to fill the missing position. Griffin was at the time studying at Edinburgh University and had played rugby for the University team. Although not Welsh, the fact that he was English, made him the 'least Scottish' person to choose from and was brought into the Welsh squad.Jamie Roberts breathes life for doctors Telegraph.co.uk Griffin was one of three new caps in the Welsh squad, the others being Horace Lyne and John Arthur Jones, all three playing in the pack.
