A former journalist and newspaper editor, Gemmell had his first work of fiction published in 1984. He went on to write over thirty novels. Gemmell's works display violence, yet also explore themes of honour, loyalty and redemption. There is always a strong heroic theme but nearly always the heroes are flawed in some way. With over one million copies sold, his work continues to sell worldwide.\nThe David Gemmell Awards for Fantasy were awarded from 2009 to 2018, with a stated goal to \"restore fantasy to its proper place in the literary pantheon\". A steering group of 18 authors was chaired by writer Stan Nicholls and the award was decided by a public vote.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Achilles", "response": ["* Achilles is a major supporting character in David Gemmell's Troy series of books (2005\u20132007)."]}, {"page": "August 1", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 David Gemmell, English journalist and author (d. 2006)"]}, {"page": "Aeneas", "response": ["Aeneas appears in David Gemmell's Troy series as a main heroic character who goes by the name Helikaon."]}, {"page": "July 28", "response": ["*2006 \u2013 David Gemmell, English author (b. 1948)"]}, {"page": "Odysseus", "response": ["Odysseus is also a character in David Gemmell's Troy trilogy (2005\u20132007), in which he is a good friend and mentor of Helikaon.
