As a result, the number of prisoners being sent to the Andamans grew and the need for a high-security prison was felt.  From August 1889 Charles James Lyall served as home secretary in the Raj government, and was also tasked with an investigation of the penal settlement at Port Blair. He and A. S. Lethbridge, a surgeon in the British administration, concluded that the punishment of transportation to the Andaman Islands was failing to achieve the purpose intended and that indeed criminals preferred to go there rather than be incarcerated in Indian jails. Lyall and Lethbridge recommended that a \"penal stage\" should exist in the transportation sentence, whereby transported prisoners were subjected to a period of harsh treatment upon arrival. The outcome was the construction of the Cellular Jail, which has been described as \"a place of exclusion and isolation within a more broadly constituted remote penal space.\""]}, {"page": "Mu'allaqat", "response": ["The Mu'allaqat exist in many manuscripts, some with old commentaries.

The 8th-century historian Ibn Ishaq held that Abu Bara offered Muhammad a gift of fine horses and camels, which the Islamic prophet refused due to Abu Bara's polytheism. When Muhammad invited Abu Bara to convert, he did not do so, though he also did not reject Islam. Instead, he recommended that Muhammad send a mission to the tribes of the Najd, expressed his wishes for its success and gave the mission promises of safe conduct, though the reason or scope for his protection is not clear. The historian Charles James Lyall doubted that Abu Bara made the visit, citing verses in the Kitab al-aghani, which noted that Abu Bara was ill with a tumor at the time and had sent Labid in his stead with the gift, which was rejected by Muhammad, who sent Labid back with a treatment for Abu Bara's illness.

Al-Rabi influenced al-Nu'man against the Ja'far, prompting Abu Bara's nephew, the future celebrated poet Labid ibn Rabi'a ibn Malik, to recite his first known poem, a rajaz (prosody), in which he humiliated al-Rabi to the extent al-Nu'man expelled al-Rabi from his court in disgrace and granted the Ja'far unspecified requests.
