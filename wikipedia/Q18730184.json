During this period the school moved twice, first to a property on Darlaston Road and then to a building adjoining the All England Lawn Tennis Courts.

At the time, there were few Catholics in the area, so she convinced the Jesuits at Roehampton to start a Mass-centre at her house in Cottenham Park. Seven years later, she commissioned the construction of a large church in a prominent position on the slopes of Edge Hill. The  Grade II* listed building was designed by Frederick Walters, a young architect, who designed it in the late Decorated Gothic style.", "The nave of the newly built church opened on 17 June, the feast of the Sacred Heart, in 1887. Construction continued for fourteen years while the rest of the building was completed: first the sanctuary and south aisle in 1895, then the back chapels in 1896, the north aisle and sacristy in 1898, and finally the west front in 1901. The original plan called for a large tower on the west front, but money ran out and it was replaced by twin turrets and a massive, traceried window. A monument on the south wall of the church dedicated to Edith Arendrup is inscribed with the words: \u201cIt was through her Christian vision that this parish of the Sacred Heart came into being; it was through her generosity the church was built.\u201d"]}, {"page": "Arendrup", "response": ["* Edith Arendrup (1846\u20131934), English artist and religious sister"]}, {"page": "St Winefride Church, South Wimbledon", "response": ["In 1877, The Jesuits came to Wimbledon at the request of Edith Arendrup, a member of the Courtauld family, from Roehampton where they had their novitiate, Manresa House.
