George Forrest was the son of Joseph Forrest [died 22 February 1968 aged 81] of Gortagammon, Tullyhogue, Cookstown, County Tyrone.Forrest was first elected in the 1956 Mid Ulster by-election which was called after two previous MPs had been declared ineligible to sit. Initially elected as an independent, Forrest soon joined the Ulster Unionist Party and successfully contested the seat in three general elections. He became a prominent supporter of Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O'Neill's liberal policies and became reviled by many of O'Neill's opponents. In 1967 he was pulled off a Twelfth of July platform in Coagh and kicked unconscious by fellow members of the Orange Order. Following his death in 1968 aged 47, his wife Anna was chosen to take over his candidacy, but the by-election was won by Bernadette Devlin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 10", "response": ["*  1968   \u2013 George Forrest, Northern Irish lawyer and politician (b. 1921)"]}, {"page": "Bernadette Devlin McAliskey", "response": ["She stood unsuccessfully against James Chichester-Clark in the 1969 Northern Ireland general election.
