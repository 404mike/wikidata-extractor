Their first release, the Everythang's Groovy EP, was released in 1986 and produced by Jon Langford; however, the Nosedive Karma EP from 1987, their second release, was \"the group's breakthrough,\" as Jason Ankeny of AllMusic later described it, \"garnering considerable press attention for its use of hip-hop and dance beats \u2013 a major innovation in mid-'80s alternative rock.\" The band and their friends Crazyhead became known as innovators of grebo, a genre which played a crucial role in \"bridging the gap between rock and hip-hop.\"", "Mary Byker, describing Drill Your Own Hole as a \"mish-mash\" of styles, hoped that listeners would \"hear different things each time\" they listen to the album, as a result of the band's varied tastes and influences: \"Personally, when I'm at home just listening to music I listen to Captain Beefheart and lots of stuff really. Tony the guitarist likes Hendrix and Zappa mainly. The bass player likes The Ramones and the drummer likes speed metal thrash bands. We all bring different influences into the band, this is why its so difficult to work sometimes. I mean, you can't put all those things together, it takes a long time to make it fit.\"", "The first 1,000 copies of the LP version of the album were pressed without a hole in the vinyl, with the sleeve instructing listeners to \"drill your own hole\" in the vinyl so that they could play it. Lead vocalist Mary Byker later reflected: \"There was about a thousand of them. There was a sticker on the front saying that it was a limited edition. I don't even have a copy; I wish I did! We could see the headlines: 'Kid Goes Crazy with Power Drill to Play Record.' Well, that's what we were hoping, anyway!\" This version of the album later featured in Radio X's 2015 list of \"great record sales gimmicks.\" In 2016, pop band Some Jerks similarly included the album in their list of \"five unique merch items any diehard fan would want, surely.\" Levi Fuller of KEXP-FM related this edition to the band's playfulness:", "The album was accompanied by a 60-minute film, also titled Drill Your Own Hole and made with the help of Lowry who designed the cover. According to the Leicester Mercury, \"the film, if anything, was even more mystifying\" than the unusual vinyl edition of the album. Mary Byker later told B-Side Magazine: \"The album is the soundtrack. It's a parody of us, the music industry and what we've let ourselves in for. We had the money at the time so we decided to go for it.\" The band's bass player Robber Byker, speaking about the film in 2013, said: \"I can\u2019t tell you what the film is about, and I was in it,\" and commented that although the film was understood by several people, \"I think that tells you more about them than it does about the film.\" It was released on VHS by Virgin Music Video.", "Only a year later, Mary Byker expressed dissatisfaction with the drum sound on the album, telling American publication B-Side: \"They're not at all like how he plays live. We had to put them down on an electric click track machine because they're in the movie. Having said that though, I listened to it the other day and it really didn't sound that bad. When I'm here, it sounds like a section of it is different. American people seem to like it because the album is more popular here than it was in England.\" The Leicester Mercury said the album \"was full of good ideas and original music, but ruined by a terrible \u201980s production: big drum sounds and everything smothered in multiple layers of unnecessary reverb.\" Robber himself told the newspaper in 2013 that \"I find it hard to listen to now.\" He later reflected that the era of the album's release brought the band several troubles, mostly concerning bills and money, after the band came under new management:"]}, {"page": "Byker (surname)", "response": ["*Mary Byker (born 1963), English singer, record producer, and DJ"]}]}}
