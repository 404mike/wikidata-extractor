He befriended Elton John when the British singer was staying in California in 1972, insisting on calling him \"John Elton\". According to writer Philip Norman, when Marx jokingly pointed his index fingers as if holding a pair of six-shooters, Elton John put up his hands and said, \"Don't shoot me, I'm only the piano player,\" thereby naming the album he had just completed. A film poster for the Marx Bros. movie Go West is visible on the album cover photograph as an homage to Marx. Elton John accompanied Marx to a performance of Jesus Christ Superstar.

Epstein was homosexual and closeted, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, \"Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf\u00e9 in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this.\" Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying \"How was your honeymoon, John?\" The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple: \"He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in.\""]}, {"page": "Mick Jagger", "response": ["In the words of British dramatist and novelist Philip Norman, \"the only point concerning Mick Jagger's influence over 'young people' that doctors and psychologists agreed on was that it wasn't, under any circumstances, fundamentally harmless\".Philip Norman, Symphony for the Devil: the Rolling Stones Story, p.173. Linden Press/Simon & Schuster, 1984. According to Norman, even Elvis Presley at his most scandalous had not exerted a \"power so wholly and disturbingly physical\". \"[W]hile [Presley] made girls scream, [he] did not have Jagger's ability to make men feel uncomfortable.\" Norman likens Jagger in his early performances with the Rolling Stones in the 1960s to a male ballet dancer, with \"his conflicting and colliding sexuality: the swan's neck and smeared harlot eyes allied to an overstuffed and straining codpiece\"."]}, {"page": "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "response": ["Portions of Sgt. Pepper reflect the Beatles' general immersion in the blues, Motown and other American popular musical traditions. The author Ian MacDonald writes that when reviewing their rivals' recent work in late 1966, the Beatles identified the most significant LP as the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, which Brian Wilson, the band's leader, had created in response to the Beatles' Rubber Soul. McCartney was highly impressed with the \"harmonic structures\" and choice of instruments used on Pet Sounds, and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could \"get further out\" than the Beach Boys had. He identified Pet Sounds as his main musical inspiration for Sgt. Pepper, adding that \"[we] nicked a few ideas\", although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking. Freak Out! by the Mothers of Invention has also been cited as having influenced Sgt. Pepper. According to the biographer Philip Norman, during the recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: \"This is our Freak Out!\" The music journalist Chet Flippo stated that McCartney was inspired to record a concept album after hearing Freak Out!"]}, {"page": "Rubber Soul", "response": ["Lennon recalled that Rubber Soul was the first album over which the Beatles had complete creative control, with enough studio time to develop and refine new sound ideas. According to Riley, the album reflects \"a new affection for recording\" over live performance. Author Philip Norman similarly writes that, with the Beatles increasingly drawn towards EMI's large cache of \"exotic\" musical instruments, and the band's readiness to incorporate \"every possible resource of the studio itself\" as well as Martin's skills as a classical arranger, \"Implicitly, from the very start, this [music] was not stuff intended to be played live on stage.\""]}, {"page": "The Beatles (album)", "response": ["Peter Doggett writes that \"the most essential line of communication\" had been broken between Lennon and McCartney by Ono's presence on the first day of recording. Beatles biographer Philip Norman comments that the two shared a disregard for the other's new compositions; Lennon found McCartney's songs \"cloyingly sweet and bland\", while McCartney viewed Lennon's as \"harsh, unmelodious and deliberately provocative\". Harrison and Starr chose to distance themselves partway through the project, flying to California on 7 June so that Harrison could film his scenes for the Ravi Shankar documentary Raga. Lennon's, McCartney's and Harrison's individual projects outside the band in 1968 were further evidence of the group's fragmentation. In Lennon's case, the album cover of his experimental collaboration with Ono Two Virgins featured the couple completely naked, a gesture his bandmates found bewildering and unnecessary."]}, {"page": "Brian Jones", "response": ["Theories surrounding Jones's death developed soon afterwards, with associates of the Stones claiming to have information that he was murdered. According to rock biographer Philip Norman, \"the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so\". In 1993, it was reported that Jones was murdered by Frank Thorogood, a builder who was doing construction work on the property. He was the last person to see Jones alive. Thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the Rolling Stones' driver Tom Keylock, who later denied this. The Thorogood theory was dramatised in the 2005 film Stoned. Thorogood is alleged to have killed Jones in a fight over money; he had been paid \u00a318,000 for work on Cotchford Farm but he wanted another \u00a36,000 from the musician. The killing is alleged to have been covered up by senior police officers when they discovered how badly the investigation into Jones's death had been botched by the local police."]}, {"page": "Stu Sutcliffe", "response": ["Sutcliffe was born at the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion in Edinburgh, Scotland, and after his family moved to England, he was brought up at 37 Aigburth Drive in Liverpool.

When Sutcliffe's father returned home on leave, he invited his son and art college classmate Rod Murray (also Sutcliffe's housemate and best friend), for a \"real good booze-up\", slipping \u00a310 into Sutcliffe's pocket before disappearing for another six months. Beatles' biographer Philip Norman, wrote that Charles Sutcliffe was a heavy drinker and physically cruel to his wife, which the young Sutcliffe had witnessed."]}, {"page": "A Day in the Life", "response": ["In his appraisal of the song, musicologist Walter Everett states that, as on the band's Revolver album, \"the most monumental piece on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was Lennon's\". He identifies the track's most striking feature as \"its mysterious and poetic approach to serious topics that come together in a larger, direct message to its listeners, an embodiment of the central ideal for which the Beatles stood: that a truly meaningful life can be had only when one is aware of one's self and one's surroundings and overcomes the status quo.\" Beatles biographer Philip Norman describes \"A Day in the Life\" as a \"masterpiece\" and cites it as an example of how Sgt. Pepper \"certainly was John's Freak Out!\", referring to the 1966 album by the Mothers of Invention. As the closing track on Sgt. Pepper, the song was the object of intense scrutiny and commentary. In Ian MacDonald's description, it has been interpreted \"as a sober return to the real world after the drunken fantasy of 'Pepperland'; as a conceptual statement about the structure of the pop album (or the artifice of the studio, or the falsity of recorded performance); as an evocation of a bad [LSD] trip; as a 'pop Waste Land; even as a morbid celebration of death\"."]}, {"page": "Hey Jude", "response": ["Author Philip Norman comments that aside from \"Sour Milk Sea\", which Harrison wrote and produced, the first Apple A-sides were all \"either written, vocalised, discovered or produced\" by McCartney. Lennon wanted \"Revolution\" to be the A-side of the Beatles single, but his bandmates opted for \"Hey Jude\". In his 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, he said \"Hey Jude\" was worthy of an A-side, \"but we could have had both.\" In 1980, he told Playboy he still disagreed with the decision."]}, {"page": "Linda McCartney", "response": ["Biographer Philip Norman observed that Linda had some personality aspects which Paul admired.

Paul McCartney explained that the term \"Norwegian Wood\" was an ironic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue in London. McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: \"In our world the guy had to have some sort of revenge.

English and Scottish promoters were wary of Orbison as a draw; he was not conventionally attractive or animated while performing, and they wondered if audiences would walk out. The tour sold out in one afternoon, however. Orbison's first meeting with John Lennon was awkward because Orbison was overwhelmed with the amount of advertising devoted to the Beatles when it was he who was supposed to headline the show. Beatlemania, however, was taking hold and Orbison accepted that he was not quite the main draw, so he decided to go first on stage.Clayson, p. 110.
