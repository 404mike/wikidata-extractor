In late June, Romanov confirmed that Webster, as well as teammate Rudi Sk\u00e1cel, were in talks to agree a move to Southampton. Days later, Romanov reported the pair to FIFA after the players failed to turn up at the airport to fly to Austria for pre-season training. Later in the month, Webster invoked a new ruling in the FIFA laws which allowed players to free themselves from their contract and join a club in another country, providing they were in the third year of a four-year contract and gave his current club due notice, and was set to sign for Wigan Athletic. In September, the transfer was finally ratified by FIFA. despite a late attempt by Hearts to re-sign Webster. However, after playing just five matches for Wigan, he moved to Rangers on loan in January 2007 and was given permission to play following a complaint by Hearts. In May 2007, the tribunal to decide the compensation due to Hearts took place, with Hearts seeking up to \u00a35\u00a0million, but were eventually rewarded just \u00a3625,000. Scottish Professional Footballers' Association Fraser Wishart described the ruling as a \"landmark\". In January 2008, after an appeal, the compensation fee was reduced to \u00a3150,000 by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In 2007, Matuzal\u00e9m invoked the same clause as Webster to break out of his contract with Shakhtar Donetsk, signing for Real Zaragoza. Matuzal\u00e9m was found to be in breach of contract, and he and Zaragoza were ordered to pay \u00a311\u00a0million in compensation to Shakhtar."]}, {"page": "PFA Scotland", "response": ["The Professional Footballers' Association Scotland (PFA Scotland) is the association for professional footballers in Scotland.
