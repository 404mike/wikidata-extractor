He played football for North-Eastern League club Wallsend before joining Darlington of the Football League Third Division North in 1931.

Darlington won 2\u20130, Grieve scored both goals, and he caught the eye of the Lancashire Evening Post by his \"pushfulness and sense of leadership\". Wellock resumed his place after two matches out, but when Grieve was brought in for an FA Cup tie against Carlisle in December, this time alongside Wellock, who moved to inside right to accommodate Grieve at centre forward, he scored again, and scored another in the next league match."]}, {"page": "Jack Hill (footballer, born 1908)", "response": ["On the same day, Darlington signed Peterborough & Fletton United's Maurice Wellock, whose goal record, of 71 goals from 104 league matches over three seasons, illustrates why he was preferred to Hill at centre-forward. Hill played infrequently, either in the absence of Wellock or with Wellock alongside him at inside forward, and scored 14 goals from 22 league appearances over two seasons, which included two hat-tricks. The first was against South Shields in an 8\u20133 victory, and the second came in the first half of a 5\u20132 defeat of York City, though the Yorkshire Post reported that the first of the three goals failed to cross the line and the third was offside. As he had been with Newport, he was prolific at reserve-team level, but at the end of the 1930\u201331 season, he was given a free transfer, and he signed for North-Eastern League club West Stanley."]}, {"page": "Paddy Wrightson", "response": ["By January 1927, Wrightson was playing as an amateur for Northern League club Ferryhill Athletic. In the summer of 1928, he became one of several hundred Durham amateur footballers suspended for six months and declared professional for receiving payments over and above legitimate expenses. He played as an amateur for Darlington in the latter half of the 1928\u201329 season, and made his debut in the Football League Third Division North on 30 March 1929 in a 3\u20132 defeat at home to Stockport County. He appeared twice more that season, without scoring, and then turned professional. He appeared in the first 33 matches of the 1929\u201330 season and scored 16 goals, playing mainly at inside right in support of 34-goal centre-forward Maurice Wellock as Darlington headed for a third-place finish.Tweddle, The Definitive Darlington, p.\u00a031."]}, {"page": "John Daglish", "response": ["Daglish made his debut at right half in the opening fixture of the season, on 30 August 1930 at home to Wigan Borough, a 3\u20132 defeat after which he lost his place to Fred Hopkinson and was restricted to reserve-team football in the North-Eastern League for a couple of months. In October, he was selected for the Rest of the North-Eastern League in the annual fixture against the reigning champions, who this year were Middlesbrough's reserves. Dalglish returned to Darlington's first team in November for a run of seven matches playing at centre half. He scored his first Football League goal in the last of the seven, at home to Stockport County: he passed to Maurice Wellock who lost the ball, but Daglish recovered it to \"easily beat\" Stockport's goalkeeper. However, a missed penalty by Dickson and what the Athletic News reported as \"serious defensive lapses\" contributed to a 3\u20132 defeat. Daglish made no more first-team appearances during 1930\u201331, and although he remained on their books for a further two seasons, played only rarely as cover, twice in 1931\u201332 and seven times in 1932\u201333, when he was sometimes used at full back."]}]}}
