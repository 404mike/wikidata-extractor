An army officer in early life, he then had an academic career in geology and biology. He became one of the most able and prolific nineteenth century naturalists of New Zealand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Frederick Hutton (1835\u20131905), English biologist and geologist who used natural selection to explain the natural history of New Zealand"]}, {"page": "Antarctic minke whale", "response": ["In February 1867, a fisherman found an estimated  male rorqual floating in the R\u00edo de la Plata near Belgrano, about ten miles from Buenos Aires, Argentina. After bringing it ashore he brought it to the attention of the German Argentine zoologist Hermann Burmeister, who described it as a new species, Balaenoptera bonaerensis, the same year.Burmeister, H.

The skeleton of another specimen, a  individual taken off Otago Head, South Island, New Zealand, in October 1873, was sent by Professor Frederick Hutton, keeper of the Otago Museum in Dunedin, to the British Museum in London, where it was examined by the British zoologist John Edward Gray, who described it as a new species of \"pike whale\" (minke whale, B. acutorostrata) and named it B. huttoni. Both descriptions were largely ignored for a century."]}, {"page": "James Hector", "response": ["Hector retired in 1903, after four decades at the centre of organised science in New Zealand.

In August 1892, Forbes permanently moved to England, and Hutton was appointed full director from May 1892 until October 1905. Hutton applied for leave to travel to England, and Charles Chilton was acting director from March 1905; Hutton died on his return journey from England and Chilton retained his acting role until April 1906, when Edgar Ravenswood Waite received a permanent appointment.

He published his account in an 1875 issue of the scientific journal Annals and Magazine of Natural History, in which he named the new species Trygon brevicaudata, derived from the Latin brevis (\"short\") and cauda (\"tail\"). Although long assigned to Dasyatis, recent work by Last et al. (2016) resurrected Bathytoshia for it and the broad stingray, as well as the roughtail stingray.Last, P.R., G.J. P. Naylor and B.M.

The short-tail stingray may also be referred to as giant black ray, giant stingray, New Zealand short-tail stingaree, Schreiners ray, short-tailed stingaree, shorttail black stingray, and smooth short-tailed stingray. It is closely related to the similar-looking but smaller pitted stingray (Dasyatis matsubarai) of the northwestern Pacific."]}, {"page": "Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science", "response": ["* 9th Meeting ...
