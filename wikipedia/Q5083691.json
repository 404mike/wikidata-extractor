Although technically a heavy cruiser because of the calibre of her guns, Exeter was a scaled-down version of the County-class. The force was commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood whose flagship was Ajax, captained by Charles Woodhouse. Achilles was on loan to the New Zealand Division (precursor to the Royal New Zealand Navy) and captained by Edward Parry. Exeter was commanded by Captain Frederick Secker Bell. During the period before and at the immediate time of the battle, Cumberland (commanded by Captain Walter Herman Gordon Fallowfield) was refitting in the Falkland Islands but was available for sea at short notice. Force G was supported by the oilers RFAux Olna, RFAux Olynthus, and RFAux Orangeleaf. Olynthus replenished HMS Ajax and Achilles on 22 November 1939, and Exeter on 26 November, at San Borombon Bay. Olynthus was also directed to keep observation between Medanos and Cape San Antonio, off Argentina south of the River Plate estuary (see chart below)."]}, {"page": "The Battle of the River Plate (film)", "response": ["* Ian Hunter as Captain Charles Woodhouse, HMS Ajax"]}, {"page": "Ian Hunter (actor)", "response": ["* The Battle of the River Plate aka Pursuit of the Graf Spee (1956) as Captain Charles Woodhouse - HMS Ajax"]}, {"page": "East Indies Station", "response": ["|37 ||Vice-Admiral || 25px ||Sir Charles Woodhouse|||(1948\u20131950)"]}, {"page": "Edward Clark (conductor)", "response": ["On 20 April 1921 Arthur Bliss's Conversations for string quartet had its world premiere at a Clark concert.
