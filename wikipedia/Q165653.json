It seems likely that any trace of this village was washed away by later goldminers and their sluicing activities. The English translation of 'Orepuki' has been subject to numerous theories: Aro-puke or 'crumbling cliffs' being one of the more popular suggestions. In 1923, Henry P. Young, the former headmaster of Orepuki School, said in a talk to the Southland Branch of the N.Z. Society, published in the Southland Times, \"the proper name is \"Aropaki\" and means a bright area or expanse.\" In Ng\u0101 Ingoa o Aotearoa: an oral dictionary of M\u0101ori placenames, recorded in 1992, local  (tribal elder) George Te Au offers as pronunciations both Ore-PUki and \u014d-R\u0100paki.Ng\u0101 Ingoa o Aotearoa: an oral dictionary of M\u0101ori placenames, Track 167, Western Southland http://ingoa.nz/old/all-tks/167.wma"]}, {"page": "History of the Otago Region", "response": ["In the ensuing peace even the \"unpredictably ferocious\" Otago harbour M\u0101ori modified their behaviour in the interests of trade. Their kin at Ruapuke not only held their traditional monopoly over the sooty shearwaters, or New Zealand muttonbirds, but had effectively monopolised te tongata bulla and its wealth. Some 15 to 20 Europeans, many of them with M\u0101ori wives, lived on Codfish Island although they moved freely among the M\u0101ori kaiks on the mainland. These Europeans complied with M\u0101ori customs for fear of triggering that much-feared \"touchiness\". The Journal of John Boultbee,", "Boultbee did not understand the \"strange custom of tabooing\", but he recognised that \"any willful breach of it considered a serious matter, & in severe cases punishable by death\". The security of the intruders depended upon the goodwill of the paramount rangatira in Murihiku, Te Whakataupuka. The son of Honegai, who had harried the Tongata Bulla wherever he could, Te Whakataupuka proved less truculent and more skilful in manipulating the new arrivals. He became the first to recognise the strategic importance of Ruapuke: he shifted from the mouth of the Matua-a to make his home on the island. Te Whakataupuka impressed John Boultbee as \"the most complete model of strength, activity & elegance I had seen combined in any man\". He placed the Europeans under his chiefly protection and at times played and joked with them freely. Limits existed to this familiarity. Once, when a group of P\u0101keh\u0101 engaged in a mock battle with the chief, one accidentally hit his head with a potato (the head of the chief being tapu). This \"excited him suddenly & caused him to seize a tremendous log of wood, which he threw at them....\" Cooling quickly, he told them to desist lest he should \"perhaps get vexed & hurt them, which he would be sorry to do\". When Te Whakataupuka's son, who preferred to live with the Europeans, died, Boultbee and his companions feared that Te Whakataupuka might hold them responsible for the boy's death. Despite his grief the rangatira refused to allow his warriors to exact revenge."]}, {"page": "Thomas Pownall Boultbee", "response": ["Boultbee was the eldest son of Thomas Boultbee, for forty-seven years Vicar of Bidford, Warwickshire, was born on 7 Aug. 1818.
