The five years of glory commenced with the release of Ian Whitehead from Berwick Rangers in 1973, Chalky as he was universally known was snapped up by Selkirk and became player/manager later in the season. Whitehead became the architect of the most fruitful period of success in the club's history and soon bagged the first trophy in 28 years for Selkirk FC.", "Throughout this period Selkirk had the services of many of the finest players in the Scottish Borders and frequently fielded four Amateur Scottish Caps in the side Ian Whitehead, Sandy Bell, Moray McLaren and Davie Watkins.", "Like all good things however, Selkirk's Golden Era came to an end when Ian Whitehead was enticed back into Scottish League Football as a coach with Second Division Berwick Rangers.
