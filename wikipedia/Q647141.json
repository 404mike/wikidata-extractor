It was first described by English zoologist Robert Fisher Tomes as Hyracodon fuliginosus in 1863. It was given its present binomial name by English zoologist Oldfield Thomas in 1895. In the latter part of 20th century, scientists believed that Caenolestes is closely related to Lestoros (the Incan caenolestid). Over the years, it became clear that Lestoros is morphologically different from Caenolestes. A 2013 morphological and mitochondrial DNA-based phylogenetic study showed that the Incan caenolestid and the long-nosed caenolestid (Rhyncholestes raphanurus) form a clade sister to Caenolestes. The cladogram below is based on this study."]}, {"page": "Gould's long-eared bat", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Robert Fisher Tomes"]}, {"page": "Tomes's sword-nosed bat", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Robert Fisher Tomes"]}, {"page": "Oecomys bicolor", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Robert Fisher Tomes"]}, {"page": "Tomes", "response": ["* Robert Fisher Tomes (1823\u20131904), English zoologist"]}, {"page": "Lonchorhina", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Robert Fisher Tomes"]}, {"page": "Weston-on-Avon", "response": ["* Robert Fisher Tomes, English farmer and zoologist, was born here on 4 August 1823."]}, {"page": "Rusty pipistrelle", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Robert Fisher Tomes"]}, {"page": "Variegated butterfly bat", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Robert Fisher Tomes"]}, {"page": "Southeastern long-eared bat", "response": ["The description emerged from a taxonomic revision of the species Nyctophilus timoriensis, known as the greater long-eared bats of genus Nyctophilus.
