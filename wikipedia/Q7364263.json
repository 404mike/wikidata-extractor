At the inaugural IAAF World Cup in Athletics, he commenced a \"kick\" with 200m to go, running the final turn in 11.8 s and the last 200m in 25.1 s.

As they approached the finish line, Fielding pulled onto Pruitt's shoulder, then leaned as the two crossed the line together.  Without photo-finish equipment the result had to be called from hand-timing only. Fielding was given a time of 9.97 seconds; Pruitt had officially run 9.96. Fielding believed he had won, as did the BBC commentators covering the final. Fielding's challenge was teetering, and in the half-mile run the searing Caribbean heat and a crazy pace he had attempted to catch up with Budd cost him physically; he collapsed of heat exhaustion and had to receive first aid and oxygen from Ron Pickering at track-side."]}, {"page": "Cotswold Olimpick Games", "response": ["The British Olympic Association, in its successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, recognised Dover's games as \"the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings\".
