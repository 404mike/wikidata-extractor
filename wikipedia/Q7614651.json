Shortly before the 2006\u201307 campaign, on 8 August 2006, Madjo joined newly promoted Conference National side Stafford Rangers. He was the first ever full-time player at Stafford Rangers. Madjo made his debut four days later in a 1\u20131 draw away at Grays Athletic. He scored the winning goal in the club's following fixture, a 1\u20130 home win against Altrincham \u2013 firing the ball high into the net in the 81st minute after connecting with Dolapo Olaoye's cross. Madjo failed to find the net again until 10 October 2006, scoring in Stafford's 4\u20131 away win at Gravesend & Northfleet. Four days later, he was on hand to score the only goal of the game in the 8th minute in a 1\u20130 win victory against Woking, scoring from 18 yards out. A month later, Madjo scored his fourth goal of the 2006\u201307 campaign in a 3\u20131 defeat at Halifax Town, before scoring a week later in a 2\u20132 home draw against St Albans City. Madjo failed to find the scoresheet for two months, before scoring a consolation strike in a 3\u20131 home loss to Morecambe on 27 January 2007, with the visitors 3\u20130 up Madjo struck a \"superb 20-yard volley\" past Morecambe goalkeeper Steven Drench. He went a further nine games without a goal, ending his goal drought in a 4\u20132 win against Grays Athletic on 24 March 2007. Three days later, he scored a crucial winner in a 1\u20130 away win at Altrincham, scoring with a header from Nathan Talbott's driven cross. A brace away at Aldershot Town in a 4\u20132 defeat meant that Madjo had taken his goal tally into double figures, scoring two first-half goals with close range finishes. Madjo scored both goals in Stafford's 2\u20130 home win against Northwich Victoria on 17 April 2007, the win all but secured Stafford's Conference National status for another season. He scored 12 times for Stafford in 45 appearances."]}, {"page": "Clayton Donaldson", "response": ["Donaldson returned from his suspension for York's reserves against Sheffield United on 6 February 2007, but the match was frozen off, and he eventually returned in a 4\u20130 away win over Altrincham on 10 February 2007. His first goals since his suspension came against Cambridge United, with a hat-trick on 13 March 2007. Donaldson insisted he remained fully committed to York, after speculation concerning his commitment grew in April 2007. In the play-off semi-final second leg away to Morecambe on 7 May 2007, Donaldson collided with the onrushing opposition goalkeeper Steven Drench in the penalty area while trying to collect the ball. With Donaldson still groggy, York's penalty was taken by Steve Bowey, who successfully converted in the 20th minute. However, York lost the match 2\u20131 and were eliminated on aggregate. Donaldson finished 2006\u201307 with 26 goals for York from 48 appearances, including 24 goals in the Conference National, meaning he was the division's third top scorer."]}, {"page": "Chris Neal", "response": ["Neal had to wait until September 2006 for another loan move, as he spent one month at Gary Peters' League Two club Shrewsbury Town, providing cover for Chris Mackenzie after an injury to Ryan Esson. Neal appeared on the Shrewsbury bench for six league matches but did not make it onto the pitch at Gay Meadow, though he did play the full 90 minutes of the League Trophy match at Hereford United. At the end of the season he was signed by Morecambe as an emergency loan after the club's regular custodian Steven Drench dislocated an elbow, leaving manager Sammy McIlroy to choose between Davies and Neal for the 2007 Conference National play-off Final at Wembley. Despite being awarded a winners medal he did not spend any time on the pitch for the Lancashire club as the club's rookie goalkeeper, Scott Davies, proved up to the task of keeping goal in the club's successful promotion bid. Neal did not make a senior appearance in 2007\u201308 or 2008\u201309 under either Paul Simpson or Alan Irvine. During this time he shook off a bout of conjunctivitis."]}, {"page": "Scott Davies (footballer, born 1987)", "response": ["On 7 May 2007, during Morecambe's Conference National play-off semi-final second leg match at home to York City, fellow Morecambe goalkeeper Steven Drench fouled York City's Clayton Donaldson in the 19th minute and conceded a penalty kick, Drench also suffered a major injury during this collision and Davies was forced to come to face the penalty, which Steve Bowey converted, leaving Morecambe 1\u20130 down on aggregate, but two goals from Wayne Curtis put Morcambe through to the final, winning 2\u20131 on aggregate. Drench was ruled out of the Final, so Sammy McIlroy signed Preston North End goalkeeper Chris Neal on a short-term loan to provide cover and competition for Davies."]}, {"page": "Ryan Robinson (footballer)", "response": ["Robinson moved near to his family home when he joined Morecambe. He quickly made the goalkeeper jersey his own through a series of excellent displays. However, after being injured Morecambe brought in loan keeper Steven Drench from nearby Blackburn Rovers. Drench similarly excelled and took Robinson's first-team spot."]}, {"page": "Drench", "response": ["* Steven Drench (born 1985), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Aaron Williams (footballer)", "response": ["Williams scored to put Rushall Olympic 1\u20130 up against Conference North side Guiseley in the Third Qualifying Round of the FA Trophy on 2 December 2014.
