He played as a wing half.\nWarhurst was born in Handsworth, Sheffield. He began his football career during the Second World War as a youth with Atlas & Norfolk Works before signing as an as an amateur with Huddersfield Town and Sheffield United, and turned professional with the latter in September 1944. His early career was as a winger, but after he joined Birmingham City for an \u00a38,000 fee in 1950, he was converted to wing half. His forceful style contributed much to the club's Second Division title in the 1954\u201355 season and to their performances in the First Division and the FA Cup the following season. Warhurst injured a thigh in the sixth-round FA Cup match, and missed the rest of the season, and his absence was considered a significant factor in Birmingham's losing the 1956 Cup Final: teammate Alex Govan was convinced that \"if Roy Warhurst had been fit then there would only have been one winner\".He succeeded Len Boyd as Birmingham captain at the end of that season, and 12 months later signed for Manchester City for a \u00a310,000 fee. He spent 18 months at City before moving on to Crewe Alexandra and then to Oldham Athletic, where he was appointed captain. A spell in non-league football with Banbury Spencer preceded his retirement from the game in 1964.Warhurst went on to become a scrap metal dealer. He was married to Jean and had three children. He died in January 2014 at the age of 87.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1956 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Semi-final opponents Sunderland found Birmingham without \"hard-man\" left-half Roy Warhurst, who had injured a thigh against Arsenal, but in Jack Badham they had an effective replacement. The club's official history describes this as \"probably the finest team performance against top class opposition ever produced\" by a Birmingham team. They attacked from the kick-off and nullified Sunderland's pressure and the threat of Len Shackleton. Noel Kinsey scored early and the second goal came from a passing move down the left side finished by Astall. As Sunderland threw everyone forward, which left them open at the back, Brown picked up a long through ball and lobbed the goalkeeper. Astall said afterwards that he was surprised they had not scored five,Matthews, Complete Record, p.\u00a028. and Brown wrote in his newspaper column:", "Birmingham also had doubts over their selection. Captain Len Boyd had for some time been suffering from a debilitating back problem, and relied on injections to keep him playing.

Fellow wing half Roy Warhurst had injured his thigh in the sixth-round match and played no further part in the season, while Badham, who damaged an ankle three weeks before the final, travelled on the Thursday with the rest of the team to their base in Twyford, Berkshire. Jeff Hall was struggling with a virus.Matthews, The Legends of Birmingham City, p.\u00a077. When manager Turner announced his team on the eve of the match, Boyd took Warhurst's position at left-half, Badham, who had proved an able deputy in the semi-final, was omitted, and the inexperienced 22-year-old Johnny Newman came in on the right.Matthews, Complete Record, p.\u00a0114.", "Though the thousands gathered outside the Council House roared \"No!\" when Boyd said the team felt they had let the supporters down, there were recriminations concerning Birmingham's performance and team selection. The local press suggested that attempts to combat \"Wembley nerves\" had resulted in an \"over-casual approach to the game\". The row at half-time had done little for second-half morale, but speaking fifty years later, Gil Merrick placed the blame less on Boyd's questionable fitness than on a failure to discuss how to stop Revie. Alex Govan, convinced that \"if Roy Warhurst had been fit then there would only have been one winner\", blamed \"bad team selection\", saying that even without Warhurst he firmly believed \"that if Badham had been in we would have won that game. He would never have given Don Revie the room to run the match.\"Lewis (ed.), Keeping right on since 1875, p.\u00a063.

Others took part in significant matches in club history. Billy Ollis, Jenkyns, Ted Devey, Jack Hallam, Wheldon and Tommy Hands appeared in Small Heath's first Football League match in 1892. Eight men listed here played in Birmingham's pioneering venture into club football in Europe in the 1955\u201358 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and ten played on the losing side in the 1956 FA Cup Final (an eleventh, Roy Warhurst, missed the match through injury). In more recent times, Paul Tait scored the first golden goal to decide a Wembley cup final, against Carlisle United in the 1995 Football League Trophy. Geoff Horsfield scored the extra-time equaliser that took the 2002 First Division play-off final into a shootout; Paul Devlin and Stan Lazaridis converted their spot-kicks as Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time. Seven men listed here, including captain Stephen Carr and goalscorer Nikola \u017digi\u0107, took the field as Birmingham won the 2011 League Cup; another two were unused substitutes.

Under the management of Arthur Turner, they won promotion to the First Division in 1954\u201355, reached the FA Cup Final and achieved their highest ever finishing position (sixth place) the following season, and then the FA Cup semifinal in 1957, only to lose to Manchester United's \"Busby Babes\". They went on to play on the losing side in two successive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup finals, under Smith's captaincy.

With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not fully match-fit, Birmingham's strength and balance was disrupted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Manchester City's unconventional style of play, known as the \"Revie Plan\". At half-time, a row erupted between the manager and some of the players, Boyd included, about their fitness; in the second half, whether due to physical and mental exhaustion or the effects of the row, Birmingham were soundly beaten.'Manchester's New Triumph', The Times, \"Their spirit and iron determination, whatever the signs might have been, were two qualities not to be lightly disregarded. But having patched up the scar of that shattering opening blow, drawn level at the quarter-hour, and then immediately taken control for a period of 20 minutes, they dissipated their strength.

Goalkeeper Gil Merrick attributed to the defeat to a half-time failure to discuss how to stop Revie, and outside left Alex Govan blamed the absence of the \"utterly ruthless\" Roy Warhurst through injury and a poor choice of replacement.Lewis (ed.)
