A play's narrative is driven by dialogue. Like novelists, playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances. As writers, playwrights must make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole. Since most plays are performed, rather than read privately, the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience's attention over the period of the performance. Plays tell \"a story the audience should care about\", so writers have to cut anything that worked against that. Plays may be written in prose or verse.

Some of them came in blank verse or iambic pentameter and endeavour to be in conversation with Shakespeare's writing styles.  King Charles III by Mike Bartlett, written in iambic pentameter, played on the West End and Broadway, as well as being filmed with the original cast for the BBC.  Likewise, La Bete by David Hirson, which endeavours to recreate Moliere's farces in rhyming couplets, enjoyed several prominent productions on both sides of the Atlantic. David Ives, known best for his short, absurdist work, has turned to \"transladaptation\" (his word) in his later years: translating and updating French farces, such as The School for Lies and The Metromaniacs, both of which premiered in New York City. With the renewed interest in verse drama, theatre companies are looking for \"new Shakespeare\" plays to produce.  Companies such as Red Bull Theater in New York City (named after the historical theatre of the same name) specializes in producing Ives' \"transladaptations\" as well as obscure verse plays.  Turn to Flesh Productions, a New York City theatre company founded by verse drama specialist, Emily C. A. Snyder, directly develops new verse plays with living playwrights, with a mission to create vibrant roles for women and those underrepresented in classical art.  In 2017, the American Shakespeare Center founded Shakespeare's New Contemporaries (SNC), which solicits new plays in conversation with Shakespeare's canon.  This was partially in response to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival commissioning \"modern English\" versions of Shakespeare plays."]}, {"page": "Suranne Jones", "response": ["In September 2017, the second series of Doctor Foster premiered, garnering positive critical reception.
