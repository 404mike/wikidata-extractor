Trained under Jesse Ramsden, he produced numerous scientific instruments including mechanical calculators, measuring instruments, telescopes, microscopes, navigation and survey equipment.\nWilliam Cary was born to George and Mary Cary. He had three brothers, the eldest George (ca. 1753-1830) was a haberdasher while the second brother John, was a mapmaker who also worked with William and the last, Francis (ca. 1756-1836) was an engraver. Cary learnt the skills for producing instruments as an apprentice of Jesse Ramsden (1735-1800).\nThe instruments made by William Cary were used around the world including Russia and India. He also made instruments for the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. After his death in 1825, the firm was taken over by Charles Gould who may have trained briefly under William Cary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jesse Ramsden", "response": ["Ramsden's health began to fail and he traveled to Brighton on the south coast to try to benefit from its better climate, but died there on 5 November 1800. He was buried at St James's Church, Piccadilly on 13 November. His instrument-making business in London was taken over by his foreman, Matthew Berge until his death in 1819. The estate passed on to his son. Many of Ramsden's apprentices such as William Cary went on to establish their own instrument-making ventures. Others like Edward Troughton incorporated ideas from Ramsden into their own designs."]}, {"page": "Ramsden surveying instruments", "response": ["Ramsden himself constructed three theodolites and a further two were completed to his design by Mathew Berge, his son-in-law and business successor, after Ramsden's death in 1805. Of the other instruments one was constructed by William Cary and the other two by the firm of Troughton and Simms.", "Although the East India company turned down Ramsden's second theodolite they commissioned a similar design from another London instrument maker, William Cary. This theodolite was in use in India from 1802 although there was a slight hiatus in 1808 when it was damaged when being hauled to the top of a building. It was repaired and in use for sixty years. A new theodolite to an improved design was made for the Indian Survey by Troughton and Simms in 1830 and the two together saw service until 1874 when the Cary instrument was replaced by another by Troughton and Sims. This last instrument was a monster weighing  when in its travelling cases: it was no surprise that it was deemed too heavy for transport up mountains and it passed to South Africa in 1882. No more great instruments were made after 1874 for continuing advances in precision instruments eclipsed their performance: by the end of the nineteenth century an accuracy of 1 arc second could be obtained with a  instrument.

This was very similar to the instruments used in France and Britain for previous trigonometrical surveys. It had a horizontal circle that was 36 inches wide and the readings were taken using a microscope. The vertical graduated circle was 18 inches in diameter. It weighed about half a ton and needed twelve men to carry it. Lambton measured all three angles of triangles in several cases to establish the spherical excess (angles of triangles on a sphere sum up greater than 180\u00b0). When the survey was carried out from Madras to Bangalore, Lambton was able to compare the Bangalore baseline of 1804 with the calculated measurements and the difference was about three and a half inches."]}, {"page": "William Cary", "response": ["William Cary may refer to:", "* William Cary (instrument maker) (1759\u20131825), English maker of scientific instruments", "* William Cary (1437\u20131471), of Cockington and Clovelly in Devon was a member of the Devonshire gentry.
