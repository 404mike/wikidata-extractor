They became known as a collaborative group, \"The Four\", or \"The Glasgow Four\", and were prominent members of the \"Glasgow School\" movement. The group exhibited in Glasgow, London and Vienna, and these exhibitions helped establish Mackintosh's reputation. The so-called \"Glasgow\" style was exhibited in Europe and influenced the Viennese Art Nouveau movement known as Sezessionstil (in English, the Vienna Secession) around 1900.  Mackintosh also worked in interior design, furniture, textiles and metalwork. Much of this work combines Mackintosh's own designs with those of his wife, whose flowing, floral style complemented his more formal, rectilinear work. Blackie commissioned him in the 1920s to work on bindings for their publications. One of these works was an abstract design that was intended for a new uniform of G. A. Henty's novels. It was instead used for Yarns on the Beach by Henty, and for a series entitled The Boys and Girls Bookshelf, c. 1926. Both Newbolt and Floyer speculate that Mackintosh may have designed the cover for another series by Blackie."]}, {"page": "Bonnie Prince Charlie (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Bonnie Prince Charlie: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden, a novel by G.

Tyler was the protagonist of the play Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, or, The Mob Reformers (1730) first performed at Bartholomew Fair in 1730.
