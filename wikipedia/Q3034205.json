After broadcast, Thames commissioned a full series to be shown the following year, under the name The Bill as the show had the potential to appeal to a mass audience. Although The Bill is clearly a continuation from this episode, the main series contradicts it in a number of ways. For instance, in Woodentop Litten has completed his secondment to CID and is close to securing his place in the detective branch, whereas in The Bill he does not gain his CID secondment until halfway through Series One. In addition many central characters in \"Woodentop\" - such as Sergeant Wilding and Inspector Deeping - vanish between the pilot and the series.  Deeping does gain one mention in Series One, in the episode \"It's Not Such a Bad Job After All\", where Ackland is informed that he is coming to meet her on the scene of a suicide - a later radio transmission, however, reports that Sgt. Bob Cryer is to meet her instead.  Although Wilding is not mentioned following Woodentop, he shares several characteristics with Sgt. Cryer - including a position as the \"father figure\" of the Sun Hill relief, and an apparently tumultuous relationship with Roy Galloway, whom both Cryer and Wilding refer to as a \"bloody superstar\".  In the first episode of Series One, \"Funny Ol' Business - Cops and Robbers\", Galloway and Cryer make apparent reference to the events of Woodentop in regards to Jim Carver.  Galloway suggests that it is Cryer who requested the favour, further suggesting that Cryer and Wilding are in fact the one character, and that, like PC Taffy Morgan (later Taffy Edwards), Jack Wilding's name has merely been changed to Bob Cryer. There are also discrepancies with the naming of some of the characters. In the 2003 live episode of The Bill, made to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of broadcast, Carver and Ackland discuss events from the pilot, whereupon Carver incorrectly refers to the character of Taffy by the surname Morgan, a name that was dropped for the series proper in favour of \"Edwards\". There are also mistakes made in some of the uniforms the cast wore during the episode, for example, in one scene, PC Dave Litten is on foot patrol with PC Jim Carver, and PC Litten's helmet has GR on the helmet badge where it should have had ER, the same that was on PC Carver's helmet. Also the tunics the male officers wore had buttoned down epaulettes, whereas they should have just had the insignia placed on the shoulder of the tunic as this is what the Metropolitan Police wore at the time.  Only four of the cast of \"Woodentop\" would go on to be regulars in the main series of The Bill: Mark Wingett, Trudie Goodwin, Gary Olsen and Colin Blumenau, while a number of characters were re-cast, including Roy Galloway.Colin Blumenau", "* WPC June Ackland - Trudie Goodwin"]}, {"page": "Rodney Blackstock", "response": ["Rodney becomes a male escort and does not tell his girlfriend Georgia Sharma (Trudie Goodwin).

It was written by Geoff McQueen, who had previously worked on LWT's The Gentle Touch.

Woodentop was directed by Peter Cregeen, who had played a part in Z-Cars and Juliet Bravo.Thames Television commissioned 12 further episodes for transmission in 1984, which would relaunch under the title of The Bill.", "Under Marquess, The Bill aired grittier and harrowing plots for officers individually including a crack addiction for PC Nick Klein, a male rape for DC Mickey Webb and a cot death for Sergeant Sheelagh Murphy. A trait Marquess succeeded with during his time on the series was casting actors never seen as villains in their careers such as Todd Carty as PC Gabriel Kent and Lynda Bellingham as crime boss Irene Radford. However, there were issues with repetition such as two station fires, two serial killer cops in the aforementioned Gabriel Kent and PC Cathy Bradford, non-cop serial killer plots in 2002, 2004 and 2005, over half a dozen different characters being abducted (some more than once) and a slew of romances (something rarely seen prior to Marquess' arrival). Arguably, the most controversial storyline was the insinuation that show veteran Sergeant June Ackland had slept with her own son after PC Gabriel Kent falsely claimed he was her long-lost son (actually proving to be her son's adoptive brother). June actress Trudie Goodwin criticised the plot in a 2018 interview on The Bill Podcast, calling it far-fetched to introduce the element of a long-lost child 20 years into her time on the series, while she also cited issues with character exits and the direction the show was going when she resigned from the role of June after over 20 years, stating she had lost her enjoyment of being on the programme. The mass dismissals included established show stars such as Tony O'Callaghan as Sergeant Matt Boyden and Mark Wingett as DC Jim Carver.", "In April 2021, reports emerged that The Bill could make a comeback in the form of a spin-off.
