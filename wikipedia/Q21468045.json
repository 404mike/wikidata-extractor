After he became famous as the main actor of Circo Orr\u00edn, one of the famous circuses of Mexico City and by becoming the most successful clown in the country, Bell founded his own Gran Circo Ricardo Bell. The poet Juan de Dios Peza wrote in El Monitor Republicano newspaper about Bell that he \"is more popular than pulque\", in an epoch were the pulque was the preferred alcoholic beverage in Mexico.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ricardo Bell", "response": ["Ricardo Bell may refer to:", "* Ricardo Bell (clown) (1851\u20131911), English clown and entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "Colonia Tabacalera", "response": ["From the 1930s to the 1950s, the colonia took on a bohemian reputation as writers and artists such as Juan Rulfo, Ricardo Bell, Nellie Campobello and Pablo Neruda lived here and the area was filled with traditional Mexican cantinas. It was also home to Cuban exiles such as Julio Antonio Mella and Fidel Castro. Argentine revolutionary Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara also lived here as an exile, working at the Hospital General in nearby Colonia Doctores. On 49 Jos\u00e9 de Empar\u00e1n Street in apartment C, the home of Cuban exile Maria Antonia Gonzalez, Fidel Castro met Che Guevara in July 1955. This began their collaboration which culminated in the Cuban Revolution."]}, {"page": "History of Colonia Roma", "response": ["In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the mostly dried lakebed areas west of Mexico City were being developed into \"modern\" colonias for the city's wealthy looking to leave the deteriorating city center. Aztacalco, then called La Romita or La Romerita, was established as a colonia in 1903. At about the same time, the rest of the land which is now Roma, called Hacienda de Romita or Potreros de Romita, was acquired by an investment group called Compan\u00eda de Terrenos de la Calzada de Chapultepec. This group included British circus owner Edward Walter Orrin, along with famous clown Ricardo Bell, U.S. engineer Casius Clay Lamm and his sons, and Mexican Pedro Lascur\u00e1in. The intent was to develop the land into a residential subdivision, which was approved by the city government in 1902, with the name of Roma instead of Romita. The project also had participation from the Porfirio D\u00edaz government, which commissioned itself to provide infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer, and would be the first colonia in Mexico City with these services. The colonia was also designed with wide streets, with tree-filled traffic islands and boulevards such as those in Paris. The names of these new streets came from the states and cities which the Orrin Circus had performed. The largest of these streets was and still is Avenida Alvaro Obregon, originally called Avenida Jalisco. Small parks such as Plaza Rio de Janeiro and Plaza Luis Cabrera were added for more green space. These streets and plazas still remain although a number of the wider streets such as Alvaro Obregon, Durango, Oaxaca, Quer\u00e9taro and San Luis Potos\u00ed have been converted into \"eje\" or axis roads for through traffic. The project also included the incorporation of the formerly separate La Romita, but residents resisted and the two communities remained socially separate."]}]}}
