He sat in the House of Commons from 1842 to 1846.\nFlower was High Sheriff of Norfolk from  1838 to 1839.In June 1841, he was asked by some of the electors in the borough of Thetford in Norfolk to contest the seat at the imminent general election.Nominations took place on 29 June, when Flower was nominated by Andrew Young and W. Watts Wickes.\nA show of hands declared to be in favour of Flower and his fellow Conservative Bingham Baring, but the third candidate and sitting Liberal MP Earl of Euston demanded a poll. Voting took place the following day, on 30 June, and the result was that Flower and Euston tied for second place with 71 votes each.  Amidst many challenges to the validity of votes, the mayor refused to exercise a casting vote, and returned the tied result; all three candidates were declared elected to the two seats.\nFlower submitted a petition,\nWhen the votes were scrutinised, Euston's total was reduced by one, and on 4 May 1842 he was declared unduly elected, thereby giving the seat to Flower.He did not contest the seat at the next general election, in 1847.", "link_mentions": {}}}
