For much of his career, he was also the club professional at Royal Liverpool, one of only a few touring professionals still to maintain a club role at that time. He seriously competed at the 1974 Open Championship. He was tied for the lead with the eventual champion Gary Player after the first round and remained in the top ten after rounds 2 and 3. He ultimately finished T-13. He won one tournament on the European Tour, the 1986 Jersey Open, when he overcame Peter Fowler in a play-off. During the 1970s and 1980s he also competed in Africa on the Safari Circuit, where he won four times, including the Nigerian Open and the Ivory Coast Open.\nAfter turning 50, Morgan played on the European Seniors Tour and the Champions Tour. He won the John Jacobs Trophy (European Seniors Order of Merit) in 1994, and was runner up in 1995 and 1996. He won eight European Seniors Tour tournaments including the PGA Seniors Championship twice. He had 59 top-10 finishes, of which 21 were top-3 and 100 top-20 finishes on the European Senior Tour.\nMorgan died of a brain tumour at the age of 62. He left behind a wife and four children.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Greg Norman", "response": ["| Antonio Garrido,  John Morgan"]}, {"page": "John Morgan", "response": ["John Morgan may refer
