Pentonville, designed by Joshua Jebb, used the \"separate system\" that kept prisoners in nearly complete isolation, to encourage reflection on their crimes. Jebb reviewed Henderson's plans in 1851, and to reduce the cost, he changed the two diagonal cell blocks that mimicked Pentonville into a four-storey linear structure, which would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere.  Construction began soon afterwards, supervised by Henderson, Manning, and Royal Engineer lieutenant Henry Wray, who had arrived with another convict ship. Within eighteen months of the Scindian\u2009's arrival, the convict population had grown to almost 1000. In 1855 convicts began to be moved into The Establishment, as the prison was then known as, but the project would not be completed until 1859."]}, {"page": "Charles Wray", "response": ["He was called to the bar in 1811 from Lincoln's Inn, and worked on the Northern Circuit; he was then nominated Recorder of Hull.
