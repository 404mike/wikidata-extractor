McGuckin was captain of the Derry team for 2007 and is currently the vice-captain. He is regarded as one of the best defenders in Ireland.McGuckin plays his club football for Ballinderry Shamrocks.

He is regarded as the complete footballer in that he has impressive high-fielding skills, is hard to dispossess, is very accurate in front of the posts with both feet and covers a lot of ground often tracking back to help in defence. Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin-point passes, and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game. Ballinderry and Derry teammate Kevin McGuckin described him as \"a magician on the ball and can do anything with it or put it anywhere with his passing\". GAA journalist and former Derry player Joe Brolly said of him: \"I cannot say I have ever seen a more elegant footballer\" and compared him to Kerry football legend Maurice Fitzgerald."]}, {"page": "Kevin McCloy", "response": ["McCloy had another impressive season in 2007. Regular captain Kevin McGuckin got injured in the latter stages of the National League and McCloy became stand-in captain on the field of play that summer until McGuckin's return. After being knocked out of the Ulster Championship by Monaghan at the semi-final stage, Derry advanced through the qualifiers with victories over Armagh, Mayo and Laois. Against Mayo McCloy shattered his little finger in three places while getting an accidental kick from Conor Mortimer. He displaced the bones so bad that they were pushed up beyond his knuckle. He played on and played against Laois two weeks later. Derry were paired with Dublin in the All-Ireland quarter-final. Nine days before the tie McCloy had an operation on the finger. The surgeon told him not to play contact sport for 10 weeks and if he did he would risk never having the full use of his finger again. He contacted 10 doctors to see if any would administer a painkilling injection, but they all refused. McCloy played the game and despite finishing on the losing side in a tight encounter, McCloy was awarded man of the match. On 19 October 2007 McCloy was named at full back on the 2007 All Star team. The award is the fifth All Star from the Lavey club, following in the footsteps of Anthony McGurk (twice), Johnny McGurk and Henry Downey."]}, {"page": "McGuckin", "response": ["*Kevin McGuckin, senior Gaelic footballer for Derry;"]}, {"page": "Kevin mcguckin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kevin McGuckin "]}, {"page": "2008 Derry county football team season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|BK||align=\"left\"|Kevin McGuckin||align=\"left\"|Ballinderry"]}, {"page": "2008 Ulster Senior Club Football Championship", "response": ["|6 || Kevin McGuckin || ", "| || Kevin McGuckin"]}, {"page": "2009 Derry county football team season", "response": ["| John Deighan, Barry Gillis, Shane Mc Guckin, Eoin Bradley, Paddy Bradley, Patsy Bradley, Paul Bradley, Seamus Bradley, Eoghan Brown, Paul Cartin, James Conway, Coilin Devlin, Ryan Dillon, Joe Diver, Fergal Doherty, James Kielt, Se\u00e1n Marty Lockhart, Mark Lynch, Enda Lynn, Brian \u00d3g McAlary, Dermot McBride, Kevin McCloy, Niall McCusker, Barry McGoldrick, Sean Leo McGoldrick, Kevin McGuckin, Barry McGuigan, Chrissy McKaigue, Enda Muldoon, Brain Mullan, Paul Murphy, Gerard O'Kane, Joe O'Kane, Paul Young, Joe Keenan.", "| Shane McGuckin, Barry Gillis, John Deighan, Se\u00e1n Marty Lockhart, Kevin McGuckin, Dermot McBride, Niall McCusker, Kevin McCloy, Carlos Mc Williams, Joe Keenan, Gerard O'Kane, Brian \u00d3g McAlary, Chrissy McKaigue, Paul Cartin, Barry McGoldrick, Sean Leo McGoldrick, Patsy Bradley, Fergal Doherty, Joe Diver, James Conway, Enda Muldoon, Gavin McShane, Paul Murphy, Enda Lynn, Brian Mullan, Paul Young, Barry McGuigan, James Kielt, Cailean O'Boyle, Eoghan Brown, Eoin Bradley, Mark Lynch, Seamus Bradley, Paddy Bradley, Danny Mulholland, Ciar\u00e1n Mullan, Joe Gray."]}]}}
