(an acronym of \"Missing in Acton\"), is a British rapper, singer, record producer and activist. Her songs contain evocative political and social commentary regarding immigration, warfare and identity in a globalised world. Her music combines elements of alternative, dance, electronic, hip hop and world music with eclectic instruments and samples.\nBorn in London to Sri Lankan Tamil parents, M.I.A. and her family moved to Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka when she was six months old. As a child, she experienced displacement caused by the Sri Lankan Civil War, which made the family return to London as refugees when M.I.A. was 11 years old; the war had a defining influence on M.I.A.'s artistry. She started out as a visual artist, filmmaker and designer in 2000, and began her recording career in 2002. One of the first acts to come to public attention through the Internet, she saw early fame as an underground artist in early 2004 with her singles \"Sunshowers\" and \"Galang\".\nM.I.A.'s first two albums, Arular (2005) and Kala (2007), received widespread critical acclaim for their experimentation with hip hop and electronic fusion. The single \"Paper Planes\" from Kala reached number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and sold over four million copies. Her third album Maya (2010) was preceded by the controversial single-short film \"Born Free\". Maya was her best-charting effort, reaching the top 10 on several charts. Her fourth studio album, Matangi (2013), included the single \"Bad Girls\", which won accolades at the MTV Video Music Awards. M.I.A. released her fifth studio album, AIM, in 2016. She scored her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single as a featured artist on Travis Scott's \"Franchise\" (2020).\nM.I.A.'s accolades include two American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) awards and two MTV Video Music Awards. She is the first person of South Asian descent to be nominated for an Academy Award and Grammy Award in the same year. She was named one of the defining artists of the 2000s decade by Rolling Stone, and one of the 100 most influential people of 2009 by Time. Esquire ranked M.I.A. on its list of the 75 most influential people of the 21st century. According to Billboard, she was one of the \"Top 50 Dance/Electronic Artists of the 2010s\".

Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \"a more analogue sound\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \"refreshing\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on the album, but was unable due to budget constraints and other artists' unfamiliarity with her work. She chose to perform all the vocals herself, saying, \"I just quietly got on with it\u00a0... I didn't wanna convince anyone it was good. I felt it was much better to prove that I could be an individual.\"", "Arular takes its title from the political code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, Arul Pragasam; she contends that her father's \"revolutionary ideals\" are the album's thematic base. \"In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something\", she remarked, \"but a friend pointed out that it was a pun in English \u2013 'a ruler' \u2013 which is funny because he is a politician. And my mum always used to say about my father, 'He was so useless, all he ever gave you was his name'. So I turned it around and turned that something into nothing.

If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking himself up and he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out to be me, and he'd have to get in touch\", a prediction which ultimately came true. Despite reports to the contrary, M.I.A. denied that her father was a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers.", "The album is influenced by music that M.I.A. listened to as a child in London, including hip hop, dancehall, and punk rock. She cited as particular influences Eric B. & Rakim, Public Enemy, and London Posse, whom she described as \"the best of British hip hop\". Her work on the album drew on the punk music of The Clash and music from genres such as Britpop and electroclash, to which she was exposed during her time studying at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Living in West London, she met many musicians who to her defined an era of British music that was \"actually credible\". In a 2008 interview, she elaborated on the importance of the west London punk scene, citing acts such as The Slits, The Clash, and Don Letts; she claimed that Bow Wow Wow and Malcolm McLaren had a similar cultural impact in England to that of Public Enemy in America.", "Before the album's release, M.I.A. said that audiences found it hard to dance to political songs. This made her keen to produce music that sounded like pop but addressed important issues.  \"Sunshowers\", with its lyrical references to snipers, murder and the PLO, was written in response to the Tamil Tigers being considered terrorists in some quarters. She said, \"you can't separate the world into two parts like that, good and evil. America has successfully tied all these pockets of independence struggles, revolutions and extremists into one big notion of terrorism.\" The lyrics caused controversy; MTV censored the sounds of gunshots in the song and MTV US refused to broadcast the video unless a disclaimer that disavowed the lyrics was added. The BBC described the lyrics as \"always fluid and never too rhetorical\" and sounding like \"snatches of overheard conversation\". The songs deal with topics ranging from sex to drug dealing.", "Musically, the album incorporates elements of baile funk, grime, hip hop, and ragga. Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, summed up the album's musical influences as \"anything as long as it has a beat\". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a \"multi-genre pile-up\" and likened it to her graphic art, calling it \"vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss\". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, \"Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles. I just accept where I'm at, I accept where the world is at and I accept how we receive and digest information. I get that somebody in Tokyo is on the internet instant messaging, and someone in the favelas is on the internet. Everybody seems to know a little bit about everything and that's how we process information now. This just reflects that.\"", "M.I.A. and Steve Loveridge created all the album's artwork, using what Spin writer Lorraine Ali called a \"guerrilla\" style. The CD booklet features motifs of tanks, bombs and machine guns, and depictions of tigers, which writers connected with the Tamil Tigers. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau connected the album's imagery with the artist's \"obsession\" with the organisation, but claimed that its use was purely artistic and not propaganda. In his view, the images were considered controversial only because \"rock and roll fans are assumed to be stupid\" and would not be expected to ascertain their true significance. Similarly, PopMatters writer Robert Wheaton observed that tiger imagery \"does predominate M.I.A.'s vision of the world\", but noted that the tiger is more widely associated with Tamil nationalism and that the singer's use of such imagery did not necessarily indicate her support for the Tamil Tigers. Joshua Chambers-Letson determined that the imagery was perhaps \"a means of negotiating the violence necessary\" and described the controversy as \"an attempt to disengage\" from the performative intervention that M.I.A.'s album's made, through what he called \"the complicated negotiation\" of M.I.A.'s own autobiographical trauma, violence, and loss, as well as the geopolitical trauma, violence, and loss that her audience are engaged in from different subject positions.", "Arular was to be released in September 2004, but was delayed. M.I.A.'s record label stated that the delay was caused by problems obtaining permission to use an unspecified sample.", " Revised release dates of December 2004 and February 2005 were publicised, but the album remained unreleased; at one point, Pitchfork announced that it had been shelved indefinitely. It was eventually released on 22 March 2005, when XL Recordings made it available in the US, albeit with the track \"U.R.A.Q.T.\" omitted as the issues with a sample had not been resolved. The UK edition was released the following month with the track included, and this edition was released in the US by Interscope Records on 17 May. Arular sparked internet debates on the rights and wrongs of the Tamil Tigers. By the time it was released, a \"near hysterical buzz\" on the internet had created \"slavish anticipation\" for the album. Despite this, M.I.A. claimed in late 2005 that she had little comprehension of her prior popularity with music bloggers, stating that she did not even own a computer.", "The first track from the album to be made available was \"Galang\". It was initially released in late 2003 by independent label Showbiz Records, which pressed and distributed 500 promotional copies before M.I.A. signed with XL Recordings. The song was re-released on XL as the second official single from the album in September 2004, and again in October 2005, under the title \"Galang '05\", with a remix by Serj Tankian. The first official single, \"Sunshowers\", was M.I.A.'s first on XL and was released on 5 July 2004. It was supported by a music video directed by Indian filmmaker Rajesh Touchriver. Following the re-release of \"Galang\", the third single from the album, \"Bucky Done Gun\", was released on 26 July 2005. The video was directed by Anthony Mandler.", "In December 2004, M.I.A. independently released a mixtape titled Piracy Funds Terrorism, produced by M.I.A. and Diplo, as a \"teaser\" for the album. The release featured rough mixes of tracks from Arular mashed up with songs by other artists, and was promoted by word-of-mouth. In early 2005, after the release of Arular, an extensive collection of fan-made remixes of M.I.A.'s work was uploaded, expanded and made available as an \"online mixtape\" on XL's official website, under the banner Online Piracy Funds Terrorism. M.I.A. toured extensively during 2005 to promote the album. The Arular Tour included concerts in North America supporting LCD Soundsystem and appearances at music festivals in Europe, Japan and South America. In November 2005, she appeared as the support act at a number of dates on Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour.", "Julianne Shepherd of Spin appreciated the album's fusion of \"hip hop's cockiness with dancehall's shimmy and the cheap and noisy aesthetics of punk\" and claimed that Arular would be regarded as the best political album of the year. Adam Webb, writing for Yahoo! Music, described the album's style as \"professionally amateurish\" and M.I.A.'s approach as \"scattergun\", but said that she \"effortlessly appropriates the music of various cultures and filters them through the most elementary equipment\". He said, \"dancehall is the primary influence, but also one of many seismic collisions with several other genres.\"", "In his review for Stylus Magazine, Josh Timmermann described Arular as \"a swaggering, spitting, utterly contemporary album\" and went on to say, \"We've not heard its like before.\" Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield found Arular \"weird, playful, unclassifiable, sexy, brilliantly addictive\". Sasha Frere-Jones, writing in The New Yorker, described the album as \"genuine world music\", based on \"the weaving of the political into the fabric of what are still, basically, dance tunes\". Other reviewers were not as complimentary.  Pastes Jeff Leven said that the album, although strong, was not as \"mindblowing\" as many critics were saying.  Q characterised the album as \"style mag-cool pop-rap\" and claimed that it lacked the substance suggested by M.I.A.'s decision to name it after her father.", "Arular was featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, where it was described as \"the most sparkling debut since Madonna's first album\". The singer Nelly Furtado expressed her admiration for M.I.A.'s style, flow and dancing on Arular, having listened to it during the recording of her album Loose. Thom Yorke of alternative rock band Radiohead cited M.I.A.'s method of music making on Arular as an influence on his own work, saying that it reminded him of \"just picking up a guitar and [liking] the first three chords you write\" as opposed to \"agonizing over the hi-hat sound which seems to happen with programming and electronica a lot of the time\". In 2009, the NME placed the album at number 50 in its list of the 100 greatest albums of the decade. In 2009, online music service Rhapsody ranked the album at number four on its \"100 Best Albums of the Decade\" list.
