Croxall announced the death of the Duke again before reading the press release. After the announcement, an image of the Duke was shown, with the national anthem played. Croxall continued to anchor the coverage before BBC News' lead anchor Huw Edwards took over from 1pm. Meanwhile, on ITV, a live interview on This Morning was interrupted, with host Eamonn Holmes quietly informed of the death by crew members in order to announce the news. He and Ruth Langsford brought the programme to an end and the network changed its feed to ITN for Lucrezia Millarini to announce the news. The other major British broadcasters, Sky News, Channel 4 and Channel 5, had similar responses, and all networks suspended regular programming until various times in the afternoon and evening of 9 April; programming on BBC Four was suspended for the entire day. BBC television presenters have black clothing on hand in the case of sudden high-profile deaths, and a BBC guideline saw all presenters and guests, during suspended programming, wearing black. On BBC channels, presenters were still dressed in black over the weekend following the Duke's death and on 12 April, while ITV presenters on Good Morning Britain on that date were not. Channel 4 was later criticised for continuing with much of its planned schedule on the evening of 9 April, but both the BBC and ITV received a flood of viewer complaints for postponing or cancelling their regular programmes to allow continuous coverage. Viewer ratings fell across the television networks except Channel 4, which gained viewers. By 13 April, the BBC had received nearly 111,000 complaints over its coverage, overtaking Jerry Springer: The Opera as Britain's most complained about broadcast."]}]}}
