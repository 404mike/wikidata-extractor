However, while traveling to France with the group, pianist Call Cobbs was detained at customs, causing him to arrive late and miss the first concert. Ayler's bagpipes were also damaged during the trip, and as a result they were difficult to use. Despite these setbacks, the group, which also included vocalist and saxophonist Mary Maria (Mary Parks), bassist Steve Tintweiss, and drummer Allen Blairman, performed the July 25 concert without Cobbs, resulting in the material that would be released on the album Live on the Riviera. According to David Keenan, Ayler dressed for the concert \"like he had just beamed down from the mothership, sporting a white oriental dress and a sombrero.\"", "During his stay, Ayler found time to visit the art exhibition, and became enamored with the paintings of Marc Chagall. He also participated in interviews with Caux and Kiyoshi Koyama of Swing Journal; these were recorded and later released on Holy Ghost: Rare & Unissued Recordings (1962\u201370). Cobbs arrived in time for the July 27 concert, and the performance elicited a very positive reaction from the audience. During the concert, Ayler turned to Cobbs and said \"Let's play something I don't normally do... Let's play the blues.\" According to Cobbs, when the piece, identified as \"Holy Family\" on the track listing, concluded, \"the people went wild about it\". David Keenan wrote that \"the Maeght concerts were a huge success and many people had to be turned away on the night.\"", "Val Wilmer called the album \"the declaration of an artist who has considered all the possibilities, and now offers this as a refined statement of his musical self\", and noted that \"many of the figures, themes and the feeling itself sprang directly, unadorned, from the Black church... It often seemed as if the church were the very place for which this music was intended.\" In his liner notes, David Keenan wrote that the music \"feels... like a last great summoning of powers... He draws on a huge reservoir of technique, digging deep into blues and gospel music and opening out to the roar of the cosmos... Ayler has rarely sounded so stately and - paradoxically - so at peace with himself... a lot of the material here feels as if he's finally come full circle, content to wrestle folk truths from the simplest of phrases, reducing the material to its most primal phonetics.\" He concludes by calling the recordings \"uncomfortable epitaphs, sometimes exhilarating, sometimes frustrating but above all, reassuringly human\"."]}, {"page": "Ashtray Navigations", "response": ["Whilst the music evades easy categorisation due to variations in sound, approach and personnel, it often incorporates extended droning and lengthy guitar pieces.
