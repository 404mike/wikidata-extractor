Instead, the law compelled the authorities to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price, but \"only in the form of bars containing approximately four hundred ounces troy [12\u00a0kg] of fine gold\". John Maynard Keynes, citing deflationary dangers, argued against resumption of the gold standard. By fixing the price at a level which restored the pre-war exchange rate of US$4.86 per pound sterling, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Churchill is argued to have made an error that led to depression, unemployment and the 1926 general strike.
