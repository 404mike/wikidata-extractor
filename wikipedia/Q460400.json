He argued that international movements of money and fluctuations in the exchange rate depended upon the international trade flows and not the manipulations of the bankers, which was the popular view at the time. He suggested that trading returns should be established for purposes of statistical analysis, so that the state could regulate trade with a view to obtaining export surpluses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1654 in literature", "response": ["**Edward Misselden, English mercantilist writer (born 1608)"]}, {"page": "Gerard de Malynes", "response": ["In 1622 Malynes and fellow merchant Edward Misselden began a famous dispute on free trade."]}, {"page": "Bullionism", "response": ["Gerard de Malynes (1586\u20131641), another bullionist, published a book named A Treatise of the Canker of England's Common Wealth, that asserted that the exchange of foreign currency had been a trade of value rather than exchanging the weight of metals. Therefore, the unfair exchanging of precious metals by bankers and money changers would cause a deficit in the English balance of trade. To ban the flow of exchange rates, he demanded the strict fixing of exchange rates for coins, only by the concentration of precious metals and weights, and for strict regulation and monitoring of foreign trade. He failed, however, to convince his contemporaries \u201c...that the cambists were responsible for gold outflow or to elicit enthusiasm for a monopoly sale of exchange, par pro pari, by the royal exchanger.\" He did succeed in creating one of the first economic controversies, and Edward Misselden opposed him in 1623 in his book The Circle of Commerce: Or, the Balance of Trade."]}, {"page": "Thomas Mun", "response": ["Influenced by his work as a merchant and his time spent as the director of the East India Company, the book covers a wide array of topics.  Most notably, however, England's Treasure is considered to be a direct repudiation of arguments made in regards to foreign trade by Gerard de Malynes and Edward Misselden.  Mun was opposed to a fixed exchange rate, as proposed by Malynes, and saw it as more of an impairment than a benefit to the economy.  In the book we also find the first notion of Mun's theory of the balance of trade.  It should be the focus of English policy, argued Mun, to export at a higher rate than it imports from abroad.  In doing so, the wealth of the country will inevitably increase."]}, {"page": "History of economic thought", "response": ["=== Edward Misselden and Gerard Malynes ===", "In 1622 English merchants Edward Misselden and Gerard Malynes began a dispute over free trade and the desirability of government regulation of companies, with Malynes arguing against foreign exchange as under the control of bankers, and Misselden arguing that international money exchange and fluctuations in the exchange rate depend upon international trade and not bankers, and that the state should regulate trade to insure export surpluses."]}, {"page": "Edward misselden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Misselden "]}, {"page": "Schools of economic thought", "response": ["*Edward Misselden"]}, {"page": "William Boswell", "response": ["A large share of Sir William's attention while ambassador was taken up with the controversy between the Gomarists and the Remonstrants (Arminians).
