She received her master's degree in fine art at the Royal College of Art (1999) and BA (Hons) in painting at Central St Martins School of Art (1994). She also received a Rome Scholarship in 2002. She has worked in various formats, predominantly on film and videos but also still life paintings, portraits and photographs.\nHer background stems from fine art painting but gravitated towards the moving images and sound because of its capacity to encompass narrative, abstraction, colour and movement for emotive effect through three-dimensional space but resulting like painting in a two-dimensional object. While still a painter she became interested in scale, sound, dialogue and moving pictures and in the absolute attention required by the viewer in a cinema environment, in its ability to provoke strong emotional responses from an audience. She continues to paint, and deconstructs film ideas for installation purposes. The content of her work evolves from the life experiences of herself and her friends, the imagination, abstract thoughts, observations, and a desire to play with the language of film and art.\nShe lives in London, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Decima Gallery", "response": ["*1998: The Sofa Show - Matt Calderwood and Louise Camrass.", "*2009: 19 December: Smash & Grab - Louise Camrass & Nelly Dimitranova - opening event at 97 Clerkenwell Road, Camden, London.
