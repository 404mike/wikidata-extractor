In that generally hostile account of his visit he wrote \"That, I think, was the day I began to hate the Mexicans\" and at another point described his \"growing depression, almost pathological hatred ... for Mexico.\" Pico Iyer has marveled at how Greene's responses to what he saw could be \"so dyspeptic, so loveless, so savagely self-enclosed and blind\" in his nonfiction treatment of his journey, though, as another critic has noted, \"nowhere in The Power and the Glory is there any indication of the testiness and revulsion\" in Greene's nonfiction report. Many details reported in Greene's nonfiction treatment of his Tabasco trip appeared in the novel, from the sound of a revolver in the police chief's holster to the vultures in the sky.
