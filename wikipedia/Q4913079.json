In 1918 he signed amateur terms with First Division Manchester City, turning professional when competitive football resumed after the war.

The most significant was the departure of inside-right Arthur Dominy to join First Division club Everton, who had reportedly been trying to sign him since as early as 1920. In a 13-year career at The Dell which began before the First World War, Dominy made a total of 392 appearances for the Saints and scored 155 goals, which at the time placed him second on the club's list of all-time appearances and third on the club's list of top goalscorers. He was replaced in the team by Sam Taylor, who joined from Mansfield Town in June 1926 for a club record fee of \u00a3950. Taylor soon switched to the left side, with fellow new arrival Dick Rowley taking over for the rest of the season after joining from Swindon Town.
