The home page consists of a million pixels arranged in a  pixel grid; the image-based links on it were sold for $1 per pixel in   blocks. The purchasers of these pixel blocks provided tiny images to be displayed on them, a URL to which the images were linked, and a slogan to be displayed when hovering a cursor over the link. The aim of the website was to sell all of the pixels in the image, thus generating a million dollars of income for the creator. The Wall Street Journal has commented that the site inspired other websites that sell pixels.", "Alex Tew, a student from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, conceived The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He was about to begin a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: \u00a31 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were \u20ac50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005."]}, {"page": "Tew", "response": ["*Alex Tew, British Internet self-promoter"]}, {"page": "Sexey's School", "response": ["*Alex Tew, creator of Million Dollar Homepage"]}, {"page": "Boogami", "response": ["James was inspired after seeing Alex Tew's success with the Million Dollar Homepage and wanted to see if he could take the pixel phenomenon a step further by integrating a pixel gird directly under the search box of a search engine.

Bush during a news conference. While a hastily-put together crudity, it went viral and received widespread news coverage right around its release, only a day after the actual incident. It's a well-known example of a newsgame. The name of the game is a pun on the US shock and awe military tactic.", "Alex Tew, the author, was a \"student entrepreneur\" at the time, and previously \"Internet famous\" for The Million Dollar Homepage, a successful ploy website that helped him pay for his college tuition. On December 18, the day of the shoe throwing incident, Tew was part of a group of people on Twitter trading ideas  on what might be a good tabloid headline describing the incident when somebody suggested \"Sock and Awe.\" Already by the following day, Tew had registered the domain sockandawe.com, developed and uploaded the game. Two days later, the game had already been played 1.4 million times. At the end of the week, Tew had managed to sell the site on eBay for \u00a35,215 GBP to a company called Fubra.
