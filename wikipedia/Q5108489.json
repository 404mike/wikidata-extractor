He returned to Luton on loan in 2002/03, and was all set to return on a Bosman transfer in the summer of 2003 as well as fellow loanee Sammy Igoe.\nHowever, the take-over and subsequent dismissal of the Luton management team saw Willmott join Northampton Town instead, where he scored once against Cambridge United. In the summer of 2005, Willmott joined Oxford United on a free transfer from Northampton. 'Motty' missed the majority of the 2007/08 season through a knee injury. \nHe was released by Oxford United at the end of the 2008/09 season. Willmott signed a two-year contract with Southern League Premier Division side Brackley Town. Willmott then played for Conference North team Oxford City where he was vice-captain.\nAfter retiring from football he went into teaching, becoming a master at Bedford Modern School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bedford Modern School", "response": ["* Chris Willmott (born 1977), football coach and retired English footballer"]}, {"page": "Craig Nelthorpe", "response": ["He was released by Doncaster at his own request on 13 January 2009 and joined Conference Premier club Oxford United the next day on a contract until the end of the 2008\u201309 season.

Nelthorpe was named on standby for the England C team, who represent England at non-League level, in February 2009, for a friendly against Malta under-21s. He was sent off against Torquay United after clashing with Mustapha Carayol, which resulted in a three-match suspension, and following this he said he was looking to use his aggression more effectively. He made his return in a 2\u20131 victory over Kettering Town on 19 March 2009, during which he opened the scoring with a 20-yard free kick and assisted the second goal with a corner kick that was headed in by Chris Willmott.
