At the election he was elected as Member of Parliament for the Plymouth Sutton constituency.  In his time in Parliament he became Parliamentary Private Secretary.  He was narrowly re-elected at the 1964 general election.  However he was defeated at the 1966 general election by the Labour candidate David Owen, who went on to become Foreign Secretary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Thatcher", "response": ["In 1954, Thatcher was defeated when she sought selection to be the Conservative Party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years stating: \"I really just felt the twins were [...] only two, I really felt that it was too soon. I couldn't do that.\" Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election. Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, Thatcher's maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her private member's bill, the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960, requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; the bill was successful and became law. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment."]}]}}
