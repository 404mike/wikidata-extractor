Inside the library is a dodecagonal reading room, inspired by that of the British Museum, and a former medieval chapel, now an exhibition space showcasing the special collections of the library. The library was named in honour of Sir Deryck Maughan, an alumnus of the university.", "In 2001 King's College London acquired the building from the Crown Estate and appointed a design team led by Gaunt Francis Architects to oversee the renovation. The renovation took two-years, at a cost of \u00a335m. During the works, two rare painted zinc ceilings from the 1860s (one forms part of the ceiling of the round reading room and another is located above the lobby entrance) and a fine 1901 tessellated floor were discovered. Former president of RIBA, Maxwell Hutchinson commented on the project, \"I have to say that this is one of the best marriages between an important redundant building and a new use I've come across in a very long time.\" The library was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2002, and the project received the 2003 City Heritage Award. The library was named after Sir Deryck Maughan, an alumnus of King's, who together with Lady Maughan made a \u00a34m donation towards the new university library. It is the largest new university library in Britain since World War II."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Sir Deryck Maughan \u2013 CEO of Salomon Brothers"]}, {"page": "List of trustees of the British Museum", "response": ["*Deryck Maughan (appointed 2013)"]}, {"page": "Maughan (surname)", "response": ["*Deryck Maughan (born 1947), British businessman and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "List of Stanford GSB alumni", "response": ["* Sir Deryck Maughan, British businessman and philanthropist"]}]}}
