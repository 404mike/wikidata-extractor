The regiment 485 strong embarked from Portsmouth on 1 August under the command of Lt-Col Robert Frederick (eldest son of the original second-in-command) and after arrival in Dublin marched to Mullingar. The arrival of the militia relieved regiments of the King's German Legion for service in the Peninsular War. The militia's duties included sending detachments to assist the revenue and police service. By the end of 1812 almost half the regiment was detached to Granard on this duty. The regiment continued to provide volunteers to the regulars, about 100 each year, who were replaced by recruits from a militia depot established on the Isle of Wight under the Hon Thomas Cranley Onslow (appointed colonel of the 2nd RLM after the resignation of his father in 1812), though there was criticism of the quality of the recruits received by the regiment. In May 1813 the regiment concentrated at Mullingar and marched to Dublin to await passage back to England, embarking on 30 June. In England it rejoined the depot and the recruiting parties operating across Surrey. The regiment was stationed at Woodbridge, Suffolk, until 4 September, when it moved to Chelmsford Barracks.Davis, pp. 176\u201384.", "The quota set for the 2nd RSM was 990 men in 10 companies, with a permanent staff of 28. Most of the few remaining old sergeants of the permanent staff were pensioned off, and Col the Hon Thomas Cranley Onslow, who had been in command since 1812, retired and was succeeded by the Earl of Lovelace, with Viscount Cranley as his lieutenant-colonel (first appointed in 1850). The reorganised regiment completed recruiting to its full establishment on 10 December 1852. It was called out for its first 28 days' training in April 1853 (though almost 400 of the enrolled men failed to appear), for which 40 drill instructors were borrowed from the regular army garrison at Chatham. Drill parades were held at the Woodbridge Road cricket ground in Guildford. When the regiment was not assembled, the permanent staff were available to assist the civil authorities of Guildford in suppressing riots in the town.Davis, pp. 221\u201333.Burke's: 'Lovelace'. In 1854 the regiment began building a barracks in Guildford, close to the River Wey, for the permanent staff, armoury, etc..'Guildford Militia Barracks 1854\u20131876' at Queen's Royal Surreys.", "* Col Hon Thomas Cranley Onslow, former captain, 3rd Foot Guards, appointed 15 March 1812, resigned 14 August 1852"]}]}}
