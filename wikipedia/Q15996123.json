He represented constituencies in County Donegal as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the United Kingdom House of Commons and later as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\nA barrister, Law was the second son of Hugh Law, who had been Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1881 to 1883, and  his  wife  Helen White, and was educated in England at Wixenford School. He was returned as an Irish Parliamentary Party member of the Westminster parliament for Donegal West at an unopposed by-election in April 1902, and was unopposed at successive general elections until he stood down at the 1918 general election, when the seat was won by Joseph Sweeney of Sinn F\u00e9in.\nAt the 1923 Irish general election he was an unsuccessful Farmers' Party candidate for the 5th D\u00e1il in the Donegal constituency.  He stood again as a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate at the June 1927 general election and was elected to the 6th D\u00e1il.

The core of this party group was however solidly Sinn F\u00e9in, IRB and IRA in background.
