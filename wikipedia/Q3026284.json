She is particularly noted for recreating the style of the original artists in her animations, for example of Raymond Briggs's picture book, The Snowman.\nShe also directed Granpa by John Burningham in 1989 and was due to direct Raymond Briggs' Father Christmas in 1991, having completed storyboarding for the film, although due to her illness this was directed by Dave Unwin. She also planned the first series of animated adaptations of the tales of Beatrix Potter as The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends. However, she died of cancer on New Year's Eve 1992 at the age of 51. The series episode \"The Tailor of Gloucester\", which was made the year after she died, is \"dedicated to [her] memory\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film", "response": ["| John Coates & Dianne Jackson"]}, {"page": "The Snowman", "response": ["The Snowman is a 1982 British animated television film and symphonic poem based on Raymond Briggs' 1978 picture book The Snowman.

It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film and won a BAFTA TV Award.", "In March 1982, Coates presented an \"animatic\" storyboard version with a basic piano track by Howard Blake, including an early version of \"Walking in the Air\" to commissioning executives at the fledgeling Channel 4, a new public service television company which was due to begin broadcasting in November 1982. The director Dianne Jackson had worked with Coates on The Beatles' Yellow Submarine and had mainly worked on short animations and commercials; this was her first time directing a longer animated film. As a result, the experienced animator Jimmy T. Murakami was brought in to supervise. The film was produced using traditional animation techniques, consisting of pastels, crayons and other colouring tools drawn on pieces of celluloid, which were traced over hand drawn frames. For continuity purposes, the background artwork was painted using the same tools.", "* Granpa, Dianne Jackson's second animated film for Channel 4, with music by Howard Blake."]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Dianne Jackson"]}, {"page": "Waldegrave School", "response": ["* Dianne Jackson, animator, director of The Snowman"]}, {"page": "Yellow Submarine (film)", "response": ["National and foreign animators were assembled by TVC.

Blake was initially reluctant due to the book's upsetting ending, but was convinced after witnessing his own daughter's reaction to her grandfather's death that year.", "The film has rarely been repeated, and has never been released on DVD, perhaps due to its subject matter. The \"Toonhound\" review suggest that the film takes the tone of the ending of The Snowman even further, \"exploring an aspect of life rarely approached in animated form.\" Paul Madden, writing Dianne Jackson's obituary in 1993 suggests that the film \"was less of immediate popular appeal than The Snowman, but was perhaps more satisfying to her creatively, demanding a more subtle approach.\" Toonhound notes that \"Just like that film there is a tangible sense of loss at the end; a loss which builds with repeated viewings.
