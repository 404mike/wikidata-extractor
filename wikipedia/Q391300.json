He served at the Department for Education under Conservative Prime Ministers David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. A member of the Conservative Party, Gibb has also served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton since 1997.Nick Gibb was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire and was educated at the College of St Hild and St Bede at the University of Durham. After unsuccessfully campaigning to become an MP in Stoke-on-Trent Central at the 1992 general election and Rotherham in the 1994 by-election, Gibb was elected to the British House of Commons for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton at the 1997 general election.\nGibb was Shadow Minister for Schools from 2005 to 2010. He was appointed as Minister of State for School Standards by Prime Minister David Cameron, serving from May 2010 and September 2012. After serving as a backbencher for two years, Gibb returned to government as Minister of State for School Reform in July 2014. Gibb was promoted to his previous role as Minister of State for School Standards after the 2015 general election, replacing his initial successor in the Coalition government, David Laws. He retained this position during the premiership of Theresa May. He was retained as Minister of State for School Standards by May's successor, Boris Johnson; Gibb was removed from the role in September 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Calculator", "response": ["In most countries, students use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or elementary arithmetic skills would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations in the head, with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching estimation methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in. Others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy, or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts. In December 2011 the UK's Minister of State for Schools, Nick Gibb, voiced concern that children can become \"too dependent\" on the use of calculators. As a result, the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the Curriculum. In the United States, many math educators and boards of education have enthusiastically endorsed the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards and actively promoted the use of classroom calculators from kindergarten through high school."]}, {"page": "September 3", "response": ["*1960 \u2013 Nick Gibb, English accountant and politician"]}, {"page": "Phonics", "response": ["Prior to that, synthetic phonics was promoted by a cross-party group of Parliamentarians, particularly Nick Gibb MP. A report by the House of Commons Education and Skills Committee called for a review of the phonics content in the National Curriculum. Subsequently, the Department for Education and Skills announced a review into early years reading, headed by Sir Jim Rose, former Director of Inspection for Ofsted (responsible for the education standards in the UK). The review, entitled Independent review of the teaching of early reading (Rose Report 2006), addresses the question of why children's reading and writing (especially for boys) have not been meeting expectations. Paragraph 3.25 of the Final Report states \"This suggests that it is far more often the nature of the teaching than the nature of the child which determines success or failure in learning the 'basic' skills of reading and writing.\u201d It goes on to say it is not suggesting teachers are unable or unwilling to develop the required expertise, only that there has been systematic confusion and conflicting views about phonics. It also makes it clear that, when it comes to the wider knowledge and skills required for reading and writing, phonics work is \"necessary but not sufficient\". It concludes by suggesting the challenge will be resolved as research continues to support systematic phonics, and that teacher training and systematic phonics programs will produce \"good results for children\".", "The 2016 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) awarded England its best results since the studies began in 2001. Nick Gibb attributes this success to the use of systematic synthetic phonics. In March of that year the Secretary of State for Education released a report entitled Educational Excellence Everywhere. The report states that in 2010 33% percent of primary school students did not achieve the expected standard in reading, however \"since the introduction of the phonics reading check in 2012\", that number is down to 20%. The report goes on to say they still have much to do, particularly with students who are disadvantaged. The phonics check involves pupils reading aloud 40 words (including 20 non-words). In 2016, 81 per cent of pupils reached the expected standard of 32 correct words \u2013 up from 77 per cent in 2015."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Nick Gibb", "| Nick Gibb"]}, {"page": "West Sussex", "response": ["|Nick Gibb"]}, {"page": "Littlehampton", "response": ["Littlehampton lies within the parliamentary constituency of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the Member of Parliament (MP) for which is Conservative Nick Gibb."]}, {"page": "Bognor Regis", "response": ["Bognor Regis lies within the constituency of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the MP for which is Nick Gibb (Conservative)."]}, {"page": "List of current members of the British Privy Council", "response": ["| Nick Gibb"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Nick Gibb"]}, {"page": "Minister for Women and Equalities", "response": ["| |Nick Gibb (Minister for Equalities)Anne Milton (Minister for Women)"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["*Nick Gibb (b. 1960)"]}, {"page": "College of St Hild and St Bede, Durham", "response": ["File:Nick Gibb Minister.jpg|Nick Gibb, Conservative MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton", "* Nick Gibb, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.
