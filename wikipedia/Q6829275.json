As CBI president he witnessed the fall of the administration of Edward Heath in the wake of the miners' strike, and the re-emergence of the Labour Party under Harold Wilson. He was directly involved, along with CBI director-general Campbell Adamson, in intense and volatile debate on voluntary pay restraint and price controls with Health and trade union leaders.\nClapham who was a classical scholar and a master printer by trade, also invented an isotope diffusion barrier whilst working on silk screen printing techniques during World War II which led to him being seconded to the Tube Alloys Project pursuing the development of the atom bomb.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Clapham", "response": ["Michael Clapham (born 15 May 1943) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnsley West and Penistone from 1992 to 2010.", "*Michael Clapham, MP", "*ePolitix \u2013 Michael Clapham official site", "*Guardian Unlimited Politics \u2013 Ask Aristotle: Michael Clapham MP", "*TheyWorkForYou.com \u2013 Michael Clapham MP", "*The Public Whip \u2013 Michael Clapham MP voting record"]}, {"page": "Tube Alloys", "response": ["The chemical problems of producing gaseous compounds of uranium and pure uranium metal were studied at the University of Birmingham and by ICI. Michael Clapham, who at the time was working on print technology at the Kynoch Works in Aston in Birmingham, carried out early experiments with uranium production processes. Philip Baxter from ICI, where he had experience working with fluorine compounds, made the first small batch of gaseous uranium hexafluoride for Chadwick in 1940. ICI received a formal \u00a35,000 contract in December 1940 to make  of this vital material for the future work. The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment itself was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers (MetroVick) at Trafford Park, Manchester, at a cost of \u00a3150,000 for four units. They were installed at the M. S. Factory located in a valley near Rhydymwyn, in Wales; M. S. stood for the Ministry of Supply. The building used was known as P6 and test equipment was installed. These units were tested by a team of about seventy under the guidance of Peierls and Fuchs. The results of the experiments led to the building of the gaseous diffusion factory at Capenhurst, Cheshire. ICI pilot plants for producing  of pure uranium metal and  of uranium hexafluoride per day commenced operation in Widnes in mid-1943."]}, {"page": "Industrial Relations Act 1971", "response": ["Prime Minister Edward Heath called a general election over the issue of \"Who Governs Britain?\" in February 1974, during a lengthy dispute with the National Union of Mineworkers.

Adamson's statement made headlines, and was thought to have damaged the Conservative Party's election prospects.

In 1979, Wainwright found a suitable buyer, Gilmer and Dean, but the press closed in 1981 under the duress of a failed management buyout due in part to the union's unwillingness to accept any layoffs.
