Seeton, a gentle parody of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.  These were made available as eBooks in 2016.Seriously injured in a road traffic accident near his home at Appledore, Kent, in August 1979, he never fully recovered and died in hospital the following February.Ten years after Carvic's death, his books were re-issued in the US and proved sufficiently popular for his Estate to commission further Miss Seeton stories from two other writers using pseudonyms with \"HC\" initials. Roy Peter Martin as \"Hampton Charles\" wrote three novels, which were all released in 1990. Sarah J. Mason, writing as \"Hamilton Crane\", then took up the series.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Hobbit", "response": ["The BBC Radio 4 series The Hobbit radio drama was an adaptation by Michael Kilgarriff, broadcast in eight parts (four hours in total) from September to November 1968.

By mid-March 1964, the serial's guest cast had been finalised. Veteran actor George Coulouris was cast in the role of Arbitan; Gorrie immediately thought of Coulouris for the role while reading the script, and was delighted when he accepted the part, describing Coulouris as his \"hero\". Francis de Wolff was selected to play Vasor, while Donald Pickering played Eyesen. Gorrie cast Henley Thomas as Tarron; the two were old friends who had previously worked together. Robin Phillips, who was also friends with Gorrie, was cast as Altos; Gorrie felt that Phillips' handsome looks fit the role of Altos accurately. Similarly, he wanted the character of Sabetha to resemble a princess, and selected former drama student Katharine Schofield. Gorrie was impressed by the sinister voice of Heron Carvic, casting him as the Voice of Morpho, and the role of Kala was given to Fiona Walker, who had written to Gorrie for a role. For the role of the Voord, among other villains, three young actors, who were friends of Gorrie, were cast: Martin Cort, Peter Stenson, and Gordon Webster."]}, {"page": "The Man Born to Be King", "response": ["Heron Carvic, originally suggested by the writer, played Caiaphas in every version of the cycle (as well as in the broadcast of Sayers' Lichfield Passion in 1947).
