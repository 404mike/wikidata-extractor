Seeton, a gentle parody of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.  These were made available as eBooks in 2016.Seriously injured in a road traffic accident near his home at Appledore, Kent, in August 1979, he never fully recovered and died in hospital the following February.Ten years after Carvic's death, his books were re-issued in the US and proved sufficiently popular for his Estate to commission further Miss Seeton stories from two other writers using pseudonyms with \"HC\" initials. Roy Peter Martin as \"Hampton Charles\" wrote three novels, which were all released in 1990. Sarah J. Mason, writing as \"Hamilton Crane\", then took up the series.", "link_mentions": {}}}
