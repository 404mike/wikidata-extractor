Educated at Loretto College, he was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional fast-medium right-arm bowler. His was a curious first-class cricket career: he played 22 matches over 14 years (though he appeared in only six of those seasons) and was used as a specialist batsman. Yet his career average was less than 10. This lack of success is more remarkable as he passed 50 runs in an innings twice in his career, one of them a not-out innings.", "link_mentions": {}}}
