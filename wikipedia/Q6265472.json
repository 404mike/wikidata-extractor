He was with Ralph Fitzwilliam, the king's lieutenant in Yorkshire, as a member of the itinerary court constituted by the first commission of Trailbaston for Yorkshire, for which Hemingford gives a date of 1304. A parliamentary writ of 23 November 1304 is addressed to Barton and Fitzwilliam, with two others, but their names do not appear in the later and greater commission for all the counties. He was appointed a commissioner to inquire as to a specie chest found on the Yorkshire coast and claimed as wreck by the king, and also in 8 Edward II to levy scutage in Yorkshire.\nIn 24 Edward I Barton was summoned to military service against the Scots, and was on the commission of array for Yorkshire in 28 Edward I, and again in 31 Edward I.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Barton", "response": ["*John de Barton, 14th century English judge"]}, {"page": "Ralph Fitzwilliam", "response": ["Walter of Guisborough tells that in 1304 Ralph was commissioned with John de Barton to act as a justice to execute the statute of trailbaston (an itinerant judicial commission) in Yorkshire;H.C.
