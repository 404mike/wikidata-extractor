Bulman was assisted by two other pilots in subsequent flight testing; Philip Lucas flew some of the experimental test flights, while John Hindmarsh conducted the firm's production flight trials.Bader 2004, pp. 37, 40.

In the 90s he followed this with The Judas Trail (1996) and Shadows (1996). By this point, Royce's Bulman differs from the television version considerably - his is called Alfred George Bulman (the TV one is George Kitchener Bulman), and by The Crypto Man in 1985 has risen to be a Detective Superintendent in the Security Services section of the Metropolitan Police (his TV alternative never made it above Detective Chief Inspector before becoming a private investigator)."]}, {"page": "W. E. W. Petter", "response": ["Specification F7/41 required a minimum speed to 415mph at 33,000ft with a maximum ceiling of 42,000ft. The Air Ministry also wanted low altitude manoeuvrability and a +9G ultimate load factor. The speed was equivalent to a Mach number of 0.62 while the loading condition caused Petter to select a thick wing section which would later be demonstrated to have a critical Mach number of 0.6. The significance of the thick wing section may not have been understood by Petterbecause compressibility effects had only started to be encountered by aircraft designers.Roland Beamont states that George Bulman was probably the first pilot among the allied nations to describe the effects of compressibility on aircraft handing in a memorandum at Langley in 1943 During test flying the effect of compressibility was experienced by Penrose who wrote, \"In speed runs at the ceiling the wings and fuselage sometimes shook as though the machine was bumping over cobblestones.\"  Petter was reluctant to believe Penrose or accept that the wing would not be acceptable for high speed at altitude."]}, {"page": "Hawker Cygnet", "response": ["In 1924, the Royal Aero Club organized a Light Aircraft Competition. \u00a33000 was offered in prizes. An entry was made by Hawker Aircraft, which was a design by Sydney Camm, the Cygnet. Camm had joined Hawker the previous year. Two aircraft were built (G-EBMB and G-EBJH) and were entered in the competition, held in 1924 at Lympne Aerodrome, by T. O. M. Sopwith and Fred Sigrist. The aircraft were flown by Longton and Raynham and came in 4th and 3rd places respectively. In 1925, G-EBMB was entered again in the 100\u00a0mi (161\u00a0km) International Handicap Race, this time flown by George Bulman, who won at a speed of 75.6\u00a0mph (121.7\u00a0km/h). At the same meeting, the Cygnet came in 2nd in the 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) Light Aeroplane Race.

Official trials of the F7/30 types were delayed until 1935 owing to problems with some of the other competitors, and Hawker used the delay to fit a slightly more powerful version of the Goshawk.  While the P.V.3 was praised for its handling and performance during testing at RAF Martlesham Heath, no order resulted, as in the meantime Gloster's Gladiator, another Private Venture design, had been ordered into production.
