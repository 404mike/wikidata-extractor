The match was umpired by a New Zealander, Fred Goodall, and the English umpire, Dickie Bird. By officiating in the match, Bird became the only umpire to stand in both a men's and women's World Cup final, having previously umpired the 1975 Cricket World Cup Final. The England captain, Susan Goatman, won the toss, and chose to bat first on a pitch described as \"placid\" by the Australian press. The England opening batters, Brittin and Goatman, scored slowly, putting on 42 runs together before Brittin was dismissed by a diving catch from Marie Cornish off her own bowling for 17 runs. England scored another 12 runs before Goatman was bowled by Lyn Fullston for 29. Fullston was also the bowler for the next wicket; Chris Watmough was caught at mid-on by Kennare for 9, and England were 63 for three. England's experienced partnership of Jan Southgate and Rachael Heyhoe-Flint aimed to recover the England innings, but were restricted by Australia's spin bowling. Southgate in particular was described in The Age as being \"uncomfortable against the spin\", while The Times criticised Heyhoe-Flint for \"not forcing the pace when England had wickets in hand.\" In the final ten overs, the England batters began to score more quickly; but both were dismissed shortly before the close of the innings. Southgate, who made the team's highest score, 53 runs, was caught by Sharyn Hill off the bowling of Sharon Tredrea, while Heyhoe-Flint was caught by Fullston off Tredrea's bowling for 29.
