It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual split screen method. He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: \"Few viewers probably notice how much of Annie Hall consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be\u00a0... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship.\" He cites a study that calculated the average shot length of Annie Hall to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4\u20137 seconds. Peter Cowie suggests that \"Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained.\" Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation in the use of the split-screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.", "More critically, Peter Cowie commented that the film \"suffers from its profusion of cultural references and asides\". Writing for New York magazine, John Simon called the film \"unfunny comedy, poor moviemaking, and embarrassing self-revelation,\" and wrote that Keaton's performance was \"in bad taste to watch and indecency to display,\" saying that the part should have been played by Robin Mary Paris, the actress who appears briefly in the scene where Alvy Singer has written a two-character play nakedly based on himself and Annie Hall. Simon's review of Annie Hall  \"It is a film so shapeless, sprawling, repetitious, and aimless as to seem to beg for oblivion. At this, it is successful.\"John Simon, New York Magazine, May 2, 1977, pg. 74", "Annie Hall \"is as much a love song to New York City as it is to the character,\" reflecting Allen's adoration of the island of Manhattan. It was a relationship he explored repeatedly, particularly in films like Manhattan (1979) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). Annie Hall's apartment, which still exists on East 70th Street between Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue is by Allen's own confession his favorite block in the city. Peter Cowie argues that the film shows \"a romanticized view\" of the borough, with the camera \"linger[ing] on the Upper East Side [... and where] the fear of crime does not trouble its characters.\" By contrast, California is presented less positively, and David Halle notes the obvious \"invidious intellectual comparison\" between New York City and Los Angeles. While Manhattan's movie theaters show classic and foreign films, Los Angeles theaters run less-prestigious fare such as The House of Exorcism and Messiah of Evil. Rob's demonstration of adding canned laughter to television demonstrates the \"cynical artifice of the medium\". New York City serves as a symbol of Alvy's personality (\"gloomy, claustrophobic, and socially cold, but also an intellectual haven full of nervous energy\") while Los Angeles is a symbol of freedom for Annie."]}, {"page": "Cries and Whispers", "response": ["In his book, Images, Bergman wrote: \"Today I feel that in Persona\u2014and later in Cries and Whispers\u2014I had gone as far as I could go.

If you don't know the rules, you are crushed; but if you do know the rules you are cut off from your own nature.\" Dudley Andrew described the film's \"complex social criticism\"DVD notes, pp. 5\u20136 while Kenneth BrowserDVD notes, p.32 and Peter Cowie wrote about its sense of humanity.DVD notes, p.34 Other critics have written about the film's darker themes; Andrew Sarris praised its depiction of class differences. The complexity of Renoir's storytelling techniques have been examined by Roger Ebert, who called it \"so simple and so labyrinthine, so guileless and so angry, so innocent and so dangerous, that you can't simply watch it, you have to absorb it\", Lucy Sante, who called it \"a dense clockwork mechanism\" and Robin Wood, who said the film \"operates on all levels.\"DVD notes, p.30 Critics have praised its farcical elements: Pauline Kael called it \"a great satirical comedy, a dance of death\" and Gerald Mast wrote \"[it] depicts the failure of love, the failure of society, and the failure of men to rise above the ridiculous. Their only success is that they try and they care.\" David Thomson praised Renoir's performance and remarked on \"Renoir's admission that the director, supposedly the authoritative and manipulating figure, is as much victim as originator of circumstances.\" Amy Taubin said \"I can think of no other film that is as unfailingly generousto its audience, its characters, its actors, the milieu and the medium.\"DVD notes, p.29 J.

The film's exploration of duality, insanity and personal identity has been interpreted as reflecting the Jungian theory of persona and dealing with issues related to filmmaking, vampirism, homosexuality, motherhood, abortion and other subjects. The experimental style of its prologue and storytelling has also been noted.
