The club then had a total of 30 points docked from its 2008\u201309 record by the Football Association and the Football League for financial irregularities dating back several years.

The Blades reached the Championship playoff final in 2009 under Kevin Blackwell, but a period of decline then set in. The 2010\u201311 season proved disastrous, with the club employing three different managers in the span of a season, which ultimately ended in relegation to League One under Micky Adams, meaning they would play in the third tier of English football for the first time since 1989.

Former assistant manager Kevin Blackwell was appointed as Robson's replacement but despite reaching the play-off finals in his first full season the team was obviously in decline and he was sacked after only two games of the 2010\u201311 season.  Worse was to come however as player-coach Gary Speed was briefly promoted to manager but left after only a few months to take over the Welsh national side. Micky Adams then became the third full-time manager of the season, and oversaw a disastrous run of results which saw United relegated and Adams sacked after only six months in charge."]}, {"page": "Neil Warnock", "response": ["On 30 October 2021, he equalled the record for the most games managed in English professional football at 1,601 with a 2\u20130 loss to Birmingham City.

In a bid to keep hold of the pair, the club offered them both significantly improved terms. Later that day, Swindon confirmed that they had reached a suitable financial settlement package with Leeds for the services of Dennis Wise and Gus Poyet and that they looked set to join. Following the successful negotiation of acceptable compensation in line with the expectations of Swindon Town, on 24 October, the boards of both clubs officially confirmed that Dennis Wise, Gus Poyet and Andrew Beasley had joined Leeds United as manager, assistant manager and goalkeeping coach respectively."]}, {"page": "Bramall Lane", "response": ["Located on Shorham Street, The Kop has been seated since 1991, this is the area in which the most boisterous home fans sit, such that former assistant manager (1999\u20132003) and manager (2008\u201310) Kevin Blackwell named the noise coming from this stand as the \"Bramall Roar\" after the 2003 play-off semi-final second-leg against Nottingham Forest, which the Blades won 4\u20133, coming from 0\u20132 down.see \"The Kop sponsored by Hallam FM\" The stand is currently sponsored by Kennedy's Law and, was formerly sponsored by Hallam FM. The stand itself is built into a hillside situated behind the goal, at the east end of the stadium. This places the stand along Shoreham Street, hence the often-heard chant of \"Hello! Hello! We are the Shoreham Boys\" coming from this stand on matchdays. See \"What do the Sheffield United fans sing?\" It has the club's initials \"SUFC\" written into the seats, and holds 10,221 fans, making this the largest stand at Bramall Lane. The facilities are of lower quality in the Kop because there is no indoor concourse, although an outdoor bar was completed in September 2007 to complement the fast-food takeaway, but in spite of this it is still a firm favourite amongst the fans, and usually full on matchday. At a Shareholders' meeting in November 2007 the club announced that it intended to expand the Kop by 3,500 (making it the largest 'kop' in the country) and to upgrade all the facilities and cover the concourse areas.see \"The Kop Stand\" However, since then, former chief executive Trevor Birch announced that the extension will not be taken into consideration until the club can gain and maintain Premier League status.
