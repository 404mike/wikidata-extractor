He was the first, and to date the only, player for Stockport County to win an England cap. Hardy made 207 appearances for Stockport. He made his unremarkable debut against Cardiff on 4 September 1920, conceding three goals. He then went on the make 170 consecutive appearances for the club before he missed his first County game, a 1\u20131 draw with Southampton on 11 October 1924, due to his involvement with the Football League representative side. He also played for Everton and Bury.\nHe is thought of as County's best ever goalkeeper. His statistics, though, in the Hatters' Division Three (North) championship season in 1922, are remarkable.\nHardy was an ever-present conceding just 21 goals, a club record that stands to this day. He kept 23 clean sheets in his 38 games, which included a quite incredible 20 from his side's opening 27 games of the campaign\nHardy held the club's individual goalkeeping record for not conceding a goal for an amazing 85 years til it was beaten by current Welsh International goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey. When Blackpool's Barrass scored a 77-minute goal at Edgeley Park on 30 April 1921 Hardy was not beaten again until Tommy Robson scored an own goal at Southport on 8 October 1921 \u2013 755 minutes later.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stockport County F.C.", "response": ["The 1920\u201321 campaign saw Stockport finish bottom of the Second Division; however, instead of facing re-election, they were placed in the new Third Division North.

His feat also means he now holds County's record for the longest period without conceding a goal, beating Harry Hardy's 85-year-old record. His record now stands at 857 minutes, from the start of his competitive club debut, against Boston United on 13 January 2007, until Oliver Allen of Barnet scored on 10 March 2007.

In the next quarter of an hour, the Professionals hit the frame of the goal three times. On the first occasion, Benjamin Howard Baker rushed out of goal but failed to collect Ernie Simms' shot; the ball struck the foot of the post, and Gates was able to clear before it spun back into the net. Then a shot from Jimmy Walsh and a volley by Jack Elkes each struck a post, rebounded into play, and were cleared by the defence. Soon afterwards, Simms suffered a leg strain. He played on, limping on the wing, until half-time, but took no part in the second half. After 35 minutes, Ashton scored his second goal, in similar fashion to the first; he trapped Bellamy's cross and shot hard into the corner. In what remained of the first half, Frank Macey had two close-range shots, \"but both were saved most brilliantly\" by Harry Hardy.", "|Goalkeeper|| Harry Hardy||Stockport County"]}]}}
