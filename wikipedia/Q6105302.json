D. Rees triggered a by-election  in the Nottingham East constituency. He was selected as the Coalition Unionist candidate (i.e. a Conservative standing in the support of the coalition government led by the Liberal David Lloyd George). After a campaign described by The Times newspaper as \"strenuous\", Houfton won the seat with 52% of the votes, and a majority of 4,973 (25%) over the second-placed Labour Co-operative candidate. He was re-elected at the general election in December 1922, but was defeated at the 1923 general election by the Liberal candidate Norman Birkett."]}]}}
