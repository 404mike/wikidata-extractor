He wrote the 1970 documentary film London Rock, focusing on the UK's counterculture movement. He recalls that, together with Rolling Stone journalists David Dalton and Jonathan Cott, he joined Granada Television documentary-makers such as Jo Durden-Smith, John Sheppard and Michael Darlow in devising \"prime-time networked shows designed as anthems of the revolution\". Among these late-1960s projects, he says that the Johnny Cash at San Quentin TV special was his idea, and he \"share[s] credit\" for the ideas behind the concert films The Doors Are Open and The Stones in the Park. He also directed the film of Frank Zappa's performance at the 1970 Palermo Pop Festival, for RAI, Italy's national public broadcaster."]}, {"page": "The Doors Are Open", "response": ["The Doors Are Open is a 1968 black-and-white documentary about the American rock group the Doors.
