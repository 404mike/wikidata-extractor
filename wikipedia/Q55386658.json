In a survey by Shelter 40% of private renters said they had reduced clothes buying, 37% had used benefits meant for living costs to pay rent, more than a third had reduced spending on food, 28% had reduced heating, and a third had sold possessions.  The housing benefit freeze may continue after other benefits are unfrozen.  Polly Neate of Shelter said, \u201cThe freeze on housing benefit is pushing families into poverty and homelessness. People are being forced into desperate measures to pay their rent from selling their possessions and borrowing money to skipping meals.  Politicians kicking [the housing benefit freeze decision] into the long grass means too many families will struggle through the winter, weighing up whether to pay their heating bill or their rent.\u201dBenefit-rent gap for poorest tenants widens to \u00a3113 a month The Guardian"]}]}}
