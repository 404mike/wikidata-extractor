In 1985 when the band was on hold, he recorded two singles with his longtime writing partner Bernie Frost. The single releases were \"Modern Romance (I Want to Fall in Love Again)\" (UK No. 54), and \"Jealousy\". In 1996 he issued a solo album, King of the Doghouse, which was not a commercial success, although it produced a UK No. 42 single, \"Give Myself to Love\". Some years earlier, in 1976, he had appeared on the soundtrack album and film All This and World War II comprising cover versions of songs by the Beatles. Although the album sleeve credits the performance of \"Getting Better\" to Status Quo, the track featured Rossi's vocals and the London Symphony Orchestra. In 1977, he produced and played guitar on John Du Cann's solo album The World's Not Big Enough. 3 May 2010 saw the release of his second solo album, One Step at a Time, including a re-recording of Quo's 1973 single \"Caroline\"."]}, {"page": "Pete Kircher", "response": ["The next excursion for Kircher's drumming was as a member of the band Shanghai, where he joined Mick Green from Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. The band produced two albums, released in 1974 and 1976, when the band supported Status Quo on the Blue for You tour. This, in turn, directly led to Kircher's induction into a group of session musicians for John Du Cann's The World's Not Big Enough album in 1977, which was produced by Quo's guitarist Francis Rossi."]}]}}
