After receiving his art education, he painted some portraits but landscapes soon became his preferred subject. He exhibited at several venues in England and also in Paris. Batley regularly submitted work to the Royal Academy, and he was a founding member of the Ipswich Fine Art Club. He enjoyed travelling and painting throughout England but East Anglia remained his favourite locale. Starting in the 1890s, his method of painting evolved towards a freer and more atmospheric style. His work is held in three public collections, and a retrospective was mounted in 1988 at Christchurch Mansion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Walter Daniel Batley (1850\u20131936)"]}, {"page": "List of English people", "response": ["* Walter Daniel Batley (1850\u20131936), painter"]}, {"page": "Walter Batley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Walter Daniel Batley"]}]}}
