He replaced club legend Roy Sproson, and was given a large war chest to spend after a successful lottery scheme was set up at Vale Park. He took over with the club in 21st place in the Third Division. His first game in charge was a 0\u20130 draw with Midland Counties League side Arnold in the First Round of the FA Cup. In January, veteran defender Graham Hawkins was signed as a player-coach from Blackburn Rovers for \u00a36,000. Forward Neville Chamberlain also joined the club as a professional, becoming the club's first black pro. John Froggatt also joined the club, signing from Colchester United for \u00a310,000. Chairman Arthur McPherson celebrated this abandonment of frugality by declaring \"we are going places\". Local journalist Chris Harper slated the board for their decisions, calling them 'berserk'. Froggatt scored fifteen seconds into his debut in a 4\u20130 win over Exeter City. However this would be as good as it got for both Froggatt and Vale that season. In February, Vale beat Fort Lauderdale Strikers in a friendly, but also started a five games sequence without a win. Ged Stenson arrived the next month from Everton for a 'bargain' \u00a33,000, and John Lumsdon joined on loan from Stoke City. Vale improved, and were unbeaten in six of their seven March games, with Chamberlain scoring on his debut. Yet on 28 March they started a club-record streak of twelve home games without a win that would continue into the following season. Encouragement came from the youth side, who reached the Quarter Finals of the FA Youth Cup. With four games to go, Vale were one point clear of the drop, however by losing all of their remaining games the \"Valiants\" ended the 1977\u201378 season in 21st place and were relegated into the Fourth Division.

Alan Bloor took over as caretaker manager, who threatened the players with a place on the bench if they failed to deliver in the first eleven, to prove his point he replaced Bernie Wright with Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain rewarded him with both goals in a 2\u20130 victory over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. A 5\u20130 thrashing of Northampton Town followed eight days later, with both Chamberlain and Wright claiming a brace. However the following week they were 'massacred' 7\u20131 at high-flying Huddersfield Town's Leeds Road. Despite this, Trevor Dance retained his place in goal, with John Connaughton 'in a huff' with the club. By the end of September, Bloor was made manager on a permanent basis.
