David's greatest disappointment during this time was his inability to ensure control of the bishopric of Durham and the archbishopric of York. David had attempted to appoint his chancellor, William Comyn, to the bishopric of Durham, which had been vacant since the death of Bishop Geoffrey Rufus in 1140. Between 1141 and 1143, Comyn was the de facto bishop, and had control of the bishop's castle; but he was resented by the chapter. Despite controlling the town of Durham, David's only hope of ensuring his election and consecration was gaining the support of the Papal legate, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen. Despite obtaining the support of the Empress Matilda, David was unsuccessful and had given up by the time William de St Barbara was elected to the see in 1143.For David's struggle for control over Durham see Oram, David, pp. 169\u201375."]}, {"page": "Durham Cathedral", "response": ["*Geoffrey Rufus, also in the chapter house (where his grave was also excavated in the 19th century)"]}, {"page": "List of Lord Chancellors and Lord Keepers", "response": ["*Geoffrey Rufus (1123\u20131133)"]}]}}
