In 1786 John Bacon, having changed the title of the book to Liber Regis and made a few additions, published it as entirely his own work, without even revising Ecton's preface. He himself did not add one line of introduction, as is erroneously stated in Nichols's Literary Anecdotes, ix. 5n. This conduct, for which Bacon and his publisher, John Nichols, deserved equal blame, was severely commented on in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1786 and 1787 (vol. lvi. pt. ii. 1027\u20138, vol. lvii. pt. i. pp.\u00a0135, 304\u20135)."]}]}}
