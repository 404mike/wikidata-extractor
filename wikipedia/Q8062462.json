She drew the \"Roy of the Rovers\" strip in Tiger from 1967 to 1975, and again in 1976\u201378, as well as a number of back-up strips in Roy of the Rovers weekly, including \"Durrell's Palace\" (1981\u201385), \"Wayne's Wolves\" (1985\u201386) \"Kevin's Chance\" (1986\u201387) \"City\" (1987\u201388), and \"Terrible Twins\" (1988\u201389). She also drew the Roy of the Rovers daily strip in the Daily Star until she had a car accident in December 1991, which eventually resulted in her death three months later in March 1992. Her final Roy of the Rovers strip was published in the Star on 17th January 1992.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cartoonists", "response": ["* Yvonne Hutton"]}, {"page": "Roy of the Rovers", "response": ["At the peak of the comic's success, about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was serialised in the now-defunct Today newspaper. The strip concluded abruptly, mid-story, on 29 August 1987. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. A new strip was launched in the Daily Star on 13 November 1989,\"I\u2019m Over the Moon to be Joining the Star\" Daily Star 13 November 1989 written by regular writer Tom Tully and drawn by veteran Roy artist Yvonne Hutton. Hutton's final Roy of the Rovers artwork appeared on 17 January 1992, with Mike Western debuting on the art the following day. The strip concluded on 14 May 1993, two months after the cancellation of the weekly comic. Between 1988 and 1993, a Best of Roy of the Rovers monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.", "After Joe Colquhoun departed, he was succeeded first by Paul Trevillion, then by Yvonne Hutton, who illustrated from 1967 to 1974, before David Sque took over in 1975. Despite reportedly not being a football fan, he was responsible for one of the strip's more definitive looks in its early '80s period. He was replaced in 1986 by former 2000\u00a0AD artist Mike White, who gave Roy a more muscular look and the strip a more modern feel. Barrie Mitchell took over in 1992, with a style quite similar to White's.Rob Davis on Roy of the Rovers Monthly, Dinlos and Skilldos, 19 March 2009 A number of artists worked on the monthly comic, such as David Jukes, Sean Longcroft and Garry Marshall, in contrast to the lengthy tenures of the weekly strip's creative team. Tony Harding often illustrated Roy for the Roy of the Rovers annuals and also drew the Roy's Action Replay strip that appeared in All Action Monthly in the late eighties (Fleetway). Mitchell returned in 1997 as the sole artist of the Match of the Day strips for all four years."]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Yvonne Hutton (1941\u20131991)"]}]}}
