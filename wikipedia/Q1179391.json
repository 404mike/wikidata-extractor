Bell has been inducted into both the English Football Hall of Fame and the Manchester City Hall of Fame. In 1998 he was selected as one of the Football League 100 Legends. In his foreword to Colin Bell's autobiography, Bobby Charlton has stated that \"Colin Bell was unquestionably a great player\". Alan Mullery, another of Bell's former England teammates stated that Bell would \"still be a star in today's football\" and \"would fit into any team\". Another England teammate of Bell's, Kevin Keegan, has stated that Bell \"had it all\". England legend Tom Finney stated that \"Colin Bell was as good as anything I've ever seen\". George Best described Bell as a \"brilliant player\". Joe Royle described Bell as a \"phenomenal natural athlete\" and \"a wonderful footballer\". Journalist Dave Maddock described Bell as \"possibly the greatest midfield talent England has ever unearthed\". In 2003, Manchester City moved into the new City of Manchester Stadium, and in February 2004, one of the ends, the west stand, was named after Bell as a tribute. Only three players have scored more goals than Bell for Manchester City in all competitions: Sergio Ag\u00fcero with 252 goals, Eric Brook with 177 goals and Tommy Johnson with 166 goals. Bell scored 152 goals for Manchester City in all competitions. He was deemed by Goal.com to be England's twenty-sixth best-ever footballer.  He is listed as the greatest-ever City player on the Times website, in Ian Penney's book The Essential History of Manchester City, and in the Manchester Evening News."]}]}}
