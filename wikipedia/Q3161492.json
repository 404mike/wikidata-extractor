Reports by some early European explorers including Quir\u00f3s include attempts to trascribe notable Tahitian words heard during initial interactions with the indigenous people of Marquesa. Aboard the Endeavour, Lt. James Cook and the ship's master, Robert Molyneux, transcribed the names of 72 and 55 islands respectively as recited by the Tahitian arioi, Tupaia. Many of these were \"non-geographic\" or \"ghost islands\" of Polynesian mythology and all were transcribed using phonetic English spelling. In 1797, Protestant missionaries arrived in Tahiti on a British ship called Duff, captained by James Wilson. Among the missionaries was Henry Nott (1774\u20131844) who learned the Tahitian language and worked with P\u014dmare II, a Tahitian king, and the Welsh missionary, John Davies (1772-1855), to translate the Bible into Tahitian. A system of five vowels and nine consonants was adopted for the Tahitian Bible, which would become the key text by which many Polynesians would learn to read and write. John Davies's spelling book (1810) was the first book to be printed in the Tahitian language. He also published a grammar and a dictionary of that language."]}, {"page": "James Wilson", "response": ["James Wilson may refer to:", "*James Wilson (Upper Canada politician) (1770\u20131847), English-born farmer and political figure in Upper Canada", "*James Wilson (Ontario MPP) (1810\u20131891), Canadian politician", "*James Wilson (New South Wales politician, born 1862) (1862\u20131925), English-born Australian politician", "*James Wilson (New South Wales politician, born 1865) (1865\u20131927), New Zealand-born Australian politician", "*Sir James Wilson (New Zealand politician, born 1849) (1849\u20131929), New Zealand politician and farmer", "*James Wilson (New Zealand politician, born 1814) (1814\u20131898)", "*James Wilson (MP for York) between 1826 and 1830.", "*James Wilson (Labour politician) (1879\u20131943), British MP for Dudley and Oldham", "*James Wilson (businessman) (1805\u20131860), UK member of parliament and founder of The Economist magazine", "*James Wilson (Orangeman) (fl. 1793\u201394), North Irish politician, founder of the Orange Institution", "*James Wilson (Founding Father) (1742\u20131798), Founding father of the United States", "*James Wilson (Colorado politician), former member of the Colorado House of Representatives", "*James Wilson (Indiana politician) (1825\u20131867), US Representative", "*James Wilson I (New Hampshire politician) (1766\u20131839), US Representative", "*James Wilson II (New Hampshire politician) (1797\u20131881), US Representative, son of James Wilson I", "*James Wilson (Pennsylvania politician) (1779\u20131868), US Representative", "*James Wilson (Secretary of Agriculture) (1835\u20131920), United States Secretary of Agriculture and US Representative from Iowa", "*James Wilson (journalist) (1787\u20131850), Irish-American journalist, politician, and judge", "*James Wilson (British Army officer) (1921\u20132004), British general", "*James Wilson (explorer) (1760\u20131814), brought the first British missionaries to Tahiti", "*James Wilson (Irish nationalist) (1836\u20131921), Irish republican convicted of desertion", "*James Wilson (revolutionary) (1760\u20131820), Scottish leader of the Radical War", "*James Wilson (athlete) (1891\u20131973), British athlete", "*James Wilson (Australian rules footballer) (c. 1855\u20131935), Australian rules footballer for Geelong", "*James Wilson (basketball), American basketball player", "*James Wilson (cricketer) (born 1978), South African cricketer", "*James Wilson (darts player) (born 1972), English darts player", "*James Wilson (footballer, born 1866) (c. 1866\u20131900), Scottish footballer", "*James Wilson (footballer, born 1882), Scottish footballer (St Mirren, Preston NE)", "*James Wilson (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131934), Australian rules footballer for Essendon", "*James Wilson (footballer, born 1890) (1890\u20131917), Scottish footballer (Queen's Park)", "*James Wilson (Welsh footballer) (born 1989), Welsh professional footballer with Plymouth Argyle", "*James Wilson (English footballer) (born 1995), English professional footballer for Port Vale", "*James Wilson (1910s footballer), English footballer", "*James Wilson (rugby union) (born 1983), New Zealand rugby player", "*James Wilson (trainer) (1828\u20131917), founder of St. Albans Stud, Victoria, Australia", "*James Wilson (trainer) (c. 1858\u20131935), founder Bonny Vale Stud, Victoria, Australia", "* James Wilson (anatomist) (1765\u20131821), Scottish anatomist", "*James Wilson (scientist), American gene therapist", "* James Wilson (zoologist) (1795\u20131856), Scottish zoologist", "*James Wilson (mathematician) (1774?\u20131829), Irish mathematician", "*James Wilson (architect) (1816\u20131900), British architect in Bath", "*James Wilson (cinematographer) (active 1927\u20131963), British cinematographer", "*James Wilson (composer) (1922\u20132005), Irish composer", "*James Wilson (globe maker) (1763\u20131855), American globe maker", "*James Wilson (songwriter), 18th-century English songwriter", "*Mark Wilson (magician) or James Wilson (born 1929), American magician", "*James Wilson (Archdeacon of Manchester) (1836\u20131931), British theologian and science teacher", "*James Wilson (bishop) (died 1857), Irish bishop of Cork", "*James Wilson (Dean of Elphin and Ardagh), Irish Anglican clergyman", "*James Wilson (Dean of Tuam), Irish Anglican clergyman", "*James Wilson (civil servant) (1853\u20131926), British civil servant in British India", "*James Wilson (House), a character on House", "*James Wilson (motorcyclist) (c. 1901\u20131995), long-distance motorcyclist and author"]}, {"page": "Rikitea", "response": ["The town's history dates to the era when the island was first settled with people from the Marquesas Islands in 1100 AD.
