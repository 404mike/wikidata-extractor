Many wealthy wool merchants added to the town's heritage. John Greenway (1460\u20131529), for example, built a chapel and porch onto St Peter's parish church in 1517, and a small chapel and almshouses in Gold Street, which still stand \u2013 the Almshouse Trust still houses people today. Peter Blundell, another wealthy merchant, who died in 1601, bequeathed the funds and land for Blundell's School to educate local children. It was founded in Tiverton in 1604 and relocated to its present location on the outskirts of town in 1882, where it functions as an independent school.Martin Dunsford, Historical Memoirs of Tiverton (Brice, Exeter, 1790) John Waldron (died 1579) founded Waldron's Almshouses, on Wellbrook Street, and his elaborate chest tomb survives in St Peter's Church.", "The town enjoyed prosperity from the wool trade in the early 18th century. However, a period of decline followed during the early Industrial Revolution. There were occasional riots, and societies of woolcombers and weavers were formed in an effort to protect jobs and wages. By the end of the century, imports of cotton and the expansion of industrialization elsewhere, along with the effect of the Napoleonic Wars on exports, took the town's woollen industry into terminal decline.Martin Dunsford, Historical Memoirs of Tiverton (Brice, Exeter, 1790) In June 1731 another fire destroyed 298 houses, causing \u00a358,000 worth of damage.

The promontory of land that links Cranmore to the edge of Newtes Hill is traversed by the old Exeter Road, which travels past the earthwork on its way from Tiverton to Exeter. The hill and road have latterly been known as Exeter Hill, and this road almost certainly follows the path of a prehistoric trackway.", "During the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549 Cranmore Castle became the site of a fierce battle fought between the two sides over whether a child should be baptised according to the 'new' religion or the 'old'. The battle took place near a small chapel that stood at one corner of the site, near the road. The chapel was demolished in the 17th century, and in 1687 bones and musket shots thought to be from the battle were discovered.Martin Dunsford, Historical Memoirs of Tiverton (Brice, Exeter, 1790), p. 197."]}, {"page": "Tiverton Castle", "response": ["During the Civil War the Castle was a Royalist stronghold.

The Culverin, the largest artillery piece used by the New Model Army, was capable of firing up to 2,000\u00a0yards.Stuart Asquith, New Model Army 1645-60 (Opsprey Publishing ) Whilst they were still finding their range a lucky shot hit one of the chains holding up the Castle's drawbridge and a small party of roundheads were able swiftly to gain entry and thus put an end to the siege almost before it had started.
