The inaugural match, on 31 August 1935 against West Ham United, ended in a 4\u20133 victory for the home team and set a new record attendance of 29,779. The biggest highlight of the following four seasons was the visit of King George VI to Carrow Road on 29 October 1938. However the club was relegated to the Third Division at the end of the season. The league was suspended the following season due to the Second World War, and did not resume until the 1946\u201347 season. City finished this and the following season in 21st place, the poor results forcing the club to apply for re-election to the league. The club narrowly missed out on promotion under the guidance of manager Norman Low in the early 1950s, but following the return of Tom Parker as manager, Norwich finished bottom of the football league in the 1956\u201357 season.", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Tom Parker"]}, {"page": "Herbert Chapman", "response": ["In February 1926, he signed the pacy winger Joe Hulme, followed that summer by forward Jack Lambert and full-back Tom Parker, who would later succeed Buchan as captain.
