The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the round window. For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.Nikolaus Pevsner, An Outline of European Architecture, Pelican, 1964, ISBN unknown", "Michelangelo takes all Brunelleschi\u2019s components and bends them to his will.

It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened by the items that they saw in the Great Exhibition of 1851, which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial, and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used. Art historian Nikolaus Pevsner writes that the exhibits showed \"ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface\", as well as displaying \"vulgarity in detail\". Design reform began with Exhibition organizers Henry Cole (1808\u20131882), Owen Jones (1809\u20131874), Matthew Digby Wyatt (1820\u20131877), and Richard Redgrave (1804\u20131888), all of whom deprecated excessive ornament and impractical or badly made things. The organizers were \"unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits.\" Owen Jones, for example, complained that \"the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter\" produced \"novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence.\" From these criticisms of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's Supplementary Report on Design (1852) analysed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for \"more logic in the application of decoration.\" Other works followed in a similar vein, such as Wyatt's Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century (1853), Gottfried Semper's Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst (\"Science, Industry and Art\") (1852), Ralph Wornum's Analysis of Ornament (1856), Redgrave's Manual of Design (1876), and Jones's Grammar of Ornament (1856). The Grammar of Ornament was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.", "Jones declared that ornament \"must be secondary to the thing decorated\", that there must be \"fitness in the ornament to the thing ornamented\", and that wallpapers and carpets must not have any patterns \"suggestive of anything but a level or plain\".Quoted in Nikolaus Pevsner, Pioneers of Modern Design A fabric or wallpaper in the Great Exhibition might be decorated with a natural motif made to look as real as possible, whereas these writers advocated flat and simplified natural motifs. Redgrave insisted that \"style\" demanded sound construction before ornamentation, and a proper awareness of the quality of materials used. \"Utility must have precedence over ornamentation.\"", "The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society held eleven exhibitions between 1888 and 1916. By the outbreak of war in 1914 it was in decline and faced a crisis. Its 1912 exhibition had been a financial failure.Tania Harrod, The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century, Yale University Press, 1999.  While designers in continental Europe were making innovations in design and alliances with industry through initiatives such as the Deutsche Werkbund and new initiatives were being taken in Britain by the Omega Workshops and the Design in Industries Association, the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, now under the control of an old guard, was withdrawing from commerce and collaboration with manufacturers into purist handwork and what Tania Harrod describes as \"decommoditisation\" Its rejection of a commercial role has been seen as a turning point in its fortunes.
