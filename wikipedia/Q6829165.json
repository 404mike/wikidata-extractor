This began to change in 1920 when Bernard Leach established the Leach Pottery at St. Ives in Cornwall and in 1925 William Staite Murray became pottery tutor at the Royal College of Art. In contrast to Leach and his followers, who mainly made wheel-thrown pots, Wren used a wide variety of techniques such as building with slabs or coils of clay and making tiles and figurines in moulds: partly inspired by her lessons from Archibald Knox. Denise Wren's early pots were often incised with Celtic designs inspired by Archibald Knox. Wren also used commercially produced glazes, though often in an experimental way. Ceramicists like Denise Wren were part of a new aesthetic movement that began to emerge after the First World War. 'British Studio Potters' -men and women working alone or in small workshops designing and making pots and figurines. Wren's technical understanding of ceramic work was demonstrated at a meeting of the Craft Potters Association in 1960 where she produced a detailed scheme of categories against which a pot's quality could be judged. Each category was in turn, comprehensive: one contained 87 questions. Michael Casson referred to it as 'a brilliant piece of planning'."]}]}}
