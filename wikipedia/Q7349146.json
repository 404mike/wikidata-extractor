From 1915-1918 during the First World War, Rait worked at the War Trade Intelligence Department in London, and was awarded a CBE in 1918. In 1919, he was appointed Historiographer Royal of Scotland, a member of the Royal Household in Scotland, also serving for a time as dean of the Faculty of Arts in the university. He became a prominent figure in the intellectual and cultural life of the city, frequently contributing letters and articles to the Glasgow Herald, often anonymously. Rait's research generally maintained a Scottish focus, with particular reference to the politics of pre-Union Scotland and its relationship with England. He published History of Scotland in 1914, The Parliaments of Scotland in 1924, Critical Moments in British History in 1925 and King James's Secret in 1927.
