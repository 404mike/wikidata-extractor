Although he had never climbed big walls, she felt at ease around him and both had a background in traditional climbing; they both shared a desire to free climb The Nose and agreed within hours of meeting to try the feat together. Their attempt to free climb The Nose failed. Four years later, in 1993, together with her partner Brooke Sandahl, she became the first person, male or female, to free climb the route. Hill's original climbing grade for the \"Free Nose\" was 5.13b. One of the most difficult pitches\u2014Changing Corners\u2014she rated at a 5.13b/c, but she wrote in her autobiography that \"rating the difficulty of such a pitch is almost impossible\" and \"the most accurate grade would be to call it 'once, or maybe twice, in a lifetime'\". The rock face is nearly blank and there are next to no holds; to ascend the section, Hill had to use a \"carefully coordinated sequence of opposite pressures between [her] feet, hands, elbows, and hips against the shallow walls of the corner\" as well as turn her body completely around."]}, {"page": "Sportroccia", "response": ["|  Simon Nadin"]}, {"page": "IFSC Climbing World Cup", "response": ["|  Simon Nadin"]}]}}
