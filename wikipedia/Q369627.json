He retired in 2007. He is a prolific writer of popular chemistry textbooks, including Physical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, and Molecular Quantum Mechanics.

As the second law of thermodynamics shows, in an isolated system internal portions at different temperatures tend to adjust to a single uniform temperature and thus produce equilibrium. A recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of energy as dispersal, which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics (compare discussion in next section). Physical chemist Peter Atkins, in his textbook Physical Chemistry, introduces entropy with the statement that \"spontaneous changes are always accompanied by a dispersal of energy or matter and often both\"."]}, {"page": "Relationship between religion and science", "response": ["Events in Europe such as the Galileo affair of the early 17th century, associated with the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, led scholars such as John William Draper to postulate () a conflict thesis, suggesting that religion and science have been in conflict methodologically, factually and politically throughout history. Some contemporary philosophers and scientists (such as Richard Dawkins, Lawrence Krauss, Peter Atkins, and Donald Prothero) subscribe to this thesis. However, the conflict thesis has lost favor among most contemporary historians of science.", "According to Guillermo Paz-y-Mi\u00f1o-C and Avelina Espinosa, the historical conflict between evolution and religion is intrinsic to the incompatibility between scientific rationalism/empiricism and the belief in supernatural causation. According to evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne, views on evolution and levels of religiosity in some countries, along with the existence of books explaining reconciliation between evolution and religion, indicate that people have trouble in believing both at the same time, thus implying incompatibility. In a debate with John Staddon, Coyne disputed the idea that the values of secular humanism are just as faith-based as frankly religious beliefs. According to physical chemist Peter Atkins, \"whereas religion scorns the power of human comprehension, science respects it.\" Planetary scientist Carolyn Porco describes a hope that \"the confrontation between science and formal religion will come to an end when the role played by science in the lives of all people is the same played by religion today.\""]}, {"page": "Solubility equilibrium", "response": ["This differential expression for a non-electrolyte can be integrated on a temperature interval to give:Peter Atkins, Physical Chemistry, p. 153 (8th edition)"]}, {"page": "Second law of thermodynamics", "response": ["* The Second Law of Thermodynamics, BBC Radio 4 discussion with John Gribbin, Peter Atkins & Monica Grady (In Our Time, Dec. 16, 2004)"]}, {"page": "Rupert Sheldrake", "response": ["In 2006, Sheldrake spoke at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science about experimental results on telepathy replicated by \"a 1980s girl band,\" drawing criticism from Peter Atkins, Lord Winston, and Richard Wiseman.

The same interpretation had been advanced some years previously by Peter Atkins. In this interpretation, the various approximations that constitute our current physics theories are successful because simple mathematical structures can provide good approximations of certain aspects of more complex mathematical structures. In other words, our successful theories are not mathematics approximating physics, but simple mathematics approximating more complex mathematics."]}, {"page": "Effusion", "response": ["as v_{\\rm avg}=\\sqrt{8/3\\pi}\\ v_{\\rm rms}\\approx 0.921\\ v_{\\rm rms} (or, equivalently, v_{\\rm rms}=\\sqrt{3\\pi/8}\\ v_{\\rm avg}\\approx 1.085\\ v_{\\rm avg}).
