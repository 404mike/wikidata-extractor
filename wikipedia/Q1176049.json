F. Foster wrote that \"the game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian game of As-Nas.\" However, in the 1990s the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As-Nas began to be challenged by gaming historians including David Parlett. What is certain, however, is that poker was popularised in the American South in the early 19th century, as gambling riverboats in the Mississippi River and around New Orleans during the 1830s helped spread the game. One early description of poker played on a steamboat in 1829 is recorded by the English actor, Joe Cowell. The game was played with twenty cards ranking from Ace (high) to Ten (low).Cowell (1844), p. 94."]}, {"page": "Cut (cards)", "response": ["According to David Parlett, until the 20th century it was usual for the player cutting the lowest card to deal first.

The oldest known \"trumps\" appear in Karn\u00f6ffel, where specific ranks of one suit were named Karn\u00f6ffel, Devil, Pope etc. and subject to an elaborate system of trumping powers. Around 1440 in Italy,  special cards called trionfi were introduced with a similar function. These special cards are now known as tarots, and a deck augmented by tarots as a tarot deck. The trionfi/tarots formed essentially a fifth suit without the ordinary ranks but consisting of trumps in a fixed hierarchy. But one can get a similar effect by declaring all cards of a fixed or randomly determined suit to be trumps. This method, originating with Triomphe, is still followed by a number of modern trick-taking games that do not involve an auction.. Trumps were retroactively added to some games, such as Trappola. It is much rarer for trumps to be removed.McLeod, John. K\u00f6nigrufen (Graden) at pagat.com. Retrieved 25 January 2016. The invention of trumps became so popular that very few European trick-taking games exist without them.

Its name and rules suggest it may have been brought over by sailors returning from Asia where similar card games have been played since the early 17th century such as San zhang, Oicho-Kabu, and Gabo japgi. Macao appeared in Europe at the end of the 18th century and was popular for all classes. Its notoriety led to King Victor-Amadeus III banning it in all his realms in 1788. It was the most popular game in Watier's, an exclusive gentlemen's club in London, where it led to the ruin of Beau Brummell. The match in Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Night Games (Spiel im Morgengrauen) contains instructions for Macao under the name of baccarat.
