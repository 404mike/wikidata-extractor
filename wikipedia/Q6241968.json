Waubojeeg was cautious, as he had seen other white traders later abandon their native wives, and told Johnston to return to Montreal, and if he returned to Chequamegon in the spring, Waubojeeg would consider his proposal. Johnston returned and Waubojeeg agreed to the marriage. Ozhaguscodaywayquay married John Johnston in 1793. However, it appears she was not consulted, as after the marriage she ran off to her grandfather, however her father found her, beat her with a stick, threatened to cut off her ear, and returned her to Johnston. Waubojeeg's motives for his actions are unclear as neither compelled marriage nor violence enforcing it appear typical of Ojibwe marriages or Ojibwe fur-trade marriages. Ojibwe marriages could be dissolved at will by either partner by simply walking out, and Ozhaguscodaywayquay seemed to have been troubled by the implication of a marriage \"till death\", which was the norm with Europeans at the time (British divorce laws were not liberalized until 1967-until then, divorce was very difficult to obtain in Britain and throughout the British Empire).", "Under the Treaty of Ghent which ended the War of 1812, the U.S. no longer allowed British traders and trappers to move freely across the border between the U.S. and the British colony of Upper Canada.

John served as a captain with the British and was part of the British and native forces that surprised that Americans took Mackinac Island in 1812. After the War of 1812, Johnston retained his status as a British subject, even though he continued to live with his family in the United States. From 1814 to 1816 he served as a British civil magistrate and justice of the peace for the Indian territories. He never became an American citizen, and participated in the fur trade through his son's American citizenship, since they were born within American borders. Lewis, the oldest son, had served with the Royal Navy against the U.S. Taken prisoner during the war, he suffered poor treatment by US forces and rejected living under U.S. rule.
