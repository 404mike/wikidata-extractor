Marie when it was still Canadian territory  before the War of 1812. He was a prominent citizen and leader in the Michigan Territory of the United States, although he never became a US citizen.  He married Ozhaguscodaywayquay (Woman of the Green Glade), daughter of Waubojeeg (White Fisher), a prominent Ojibwe war chief and civil leader from what is now northern Wisconsin. The Johnstons were leaders in both the Euro-American and Ojibwa communities. Johnston's life was markedly disrupted by the War of 1812, as afterward the U.S. prohibited trading by Canadians in its territory.", "link_mentions": {}}}
