From the mid-nineteenth century, portrait painting, particularity the miniature, declined as an art, photography also began to influence painting. Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, Robert Scott Lauder, William Quiller Orchardson and John Pettie. In the twentieth century the move away from figurative painting to impressionism and abstraction, speeded the decline of portrait painting. Artists who continued to pursue portraiture included Francis Cadell, Cecile Walton, Dorothy Johnstone and James Cowie. The second half of the twentieth century saw a general movement back towards figurative representation. Alexander Moffat was among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s. The artists associated with Moffat known as the \"new Glasgow Boys\" included Steven Campbell, Peter Howson, Ken Currie and Adrian Wisniewski. A parallel movement in Edinburgh, focused around the 369 Gallery in the city, included Caroline McNairn, Robert MacLaurin and Gwen Hardie.", "In the twentieth century, the move away from figurative painting to impressionism and abstraction continued the decline of portrait painting.J. Barzun, The Use and Abuse of Art (Princeton University Press, 1975), , p. 55. The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the four members of the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland.I. Chilvers, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), , p. 575. Of their number Francis Cadell (1883\u20131937), emerged as a significant painter of still lives and single figure compositions, particularly with interior backdrops, before moving closer to abstraction.MacDonald, Scottish Art, p. 160. Of the next significant movement, known as The Edinburgh School, Cecile Walton (1891\u20131956) referenced classical forms, particularly in her ironic self-portrait Romance (1920), which draws on Titian's Venus of Urbino and Manet's Olympia. Her close friend Dorothy Johnstone's portraits, such as the young girl in September Sunlight (1916), made use of interior natural light.MacDonald, Scottish Art, p. 168. The work of James Cowie (1886\u20131956), who painted a number of girls in interior settings, is similar in theme to that of Johnstone, but had a more distant and elegiac feel that can be seen in Falling Leaves (1934), which has been read as a commentary as a commentary on the transition from childhood to adolescence.MacDonald, Scottish Art, p. 174."]}, {"page": "Edinburgh University Women's Union", "response": ["As the number of female students rose in the early part of the 19th century, the original premises became unsuitable.

Her father, landscape artist George Whitton Johnstone RSA (1849\u20131901), encouraged her artistic talents, and at the age of 16 she enrolled as a student at the Edinburgh College of Art. She took the Life Class with Ernest Stephen Lumsden where she revealed her talents at informal portraiture, a genre for which she became well known. In 1914 she became a member of staff at the Edinburgh College of Art. From the summer of 1915, she became a regular annual visitor to Kirkcudbright in Galloway, where she would paint with other mainly female artists including Jessie M. King as part of the Kirkcudbright School.Kirkcudbright - 100 Years of an Artists' Colony by Patrick Bourne, Publisher: Atelier Books 2000  Dorothy Johnstone, with her close friends Cecile Walton and Mary Newbery, was a member of The Edinburgh School, which reformed in 1919, a collective of gifted and progressive artists associated with the Edinburgh College of Art.

As a consequence of her husband's appointment in 1933 as head of Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen (now at Robert Gordon's University) and of the marriage bar in place at the time, she gave up her career and her students.

Jessie M King had purchased her property \u2018Greengate\u2019 and its close in 1909, probably with the encouragement of E A Hornel. By this time Kirkcudbright\u2019s reputation as an artistic centre had been reinforced by the arrival of artists such as William Robson (1863-1950) from Capri via Edinburgh in 1904; Charles Oppenheimer (1875-1961) from Manchester in 1908; William Hanna Clarke (1882-1924) in 1914 from Glasgow; to be followed by David Sassoon (1888-1978) in the early 1920s. The Taylors had taught in Paris before the First World War and had become friends with the Scottish Colourist, S J Peploe (1871-1935), who regularly visited them in Kirkcudbright from 1918. The Taylors\u2019 reputation as teachers was such that Robert Burns, Head of Painting at Edinburgh College of Art, actively encouraged his students to study with them. This introduced a younger generation of Edinburgh artists to Kirkcudbright, including Anne Redpath (1895-1965), Dorothy Nesbitt (1893-1974), Dorothy Johnstone (1892-1980), E A Walton\u2019s daughter Cecile Walton (1891-1956), A R Sturrock (1885-1953) and William Miles Johnston (1893-1974). At the same time Glasgow-based artists and craft workers visited and stayed with the Taylors in Greengate Close or elsewhere in the town, including Helen S Johnstone (1888-1931) originally from Troon, and the metalworker Agnes Harvey (1874-1947) and jeweller Mary Thew (1876-1953).
