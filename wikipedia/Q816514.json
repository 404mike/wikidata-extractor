He is one of two Jewish athletes known to have competed in the Olympics after surviving the Holocaust, although according to the definition of 'surviving the Holocaust' there could also be others, such as Susie Halter (originally Zsuzsa N\u00e1dor) who escaped from a forced march on her way to a slave labour camp and then survived in hiding in Budapest. Helfgott has spent his adult life promoting Holocaust education, meeting with national leaders in the UK to promote cultural integration and peace.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Polish people", "response": ["* Ben Helfgott"]}, {"page": "Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski", "response": ["* Ben Helfgott (1929-), Polish-born British weightlifter"]}, {"page": "List of Polish Jews", "response": ["* Ben Helfgott, Polish-born, three-time British champion (lightweight), three-time Maccabiah champion; survived Buchenwald and Theresienstadt; all but one family member was murdered by the Nazis"]}, {"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Ben Helfgott, Polish-born British, three-time British champion (lightweight), three-time Maccabiah champion; survived Buchenwald and Theresienstadt concentration camps, as all but one other of his family were killed by the Nazis"]}, {"page": "Ben", "response": ["*Ben Helfgott (born 1929), Polish-born British weightlifter"]}, {"page": "List of Jews in sports", "response": ["* Ben Helfgott, Polish-born British, 3x British champion (lightweight), 3x Maccabiah champion; survived Buchenwald and Theresienstadt concentration camps, as all but one other of his family were killed by the Nazis"]}, {"page": "Helfgott", "response": ["*Ben Helfgott (born 1930), British Holocaust survivor, and champion weightlifter"]}, {"page": "List of sportspeople with dual nationality", "response": ["|Ben Helfgott"]}, {"page": "National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum", "response": ["|Ben Helfgott"]}, {"page": "1957 Maccabiah Games", "response": ["Ben Helfgott, a concentration camp survivor, won the weightlifting gold medal in the lightweight class for Great Britain for the third Games in a row."]}, {"page": "1950 Maccabiah Games", "response": ["Ben Helfgott, a concentration camp survivor, won the weightlifting gold medal in the lightweight class for Great Britain."]}, {"page": "1953 Maccabiah Games", "response": ["Ben Helfgott, a concentration camp survivor, won the weightlifting gold medal in the lightweight class for Great Britain for the second Games in a row."]}, {"page": "Pride of Britain Awards", "response": ["| Ben Helfgott"]}, {"page": "Herman Rosenblat", "response": ["Waltzer had been interviewing survivors for a new book, and he had been told that the story was probably false. In November 2008 Waltzer contacted forensic genealogists Sharon Sergeant and Colleen Fitzpatrick and started investigating the matter. He found out that the prisoners of that concentration camp were prohibited from approaching a camp's fence on pain of death, nor was anyone allowed to approach a fence from the outside. Such perimeter fences were electrified and watched 24/7 by armed guards stationed on guard towers, ready to shoot anyone who approached the fence from either side. The SS barracks were near to the only fence that faced outwards, and prisoners approaching the barracks would have been executed. Waltzer also discovered that Herman's future wife Roma was never in the town of Schlieben, but that she lived throughout that period in a German farm  away, near Breslau. Another survivor of the same camp, Ben Helfgott, told him that Rosenblat had never told the story before the mid-1990s.Caleb Daniloff, Untrue Stories, a genealogist reveals the painful truth about three Holocaust memoirs: they're fiction. Bostonia (Alumni Magazine of Boston University) Waltzer started questioning the publisher and the agent about the authenticity of the story, with little success.
