He was a pioneer in many fields though, often leading the way for others, but his lack of discipline meant he hardly ever saw a project through, being easily distracted by new ideas.  If it wasn't for this inability to see things to a conclusion, Low could well have been remembered as one of the great men of science.  Many of his scientific contemporaries disliked him, due in part to his using the title \"professor\", which he wasn't entitled to do as he didn't occupy an academic chair.  His love of the limelight and publicity probably also added to the dislike.\nArchibald M.

Baker Ltd during 1912\"The Low Forced Induction Engine\", The Motor Cycle, 24 Oct 1912, pp1192-1193 and the results displayed on their stand at the Olympia Motor Cycle show in November 1912. The engine was a high compression four-stroke motorcycle engine, with the gasoline fuel separately pressurised to 1000psi and admitted into the cylinder 'at the moment of highest compression' by a small rotary valve, with simultaneous ignition by a spark plug and trembler coil allowing sparking to continue throughout the combustion phase. The fuel being injected was described as being in vapour phase having been heated by the engine cylinder. The pressure of the fuel was regulated at the fuel pump, and the amount of fuel admitted was controlled by mechanical means at the rotary admission valve. It seems this radical design wasn't taken further by F.E. Baker."]}, {"page": "List of futurologists", "response": ["| Archibald Low || 1888 || 1956 || space "]}, {"page": "History of television", "response": ["In May 1914 Archibald Low gave the first demonstration of his television system at the Institute of Automobile Engineers in London. He called his system 'Televista'. The events were widely reported worldwide and were generally entitled Seeing By Wireless. The demonstrations had so impressed Harry Gordon Selfridge that he included Televista in his 1914 Scientific and Electrical Exhibition at his store.  It also interested Deputy Consul General Carl Raymond Loop who filled a US consular report from London containing considerable detail about Low's system. Low's invention employed a matrix detector (camera) and a mosaic screen (receiver/viewer) with an electro-mechanical scanning mechanism that moved a rotating roller over the cell contacts providing a multiplex signal to the camera/viewer data link. The receiver employed a similar roller. The two rollers were synchronised. Hence, it was unlike any of the intervening TV systems of the 20th Century and in many respects, Low had a digital TV system 80 years before the advent of today's digital TV. World War One began shortly after these demonstrations in London and Low became involved in sensitive military work, and so he did not apply for a patent until 1917. His \"Televista\" Patent No. 191,405 titled \"Improved Apparatus for the Electrical Transmission of Optical Images\" was finally published in 1923\u2014delayed possibly for security reasons. The patent states that the scanning roller had a row of conductive contacts corresponding to the cells in each row of the array and arranged to sample each cell in turn as the roller rotated. The receivers roller was similarly constructed and each revolution addressed a row of cells as the rollers traversed over their array of cells. Loops report tells us that... \"The roller is driven by a motor of 3,000 revolutions per minute, and the resulting variations of light are transmitted along an ordinary conducting wire.\""]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* 1917 onwards: Radio guidance systems pioneered by Archibald Low (1888\u20131956).", "* 1914: First operational fighter aircraft, the Vickers F.B.5 (a.k.a. th \"Gunbus\"), developed from a design by Archibald Low (1888\u20131956)."]}, {"page": "Professor Low", "response": ["#REDIRECTArchibald Low"]}, {"page": "A.M.
