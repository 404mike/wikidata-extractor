Many of his publications appeared as volumes of the Hakluyt Society. He played a major role in assisting the presentation of the historical aspects during the quadricentennial celebrations (1984\u20131987) of the first establishment a colony at Roanoke Island.\nQuinn was born in Dublin, Ireland and was the single pupil at his first school. He graduated from Queen's University, Belfast in 1931. He then completed a PhD on the early Tudor administration in Ireland at King's College London. He subsequently spent five years as lecturer at University College, Southampton (now Southampton University). Returning Belfast in 1939 he taught Irish history.\nHe became interested in the voyages of discovery made by Humphrey Gilbert. At that time historians relied uncritically on the works of Richard Hakluyt published around 1600. Quinn's work and the new sources he discovered resulted in his first volume for the Hakluyt Society, and marked the beginning of his seminal work on voyages of exploration, which he developed from 1944 at University College, Swansea. In 1957 he moved to Liverpool University.\nAt the instigation of America's Four Hundredth Anniversary Committee his Set Fair for Roanoke: Voyages and Colonies, 1584\u20131590 was published by University of North Carolina Press in 1985.\nHe died in Liverpool, England on 19 March 2002.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roanoke Colony", "response": ["David Beers Quinn concluded that the 1587 colonists sought to relocate to their original destination \u2013 Chesapeake Bay \u2013 using the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings.

Following White\u2019s failure to locate any of the colonists, the main body of the colonists would have quickly assimilated with the Chesepians, while the lookouts on Croatoan would have blended into the Croatan tribe."]}, {"page": "Richard Amerike", "response": ["Little is known of the first thirty years of Ap Meryk's life.

White is known to have arrived at Roanoke with the colonists, but there is no record of him remaining with the colony through the winter or returning to England with Richard Grenville's fleet. David Beers Quinn argued that White must have remained in the colony long enough to produce a map based on the colonists' 1586 exploration of the region.  He speculated that a simple error could have omitted White from the list, or included him as \"Iohn Twyt,\" \"William White,\" or \"Iohn Wright.\"   In contrast, James Horn observed that White produced no known artwork of the people and towns discovered after August 1585, suggesting he was no longer present in the colony.  As for the map, Horn argued that White, who was not a surveyor, would have based his illustration on someone else's survey data, making it no less plausible that he received such data in England than at Roanoke.  In any event, the dispute raises the possibility of errors in the list Hakluyt published, and that the figure of 108 may not be exact.", "In a 1955 analysis of the list, David Beers Quinn determined \"therefore, eighty-five men, less one dead (George Howe) and two returned (John White and Simon Fernandez), seventeen women and eleven children, making 113 brought from England and 110 left by White, plus two children born on Roanoke Island and two Indians, the total left behind being 114.\"  However, Quinn's count of 85 European men may be in error, as he presents all 91 names from Hakluyt but only deducts three.    A very conservative tabulation (discounting White, Fernandes, Howe, Thomas Smith and the second Thomas Harris, and assuming Manteo and Towaye did not reside with the colony) would yield a population of 112 following White's departure.  In contrast, Andy Gabriel-Powell proposed that the Hakluyt list may be incomplete, and that the total could be as high as 121.
