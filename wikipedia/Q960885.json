A more accurate film of the Wars of Scottish Independence was written and directed by David Mackenzie, this being Outlaw King, this being said it has faced its own criticises for inaccuracy, a notable example is how Robert the Bruce is portrayed as enigmatic and well-behaved man of the people who desires to restore Scotland to its inhabitants, however, historian Fiona Watson notes the real Robert I was most likely cold, canny, and driven by his personal ambition, and Edward II, Bruce's enemy, was depicted as a cruel and oppressive person who is eager to succeed his father despite any historical evidence of Edward II having displayed such traits, however Edward II was reluctant to assume the mantle of kingship and was known to be generous with his servants."]}, {"page": "David MacKenzie", "response": ["* David Mackenzie (director) (born 1966), Scottish director", "* David Mackenzie (trade unionist) (1922\u20131989), Scottish trade union leader"]}, {"page": "Mark Mancina", "response": ["| David Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "Max Richter", "response": ["| Perfect Sense || 2011 || David Mackenzie || "]}, {"page": "London Fields (novel)", "response": ["David Cronenberg was approached in 2001 to do a film adaptation of the book, and Amis wrote a draft of the script.
