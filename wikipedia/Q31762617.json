The vast importance of his private collection of books and manuscripts cannot be overestimated, since it affords scholars the opportunity to examine some twenty-four distinct liturgical rites used by the different Jewish communities of the nineteenth century: Aleppo, Ashkenazi, Egyptian, Italian, North African (Morocco), Tunis, Tlemcen, Karaite, Sefardi (Spanish), Bene Israel, Cochin, Turkish, Yemen, among others.David Solomon Sassoon originally owned some 412 manuscripts and twenty incunables, the rarest of which he retrieved from Baghdad. By 1914, the Sassoon collection numbered 500 manuscripts. Between 1914 and 1932, when the Catalogue was published, the manuscripts grew to 1,220, of which 1,153 are fully described in the Catalogue. When David and his mother visited the Holy Land in 1925, he acquired the Decisions of Rabbi Isaiah ben Mali di Trani the Elder (thirteenth century) on Hullin (MS No. 702, Cat. p. 697). One of the more important manuscripts obtained by him is Sefer Halakhot Pesu\u1e33ot of Rabbi Yehudai Gaon, a work that he obtained from a Jew in Yemen in 1911, but written in Babylon or Persia in the ninth or tenth century. Sassoon also obtained in Yemen a hand-written copy of Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, written in Spain in the fourteenth century (1397). Of the sixteen liturgical works (siddurim) that Sassoon obtained in Yemen, the earliest dates back to the early 16th-century (1531 CE). A study of these manuscripts reveal that the liturgy used by the Jews of Yemen underwent changes after Western influences penetrated into the Peninsula.Perhaps the most prized of Sassoon's acquisitions is the Farhi Bible, a codex which he purchased in Aleppo. It is said to have been written by Elisha Crescas in Provence between the years 1366 and 1383. It is now kept in a bank vault in Switzerland. Another treasure retrieved by Sassoon is the Damascus Pentateuch, a codex which he bought in Damascus in 1915, and which was acquired by the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem in 1975. A particularly significant acquisition in September 1923 was the Diwan of Samuel Hanagid (MS No. 589, Cat. pp. 451\u2013460), which the Oxford University Press published with an introduction by Sassoon in 1924. Samuel ha-Levi b. Joseph ibn Nagrela (993-1056) died ten years before the Norman Conquest of England.\nMany of the manuscripts and incunabula collected by David Sassoon were auctioned by Sotheby's of London in Zurich and in New York, between the years 1975 - 1994, in order to satisfy the Sassoon estate's British tax obligations. Today, most of what remains of David Solomon Sassoon's private collection of Hebrew manuscripts is stored at the University of Toronto, in Canada, although a small cluster of manuscripts from the estate of David Solomon Sassoon are now at the British Library, which were either offered to the library in lieu of tax, or were purchased at Sotheby's auction sales in the 1970s.His son, Solomon David Sassoon (1915\u20131985), was an educator, Rabbi, philanthropist and fundraiser, and also a collector of Jewish manuscripts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cochin Jews", "response": ["In 1768, a certain Tobias Boas of Amsterdam had posed eleven questions to Rabbi Yehezkel Rachbi of Cochin.

His acclaim and renown came on account of a commentary that he wrote on the Jerusalem Talmud, covering the Order known as Zeraim and the treatise She\u1e33alim.Berakhoth Talmud Yerushalmi (\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05ea\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d9), with commentary by Solomon Sirilio, ed. Meir Lehmann, Mayence 1875. His commentary was one of the first to be made on the Jerusalem Talmud, although it remained in manuscript form until 1875, when it was first printed in Mayence by Meir Lehmann. As late as 1950, only three Talmudic tractates with Sirilio's commentary had been published: Berakhot (Mainz, 1875); Terumot (Jerusalem, 1934); Shevi'it (Jerusalem, 1935), although handwritten copies were made from the original manuscript, as shown by David Solomon Sassoon.David Solomon Sassoon, Ohel Dawid - Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London, vol. 2, Oxford University Press:London 1932, p. 671."]}, {"page": "Damascus Pentateuch", "response": ["The Damascus Pentateuch came to renown owing largely to the works of the bibliophile, David Solomon Sassoon, who bought the codex in Damascus in the early 20th century. It is one of the oldest extant Bible codices, ranking along with the Aleppo Codex and Leningrad Codex. In many places, the Damascus Pentateuch follows the traditions of the masorete, Aaron ben Asher, in plene scriptum and defective scriptum, as well as in most large and small letters, being harmonious with the Masoretic variants prescribed by Ben-Asher up to 52% of the time.Israel Yeivin, The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A Study of its Vocalization and Accentuation), Jerusalem 1968, p. 361. Like the Masoretic tradition of Ben Asher, the copyist of the Damascus Pentateuch also writes \u05e4\u05e6\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d3\u05db\u05d0 in Deut. 23:2 with an aleph, and writes \u05ea\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 in Exo. 25:31 in defective scriptum, without a yod, as also the word \u05d4\u05d0\u05e4\u05d3 in Exo. 28:26 is written by him in defective scriptum, without a waw. Such practices are also common with Aaron Ben Asher.As shown by early witnesses who saw the Aleppo Codex and described its content, such as Menashe Sathon, whose notes on the Aleppo Codex were sent to Jerusalem and later reviewed by M.D. Cassuto, who relayed the same unto Rabbi Yaakov Sapir (19th century). Yishai ben Amram ha-Cohen Amadi (late 16th century) had also seen the Aleppo Codex. See: Joseph Offer, M.D. Cassuto's Notes on the Aleppo Codex, Sefunot: Studies and Sources on the History of the Jewish Communities in the East (pub. by the Ben-Zvi Institute), Jerusalem 1989, p. 309 [33].  It is written on parchment, in three columns to the page, in large oriental square script typical of writing scripts used in the 9th century. Like other codices of its era, it bears micrography known as the Masora Magna (large Masora), that is, the preservation of the minuti\u00e6 of the text-tradition written as a gloss on the top and bottom of each page, as well as the Masora Parva (small Masora) written in between the columns. According to Sassoon, the writer of the Masora (critical notes of the Masoretic annotations) was a follower of Ben Asher, yet the Bible text (orthography and vocalization) follows that of Ben Naphtali and his school.David Solomon Sassoon, Ohel Dawid \u2013 Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London, vol. 1, London: Oxford University Press 1932, pp. 22\u201323 As to the age of the Codex, Sassoon has posited that \u201cthe manuscript is probably older than the British Museum MS., No. Oriental 4445, which is supposed to have been written about 820\u2013850 CE., of Babylonian origin. The text is furnished with Tiberian vowel points, accents, and the Rafeh strokes, e.g. the horizontal line written above the non-accentuated letters of \u05d1\u05d2\"\u05d3 \u05db\u05e4\"\u05ea (Begadkefat), including the \u05d0 in some cases, as on p.\u00a054 in vol. 1 (on Genesis 32:28In the Hebrew Bible, it is Genesis 32:29), \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc. The smaller divisions for the weekly biblical lections, otherwise known as Sedarim, are marked throughout the codex by the writer of the Masora by a large samekh (\u05e1) in the margin with the number of the Seder below."]}, {"page": "Nathan ben Abraham I", "response": ["Among the manuscripts and incunabula collected by David Solomon Sassoon is a two-page Judeo-Arabic copy of the Introduction taken from Rabbi Nathan's commentary, believed to have been singled-out because of its more profound nature.Sassoon, D.S. (1932), pp. 1061\u20131062. Sassoon dated the copy to the 15th-century, but not knowing the full nature of the work, thought it to be an Introduction to the Talmud, and which he surmised was written by Joseph ben Judah ibn \u02bfA\u1e33nin. Rabbi Yosef Qafih has provided a Hebrew translation of the Introduction in the Mishnah published by El ha-Meqorot."]}, {"page": "Al-Ousta Codex", "response": ["The first volume of the book is adorned with an illuminated frontispiece and other decorative pages, showing a printed seven-branched candlestick and its appurtenances, using an old squeezing technique to produce a relief effect with gold tracings.Jacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 2), Magenza (Mainz) 1874, pp. 175a\u2013b In the words of Sapir, the codex measures \"two-thirds of a cubit in length, and one-half of a cubit in width.\" It is written upon smooth and thin parchment that was split in half, having the same texture on both its sides. The layout of the codex is made with three columns to a page, with thirty lines to each column. The beginning of the codex contains a genealogical record thought to belong to its original owner, Sar-Shalom the nasi, who traces his lineage back to King David and to the First Man, Adam.Jacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 2), Magenza (Mainz) 1874, pp. 175a\u2013b (in Hebrew); cf. ibid.

However, Sapir, in counting the number of generations that had passed since Sar-Shalom's ancestor, Bostanai, reasons that the time-frame given for this man who acquired the codex would have roughly been accurate."]}, {"page": "Ezekiel Judah", "response": ["The Ma\u2019tuk family of Baghdad were descended from Rabbi Ma\u2019tuk, the last Nasi or Prince of the Jewish community of Anah, on the Euphrates, who fled to Baghdad with his family in the first quarter of the 17th century following the threats of a tyrannical governor who had persecuted the community. Rabbi Ma\u2019tuk, as was the custom for leaders of leading Jewish communities in Iraq at the time, had been the Saraf-Bashi or Treasurer of the governor. The historian of Baghdad Jewry Rabbi David Solomon Sassoon says the Ma\u2019tuk family has been established in Anah for centuries.", "The family's arrival in Baghdad reflected a revival of that city's fortunes. Baghdad, having been extinguished as a Jewish centre following its capture by Timur in the 14th century was re-emerging as a major Jewish centre when the family arrived in the early 17th century. According to historian Zvi Yehuda, the 15th century sees no reports on Jews in Baghdad or in its surroundings, in Basra, Hilla, Kifil, Anah, Kurdistan, even in Persia and the Persian Gulf. The migration of the Ma\u2019tuk family to Baghdad was one part of the city's incipient Jewish revival. According to the historian and Rabbi David Solomon Sassoon the family were one of the oldest Jewish families of Baghdad. The 19th-century German ethnographer H. Peterman corroborated writing that the oldest Jewish families of Baghdad came from Anah, amongst them the Ma\u2019tuk.Historians of Iraqi Jewry recount that the Ma\u2019tuk or later Yehuda or Judah family achieved great renown as scholars, rabbis, merchants and communal leaders, in Baghdad in the 18th and 19th century including most prominently through the communal leader, poet and astronomer Sliman Ben David Ma\u2019tuk, also is also known to historians under the Anglicised name as Solomon Ma\u2019tuk."]}, {"page": "David Sassoon", "response": ["*David Solomon Sassoon (1880\u20131942), Iraqi bibliophile"]}]}}
