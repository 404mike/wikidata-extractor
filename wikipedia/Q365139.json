He won twelve Major titles during his career. A right-hander, he was known for his power and technical ability which put him ahead of competition at the time. Renshaw shared the all-time male record of seven Wimbledon singles titles with American Pete Sampras until 2017 when Roger Federer won his eighth singles title. His six consecutive singles titles (1881\u201386) is an all-time record. Additionally he won the doubles title five times together with his twin brother Ernest. William Renshaw was the first president of the British Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 12", "response": ["*1904 \u2013 William Renshaw, English tennis player (b. 1861)"]}, {"page": "January 3", "response": ["* 1861 \u2013 William Renshaw, English tennis player (d. 1904)"]}, {"page": "Tennis", "response": ["| William Renshaw||style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan = 8|7"]}, {"page": "1904", "response": ["** William Renshaw, British tennis player (born 1861)"]}, {"page": "Pete Sampras", "response": ["Sampras reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in early 2000, falling to the eventual champion Agassi in a five-set match. He won the Ericsson Open for the third time in March. After getting knocked out in the first round at the French Open, he won his seventh and final title  at Wimbledon, battling through tendinitis in his right shin and a painful back injury in the process equalling the then all time gentleman's singles title record of William Renshaw. In the final, Sampras was a set down and 4-1 down in the second set tie break against Patrick Rafter, but went on to win in four sets. This was his 13th Grand Slam singles title, breaking the all-time record of Roy Emerson that had stood for over 30 years.", "Sampras was known for his natural attacking serve-and-volley game, all-round game, and strong competitive instinct. Sampras's best surface was undoubtedly the fast-playing grass courts,based on total wins per surface. Sampras won seven Wimbledon Gentleman's Singles titles (1993\u201395, 1997\u20132000), broken only by a loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual winner Richard Krajicek. Sampras's seven Wimbledon Gentleman's Singles titles, tied with William Renshaw, has only been surpassed by Federer who won a record eighth Gentleman's Singles title in 2017.https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/roll_of_honour/gentlemenssingles.html  Sampras is lauded by many tennis analysts as one of the greatest male grass-court players of all time. Sampras also shares the record of five US Open titles in the Open Era with Jimmy Connors and Federer. He won back-to-back US Open titles in 1995 and 1996, despite vomiting on the court at 1\u20131 in the final set tiebreak due to dehydration in the 1996 quarterfinals against \u00c0lex Corretja. Combined with his two Australian Open titles, this gave Sampras a total of fourteen majors won on grass and hard courts."]}, {"page": "The Championships, Wimbledon", "response": ["|  William Renshaw", "|  William Renshaw"]}, {"page": "1881 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeated John Hartley (GB) 6\u20130 6\u20131 6\u20131"]}, {"page": "1882 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Ernest Renshaw (GB) 6\u20131 2\u20136 4\u20136 6\u20132 6\u20132"]}, {"page": "1883 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Ernest Renshaw (GB) 2\u20136 6\u20133 6\u20133 4\u20136 6\u20133"]}, {"page": "1884 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Herbert Lawford (GB) 6\u20130 6\u20134 9\u20137"]}, {"page": "1885 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Herbert Lawford (GB) 7\u20135 6\u20132 4\u20136 7\u20135"]}, {"page": "1886 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Herbert Lawford (GB) 6\u20130 5\u20137 6\u20133 6\u20134"]}, {"page": "1889 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 William Renshaw (GB) defeats Ernest Renshaw (GB) 6\u20134 6\u20131 3\u20136 6\u20130"]}, {"page": "1890 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 Willoughby Hamilton (GB) defeats William Renshaw (GB) 6\u20138 6\u20132 3\u20136 6\u20131 6\u20131"]}]}}
