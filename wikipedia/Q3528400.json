He scored his maiden first-class half century on his Test debut against Australia at Old Trafford in 1981. Forced home from the 1984\u201385 tour of India due to back trouble, this effectively curtailed his progression in the Test match arena, where he took 26 wickets at 41.69 each.Allott left his job as a commentator for Sky Sports to become director of cricket at Lancashire for the 2018 season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 14", "response": ["*1956 \u2013 Paul Allott, English cricketer and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "Altrincham", "response": ["Footballer Jack Liggins was born here in 1906.

Despite a resurgence in limited overs matches, Lancashire finished in the bottom six of the county championship. After suffering defeat in the final of the 1986 Nat West Trophy, David Hughes was appointed captain. Towards the end of the 1980s, Lancashire's side began to develop, with Graeme Fowler and Gehan Mendis building a productive opening partnership, while David Hughes and Neil Fairbrother provided support in the middle order. The bowlers were led by Patrick Patterson and Paul Allott with support from David Hughes, Mike Watkinson and Jack Simmons. In 1987 after eleven successive years in the bottom six, Lancashire finished second in the championship, their highest position in 27\u00a0years. Mike Atherton made his Lancashire debut in 1987\u00a0\u2013 scoring 600\u00a0runs in the second half of the season\u00a0\u2013 and Wasim Akram first played for the team in 1988. Lancashire defeated Worcestershire in the final of the Refuge Cup in 1988. The following year the club won the Sunday League on the last day of the season in 1989 and finished fourth in the championship. At the age of 48, in 1989 Jack Simmons retired after having taken 985\u00a0first-class wickets for the county.", "In 1990, Lancashire won both the Nat West Trophy and Benson & Hedges Cup finals at Lord's. This was the first time any county had won both competitions in the same year; Lancashire narrowly missed out on a treble, finishing runners-up in the Sunday League. Lancashire's consistency continued, and the team finished second in the Sunday League and B&H Cup. Paul Allott and Graeme Fowler were released at the end of the 1992 season. The team lost the B&H final to Derbyshire in 1993. In 1994, young bowlers Peter Martin and Glen Chapple took 50\u00a0wickets each. The batting too looked promising, with John Crawley scoring two double centuries and Jason Gallian steadily improving. In 1995, Lancashire again won the Benson & Hedges Cup. In 1996, Lancashire again won the double of the NatWest Trophy and Benson & Hedges Cup. In 1998, with Wasim Akram as captain, Lancashire won the NatWest Trophy and Axa League, and finished second in the championship despite losing only five games in all competitions throughout the season.
