Duffy is particularly noted for his work on the future of the office and the flexible use of space.He was president of the RIBA from 1993 to 1995. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours 1997. In 2004, he received the British Council of Offices (BCO) President's Award for Lifetime Achievement and in 2008 was named by Facilities Magazine as one of 25 Pioneers of Facilities Management in the UK. He is currently on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.\nIn the 1960s, Duffy was responsible for introducing B\u00fcrolandschaft (office landscaping) into the English-speaking world. His doctoral research at Princeton was focused on the mapping the relationship between organisational structure and office layouts. In the 1970s, he was one of the pioneers who introduced North American practice in Space Planning and Facility management into Europe. He coined the concept of  \"Shell, Services, Scenery and Sets\"(or Shearing layers), the analysis of buildings and building components in terms of layers of longevity to facilitate the accommodation of technological and organisational change. This concept was later elaborated by Stewart Brand in his book How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built (Brand, 1994). In the 1980s Duffy and his DEGW colleagues initiated the ORBIT (Office Research: Buildings and Information Technology) into the impact on office design of advances in Information Technology. This research had a substantial impact initially on key British office projects such as Broadgate and Stockley Park and then on office design worldwide. More recently Duffy's interests have focused on the challenges that increasing reliance on virtual communications is bringing into urban design \u2013 asking the question, \"In an increasingly virtual world what arguments can architects and urbanists use to justify spaces and places?\"\nNational Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/103) with Francis Duffy in 2013 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.Frank Duffy was editor of the Architectural Association Journal (1965\u201367) and of Facilities (1982\u201390).\nAs a consultant specialising in Workplace Strategy for almost 40 years, Duffy has worked internationally for a wide variety of corporate and government clients. DEGW now has offices in the UK, the US, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Singapore and Australia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 3", "response": ["*1940 \u2013 Frank Duffy, English architect"]}, {"page": "1940 in architecture", "response": ["* September 3 \u2013 Frank Duffy, British architect"]}, {"page": "Architectural Association School of Architecture", "response": ["*Frank Duffy"]}, {"page": "1992 Windsor Castle fire", "response": ["Designs were submitted to a Restoration Committee, whose chairman was the Duke of Edinburgh and deputy chairman was the Prince of Wales.

Recommendations often include moving from cellular (predominantly private office) environments to open plan, or introducing new ways of working and moving to a flexible working environment, as first proposed by Frank Duffy in the nineties. At around the same time, Erik Veldhoen, a Dutch based consultant and workplace strategist 'avant la lettre', developed the so-called 'activity based design approach'. It was the first integrated design approach ever developed, combining insights from different disciplines including design, ICT, social organization and management. With this methodology he was able to realize the first 'activity-based' work environment for Interpolis, an insurance company, based in Tilburg (The Netherlands). An 'Activity Based' Work Environment is where the occupants have access to a range of work settings, including working at home or on the move, but also share workstations, often referred to as hot desking or the related Hoteling. Since 2001, the concept of coworking space has also provided options for the startups, freelancers and companies who prefer this plug-and-play solution with shorter lease terms commitment.

Duffy considers that the study did much to reform architectural practices in Britain, particularly by contributing to the development of the RIBA Plan of Work, a set of discrete stages of the architect's work from inception to completion. As well as each stage being precisely described, the stages also had a precise fraction of the total architect's fee associated with them. However, as Duffy also comments, the identification of the usual work pattern as 'normal services' also implied that many activities known as 'other services' (management, surveying, engineering) lay outside the work of the architect, and architects lost market share as a consequence of such exclusivity (page 179)."]}]}}
