In 2013, Lexington Books published The Life of Margaret Alice Murray: A Woman's Work in Archaeology, a biography of Murray authored by Kathleen L. Sheppard, then an assistant professor at Missouri University of Science and Technology; the book was based upon Sheppard's doctoral dissertation produced at the University of Oklahoma. Although characterising it as being \"written in a clear and engaging manner\", one reviewer noted that Sheppard's book focuses on Murray the \"scientist\" and as such neglects to discuss Murray's involvement in magical practices and her relationship with Wicca."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London", "response": ["*Margaret Stefana Drower (1911\u20132012)"]}, {"page": "The Cambridge Ancient History", "response": ["|Margaret Stefana Drower & Jean Bott\u00e9ro"]}, {"page": "Peggy Drower", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margaret Stefana Drower"]}, {"page": "Margaret Drower", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margaret Stefana Drower"]}, {"page": "List of female Egyptologists", "response": ["| Margaret Stefana Drower"]}, {"page": "Margaret S.
