In 1845 The Art-Union noted that \"save to those who have resided in Rome, it is not generally known that there exists in that city any British Academy of Art\", and in 1864 Stephen Watson Fullom wroteIt is a poor substitute for the French Academy, and falls very short of its effect. That institution has been a home to most of the French artists, who there were fellow-pupils, and moulded into a brotherhood. But the English meet only occasionally, and part as strangers or rivals. Political troubles in Italy,  began to limit the number of British artists interested in staying in Rome for any length of time, and Severn himself drifted away from the Academy, having become involved in diplomatic activities, eventually becoming British Consul."]}]}}
