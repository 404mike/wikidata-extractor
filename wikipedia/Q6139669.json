While working for Scott he recorded his first Royal Ascot win in 1851 and trained his first Classic winner when Catherine Hayes won The Oaks in 1853. When Scott sold his horses to James Merry in 1857, Dawson continued to train them but moved his base to Russley Park, near Lambourn. For Merry, Dawson trained Sunbeam to win St Leger in 1858 and Thormanby to win the 1860 Derby."]}, {"page": "Thormanby (horse)", "response": ["Thormanby was a lean, wiry, rather plain-looking chestnut horse with a white stripe and a white sock on his left hind leg. He was bred by Benjamin Plummer who had difficulty finding a buyer for the young horse as a yearling at the Doncaster sales before selling him privately for \u00a3350 to the trainer Mathew Dawson. Dawson bought the colt for his principal patron James Merry, who was initially reluctant to complete the transaction. Dawson had to keep and feed the horse at his own expense for several months before Merry agreed to hand over the money. Dawson trained the colt at Russley Park, near Lambourn.", "At Epsom on 23 May, Thormanby impressed observers when he appeared in the paddock before the Derby: his coat was \"like a mirror\" and as he galloped to the start, he \"hardly seemed to touch the ground.\" He started the 4/1 second favourite in a field of thirty runners, with The Wizard being made 3/1 favourite and the American-bred colt Umpire, whose supporters included the famous boxer John C. Heenan, being also strongly fancied. The attendance for the race was estimated at up to 480,000. Ridden by Harry Custance, a lightweight jockey who had to carry twenty-two pounds of lead in his saddle to make the required weight, Thormanby raced just behind the leaders in the early stages before making his challenge on the outside early in the straight. A furlong from the finish Thormanby overtook The Wizard and went into the lead, from which point on the result was not in doubt. Thormanby won easily by one and a half lengths from The Wizard, with the outsider Horror taking third. James Merry reportedly took more than \u00a385,000 in winning bets."]}, {"page": "The Merry Monarch", "response": ["On his only race as a four-year-old, The Merry Monarch returned to Epsom for the Grand Stand Plate, a mile and a quarter handicap on the day after the Derby.

According to one version of events, William and John Sr. came to an arrangement whereby Lord of the Isles would be allowed to win the 2000 Guineas, but would not be trained seriously for the Derby, while the reverse would apply to St Hubert. Lord of the Isles duly gave Day his first classic winner in the Guineas, but when Henry Padwick discovered the arrangement, he sacked John Barham Day, effectively ending his training career. When St Hubert was withdrawn from the Derby, the Day family were forced to rely on Kingstown and Lord of the Isles, despite the fact that the latter had hardly been trained since the Guineas. Both William and John Jr. were strongly suspected of involvement in a series of plots to \"nobble\" the other leading fancy Wild Dayrell, who nevertheless won the race, with Kingstown second and Lord of the Isles third. Merry removed all his horses from Day's stable, but the Jockey Club on this occasion took no action. In his memoirs, Day denied any wrongdoing, insisting that Lord of the Isles had never been regarded as a Derby horse and only ran at the insistence of the owner. He explained the horse's lack of condition to his contracting a respiratory condition shortly before the race."]}, {"page": "1877 in Scotland", "response": ["* 3 February \u2013 James Merry, ironmaster, race-horse breeder and Liberal MP (1859\u201374) (born 1805)"]}, {"page": "1805 in Scotland", "response": ["* James Merry, ironmaster, Liberal politician and racehorse breeder (died 1877)"]}, {"page": "Surefoot", "response": ["Surefoot was a \"big, perfectly-formed\" bay horse bred in England by his owner Mr A.
