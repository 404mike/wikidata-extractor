Established by the bequest of artist Thomas Stuart Smith (1815\u20131869) on land supplied by the Burgh of Stirling, it is an historic public-private partnership which has continued to the present day. It was founded as a gallery of mainly contemporary art, with museum and library reading room \u2018for the benefit of the inhabitants of Stirling, Dunblane and Kinbuck\u2019.", "The Stirling Smith has had a chequered history of 130 years which is worth examining in detail. The founder, Thomas Stuart Smith was an artist who wanted the art gallery element of his Institute to predominate.", "The Smith Institute first opened to the public on 11 August 1874. It was an occasion for great celebration in Stirling, and the shops in the town closed at noon to allow people to attend the opening. Nevertheless, there were some mixed feelings, for Thomas Stuart Smith, had died in 1869 and the location of the building was felt by many people to be too far away from the old town.", "At the opening ceremony, Provost Christie refuted criticism of the location by pointing out that \u2018five or ten minutes walk would bring any one to the Institute from the most distant part of the Burgh\u2019 and that the site was chosen on environmental grounds \u2018free from the noise and bustle and free from the dirt, dust and smoke, so that the students of art, science and literature could pursue their studies there unmolested and free from annoyance\u2019.  It was perhaps thanks to Provost Christie that the organisation came into being at all, for Thomas Stuart Smith\u2019s first thoughts were to leave his money to the Artists\u2019 Benevolent Association.", "== Thomas Stuart Smith (1815-1869) ==", "Thomas Stuart Smith's uncle supplied funding so that he could travel and paint in Italy starting in 1840. By the end of that decade he was having his work accepted by both the Salon des Beaux Arts in Paris and the Royal Academy in London.", "If the building was geographically disadvantaged, the lack of a living patron added to the problem.   Thomas Stuart Smith had intended to supervise the construction personally.  Many corners were cut in the construction, and it is evident from the idiosyncratic structure of the roof that the architect, John Lessels (1808\u20131883) of Edinburgh, had little direct input.", "The frontage to Dumbarton Road has a tetra style (four pillared) Doric portico.  The tympanum carries two relief carvings of the Stirling seal, the wolf on the left side and the Castle on the right.  In the centre is a coat of arms purporting to be that of Thomas Stuart Smith, but the heraldic arrangement is unknown and has never been entered at the Court of the Lord Lyon.  The inscription on the entablature below reads The Smith Institute, erected and endowed with funds bequeathed by Thomas Stuart Smith of Glassingall Perthshire.  There are six steps to the front door.  The wrought metal handrail by Phil Johnston of Ratho Byres Forge was added in 2000.  At either side of the steps are two plinths for sculpture (at present with urns) and there is an empty sculpture niche on the right side of the building.", "There were five public areas to the Smith in 1874.  On the left of the entrance was the Reading Room and Library.  This was a substantial room measuring 50 by , with an elaborate plasterwork scheme on the ceiling.  The ceiling had three sections, each with 15 panels containing casts of the Stirling Heads, alternated with casts of the Arms of Stirling, the monogram of Thomas Stuart Smith and the date of the building.  The woodwork was stained to look like oak, whilst the groundwork of each panel was in turquoise blue, the whole being enclosed in bands of soft red.  The Library walls were in \u2018drab Etruscan\u2019 to harmonise with the ceiling.", "During the years of the Great Depression, the money left by Thomas Stuart Smith failed to return much by way of interest.  The building began to develop problems, made worse by the Second World War.  By the 1960s, the underfunding and lack of development was serious, and the enduring memory that many Stirling citizens have of the building in this period is the sound of rain being caught in numerous metal buckets and tin cans, spread around the floor at strategic points."]}, {"page": "James Orrock", "response": ["He was educated in medicine, surgery, and dentistry at Edinburgh University, after which he practised as a dentist in Nottingham.
