He was punished by being banished from the university until he recanted, the offending pages being burnt. The proceedings were printed in a volume of Miscellanies, published by Edmund Curll in 1714. Wood was attacked by Bishop Burnet in A letter to the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry (1693), and defended by his nephew Dr Thomas Wood, in a Vindication of the Historiographer, to which is added the Historiographer's Answer (1693), reproduced in the subsequent editions of the Athenae. The nephew also defended his uncle in An Appendix to the Life of Bishop Seth Ward, 1697. After a short illness Anthony Wood died, and was buried in the outer chapel of St John Baptist (Merton College), in Oxford, where he had superintended the digging of his own grave only a few days before."]}, {"page": "Thomas Wood", "response": ["Thomas Wood may refer to:", "* Thomas Wood (1708\u20131799), British MP for Middlesex", "* Thomas Wood (1777\u20131860), British MP for Breconshire", "* Thomas Wood (British Army officer) (1804\u20131872), British MP for Middlesex", "* Thomas Wood (1815\u201398) (1815\u20131898), Canadian politician", "* Thomas Wood (mayor) (1792\u20131861), mayor of Columbus, Ohio", "* Thomas Wood (soldier) (1853\u20131933), British soldier and Conservative MP for Breconshire 1892\u20131900", "* Thomas Wood (bishop of Lichfield and Coventry) (1607\u20131692), Anglican diocesan bishop", "* Thomas Wood (bishop of Bedford) (1885\u20131961), Anglican suffragan bishop", "* Thomas Wood (priest), Roman Catholic chaplain to Queen Mary of England", "* Thomas Wood (reverend) (1711\u20131778), minister in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada", "* Thomas Wood (Somerset cricketer) (1861\u20131933), English cricketer", "* Thomas Wood (composer) (1892\u20131950), English composer and author", "* E.
