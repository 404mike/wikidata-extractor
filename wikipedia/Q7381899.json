She made a trip to London and was inspired by the work of local drag queen musicians, including Russella, at the Soho nightclub Madame Jojo's. The queens then became 'the Queens' in her stage name as a tribute. As soon as she returned to France, she left the ENSL grande \u00e9cole in the middle of the second year to devote herself fully to the musical project now called \"Christine and the Queens\". She dedicated many of her creations to them, and to all transgender individuals, describing her genre as \"freakpop\"."]}]}}
