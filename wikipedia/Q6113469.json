He missed only one match of what remained of Birmingham's 1909\u201310 season, initially playing at centre forward and then switched to inside right, and scored 10 goals, which was enough to make him the club's top scorer. They finished bottom of the table, and had to apply for re-election to the League. With the arrival of forwards including Jack Kidd, Thomas Jones and the prolific Jack Hall, Freeman played little in 1910\u201311."]}, {"page": "1904\u201305 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|IR ||||Jack Kidd"]}, {"page": "Jack Kidd", "response": ["Jack Kidd may refer to:", "* Jack Kidd (Scottish footballer) (1884\u2013?), Scottish football inside forward", "* Jack Kidd (Australian footballer) (1908\u20131960), Australian rules footballer", "* Jack Kidd (New Zealand footballer), former association football player who represented New Zealand"]}]}}
