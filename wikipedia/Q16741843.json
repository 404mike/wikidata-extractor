He was the great-nephew of another William Richardson, who was Member of Parliament for County Armagh at the time of the Williamite War in Ireland.\nHe was elected High Sheriff of Armagh for 1777 and sat in the Irish House of Commons for County Armagh, between 1783 and 1797. In 1807 he was elected to sit for County Armagh in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, serving until 1820.In 1775 Richardson married Dorothea (\"Dolly\") Monroe (b. 1754), a daughter of Henry Monroe of Roes Hall, Tullylish. She was a noted beauty who while staying in Dublin with her aunt Frances,  Lady Loftus, had been courted by Henry Grattan, Sir Hercules Langrishe, Francis Andrews, Provost of Trinity College, and the recently widowed Viceroy Lord Townshend. She had also been painted by Angelica Kauffman and alluded to in a poem by Oliver Goldsmith. Richardson and Dorothea had no children. She died in 1793, aged thirty-nine.\nThe following year Richardson married Louisa Magenis, daughter of Richard Magenis of Waringstown.  They had three daughters, Elizabeth, Isabella and Louisa, who jointly inherited Richhill on their father's death. Only the youngest daughter married (to Edward Bacon, sometime High Sheriff of Armagh), and when she died without heirs in 1881 the estate passed to the Richardsons of Rossfad, near Ballinamallard in County Fermanagh.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"3\" | William Richardson"]}, {"page": "William Richardson", "response": ["*William Richardson (1656\u20131727), MP for Armagh and Hillsborough", "*William Richardson (died 1755) (1690\u20131755), MP for Augher", "*William Richardson (1710\u20131758), MP for Armagh", "*William Richardson (1749\u20131822), MP for Armagh", "*Sir William Richardson, 1st Baronet (died 1830), MP for Augher and Ballyshannon", "*Friend Richardson (William Richardson, 1865\u20131943), 25th governor of California", "*William Richardson (Maryland politician) (1735\u20131825), Revolutionary War soldier", "*William Richardson (Mississippi politician) (1951-1997), Mississippi politician and teacher", "*William Richardson (governor) (died 1829), Deputy Governor of Anguilla", "*William Richardson (Cambridge University cricketer) (1861\u20131933), English cricketer with Cambridge University", "*William Richardson (Worcestershire cricketer) (1894\u20131971), English cricketer with Worcestershire", "*William Richardson (Derbyshire cricketer) (born 1938), English cricketer with Derbyshire", "*William Richardson (New South Wales cricketer) (1866\u20131930), Australian cricketer with New South Wales", "*William Richardson (footballer) (1880\u20131903), Australian rules footballer", "*William Richardson (martyr) (1572\u20131603),  beatified Roman Catholic martyr", "*William Richardson (bishop) (1844\u20131915), Anglican Bishop of Zanzibar, 1895\u20131901", "*William Richardson (antiquary) (1698\u20131775), English academic and antiquary", "*William Richardson (classicist) (1743\u20131814), Scottish professor and scholar", "*William Richardson (astronomer) (1796\u20131872), British astronomer", "*William Richardson (songwriter), Tyneside songwriter"]}, {"page": "1749 in Ireland", "response": ["*William Richardson, landowner and politician (died 1822)"]}, {"page": "Armagh County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)", "response": ["| William Richardson", "| William Richardson", "| rowspan=\"2\" | William Richardson", "| rowspan=\"2\" | William Richardson"]}, {"page": "High Sheriff of Armagh", "response": ["*1690: William Richardson of Legacorry", "*1737: William Richardson of Richhill Castle", "*1777: William Richardson of Richhill Castle"]}, {"page": "William Richardson (1710\u20131758)", "response": ["William Richardson (1710 \u2013 1758) was an Irish landowner from Richhill, County Armagh.", "Beckett,  Second Serjeant,   and father of William Richardson, High Sheriff in 1773 and MP for Armagh 1783-1797."]}, {"page": "William Richardson (1749-1822)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Richardson (1749\u20131822)"]}, {"page": "Armagh disturbances", "response": ["Dr. William Richardson stated, in what Jonathan Bardon describes as a \"detailed analysis\" of the situation, in 1797:"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1807 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Richardson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1812 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Richardson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1818 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Richardson"]}, {"page": "Richard Magenis (died 1807)", "response": ["*Louisa, married William Richardson, M.P. for Armagh"]}]}}
