His victory over John Jackson Walsh was part of a broad national win for the Republicans, including a sweep of statewide offices in Massachusetts, which was spurred by nativist opposition to Wilson administration policies on immigration.Litt, p. 26-27  Cox contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment in Massachusetts by characterizing discontented immigrants as a \"motley array of questionable groups and influences\".Litt, p. 31  He won reelection in 1922, in another race against disorganized Democratic opposition.  Although the state was in an economic downturn (an early whisper of the Great Depression), with textile production dropping and wages down, his campaigns emphasized \"economy and sound administration\" in governance, terms which characterized Republican campaigns through the 1920s.Huthmacher, p. 49  In 1922, Cox defeated former Mayor of Boston John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald by more than 60,000 votes.Huthmacher, p. 58"]}, {"page": "Matthew W. Bullock", "response": ["The January 1920 US Census had the couple married renting a home on Sarsfield Street and he was employed as a lawyer. Bullock was also credited with founding a branch of the YMCA to serve the South End-Roxbury black community which ran 1920-1922, and then was closed to preserve a non-segregated program with the main branch. In March Bullock was recognized in the Harvard Alumni Bulletin as the Secretary of the Boston Urban League, noted his service in France during WWI but thought that he had indeed received the Croix de Guerre from the French government, Son Matthew Jr. was born April 4, 1920, and a couple weeks later Bullock gave a talk on the history of the Urban League to a Boston Club, and spoke at St. Bartholomew's Church in late May. He filed to run for office in state government in July, was on the ballot with Andrew Lattimore, and had spent alittle over $17 on the registering for the election. He was also on the list of those available for the position of assistant director for the Department of Corporations and Taxation with the state. In October he addressed the Ellot Club as a member of the Boston Urban League on \u201cWhat does the Negro Want? The Answer\"*  while running for office. Bullock and Lattimore campaigned across Ward 13. Meanwhile his wife was visible at a fundraiser for Atlanta University. In November Bullock got more votes than Lattimer for the Republicans but both lost against the Democratic ticket. The two claimed they had been voted against for being black and the case had thought to be in contest because of increased Republican women registering to vote. Then governor John Jackson Walsh spoke out against the race issue prejudice in voting. Bullock and Lattimer advanced a recall petition against the Democrats in January 1921. In February Bullock returned to Everett to talk for the Board of Trade about \u201cThe Negro, a great asset\u201d and the article covering his talk recalled his 1896-1900 service at the Everett High School, then on to athletic success and now lawyer. A few days later Bullock and Lattimer testified about their challenge to the election and offered biographical summaries of their lives. Bullock detailed that he graduated from Everett High School, Dartmouth College, Harvard Law School and had a post-graduate class at Cornell. He tried to serve during WWI but was rejected \"because of an 'athlete's heart'\" as he put it but worked at a YMCA secretary overseas. Their petition had a hearing for the House Committee on Elections claiming illegal means had been used to complete the election. Depositions were taken of witnesses after a significant delay. The majority of the committee did not support the petition though at least one member did. Bullock and Lattimer escalated with the state Speaker of the House seeking a chance to address the whole House. The progress of the petition had cost $225 in legal fees, (near three thousand dollars in 2021 dollars.)"]}, {"page": "1922 United States Senate election in Massachusetts", "response": ["* John Jackson Walsh, former State Senator and 1920 gubernatorial nominee"]}, {"page": "1920 United States gubernatorial elections", "response": ["| Massachusetts ||bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"| Calvin Coolidge || Republican || Retired to run for U.S. Vice President, Republican victory || Channing H.
