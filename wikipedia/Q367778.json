He is best known for his groundbreaking work with the rock band U2, and is recognised as one of the leading artists in this field.He was born in 1959 in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and raised in Sheffield, England, son of Robert Woodman Williams, a singer & medical practitioner who was an early pioneer in the then fledgling field of physiotherapy and who also sang with South Yorkshire Opera.  Williams excelled at mathematics and science in school and planned to study physics at University College, London.  The advent of punk rock caused him to enter the music scene instead, and he began doing lights for various bands such as Writz, Deaf School and Stiff Little Fingers.Willie Williams has been responsible for the design of U2's tours from 1982 onward, most famously the extravagant, bewildering Zoo TV Tour (1992\u201393), and most recently the Innocence + Experience Tour (2015), the Joshua Tree Tours 2017 and 2019, and the Experience + Innocence Tour (2018). He has also worked with musical artists such as R.E.M., David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, Robbie Williams, Darren Hayes and George Michael.Williams has designed for the Montreal-based dance company La La La Human Steps.  Other collaborations have been with Laurie Anderson, Marianne Faithfull and the Kronos Quartet, most notably on Sun Rings, a joint effort with NASA that combines the string quartet's music with video and audio material collected by the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Taylor", "response": ["While still running Squint, Taylor had begun a film project called St. Gimp, co-written with Ben Pearson and Willie Williams.

Williams had recently worked on David Bowie's Sound+Vision Tour, which used film projection and video content, and he was keen to \"take rock show video to a level as yet undreamed of\".McGee (2008), p. 135 The band played Williams some of their new music\u2014inspired by alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music\u2014and they told him about the \"Zoo TV\" phrase that Bono liked. Williams also learned about the band's affection for the Trabant, an East German automobile that derisively became a symbol for the fall of Communism; he thought their fondness for the car was \"deeply, deeply bizarre\". In May, he brainstormed the idea to construct a lighting system of recycled Trabants. Williams, who \"always favored a very homemade approach to lighting, over an off-the-shelf one\", had previously fashioned fixtures from objects such as trash cans and furniture. He saw the Trabant as the perfect object to light U2's tour, envisioning it as a \"suitably surreal and symbolic scenic element\". On 1 June 1991, Williams visited the engineering department of Light & Sound Design (LSD) in Birmingham, England, to ask for help with building a prototype.", "The Zoo TV stages were designed by Willie Williams, U2's stage designer since the War Tour of 1982\u20131983. In place of U2's austere and minimalist productions of the 1980s, the Zoo TV stage was a complex setup, designed to instill \"sensory overload\" in its audience. The set's giant video screens showed footage of the band members performing, pre-recorded video, live television transmissions, and flashing text phrases. Electronic, tabloid-style headlines ran on scrawls at the ends of the stage. The band's embracing of such technology was meant as a radical departure in form, and as a commentary on the pervasive nature of technology. This led many critics to describe the show as ironic.", "The stadium legs of the tour received more consistent praise than the arena shows. Critics noted that while the show and its setlist were largely the same as before, the tour mostly benefited from the increased scale. The New York Daily News said that the stage \"looked like a city made of television sets\u2014an electronic Oz\" and that \"glitz was used not as a mere distraction (as it has been by so many video-age artists), but as a determined conceit\". Gundersen also made the comparison to Oz, saying that even though the band was dwarfed by the setting, their adventurous musicianship still shone through. She concluded that the group had \"deliver[ed] a brilliant high-wire act\" between mocking and exploiting rock music clich\u00e9s, a comparison also made by stage designer Willie Williams. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said of the outdoor American leg, \"Zoo TV is the yardstick by which all other stadium shows will be measured.\" David Fricke of Rolling Stone said that the band had \"regained critical and commercial favor by negotiating an inspired balance between rock's cheap thrills and its own sense of moral burden\". He praised the band for \"retool[ing] themselves as wiseacres with heart and elephant bucks to burn\". Fricke noted that the increased visual effects for the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg increased the shows' \"mind-fuck\" factor. Many critics described the tour as \"post-modern\".Friedlander (2006), p. 276 The writers of Rolling Stone, in a best-of-1992 issue, named U2 co-winners of \"Best Band\", while awarding the Zoo TV Tour honours for both \"Best Tour\" and \"Worst Tour\".McGee (2008), p. 159", "At the 1992 Billboard Music Awards, U2 won for the No. 1 Boxscore Tour.

The band started to work on their ninth studio album, which was set to be finished by mid-1996 and released later that year prior to the Christmas and holiday season. Around the same time, in late 1995, Williams began developing concepts for the band's next tour. Among the proposed themes for the tour was a concept based on the end of the millennium titled \"U2000\", and a discoth\u00e8que concept involving a large mobile disco. Lead vocalist Bono became interested in one of Williams' designs that resembled a supermarket, which was inspired by facades of American post-war suburban outlet stores. Bono who believed that the symbol of a supermarket, with its large number of choices and temptations, could be used as a metaphor for U2's songs, which often deal with the struggle between desire and faith.

The heart shape was inspired by the video graphics being produced for the tour, and it was chosen by the creative team early in the design process. At the suggestion of bassist Adam Clayton, the stage was given an open center that could be filled with fans; the first 300 general admission ticketholders to queue before a concert were given wristbands and allowed access to the center of the heart. Williams was amused that the catwalks were the same shape as the vertical golden arch from the PopMart Tour stage when laid horizontally. The Elevation Tour stage was placed at one end of the venues, with seating offered \"in the round\". Due to this configuration, the stage designers focused on ensuring sightlines were not obstructed for anyone.

During the pre-show music, the AR experience saw \"the stage recast as an enormous iceberg\" that began to melt and flood the audience; the imagery was a precursor to the tsunami wave that displayed on the video screens during the final song of the show's first act, \"Until the End of the World\". For the opening song, \"Love Is All We Have Left\", the app displayed an avatar of Bono hovering above the audience, accompanying the real-life Bono as he performed the song. Williams justified the use of the phone in this way by saying, \"If you're going to look at your phone we're going to give you something to look at that's part of the narrative rather than you just making a movie that nobody is ever going to watch.\""]}, {"page": "Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show", "response": ["The names of the 9/11 victims were projected by twelve 7-kilowatt xenon PIGI film projectors manufactured by E/T/C Audiovisuel and supplied by Fourth Phase Image Systems Group; they were the same type of projectors used during the band's Elevation Tour. The victims' names were projected across the interior of the Superdome, as well as onto a Kabuki scrim measuring  high by  wide. Willie Williams and Catherine Owens created the projections, while Brian Beasley operated the projectors."]}, {"page": "Hype (board game)", "response": ["The game was conceived in 1980 by Steve Fairnie, lead singer for the British post-punk bands Writz and The Technos. Fairnie recruited Willie Williams, at the time the editor of Punty fanzine but soon to become the set designer and lighting director for U2. Together, Fairnie and Williams designed the game, and pitched the idea to new games publisher Virgin Games. The result was Hype, a game featuring a circular board and high quality components that was released in 1984. In addition to the lavish game pieces, the game also included a 12\" vinyl record by The Technos. "]}]}}
