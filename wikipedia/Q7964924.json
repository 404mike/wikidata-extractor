His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and John Watson Gordon. Significant Glasgow artists included John Graham-Gilbert and Daniel Macnee. David Wilkie emerged as of one of the most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. Alexander Nasmyth helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the mid-nineteenth century on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including Horatio McCulloch, Joseph Farquharson and William McTaggart. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as Pittenweem and Kirkudbright. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of genre painting, which was pursued by artists including John Burnet, Alexander George Fraser and Walter Geikie. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by William Allan, David Roberts and John Phillip.", "David Wilkie became the key figure in the development of British genre art. After a tour of Europe Wilkie he was increasingly influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting. He became most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life.MacDonald, Scottish Art, pp.\u00a084\u20137. His work on themes of Scottish everyday life included Village Politicians (1806), The Blind Fiddler (1806), Distraining for Rent (1815) and The Penny Wedding (1818). His most famous work was The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch, one of the most popular exhibitions in London in 1822. His sketch Knox preaching before the Lords of the Congregation (1822), dealt with the historic themes that would become a major part of Scottish painting in the second half of the century and he would also be a major influence on oriental painting. Scottish painters influenced by Wilkie included John Burnet (1784\u20131868), Alexander George Fraser (1785\u20131865) and Walter Geikie (1795\u20131837). A younger generation that took genre painting into the late nineteenth century included Erskine Nicol (1825\u20131904) and the brothers John (1818\u20131902) and Thomas Faed (1826\u20131900). Major themes included the Reformation, particularly scenes involving John Knox and Mary Queen of Scots, the Covenanters, especially the \"Killing Time\" of the 1680s, and the Jacobites.MacDonald, Scottish Art, pp.\u00a096\u20137."]}, {"page": "List of graphic artists in the Web Gallery of Art", "response": ["*Walter Geikie (1795\u20131837), 1 etching : Drunken Man, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh (url)"]}, {"page": "1837 in Scotland", "response": ["* 1 August \u2013 Walter Geikie, painter (born 1795)"]}, {"page": "Scottish genre art", "response": ["Scottish painters influenced by Wilkie included John Burnet, Alexander George Fraser and Walter Geikie.

Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 183. The last three all worked in London, where, together with Fraser, Burnet, Geddes and Carse, they have been seen as creating a recognisable Scottish school of artists around Wilkie. They all worked in a style described by Duncan Macmillan as \"slightly florid\", which applied the later richness of Wilkies later work to the subject of his early paintings of humorous and domestic \"cottage genre\". Simpson began as mainly a landscape painter, but later took up a version of Wilkie's style, producing genre works such as Goatherd's Cottage (1832). He also specialised in sporting scenes of men, dogs and ponies. Geikie is best known for his etchings, but produced some notable paintings. He often referenced Wilkie's work, particularly Pitlessie Fair. His Our Gudeman's a Druncken Carle, in which a drunken man is helped home by his friends is based on a group in Wilkie's The Village Festival, but it also drawn on Rembrandt's Deposition (1634) to create a sympathetic image.D.
