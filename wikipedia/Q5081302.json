A noted Antiquarian, Historian and Scholar. He was deeply imbued from youth in the native aristocratic literary and cultural tradition, yet his writings were clearly influenced by the Enlightenment and he was as familiar with the works of Locke, Hume, Montesquieu, Rousseau and Voltaire as he was with Gaelic lore. He was author of the highly influential Dissertations on the Ancient History of Ireland, first published in 1753. This was the first Irish history written in English by someone who had a command of the surviving Irish and colonial sources and who saw the past from an indigenous perspective. Its publication established O'Conor as the leading living expert on Ireland's history and antiquities. He is also credited with helping to generate an interest in Irish culture, history and antiquities among the Anglo-Irish establishment. He was a founder member in 1785 of the Royal Irish Academy. He also helped to foster a public awareness in English-speaking Ireland of the value of studying Irish, along with its associated poetry and folk-tales. As a Roman Catholic, O'Conor was affected for much of his life by the Penal Laws - which were intended to break the political power of Irish Catholics and were aimed in particular at the landowning class. Catholic gentry such as the O'Conors were denied access to careers in the army or law and could take no part in government at either national or local level. Many Catholic gentlemen had to go abroad to the Continent to further careers denied them at home. Given this background and his considerable intellectual powers, it is not surprising that O'Conor tried to advance the civil rights of Catholics marginalised by the Penal Laws. One of the most interesting features of his career was how his antiquarian and historical studies fuelled his political interests and his desire to see the laws eased or repealed. He started to write pamphlets advocating rights for Catholics from at least 1749 onwards. In 1756 he was one of the three founder members of the Catholic Committee, which tried to encourage the surviving Catholic gentry and clergy, as well as the emerging merchant class, to agitate peacefully against the Penal Laws. In many ways, the Catholic Committee was the beginning of the peaceful Catholic political activism that was to be so much a feature of nationalist politics in the 19th and early 20th centuries.", "******************  Denis Armar O'Conor, O'Conor Don (1912\u20132000).
