The Leconfield Estates would continue to own much of Petworth and the surrounding area and the family would be able to continue living in part of Petworth House. It was John Wyndham, 6th Baron Leconfield and since 1963 also 1st Baron Egremont, who negotiated the gift of the contents of the house, in particular the paintings and sculptures, into the property of the National Trust in lieu of accumulated death duties. The current Lord and Lady Egremont continue a tradition of unbroken occupancy at Petworth House today with Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont and his family living in the south wing, allowing much of the remainder of the House to be open to the public. Lady Egremont has restored the gardens."]}, {"page": "John Max Henry Scawen Wyndham, 7th Baron Leconfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont"]}, {"page": "Roxburghe Club", "response": ["The first female member was Mary, Viscountess Eccles, elected in 1985.
