Subsequently, at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) in May 1947, it was formally defined on a global basis. A key omission of both the MCC and ICC rulings was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively and it was stipulated in the ICC ruling that the definition \"will not have retrospective effect\".Wisden 1948, p. 813. Many historians and statisticians have subjectively classified chosen pre-1895 matches as first-class but these are unofficial ratings and differences of opinion among the experts has led to variations in published cricket statistics. The main problem with \"first-class cricket\" is that it can be a misleading concept as it is essentially statistical and may typically ignore the historical aspect of a match if statistical information is missing, as is invariably the case with matches played up to 1825. Nevertheless, the recognition of any match as first-class by a substantial source qualifies it as such and it follows that the teams, venues and players involved in such matches before 1895 are the equivalent of first-class teams, venues and players since 1895.

In January 1920 Cardus reported on two recitals by the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing, and apparently impressed Scott with the quality of his notice, although the accuracy of Cardus's summary of events has been questioned.O'Brien, pp. 136\u2013138. With the succession to Langford assured, and a significant increase in salary, Cardus was happy to devote his summers exclusively to cricket. He remained circumspect about his commitment to the sport: \"Never have I regarded my cricket as more than a means to an end; that end being always music\".Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 131\u201335 Nevertheless, he developed a style of cricket reporting that quickly lifted him to the forefront of contemporary sports writers. He did this, according to his fellow cricket writer Gerald Howat, by using imagery and metaphor to create \"a mythology of characters and scenes\". John Arlott described Cardus as \"the creat[or] of modern cricket writing\".", "Cardus's contribution to cricket writing has been acknowledged by various commentators on the game. John Arlott wrote: \"Before him, cricket was reported\u00a0... with him it was for the first time appreciated, felt, and imaginatively described.\"  Howat commented: \"He would have his imitators and parodists, and no serious cricket writer would remain unaffected by him\". His influence on his successors was more specifically acknowledged by Gibson:"]}, {"page": "E. V.

Lucas was a member of J. M. Barrie's team the \"Allahakbarries\", along with Henry Herbert La Thangue and Arthur Conan Doyle.

He bowled right arm fast-medium but also had what Arlott called \"the accuracy, spin and resource of a slow bowler\". Barnes's high delivery provided him with a lift off the pitch that forced even the best batsmen to play him at an awkward height. He was clever at concealing his pace and could produce deliveries that were both appreciably faster and slower than his usual fast-medium pace; and could bowl an effective yorker. Barnes considered himself essentially a spin bowler as he bowled both the off-break and the leg-break, but at a fast pace. Although technically formidable, Barnes allied his skillset to a hostile persona and great stamina which, Arlott says, \"were reflected in constant, unrelenting probing for a batsman's weakness and then attacking it by surprise, each ball fitting into a tactical pattern\".  In Barnes's era, the same ball would be used for the whole of a team's innings, with no new ball, although bowlers were assisted by the unpredictability of uncovered pitches.", "Bernard Hollowood drew two cartoons of Barnes, which appear in his book Cricket on the Brain. One depicts him leaping in the air as he appeals for a dismissal and with his index finger raised as though he himself is adjudicating on the appeal. It is entitled 'A.N. Other lbw Barnes.... 0'.Hollowood, p. 69. John Arlott wrote in his review of the book for the 1971 Wisden: ...his two caricatures of S.F. Barnes would seem transcendent if they were not outweighed by his chapter on that great bowler which is a fine passage of cricket literature... this is a book of many and well-cut facets.Arlott, Wisden 1971, p. 1070.", "In the 1963 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Barnes was selected by Neville Cardus as one of the \"Six Giants of the Wisden Century\".  This was a special commemorative selection requested by Wisden for its 100th edition. The other five players chosen were Don Bradman, W. G. Grace, Jack Hobbs, Tom Richardson and Victor Trumper. Soon afterwards, writing in the May 1963 edition of The Cricketer, John Arlott published a tribute to Barnes which commemorated his 90th birthday. Arlott wrote that of those who played with or against Barnes, \"(they) had no doubt that he stood alone \u2013 the greatest bowler that ever lived\".Arlott, Arlott on Cricket, p. 15. In 2008, when the \"ICC Best-Ever Test Championship Ratings\" were published, Barnes's retrospective rating of 932 at the end of the 1913/14 series was the highest ever achieved.

After a trial period, Frindall continued to score for the BBC until his death, watching all 246 Test matches in England from June 1966 to 2008.  He covered 377 Tests for the BBC in all, forming a close working relationship with John Arlott and Brian Johnston, providing continuity with later commentators such as Jonathan Agnew.

Leading up to the First Test of the three-match series, he had played 11 first-class games on the tour averaging 20.9 with the bat and 14.2 with the ball, having picked 44 wickets, the best for India thus far as a bowler. He made his debut at the Lord's opening the batting for India before being bowled out for 14 by England spinner Doug Wright. After \"long spells of bowling\" in England's first innings, Mankad top-scored for his team with 67 in the second innings. India went on to lose the match by ten wickets. However, Wisden wrote in praise of Mankad calling him a \"valuable all-round player\" alongside teammates Lala Amarnath and Vijay Hazare. Former England Test cricketer Patsy Hendren rated Mankad as India's \"best all-rounder\". In the Second Test in Manchester, Mankad claimed a five-wicket haul in England's first innings. He contributed 42 with the bat and picked two wickets in a drawn cause in the final Test at the Oval. Mankad completed the tour with a double of a thousand runs and hundred wickets, the first tourist to achieve the feat since Learie Constantine of the West Indies in 1928. He finished with 1,120 runs at 28.00 and 129 wickets at 20.76 apiece. John Arlott wrote of him: \"From his first over in England, Mankad was a good slow left-hander. By the end of the tour, there is little doubt that he was the best slow left-arm bowler in the world.\" Wisden chose him as one of its five Cricketers of the Year."]}]}}
