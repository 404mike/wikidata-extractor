Mayor, and stage adaptations of Tartuffe and The Idiot.  His original television screenplays include Running Late, After Pilkington, Unnatural Pursuits, and A Month in the Country.  His 1971 play Butley, produced by Codron, began a long creative partnership with Harold Pinter as director of both the play and the film versions and continued the partnership with the actor Alan Bates begun with Gray's 1967 television play Death of a Teddy Bear. In all Bates starred in 11 of Gray's works, while Pinter directed 10 separate productions of Gray's works for stage, film, and television, beginning with Butley. The last one was a stage production of The Old Masters, starring Peter Bowles and Edward Fox. (Converted to a memorial site after death of Alan Bates.) "]}, {"page": "F.M.
