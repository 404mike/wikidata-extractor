He was regarded as a radical thinker with unorthodox views, such as his claim that Jesus may have travelled to Britain during his lost years to study with the Druids.After attending St Edward's School, Oxford, Strachan went on to graduate with a degree in history from the University of Oxford, and a PhD in theology from New College, Edinburgh. The subject of his doctoral thesis was Edward Irving, a 19th-century Scottish divine denounced as a heretic. Strachan was active in the Iona Community, taught courses at the Office of Lifelong Learning and lectured in the Department of Architecture at the University of Edinburgh.Strachan wrote a number of books including Jesus the Master Builder: Druid Mysteries and the Dawn of Christianity, which was the basis of a 45-minute documentary titled And Did Those Feet (2009) by Ted Harrison.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph of Arimathea", "response": ["In 1989 A. W. Smith critically examined the accretion of legends around Joseph of Arimathea, by which the poem hymn of William Blake And did those feet in ancient time is commonly held as \"an almost secret yet passionately held article of faith among certain otherwise quite orthodox Christians\" and Smith concluded \"that there was little reason to believe that an oral tradition concerning a visit made by Jesus to Britain existed before the early part of the twentieth century\".Smith, \"'And Did Those Feet...?': The 'Legend' of Christ's Visit to Britain\" Folklore 100.1 (1989), pp. 63\u201383. Sabine Baring-Gould recounted a Cornish story how \"Joseph of Arimathea came in a boat to Cornwall, and brought the child Jesus with him, and the latter taught him how to extract the tin and purge it of its wolfram. This story possibly grew out of the fact that the Jews under the Angevin kings farmed the tin of Cornwall.\"S.

In its most developed version, Joseph, a tin merchant, visited Cornwall, accompanied by his nephew, the boy Jesus. Reverend C.C. Dobson (1879\u20131960) made a case for the authenticity of the Glastonbury legenda.Dobson, Did Our Lord Visit Britain as they say in Cornwall and Somerset? (Glastonbury: Avalon Press) 1936. The case was argued more recently by the Church of Scotland minister Dr Gordon Strachan (1934\u20132010) Gordon Strachan, Jesus The Master Builder: Druid Mysteries and The Dawn of Christianity (Edinburgh: Floris Books, 1998).   and by the former archaeologist Dennis Price.Dennis Price, The Missing Years of Jesus: The Greatest Story Never Told (Hay House Publishing, 2009).
