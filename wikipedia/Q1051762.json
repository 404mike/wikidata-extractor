He made over 500 appearances in the Football League for West Ham United, and ended his career with a short spell at Aldershot.\nRuffell was born in Doncaster, but moved south at an early age. He played for Essex Road School, Manor Park, Fullers, Chadwell Heath United, Manor Park Albion, East Ham and Wall End United, before West Ham signed him from the works team of the Ilford Electricity Board in March 1920. He made his League debut against Bury in December 1921.He was an ever-present during the 1924\u201325 season, and went on to make 548 senior appearances for the Hammers, a record that wasn't beaten until Bobby Moore surpassed it in 1973. He scored a total of 166 goals, placing him third in the club's all-time records, above many of West Ham's finest strikers despite his role on the left wing. He was the club's top scorer for the 1927\u201328 and 1934\u201335 seasons, although he didn't score a single goal during the 1921\u201322, 1932\u201333 and 1936\u201337 seasons.In 1923, he was part of the team that contested the first FA Cup Final to be staged at Wembley Stadium, known as The White Horse Final.In April 1926 he made his England international debut in a 1\u20130 defeat by Scotland in Manchester. He played for England on another five occasions, but saw competition from the likes of Cliff Bastin, Eric Brook and Eric Houghton for the left-wing spot.Ruffell left the east London club in 1937. He joined Aldershot for a short spell, where he made two League appearances and played his final game against Port Vale.His brother Bill was also a professional footballer who had been on the books at West Ham and played League football for Nelson during the 1927\u201328 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["# 548 Jimmy Ruffell (1921\u201337)", "# 166 Jimmy Ruffell (1921\u201337)"]}, {"page": "Eric Brook", "response": ["Brook's 'workmanlike' p29 club form earned him a call up to the England team in 1929 and he made his first appearance for his nation against Ireland. His debut performance for England was described as 'decidedly promising'. Brook went on to play for England a total of 18 times, scoring 10 goals. He may have played more times for his country, but faced competition, primarily from Arsenal's Cliff Bastin (who received 21 caps), but also from others, such as Aston Villa's Eric Houghton (who received 7 caps), Sheffield Wednesday's Ellis Rimmer (who received 4 caps) and West Ham's Jimmy Ruffell (who received six caps) and Jackie Morton (who received one cap). However, the versatility of Brook and Bastin meant that they often played together for England, usually with Bastin playing in the inside left position (in a game against Scotland in 1935 Bastin played at inside right). When they played together, Brook and Bastin would interchange at will, switches which often confused opposition defences. p96 Despite the rivalry, Brook and Bastin were in the latter's words 'always the greatest of friends'. The only players to have scored more goals for England, prior to the second world war, who did not play in the centre forward or inside forward positions were Cliff Bastin and Charles Bambridge. Only twelve players in total scored more goals for England than Brook prior to the war. In addition to playing for England, Brook often competed in trial matches for the Rest of England against the national team."]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["Pop Robson was the First Division's top scorer with 28 League goals, including eight doubles and a hat-trick, just one behind the post-war club record held by Geoff Hurst, who had left the Hammers for Stoke City the previous summer.

This performance was not equalled by the Hammers until the 1958\u20131959 season during Ted Fenton's tenure.

The following season, after promotion to the First Division, Richards made a further ten appearances, including a single FA Cup appearance that saw the Hammers bow out of the competition to Second Division Leeds United.

West Ham's game plan initially centred on the two fast-moving outside-forwards Dick Richards and Jimmy Ruffell, but Bolton set out from the start to keep the two players contained, rushing at them whenever they got the ball.  After just two minutes West Ham half-back Jack Tresadern became entangled in the crowd after taking a throw-in and was unable to return to the pitch immediately.  This gave Bolton's David Jack the opportunity to shoot for goal.  His shot beat West Ham goalkeeper Ted Hufton to give Bolton the lead, and hit a spectator who was standing pressed against the goal net, knocking him unconscious. Three minutes later Vic Watson received the ball a few yards in front of the Bolton goal but his shot flew over the crossbar. Eleven minutes into the game the crowd surged forward once again and a large number of fans encroached onto the pitch, leading to the suspension of play while the mounted police again cleared the playing area. A number of fans required first aid from members of the British Red Cross while the players looked on and awaited the resumption of play.
