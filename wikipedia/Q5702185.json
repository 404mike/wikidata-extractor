The Guardians Mike Phillips praised the writing and the subject matter, calling it Levy's \"big book\". Levy herself said in 2004: \"When I started Small Island I didn\u2019t intend to write about the war. I wanted to start in 1948 with two women, one white, one black, in a house in Earls Court, but when I asked myself, 'Who are these people and how did they get here?' I realised that 1948 was so very close to the war that nothing made sense without it. If every writer in Britain were to write about the war years there would still be stories to be told, and none of us would have come close to what really happened. It was such an amazing schism in the middle of a century. And Caribbean people got left out of the telling of that story, so I am attempting to put them back into it. But I am not telling it from only a Jamaican point of view. I want to tell stories from the black and white experience. It is a shared history.\" Small Island won three awards, namely the Whitbread Book of the Year, the Orange Prize and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize.
