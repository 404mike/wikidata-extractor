Nanovic set out to create a new hero combining elements of Doc Savage and the Shadow. They obtained advice from Lester Dent and Walter B. Gibson in the creation of the Avenger, and hired writer Paul Ernst. Both Dent and Gibson met with Ernst to give him advice on his stories, Dent focused on characterization and Gibson on plotting. The character of the Avenger, described by pulp expert Don Hutchison as \"clearly an effort to form a hybrid of the company's more successful creations\", echoed his forebears in other ways also. Whereas Doc Savage was known as \"The Man of Bronze\", the Avenger was described as \"The Man of Steel\". The Avenger's \"marksman's eyes\" echoed the \"burning eyes\" of the Shadow, who continued to be referred to as \"The Masked Avenger\".", "In Don Hutchison's estimation, the Avenger was following in big footsteps, and hamstrung by appearing too late in the day. Following the \"instant justice\" of The Shadow, the global stage of Doc Savage and other pulp heroes, the Avenger was, by 1939, \"simply an unnecessary commodity.\" \"Second best[,] he had tried harder... but the timing was all wrong\". Ultimately, Hutchison concludes, \"The world did not require another good ten-cent hero\".", "Don Hutchison suggests that \"Benson's extreme personal misfortune was probably the strongest motivation accorded any of the great pulp heroes,\" stemming as it did from the death of his family and his own \"death in life\". The stories, by veteran pulp/magazine writer Paul Ernst \"were well-plotted mysteries with mild science-fictional extrapolations\", albeit often appearing somewhat subdued when compared to rival publications such as The Spider and Operator #5. Benson was \"the master of the last-minute escape\", cool and intellectual, mentally \"the equal of Doc Savage\" but otherwise \"an average-sized man\". The plastic, malleable state of his otherwise immobile features allowed the character to physically reshape his face with his fingers into a likeness of any person, his features remaining in sculpted form \"until they were carefully put back into place.\" This ability, coupled with hair dyes and colored contact lenses, earned him the sobriquet \"The Man of a Thousand Faces\"."]}, {"page": "Walter Smith", "response": ["After success in his native Scotland, Smith's retirement lasted a month as he took the manager's job at Premier League club Everton in June 1998.Everton move for Moyes, BBC Sport, 13 March 2002 Initially Smith had been linked with the manager's job at Sheffield Wednesday,Smith's Everton years, BBC Sport, 13 March 2002 but false promises made to him by the Everton chairman of massive transfer funds and unlimited ambition lured Smith to Goodison Park.

Signed by manager Lou Macari, Allen made his debut on 26 August 1989 in a 3\u20132 home win against Plymouth Argyle. He scored the second goal, the other West Ham goals coming from David Kelly and Kevin Keen. Under manager Billy Bonds Allen was part of the team which won promotion to the First Division in 1991 and to the Premier League in 1993. Allen was frequently booked during his West Ham career and had a reputation for poor discipline. He was  sent off in a match on 17 January 1990 for a two-footed lunge on Derby County's Mark Patterson. During a game on 30 November 1991 against Sheffield Wednesday, managed by Allen's manager at Queens Park Rangers, Trevor Francis, Allen was booked after only 20 seconds of being on the pitch for a jump tackle on Carlton Palmer which saw Palmer carried off with a suspected broken leg. Although not sent-off, West Ham manager Bonds fined Allen a week's wages. During his time at Queens Park Rangers Allen had been refused permission, by manager Francis, to attend the birth of his first child as Allen would miss an important match. Allen attended the birth and was disciplined by the club. Under Bonds and Harry Redknapp Allen formed a successful partnership with Peter Butler with Allen contributing 34 goals from midfield in 234 appearances. However, by 1995 team discipline was poor at West Ham and with Allen playing alongside Julian Dicks, John Moncur and Don Hutchison bookings were commonplace. Allen was again dismissed in a match against Queens Park Rangers on 3 May 1995 after fouling Rufus Brevett.

Roeder's appointment was opposed by some supporters, who had expected a bigger name to replace Redknapp. Roeder received a \u00a315 million transfer kitty, and guided West Ham to seventh in his first season in charge. He signed David James from Aston Villa, Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0158epka from ACF Fiorentina for \u00a35.5 million, and Don Hutchison from Sunderland for \u00a35 million, a club record fee at the time.", "In the 2002\u201303 season, West Ham struggled. \u0158epka had serious disciplinary problems amassing ten yellow cards and one red card in thirty-two league appearances.

West Ham were bottom at Christmas and at that time no team had ever avoided relegation from that position. Despite the January signings of Rufus Brevett,  Lee Bowyer on a short-term deal, and Les Ferdinand, Roeder was unable to halt the team's slump. Roeder had a dispute with striker Paolo Di Canio after he substituted Di Canio in a match against West Bromwich Albion. In April 2003, Roeder suffered a brain tumour and was replaced by Trevor Brooking for the final three games of the season.
