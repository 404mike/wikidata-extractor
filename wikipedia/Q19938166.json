These cells do not express known \"clock genes\" including per and tim. Introduction of PER and TIM proteins into the cells does not cause rhythmicity of these cells as read out by abundance or phosphorylation of PER and TIM proteins. These cells were thus regarded as \"clock-less\" by the fly field until now. These findings substantiate the work above in demonstrating the TTFL model of the fly clockwork cannot explain the generation of circadian rhythms."]}, {"page": "John S. O'Neill", "response": ["For his post-doctoral research, O\u2019Neill investigated circadian rhythms in plants and algae with Andrew Millar at the University of Edinburgh and then subsequently in human cells with Akhilesh Reddy at the Institute for Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge. During this time, O\u2019Neill contributed to a number of papers on non-transcriptional mechanisms of circadian timekeeping, most notably a letter and an article in same edition of Nature showing that transcriptional cycles are not essential for circadian rhythms in human and algal cells, which have been cited over 700 and 400 times respectively, according to Google Scholar. These observations were subsequently independently replicated  and extended but were considered controversial at the time since transcriptional feedback repression had been thought essential for circadian rhythms in eukaryotes."]}, {"page": "Akhilesh", "response": ["*Akhilesh Reddy, British physician-scientist at the Francis Crick Institute in London"]}]}}
