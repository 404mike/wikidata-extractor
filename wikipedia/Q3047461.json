It was originally found buried in the sand of a beach near Plymouth, England at extreme low water of a spring tide; the shore here consists of patches of Zostera seagrass separated by patches of bare sand, and the worm was only ever found in the bare sand areas, nor was it ever found in other habitats near Plymouth. The specific name was chosen because when they were swimming, both the worm and its planktonic larva were continually wriggling.", "Category:Taxa named by Edgar Johnson Allen"]}]}}
