This brought to an end the club's then-record streak of 16 games unbeaten. Four days later Vale recorded a 2\u20131 win over Bradford Park Avenue at the Horsfall Stadium despite Reg Potts being injured with a swollen ankle early in the match. A 2\u20130 home win over Workington on 19 September began a sequence of five clean sheets, with Jim Elsby standing in for Potts as Steele changed the starting line-up for the first time in eight games \u2013 this brought Potts' run of 73 consecutive appearances to an end. The defensive fivesome of keeper Ray King, Tommy Cheadle, Reg Potts, Stan Turner and Roy Sproson began to be known as 'the Iron Curtain' or 'the Steele Curtain' (a play on the manager's name). A 21 September game against nearby unbeaten Crewe Alexandra was billed as a 'crunch clash' between first and second, and a Sproson goal on 87 minutes won the match for the Vale. For the return a week later a stadium record 17,883 packed into Gresty Road to witness a goalless draw at Crewe. The attendance figures were helped by the management team of the Crewe Works, who allowed their workforce to leave work an hour early in order to make it for the 5:10pm kick-off. The draw was achieved despite injuries to Albert Leake, Hayward and John Cunliffe, who were replaced by Derek Tomkinson, Roland Lewis and Mick Hulligan."]}, {"page": "John Ingham", "response": ["John Ingham may refer to:", "* John Ingham (footballer) (1924\u20132000), English footballer", "* John Ingham (businessman) (1928\u20132003), Australian businessman", "* John Ingham, English musical journalist, better known under his pseudonym Jonh Ingham"]}]}}
