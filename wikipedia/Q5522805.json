He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler.  He has played first-class cricket for both Yorkshire (1998), and more regularly and recently, for Nottinghamshire (2000-2008).\nClough played extensively throughout Nottinghamshire's promotion-winning season of 2004, earning a new contract until the end of 2006. Clough's tidy bowling and fielding agility made him useful in limited-overs cricket. It was in the one-day format where he was used most frequently in 2005, and despite only playing one game in Nottinghamshire's County Championship campaign, he remained useful in this format until his retirement in 2008.\nClough played for Lincolnshire in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship in 2008 and 2009.\nClough is now working as a teacher in a school in Batley. He decided to become a teacher after getting injured whilst he was playing cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["The relegation battle in the National League tightened further, as the match at Trent Bridge became a low-scoring thriller, where Gloucestershire Gladiators failed to put away two good positions \u2013 first they collapsed from 75 for 2 to make 116, then they allowed Nottinghamshire to hit 19 for the last wicket.
