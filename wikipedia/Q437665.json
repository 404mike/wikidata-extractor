By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater who likes to smoke weed, and as the more sensible and responsible friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's Asperger syndrome makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic tricks to make friends.
