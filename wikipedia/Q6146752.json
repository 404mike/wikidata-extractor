They became only the 9th non-League side to reach the 5th round since 1945. They hosted Arsenal in the last 16 of the competition on 20 February where they lost 0\u20132. The game sparked a betting controversy surrounding the actions of Sutton's reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw, who ate a 'pastry' on the bench after Sun Bets offered odds of 8\u20131 against him eating a pie during the match. Shaw offered his resignation over the incident and Sutton were forced to play defender Simon Downer in goal in their next league game, against Torquay United, when first-choice goalkeeper Ross Worner was injured in the 15th minute.

In the January transfer window he released Graeme Montgomery and Anthony Pulis, whilst making four new loan signings in defenders Troy Brown and Sonny Bradley, midfielder Josh Payne, and striker Charlie Collins.

He also signed Stefan Payne, Wilko Risser and Josh Payne, as well as loanees Ben Smith, Darren Murphy, Michael Doughty, and Rob Sinclair. To make room for these signings he offloaded Jermaine McGlashan, Jamie Collins, Luke Guttridge, Chris Doig and Aaron Brown.
