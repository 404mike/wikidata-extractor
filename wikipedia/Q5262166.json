Douglas Malcolm (died 1967) and Dorothy Vera (died 1964; n\u00e9e Elliston-Taylor), Malcolm was educated at Eton College and Merton College, Oxford. As a child he expressed an interest in film, often going to the newsreel cinema on Victoria station. He worked for several decades as a film critic for The Guardian, having previously been an amateur jockey and the paper's first horse racing correspondent. In 1977, he was a member of the jury at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. In the mid-1980s he was host of The Film Club on BBC2, which was dedicated to art house films, and was director of the London Film Festival for several years.\nAfter leaving The Guardian in 2000, he published his final series of articles, The Century of Films, in which he discusses films he admires from his favourite directors from around the world. He became chief film critic for the Evening Standard, before being replaced in 2009 by novelist Andrew O'Hagan. He still contributes film reviews for the newspaper, but it emerged in July 2013 that his contribution to the title was to be reduced further.In 2008 he was a member of the jury at the 30th Moscow International Film Festival.Malcolm is president of the British Federation of Film Societies and the International Film Critics' Circle. In 2003 he published an autobiographical book, Family Secrets, which recounts how in 1917 his father shot his mother's lover dead, but was found not guilty of murder.\nMalcolm has been married to the journalist and author Sarah Gristwood since 1994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wild Strawberries (film)", "response": ["In a 1963 interview with Cinema magazine, director Stanley Kubrick listed the film as his second favourite of all time.

No doubt the film viewer will find himself somewhere in some form in Bhansali's Devdas. And that is a great achievement.\" In the words of Empire magazine: \"Devdas lacks Bollywood's broader comic touches but in its field, it's the event movie of the year.\" According to the review, Rai \"proves she has the acting talent to back up her flawless looks\". Giving the film two stars, the critic and film historian Derek Malcolm of The Guardian criticized its production design, which he described as \"tacky\". The Chicago Reader weekly's J. R. Jonas added, \"... the sets and costumes are intoxicating, and whenever the tabla kicked in, I understood why people of my parents' generation used to dream about the movies.\""]}, {"page": "Pakeezah", "response": ["Over decades, critical reception to Pakeezah has been significantly improved with most praise went to Kumari's performance; newer critics have described the film as \"iconic\", a classic, and a magnum opus. In the 1988 book One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography, Anil Srivastava and Shampa Banerjee wrote the film recreates \"a lost era of decadence, and the world of high-class courtesans who were artistes in their own right\", accompanied by \"an incredible romance which cannot be contained within a rational or a casual framework\". In 1999, Derek Malcolm of The Guardian described it as a mixture of poetry, fantasy and nostalgia, contending, \"If there is nothing special about the plot, the way it is accomplished is often astounding. Amrohi ... saturates the screen not only with some amazing colour photography but with a swirling romanticism that somehow never tips over into the laughable.\" The review was included by Malcolm in his book, A Century of Films: Derek Malcom's Personal Best (2000)."]}]}}
