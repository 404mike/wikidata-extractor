His great strength was a thorough understanding of economics and statistics, particularly the operation of labour markets and the limitations of available statistics. This set him apart from\nmost other academic industrial relations specialists. He was an inspiring lecturer and his tutorials and post-graduate supervisions were challenging and provocative as students were prodded and persuaded into thinking.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lambeth Academy", "response": ["* Prof Herbert Arthur Frederick Turner, Montague Burton Professor of Industrial Relations from 1963 to 1983 at the University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Montague Burton Professor of Industrial Relations", "response": ["* 1964\u20131983 Herbert Arthur Frederick Turner", "* 1961\u201363 Herbert Arthur Frederick Turner"]}]}}
