Brighton finished fourth at the end of the 1975\u201376 season, three points shy of promotion, and Taylor quit the club. Incoming manager Alan Mullery had planned to also play in midfield for the club but after witnessing Horton in his first training session he came to the conclusion that Horton would provide the necessary leadership and skill on the pitch, so Mullery retired as a player to concentrate fully on management. For his performances at both Vale and Brighton, Horton was named on the PFA Team of the Year, along with Brighton teammates Graham Cross and Peter Ward. The \"Seagulls\" finished second in 1976\u201377 under Mullery's stewardship, and thus were promoted into the Second Division. Mullery was however disappointed in his players after they won only one of their final four games to miss out on the chance of winning the divisional title.
