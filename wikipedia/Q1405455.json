Lyons is the Wallis Professor of Mathematics, a fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford and a Faculty Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute. He was the director of the Oxford-Man Institute from 2011 to 2015 and the president of the London Mathematical Society from 2013 to 2015. His mathematical contributions have been to probability, harmonic analysis, the numerical analysis of stochastic differential equations, and quantitative finance.
