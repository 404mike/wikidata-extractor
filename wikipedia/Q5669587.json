He made his debut on 2 October 1897, with Samuel Meston moving forward to right-half to accommodate him, thus displacing William McMillan, who had been ever-present in the previous season.

During the first half the play was fast-paced, end-to-end and goalless until Harry Haynes left the field with a knee injury. He resumed after the interval, limping heavily, but during his absence Bury took a 2\u20130 lead, which they were to double before Lewis scored a late consolation. Two days later, in the replay of the match abandoned for bad weather, Small Heath's forwards pressed hard early on, but faded after Hugh Goldie scored somewhat against the run of play and Everton won 3\u20130. The Liverpool Mercury picked out debutant Tom Farnall as making a good impression at right-half. An improved performance secured a draw at home to Sheffield Wednesday, Leake scoring a headed goal, his first for the club. Wednesday had a goal from a free kick disallowed because the ball had not touched another player on its way into the net, though Meates made a desperate attempt to save it after it appeared to have deflected off Fred Spiksley.\"The League Championship\". p. 2, \"Comments on Saturday's Games\". p. 3, and ", "The Nottinghamshire Guardian suggested Small Heath would \"have to greatly improve their present team if they are to make a very prominent display even in [the second] division next season.\" Harry Haynes moved on to Southern League club Southampton St Mary's, Ted Devey left for Burton Wanderers, and Adam Fraser returned to Scotland, but the major loss was that of Fred Wheldon.
