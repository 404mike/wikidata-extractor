After failing to break into the team, he spent much of his later career with the club away on loan, before transferring to Gillingham in 2019.

Lee's persistent shoulder injury could be traced back to the ruptured biceps he suffered in 2005 and he admitted in 2011 that playing through injuries had caused lasting damage. Lee spent the 2014\u201315 season as third-choice goalkeeper behind David Button and Jack Bonham and after falling to fourth-choice behind Development Squad goalkeeper Mark Smith, he departed on loan in late March 2015.

The departure of Simon Moore to Cardiff City and injury to Richard Lee saw Button begin the season as manager Uwe R\u00f6sler's first-choice goalkeeper. Button started each of Brentford's opening six league games, but disaster struck on 7 September against Bradford City when with the score at 0\u20130, Button received a straight red card for a challenge on Bradford player Nahki Wells just outside the penalty box after 26 minutes. During his three-match suspension, Jack Bonham and then the fit-again Richard Lee took over the goalkeeping position. Button made his next appearance in a 1\u20130 defeat to Rotherham United on 5 October and regained his position as first-choice goalkeeper. An open forum between players and management in the dressing room after a 2\u20131 defeat to Stevenage on 12 October saw a turnaround in the team's fortunes and the beginning of a run of nine consecutive wins in the league, with Button appearing in eight of those matches and keeping seven clean sheets. With Button as a virtual ever-present, the Bees secured automatic promotion to the Championship after a 1\u20130 win over Preston North End on 18 April 2014. Button made 45 appearances and kept 20 clean sheets in league matches during the 2013\u201314 season.
