These songs, recorded in New York City at the Axis Studios, Power Station and Whorga Musica, were the only tracks recorded outside the UK.;  Minogue said, \"I was feeling a bit like a ping-pong ball for a while, with the American and English both wanting different things.\" Minogue recorded a song entitled \"Intuition\" during these sessions, which was shelved until 2019, when Harry gave the demo to American singer Liz for her album Planet Y2K. Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, better known as Pet Shop Boys, were approached by Minogue's camp after the pair finished work on Very (1993). They declined initially, but Lowe came up with a set of chords that Tennet found similar to Minogue's previous work with SAW and suggested they turn it into a song for her.;  The demo for \"Falling\" was sent to Deconstruction, where it was reworked by Fire Island, an English music duo made up of Pete Heller and Terry Farley. Tennet found the result very different from the original demo, saying, \"It doesn't really have the same tune in it, for instance, and they haven't put the chorus in, but I suppose that's very modern.\" Minogue's label mate M People produced \"Time Will Pass You By\" for Kylie Minogue but could not commit to do more because of a busy schedule. Gerry DeVeaux, songwriter and Kravitz's cousin, produced and co-wrote \"Surrender\" with composer Charlie Mole.;  Three of the songs on the album are cover versions of largely unknown tracks: \"Where Has The Love Gone?\", \"Time Will Pass You By\" and \"Where Is the Feeling?\"."]}, {"page": "List of house music artists", "response": ["*Pete Heller"]}, {"page": "Regret (New Order song)", "response": ["The single was released worldwide in a variety of formats.
