It was named Mimosa Hall by later owner General A. J. Hansell. It was eventually purchased in 1916 by noted Georgia architect Neel Reid who designed renovations of the house and its gardens.  The house was purchased in 1947 by Granger Hansell, great-grandson of A. J. Hansell, and up to 2017 it had remained in the Hansell family.  In 2017 it was for sale, and the Georgia Trust was concerned its acreage might be developed, and was offering inducements for a new owner to preserve the house and property. On June 12, 2017, the Roswell city council voted to purchase the property. The sale went through in August 2017, and there were later plans for the mansion to be retrofitted to become the \"nation's oldest 'net zero' home\". Includes photos. ()"]}]}}
