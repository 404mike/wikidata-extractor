In the Tate's own evaluation he was the \"least successful\" of their directors. His time there was frustrated by his stymied ambition as a painter and he declined into alcoholism, culminating in a drunken outburst at an official dinner in Paris. Although his art policies were more advanced than previously at the Tate and embraced Impressionism, he stopped short of accepting newer artistic movements like Surrealism and German Expressionism, thus earning the scorn of critics such as Douglas Cooper. He retired on the grounds of ill health and resumed his career as a flower painter until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tate", "response": ["* James Bolivar Manson (1930 to 1938)"]}, {"page": "Art of the United Kingdom", "response": ["File:Manson-Lucien-Pissaro-Reading.jpg|James Bolivar Manson, Lucien Pissarro Reading c. 1913"]}, {"page": "Alleyn's School", "response": ["*James Bolivar Manson (1879\u20131945), painter and director of Tate Gallery, 1930\u20131938", "* James Bolivar Manson"]}, {"page": "Four Seasons Hotel George V", "response": ["*James Bolivar Manson"]}, {"page": "National Museum of Serbia", "response": ["Includes painters usually from the late 19th century, mostly impressionist and post-impressionist.
