Like many artists working in the Americas, Brunias returned to Britain around 1775 in order to promote and sell his growing collection of work. In 1777 and 1779, three of his West Indian paintings were shown at the Royal Academy. He followed this accomplishment by publishing engravings of his West Indian paintings, some of which were \"by his own hand\". During this time he also created wall paintings of \"Caribbean aborigines\" for the antelibrary at Stowe House. During Brunias' absence from the West Indies, Dominica and St. Vincent were captured and occupied by the French; Britain did not regain the colonies until the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1783. Brunias was finally able to return to Dominica in 1784, and remained there until his death on the island of Dominica in 1796. He returned to Dominica and St. Vincent with commissions, including one for a set of botanical drawings from Alexander Anderson, curator of the Botanic Gardens of St. Vincent."]}, {"page": "A.Anderson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Anderson (botanist)"]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (A\u2013C)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Anderson\"|William Anderson, William Anderson and Alexander Anderson"]}]}}
