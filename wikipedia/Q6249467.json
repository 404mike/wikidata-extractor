Austin Woolrych explored the issue of \"dictatorship\" in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the nation as a whole. He argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell's rule stemmed less from its military origin or the participation of army officers in civil government than from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government.Woolrych, Austin (1990). \"The Cromwellian Protectorate: a Military Dictatorship?\" in History 1990 75(244): 207\u201331, .

In a decade, the ownership of two-fifths of the land mass was transferred from several thousand Irish Catholic landowners to British Protestants. The gap between Irish and the English views of the seventeenth-century conquest remains unbridgeable and is governed by G. K.

The term \"British\" had also never applied to Ireland until at least the late 16th century\"Geographers may have formed the habit of referring to the archipelago consisting of Britain and Ireland as the Britannic isles, but there never had been a historical myth linking the islands. Medieval historians, such as the twelfth-century Geoffrey of Monmouth, had developed the idea that Britain (i.e. England, Scotland, and Wales) had first been settled by Trojan refugees fleeing after the capture and destruction of their city by the Greeks. The founding monarch \u2014 Brutus \u2014 had then divided up the island between his three sons, the eldest (Albion) inheriting England and the younger sons Scotland and Wales. This permitted English antiquarians to claim a superiority for the English nation and the English Crown. In the fourteenth century the Scots developed their own counter-myth which acknowledged that Trojans had first occupied England and Wales, but asserted that Scotland had been occupied by colonists from Greece \u2013 the conquerors of Troy. Faced by such Scottish counter-myths and by the scepticism bred of humanist scholarship, few people took any of these historical claims seriously by 1600. English claims that kings of Scotland had regularly recognised the feudal suzerainty of the English Crown had to be abandoned in 1603 when the Scottish royal house inherited the English Crown. But the fact is that many of the inhabitants of Britain \u2013 especially intellectuals around the royal Courts \u2013 had for centuries conceptualised a relationship which bound them together into a common history. There was no historical myths binding Ireland into the story. The term 'Britain' was widely understood and it excluded Ireland; there was no geopolitical term binding together the archipelago.\" John Morrill, 1996, The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain, Oxford University Press: Oxford.  \"When I refer to the composite monachy ruled over by James VI and I and by King Charles I, it is always described as Britain and Ireland, and I deliberately avoid the politically loaded phrase 'the British Isles' not least because this was not a normal usage in the political discourse of the time.\" Canny, Nicholas (2001). op. cit., p. viii. and onwards. This period coincided with the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the subsequent Cromwellian activities in Ireland, the Williamite accession in Britain and the Williamite War in Ireland\u2014all of which resulted in severe impact on the Irish people, landowners and native aristocracy. From that perspective, the term \"British Isles\" is not a neutral geographical term but an unavoidably political one. Use of the name \"British Isles\" is often rejected in the Republic of Ireland, because some claim its use implies a primacy of British identity over all the islands outside the United Kingdom, including the Irish state and the Crown dependencies of the Isle of Man and Channel Islands, that was historically dominating and is currently inaccurate, since Ireland is neither Britain nor British.The readers' editor of The Guardian, Ian Mayes, noted indirect reports of concerns. \"Where are we?\", The Guardian, 11 August 2001.On 18 July 2004 The Sunday Business Post  questioned the use of British Isles as a purely geographic expression, noting:"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Academics of the University of Cambridge", "response": ["John Morrill (historian)not yet classified"]}, {"page": "Altrincham Grammar School for Boys", "response": ["* Prof John Morrill, Professor of British and Irish History at the University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Ford Lectures", "response": ["* 2005\u201306 John Morrill, Living with Revolution"]}, {"page": "John Dury", "response": ["Up to 1633, Dury had Anglican support from George Abbot.
