Its editor-in-chief is Drew Rose. While focusing on UK political affairs, it also has a \"Global\" section, a satire section (\"Off the Perch\"), and \"Science\", \"Environment\", and \"Health\" sections. Founded in 2015 by Kerry-Anne Mendoza and her wife Nancy Mendoza, the website increased in popularity around the time of the 2017 United Kingdom general election.", "According to editor-in-chief Kerry-Anne Mendoza, The Canary was created in October 2015 with five founding members in an attempt to \"diversify the media\". The website was funded by advertising and monthly contributions from around 1,500 supporters in August 2016. It published 9,000 articles in its first two years. According to Mendoza, a major factor motivating The Canary founders was scepticism of the mainstream media, a scepticism that was shared by Jeremy Corbyn, the-then leader of the Labour Party. In his first address as Labour leader, he attacked pundits for not understanding the discontent among many ordinary British voters, and talked about the \"power of social media\". Following the 2017 United Kingdom general election, the BBC reported that websites \"such as The Canary, The Skwawkbox, and Another Angry Voice are making a huge impact and earning a massive following\", and such sites were considered to have contributed to sensationalist reporting of the election.", "Describing her website to Journalism.co.uk, Canary editor-in-chief Kerry-Anne Mendoza said: \"For us, this is ultimately about democracy. Informed consent in the public is the bedrock of democracy, and if that informed consent isn't there because people aren't aware of the kind of information that they need to be, they won't be equipped to make the decent democratic decisions that they need to, say, for example, on climate change, the justice system, or whether austerity is a positive economic policy.\" Mendoza stated it was \"a complete coincidence\" that the website was created shortly after Corbyn's leadership victory, and added: \"We don't have any affiliations with political parties, we don't have any affiliations with political organisations, and we're not actually ostensibly left-wing.\" She called the site's editorial stance \"a counterpoint to conservative media\" and \"broadly liberal\". Mendoza also stated that The Canary was \"biased in favour of social justice, equal rights \u2013 those are non-negotiable things. We're in this as an issue-driven organisation. ... Every press organisation has an editorial stance and we\u2019re certainly no different.\""]}, {"page": "Mendoza, Kerry-Anne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kerry-Anne Mendoza"]}]}}
