During the Second World War he commanded the Second Army in north west Europe. A highly professional and dedicated career soldier who made his reputation in active service, Miles Dempsey was highly thought of by both his subordinates and superiors, most notably Bernard Montgomery, although he remains less well known than Montgomery or subordinates like Brian Horrocks and Richard O'Connor.\nA 1915 graduate of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Dempsey was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Berkshire Regiment. As a junior officer, he fought on the Western Front during the First World War, where he was wounded, and was awarded the Military Cross. After the war he served in Iraq during the Iraqi revolt of 1920, in Iran during the Russian Civil War, and in India. \nDuring the Second World War Dempsey formed a close relationship with Montgomery. He commanded the 13th Brigade in the Battle of France in 1940, and then spent the next two years training troops in England. He commanded the Eighth Army's XIII Corps in the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy in 1943. He commanded the Second Army during the Battle of Normandy and made rapid advances in the subsequent campaign in Northern France and Belgium.\nAfter the war he commanded the Fourteenth Army in the Far East, and the Middle East Command during the Greek Civil War and the Palestine Emergency. He retired from the Army in 1947, and was involved in horse racing. He bred and raced his own horses, and was Chairman of the Racecourse Betting Control Board from 1947 to 1951.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bernard Montgomery", "response": ["Hampered by stormy weather and the bocage terrain, Montgomery had to ensure that Rommel focused on the British in the east rather than the Americans in the west, who had to take the Cotentin Peninsula and Brittany before the Germans could be trapped by a general swing east. Montgomery told General Sir Miles Dempsey, the commander of the 2nd British Army: \"Go on hitting, drawing the German strength, especially some of the armour, onto yourself \u2013 so as to ease the way for Brad [Bradley].\" The Germans had deployed 12 divisions, of which six were Panzer divisions, against the British while deploying eight divisions, of which three were Panzer divisions, against the Americans. By the middle of July Caen had not been taken, as Rommel continued to prioritise prevention of the break-out by British forces rather than the western territories being taken by the Americans. This was broadly as Montgomery had planned, albeit not with the same speed as he outlined at St Paul's, although as the American historian Carlo D'Este pointed out the actual situation in Normandy was \"vastly different\" from what was envisioned at the St. Paul's conference, as only one of four goals outlined in May had been achieved by 10 July.", "Hitler waited too long to order his soldiers to retreat from Normandy, leading Montgomery to write: \"He [Hitler] refused to face the only sound military course. As a result the Allies caused the enemy staggering losses in men and materials\". Knowing via Ultra that Hitler was not planning to retreat from Normandy, Montgomery, on 6 August 1944, ordered an envelopment operation against Army Group B\u2014with the First Canadian Army under Harry Crerar to advance towards Falaise, the Second British Army under Miles Dempsey to advance towards Argentan, and the Third American Army under George S. Patton to advance to Alen\u00e7on. On 11 August, Montgomery changed his plan, with the Canadians to take Falaise and to meet the Americans at Argentan. The First Canadian Army launched two operations, Operation Totalize on 7 August, which advanced only  in four days in the face of fierce German resistance, and Operation Tractable on 14 August, which finally took Falaise on 17 August. In view of the slow Canadian advance, Patton requested permission to take Falaise, but was refused by Bradley on 13 August, which prompted much controversy, many historians arguing that Bradley lacked aggression and that Montgomery should have overruled Bradley."]}, {"page": "Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)", "response": ["*Sir Miles Dempsey, general, British Army"]}, {"page": "1896", "response": ["* December 15 \u2013 Miles Dempsey, British general (d. 1969)"]}, {"page": "Operation Market Garden", "response": ["After major defeats in Normandy in the summer of 1944, remnants of German forces withdrew across France and the Low Countries towards the German border by the end of August.

In the earlier fighting in Normandy, Crocker and the commander of the British Second Army, Lieutenant General Sir Miles Dempsey had expressed doubts about the physical and mental fitness of the commander of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, Major-General Rod Keller. This was disappointing, as Keller was being considered as a replacement for Burns in Italy. Montgomery responded by moving the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division to Simonds's II Canadian Corps, so Canadian officers could take action. Simonds spoke to Keller, and agreed with the British assessment, but took no action. Keller was seriously wounded by American bombers on 8 August, and was succeeded by Major-General Daniel Spry ten days later.
