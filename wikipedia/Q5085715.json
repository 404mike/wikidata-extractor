Following that set-back he fell out of favour at Leeds Road and Stoke manager Tom Mather wasted no time in bringing him back to the Victoria Ground in February 1932. Davies' return was met with approval by the club's supporters and was key in helping Stoke to win Second Division title in 1932\u201333.
