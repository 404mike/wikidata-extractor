Charlotte and Anne made a pact never to marry for fear of passing on insanity to their children. (One author speculates that Charlotte was \"almost certainly chastely lesbian\".) Mew had a strong sense of style: her friend and editor Alida Monro remembers her wearing distinctive red worsted stockings in the winter months, and she insisted on buying her black, button-up boots (in a tiny size 2) from Pinet's bootmakers in Mayfair; items left to different friends in her will (such as a 'small three drop diamond pendant' and a 'scarlet Chinese embroidered scarf') also suggest a keen interest in fashion.Copus, Julia, This Rare Spirit: A Life of Charlotte Mew.
