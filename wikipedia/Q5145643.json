He spent thirteen seasons in the Football League and two in the North American Soccer League.\nWaldron spent his youth in Oldham, Lancashire, beginning his career with nearby Bury, making 20 appearances. He then joined Chelsea before the 1967\u201368 season. Nine games into the season, Burnley purchased his contract for \u00a330,000. He made his Burnley debut on 28 October 1967. He quickly became a fixture at centre back and was named captain in his second season with the club. Burnley won the Second Division in 1973 and were invited to play in the 1973 FA Charity Shield in which Waldron scored the winning goal against Manchester City. He ultimately played nine years and 308 games for Burnley before club turmoil in 1976 led the team to release the manager Jimmy Adamson and several players including Waldron. He then moved to Manchester United, for whom he made just three appearances before the Adamson-managed Sunderland purchased his contract. After two years with Sunderland, Waldron moved to the United States to play for the Tulsa Roughnecks. After spells with the Philadelphia Fury and Atlanta Chiefs, he moved back to England to play for Rochdale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1948", "response": ["** Colin Waldron, English football defender"]}, {"page": "Tulsa Roughnecks (1978\u20131984)", "response": ["* Colin Waldron (1978) "]}, {"page": "Cliviger", "response": ["* Colin Waldron, former Burnley FC defender.This is Lancashire (news archive) Accessed 2010"]}, {"page": "The Hathershaw College", "response": ["* Colin Waldron, football player - played for Chelsea, Burnley, Manchester United and Sunderland football clubs."]}, {"page": "Colin Blant", "response": ["Born in Rawtenstall, Blant started his career with local club Rossendale United before joining his first Football League club Burnley in 1964.
