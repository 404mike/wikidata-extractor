He stated in his autobiography that he had been involved in between 2,000 and 3,000 unlicensed fights. In his prime, the 6-foot-3-inch (191 cm) tall McLean weighed over 20 stone (280 lb; 130 kg) and was considered the \"unofficial heavyweight champion of Great Britain\".Along with being an unlicensed boxer, McLean was an enforcer in London's criminal underworld.
