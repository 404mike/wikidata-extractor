The regiment, commanded by Captain William Morris, was in the first line of cavalry on the left flank during the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854. The brigade drove through the Russian artillery before smashing straight into the Russian cavalry and pushing them back; it was unable to consolidate its position, however, having insufficient forces and had to withdraw to its starting position, coming under further attack as it did so. The regiment lost 7 officers and 67 men in the debacle. The regiment went on to take part in the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854. After the inception of the Victoria Cross in 1856, three members of the regiment received the award for acts of gallantry in the charge: These were Troop Sergeant-Major John Berryman, Sergeant-Major Charles Wooden, and Sergeant John Farrell."]}, {"page": "William Morris (disambiguation)", "response": ["William Morris (1834\u20131896) was a British writer, designer and socialist.", "* William Morris, known as Haldreyn (born 1937), Cornish poet", "*Captain William Morris, a fictional character in the Richard Sharpe novels", "*William Morris (actor) (1861\u20131936), American actor", "*William Morris (glass artist) (born 1957), American glass artist", "*William Morris Agency, a Hollywood talent agency", "*William Morris Endeavor, a Hollywood talent agency", "*William Morris Fine Arts, ex-owner of the Morris Singer foundry", "*William Morris (Canadian businessman) (1786\u20131858), businessman and political figure in Upper Canada", "*William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield (1877\u20131963), British motor manufacturer and philanthropist", "*William Morris Jr. (1899\u20131989), American talent agent and president of the William Morris Agency", "*William Morris (British Army officer) (1820\u20131858), British soldier who rode in the Charge of the Light Brigade", "*William Morris (Irish mayor), mayor of Galway, 1527\u201328", "*William Morris (British politician) (1811\u20131877), Liberal MP for Carmarthen Boroughs, and banker", "*William Morris (Baptist minister) (1843\u20131922), minister in South Wales", "*William Morris (Irish priest), Dean of Clogher, 1959\u20131962", "*William Morris (Church of Scotland minister) (1925\u20132013), Church of Scotland minister and author", "*William Morris (English cricketer) (1873\u20131945), English cricketer", "*William Morris (Australian cricketer) (born 1918), Australian cricketer", "*William Morris (British sport shooter), completed in 1908 Olympics", "*William Morris (American sport shooter) (born 1939), American Olympic sport shooter (1964)", "*Speedy Morris (William Morris, born 1942), American college basketball coach", "*William Morris, litblogger at A Motley Vision"]}, {"page": "The Charge of the Light Brigade (1912 film)", "response": ["The film opens with two young British cavalry officers, Captain William Morris and Captain Louis Nolan, leaving home and bidding farewell to their wives in the parlor of the Nolans' residence.
