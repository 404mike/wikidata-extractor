He rose to prominence as a novelist in the late 1990s with his novel The Beach, which led some critics to call Garland a key voice of Generation X. He subsequently received praise for the screenplays of the films 28 Days Later (2002), Sunshine (2007) (both directed by Danny Boyle), Never Let Me Go (2010), and Dredd (2012). He co-wrote the video game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West (2010) and was a story supervisor on DmC: Devil May Cry (2013).\nIn 2014, Garland made his directorial debut with Ex Machina, a science fiction-thriller which explores the emergence of artificial general intelligence. The film earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and won three BIFA awards for Best Screenplay, Best Director, and Best British Independent Film. His second film, 2018's Annihilation, based on the 2014 novel by Jeff VanderMeer, was also a critical success, but a box office failure.

The latter, an adaption of Alex Garland's 1996 novel of the same name, saw him play an American backpacking tourist looking for the perfect way of life in a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand. Budgeted at $50\u00a0million, the film earned about three times more at the box office, but was negatively reviewed by critics, and earned him a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor. Todd McCarthy of Variety thought DiCaprio was \"perfectly watchable\" but his character was \"too much the American Everyman\" and lacked the uniqueness to make him dimensional. In the mid-1990s, DiCaprio appeared in the mostly improvised black-and-white short film Don's Plum as a favor to aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb expanded it to a full-length feature, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked in the US and Canada by court order, arguing they never intended to make it a theatrical release.
