His father was a brewer of the firm of Charringtons which was based at the Anchor Brewery in Mile End East London. Charrington became one of the partners in the family firm, and became its chairman on the death of his brother Edward in 1888.  He was also a Vice-President of the Brewers' Society. In 1881 he lived at Great Gearies, Barkingside but was subsequently of Hunsdon, Hertfordshire.\nCharrington was elected MP for Mile End in 1885. He owed his election in the Conservative cause to the support of the large number of his brewery workers.  He held the seat for nearly 20 years until his death at the age of 86, by which time he was the oldest member in the House of Commons.\nCharrington married Alethe Charlotte Pauline Calmeyer who was from Norway. One of their sons was killed in Egypt and another served in the Boer War. Charrington and his wife are commemorated on a memorial to their son in Holy Trinity Church, Barkingside.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1904", "response": ["** Spencer Charrington, English brewer and politician (born 1818)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Spencer Charrington"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Spencer Charrington"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Spencer Charrington"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Spencer Charrington"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Spencer Charrington"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|Spencer Charrington"]}, {"page": "William Evans-Gordon", "response": ["After his election Evans-Gordon became the brains and driving force behind the British Brothers' League (BBL) \u2013 an anti-alien pressure group formed in Stepney in May 1901 \u2013 although he took care to front the League with one William Stanley Shaw, an unimportant City clerk who was its first president.The BBL can be viewed as part of a wider effort of certain elements in the Conservative Party to build a base of popular support in the East End, thus driving a wedge between Liberal and labour.
