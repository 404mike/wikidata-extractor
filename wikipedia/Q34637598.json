United needed just one point to secure qualification, while their hosts were already eliminated following two defeats, but it was Chelsea who scored first through Josimar Quintero, shortly before half time. The young Chelsea team appeared to be on the verge of their first ever win in the tournament until Kane Hemmings scored an equaliser for Oxford in injury time at the end of the game. The game therefore went to penalties to decide which team would take two points from the game, and which team just one. With 34 penalties taken, 17 by each side, the shoot-out set the English football record for the most kicks, eclipsing the previous record of 32 which had occurred on two occasions. Chelsea were the eventual winners, by a score of 13\u201312, as the shoot-out concluded with a goal scored and then a goal saved by Blues keeper Bradley Collins. They, therefore, scored two points to Oxford's one, but the visitors nonetheless progressed through to the second round as runners-up to Swindon."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Forest Green Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 7 July 2017 || GK ||  || Bradley Collins || Chelsea || End of season || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["Luton extended their unbeaten league run to six matches after a 2\u20130 win away to Forest Green Rovers, in which Sheehan gave Luton the lead in first-half stoppage time with a drilled shot in off the post.

This was followed by a 5\u20130 home victory over Swindon Town, in which Luton took the lead three minutes into the second half through Collins with a curling shot into the top-left corner. Hylton doubled the lead seven minutes later with a header, his 15th goal of the season, before Matthew Taylor scored an own goal on 66 minutes from a Collins cross.
