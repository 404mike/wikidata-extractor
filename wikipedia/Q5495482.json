He enlisted as a gunner in the Royal Artillery, and three years later, in 1964, he was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps (later the Royal Corps of Transport). He volunteered for the Special Military Intelligence Unit in Northern Ireland in 1969, and he was trained at the Joint Services School of Intelligence. Once his training was finished, he was stationed in Portadown, where, for two and a half years up to 1975, he ran a series of intelligence operations. He resigned from the Army in 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dublin and Monaghan bombings", "response": ["Reference was made to the complexity of the attack and the sophistication of the bombs.

Barron noted that Wallace was targeted by the same security services he had served. He was forced to resign in 1975, ostensibly for trying to pass a classified document to journalist Robert Fisk. Wallace claims the real reasons for his dismissal were his refusal to continue working on the Clockwork Orange project, and his discovery that the security forces were involved in a child sex abuse ring. After his dismissal, Wallace attempted to expose these scandals, as well as state collusion with loyalists. In 1980, shortly after making some of his allegations, he was arrested and convicted of manslaughter. He was released on parole in 1985 and proclaimed his innocence. Various people have alleged that Wallace was framed. He later had his conviction overturned and was paid \u00a330,000 compensation for unjust dismissal from government service.

There also existed an MI6 honeypot for active paedophiles at Kincora boy's home during the 1970s. The Kincora home was used to blackmail and subvert prominent establishment figures in Northern Ireland via surveillance.

Thatcher denounced his claims as \"utterly contemptible\". In September 1987 Livingstone was elected to Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC), although he was voted off in October 1989, to be replaced by John Prescott. As Kinnock tried to pull Labour to the centre, Livingstone worked to strengthen its socialist elements. He refused to pay the controversial poll tax until it was revoked, and was one of the 55 Labour MPs to oppose British involvement in the Gulf War in January 1991. Conversely, he supported NATO intervention in the Balkans, and the bombing of Serbia."]}, {"page": "Nick Burbridge", "response": ["Burbridge has published the full-length novel Operation Emerald, under the pseudonym Dominic McCartan, concerning those caught up in the Troubles in Northern Ireland.Dominic McCartan, Operation Emerald, Pluto Press, London 1985/reprinted in the US by Red Dembner, 1986.   \"No escapist heroics here but a good few home truths.\" Tribune 27 September 1985. \"Among the most satisfying thrillers to emerge in the past year.\" Charles Shaar Murray, NME 16 November 1985.
