He came to prominence as the frontman of rock band the Smiths, who were active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his baritone voice and distinctive lyrics with recurring themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, self-deprecating and dark humour, and anti-establishment stances.\nBorn to working-class Irish immigrants in Davyhulme, Lancashire, Morrissey grew up in nearby Manchester. As a child, he developed a love of literature, kitchen sink realism, and 1960s pop music. In the late 1970s, he fronted punk rock band the Nosebleeds with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and writing several books on music and film in the early 1980s. He formed the Smiths with Johnny Marr in 1982 and the band soon attracted national recognition for their eponymous debut album. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark quiff and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the image of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced celibacy. The Smiths released three further studio albums\u2014Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead, and Strangeways, Here We Come\u2014and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987.\nIn 1988 Morrissey launched his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups\u2014Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I\u2014all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. He took on Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer as his main co-writers to replace Marr. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his albums Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, World Peace Is None of Your Business, Low in High School, California Son, and I Am Not a Dog on a Chain, as well as his autobiography and his debut novel, List of the Lost.\nHighly influential, Morrissey has been credited as a seminal figure in the emergence of indie rock and Britpop. In a 2006 poll for the BBC's Culture Show, Morrissey was voted the second-greatest living British cultural icon. His work has been the subject of academic study. He has been a controversial figure throughout his music career due to his forthright opinions and outspoken nature\u2014endorsing vegetarianism and animal rights, criticising royalty and prominent politicians, including support of some far-right activists with regard to freedom of speech and British heritage, defending a particular vision of national identity while critiquing the effect of immigration on the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Morrissey (born 1959, E)", "*Kim Morrissey (Janice Dales, living, C)"]}, {"page": "Ennio Morricone", "response": ["Morricone provided the string arrangements on Morrissey's \"Dear God Please Help Me\" from the album Ringleader of the Tormentors in 2006.Goddard, S.

Manchester was credited as the main driving force behind British indie music of the 1980s led by The Smiths, later including The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, and James. The later groups came from what became known as the \"Madchester\" scene that also centred on The Ha\u00e7ienda nightclub developed by the founder of Factory Records, Tony Wilson.

Morrissey and Johnny Marr shared an appreciation for the record, and one of their early compositions for the Smiths, \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", uses a melody based on that of \"Kimberly\". Courtney Love of Hole recounted that listening to Horses as a teenager helped encourage her to pursue a career in rock music, while PJ Harvey commented in 1992: \"I heard Horses once and it was brilliant\u2014not so much her music as her delivery, her words, her articulation.

Radio 2's Pete Mitchell talks to Howard Devoto, Siouxsie Sioux and Johnny Marr among others, as he shines a light on the life of this unsung guitar hero. Smiths' historian Goddard wrote that Marr \"praise[d] the McGeoch-era Banshees as a significant inspiration\". U2 cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as a major influence and selected \"Christine\" for a Mojo compilation. The Edge was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at the Mojo ceremony in 2005. In December 1981, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode named the Banshees as one of his three favourite bands along with Sparks and Roxy Music. Gahan later hailed the single \"Candyman\" at its release, saying, \"She always sounds exciting. She sings with a lot of sex - that's what I like. This is a great Banshees record[...], I like their sound. I used to see them quite a lot when I was younger.\" Commenting on the original Banshees line-up and they were different from other groups, Gahan said:  \"Siouxsie And The Banshees, whom I adored, sang much more abstract, artistic about frustration. Colder and darker\". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected \"Jigsaw Feeling\" from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited \"Hong Kong Garden\" in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, saying \"it was a completely new world\". Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine also mentioned them as being among his early influences. Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once noted a parallel between his band and the Banshees: \"There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees\". Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, \"They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We\u2019re not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we\u2019re coming from\".

Based on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on a guitar, bass and drum sound, and fusion of 1960s rock and post-punk, were a rejection of the synth-pop sound that was predominant at the time. Marr's Rickenbacker guitar work was reminiscent of the jangle pop sound of Roger McGuinn from the Byrds. Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes of ordinary lives with mordant humour.", "In May 1982, Johnny Marr and his friend Steve Pomfret went to the home of Steven Morrissey in Stretford to invite him to form a band. Marr and Morrissey had met at a Patti Smith gig at Manchester's Apollo Theatre on 31 August 1978, when Marr was 14 and Morrissey was 19. They bonded through their love of poetry and literature. A fan of the New York Dolls, Marr had been impressed that Morrissey had authored a book on the band and was inspired to turn up on his doorstep following the example of Jerry Leiber, who had formed his working partnership with Mike Stoller after turning up at the Stoller's door. According to Morrissey: \"We got on absolutely famously. We were very similar in drive.\" Conversing, the two found that they were fans of many of the same bands.

The next song that they worked on was \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", again was based on lyrics produced by Morrissey. Marr based the tempo on the Patti Smith song \"Kimberly\", and they recorded it on Marr's TEAC three-track cassette recorder. The third track that the duo worked on was \"Suffer Little Children\". Alongside these original compositions, Morrissey suggested that the band produce a cover of \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\", a song by the 1960s American girl band the Cookies; although he had never heard of the song before, Marr agreed, enjoying the subversive element of having a male vocalist sing it, and the song was recorded on his TEAC machine.", "By late 1982, Morrissey had chosen the band name the Smiths. He said later that \"it was the most ordinary name and I thought it was time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces\".

In 1983, he forbade those around him from using the name \"Steven\", which he despised.", "After remaining with the band for several rehearsals, Pomfret departed acrimoniously. He was replaced by the bass player Dale Hibbert, who worked at Manchester's Decibel Studios, where Marr had met him while recording Freak Party's demo. Through Hibbert, the Smiths recorded their first demo at Decibel one night in August 1982. Aided by drummer Simon Wolstencroft, whom Marr had worked with in Freak Party, the band recorded both \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" and \"Suffer Little Children\". Wolstencroft was not interested in joining the band, so following auditions Mike Joyce joined; he later revealed that he was under the influence of magic mushrooms during his audition.

Morrissey had organised the gig's aesthetic; the band came onstage to Klaus Nomi's version of Henry Purcell's \"The Cold Song\" playing through the venue's sound system before his friend James Maker stepped onstage to introduce the band. Maker remained onstage during the performance, relating that \"I was given a pair of maracas \u2013 an optional extra \u2013 and carte blanche. There were no instructions \u2013 I think it was generally accepted I would improvise... I was there to drink red wine, make extraneous hand gestures and keep well within the tight, chalked circle that Morrissey had drawn around me.\" Hibbert was allegedly unhappy with what he perceived as the band's \"gay\" aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, so he was replaced by Marr's old schoolfriend Andy Rourke. Hibbert denies that he objected to the band being perceived as gay, and said he was not sure why he was asked to leave.", "Morrissey and Marr visited London to hand a cassette of their recordings to Geoff Travis of the independent record label Rough Trade Records.

Travis brought in Troy Tate of the Teardrop Explodes, and under his supervision the band recorded their first album, at the Elephant Studios in Wapping, East London. Rough Trade were unhappy with the album and Tate's production, insisting the band rerecord it with a new producer, John Porter. The singles \"This Charming Man\" and \"What Difference Does It Make?\" reached numbers 25 and 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

The band had also grown more diverse musically, with Marr adding rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funk bass solo on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The album was preceded by the re-release of the B-side \"How Soon Is Now?\" as a single, and although that song was not on the original LP, it has been added to subsequent releases.

Among his targets were the Thatcher government, the British monarchy and the famine relief project Band Aid. Morrissey famously quipped of the last, \"One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia, but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England\" (\"torture\" being a reference to the music that resulted from the project). The subsequent single-only release \"Shakespeare's Sister\" reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart, although the only single taken from the album, \"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\", was less successful, barely making the top 50.

While the shows were successful, heavy drinking and drug use by crew and band members other than Morrissey took a toll on the group, along with ineffective management and lingering disputes with Rough Trade, whom the band was seriously considering leaving for EMI, and Sire Records, their American label, who Morrissey felt did not do enough to promote the Smiths. After a date in St. Petersburg, Florida, he and Marr cancelled the remaining four shows, including a grand finale at New York City's Radio City Music Hall. After the following UK tour ended in October 1986, Gannon left the band, having played on six studio tracks.

This was followed by the single \"Sheila Take a Bow\", the band's second (and last during the band's lifetime) UK top-10 hit. Another compilation, Louder Than Bombs, was intended for the overseas market and covered much the same material as The World Won't Listen, with the addition of \"Sheila Take a Bow\" and material from Hatful of Hollow, which was yet to be released in the US.

Marr was exhausted and took a break from the band in June 1987, which he felt was negatively perceived by his bandmates. In July, he left the group because he erroneously believed an NME article entitled \"Smiths to Split\" was planted by Morrissey.Johnny Rogan, Morrissey and Marr: The Severed Alliance (London: Omnibus, 1992), pp.\u00a0281\u2013282.
