He was educated at Bolton School before going up to Merton College, Oxford to read History in 1956. He worked as an Anglican parish priest and a research fellow at the University of Sussex before becoming a full-time freelance author and journalist in 1982.  In 1961 he married Audrey Winifred Darlington; they had two daughters.He lived for many years in the Dordogne region of France, on which he became an expert, writing a guidebook and gazeteer which contained scholarly essays on the troubadours of the region, its prehistoric cave art and its cuisine. His separate book on the food of the region remains an excellent guide and the recipes he proposes are reliable.\nBentley died in hospital in Saumur, France in December 2000 after suffering extensive injuries in a collision near his home.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albert Schweitzer", "response": ["Schweitzer is often cited in vegetarian literature as being an advocate of vegetarianism in his later years.Barkas, Janet L. (1975). The Vegetable Passion. Scribner. p. 131. Gregerson, Jon. (1994). Vegetarianism: A History. Jain Publishing Company. p. 104.  Schweitzer was not a vegetarian in his earlier life. For example, in 1950, biographer Magnus C. Ratter commented that Schweitzer never \"commit[ted] himself to the anti- vivisection, vegetarian, or pacifist positions, though his thought leads in this direction\".Ratter, Magnus C. (1950). Albert Schweitzer: Life and Message. Beacon Press. p. 179 Biographer James Bentley has written that Schweitzer became a vegetarian after his wife's death in 1957 and he was \"living almost entirely on lentil soup\".Brentley, James. (1992). Albert Schweitzer: The Enigma. HarperCollins. p. 200.  In contrast to this, historian David N. Stamos has written that Schweitzer was not a vegetarian in his personal life nor imposed it on his missionary hospital but he did help animals and was opposed to hunting.Stamos, David N. (2008). Evolution and the Big Questions: Sex, Race, Religion, and Other Matters. Wiley. p. 175.  Stamos noted that Schweitzer held the view that evolution ingrained humans with an instinct for meat so it was useless in trying to deny it."]}, {"page": "James Bentley", "response": ["James Bentley may refer to:", "* James Bentley (Eureka Rebellion), Australian hotelier and owner of Bentley's Hotel, and prime suspect of the murder of James Scobie, which led to the Eureka Rebellion", "* James Bentley (author) (1937\u20132000), English author", "* James Bentley (actor) (born 1992), English actor", "* James Bentley (rugby league) (born 1996), English rugby league player"]}]}}
