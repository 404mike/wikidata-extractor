He supported James Abbott McNeill Whistler (they had married sisters). He also recommended T. S. Eliot to Geoffrey Faber, which resulted in Eliot's being appointed as an editor at Faber and Gwyer. Eliot's essay Charles Whibley (1931) was contained within his Selected Essays, 1917-1932.

He kept the relationship hidden and exchanged letters with her, most of which he later mostly destroyed. After two years she died of tuberculosis. He was devastated and confided in many of his friends. He dedicated Le livre de Monelle to her, basing the central character on Louise, but turning her into a child of indeterminate age. Many consider this his most personal work, and it is the single book for which he became best known during his lifetime. The year after Louise's death, 1894, Schwob met Marguerite Moreno, who, at 23, had been named by St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 \"the sacred muse of Symbolism\", and was the lover of Catulle Mend\u00e8s.
