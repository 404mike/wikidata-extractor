Whibley's style was described by Matthew as \"often acerbic high Tory commentary\". In literature and the arts, his views were progressive. He supported James Abbott McNeill Whistler (they had married sisters). He also recommended T. S. Eliot to Geoffrey Faber, which resulted in Eliot's being appointed as an editor at Faber and Gwyer. Eliot's essay Charles Whibley (1931) was contained within his Selected Essays, 1917-1932. Whibley died on 4 March 1930 at Hy\u00e8res, France, and his body was buried at Great Brickhill, Buckinghamshire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
