After Hinckley United manager Dean Thomas resigned on 10 October 2012 following an early F.A Cup exit and a poor start to the Conference North league campaign, Heggs was put in caretaker charge of the football club alongside Neil Lyne. He also \"threw his hat into the ring for the manager's position on a permanent basis\", according to a club statement. On Thursday, 15 November, Heggs was offered the manager's job on a permanent basis until the end of the 2012\u20132013 season. Heggs later accepted the offer. Heggs came out of retirement on 19 November for a game against Bradford PA with Hinckley United desperate for players."]}, {"page": "Tony Loughlan", "response": ["In August 1989, Loughlan and teammate Neil Lyne were signed by Nottingham Forest; the transfer would later be highlighted in the 1997 Premier League report of Rick Parry, Robert Reid QC and Steve Coppell on bung culture in football.
