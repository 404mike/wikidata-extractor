It featured the ten original Bears, along with six additions to the line-up, and marked the media debut of the Care Bear Cousins. Produced for at least US$2 million, the film was financed by American Greetings, the owners of the Care Bears franchise; General Mills, the toys' distributor; and television syndicator LBS Communications.  The Kenner company also took part in the production.  Brought in under budget, The Care Bears Movie became Nelvana's second feature-length production, and was made over an eight-month period that lasted until February 1985.  Michael Hirsh is quoted as saying in Daniel Stoffman's 2002 book, The Nelvana Story: \"Nobody had ever made an animated movie for theatrical release for as little money and in as little time.\" In 2009 his partner, Clive A. Smith, told Canadian Business magazine: \"I swear I grimaced at the thought of doing a Care Bears feature. But Michael [Hirsh] went out and actually brought that project in.\"  Nelvana was responsible for the script, several special effects, including those for the \"Care Bear Stare\", and hired musicians and voice actors.  With this project, Arna Selznick became the third of only four women ever to direct an animated feature; prior to this, she worked on several Nelvana productions, including Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name.  Nelvana's founders\u2014Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert, and Clive A. Smith\u2014participated as the main producers. The studio's roster included Charles Bonifacio, the director of animation, and supervising animator D. Brewster, who previously took part in the animation courses at Ontario's Sheridan College.  Dale Schott, who served as a storyboard artist, remarked that \"Nelvana had a lot to do with reviving the low-budget feature\" with its efforts on The Care Bears Movie.", "The Care Bears Movie premiered in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 1985, as part of a Special Olympics benefit; Georgia Engel, the voice of Love-a-lot Bear, attended this event. The film opened on March 29, 1985, in the United States and Canada, as Nelvana's first widely released feature. It became surprisingly successful at the North American box office, playing primarily at matinees and early evening showings. At the time, the North American film industry was bereft of children's and family fare; with The Care Bears Movie, Hirsh said, \"There's such a large audience for a film that appeals primarily to 6-year-olds.\" He remarked later on, \"What we've done [at Nelvana] is tailor the film to a pre-literate audience, the very young. It's interesting to see the audience. The kids are fixated on the screen. [It's] awesome to them.\" Clive A. Smith observed that some children came to showings with their Bears;  long line-ups held back its audience in several cities. Among those attending the matinee screenings was John Waters, a filmmaker known for Pink Flamingos and Polyester.  The film made an appearance at the USA Film Festival in Dallas, Texas, during its release."]}, {"page": "Clive", "response": ["* Clive A.
