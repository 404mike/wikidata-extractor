In it, Webster argues that Freud became a kind of Messiah and that psychoanalysis is a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. The work received acclaim. It was called \"brilliant\" by Anthony Storr and Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy. Gathorne-Hardy comments that he is \"indebted\" to Webster's \"fascinating and brilliant\" book. It was identified as \"an indispensable modern critique of psychoanalysis\" by Storr and \"the most comprehensive negative critique\" of Freud by professor of German language and literature Ritchie Robertson (who notes that it incorporates earlier critiques). Webster has been credited with exposing the weakness of Freud's science and exposing his disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition more comprehensively than any previous author."]}, {"page": "Rich Robertson", "response": ["*Ritchie Robertson (born 1952), professor of German"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages, University of Oxford", "response": ["There are two chairs associated with German studies.

Crews maintained that Masson had failed to learn from critiques of the book, and that its arguments depended on fallacies. In The New York Review of Books, Crews called the book a melodramatic work in which Masson misrepresented \"Freud's 'seduction' patients as self-aware incest victims rather than as the doubters that they remained\". Other authors who have discussed the book include the literary scholar Ritchie Robertson, the psychologist Louis Breger, and the scholar John Kerr. Robertson wrote that Masson overstated the case against Freud, observing that while Freud may have underestimated the frequency of child abuse, he did not deny that it does often occur. Breger wrote that Masson provided valuable information on the later life of Eckstein and was correct to question the accepted account of the abandonment of the seduction theory. However, he found Masson's speculations about why Freud abandoned the theory unconvincing. Kerr described the book as flawed but useful in bringing psychoanalytic attention to childhood sexual abuse."]}, {"page": "The Memory Wars", "response": ["Webster described The Memory Wars as one of the most trenchant and significant contributions to the debate on recovered-memory therapy. The psychologist Jennifer Freyd wrote that Crews made incorrect claims about Cheit's case and that Cheit himself had objected to Crews's account of how he remembered being sexually abused as a child. She also argued that Crews's understanding of repression was confused and that he was mistaken to claim that Cheit's case was irrelevant to the repressed memory debate. The philosopher John Forrester described Crews's article \"The Unknown Freud\" as a celebrated and widely-read article. He criticized Crews for discussing Gr\u00fcnbaum's criticisms of psychoanalysis in The Foundations of Psychoanalysis as though they were \"already proven and widely accepted\" and for presenting a \"deeply personal\" attack on Freud as though it were scholarly criticism. He noted that while Crews made criticisms of psychoanalysis similar to those already made by Gr\u00fcnbaum, he took them to extremes. He also accused Crews of having a \"bizarre view\" of \"how scientists operate\". The literature scholar Ritchie Robertson described The Memory Wars as representing \"the more polemical version of anti-Freudian criticism\". The psychologist Michael Billig described Crews as one of the most notable critics of Freud to have suggested that the memories reported by Freud's patients were suggested by Freud himself. He criticized Crews's view that repression must be understood as a completely unconscious process."]}, {"page": "Schwarz-Taylor Professor of the German Language and Literature", "response": ["* Ritchie Robertson 2010\u20132021 "]}]}}
