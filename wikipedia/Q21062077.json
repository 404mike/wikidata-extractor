Just two players had been signed, forwards Jack Curtis and Stephen Stonley. As the season got underway, Brentford lost just two of the first 10 Southern League Second Division matches, but by that point it had become obvious that the war would not be over by Christmas as predicted. Beginning in mid-October 1914, the squad was decimated by departures to serve in the army (Kent, Sloley, Hendren, Amos), work in munitions at the Royal Arsenal (McGovern, Johnson, Stonley) or on transfers (J. Curtis, Spratt). Reserves, guest players, free transfers and local amateurs were brought in to plug gaps in the squad, with full back Fred Price, half backs Mick O'Brien, Charles Allwright and forwards Michael Donaghy, Walter Chalk, F. Arnold and Charles Hibbert making up for the departures of the professionals in the second half of the season. Amateur Walter Chalk would become something of a minor success, scoring six goals in 9 appearances.", "|Stephen Stonley", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Stephen Stonley", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Stephen Stonley", "| Stephen Stonley"]}, {"page": "Stonley, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen Stonley"]}]}}
