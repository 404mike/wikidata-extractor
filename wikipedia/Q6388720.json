A striker, he spent six years in the Football League. His father, also called Ken Wookey, was also a professional footballer.\nHe started his career with local club Newport County in 1964. After five years with County, he was loaned out to Lovell's Athletic, before signing permanently with Port Vale in 1969. After helping the \"Valiants\" to promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1969\u201370, he transferred to Workington. In 1971, he dropped into non-league football when he joined Yeovil Town. He later played for Salisbury City, Barry Town, Westland Sports, Chard Town, Glastonbury Town, and Sturminster Newton United. He later managed Sturminster Newton and Shaftesbury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["In preparation for the 1969\u201370 campaign he released Mick Cullerton, Mick Mahon, Jimmy Goodfellow, Graham Williams, and Milija Aleksic; whilst top-scorer Roy Chapman rejected a new contract and signed with Chester City. Despite this, the club's dire finances meant that he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic). Vale started the season with a club-record unbeaten 18 matches, and Lee began playing midfielder Tommy McLaren on a regular basis. Vale's financial situation was highlighted by the fact that they could not afford the \u00a3500 registration fee for Ian Buxton following the player's departure from Notts County. The \"Valiants\" were knocked off the top of the table following a bout of injuries, and Lee was forced to sign wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston. Speaking of their third-place finish, Lee said that \"no team could have deserved reward as much for their hard work and strength of character\".", "Preparing for life in the Third Division, Lee released Ken Wookey, Stuart Shaw, Eric Magee, Stuart Chapman, and Gordon Logan. In their place he signed centre-half Roy Cross from Walsall, inside-forward Brian Horton from Hednesford Town, and full-back Mick Hopkinson from Mansfield Town. He steadied the ship in the midst of infighting in the boardroom, and the team went on a four-game winning streak in October that included a 2\u20130 win over fallen-giants Aston Villa. In January, he signed John Brodie from Northern Premier League side Bradford Park Avenue for \u00a3250, and noted that his team's performances were not helped by the 'boo boys' at Vale Park. Safety was assured with a 17th place, three points above relegated Reading."]}, {"page": "Kenneth George Wookey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ken Wookey (footballer, born 1946)"]}, {"page": "Ken Wookey", "response": ["Ken Wookey may refer to:", "*Ken Wookey (footballer, born 1922), Welsh professional footballer", "*Ken Wookey (footballer, born 1946), Welsh professional footballer, his son"]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["In the pre-season there were talks of bringing speedway to Vale Park, introducing a new team to the British League Division Two.
