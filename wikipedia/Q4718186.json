To reduce magnetic interference with the navigational instruments, FitzRoy proposed replacing the iron guns with brass guns, but the Admiralty turned this request down. (When the ship reached Rio de Janeiro in April 1832, he used his own funds for replacements: the ship now had a \"six-pound boat-carronade\" on a turntable on the forecastle, two brass six-pound guns before the main-mast, and aft of it another four brass guns; two of these were nine-pound, and the other two six-pound.)", "* The sympiesometer of Alexander Adie"]}, {"page": "Thomas Henderson (astronomer)", "response": ["He married Alexander Adie's daughter Janet Mary Adie (1808\u20131842) in 1836 and had one daughter, Janet Mary Jane Henderson (1842\u20131893).", "He died at home 1 Hillside Crescent in Edinburgh on 23 November 1844 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard.
