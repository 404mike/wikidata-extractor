The club said goodbye to long serving custodian Bob Connelly and former England international and Villa legend Richard York. Manager Tom Morgan was also replaced, with former manager Tom Holford reinstated. However the club again narrowly avoided relegation and had little cause for celebration, though a profit was made financially. Once more the club had a clear out. Under-performers were let go, as was Kirkham, who chose to pursue a career in education rather than football. The club had a strong 1933\u201334 on the pitch, finishing in eight place. Billy Tabram held strong at the back while Tom Nolan was scoring consistently. However the season was a financial disaster. As a result, fifteen players were let go, including Bill Cope, Jimmy McGrath and Len Armitage, Tabram was sold to Hull City for a good profit, as was Fred Mills and George Poyser to Leeds United and Brentford respectively. The 1934\u201335 season was largely forgettable on the pitch, apart from a close FA Cup game with eventual runners-up West Bromwich Albion. However, in the middle of the season there were calls for a change of name; supporters were barely in favour, with names such as 'Stoke Central' and 'Stoke United' suggested. A meeting of shareholders discussed the name of 'Stoke North End', though the eventually settled on 'Hanley Port Vale'. This new name was not favoured by the fans and talk of a name change lingered for a few years before eventually falling away."]}, {"page": "List of footballers killed during World War II", "response": ["* Fred Mills \u2013 played for Port Vale and Leeds United.
