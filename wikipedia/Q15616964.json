He was a member of the Irish Volunteers. His brother Major John MacBride fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and was executed by the British authorities. Joseph was arrested after the Rising and interned in prison in England and Wales.\nHe was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in MP for the Mayo West constituency at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, though MacBride did not attend as he was in prison.He was re-elected unopposed at the 1921 elections for the Mayo North and West constituency. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted for it. He was again re-elected unopposed at the 1922 general election as a member of Pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in. He joined Cumann na nGaedheal along with other pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TDs in 1923, and was elected at the 1923 general election for Mayo South. He lost his seat at the June 1927 general election and retired from politics.His nephew Se\u00e1n MacBride was subsequently Chief of Staff of the IRA and a founder of Clann na Poblachta and a government minister.", "link_mentions": {}}}
