He was also known as Bob Symes, and sometimes credited-as Robert Symes-Shutzmann or Bob Symes-Shutzmann.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tomorrow's World", "response": ["The idiosyncratic Bob Symes showcased smaller inventions in dramatised vignettes with themes such as Bob Goes Golfing. These often presented challenges for film directors with whom he worked when a close-up was required as Symes's own invention-related exploits in the workshop had resulted in him losing parts of several fingers. It was hard to find a finger that did not look too gruesome to show on screen. Other regular features included Whatever Happened to..., picking up on the oft-levelled criticism of the show that a significant number of inventions seemingly were never heard of again."]}, {"page": "Waverley Route", "response": ["An attempt to reopen part of the line by the Border Union Railway Company (BUR), a private concern in which Tomorrow's World presenter Bob Symes was involved, failed due to lack of finance. British Rail had been asking for between \u00a3745,000 and \u00a3960,000 for the freehold of the line, \u00a3125,000 annually for running powers into Edinburgh and Carlisle, \u00a385,000 for works in Carlisle, \u00a310,000 towards their administrative costs and \u00a3495,000 for the value of the permanent way materials. A deposit of \u00a3250,000 had to be paid by 1 December 1969. Although the British Rail Board was interested and generally supportive, the Scottish Region was uninterested, unhelpful and obstructive. Access for BUR officers to the line was made difficult and Scottish Region staff were dismantling equipment even as negotiations progressed. An amount of \u00a375,000 per year was demanded to connect with the main line at Portobello. A lower price was asked of the section between Riddings and Carlisle - \u00a3100,000 for the track and \u00a368,000 for the land - but the sale would come with the obligation to ensure that  of fencing be kept sheep-proof. The BUR decided that the Melrose to Edinburgh section offered scope for regular commuter traffic and chose Melrose as its headquarters. Things began to go wrong in 1970 when a number of potential backers pulled out and the 1970 general election saw the appointment of a new Minister of Transport, John Peyton, who was unable or unwilling to understand the BUR's plans. British Rail subsequently demanded a retainer rent on the land whilst the discussions continued, but the BUR declined on the basis that it would be cheaper to buy the land later and relay rather than pay the purchase price plus rent. British Rail thus began track-lifting and selling parcels of land, including much of the Galashiels site which went for housing. The BUR sought to obtain a more accommodating approach from the Minister but he refused. At the end of 1970, the BUR reluctantly abandoned the project and was wound up."]}, {"page": "Symes", "response": ["* Bob Symes, the stage name of inventor Robert Alexander Baron Schutzmann von Schutzmansdorff"]}, {"page": "List of railfans", "response": ["* Bob Symes, British television presenter and producer."]}, {"page": "List of rail transport modellers", "response": ["| Bob Symes || British television presenter and producer ||   ||   ||"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Bob Symes, 90, inventor and television presenter."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2015", "response": ["*Bob Symes, 90, British inventor and television presenter.RIP Bob Symes 1924 \u2013 2015"]}, {"page": "2015 deaths in British television", "response": ["|Bob Symes"]}]}}
