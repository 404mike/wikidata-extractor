Dodds was a Cambridge graduate, previously a housemaster at St Peter's York, a justice of the peace, Samaritan and founder of the Boarding Schools Association. He successfully saw the school, of just 250 students, through a rapidly changing educational climate. But, at that size, which gave it a lower student to teacher ratio than the most exclusive public schools, the Conservative Party (UK) politicians who ran Surrey county council, did not think it represented value for money. After Ottershaw School closed, Dodds first became a Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) civil servant, before being appointed personal assistant to the Bishop of Southwark, the Right Reverend Ronald Bowlby. Dodds died in March 2016. His son Richard Dodds OBE, who grew up at the school, is a former English field hockey player and was captain of the gold medal-winning Great Britain squad in the 1988 Summer Seoul Olympics. He is currently a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in Berkshire, UK."]}, {"page": "1986 Men's Hockey World Cup", "response": ["The first semi-final, between England and West Germany, was an absolute classic. A replay of the semi-final of the 1984 Olympic tournament, won 1-0 by the Germans, meant that the English had a score to settle.  England dominated most of the first half, but in the end had only one goal to show for it, scored by star centre-forward Sean Kerly. In the second half, the Germans found their form, equalising from a penalty corner, and then going into the lead with a smart strike from their captain, Heiner Dopp.  The remainder of the match was end-to-end stuff as England pressed hard for an equaliser.  Several times they came close from both open play and penalty corners: shots whizzed past the post, crosses were desperately intercepted, the keeper himself made a few useful saves \u2013 but the Germans were themselves dangerous on the breakaway. Fischer thought he had scored a German third from a penalty corner, but it was disallowed as the ball flew dangerously high off his stick: Dopp, too, nearly scored another, but was denied by a last-ditch deflection from England's own captain, Richard Dodds.  Finally, in the last minute, with England on the verge of going out, they were awarded a penalty corner, from which Paul Barber scored an equalizer \u2013 almost blocked by a German stick, but it deflected into the roof of the net, forcing extra time. The extra period was as thrilling as the last minutes of the main game, both sides going for all-out attack: the game was finally settled by another English penalty corner, from which Barber scored an action-replay of his earlier goal to send England into the final.", "Ian Taylor, David Faulkner, Paul Barber, Jon Potter, Richard Dodds (capt), Martyn Grimley, Stephen Batchelor (sub Kulbir Bhaura), Richard Leman (sub John Shaw), Sean Kerly, Norman Hughes, Imran Sherwani"]}]}}
