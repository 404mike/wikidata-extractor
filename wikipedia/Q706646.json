These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky, and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year. In 1799 Beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano 'duel' at the home of Baron Raimund Wetzlar (a former patron of Mozart) against the virtuoso Joseph W\u00f6lfl; and in the following year he similarly triumphed against Daniel Steibelt at the salon of Count Moritz von Fries. Beethoven's eighth piano sonata the Path\u00e9tique (Op. 13), published in 1799 is described by the musicologist Barry Cooper as \"surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation\"."]}, {"page": "Diabelli Variations", "response": ["Powerful, rhythmic chords, forte, each time followed by nearly two bars of silence, then a soft reply. \"Eloquent pauses\", in von Lenz's words. \"Absurd silences\", for Gerald Abraham.Abraham, Gerald, The Age of Beethoven, 1790\u20131830, Oxford University Press, , , 1982, p. 352. Barry Cooper sees it as a humorous piece, in which Beethoven \"seems almost to poke fun at Diabelli's theme\". Diabelli's mild opening turn is turned into the powerful chords, and his repeated chords become a long silence. The sequence is ended with two soft, anti-climactic notes. Brendel's title for this variation is Aphorism (biting).", "One of the last variations composed, Variation 15 is short and light, setting the stage for the following two loud virtuoso displays. For Barry Cooper, this is another humorous variation poking fun at Diabelli's theme.

There are a few extra bars in the transitional section into the B section; and finally, the rising A minor arpeggio figure is moved later into the piece.
