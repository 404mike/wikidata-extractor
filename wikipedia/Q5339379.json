The Alphonsine tables saw its name split into \"Rigel\" and \"Algebar\", with the note, et dicitur Algebar. Nominatur etiam Rigel.

That short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his emendation and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of Hody, Mill or Edmund Chilmead.
