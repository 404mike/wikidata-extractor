Dean Ashton headed Norwich ahead from David Bentley's free-kick and crossed for Leon McKenzie to volley home. Craig Fleming and Jason Shackell were outstanding in a Canaries defence that thwarted United's subdued strikeforce.

However, despite this and an opening day defeat, the club enjoyed a relatively good start to the season, with three consecutive home wins in the league and progress in the League Cup.
