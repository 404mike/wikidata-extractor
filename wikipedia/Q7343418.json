The title came from photographer Robert Davidson, who had received a letter from an unknown individual that read \"I listen to pop music on the radio because where I live it's so bloody quiet that I can hear the grass grow.\" He told this to Wood, who was inspired enough to write a song regarding the subject. In the April 1967 Beat Instrumental issue, Wood states that the song is about a mentally ill person. Although journalists have presumed the song to be about the synesthetic effects of hallucinogenics, Wood has on multiple occasions refuted that claim, accusing the music press of trying to build an association between pop musicians and drugs, and noting that virtually any song could be misinterpreted as being about drug use by someone looking to make that connection. The group entered Advision Studios in London on 5 January 1967 to record the song, along with what eventually would become the B-side, \"Wave the Flag and Stop the Train\", with producer Denny Cordell."]}, {"page": "Robert davidson (photographer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Davidson (photographer)"]}]}}
