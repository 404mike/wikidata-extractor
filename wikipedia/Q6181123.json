He was the only son of tea-taster Dudley A. Black and his wife Joan M. n\u00e9e Denton (1913-1957). At age two, he was isolated for a whole year in hospital with polio, then, at age five, he suffered the death of his mother.\nAfter his attendance at Slough Grammar School for Boys, in 1969 Black went to Worcester College, Oxford, as Exhibitioner in Classics. At Oxford, he became interested in the ancient languages and cultures of Mesopotamia, and, after qualifying, changed his studies to Sumerian and Akkadian under Professor Oliver Gurney. His (still unpublished) BA dissertation was entitled \"A History of Nippur, from the Earliest Times to the End of the Kassite Period\u201d: this work was utilised in the very beginning of S.W. Cole's book Nippur in Late Assyrian Times, ca. 745-612 B.C., 1996, where it is described as the \"only systematic treatment of Nippur's early history\". In 1975 Black attained his BPhil in Cuneiform Studies.\nFor postgraduate studies, partly supervised by Edmond Sollberger of the British Museum, and with the continuing guidance of Gurney at Oxford, Black wrote his DPhil dissertation on \"Ancient Babylonian Grammatical Theory\", submitted in 1980 and later published under the title Sumerian Grammar in Babylonian Theory, Rome 1984, 2nd edition 1991. A.R. George has described it as \"the only book-length examination of the linguistic thinking that underpinned the Babylonians' understanding of Sumerian\".\nWhile completing his DPhil dissertation, Black took a position with St Catherine's Foundation, Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park. In 1981, however, he was enabled to return full-time to the field of Assyriology by his appointment to a Research Associate post at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago to work on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary Project (see acknowledgement of his contribution on the title pages of volumes 17/\u0160 [1989\u20131992] and 14/R [1999]).\nIn 1982 Black took up the post of Assistant Director of the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq, the Baghdad wing of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq, succeeding Michael Roaf, who had been elevated to the directorship. Following the resignation of Roaf in late 1985, Black was appointed Director, which post he held until early 1988.\nIn Iraq Black served as epigrapher on a number of archaeological expeditions, and in Baghdad carried out research in the Iraq Museum, where he worked especially on the tablets (cuneiform documents) discovered in the earlier major British excavations at Ur and Nimrud; the latter were published in J.A. Black and D. J. Wiseman, Cuneiform Tablets from Nimrud, 4: Literary Texts from the Temple of Nab\u00fb, London 1996. Black also collaborated on Assyriological works with Iraqi scholars, notably with Farouk Al-Rawi, and with other colleagues from the days in Baghdad: the book Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary (co-authored with Anthony Green, illustrated by Tessa Rickards, London and Austin 1992, 2nd edition 1998) grew out of such an association. Also in Iraq, Black met and married the British archaeologist Ellen McAdam (later divorced).\nBenefitting from the recommendations of the 1986 Parker Report into Asian and African Studies in Universities in the UK, in 1988 Oxford University was able to re-establish a full-time lectureship in Assyriology (absent since the retirement of Gurney in 1978). The new post, known as University Lecturer in Akkadian, was awarded to Black, who was also elected a Fellow of Wolfson College.\nBack in Oxford \u2013 apart from periods devoted to full administrative duties, first as Senior Proctor of the University, 1995\u20131996, then as chairman of the board of the Faculty of Oriental Studies, 1999\u20132001 \u2013 Black was free to develop his studies in Sumerian literature, literary criticism and philology. Most notable was the publication of his Reading Sumerian Poetry, Oxford 1988. In the assessment of A.R. George, this book \"displays ... a real sensitivity to Sumerian imagery\u201d. Black also collaborated with Andrew R. George and J. Nicholas Postgate on A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian, 1999 (reprinted 2000). He actively participated in other scholarly projects, such as those of the international \u201cSumerian Grammar Group\u201d and the Gr\u00f6ningen-based \u201cMesopotamian Literature Group\u201d.\nFrom 1997, with initial funding from the Leverhulme Trust, and later from the Arts and Humanities Research Board, Black founded and administered what may well come to be considered his greatest legacy, the Internet-based \"Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature\". Work by the project team continued after Black's death, although active funding was ended in mid-2006.\nTowards the end of his life Black had the pleasurable discovery of, and contact with, his half-brother, Peter Mitchell (the son of Dudley by his first wife), living in the British Virgin Islands. He was also an enthusiastic amateur musician who sang bass with the Cathedral Singers of Christ Church, Oxford, and with the Northamptonshire-based period music ensemble Fiori Musicali.\nBlack died in 2004 at Oxford. The Jeremy Allen Black Trust for Assyriology, a fund to support young Assyriologists, was established by the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Oxford University in his memory. At Upton Court Grammar School, a memorial prize for Languages and Classics is given each year in his memory.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ninurta", "response": ["Ninurta was worshipped in Mesopotamia as early as the middle of the third millennium BC by the ancient Sumerians, and is one of the earliest attested deities in the region. His main cult center was the Eshumesha temple in the Sumerian city-state of Nippur, where he was worshipped as the god of agriculture and the son of the chief-god Enlil. Though they may have originally been separate deities, in historical times, the god Nin\u011dirsu, who was worshipped in the Sumerian city-state of Girsu, was always identified as a local form of Ninurta. According to the Assyriologists Jeremy Black and Anthony Green, the two gods' personalities are \"closely intertwined\". King Gudea of Lagash (ruled 2144\u20132124 BC) dedicated himself to Nin\u011dirsu and the Gudea cylinders, dating to  2125 BC, record how he rebuilt the temple of Nin\u011dirsu in Lagash as the result of a dream in which he was instructed to do so. The Gudea cylinders record the longest surviving account written in the Sumerian language known to date. Gudea's son Ur-Nin\u011dirsu incorporated Nin\u011dirsu's name as part of his own in order to honor him. As the city-state of Girsu declined in importance, Nin\u011dirsu became increasingly known as \"Ninurta\". Though Ninurta was originally worshipped solely as a god of agriculture, in later times, as Mesopotamia became more urban and militarized, he began to be increasingly seen as a warrior deity instead. He became primarily characterized by the aggressive, warlike aspect of his nature. In spite of this, however, he continued to be seen as a healer and protector, and he was commonly invoked in spells to protect against demons, disease, and other dangers."]}, {"page": "Enheduanna", "response": ["The question of Enheduanna's authorship of poems has been subject to significant debate. While Hallo and \u00c5ke Sjoberg were the first to definitively assert Enheduanna's authorship of the works attributed to her, other Assyriologists including Miguel Civil and  Jeremy Black have put forth arguments rejecting or doubting Enheduanna's authorship.  Civil has raised the possibility that \"Enheduanna\" refers not to the name, but instead the station of EN priestess that the daughter of Sargon of Akkad held. This would imply that the poems were not all written by the same \"Enheduanna\" but that they were each narrated as if spoken by the high priestess. Black stresses that \"whether this claim itself dates back to the Agade Period is, of course, a quite separate question\" noting that the same phrasing that attributes the authorship of Hymn 42 to Enheduanna is used in the late Babylonian poem Erra and Ishum to attribute that work to the god Erra. For the Inanna and Nanna poems, Black et al. argue that at best, all of the manuscript sources date from at least six centuries after when she would have lived, and they were found in scribal settings, not ritual ones, and that \"surviving sources show no traces of Old Sumerian... making it impossible to posit what that putative original might have looked like.\" "]}, {"page": "Upton Court Grammar School", "response": ["*Dr Jeremy Black (1951\u20132004) \u2013 assyriologist"]}, {"page": "Nisaba", "response": ["Nisaba's name was originally written using a combination of the cuneiform sign , called NAGA, and the dingir, , representing divinity.

Dumuzid was also listed as an early king of Uruk, where he was said to have come from the nearby village of Kuara and to have been the consort of the goddess Inanna. As Dumuzid sipad (\"Dumuzid the Shepherd\"), Dumuzid was believed to be the provider of milk, which was a rare, seasonal commodity in ancient Sumer due to the fact that it could not easily be stored without spoiling."]}, {"page": "Barton Cylinder", "response": ["The most recent edition was published by Bendt Alster and Aage Westenholz in 1994.Bendt Alster and Aage Westenholz, \"The Barton Cylinder,\" Acta Sumeriologica 16 (1994) 15-46.

He proposed that the tigi was probably a hymn accompanied by lyre, that irshemma was perhaps one accompanied by a type of drum and that adab possibly a hymn accompanied by another form of string instrument.", "Stephen Langdon suggested the hymn gave evidence of the Sumerian theological view that Enlil and Ninlil created mankind and living things. He noted that Nintud, the primary goddess of Kesh was \"a form of Ninlil in Nippur : in other words she is Ninlil of Kesh, where her character as goddess of begetting was emphasized.\" He noted based on an observation of Theophilus G. Pinches, that Ninlil or Belit Ilani had seven different names (such as Nintud, Ninhursag, Ninmah, etc.) for seven different localities. He also discussed the location of Kesh appearing to be near Kish to the east of Babylon calling the temple of Kesh \"Ekisigga\". Raymond de Hoop noted similarities between Sumerian temple hymns and chapter forty nine of Genesis in the Bible (). He suggests remarkably close syntactical and metaphorical parallels in the sayings about Joseph and Judah such as \"the highly esteemed prince (), \"a leopard, who seizes prey\" (), \"a great wild ox / a wild bull\" () and \" seed of a (the) steer, engendered by a wild ox (). Jeremy Black noted that Kesh was no longer a major settlement by the time of the later Babylonian versions but presumed that the temple of Nintud still functioned. Wilfred G. Lambert noted that many kings had built temples and chapels to Ninhursag, but that the Kesh sanctuary \"was the centre of the goddess's cult from the Early Dynastic period into the Old Babylonian Dynasty; after this time it lost its importance\"."]}, {"page": "Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature", "response": ["The project was founded by Jeremy Black in 1997 and is based at the Oriental Institute of the University of Oxford in Britain.

Representations are especially common on cylinder seals of the Akkadian Empire ( 2334 \u2013 2154 BC). These show that the Bull was clearly envisioned as a bull of abnormally large size and ferocity. It is unclear exactly what the Bull of Heaven represents, however. Michael Rice speculates that the Bull may represent an earthquake, since bulls in general were widely associated with earthquakes in ancient cultures. He also posits that the Bull may represent summertime, which was a period of drought and infertility for people in ancient Mesopotamia. Assyriologists Jeremy Black and Anthony Green observe that the Bull of Heaven is identified with the constellation Taurus and argue that the reason why Enkidu hurls the bull's thigh at Ishtar in the Epic of Gilgamesh after defeating it may be an effort to explain why the constellation seems to be missing its hind quarters."]}]}}
