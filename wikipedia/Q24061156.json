Coventry had an early corner but it passed through the penalty area without anyone able to connect. Hemmings then stopped playing after he thought he had been fouled, but the referee adjudged that there was no infringement and Coventry were able to mount an attack. Beavon's shot was saved by Eastwood, however. Coventry dominated the opening ten minutes of the second half and went close to a second goal when Thomas beat the United defence, though the attack broke down when his cross was off target. Thomas then forced Eastwood to make a difficult save from a close-range shot. On 55 minutes City finally made the breakthrough: once again it was Thomas who had the chance, receiving a cross from the edge of the area by Reid and firing the resulting volley low into the corner of the goal. The BBC Sports correspondents covering the game described it as a \"stunning, stunning goal\". Oxford made a substitution, replacing Ledson with Sercombe, and responded positively once again to conceding but remained unable to penetrate the City defence. Coventry made their first substitution on the hour mark as Willis went off injured, replaced by Dion Kelly-Evans.", "|DF ||30|| Dion Kelly-Evans || || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["|20||Dion Kelly-Evans||RB||||Coventry||||34||0||Academy||1 June 2014||Trainee||30 June 2018", "| 20 ||  || Dion Kelly-Evans || DF || 1+1 || 0+1 || || 3 || 6", "| 20 ||  || Dion Kelly-Evans || DF || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 2"]}, {"page": "Tom Bayliss", "response": ["Bayliss made his professional debut coming on as a substitute on 7 November 2017 in a 2\u20131 EFL Trophy win over West Brom U23's, coming on to replace Dion Kelly-Evans.
