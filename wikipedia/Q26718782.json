He married Anne Orr in Parramatta, New South Wales on 15 January 1835. They later moved to England.\nIn 1859 he bought Buscot Park where he lived until his death in 1887.\nHe was elected MP for Helston at a by-election in May 1866 but was unseated in July 1866. The by-election had originally recorded 153 votes for both him and his rival, William Brett, but Campbell was declared elected after the Returning officer (who was the father of his election agent) cast a vote for him, after consulting a legal textbook which suggested he could make the casting vote.\nA petition was lodged, and a committee decided the returning officer had no right to cast the vote and should have declared both candidates elected. However, on scrutiny one vote was taken from Campbell's total, leaving Brett elected alone. This election led to Parliament deciding that \"according to the law and usage of Parliament, it is the duty of the sheriff or other returning officer in England, in the case of an equal number of votes being polled for two or more candidates at an election, to return all such candidates\".In 1877, Campbell's daughter Edith married Herbert Reuter, of Reuters. Within a few days of her death in 1915, Reuter killed himself.His daughter Florence married Charles Bravo and was suspected of his murder, dying in 1878 of alcohol poisoning.Campbell's son Robert Campbell (1843\u20131889) went into politics in New Zealand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Campbell", "response": ["* Robert Campbell (Nova Scotia politician) (1718\u20131775), merchant and political figure in Nova Scotia", "* Robert Campbell (Canadian politician) (1818\u20131887), Canadian lumber merchant and politician", "* Robert Campbell (Alberta politician) (1871\u20131965), member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta", "* Robert Campbell (Prince Edward Island politician) (1922\u20131992)", "* Robert Campbell (Scottish politician), MP for Argyllshire, 1766\u20131772", "* Robert Campbell (Liberal politician) (died 1887), MP for Helston 1866", "* Robert Campbell (Northern Ireland politician), MPA for North Down, 1973\u20131974", "* Robert Campbell (New York politician) (1808\u20131870), American politician", "* Robert Campbell (Wisconsin politician) (fl. 1840s), member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "* Robert Campbell (California politician) (1937\u20132020), member of the California state assembly", "* Robert Campbell (1769\u20131846), Australian merchant/politician from New South Wales", "* Robert Campbell (Australian politician) (1804\u20131859), New South Wales politician", "* Robert Campbell (New Zealand politician) (1843\u20131889), New Zealand politician", "* Robert Campbell (football manager) (fl. 1896\u20131905), Scottish manager of Bristol City and first Bradford City side", "* Robert Campbell (footballer, born 1882) (1882\u20131931), with Partick Thistle, Rangers and Bradford City", "* Robert Campbell (footballer, born 1883) (1883\u20131942), Celtic and Rangers", "* Robert Campbell (rugby league) (born 1971), Australian who also played internationally for Russia", "* Robert Campbell (Australian rules footballer) (born 1982), for the Hawthorn Football Club", "* Robert Campbell (footballer, born 1986), Scottish footballer with East Fife F.C.", "* Robert Campbell (curler) (born 1966), Canadian curler", "* Robert Campbell of Glenlyon (1630\u20131696), Scottish officer implicated in the Massacre of Glencoe", "* Robert Campbell (frontiersman) (1804\u20131879), 19th century Irish-American frontiersman, and businessman in St. Louis, Missouri", "* Robert Campbell (fur trader) (1808\u20131894), fur trader of the Hudson's Bay Company and explorer of the Yukon", "* Robert Campbell (advocate) (1814\u20131868), advocate, hymn writer and translator", "* Robert Campbell (bishop) (1884\u20131977), bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Liberia", "* Robert Campbell (art gallery director) (1902\u20131972), Australian painter and director of State art Galleries in the mid twentieth century", "* Robert Campbell (journalist) (born 1937), architecture journalist with the Boston Globe"]}, {"page": "Charles Bravo", "response": ["Charles Bravo was born Charles Delauney Turner in St Pancras, London, and baptised in Saint Helier, Jersey, in 1852.
