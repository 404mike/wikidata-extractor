Hogarth himself painted a portrait of Thomas Coram for the hospital, and he also donated his Moses Brought Before Pharaoh's Daughter. His painting March of the Guards to Finchley was also obtained by the hospital after Hogarth donated lottery tickets for a sale of his works, and the hospital won it. Another noteworthy piece is Roubiliac's bust of Handel. The hospital also owned several paintings illustrating life in the institution by Emma Brownlow, daughter of the hospital's administrator. In the chapel, the altarpiece was originally Adoration of the Magi by Casali, but this was deemed to look too Catholic by the hospital's Anglican governors, and it was replaced by Benjamin West's picture of Christ presenting a little child. William Hallett, cabinet maker to nobility, produced all the wood panelling with ornate carving, for the court room."]}, {"page": "1832 in art", "response": ["* Approximate date \u2013 Emma Brownlow, English genre painter (died 1905)"]}, {"page": "1858 in art", "response": ["* Emma Brownlow \u2013 The Foundling Restored to its Mother"]}, {"page": "1905 in art", "response": ["* date unknown \u2013 Emma Brownlow, English-born genre painter (b. c.1832)"]}]}}
