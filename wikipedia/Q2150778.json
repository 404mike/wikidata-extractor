Twiss introduced the intensity interferometer concept to radio astronomy for measuring the tiny angular size of stars, suggesting that it might work with visible light as well. Soon after they successfully tested that suggestion: in 1956 they published an in-lab experimental mockup using blue light from a mercury-vapor lamp, and later in the same year, they applied this technique to measuring the size of Sirius. In the latter experiment, two photomultiplier tubes, separated by a few meters, were aimed at the star using crude telescopes, and a correlation was observed between the two fluctuating intensities. Just as in the radio studies, the correlation dropped away as they increased the separation (though over meters, instead of kilometers), and they used this information to determine the apparent angular size of Sirius."]}, {"page": "Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer", "response": ["The Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer (NSII) was the first astronomical instrument to measure the diameters of a large number of stars at visible wavelengths. It was designed by (amongst others) Robert Hanbury Brown, who received the Hughes Medal in 1971 for this work. It was built by University of Sydney School of Physics and was located near the town of Narrabri in north-central New South Wales, Australia. Many of the components were constructed in the UK. The design was based on an earlier optical intensity interferometer built by Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss at Jodrell Bank in the UK. Whilst the original device had a maximum baseline of 10m, the NSII device consisted of a large circular track that allowed the detectors to be separated from 10 to 188m. The NSII operated from 1963 until 1974, and was used to measure the angular diameters of 32 stars."]}, {"page": "Twiss", "response": ["* Richard Q.

Twiss to construct the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer.  When he returned, Ney left behind a working instrument, but with the advice of Fred Hoyle, who he met in Australia, had decided to focus his attention on a field of broader scope: infrared astronomy.  His students, Wayne Stein and Fred Gillett,  who had participated in the eclipse expeditions, were eager to work in this area.  At this time, there were only two infrared astronomers: Frank J. Low, at the University of Arizona, and Gerry Neugebauer at the California Institute of Technology.  To learn more, Ney and his technician, Jim Stoddart, went to Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, where Low, who Ney dubbed \"The Pope of infrared astronomy\", familiarized them with his newly developed low temperature bolometers.  After Stein completed his Ph.D. in 1964, he went to Princeton University to help Professor Robert E. Danielson, an earlier Ney student, carry out infrared observations on Stratoscope II.  Similarly, Larry Peterson convinced Gillett to begin a program in infrared astronomy at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
