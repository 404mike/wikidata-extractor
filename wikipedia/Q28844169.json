In 1921, once its longer-term premises in South Road were usable, it moved there.Birkbeck p. 7 At this stage, it was run by trustees under the name of the 'Harrington and Trollope Secondary School', after Robert Harrington and William Trollope, two local seventeenth-century philanthropists whose bequests had been made for the poor and the school of Bourne respectively.
