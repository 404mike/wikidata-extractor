Its activities included organising conferences, field trips, seminars and specialist research groups and publishing the journal, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers. The RGS and IBG co-existed for 60 years until 1992 when a merger was discussed. In 1994, members were balloted and the merger agreed. In January 1995, the new Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) was formed."]}, {"page": "Hanley, Staffordshire", "response": ["* Hilda Ormsby (1877\u20131973) a British academic and geographer."]}, {"page": "Ormsby (surname)", "response": ["*Hilda Ormsby, (1877-1973), British geographer"]}, {"page": "Embanking of the tidal Thames", "response": ["Hilda Ormsby \u2014 one of the first to write a modern geographical textbook on London \u2014 visualised the scene:"]}]}}
