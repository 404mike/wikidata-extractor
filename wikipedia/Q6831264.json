He was well known as a defender of environmental influences on intelligence, and as an opponent of IQ, and he was regularly involved in the controversies surrounding that area of research (see, e.g., Howe, 1997b). As a widely cited example of this work, with colleagues Davidson & Sloboda he argued against the existence of innate talent, a position welcomed by some, but characterised as \"Absurd environmentalism\" by researchers such as Douglas Detterman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tabula rasa", "response": ["There have been claims by a minority in psychology and neurobiology, however, that the brain is tabula rasa only for certain behaviours.

The aggressive marketing strategy also received a lot of criticism. The book received positive reviews by some researchers, many of whom were personally associated with Rushton and with the Pioneer Fund which funded much of Rushton's research. The book has been examined as an example of Pioneer's funding of \"scientific racist\" research, while psychologist Michael Howe has identified the book as part of a movement, begun in the 1990s, to promote a racial agenda in social policy."]}, {"page": "Howe (surname)", "response": ["* Michael Howe (bushranger) (1787\u20131818), Australian bushranger", "* Michael Howe (psychologist) (1940\u20132002), British cognitive psychologist"]}, {"page": "Michael Howe", "response": ["Michael Howe may refer to:", "*Michael Howe (bushranger) (1787\u20131818), Tasmanian bushranger", "*Michael Howe (psychologist) (1940\u20132002), British cognitive psychologist", "*Michael Howe (politician)"]}, {"page": "Michael J.
