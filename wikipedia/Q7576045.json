He introduced strict training methods to the club, the emphasis being on fitness, using activities such as running and gymnastics. These were combined with relaxed sessions of snooker and billiards. The \"Valiants\" were in the Third Division North, and had spent the majority of the 1935\u201336 season without a manager. He signed winger Gerry Kelly from Chester; right-half Tommy Ward from Grimsby Town; and left-half Spencer Evans from Altrincham. He also traded George Stabb to Bradford Park Avenue for Tom Nolan. Results began poorly, and so Cresswell signed inside-forward Alfred Dickinson from Everton. Vale then became hard to beat, and remained undefeated for thirteen matches between 24 October and 2 January, with central player Fred Obrey proving to be a revelation. The team were in fourth place at the turn of the year, however results then tailed off, and Cresswell left the club after the campaign ended with an eleventh-place finish."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["*Spencer Evans, Welsh footballer in the 1930s"]}, {"page": "Robert Spencer Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Spencer Evans"]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["During the pre-season build-up, former England international full-back Warney Cresswell was appointed as manager-coach, filling a position which had remained vacant since September 1936.

Cresswell also began running the players and pushing them in the gym, in order to get them fit for the season. In between heavy training sessions he encouraged the players to relax with snooker and billiards competitions.
