Many paintings were inspired by his family life with his wife, often using his children and grandchildren as models. Millais also used his sister-in-law, Sophie Gray, then in her early teens, as the basis of some striking images in the mid to late 1850s, provoking suggestions of a mutual infatuation.Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais"]}, {"page": "John Everett Millais", "response": ["Effie's younger sister Sophie Gray sat for several pictures by Millais, prompting some speculation about the nature of their apparently fond relationship.Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife"]}, {"page": "Boughton Monchelsea", "response": ["* Thomas Musgrave Joy, painter, was born here in 1812.Suzanne Fagence Cooper, \u2018Joy, Thomas Musgrave (1812\u20131866)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 5 Oct 2013"]}, {"page": "The Mystical Nativity", "response": ["From the moment Botticelli's art is shown in Manchester there's a real change in opinion about his work and certainly by the late 1870s, 1880s Botticelli becomes a real cult figure \u2013 somebody the artists who aspire to be on the cutting edge of the art world are looking to...Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones both adapted elements of it for their own work.

Two of her five elder brothers died before her birth and two passed away before she was seven.See family tree in Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais at pp 240\u20131", "The family lived at Bowerswell, a house re-built in 1842 near the foot of Kinnoull Hill, south-east of Perth. As a child, Gray frequently visited and stayed with her sister Effie in London with her husband, the critic and artist John Ruskin. To an extent Effie, who was fifteen years older than Sophie, acted as a kind of second mother to her and Effie's other siblings. From a young age Gray was exposed to the increasingly strained circumstances of the Ruskins' unconsummated marriage.Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais, chapter 12 In fact, through her increasing presence in the Ruskin household, Gray may, in some respects, have been a convenient chaperone for her elder sister, whose largely independent social life tended to attract comment.Robert Brownell (2013) Marriage of Inconvenience According to Effie, Ruskin's manservant, Frederick Crawley, expressed to Gray his concern that other servants might spread gossip \"all over Camberwell.\" Gray's governess of three years, a French woman named Delphine, appears to have been discharged by the Grays in March 1854 because of Gray's habit of confiding in her.", "For the next few years Gray continued to sit for Millais. After he and Effie moved to Annat Lodge, close to Bowerswell, she was readily available for this purpose, but while it seems she was beginning to displace Effie herself as a favored subject, it is unsurprising that Effie wanted to keep herself out of the public eye to a degree, following the very public dissolution of her marriage.  In the words of art historian Suzanne Fagence Cooper, whose biographical chapter about Gray (2010) provides the fullest account of her life, Gray \"changes before our eyes from a child to a stunning teenager.\" This change can be traced in three works by Millais: Autumn Leaves (1855\u201356), Spring (or Apple Blossoms) (1856\u20131859) and, most strikingly, in a small, but \"unnerving\" portrait of her at the age of 13, entitled Portrait of a Young Lady, or simply Sophie Gray (1857).Tate Britain, Millais, 2007, pp.134-135 Charles Edward Perugini also painted a portrait of Gray as a young woman; the date is not known with certainty and for some years it was attributed mistakenly to Millais.
