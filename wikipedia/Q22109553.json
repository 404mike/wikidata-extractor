This fish was first described by James William Davis in 1887 and was named in honour of Professor E. R. Lewis of the American College in Beirut. Professor Lewis had originally found the fossil at Sahel Alma on Mount Lebanon. In this famous fossil location, about sixty species of fish have been found, none of them known from elsewhere in the world. Cheirothrix lewisii is characterized by enormous pectoral fins and the ventral lobe of the tail fin is also much enlarged. It seems likely that these fish could launch themselves out of the water and glide hundreds of metres (yards) through the air, probably to evade predators."]}]}}
