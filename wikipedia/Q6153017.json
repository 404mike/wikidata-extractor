Experimental composers (such as John Cage, Halim El-Dabh, and Pierre Schaeffer) used them to sample and create music that was entirely produced by the turntable. Cage's Imaginary Landscape No. 1 (1939) is composed for two variable speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano and cymbal. Edgard Var\u00e8se experimented with turntables even earlier in 1930, though he never formally produced any works using them. Though this school of thought and practice is not directly linked to the 1970s-2010 definition of turntablism within hip hop and DJ culture, it has had an influence on modern experimental sonic/artists such as Christian Marclay, Janek Schaefer, Otomo Yoshihide, Philip Jeck, and Maria Chavez. Turntablism as it is known today, however, did not surface until the advent of hip hop in the 1970s."]}, {"page": "List of ambient music artists", "response": ["* Janek Schaefer"]}, {"page": "Unusual types of gramophone records", "response": ["*In 1997, English Sound Artist Janek Schaefer released his first ever record, \"His Master's Voices\" a transparent two sided LP.

Known for the discovery of artists such as Felix Kubin, Janek Schaefer, and many more, they were also instrumental in the deconstruction of Detroit techno classics with releases such as V/Vm 'String Up Your Wife', as well as being involved in many controversial art world and performance based situations across the British Isles and Europe in the late 90's- early 2000s. Diskono were also the first and only Scottish artists to be awarded a major Scottish Arts Council grant from submission under pseudonym with the resulting exhibition, Revisionland with Alejandra and Aeron going on to win the 2002 Prix Ars Electronica award in Linz, Austria.
