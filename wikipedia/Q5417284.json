In May 1536, in the immediate aftermath of the execution of his second wife, Anne Boleyn (Merle Oberon), King Henry VIII (Charles Laughton) marries Jane Seymour (Wendy Barrie), who dies in childbirth eighteen months later. He then weds a German princess, Anne of Cleves (played by Laughton's real-life wife Elsa Lanchester). This marriage ends in divorce when Anne deliberately makes herself unattractive so she can be free to marry her sweetheart. (In an imaginative and high-spirited scene, Anne \"wins her freedom\" from Henry in a game of cards on their wedding night.) After this divorce, Henry marries the beautiful and ambitious Lady Katherine Howard (Binnie Barnes). She has rejected love all her life in favour of ambition, but after her marriage, she finally falls in love with Henry's handsome courtier Thomas Culpeper (Robert Donat), who has attempted to woo her in the past. Their liaison is discovered by Henry's court and the two are executed. The weak and aging Henry consoles himself with a final marriage to Catherine Parr (Everley Gregg), who proves domineering. In the final scene, while Parr is no longer in the room, the king breaks the fourth wall, saying \"Six wives, and the best of them's the worst.\""]}, {"page": "Freedom Radio", "response": ["* Everley Gregg as Maria Tattenheim"]}, {"page": "List of female movie actors by name: G", "response": ["*Everley Gregg (1888\u20131959)"]}, {"page": "The Ghost Goes West", "response": ["* Everley Gregg as Mrs. Martin"]}, {"page": "Pygmalion (1938 film)", "response": ["* Everley Gregg as Mrs. Eynsford-Hill"]}, {"page": "The Demi-Paradise", "response": ["* Everley Gregg as Mrs. Flannel"]}, {"page": "Danger List", "response": ["* Everley Gregg as Neighbour "]}, {"page": "Lost (1956 film)", "response": ["* Everley Gregg as Viscountess ", "Allmovie wrote, \"This nail-biting film is filled to capacity with many of Britain's top supporting players, including Thora Hird, Everley Gregg, Joan Sims, Shirley Anne Field, Joan Hickson, Dandy Nichols, Mona Washbourne, Barbara Windsor and George Woodbridge\"; and the Radio Times wrote, \"this film succeeds because it confronts every parent's nightmare: what happens when you suddenly look away and find your child is missing when you look back? Of course, this being a class-riddled Rank picture, it's the nanny who loses the baby, but it's pretty harrowing nonetheless, despite the casting of insipid David Knight and Julia Arnall as baby Simon's parents. Granite-faced cop David Farrar is on hand to bring grit to screenwriter Janet Green's earnest chase movie, and not-so-hidden among the red herrings are a welter of British character players, with particularly impressive work from Thora Hird.
