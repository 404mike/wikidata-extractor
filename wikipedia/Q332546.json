A number of prominent Conservative MPs lost their seats in the election, including Michael Portillo, Malcolm Rifkind, Edwina Currie, David Mellor, Neil Hamilton and Norman Lamont. Such was the extent of Conservative losses at the election that Cecil Parkinson, speaking on the BBC's election night programme, joked upon the Conservatives winning their second seat that he was pleased that the subsequent election for the leadership would be contested."]}, {"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["Unlike when Peter Thorneycroft (Chancellor of the Exchequer) resigned in 1958 or Lord Carrington (Foreign Secretary) in 1982, Heseltine's junior ministers Norman Lamont and John Lee did not resign with him. Heseltine was portrayed by Spitting Image as a swivel-eyed lunatic holding a toy helicopter.Crick 1997, pp. 295\u20136.", "Heseltine was disappointed not to receive the support of old allies on the second ballot; these included Secretary of State for Defence Tom King (whom he asked in vain to second his nomination, but who was angry at a leadership contest when British troops were soon to go to war in Kuwait and supported Douglas Hurd), Cecil Parkinson and Norman Lamont (who managed John Major's campaign).Michael Heseltine, Life in the Jungle, Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, , p. 370. Over the weekend on 24\u201325 November, many Conservative MPs were faced with the anger of their local party members who overwhelmingly supported Thatcher but did not at that time have a vote in leadership elections, and opinion polls showed that chancellor John Major would also boost Conservative support if leader (previously Heseltine's unique selling-point). Heseltine had never done much to court support among younger MPs the way Major had, and was seen as aloof even by his own supporters. In the second ballot, a week after the first, Heseltine's vote actually fell to 131 (just over 35%) as some MPs had voted for him in the first ballot as a protest against or to try to oust Thatcher but preferred to vote for other candidates now that they had a wider choice. John Major, with 185 votes, was only two votes short of an overall majority. Heseltine immediately and publicly conceded defeat, announcing that he would vote for Major if the third ballot went ahead (it did not, as Hurd, who had finished a distant third, also conceded).Crick 1997, pp. 353\u20138.", "In a May 1990 article Heseltine had proposed that the Poll Tax be reformed rather than abolished.Crick 1997, p. 366. He now had a remit to reform it, and invited the opposition parties to take part in his review of options (Labour did not; the Lib Dems did, and proposed a local income tax). Heseltine insisted that Michael Portillo, who had been a major cheerleader for the tax, be retained as Minister of State for Local Government. Portillo and Robert Key handled the detail and presented Heseltine with a list of options. Various options were leaked to the press to test public reaction, and at one point Heseltine appeared to have settled on a tax graded both according to the size of the property and the number of adults living in it. Major was exasperated by the lack of progress and intervened, and \u2013 at Major's insistence \u2013 Chancellor Norman Lamont increased VAT by 2.5 percentage points to 17.5% in his April 1991 budget so as to provide a \u00a34.5bn subsidy to bring poll tax bills down. Eventually, as expected, the poll tax was abolished and the new Council Tax was graded according to the size of a property, with the only concession to headcount being a single-person discount. In Crick's view, the outcome was much more Sarah Hogg's and Portillo's and Major's doing than Heseltine's.", "On the backbenches Heseltine had praised the Japanese MITI, and had been planning a book on the subject. He promised to intervene \"before breakfast, dinner and tea\" to help British companies, but had little opportunity for intervention as the DTI budget had dropped from over \u00a33bn in the early 1980s to \u00a31bn in 1992\u20131993, a fifth the budget of the Welsh Office. NEDO, which had been set up to coordinate industrial policy in the early 1960s, was abolished by Chancellor Norman Lamont in June 1992, although Heseltine was able to absorb some of the staff into the DTI to set up working parties to shadow specific industries. His junior ministers were Neil Hamilton and Edward Leigh, both Thatcherites. Gordon Brown mocked him (6 July 1992) as having \"absolute power over a department which has become absolutely powerless\" and \"the tiger that was once the king of the jungle is now just the fireside rug \u2013 decorative and ostentatious, but essentially there to be walked all over\".Crick 1997, pp. 381\u20134."]}, {"page": "Chancellor of the Exchequer", "response": ["| rowspan=2 | Norman Lamont"]}, {"page": "1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["Parliament was due to expire no later than 16 June 1992.

The following year he was promoted as Minister of State in the DSS with responsibility for Social Security and Disabled People.
