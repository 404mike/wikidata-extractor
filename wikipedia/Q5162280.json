Nevertheless, news of Yeltsin's insubordination and \"secret speech\" spread, and soon samizdat versions began to circulate. This marked the beginning of Yeltsin's rebranding as a rebel and rise in popularity as an anti-establishment figure. The following four years of political struggle between Yeltsin and Gorbachev played a large role in the dissolution of the USSR. On November 11, 1987, Yeltsin was fired from the post of First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party.", "This was also the year that CNN became the first non-Soviet broadcaster allowed to beam its TV news programs to Moscow. Officially, CNN was available only to foreign guests in the Savoy Hotel, but Muscovites quickly learned how to pick up signals on their home televisions. That had a major impact on how Soviets saw events in their country, and made censorship almost impossible.Pages 188\u2013189. Conor O'Clery.

On the ground in Crimea, what is particularly odd is that the most vociferous defenders of Russian bases against supposed fascists appear to hold far-right views themselves.\" In August 2014, BBC News reported, \"Russian state TV's coverage of the crisis has been consistently sensationalist, using a wide repertoire of propaganda techniques to incite revulsion and hostility towards the authorities in Kiev.\" The Institute of Modern Russia wrote, \"Inside Russia, and in areas of eastern Ukraine where Russian television is popular, the Kremlin's political technologists have managed to create a parallel reality where \"fascists\" have taken power in Kiev, ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine are in mortal danger and the CIA is waging a war against Moscow.\" In March 2014, historian Timothy D. Snyder rejected the claims of a \"fascist coup\", stating \"Although one can certainly debate the constitutional nuances, this process was not a coup. And it certainly was not fascist. Reducing the powers of the president, calling presidential elections, and restoring the principles of democracy are the opposite of what fascism would demand.\" Some observers were critical of the Russian media's heavy focus on radical and right-wing groups during Euromaidan, finding that the protests were broad-based. Commenting in the Kyiv Post on \"fascist\" accusations against Ukraine, Lily Hyde wrote, \"Today's Russia, with its focus on a strong leader, primacy of the state, and aggressive imperial ambitions, is far more text-book \"fascist\" than Ukraine.\" The Kyiv Post's Oleg Sukhov and BBC News' Stephen Ennis accused Russian media of \"demonization\" of Ukrainians. Sukhov said Russian media regularly used fascist labels \"without pointing out the relatively low support for far-right groups among the Ukrainian population or the presence of neo-Nazis among Russian-backed insurgents,\" and he criticized their presentation of the Ukrainian crisis as \"orchestrated by the United States while ignoring Russia's direct involvement in support of separatists.\" Bernard-Henri Levy said the claims of \"fascism\" in Ukraine were part of a \"misinformation campaign.\" Sergei Loiko, a Los Angeles Times correspondent interviewed by Novoye Vremya Ukraine, criticized Russian channels, saying \"there were no reasons for [this war]. They are all fictional. They are built on lies, spread by Russian television. There was no reason for people to kill each other.
