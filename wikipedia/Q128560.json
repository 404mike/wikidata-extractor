Combining literary acclaim with widespread popularity, Greene acquired a reputation early in his lifetime as a major writer, both of serious Catholic novels, and of thrillers (or \"entertainments\" as he termed them). He was shortlisted, in 1966 and 1967, for the Nobel Prize for Literature. Through 67 years of writing, which included over 25 novels, he explored the conflicting moral and political issues of the modern world. He was awarded the 1968 Shakespeare Prize and the 1981 Jerusalem Prize.\nHe converted to Catholicism in 1926 after meeting his future wife, Vivien Dayrell-Browning. Later in life he took to calling himself a \"Catholic agnostic\". \nHe died in 1991, at age 86, of leukemia, and was buried in Corseaux cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 3", "response": ["*  1991   \u2013 Graham Greene, English novelist, playwright, and critic (b. 1904)"]}, {"page": "Booker Prize", "response": ["As part of The Times Literature Festival in Cheltenham, a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival.

In the view of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, it was not until the first volumes of Anthony Powell's sequence, A Dance to the Music of Time, were published in the 1950s, that an English novelist achieved the same command of atmosphere and precision of language with consistency, a view supported by later critics like A. N. Wilson; Powell acknowledged his debt to Conrad.
