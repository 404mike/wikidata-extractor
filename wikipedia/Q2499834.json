Although emphasis is useful in speech, and so has a place in informal or journalistic writing, in academic traditions it is often suggested that italics are only used where there is a danger of misunderstanding the meaning of the sentence, and even in that case that rewriting the sentence is preferable; in formal writing the reader is expected to interpret and understand the text themselves, without the assumption that the precise intended interpretation of the author is correct. Italics are principally used in academic writing for texts that have been referenced, and for foreign language words. Similarly capitals and underlining have particular meanings, and are rarely used in formal writing for emphasis."]}, {"page": "2004 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Larry Trask, professor of linguistics (born 1944, United States)"]}, {"page": "Acronym", "response": ["Some influential style guides, such as that of the BBC, no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it.
