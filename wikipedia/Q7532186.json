Sitwell came to his father's estates in 1793 and greatly extended and improved Renishaw Hall between 1800 and 1803. He was Member of Parliament for West Looe from 1796 to 1802. In 1808 he was created a Baronet, of Renishaw in the County of Derby.\nSitwell married twice, firstly to Alice Parke, daughter of Thomas Parke in 1791 and secondly to Sarah Stovin in 1798. He was succeeded by his son Sir George Sitwell, 2nd Baronet.\nHis daughter Anne married Sir Frederick Stovin in 1815; this was an unusual marriage, as Stovin was the younger brother of Sarah, Sitwell's second wife and Anne's stepmother.His memorial is in St Peter and St Paul's Church, Eckington.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with reduplicated names", "response": ["* Sir Sitwell Sitwell, 1st Bt.
