His 17 league goals made a major contribution to the club winning promotion from the Second Division in 1984\u201385. His season in the top flight with Birmingham was interrupted by suspension and minor injuries, and he only managed five goals as the side were relegated, which included scoring twice in Birmingham's 3\u20130 win in the local derby away to Aston Villa. In 1986\u201387, Clarke again scored 19 goals, which again made him leading scorer. With Birmingham struggling to avoid further relegation to the Third Division and in financial difficulties, the club accepted an offer from Everton who were in need of an emergency replacement for the injured Graeme Sharp. Clarke joined Everton in March 1987 together with inexperienced reserve striker Stuart Storer, the pair jointly valued at \u00a3300,000. Former club Wolves complained to the Football League because they believed Birmingham were deliberately inflating the valuation placed on Storer to reduce the amount they would owe Wolves under the sell-on clause for Clarke. Birmingham's actions may have been an attempt to recoup money lost on the 1981 sale of Joe Gallagher to Wolves, when the club was declared bankrupt the following year still owing most of the \u00a3350,000 fee."]}, {"page": "Mick Rathbone", "response": ["He turned professional in November 1976, and played 16 games in the First Division over the course of the 1976\u201377 season, but his form dipped and he appeared only rarely over the next 18 months.Matthews, pp. 212\u201314.
