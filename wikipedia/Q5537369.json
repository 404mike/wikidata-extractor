He was in the Admiral's Men/Lord Strange's Men production of The Seven Deadly Sins, c. 1591, with Augustine Phillips and William Sly and other future Lord Chamberlain's Men. Bryan may also have toured with the same group of actors under Edward Alleyn in 1593. He is generally believed to have been one of the original members and sharers in the Lord Chamberlain's Men when that company was re-constituted in 1594; he certainly was a key member in 1596, when he and John Heminges received payment for a performance at Court. After that point, however, he apparently left the theatrical profession, seemingly around 1597. In 1603 and in the 1611\u201313 period, he was recorded as a Groom of the Chamber under James I.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Bryan (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Bryan (1731\u20131791) was a Pennsylvania businessman, statesman and politician of the Revolutionary era.", "George Bryan may also refer to:", "*George Bryan (actor) (fl. 1586\u20131613), actor in English Renaissance theatre", "*George Bryan (politician, died 1843), Irish Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons", "*George Bryan (British businessman) (1921\u20132013), British founder and owner of Drayton Manor Theme Park", "*George Bryan (curler), Scottish curler"]}, {"page": "George Bryan (16th-century actor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Bryan (actor)"]}]}}
