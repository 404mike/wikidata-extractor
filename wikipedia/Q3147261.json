Glory signed veteran Jamie Harnwell to a new one-year deal for the 2010\u201311 season. The club also went on to sign Perth products Jamie Coyne and Todd Howarth to contract extensions, before signing left-back Josh Mitchell and striker Michael Baird, who had played together for Romanian club Universitatea Craiova.

Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan\u2014who would act as inaugural club chairman\u2014also strengthened its proposal.
