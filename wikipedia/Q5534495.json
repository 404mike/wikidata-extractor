In 1964, he was the Senior Wrangler at Cambridge, the best performer in the mathematics tripos. In the same year, he also played in the annual chess match against Oxford University.He received a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Cambridge University in 1967 and held positions at Caltech, Syracuse University and Florida State University before becoming being appointed professor at Indiana University, where he is director of the Digital Science Center and Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies at the School of Informatics and Computing\nHe has supervised the Ph.D. of 65 students and published over 1200 publications in physics and computer science according to Google Scholar, including his book Parallel Computing Works!.He currently works to apply computer science to bioinformatics, defense, earthquake and ice-sheet science, particle physics and chemical informatics. He is principal investigator of FutureGrid \u2013 a new cyberinfrastructure test to enable development of new approaches to scientific computing. He is involved in several projects to enhance the capabilities of Minority Serving Institutions.\nIn 1989, he was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society \"for contributions centered on novel uses of computers; firstly, in the phenomenological comparison of theory and experiment in particle physics, and secondly, in the design and use of parallel computers\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stephen Wolfram", "response": ["Wolfram, at the age of 15, began research in applied quantum field theory and particle physics and published scientific papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals including Nuclear Physics B, Australian Journal of Physics, Nuovo Cimento, and Physical Review D. Working independently, Wolfram published a widely cited paper on heavy quark production at age 18 and nine other papers. Wolfram's work with Geoffrey C.
