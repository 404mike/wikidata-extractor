He was the original director of the world's longest-running production The Mousetrap, still playing at the St Martins Theatre, London. He wrote several books, including an acclaimed biography of Charlie Chaplin in 1951.He was twice married: Myfanwy Jones (marriage annulled) and Joan Miller (widowed 1988).

He was one of the great drolls of our time\". Le Mesurier's fellow Dad's Army actor Bill Pertwee mourned the loss of his friend, saying, \"It's a shattering loss. He was a great professional, very quiet but with a lovely sense of humour\". Director Peter Cotes, writing in The Guardian, called him one of Britain's \"most accomplished screen character actors\", while The Times obituarist observed that he \"could lend distinction to the smallest part\".", "Philip French of The Observer considered that when playing a representative of bureaucracy, Le Mesurier \"registered something\u00a0... complex. A feeling of exasperation, disturbance, anxiety [that] constantly lurked behind that handsome bloodhound face\". The impression he gave in these roles became an \"inimitable brand of bewildered persistence under fire which Le Mesurier made his own\". The Times noted of him that although he was best known for his comedic roles, he, \"could be equally effective in straight parts\", as evidenced by his BAFTA-award-winning role in Traitor. Director Peter Cotes agreed, adding, \"he had depths unrealised through the mechanical pieces in which he generally appeared\"; while Philip Oakes considered that, \"single-handed, he has made more films watchable, even absorbing, than anyone else around\"."]}, {"page": "The Mousetrap", "response": ["As a stage play, The Mousetrap had its world premiere at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham on 6 October 1952.

It ran at this theatre until Saturday, 23 March 1974 when it immediately transferred to the larger St Martin's Theatre, next door, where it reopened on Monday, 25 March thus keeping its \"initial run\" status.

After the performance, Robey visited Kennedy in his dressing room and offered himself as the stooge for his next appearance. They agreed that Robey, as his young apprentice, would be \"mesmerised\" into singing a comic song. At a later rehearsal, Robey negotiated a deal to sing one of the comic songs that had been written for him by Rogers. Robey's turn was a great success, and as a result he secured a permanent theatrical residency at the venue.Cotes, pp. 25\u201326. Later that year, he appeared as a solo act at the Oxford Music Hall,Cotes, p. 6. where he performed \"The Simple Pimple\" and \"He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now\".Cotes, pp. 13\u201314. The theatrical press soon became aware of his act, and The Stage called him a \"comedian with a pretty sense of humour [who] delivers his songs with considerable point and meets with all success\".\"Mr George Robey\", The Stage, 22 October 1891, p. 4. In early 1892, together with his performances at the Royal Aquarium and the Oxford Music Hall, Robey starred alongside Jenny Hill, Bessie Bonehill and Harriet Vernon at the Paragon Theatre of Varieties in Mile End, where, according to his biographer Peter Cotes, he \"stole the notices from experienced troupers\".Cotes, p. 42.", "The revue Robey en Casserole (1921) was next for Robey, during which he led a troupe of dancers in a musical piece called the \"Policemen Ballet\". Each dancer was dressed in a mock police uniform on top and a tutu below. The show was the first failure for the comedian under Stoll's management. That December Robey appeared in his only London pantomime, Jack and the Beanstalk, at the Hippodrome.Cotes, p. 66. His biographer, Peter Cotes, remembered the comedian's interpretation of Dame Trot as \"enormously funny: a bucolic caricature of a woman, sturdy and fruity, leathery and forbidding\" and thought that Robey's comic timing was \"in a class of its own.\" In March 1922 Robey remained at the Hippodrome in the revue Round in Fifty, a modernised version of Round the World in Eighty Days, which proved to be another hit for the London theatre, and a personal favourite of the comedian.", "Robey's comic delivery influenced other comedians, but opinions of his effectiveness as a comic vary. The radio personality Robb Wilton acknowledged learning a lot from him, and although he felt that Robey \"was not very funny\", he could time a comic situation perfectly. Similarly, the comedian Charlie Chester admitted that, as a comedian, Robey \"still didn't make me laugh,\" although he described him as \"a legend\" whose Prime Minister of Mirth character used a beautiful make-up design.Cotes, p. 167. Robey's biographer Peter Cotes disagreed with these assessments, praising the comedian's \"droll like humour\" and comparing it in greatness to Chaplin's miming and Grock's clowning.Cotes, p. 4. Cotes wrote: \"His Mayor, Professor of Music, Saracen, Dame Trot, Queen of Hearts, District Nurse, Pro's Landlady, and of course his immortal Prime Minister, were all absurdities: rich, outsize in prim and pride, gloriously disapproving bureaucratic petty officialdom at its worst, best and funniest.\"Cotes, p. 179."]}, {"page": "The Right Person", "response": ["The Right Person is a 1955 featurette made in the United Kingdom by Hammer Film Productions.
