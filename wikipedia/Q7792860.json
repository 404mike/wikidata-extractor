Until they fell away somewhat in the late thirties, Notts were one of the most competitive teams and usually in contention. They won the title in 1929 and were runners-up in three other seasons. Noted batsmen were George Gunn, \"Dodge\" Whysall, Arthur Carr, Joe Hardstaff Jr, Charles Harris, Walter Keeton, Wilfred Payton and Willis Walker. Besides Larwood and Voce, Notts had good bowlers in Fred Barratt, Tom Richmond and Sam Staples. Ben Lilley succeeded Thomas Oates as wicket-keeper in 1924 and held the post until he retired in 1937 and was succeeded by Arthur Wheat."]}, {"page": "Oates, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Oates"]}]}}
