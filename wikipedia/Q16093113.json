He was named as Young Cricketer of the Year in 1956 by the Cricket Writers' Club, his first full season, though he had made his first-class debut seven years earlier. He toured South Africa with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side in 1956-57 as understudy to Evans, but did not feature in any of the Test matches as Evans had one of his most brilliant Test series.\nIn the event, his left-handed batting did not develop as much as had been hoped, and the Test call never came. But Taylor still had a long and distinguished career in county cricket. From 1961 to 1972, he played in 301 consecutive County Championship matches for Essex, and he captained the county from 1967 to 1973, when he retired. Under his captaincy, Essex assembled the nucleus of the young team that was to bring the county its first-ever trophies in the years after Taylor retired.\nIn all cricket, Taylor made 1,294 dismissals, which puts him seventh on the all-time list of wicketkeepers. He also made more than 19,000 runs in a total of 572 first-class matches. He was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1972. He was a Test selector for England from 1973. He took part in the first cricket tour of Bangladesh when MCC visited in 1976-77.\nHe also played football with Bexleyheath and Welling and Deal Town in the Kent League and Southern League.\nHe died in 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Brian Taylor"]}, {"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 1,294 (1,083 c, 211 st) || Brian Taylor (Essex) ||572|| from 1949 to 1973"]}, {"page": "1971 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden - Geoff Arnold, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Lance Gibbs, Brian Taylor, Zaheer Abbas"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in South Africa in 1956\u201357", "response": [":Peter May; Doug Insole; Trevor Bailey; Denis Compton; Colin Cowdrey; Godfrey Evans (wicketkeeper); Jim Laker; Peter Loader; Tony Lock; Alan Oakman; Jim Parks junior; Peter Richardson; Brian Statham; Brian Taylor (wicketkeeper); Frank Tyson; Johnny Wardle"]}, {"page": "Neil Smith (cricketer, born 1949)", "response": ["Born at Ossett, Yorkshire, England, Smith had hopes of replacing the long-serving Jimmy Binks behind the stumps for Yorkshire, but found his place taken by the then 18-year-old, David Bairstow.
