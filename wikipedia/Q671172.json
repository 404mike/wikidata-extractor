He is one of a small number of players to have played for both Manchester City and Manchester United.\nHe was named as PFA Young Player of the Year after scoring in the 1976 League Cup final victory for Manchester City. He won 22 England caps, and became West Bromwich Albion's record buy at \u00a3748,000, but found that his career faltered in the mid-1980s. He played for Leeds United and was also a rare English export to La Liga with Real Betis. He played briefly for Coventry City, and was signed by Ron Atkinson at Manchester United in 1985, before being one of the players that Alex Ferguson released after his arrival in the 1986\u201387 season. Over the next few years he struggled for opportunities as wing play went out of fashion, despite trying his hand at clubs throughout the English Football League and in Portugal, Australia, Malta, the United States, Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Drogheda United F.C.", "response": ["* Peter Barnes"]}, {"page": "Jesper Olsen", "response": ["Atkinson signed winger Peter Barnes for United at the start of the 1985\u201386 season, who provided cover on the left wing when Olsen was out of action with injury, but after Olsen regained his fitness and form, Barnes was sold to Manchester City in January 1987."]}, {"page": "Malcolm Allison", "response": ["Allison was given a sizeable war chest to build his team\u00a0\u2014 this time without Joe Mercer.
