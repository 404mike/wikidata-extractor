Known for designing a number of modernist housing estates in London, he had also achieved notability for his work in restoring the Red House, the Arts and Crafts building in Bexleyheath, Southeast London, which was designed by William Morris and Philip Webb in the year 1859.\nBorn in Hammersmith, West London, Hollamby served in the Royal Marines during the Second World War before embarking on his career in architecture. Involved with the Communist Party of Great Britain and other left-wing political groups, his socialist beliefs led him to work in the public sector, first for the Miners' Welfare Commission and then for London County Council (LCC), where he was involved in the design and construction of such modernist post-war housing estates as Bethnal Green's Avebury Estate, Kennington's Brandon Estate, and Deptford's Pepys Estate.\nIn 1952, Hollamby and his family moved into the Red House, undertaking projects to renovate and restore it. A great admirer of the house's original inhabitant, William Morris, he also involved himself in the early activities of the William Morris Society, which held a number of meetings at the property. Awarded an OBE for his career in 1970, from 1969 to 1981 Hollamby worked as Director of Architecture, Planning, and Development for the London Borough of Lambeth, before moving to work for the London Docklands Development Corporation from 1981 to 1985. He continued restoring Red House in his later life, opening it up to visitors and establishing the Friends of Red House non-profit organization in 1998.\nThe Guardian described Hollamby as \"very much an architect of the 20th century, a public servant who believed not just in high quality architecture but in the existence and nurturing of the public realm, of public architecture and civic design.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chartism", "response": ["In Kennington, the Brandon Estate features a large mural by Tony Hollaway, commissioned by London County Council's Edward Hollamby in the early 1960s, commemorating the Chartists' meeting on 10 April 1848."]}, {"page": "Red House, Bexleyheath", "response": ["Red House remained a private residence for various individuals from 1866 until 2002, during which period various alterations were made to the interior design.

In 2012 Lambeth Council proposed demolishing the estate, to replace the terraced houses by apartment blocks. Most of the apartments would then be for sale to the private sector. The residents, those in Lambeth who wish to prevent the gentrification of the borough, and those who want to conserve what they believe to be important architectural heritage, are campaigning to prevent its demolition."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 1999", "response": ["*Edward Hollamby, 78, English architect and town planner, heart disease."]}, {"page": "Tony Hollaway", "response": ["The Brandon Estate in Kennington, south London features a large mural by Hollaway, commissioned by London County Council's Edward Hollamby, commemorating the Chartists' meeting at Kennington Common on 10 April 1848."]}, {"page": "Brandon Estate", "response": ["Brandon Estate is a social housing estate in London Borough of Southwark, south London.

He wrote an article on sustainable architecture in 1982 for the Architects' Journal, after which sustainable architecture became an important part of late-twentieth and twenty-first century architecture. During his career, he won several prizes from the Royal Institute of British Architects. Westman gave guest lectures on architectural history at the AA, Cambridge, Oxford Brookes, and Bath, until 1999."]}]}}
