The inquiry was set up to examine the contents of the report and how it was authored and leaked. It was expected to release its findings in 2021. In Corbyn's submission to the Forde inquiry, submitted jointly with eight other colleagues, he was reported to have accused officials of sabotage and said their diversion of funds could constitute fraud. The diverted funds refer to the \"Bespoke Materials Service\" (sometimes referred to as the 'Ergon House Project'), which represented 1.2 per cent of Labour's total election spend and was focused towards certain Labour-held seats rather than offensive targets. BMS was apparently not disclosed to Corbyn's office. Officials said their targeting was due to fears Labour would lose seats, based on its poor polling position at the start of the campaign, and that three of the seats supported by BMS were less than 500 votes away from being lost to the Conservatives. The 2017 campaigns chief, Patrick Heneghan also stated that Corbyn's office had demanded he divert funds towards a list of Labour-held seats, some with majorities of over 10,000, to help MPs were considered allies of Corbyn, including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett. Heneghan said the use of funds in BMS was legal, as it had been authorised by the General Secretary, and stated it had been kept from Corbyn's office because staffers believed they were \"in a bind\" and \"felt it was pointless to try and discuss this sensibly with Jeremy's staff\""]}, {"page": "Socialist Campaign Group", "response": ["|Jon Trickett"]}, {"page": "Institute of Economic Affairs", "response": ["Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, welcoming the investigation into the IEA, said \"on the road to Brexit, a small group of establishment figures, funded to the tune of millions, are covertly pursuing a political campaign in favour of extreme free trade, acting in effect as lobbyists for secretive corporate interests...there are serious questions that high-ranking Conservative ministers must now answer about their dealings with the IEA.\""]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jon Trickett"]}, {"page": "Owen Paterson", "response": ["In January 2019, it emerged that Paterson had received \u00a339,000 of funding for overseas trips from the thinktank UK 2020, of which Paterson is the chairman and sole director.

He said without information on the true source of donations, \"the register of members' interests is unable to fulfil its vital purpose\".
