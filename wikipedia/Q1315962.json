An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club, star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade. In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of \u00a31, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home. On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983\u201384 and established themselves in the top division with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988\u201389.", "| John Neal"]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["| 1977\u20131981 || John Neal"]}, {"page": "Wrexham A.F.C.", "response": ["1975\u201376 saw John Neal's starlets captained by Eddie May, again shocking the football world by reaching the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup after another sparkling cup run and defeats of several higher quality opponents. In the first round Wrexham beat Swedish team Djurg\u00e5rdens IF 3\u20132 on aggregate. They then managed to knock out Polish side Stal Rzeszow 3\u20131 on aggregate.

He signed for Chelsea as part of manager John Neal's re-building of the side alongside the likes of Kerry Dixon, Pat Nevin and David Speedie. Spackman scored on his debut for the club in a 5\u20130 opening day win over Derby County, though he was not a regular goalscorer. Chelsea were promoted at the end of that season as Second Division champions and finished 6th in the following two seasons back in the top tier, with Spackman a near ever-present. During the 1986\u201387 season, several key players, including Spackman, fell out with manager John Hollins and he was sporadically left out of the starting line-up or played out of position. He was sold to Liverpool in 1987 for \u00a3400,000."]}, {"page": "Joey Jones", "response": ["In 1982, Jones joined Chelsea for \u00a334,000, having been signed by John Neal. Jones was sent off on his debut against Carlisle United at Brunton Park. However, Jones's committed attitude and pre-match fist-clenching ritual eventually made him a cult hero among the fans. He also proved instrumental in Chelsea's successful battle to avoid relegation to the Third Division. He was a part of the side which romped to promotion as Second Division champions in 1983\u201384. He remained with the club in the top flight for one more season, before surprisingly being sold to Huddersfield Town for \u00a335,000 in August 1985. He finished his Chelsea career with 78 league appearances and 2 goals."]}, {"page": "Ken Bates", "response": ["Later in 1982, Bates purchased Chelsea for \u00a31. When he purchased the club they were in serious financial trouble, as well as being tarnished by a notorious hooligan element among their support. They were also struggling in the Football League Second Division, a stark contrast to their successful era from 1955 to 1971, when they had won a Football League First Division title, an FA Cup, Football League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup. After narrowly escaping relegation to the Third Division in the 1982\u201383 season, Bates made the funds available to manager John Neal to sign players including Kerry Dixon, David Speedie, Pat Nevin, Mickey Thomas, Eddie Niedzwiecki and Nigel Spackman, who helped the club win promotion and re-establish themselves in the top-flight with consecutive top six finishes."]}]}}
