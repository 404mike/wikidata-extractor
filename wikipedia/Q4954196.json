On 31 December 2012, Loy made his first appearance since his injury, coming on as a substitute for Brad Potts, in a 1\u20130 loss against Crewe. Upon his return, Manager Greg Abbott said Loy has returned more sharp and positive. At the start of February, Loy scored against Tranmere Rovers, Stevenage and Portsmouth in three consecutive games. After scoring in one of the matches, Loy says was delighted to make his return and that his absence helped him appreciate playing first-team football. At the end of the season, Loy was among seven players to be released, upon the expiry of their contract. Days after his release, Loy attracted interest from a number of teams, according to his agent. While Loy, himself, says on Twitter: \"Met some people and made some memories at #cufc that will stick with me forever. Two years gone by in a flash. Loved every minute. Some real nice messages from the #cufc fans. Nice touch and always nice to know you were appreciated.
