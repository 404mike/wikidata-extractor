He became a corn merchant of Gloucester and was an Alderman and mayor of the city four times. He was also a J.P.In 1873 Robinson stood in a by-election Gloucester after out manoeuvering former Liberal member John Joseph Powell for the candidature, but was defeated. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester in 1880 after the Liberals had established a party caucus chosen by ward meetings, resulting in improved organisation. However bribery and corruption were on a major scale in Gloucester and Robinson was unseated in the same year. His willingness to stand down and the unwillingness of the Conservatives to take matters further led to suspicions of collusion between the parties and a Royal Commission was set up to examine electoral practices. The Royal Commission concluded that Gloucester was among the most corrupt of the seven towns investigated and that bribery was endemic in all elections in the city. The Commission concluded that half of the electorate had taken bribes in 1880, and blamed local politicians for most of the corruption. Notwithstanding this, and the virtual halving of the electorate eligible to vote, Robinson was reelected for Gloucester in 1885 when representation had been reduced to one member under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.He was knighted in Queen Victoria's 1894 Birthday Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Robinson"]}, {"page": "Gloucester (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas RobinsonOn petition, Robinson's election was declared void, the writ was suspended and a Royal Commission appointed to investigate", "| Thomas Robinson"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Sir Thomas Robinson, corn merchant and Liberal MP 1880\u201381 & 1885\u201395."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Robinson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Robinson"]}, {"page": "Thomas Robinson", "response": ["* Thomas Robinson (composer) (c. 1560 \u2013 after 1609), English composer and music teacher", "* Thomas Robinson, 1st Baron Grantham (c. 1695\u20131770), English diplomatist and politician", "* Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham (1738\u20131786), English politician and statesman", "* Thomas Robinson Jr. (1800\u20131843), United States Representative from Delaware", "* Thomas Robinson (Gloucester MP) (1827\u20131897), English corn merchant and Liberal politician, MP for Gloucester 1880\u201395", "* Sir Thomas Robinson (Stretford MP) (1864\u20131953), English politician, MP for Stretford, 1918\u20131931", "* Thomas Robinson (Northern Ireland politician) (born 1950 or 1951), Unionist politician from Northern Ireland", "* Thomas Robinson (cricketer) (1837\u20131910), English cricketer", "* Thomas Robinson (footballer) (1893\u20131951), English footballer", "* Thomas Robinson (basketball) (born 1991), basketball player", "* Sir Thomas Robinson, 1st Baronet (1703\u20131777), English architect and collector; Governor of Barbados, 1742\u20131747", "* Thomas Robinson (1749\u20131813), English cleric in Leicester", "* Thomas Robinson (orientalist) (1790\u20131873), English cleric and academic", "* Thomas Robinson (Medal of Honor) (1837\u20131915), United States Navy sailor"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Robinson"]}, {"page": "Elisha Smith Robinson", "response": ["Thomas Robinson (1827-1897) an English corn merchant and Liberal politician, cousin."]}, {"page": "List of UK Parliamentary election petitions", "response": ["| 1880 || Gloucester || Edmund Digby Worsley, James Franklin, and George Twyford || Thomas Robinson and Charles James Monk || Bribery, etc. || Void election(Robinson only) || Robinson gave notice before the trial that he would not defend the petition.
