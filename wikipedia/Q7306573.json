His first win came against Peterborough but Birmingham suffered a 5\u20130 home defeat against Barnsley in September. During the January 2013 transfer window, Clark sold Jake Jervis, David Lucas and Jack Butland, who returned on loan for the remainder of the season. Clark struggled to get Birmingham out of the bottom half of the league until back to back wins against Derby County and Middlesbrough took them up to 12th place in March. Despite receiving criticism from fans for alleged poor management skills regarding public fallouts with Nikola Zigic, Clark has been praised for introducing academy players into the first team squad, players including Jack Butland, Will Packwood, Mitch Hancox, Callum Reilly, Koby Arthur and Reece Hales. Clark continued the start of 2013 with his team producing good form, including a 4\u20130 away win at Crystal Palace and back to back 1\u20130 wins against Bristol City and Leeds. After finishing the season in 12th place, 7 points off the play-offs, Clark made his first signings for the 2013\u201314 Championship season with Darren Randolph, Andrew Shinnie and Lee Novak all signing on free transfers, whilst Olly Lee's loan was made permanent. The 2013\u201314 season started poorly again for Clark, with Birmingham winning a single game in the league against Yeovil Town as the Blues made their worst start to a league season for 25 years. Despite poor results in the league (including an 18 home match run without a league win) and the removal from the coaching staff of Clark's right hand men Derek Fazackerley and Terry McDermott, Clark managed to keep Birmingham City in the Championship with an injury time equaliser from Paul Caddis in the final game of the 2013\u201314 season against Bolton, the 2\u20132 result being enough to keep the team up on goal difference."]}, {"page": "1995 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 12 February \u2013 Reece Hales, footballer "]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["Birmingham entered the FA Cup in the third round, together with all other clubs in the top two divisions. Drawn away to fellow Championship side Leeds United, they prepared for the match by giving squad numbers to several youth players. Colin Doyle made his second appearance of the season in goal, and, with all senior strikers missing through injury or suspension, Ravel Morrison and Nathan Redmond played up front. Morrison's running put pressure on the Leeds defence, who were punished when Wade Elliott ran from deep before unleashing a \"stunning long-range shot\" to take the lead. After Birmingham failed to take advantage of their first-half superiority, Curtis Davies was robbed of the ball, leading to Luciano Becchio's equaliser on the hour. Shortly afterwards, Will Packwood broke his left tibia and fibula when landing awkwardly from an apparently innocuous aerial collision with Becchio. The 17-year-old Reece Hales made a late debut, and the game finished 1\u20131. Butland was left out of the team for the replay, to avoiding his becoming cup-tied and jeopardising a potential sale, and Becchio was absent ill. On a cold night, in front of only 7,400 home fans, Elliott gave Birmingham a first-half lead. Ross McCormack tied the scores in the second half, and six minutes later, the referee adjudged Paul Robinson to have handled the ball inside the penalty area, and El Hadji Diouf scored with a chipped penalty.", "!scope=\"row\"|Reece Hales"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 June 2014 || Reece Hales || Released || (Kidderminster Harriers)", "| style=\"text-align: center\"|\"Exclusive: Young duo Jake Green and Reece Hales sign one-year contracts to join Harriers\" .

He was named among the substitutes for Birmingham's Championship defeat away to Queens Park Rangers in September, ahead of the likes of Scott Allan and Matt Green, and according to manager Lee Clark, \"he was very close to getting on the pitch\". He did get on the pitch in the next match, away to Burnley on 17 September, replacing Darren Ambrose in the 51st minute, just after Birmingham went 2\u20130 down; the match ended 3\u20130.
