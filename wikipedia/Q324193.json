Between 1885 and 1897 he toured Europe as a soloist and ventured as far afield as the United States.  Besides five operas and eight symphonies his output also included: concertos for piano (4), violin (4), cello (2), viola, and harp; a triple concerto for violin, cello, and piano; chamber music; a requiem; and numerous lieder. Mo\u00f3r's opuses total to 151 to his credit including eight symphonies. He died, aged 68, in Chardonne, Switzerland.\nHis best-known invention was the Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r Pianoforte, which consisted of two keyboards lying one above each other and allowed, by means of a tracking device, one hand to play a spread of two octaves. The double keyboard pianoforte was promoted extensively in concerts throughout Europe and the United States by Mo\u00f3r's second wife, the British pianist Winifred Christie.\nIn 1921, Marie Tutundjian [de Vartavan] (born de Jarowslawska, 18.05.1887-20.11.1963) took a large part in the experiments with the Duplex-Coupler piano imagined by Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r. Marie was a very talented pianist who had been playing in public since the age of twelve and had even had the privilege of playing in duet with Paderewski Ignacy Jan Paderewski. She was married to the Armenian WWI hero and writer Levon Tutundjian [de Vartavan] and lived in Lausanne with him in Cornette de Bise. She taught at the Ribeaupierre Institute, a higher music school in Lausanne founded in 1915 by Mathilde and \u00c9mile de Ribeaupierre. The same year Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r sparked a lively controversy in the world of music by presenting two revolutionary inventions in quick succession. First, \"a giant violin, one and a half meters long, with five to six strings to reach the length of the cello, the bow being moved by a pedal\". The possibility of his employment in the orchestra prompted ironic comments from a critic of the Lausanne Gazette. Marie, for her part, worked with Moor's wife, Winifred Christie, to operate the second invention, a piano with two keyboards, the lower keyboard of which has its raised white keys to allow chromatic glissando and a pedal intermediate coupling the two keyboards - not to mention an ingenious system which made it possible to imitate a harpsichord. Marie Tutundjian played with it on 03-11-1921 at the Palace of Montreux and at least once again on 16-11-1921 [La Musique dans le Canton de Vaud (1904-1938), p. 146. See pages 251, 252 on Marie Tutundjian/de Jarowslawska], but these trials, if they left a trace in music history were not repeated [Encyclop\u00e9die de la musique, 2e partie, vol. 3, p. 2080-2081].\nOn a scholarship from Winnifred Christie Mo\u00f3r Timothy Baxter, then a student (later a professor) at The Royal Academy of Music, in 1964 wrote Six bagatelles for double Keyboard. The work was performed by Jeffery Harris on the 24nd of August 1976 in the Three Choirs Festival in Hereford plus BBC broadcast about the same time. Jeffery Harris held the Winnifred Christie Mo\u00f3r Scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music before Timothy Baxter. The scholarship stopped, when Winnifred Christie died after an accident in her home. Timothy Baxter has also written some arrangements for the instrument because of its interesting possibilities. The Six Bagatelles were later arranged for two pianos with a first performance in Arcueille during Festival Erik Satie on the 17th of May 2013, the birthday of Erik Satie, played by Elsa Sorvari and Viktor Bogino. They also in 2013 played the work twice more, one of them in Paris. The Bagatelles have since been played a number of times in Denmark. They are published by Edition-S.dk and can be found on Timothy Baxter's portrait CD from 2015 played by the pianists Anne Mette St\u00e6hr and Ulrich St\u00e6rk.\nMaurice Ravel said that the Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r Pianoforte produced the sounds he had really intended in some of his works, if only it had been possible to write them for two hands playing on a standard piano. Anatoly Brandukov, dedicatee of Mo\u00f3r's Cello Sonata, No. 2 in G Major, Op. 55, introduced the composer to Pablo Casals. Casal's first meeting is recorded in nearly every biography about Casals. In his own words Casals said, \u201cHis music was overwhelming\u2026.and the more he played, the more convinced I became that he was a composer of the highest order. When he stopped, I said simply, \u2018You are a genius.\u2019\u201d This meeting was the beginning of a long friendship between the two with Casals performing and premiering Mo\u00f3r's compositions, several of which were dedicated to Casals. For example, Casals gave four performances of the Cello Sonata No. 2 in G Major in December 1905 alone following his initial meeting with the composer earlier in the year. Casals's first noted performance of this sonata came during a Russian tour (pianist not noted) followed by two performances with Marie Panth\u00e8s in Geneva and Lausanne and one performance in Paris with Alfred Cortot at the piano.  Casals also championed other of Mo\u00f3r's works, performing multiple sonatas, a concerto that Mo\u00f3r dedicated to him, a double cello concerto, and a triple concerto for piano trio with orchestra.\nMo\u00f3r and Christie also collaborated on a book of technical exercises for the instrument.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Moor", "response": ["* Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r (1863\u20131931), Hungarian composer"]}, {"page": "Piano", "response": ["thumb|Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r Pianoforte", "A rare variant of the piano called the Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r Pianoforte has double keyboards, one lying above the other. It was invented by Hungarian composer and pianist, Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r (19 February 1863\u00a0\u2013 20 October 1931). The lower keyboard has the usual 88 keys, whilst the upper keyboard has 76 keys. When the upper keyboard is played, an internal mechanism pulls down the corresponding key on the lower keyboard, but an octave higher. This lets a pianist reach two octaves with one hand, impossible on a conventional piano. Due to its double keyboard, musical works that were originally created for double-manual harpsichord, such as the Goldberg Variations by Bach, become much easier to play, since playing on a conventional single keyboard piano involves complex and hand-tangling cross-hand movements. The design also features a special fourth pedal that couples the lower and upper keyboard, so when playing on the lower keyboard the note one octave higher also plays. Only about 60 Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r Pianofortes were made, mostly by B\u00f6sendorfer. Other piano manufacturers, such as Bechstein, Chickering, and Steinway & Sons, also manufactured a few."]}, {"page": "1931 in music", "response": ["*October 20 \u2013 Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r, pianist, composer and inventor of the Duplex-Coupler Grand Pianoforte (born 1863)"]}, {"page": "1863 in music", "response": ["*February 19 \u2013 Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r, composer (died 1931)"]}, {"page": "List of string quartet composers", "response": ["*Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r (1863\u20131931): Two string quartets, Op. 59 in A and Op. 87, and other works for string quartet"]}, {"page": "List of compositions for cello and orchestra", "response": ["*Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r"]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists", "response": ["* Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r"]}, {"page": "Emanuel Mo\u00f3r", "response": ["#REDIRECT Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r"]}, {"page": "Emanuel Moor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r"]}, {"page": "List of symphony composers", "response": ["*Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r (1863\u20131931), Hungarian composer of 8 symphonies"]}, {"page": "List of triple concertos for violin, cello, and piano", "response": ["*Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Science and technology in Hungary", "response": ["Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3rStub"]}, {"page": "List of symphonies in E minor", "response": ["|Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r"]}, {"page": "List of 20th-century classical composers", "response": ["| Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r || 1863 || 1931 || Hungarian || ||"]}, {"page": "Pleyel et Cie", "response": ["The company's success led them to invest in experiments, resulting in the double piano in 1890, invented by Hungarian composer Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r.
