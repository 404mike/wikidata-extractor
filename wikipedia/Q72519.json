Stuart Burgess, Phillip E. Johnson, William A. Dembski, and Stephen C. Meyer are evangelical Protestants; Michael Behe is a Roman Catholic; Paul Nelson supports young Earth creationism; and Jonathan Wells is a member of the Unification Church.

Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments that are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of theistic creationism is a necessary first step for ultimately reintroducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design identified \"as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message.\" Johnson emphasizes that \"...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact.\""]}, {"page": "Michael Behe", "response": ["Behe says he once fully accepted the scientific theory of evolution, but that after reading Evolution: A Theory in Crisis (1985), by Michael Denton, he came to question evolution.Behe 2002b Later, Behe came to believe that there was evidence, at a biochemical level, that some biological systems were \"irreducibly complex\".

Johnson interviewed in November 2000. Johnson recounted that on sabbatical in England he sought, through prayer, inspiration for what he should do with the rest of his life, and then received an epiphany after he read Richard Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker (1986) and Michael Denton's Evolution: A Theory in Crisis (1985). Johnson later said, \"Something about the Darwinists' rhetorical style made me think they had something to hide.\" Despite having no formal background in biology, he felt that he could add insight into the premises and arguments.  Johnson stated that he approached the creation evolution dispute not as a scientist but as an academic lawyer by profession, with a specialty in analyzing the logic of arguments and identifying the assumptions that lie behind those arguments. He noted that what people think about evolutionism depends very heavily on the kind of logic they employ and the kind of assumptions they make.

Before Darwin, \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire argued that animals shared  homologous parts, and that if one was enlarged, the others would be reduced in compensation. After Darwin, D'Arcy Thompson hinted at vitalism and offered geometric explanations in his classic 1917 book On Growth and Form. Adolf Seilacher suggested mechanical inflation for \"pneu\" structures in Ediacaran biota fossils such as Dickinsonia. G\u00fcnter P. Wagner argued for developmental bias, structural constraints on embryonic development. Stuart Kauffman favoured self-organisation, the idea that complex structure emerges holistically and spontaneously from the dynamic interaction of all parts of an organism. Michael Denton argued for laws of form by which Platonic universals or \"Types\" are self-organised. Stephen J. Gould and Richard Lewontin proposed biological \"spandrels\", features created as a byproduct of the adaptation of nearby structures. Gerd B. M\u00fcller and Stuart A. Newman argued that the appearance in the fossil record of most of the current phyla in the Cambrian explosion was \"pre-Mendelian\" evolution caused by physical factors. Brian Goodwin, described by Wagner as part of \"a fringe movement in evolutionary biology\", denies that biological complexity can be reduced to natural selection, and argues that pattern formation is driven by morphogenetic fields.", "The biochemist Michael Denton has argued a structuralist case for self-organization. In a 2013 paper, he claimed that \"the basic forms of the natural world\u2014the Types\u2014are immanent in nature, and determined by a set of special natural biological laws, the so called 'laws of form'.\" He asserts that these \"recurring patterns and forms\" are \"genuine universals\". Form is in this view not shaped by natural selection, but by \"self-organizing properties of particular categories of matter\" and by \"cosmic fine-tuning of the laws of nature\".

The variation in the amino acid sequence of proteins such as cytochrome C can be analyzed to provide a phylogenetic tree that matches trees provided by other taxonomic evidence.

For example, the difference between the amino acid sequence for the cytochrome C of a carp and those of a frog, turtle, chicken, rabbit, and horse is a very constant 13% to 14%.
