His father, had become an agent of the South Australia Company in England and together with partners Frederick Luck (quarter share) and Roger Cunliffe (one-eighth share) paid \u00a34416 for a special survey of 4,416 acres (17.87 km2) in South Australia, and sent his eldest son (George) Francis Davenport to select the land. Francis and his second wife Sarah Davenport (n\u00e9e Fincher) arrived in Adelaide in February 1840 aboard Rajasthan. After initially considering land near Port Lincoln, he selected land on the upper reaches of the River Angas, including what is now the town of Macclesfield. Francis returned to England in 1841, leaving Henry Giles to manage his affairs.\nDavenport married Margaret Fraser Cleland (1821 \u2013 6 February 1902) on 1 June 1842. She would become known for her charitable work, closely associated with Emily Clark, Lady Colton and Catherine Helen Spence.\nSamuel, his wife and brother Robert (1816\u20131896) arrived in Adelaide from Hobart aboard Adelaide in February 1843. \nFrancis and Sarah returned to Adelaide aboard Rajusthan in February 1843. He died at the Rundle Street home of William Giles on 8 April 1843.\nThe remaining brothers lived at Macclesfield and managed the survey. Samuel continued to receive an annual allowance from his father.\nDavenport's first ventures in Australia were in mixed farming, almonds and vines, which had sparked his interest when he was in the south of France as a youth. He then tried sheep-farming with approximately 6000 sheep, but disease killed half of them. In 1860 he bought land near Port Augusta, and turned to ranching horses and cattle. He realised from his success that large-stock holdings made healthy profits in South Australia.\n\nFrom 1849 he lived mostly at his home in Beaumont, in his residence of Beaumont House, which he owned from 1851 onwards. He continued to care for the welfare of tenants at Macclesfield, providing attractive rental terms.\nBetween 5 May 1846 and 1 July 1848, Davenport was a non-official nominated member of the South Australian Legislative Council. \nBetween 1849 and 1852 he served as a city commissioner. He contested the Legislative Council seat of Hindmarsh without success in a by-election during 1854, but on 25 October 1855 was nominated to the part-elective Legislative Council. He was eventually elected to the first Legislative Council under responsible government in 1857 and administered the oath of allegiance to the councillors on 22 April 1857. He served a number of ministries; however he resigned from the council on 25 September 1866.Davenport strongly promoted agriculture and other new industries in South Australia. Between 1864 and 1872 he published a number of pamphlets, three of them dealing with the cultivation of olives and manufacture of olive oil, silk and tobacco. Davenport grew both olives and silk on his Beaumont House estate. He was a member of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society and its president from 1873 to 1879 and 1890 to 1891. He was a member of the South Australian Institute's Board of Governors.He was elected to a number of positions in the agricultural, horticultural and geographical societies, include the American Philosophical Society in 1876. He was also a successful banker like his English father.\nDavenport was knighted during 1884 and in 1886 appointed KCMG and given an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge. After his death in 1906, obituarists praised his 'honourable record both in public and private life' and both Houses of Parliament were adjourned for his funeral.\nThe South Australian Assembly seat of Davenport was later named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coopers Brewery", "response": ["On 13 May 1862, Thomas brewed his first recorded batch. He did all the work himself (purchasing, calling for orders, brewing, washing, filling, corking and wiring the bottles, delivering the finished product), possibly with the help of then 12-year-old son William, while continuing to attend the cows, run the dairy, and do the daily milk deliveries. Being unlicensed, in early June he sought \"professional advice on the sale of beer\" from a solicitor, which his ledger records as having cost 7s 6d. Towards the end of 1862 Thomas realised that to make a living as a brewer, he would need to increase his brewing capacity, so he mortgaged his property to Frederick Scarfe, the Mayor of Norwood, a butcher, and a customer of Thomas's ale, for \u00a3300, and built a new brewhouse. In January 1863 he sold his cows and the milk delivery run. Although with half-a-dozen breweries in Adelaide, there was a lot of competition, Thomas's ale was unique in that he used no sugar, \"consequently, ours being pure, the Doctors recommend it to their patients\".Letter from Thomas Cooper to his brother John, written in 1864. Although one of the smaller South Australian brewers, Thomas gained a reputation for quality. By 1867 he had over 120 customers, some quite notable (e.g. Samuel Davenport, John Barton Hack, George Hawker, Dr Penfold and the Lord Bishop of Adelaide, but he did not supply public houses, \"apparently because it was against his principles\".Painter (1998), pp. 9\u201317"]}, {"page": "Waterfall Gully, South Australia", "response": ["Other parts of the Waterfall Gully area were subdivided, though, and much of the area was owned by Samuel Davenport.

Along with farming, the hills and creek were prized areas for the sawyers and splitters, and a number of mines were established in the region from the mid-to-late 19th century. In 1844 the first silver-lead, manganese and iron mines were established in the area, while the 1890s saw a minor gold rush\u2014although \"only small quantities were extracted\".Warburton (1981), p. 193.
