He teaches in Birmingham.\nJones is also a dance music artist, regularly contributing to compilations and collections of Drum and Bass, House, and Trance music alongside artists such as DJ Luck and the Artful Dodger. It is Jones' work in new-age music that has gained the most recognition. He began recording for the New World Music label, in 1995 with Love Eternal. Fusing new age music ideas with dance music styles, Jones became one of the label's best-selling artists with 1998's album Lifeforce. His soft jazz release Late Into The Night, broadened his audience. Subsequent releases such as Lazy Days (featuring vocalist Sarah Jane) and Pure Calm, have established Jones as one of the genre's most innovative and progressive voices. Stuart Jones maintains a healthy performance schedule on a variety of circuits, making appearances in symphony halls and dancehalls alike.\nHe composed a classical symphony, Symphony in F, two stage musicals Shirt and Tie, and Picture This Picture Life, and finally a modern Concerto for acoustic speed funk pianos.\nJones is also noted for his TV music with KPM and Stock, the most notable appearance of his music being on the soap opera Emmerdale.Stuart Jones works mainly as a solo artist and appears on YouTube videos with his piano-duelling duo Blister, teaming up with musician Sniper, many of the videos being featured on NME.A Cambridge University PhD by Frances Ragni is based on his improvisations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lazy Day", "response": ["*Lazy Days, album by Stuart Jones (composer) 2000"]}, {"page": "Stuart Jones", "response": ["Stuart Jones may refer to:", "*Stuart Jones (cricketer) (1929\u20132015), New Zealand cricketer", "*Stuart Jones (cyclist) (born 1969), Australian Para cyclist", "*Stuart Jones (footballer, born 1977), English football goalkeeper", "*Stuart Jones (footballer, born 1984), Welsh football defender", "*Stuart Jones (golfer) (1925\u20132012), New Zealand golfer", "*Stuart Jones (rugby league) (born 1981), professional rugby league player for Castleford Tigers", "*Stuart Jones (historian), British historian", "*Stuart Jones (composer), British composer"]}, {"page": "Source: Music of the Avant Garde", "response": ["* Stuart Jones"]}]}}
