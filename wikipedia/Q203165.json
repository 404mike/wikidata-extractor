The other director, von Ellstein, may be modeled after Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg.  The James Lee Bartlow character may have been inspired by Paul Eliot Green, the University of North Carolina academic-turned-screenwriter of The Cabin in the Cotton. But Bartlow also resembles novelist William Faulkner, who worked on many of Hollywood\u2019s best movies\u2014and had an easier relationship with the industry than he did with his wife.
