Jim Hacker is now portrayed as heading a coalition government, while dealing with an economic downturn, his coalition partner having a leadership crisis, and Scottish independence. Like the stage play, on which it was broadly based, it is set at Chequers. Filming took place in September 2012. Both David Haig and Henry Goodman reprised their stage roles as Jim Hacker and Sir Humphrey. Haig's Hacker was rather manic,Notably, \"A Tsar is Born\", episode broadcast 19 February 2013 while Goodman's Sir Humphrey was more aloof and supercilious than Hawthorne's had been. The other main characters were Bernard Woolley (Chris Larkin, reprising his role from The Gielgud Theatre run at London's West End) and Claire Sutton (Zoe Telford), the latter with a more prominent role than Hacker's special advisor in the original series. Critical reaction was largely negative. Jay and Lynn revealed that they had offered the show first to the BBC, but that the corporation had asked for a pilot episode which the writers thought was unnecessary in the light of the earlier series. The revived series ended up being produced by the BBC for Gold.", "The play began a tour of the United Kingdom in February 2011, with Simon Williams as Sir Humphrey, Richard McCabe as Jim Hacker, Chris Larkin as Bernard and Charlotte Lucas as Claire Sutton. It returned to the West End in July 2011 for a 10-week run at the Apollo Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, with Williams and McCabe reprising their roles. The play then went back on a tour of the United Kingdom before returning to the West End with a revised script. Further rewrites took place before the 2012 UK tour and subsequent Trafalgar Studios run, the crucial change having replaced references from underage to multiple partner sex."]}, {"page": "2003 in film", "response": ["| Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World || 20th Century Fox / Miramax Films / Universal Pictures || Peter Weir (director/screenplay); John Collee (screenplay); Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Billy Boyd, James D'Arcy, Edward Woodall, Bryan Dick, Chris Larkin, Robert Pugh, Max Benitz, Max Pirkis, Jack Randall, Lee Ingleby, Richard Pates, Richard McCabe, Ian Mercer, Tony Dolan, David Threlfall, Joseph Morgan, George Innes, William Mannering, Patrick Gallagher, Alex Palmer, John DeSantis, Ousmane Thiam, Mark Lewis Jones, Thierry Segall || Adventure, Drama, Period || || Live Action"]}, {"page": "1996 in film", "response": ["| Angels & Insects || The Samuel Goldwyn Company || Philip Haas (director/screenplay); Belinda Haas (screenplay); Mark Rylance, Patsy Kensit, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jeremy Kemp, Douglas Henshall, Annette Badland, Chris Larkin, Anna Massey, Saskia Wickham, Lindsay Thomas, Michelle Sylvester, Clare Lovell, Jenny Lovell, Oona Haas, Angus Hodder, John Veasey || Romance, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World", "response": ["* Chris Larkin as Captain Howard, Royal Marines"]}, {"page": "Nigel Jones, Baron Jones of Cheltenham", "response": ["In Official Secrets, a 2019 British-American docudrama film, Jones is portrayed by Chris Larkin."]}, {"page": "List of show business families", "response": ["* Actor Sir Robert Stephens is the father of actors Chris Larkin and Toby Stephens through his third wife Dame Maggie Smith.
