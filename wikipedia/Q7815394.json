Nevertheless, injuries began to affect the first eleven, leaving room for reserves like Derek Mountford, Stan Smith, and Tom Conway to make an impression. The 'Steele Curtain' defence was still in operation, picking up five clean sheets in these eleven games. Journalist Bernard Jones compared 'the Vale Plan' to the Brazilian method of defence, defending the penalty area at all costs as that was from where 95% of all goals were scored. However manager Freddie Steele responded by claiming there was no such plan, and that the main objective was simply 'to beat the opposition'. On 22 October, Sheffield Wednesday went away from Vale Park with a 1\u20130 win, this was followed with a 4\u20131 defeat at Filbert Street. Steele began to initiate a modern pre-match ritual of having the players warm up in their tracksuits fifteen minutes before kick-off, though on 12 November this did them no favours at Ewood Park, as Blackburn Rovers romped to a 7\u20131 victory. Steele made eight changes following the defeat, which made little difference as Vale extended their run without a win to nine games. This left them in fifteenth place by mid-December, with a host of players out with injuries.", "On the financial side, a loss was made of \u00a34,974, blamed upon a 'crippling burden' of \u00a312,422 in entertainment tax. Home attendances were down by around 2,000 a game to 18,985, leaving gate receipts at \u00a360,784. Steele retained thirty professionals, releasing Albert Mullard and Ray Hancock (Northwich Victoria), and Tom Conway (Leek Town).", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Tom Conway", "|7||FW||||Tom Conway||4||0||4", "| Summer 1956 || FW ||  || Tom Conway || Leek Town || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Tom Conway (born 1933), played for Port Vale."]}, {"page": "Tom Conway (English footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Conway (footballer, born 1933)"]}]}}
