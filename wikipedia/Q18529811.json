It was demonstrated by Karl Friedrich Abel at his first public concert in London, on 5 April 1759, when it was described as \"newly invented\" . In the dedication to Walpole of his cello sonatas op. 3, the cellist/composer James Cervetto praised the pentachord, declaring: \"I know not a more fit Instrument to Accompany the Voice\" . Performances on the instrument are documented as late as 1783, after which it seems to have fallen out of use.

Conway (2012), pp. 71-2 In 1739/40, he settled in England and  became solo cellist at the Drury Lane Theatre, where the musician and music historian Charles Burney met him when he joined the theatre's orchestra in the season of 1744/45.

He played concertos, concertinas, continuo sonatas and chamber music; both solos and orchestral parts.", "During his prime, Crosdill made many sojourns to Paris where he was a favourite of Marie Antoinette. There he studied with and became close friends with the Duport brothers, Jean-Pierre Duport (1741\u20131818), and Jean-Louis Duport (1749\u20131819).  He was member of Giovanni Batista Viotti's (1755\u20131825) orchestra for the Concert de la Loge Olympique in 1780. Crosdill returned to England permanently in 1785.  That year he spent the Spring concert season performing in the Pantheon Series and organised competition with Hanover Square Series for which James Cervetto (1747\u20131837) played. The Pantheon series included numerous performances by the Maras; vocalist Gertrud Elisabeth Mara and her husband violoncellist Johann Baptist Mara (1744\u20131808). It was through his association with the Maras that Crosdill met Haydn in 1791 and purchased the \"Mara\" Stradivari in 1802.
