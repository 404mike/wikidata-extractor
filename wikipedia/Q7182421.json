Since making his debut for the club, he established himself as number one ahead of John Sullivan and Phil Smith. Carson set himself up to be signed up permanently in January 2014, when he outlined that he was keen to stay at the South Coast club. Carson helped Portsmouth keep two consecutive clean sheets between 26 December 2013 and 29 December 2013 against Dagenham & Redbridge and Northampton Town. Shortly, he had his loan spell with the club extended until the end of the season. Carson, once again, helped Portsmouth keep four consecutive clean sheets between 25 February 2014 and 11 March 2014. Having previously did not play against his parent club, Bury, Carson eventually started in goal against the club, as Portsmouth drew 4\u20134 on 26 April 2014.

He made his third first-team appearance in a first round FA Cup match against Notts County, on 3 November.

On 20 November 2012, first-choice goalkeeper Andersen made his last appearance for Portsmouth in a 2\u20133 defeat to Leyton Orient before returning to Premier League club Reading, making Eastwood the only goalkeeper at Portsmouth, and securing his first-team place. Just after Andersen's departure, former Swindon Town goalkeeper Phil Smith was signed, initially as back-up for Eastwood. Eastwood's position was under threat, when former Portsmouth goalkeeper Alan Knight (famous for the most appearances for a Portsmouth player) came in as goalkeeper coach (after the departure of John Keeley). Knight backed Eastwood, and on 2 March 2013 Pompey won their first match in over four months (23 matches), a 2\u20131 win at Crewe Alexandra, Eastwood's first win as a Portsmouth player. In the next month he kept three clean sheets in six matches, against Bury, Preston North End and Tranmere Rovers. Following Portsmouth's relegation, Eastwood said he was determined to stay at the club for the next season.

The home side dominated the first half but it ended goalless.  Early in the second half, Charlton's Nicky Bailey saw his curling shot hit the inside of a Swindon goalpost.  Charlie Austin put Swindon ahead on 52 minutes with a header from Alan Sheehan's cross.  Eight minutes later, Simon Ferry and Darren Ward had a two-on-one with Darren Randolph after a quick break and Ward scored with a low shot to make it 2\u20130.  Deon Burton headed past David Lucas in the Swindon goal in the 65th minute following a long pass from Randolph to halve the deficit; the match ended 2\u20131.  The second leg of the semi-final was played three days later at the Valley in Charlton.  Within five minutes of the start, Lucas was forced off with a shoulder injury and was replaced by Phil Smith. Charlton controlled the first half and went ahead with an own goal from Ferry in the 27th minute.  In stoppage time, the home side doubled their lead with a  strike from Dave Mooney.  Midway through the second half, Gordon Greer was sent off for Swindon after a high challenge on Burton, but on 74 minutes Ward scored to level the tie on aggregate.  Miguel Llera was then sent off for Charlton after dragging down Austin and the game went into extra time.  With no further goals in the additional 30 minutes, the tie went to a penalty shootout.
