Towards the end of the first period of extra time, a mishit pass from Len Shackleton fell to Ray Wright, playing Eric Bryant through on goal, who found the net to put Yeovil back into the lead. With 15 minutes remaining to hold onto their lead, Yeovil were now on the back foot, with the superior fitness of Sunderland's professional players beginning to tell. Three minutes from time, the referee blew for a free kick to Sunderland. The Yeovil supporters, thinking the whistle had been blown for full-time, prematurely invaded the pitch in celebration, threatening to abandon the game once more. Order was eventually restored, allowing the final minutes of the game to be played.", "| FW || 10 || Ray Wright"]}]}}
