On August 7, 2019, Barnes & Noble became a privately held, wholly owned subsidiary of Elliott."]}, {"page": "Waterstones", "response": ["Established in 1982 by Tim Waterstone, after whom the company was named, the bookseller expanded rapidly until being sold in 1993 to WHSmith. In 1998, Waterstones was bought by a consortium of Waterstone, EMI & Advent International. The company was taken under the umbrella of HMV Group, which later merged the Dillons and Ottakar's brands into the company. Following several poor sets of results for the group, HMV put the chain up for sale. In May 2011, it was announced that A&NN Capital Fund Management, owned by Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut, had bought the chain for \u00a353.5m and appointed James Daunt as managing director. The company is incorporated in England & Wales as Waterstones Booksellers Ltd, with its registered office at 203\u2013206 Piccadilly, London (which is also the location of its flagship shop). As well as the Waterstones brand, the company owns the London bookseller Hatchards, Irish shop Hodges Figgis, and reached an agreement to purchase Foyles in 2018. In April 2018, hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation bought a majority stake in the company.", "===Alexander Mamut & James Daunt: 2011\u2013present===", "In May 2011 HMV Group announced the sale of Waterstones to A&NN Capital Fund Management, a fund controlled by Russian businessman Alexander Mamut for \u00a353 million. The takeover was welcomed by publishers as \"a step forward to re-establishing a proper physical presence\". On 29 June 2011, the sale of Waterstones was completed and approved by the vast majority of shareholders at an emergency general meeting. Mamut appointed James Daunt, founder of Daunt Books, as managing director and a board of directors was announced in October 2011 including Miranda Curtis as chairman. In September 2011, the bookseller announced that it intended to drop its 3-for-2 deal on books after a decade. The offer was replaced with a 'bespoke offer', based on branches choosing their own pricing structures from available discounts.", "In January 2012, the company announced that it would be moving away from the branding developed in 2010 by agency VentureThree, and reverting to its original logo. This involved the removal of the apostrophe from its name, saying it would be \"a more versatile and practical spelling\". This decision received media coverage, in which the company was subject to criticism. John Richards, of the Apostrophe Protection Society, said that the change was \"just plain wrong\" and \"grammatically incorrect\" while the move sparked outrage on Twitter, involving debate on whether the move was grammatically incorrect or not. James Daunt expressed that \"Waterstones without an apostrophe is, in a digital world of URLs and email addresses, a more versatile and practical spelling\". Linguist David Crystal on his blog added: \"\u00a0... if Waterstone's wants to become Waterstones, that's up to the firm. It's nothing to do with expressing possession or plurality or anything to do with meaning.\"", "Following a decision in late-2011 to scrap an e-reading offer in-branch, it was announced in May 2012 that Waterstones would be selling the Amazon Kindle across its estate. James Daunt launched the new agreement with Amazon stating that Waterstones would be offering \"e-reading services and offer Kindle digital devices\" throughout the company's branches and on its website, with an intention to \"make the Kindle experience better\". This announcement was received with surprise across the book industry as it had been suggested that Waterstones was developing a partnership with Barnes & Noble to launch the Nook in the UK, or that the company was developing its own device, but Daunt \"ultimately rejected\" other avenues as Waterstones \"would have been out of the market\" before their implementation.", "In September 2018, Waterstones confirmed it would buy 115-year-old Foyles, with seven stores whilst retaining the brand. James Daunt said the purchase would help \"to protect and champion the pleasures of real bookshops in the face of Amazon's siren call\".", "Tim Waterstone and James Daunt have been critical of tax avoidance by Amazon.com in the British press. Amazon has received sustained scrutiny for the amount of its overall sales that are reported by its UK subsidiary, in comparison to those 'processed offshore in Luxembourg to avoid UK tax'. In the 2012\u201313 financial year, Amazon paid \u00a33.2 million in tax on sales of \u00a34.2 billion and received \u00a32.5 million in grants from the government. In the same period, it was revealed that Waterstones paid \u00a311.9 million in tax, despite an operating loss of \u00a325.4 million and sales of \u00a3410.4 million.", "Non-branded Waterstones became an issue again in 2016 at a national level, following newspaper reports about not only Southwold Books but two further shops, The Rye Bookshop in Sussex and Harpenden Books in Hertfordshire, being opened and local residents not realising the connection with the retailer. Commentators were split on the ethics of the decision to open unbranded shops, but it was noted that at no point had attempts been made to hide the connection to the retailer. In interviews, James Daunt denied any \"subterfuge\" and said he wanted for the shops to behave as independent retailers do and have their own identity. He further stated that more unbranded shops were likely to open in the future.", ", Waterstones does not pay the \"real living wage\", as recommended by the Living Wage Foundation, and a rate significantly higher than the official National Living Wage. More than 1,300 writers backed a campaign to ask Waterstones to pay the \"real living wage\". In response Waterstone managing director James Daunt said the company was \"simply not profitable enough\" and that \"there's a long gap between wanting to do something and it being remotely sensible\". Waterstones said that only Ikea, Majestic and Lush of other similar large retailers pay the \"real living wage\"."]}, {"page": "Daunt Books", "response": ["Daunt Books is a chain of bookshops in London, founded by James Daunt.

The older section of the Marylebone shop was completed in 1912, and was originally an antiquarian bookshop called Francis Edwards. It is alleged to be the first custom-built bookshop in the world. A large, walk-in safe is visible near the entrance to the travel gallery, and is where expensive volumes were once stored.
