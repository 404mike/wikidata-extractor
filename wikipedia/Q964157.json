However, as the Roman Road course was a par-69, rare at the professional level, his scores relative to par were a slightly less remarkable 14-under after two rounds and 18-under after three. Karlsson shot two-over-par for the final round, but still won. In the same year, Phillip Archer scored 60 in the first round, missing a birdie putt on the 18th green."]}, {"page": "Omega European Masters", "response": ["| 2007 || EUR ||  Brett Rumford || align=center|268 || align=center|\u221216 || Playoff ||  Phillip Archer ||"]}, {"page": "German Masters (golf)", "response": ["| 2007 ||  S\u00f8ren Hansen || align=center|271 || align=center|\u221217 || 4 strokes ||  Phillip Archer Alastair Forsyth"]}, {"page": "S\u00f8ren Hansen", "response": ["| Phillip Archer,  Alastair Forsyth"]}, {"page": "Brett Rumford", "response": ["| Phillip Archer", "| Phillip Archer"]}, {"page": "Michael Jonzon", "response": ["| Phillip Archer,  Chris Hanell, David Ryles"]}, {"page": "Open de Andaluc\u00eda", "response": ["| 2007 ||  Lee Westwood || align=center|268 || align=center|\u221220 || 2 strokes ||  Fredrik Andersson Hed Phillip Archer || Aloha Golf Club"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain and Ireland Seve Trophy golfers", "response": ["|  || Phillip Archer || 2007"]}, {"page": "2006 U.S. Open (golf)", "response": ["*England: Phillip Archer, Richard Green, Maarten Lafeber, Graeme McDowell, Jyoti Randhawa, Jeev Milkha Singh, Graeme Storm, Oliver Wilson"]}, {"page": "Rolex Trophy", "response": ["| 2004 ||  Phillip Archer || align=center|198 || align=center|\u221218 || 5 strokes ||  Lee Slattery"]}, {"page": "Open de Bretagne", "response": ["| 2011 || CHA ||  Phillip Archer || align=center|273 || align=center|\u22127 || 1 stroke ||  Roland Steiner"]}, {"page": "2007 Seve Trophy", "response": ["|Phillip Archer", "|Phillip Archer"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Phillip Archer||1972\u2013"]}, {"page": "2008 U.S. Open (golf)", "response": ["*England: Phillip Archer, Robert Dinwiddie, Johan Edfors, Ross Fisher, Alastair Forsyth, Thomas Levet, Ross McGowan"]}, {"page": "2008 Open Championship", "response": [":Europe: Thomas Aiken, Phillip Archer, Peter Baker, Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy, Ariel Ca\u00f1ete, Simon Dyson, Pelle Edberg, Johan Edfors, Ross Fisher, Jean-Baptiste Gonnet, David Horsey, Jos\u00e9-Filipe Lima, Alex Nor\u00e9n, Simon Wakefield, Anthony Wall, Paul Waring, Steve Webster, Martin Wiegele"]}, {"page": "Johan Axgren", "response": ["| Phillip Archer,  Roope Kakko (a)"]}, {"page": "2010 Open Championship", "response": [":Ladybank: Phillip Archer, Simon Edwards, Tyrrell Hatton (a)"]}, {"page": "Finnish Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2004 || CHA ||  Roope Kakko (a) || align=center|202 || align=center|\u221211 || Playoff ||  Phillip Archer Johan Axgren"]}, {"page": "2004 Challenge Tour", "response": ["| 22 Aug || Rolex Trophy || Switzerland ||  Phillip Archer (1) || ", "|align=center|8 || Phillip Archer || || align=center|65,606"]}, {"page": "2009 European Tour Qualifying School graduates", "response": ["|T12|| Phillip Archer||186||109|| 1 Challenge Tour win", "| align=left|  Phillip Archer || 24 || 7 ||  || 151 || 99,211"]}, {"page": "2011 Challenge Tour", "response": ["| Phillip Archer (2)"]}, {"page": "Roope Kakko", "response": ["| Phillip Archer,  Johan Axgren", "| Phillip Archer,  Johan Axgren"]}, {"page": "2012 Challenge Tour", "response": ["| Phillip Archer (3)"]}, {"page": "Pacific Rubiales Colombia Classic", "response": ["| 2012 ||  Phillip Archer || align=center|280 || align=center|\u22128 || 1 stroke ||  Chris Lloyd Morten \u00d8rum Madsen"]}, {"page": "Leeds Cup", "response": ["*2016 Phillip Archer", "*2021 Phillip Archer"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain and Ireland PGA Cup golfers", "response": ["| Phillip Archer || 2017"]}]}}
