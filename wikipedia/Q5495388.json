On his return from injury, he started to score more freely and by Christmas he had scored seven goals. In his next game he doubled his tally for the season as he scored a club record seven goals in a match against Northampton Town at The Dell on 28 December 1901. His first goal came almost straight from the kick-off and within five minutes he had completed his hat trick. By half time Saints were 7\u20130 up, with Brown contributing four.

He formed a great partnership with Fred Harrison and together they scored 40 goals in the season. As Shea's stock continued to rise, other clubs could not fail to notice the qualities of the skilful ball player and prolific scorer, and he was described by one football writer as having an \"uncanny ability to pass to himself\". He transferred to Blackburn Rovers halfway through the 1912\u201313 season for a then-record fee of \u00a32000.

Radford made his debut in the opening match of the 1906\u201307 season, playing at centre-forward; after the team picked up only one point from the first three matches, Radford moved to outside-right, with Fred Harrison moving into the centre. This had little effect on the team's performances, and Radford lost his place to Frank Jefferis. Radford was recalled at the end of the season, initially replacing George Harris at inside-left, before three games back at centre-forward. In the first of these, away to Northampton Town on 6 April, Radford scored his only goals for the Saints in a 4\u20132 victory.

Tomlinson also appeared in all five FA Cup matches, the first of which came against local rivals, Portsmouth, on 13 January when Tomlinson and Fred Harrison combined on the right-wing to great effect, giving the Portsmouth left-back, George Molyneux, a torrid time with Tomlinson setting up Harrison's second goal with a \"perfect centre\" and scoring the fifth \"with a clinking drive\".

For the next match, Glen switched to inside-right, where he soon formed a strong partnership with Frank Jefferis on the right side of the Saints attack, with Fred Harrison in the centre. Although Harrison was to finish the season as top-scorer with 12 league goals, Glen contributed 10, including two in a 5\u20131 defeat of Millwall on 6 October 1906.

The match, which was played on a \"slippery\" pitch, attracted a \"very small\" crowd to see the return of Jack Farrell (who had been at the centre of the dispute over the players' poor performance in the 1900 FA Cup Final). The fans who stayed away missed a match in which several records were set, which still stand over 100 years later. Albert Brown kicked off with a pass to the wings and immediately ran into the Northampton goal where he received a return pass that he shot into the net past Northampton's goalkeeper, Fred Cook. Although the goal was not timed, this is believed to be the fastest goal scored by a Southampton player from the kick-off. Within five minutes, Brown had scored a hat trick before Archie Turner added a fourth goal with an \"excellently timed\" shot from the right. The Northampton defenders were floundering in the mud, with one turning a long shot from Samuel Meston into his own net before Brown ran through the defence to add a sixth goal. The seventh goal came from Fred Harrison following up after his original shot had been only partially cleared.
