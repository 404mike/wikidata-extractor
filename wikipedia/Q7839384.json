He also made six FA Cup appearances with two goals against Port Vale in the Third Round on 7 January 1989. Under manager Dave Stringer, he was a member of the Canaries' 1988\u201389 side that finished fourth in the top flight and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup.

However, the next season wasn't as happy as an ill-equipped Middlesbrough side were relegated from the Premier League. The following summer Falconer was sold to Sheffield United for \u00a3400,000."]}, {"page": "Ipswich Town F.C.
