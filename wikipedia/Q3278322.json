Beriosova, at 5'8\", was the same height as Nureyev, and would have been far taller en pointe, so Margot Fonteyn, who had left the stage, returned to be his partner. The performances were received rapturously and earned glowing reviews, but it was expected that Fonteyn would only dance for a year or two, and Beriosova retained international popularity and a \"huge following of fans\". However, in the years that followed, it became clear that Beriosova would not achieve the premier status widely considered to have been her destiny; by 1966, Fonteyn's firmly-established dominance and the lack of opportunity this afforded Beriosova coupled with the disintegration of her marriage led to the beginning of Beriosova's \"precipitous\" \"downward spiral\", although she continued to dance in major productions for some time. Plagued by illness, injuries, and worsening alcoholism, Beriosova performed very little in the 1970s. In the spring of 1971, a disastrous performance in the role of the tsarina in Anastasia at Covent Garden ended in Beriosova's drunken collapse whilst en pointe on stage, and she was carried off; her contract was terminated and her career with the Royal Ballet was over. She retired in 1975 but continued to coach young dancers. On her retirement from dancing, she became a popular teacher and dancers' coach, working in public onstage in Maina Gielgud's Steps, Notes and Squeaks in 1978 and 1980."]}, {"page": "Cape Town City Ballet", "response": ["* Maina Gielgud"]}, {"page": "Eduard Greyling", "response": ["Greyling returned to South Africa in August 1975 and rejoined CAPAB Ballet as its principal male dancer.
