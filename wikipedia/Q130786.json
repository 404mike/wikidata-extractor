He writes in Russian with a number of his books translated into English, including his semi-autobiographical The Liberators (1981). In the USSR, according to Suvorov and according to an interview with the former head of the GRU, he was sentenced to death in absentia.In his military history books, he offers an alternative view of the role of the USSR in World War II; the first and most well-known book on this topic being Icebreaker: Who started the Second World War?. The proposed concept and the methods of its substantiation have caused numerous discussions and criticism in historical and social circles. In Icebreaker, M Day and several follow-up books Suvorov argued that Joseph Stalin planned to use Nazi Germany as a proxy (the \u201cIcebreaker\u201d) against the West. The books are based on his personal analysis of Soviet military investments, diplomatic maneuvers, Politburo speeches and other circumstantial evidence.\nSuvorov also wrote a number of fiction books about the Soviet Army, military intelligence and the pre-war history of the USSR.

This view had also been advanced by former German generals following the war.

Margolis stated:Buchanan's heretical view, and mine, is that the Western democracies should have let Hitler expand his Reich eastward until it inevitably went to war with the even more dangerous Soviet Union. Once these despotisms had exhausted themselves, the Western democracies would have been left dominating Europe. The lives of millions of Western civilians and soldiers would have been spared. In a 2009 essay entitled \"Don't Blame Hitler Alone for World War II\", Margolis endorsed the claims of Viktor Suvorov that Operation Barbarossa was a \"preventive war\" forced on Hitler by an alleged impending Soviet attack, and that it is wrong to give Hitler \"total blame\" for World War II."]}, {"page": "Ivan Serov", "response": ["Viktor Suvorov claims that in 1946, Serov personally took part in the execution of Andrey Vlasov, along with the rest of the command of the Russian Liberation Army, an organization that had co-operated with the Nazis in World War II.", "* Viktor Suvorov, \"Inside Soviet Military Intelligence\" (1984), "]}, {"page": "HIV trial in Libya", "response": ["Cold War era GRU defector Viktor Suvorov would claim on Radio Free Europe that the conspiracy theory espoused by Gaddafi about CIA creating HIV and letting it loose in Africa had been invented by the KGB and was still promoted by Russian secret services, who were controlling Libya."]}, {"page": "April 9 tragedy", "response": ["The Soviet detachment, armed with military batons and spades (a favorite weapon of Soviet special forcesViktor Suvorov Spetsnaz, 1987, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, ), advanced on demonstrators moving along the Rustaveli Avenue.

The reason for that is in the Soviet military doctrine. With the reform of 1935 it was established that in case of a war the peacetime military districts on the border would split upon mobilisation each into a Front Command (taking control of the district's peacetime military formations) and a Military District Command (which stayed behind with the mission to mobilise the reserve formations and put them at the disposal of the Fronts as replacement troops). In that sense the Air Armies were under Air Force command in peacetime, but under the command of the Frontal HQs in wartime and the Fronts were commanded by Ground Forces generals. The entire front might report either to the Stavka or to a theatre of military operations (TVD). A Front was mobilised for a specific operation, after which it could be reformed and tasked with another operation (including a change of the Front's designation) or it could be disbanded with its formations dispersed among the other active Fronts and its HQ reintegrated into its original Military District HQ."]}, {"page": "The Liberators (Suvorov book)", "response": ["The Liberators: My Life in the Soviet Army (1981) by Viktor Suvorov (original Russian title:  \u041e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c) is a non-fiction, personal account of the Soviet Army during the 1960s and 1970s.
