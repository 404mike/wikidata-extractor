This attracted attention from Leicester Fosse from the Midland League who signed him in September 1891.\nAfter one goal in eight games, he moved to Rotherham Town. He scored in a record 11\u22120 defeat of Leicester in April 1892, where Leicester were disadvantaged by having to play with only ten men as a player didn't turn up. He later played for Derby Town.", "link_mentions": {}}}
