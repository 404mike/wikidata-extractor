He joined fellow students in forming a band (including Rodney Slater, Roger Ruskin Spear and Neil Innes, who was studying art at Goldsmiths College). Innes said of their first meeting: 'We first met in a big Irish pub in South London, the New Cross Arms ... he was quite plump in those days, and he was wearing Billy Bunter check trousers, a Victorian frock coat, black coat tails, horrible little oval, violet-tinted pince-nez glasses, he had a euphonium under his arm, and large rubber false ears. And I thought, well, this is an interesting character.'Stephen Fry's BBC Radio 4 tribute. About this time, Stanshall changed his first name to 'Vivian', the name his father had abandoned. This was not made his legal name until 1977.\"Interview with Ki Longfellow-Stanshall\", The Bristolian, May 1988 Those who knew him from his student days continued to call him Vic. Later friends and collaborators knew him as Viv.", "Stanshall formed a number of short-lived groups during 1970 alone, including biG GRunt (formed while the Bonzos were still on their farewell tour, and including fellow Bonzos Roger Ruskin Spear and Dennis Cowan, and with Anthony 'Bubs' White on guitar), The Sean Head Showband (again featuring Cowan and White), Gargantuan Chums, and the slightly longer-lived Bonzo Dog Freaks, with Innes and the ever-faithful Cowan and White (this conglomerate was also known simply as 'Freaks'). Early that year, biG GRunt recorded a well-received session for BBC Radio 1 Disc Jockey John Peel, and shortly afterwards made a memorable appearance on BBC television. Despite this promising start, biG GRunt dissolved during their first UK tour when Stanshall became incapacitated by the onset of an anxiety disorder that caused a nervous breakdown and would continue to plague him for the rest of his life."]}, {"page": "1972 in music", "response": ["*Electric Shocks \u2013 Roger Ruskin Spear"]}, {"page": "Peter Banks", "response": ["Parallel to work on the third Flash album, Banks and guitarist Jan Akkerman became friends and started to play and record together.

Shortly afterwards Spoons secured the band their first regular pub gig at The Kensington in Notting Hill, where they were noticed by \"Big\" Sid Nicholls who would soon join them as second banjo-player. Big Sid in turn introduced Roger Ruskin Spear (son of the British artist Ruskin Spear) to the band. With his interest in sculpture and the manufacture of early electronic gadgets, objets d'art, and sound-making systems, and having already recently played in a one-off impromptu scratch band with Slater and Innes, Spear also soon became a member of the Bonzos. From his own defunct band The Jungle Orchestra, Spear brought with him trumpeter Leon \"Lenny\" Williams to replace the departing Wilkes.", "In November The Bonzos released their second album The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse (the title being a euphemism for an outside toilet), which showcased a marked change in musical direction from Gorilla. After an introductory series of straight-faced street interviews with bewildered pedestrians (conducted by current bassist Joel Druckman and featuring the public's reactions to Vivian Stanshall cavorting about wearing only his underpants, shoes and a papier-mache rabbit head) self-proclaimed 'breezy opener' \"We Are Normal\" soon launches itself towards a faintly terrifying Zappa-esque psychedelic crescendo. Elsewhere, \"Can Blue Men Sing the Whites?\" rather savagely teases some of the heavy-hitters of the then highly-fashionable British Blues Boom against a reasonably-authentic Brit-blues musical backdrop of its own. Other songs such as \"Postcard\" and \"My Pink Half of the Drainpipe\" skewer parochial suburban British pastimes and attitudes, while the anarchic \"Trouser Press\" \u2014 featuring a 'solo' by Roger Ruskin Spear on a genuine trouser press he had had fitted with a pickup \u2013 later gave its name to the American anglophile rock magazine Trouser Press. 1920s-style croon-along \"Hello Mabel\" (complete with musical flock of sheep) is the only real reminder of The Bonzos' original musical style, while \"Eleven Moustachioed Daughters\", Stanshall's darkly tribal homage to Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \"Feast of the Mau-Mau\", closes the LP in an unexpectedly nightmarish manner.", "It was at this point the stress of managing the group's affairs, while simultaneously writing half of their material and performing front of stage, began to take a serious toll on Stanshall's physical and mental health. Nevertheless, he and the others opted to embark upon a second American tour during September. Innes said that when the band picked him up at his house to drive to the airport, Stanshall answered the door with his head completely shaved, which gave him a startled, almost frightened look. True to bad form, the trip was cut short after Roger Ruskin Spear suffered a personal family tragedy and shockingly no-one from the UK office saw fit to inform him or the others about it until well after the event. An understandably enraged Spear immediately abandoned the tour and returned to the UK. Initially the band attempted to fulfill the remaining dates without him, but the tour really began to derail after a rancorous press interview where Stanshall and Innes complained about recent events and the general lack of support and promotion from their record company. Their candour only led to the band and Liberty Records becoming further alienated from each other. When Stanshall also began displaying signs of a complete nervous collapse under the strain of his duties as front man and manager, he and the band quickly decided to cut the tour short at great expense to their future ambitions. As a collective, they would never return to America.", "While the group formally disbanded in 1970, their record company compelled them to reunite in late 1971 to fulfil a contractual obligation and record a final album.  Titled Let's Make Up and Be Friendly, the album was released in 1972.  The edition of the Bonzo Dog Band that made the Friendly LP featured only Stanshall, Innes and bassist Dennis Cowan from the \"classic\" earlier line-ups, although Roger Ruskin Spear appears on one track, and \"Legs\" Larry Smith on two.

The various Stanshall impersonators included Stephen Fry, Ade Edmondson, Phill Jupitus and Paul Merton (who needed to read the words to \"Monster Mash\" from cue cards at the show).
