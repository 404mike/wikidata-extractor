Musician Martin Gordon documented the story with the song \"Panama\" from his 2009 release Time Gentlemen Please. In fiction, it inspired a 2009 novel by Adrian Gere called Return from the Dead, and a 2010 storyline in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street saw the character Joe McIntyre attempt the same thing. In 2015, it was mentioned in the BBC soap opera EastEnders when it was revealed that the character Kathy Beale and her husband faked their deaths in South Africa for insurance payouts. The song \"Simian Son\" by Jez Lowe concerning incidents in Hartlepool references the incident.
