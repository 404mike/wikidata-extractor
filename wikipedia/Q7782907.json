At club level she played for Tottenham Hotspur's women's section and represented Friends of Fulham in the WFA Cup final. Wiseman won the WFA Cup in 1984 with Howbury.\n\nPeople should remember and respect there was a game before 1993, that pioneers built the foundations and paved the way for what is happening now. There were so many talented players, like [Terry] Wiseman (England and Fulham goalkeeper). She was a mentor to me, I learnt so much off her.\n\u2014 Marieanne Spacey speaking to On the Ball magazine.In her other career as an animator Wiseman worked on The Snowman and later moved to Los Angeles County to work for DisneyToon Studios, recently working as a timing director on Phineas and Ferb.
