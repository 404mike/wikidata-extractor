As a Member of Parliament, his focus was firmly on the interests of his constituency and constituents. Throughout his time in parliament, he took a keen interest in the Scotch whisky industry, which was the key employer in the constituency. The nuclear base at Faslane was also in his constituency, and his constituents were also affected by the decline of the shipbuilding industry on the Lower Clyde. Although a backbencher for all of his time in the Commons, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland, Bruce Millan, from 1976 until 1979, during the period when the Labour government was proposing to implement Scottish devolution. He also served for many years as a member of the Chairman's panel, and eventually as the regular Chairman of the Scottish Grand Committee. He was significantly, and controversially, involved in the campaign against abortion, co-sponsoring an ultimately unsuccessful private member's bill introduced by his friend and colleague, James White, MP for Glasgow Pollok, to tighten the requirements of the Abortion Act 1967. Campbell acted as an informal whip in the committees considering various bills aimed at tightening the law in this area.  Early in the 1979 parliament, he successfully piloted a private member's bill through the House of Commons to enable Scottish local authorities to offer concessionary transport to people with mental disabilities."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| James White"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Pollok (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James White"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*James White, Glasgow Pollok, 1970\u20131987"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Dunnachie", "response": ["Running up to the 1987 general election, Dunnachie was selected to follow James White as Labour candidate for Glasgow Pollok by 50 votes to 41 for Dave Churchley.

The British Abortion Act of 1967 was passed to eliminate unsupervised primitive and unhygienic procedures and had little to do with women's rights to govern their own bodies. From the emergence of the WLM in Britain activists felt the importance of shifting the debate to self-determination. In 1975, the National Abortion Campaign (NAC) was formed to organize the push toward choice. Distrust between NAC, unions and WLM activists led to several fissures, but despite the uneasy alliance the groups worked together and there was some fluidity with activists participating in multiple factions for the cause. A series of proposals were introduced in the 1970s, starting with James White\u2019s 1975 bill to restrict abortion on the basis of gestation; Bill Benyon\u2019s 1977 bill to not only limit abortion based upon gestation time but to give medical professionals an opt-out to refuse; and then in 1979, a bill introduced by John Corrie to restrict not only gestation but the grounds on which abortion could be attained. Further complicating the debate was the paucity of National Health Service facilities throughout the UK, giving women in southern England readily available abortion centers, which were lacking in other areas of the nation. Though there were a wide variety of views among individual liberationists on the topic, the movement was in favor of women's autonomy over their own bodies."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 2000s", "response": ["|James White"]}, {"page": "Socialist perspectives on abortion", "response": ["The National Abortion Campaign was developed in the UK following the failure of James White's Amendment Bill in 1975 to amend the 1967 Abortion Act  During this time the 1967 Abortion Act was under scrutiny as it required two doctors to examine a woman's medical, psychological and social situation. The Act required a woman to admit she was unfit to become a mother in order to receive approval for an abortion. During this time, doctors were still able to refuse abortions due to their personal preference against the surgery, which was considered by some to not fulfill woman's needs.
