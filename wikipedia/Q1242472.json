Shapeshifting and flight on wings away from oath-breaking husbands also figure in stories about M\u00e9lusine.

Carpenter and M. Prichard, The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), pp. 363\u20134, 383. These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of Mummers' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. Roughly half of the current body recognised 'traditional' English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century. From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes, like 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star', which combined an 18th-century French tune with a poem by English writer Jane Taylor and 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830.

At the height of the revival Sabine Baring-Gould produced A Book of Nursery Songs (1895), and Andrew Lang produced The Nursery Rhyme Book in 1897.

The word kalann means the first of the month in Cornish, but the first letter mutates to an \"h\" in some circumstances. It has been suggested that \"tow\" means garland in Cornish. This is not correct. Some have suggested that Hal-an-Tow means \u201craise the roof\". In Helston tow is pronounced to rhyme with cow and not toe. The Cornish word \"tew\" means fat, and a recent explanation of the name is that Hal-an-Tow means the eve of the fattening time. The version of the Hal-an-Tow sung by The Watersons and other folk groups has never been sung in Helston. The Helston song does not include the verse about cuckolds and horns. These words appear to have been added from Shakespeare's play As You Like It at some time by someone who does not know the history of the Helston song. See for example the version in Sabine Baring-Gould's Songs of the West (which contains errors) and the versions in Canow Kernow edited by Inglis Gundry, such as the one recorded by William Sandys in 1846. The words of the Hal-an-Tow as it is currently sung in Helston are:Hal-an-Tow Alan Kent on Helston's 'Flora Day' tradition"]}]}}
