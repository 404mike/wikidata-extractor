He studied with Arthur Hutchings and A.E.F. Dickinson at Durham University from 1947 to 1951 and gained a first-class BA in 1950. He taught music at Bishop Wordsworth's School in Salisbury (1951\u201352) before gaining his Fellowship Diploma from the Royal College of Organists in 1952. He was then appointed a lecturer at Durham University in 1953. He graduated with a BMus from Durham in that year and took the MA with a dissertation on 17th-century chamber music manuscripts in Durham Cathedral Library. He was awarded the DMus by the university in 1958. From 1961 to 1990 he was professor of music at the University of Southampton, where two of his many achievements were the creation of a music honours degree course from inauspicious beginnings, and the addition of a fine, purpose-built performance venue, the Turner Sims Concert Hall to the University's campus (1974), in collaboration with the Southampton Institute of Sound and Vibration Research.After his early studies of viol music, in particular that of John Jenkins, Evans worked mainly on the 20th century, writing articles on Jonathan Harvey, Alan Rawsthorne (for the 1980 edition of The New Grove) and especially on the music of Benjamin Britten. According to Grove, he brought to that subject \"an acute analytical mind coupled with an approach in which musical values are firmly assigned first place\".A plaque erected in his memory in the Turner Sims, funded entirely by former students, reads: \"Founder of the Department of Music ~ \nA brilliant musician and outstanding teacher who inspired countless students ~ His vision and drive gave rise to the Turner Sims Concert Hall ~ Remembered with gratitude and affection\".\nEvans died of severe double pneumonia on 1 January 2018, after a three-year battle with dementia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1979 in literature", "response": ["*Peter Evans \u2013 The Music of Benjamin Britten"]}, {"page": "Noye's Fludde", "response": ["Following God's instruction, the people and animals leave the ark singing a thankful chorus of Alleluias with more bugle fanfares in B flat. The appearance of the rainbow is accompanied by handbell chimes, a sound which dominates the final stages of the work. In the final canonical hymn, the main tune moves from F major to G major and is sung over reiterated bugle calls, joined by the handbells. In the third verse, the organ provides a brief discordant intervention, \"the one jarring note in Noye's Fludde\" according to the musicologist Peter Evans. Graham Elliott believes that this may be a musical joke in which Britten pokes gentle fun at the habits of some church organists. The mingled chimes of slung mugs and bells continue during God's final valedictory blessing. As Noye leaves, the full orchestra provides a final fortissimo salute, the opera then concluding peacefully with B flat chimes of handbells alternating with extended G major string chords \u2013 \"a hauntingly beautiful close\", says Roseberry."]}, {"page": "List of Durham University people", "response": ["* Peter Evans (Cuths) \u2013 Professor of Music at Southampton University (1961\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "Sinfonia da Requiem", "response": ["The Sinfonia is Britten's largest purely orchestral work for the concert hall.

Around his graduation, he had a nervous breakdown and largely stopped composing for four years. He spent his hiatus primarily as a freelance music critic and musicologist. Before his halting of composition, in 1959 Payne had drafted parts of the symphonic poem It Happened Once, and returning to it in 1964 under the name of Liebestod, he began to discover a newly personal style of composition."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["*Peter Evans (disambiguation), multiple people", "**Peter Evans (restaurateur) (1926\u20132014), British restaurateur", "**Peter Evans (radio personality) (1927\u20131985), 3LO breakfast announcer 1965\u20131986", "**Peter Evans (musicologist) (1929\u20132018), British musicologist, author of The Music of Benjamin Britten", "**Peter Evans (swimmer) (born 1961), Australian swimmer, won a gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics", "**Peter Evans (musician), American musician, specializes in improvisation and avant-garde music"]}, {"page": "1929 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Peter Evans, musicologist (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "Christopher Hobbs", "response": ["*West, Peter, and Peter Evans. 1971. \"Interview with Christopher Hobbs\", Contact, no. 3, pp.\u00a017\u201323."]}, {"page": "A Birthday Hansel", "response": ["Musicologist Peter Evans has analysed the cycle.
