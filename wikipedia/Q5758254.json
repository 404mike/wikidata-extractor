Sole-remaining member Greg Masters built another version of the band with guitarists Dave Carroll and Bob Wilson and drummer Bob Lamb; with Steve Gibbons being recruited later as front-man. Ultimately however, this lineup was short-lived and Masters himself departed in February 1972, and was replaced by Bob Griffin; whose tenure in the band was brief and who was replaced by former The Move member Trevor Burton.
