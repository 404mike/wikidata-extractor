He had little success in what was his only foray into first-class cricket, scoring 3 runs in the Free Foresters first-innings before being dismissed by David Russell, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by David Sayer for 7 runs. He married Judith Chadfield in 1961, with the couple having three sons. During this period he worked for Aveling-Barford as their representative in Africa and the Middle East, before leaving in 1967 when the company was taken over by British Leyland."]}, {"page": "David Pettit", "response": ["Pettit was born at Canterbury in March 1937, where he was educated at St Edmund's School. From St Edmund's he went up to Hertford College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for Oxford University in 1958 and 1959, making five appearances. His matches for Oxford were mostly trials, with Pettit handed his first trial match against Derbyshire due to the unavailability of J. A. Bailey and David Sayer, where he was employed as a new ball bowler. He was expensive and did not take a wicket and did not feature for Oxford until the following year, when he played four matches in a row, which included an appearance against the touring Indians. However, he only took 6 wickets in these matches at an expensive average of 62.00. "]}]}}
