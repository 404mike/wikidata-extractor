Known as the \"Portsmouth Papers\", this material consisted of 329 lots of Newton's manuscripts, over a third of which were filled with content that appeared to be alchemical in nature. At the time of Newton's death this material was considered \"unfit to publish\" by Newton's estate, and consequently fell into obscurity until their somewhat sensational reemergence in 1936."]}]}}
