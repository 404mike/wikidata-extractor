The Fazl Mosque in London requested Hugh Linstead, a British Member of Parliament to write to the authorities to overturn the decision made in the colony. An alternative candidate, Muhammad Ishaq Sufi, a pioneering missionary stationed in Liberia was also offered on whose behalf it is stated that a petition with 250 signatures from Ahmadi Muslims of Banjul was prepared. After holding two sessions in consultation with the Muslim members of the colony's Legislative Council, the government once again blocked the Ahmadi Muslim missionary of Pakistani heritage. As a consequence, Saifi consulted another British politician Fenner Brockway and made another failed attempt in 1958. Finally, a Nigerian Ahmadi missionary was prepared for the Gambia."]}]}}
