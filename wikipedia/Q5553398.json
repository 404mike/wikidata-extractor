She was home-schooled in her family's Christian socialist tradition and trained to be a teacher in Liverpool from 1881. She was a teacher at Bishop Otter College in Chichester from 1882 to 1884, and then taught at a working-class infant school in Chelsea until forced to stop by ill health in 1890.From 1893, she became secretary to her aunt, writer, suffragette and trade unionist Emilia Dilke (wife of Sir Charles Dilke). She published The State and Its Children in 1894, opposing child labour. She was involved with the Women's Trade Union League from 1891, and succeeded Emilia Dilke as its President in 1905. In 1908 she became president of the National Federation of Women Workers, and campaigned to protect women from industrial injuries such as lead poisoning and phossy jaw.In 1908 she was described in The Woman Worker newspaper as \"the power that moves a myriad organisations. Behind a screen of plans to abolish sweating, to organize women, to prohibit poisonous glazes in pottery, to indemnify victimized workers, her alert spirit is tirelessly in motion\". She retired in 1918, but continued to campaigning on public health issues. After Charles Dilke died in 1911, she, as his literary executor, co-wrote a two-volume biography with Stephen Gwynn (\"begun by Stephen Gwynn, M. P., completed and ed. by Gertrude M. Tuckwell\").After the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 became law on 23 December 1919, Tuckwell was one of the first seven women appointed as a Justice of the Peace, and she was the first woman magistrate in London. She was a founder member of the Magistrates' Association in 1920, and was a member of its council from 1921 to 1940.  She was the chair of the National Association of Probation Officers from 1933 to 1941. In 1930 she was inducted into the Order of the Companions of Honour.Tuckwell spent the last twenty years of her life at Little Woodlands, Wormley, Surrey. She died on 5 August 1951 at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford.Her papers are lodged in the TUC Library Collections at the University of North London. These consist of approximately 700 folders of reports, pamphlets, leaflets and press cuttings accumulated by Tuckwell, regarding women's political and economic struggles from 1890 to 1920.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Lloyd George", "response": ["On 24 December 1919, the day after the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 received Royal Assent, Margaret Lloyd George was one of the first seven women to be appointed as a Magistrate, alongside Lady Crewe, Lady Londonderry,\u00a0Elizabeth Haldane, Gertrude Tuckwell, Beatrice Webb and Mary Augusta Ward.
