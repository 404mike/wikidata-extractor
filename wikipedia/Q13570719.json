(1961) \"Possible principles underlying the transformation of sensory messages\" in Sensory Communication, MIT Press  Within the brain, neurons communicate with one another by sending electrical impulses referred to as action potentials or spikes.  One goal of sensory neuroscience is to decipher the meaning of these spikes in order to understand how the brain represents and processes information about the outside world.  Barlow hypothesized that the spikes in the sensory system formed a neural code for efficiently representing sensory information.  By efficient Barlow meant that the code minimized the number of spikes needed to transmit a given signal. This is somewhat analogous to transmitting information across the internet, where different file formats can be used to transmit a given image.  Different file formats require different number of bits for representing the same image at given distortion level, and some are better suited for representing certain classes of images than others.  According to this model, the brain is thought to use a code which is suited for representing visual and audio information representative of an organism's natural environment."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Academics of the University of Cambridge", "response": ["Horace Barlownot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Erasmus Darwin Barlow", "response": ["Born in London in 1915, he was the second son of Sir Alan Barlow, son of Sir Thomas Barlow, royal physician.

B. (1961). Possible principles underlying the transformation of sensory messages. Sensory communication, 217-234. This hypothesis suggests that the goal of the sensory system is to create an efficient representation of the stimulus. Recently, this has intersected with the idea of a 'sparse' code, one that is represented using the fewest units possible. It has been shown that surround suppression increases the efficiency of transmitting visual information, and may form a sparse code. If many cells respond to parts of the same stimulus, for instance, a lot of redundant information is encoded.Schwartz, O., & Simoncelli, E. (2001). Natural signal statistics and sensory gain control. Nature neuroscience 819\u2013825. Retrieved from http://www.cns.nyu.edu/csh04/Articles/Schwartz-Simoncelli-01.pdf. The cell needs metabolic energy for each action potential it produces. Therefore, surround suppression likely helps to produce a neural code that is more metabolically efficient. There are additional theoretical advantages, including the removal of statistical redundancy inherent in natural scene statistics, as well as decorrelation of neural responses, which means less information to process later in the pathway."]}, {"page": "Davida Teller", "response": ["Davida Young Teller was born in Yonkers, New York on July 25, 1938, to David and Jean (Sturges) Young.
