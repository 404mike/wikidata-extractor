He came from humble beginnings and left school at the age of 12. At the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for the army. During his time in the forces, he started a troupe concert party. On leaving the army, he took up work as a light comedian, dancer, and singer. He toured extensively, appearing in variety, revues and by the early 1930s reached the top of the bill in the large music halls including the London Palladium.\nHe recorded many songs, some of which he wrote. He appeared frequently on radio, but television did not really suit his style. He appeared and starred in 14 feature films. \nHe was known for his flamboyant suits, his wicked charm, and his risqu\u00e9 jokes which often got him into trouble with the censors. He made his last recording in January 1963 and died four months later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Max Miller (1894\u20131963)"]}, {"page": "Rhyming slang", "response": ["In the 20th century, rhyming slang began to be based on the names of celebrities \u2014 Gregory Peck (neck; cheque), Ruby Murray [as Ruby] (curry), Alan Whicker [as \"Alan Whickers\"] (knickers), Puff Daddy (caddy), Max Miller (pillow [pronounced ]), Meryl Streep (cheap), Nat King Cole (\"dole\"), Britney Spears (beers, tears), Henry Halls (balls) \u2014 and after pop culture references \u2014 Captain Kirk (work), Pop Goes the Weasel (diesel), Mona Lisa (pizza), Mickey Mouse (Scouse), Wallace and Gromit (vomit), Brady Bunch (lunch), Bugs Bunny (money), Scooby-Doo (clue), Winnie the Pooh (shoe), and Schindler's List (pissed).

In the early 20th century restrictions were placed on lewdness in performances, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the Lord Chamberlain to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. Max Miller had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from.

The Hayes Cinema was renamed Gem Cinema before its closure in the middle of World War I, in 1916. (2.) The Regent Cinema stood between 1924 and 1938 at 16 Station Road, Hayes \u2013 now the site of a branch of NatWest bank. The Regent Cinema subsequently became The Regent Theatre (1948\u201354). Playwright John Osborne performed at the theatre as a young actor, and stars including Kenneth Williams, Diana Dors and John Le Mesurier performed there also early in their careers. Sylvia Rayman's groundbreaking \"all-women play\" Women of Twilight (1951) was premiered at Hayes's Regent Theatre. (3.) The Corinth Cinema opened in 1933 at 1040 Uxbridge Road. Renamed The Essoldo in 1949, it was the first cinema in the area to be equipped with CinemaScope and stereophonic sound. After purchasing an alternative building nearby in 1957 (infra), the Essoldo chain closed this cinema in 1961. The address is now the site of the town's Point West Building. (4.) The Ambassador Theatre existed between 1938 and 1961 on the area of East Avenue, Hayes which is now occupied by the British Telecommunications Centre (formerly a GPO telephone exchange). Actress Valerie Hobson made a personal appearance on the occasion of the Ambassador Theatre's opening on 19 December 1938; she starred in the film screened for the occasion: This Man Is News. (5.) The Savoy Cinema existed from 1939 to 1957 at 466 Uxbridge Road, Hayes. The building was designed by noted cinema architect George Coles. Some famous artists performed on stage at Hayes's Savoy Cinema over the years \u2013 Max Miller, Josephine Baker and Adam Faith among them. The Essoldo chain bought the Savoy in 1957, renaming it The Essoldo in 1962 (after closing its nearby namesake in 1961). This incarnation of the Essoldo closed in 1967. Coles' building was converted into an Essoldo Bingo Club; it became a Ladbrokes Lucky 7 Club, and is now a branch of Mecca Bingo. (6.) The Classic Cinema (1972\u20131986) was located above a Waitrose supermarket, at 502 Uxbridge Road, Hayes.

The exemption of the theatres from this latter act prompted some critics to denounce this legislation as an attempt to deprive the working classes of their pleasures, as a form of social control, whilst sparing the supposedly more responsible upper classes who patronised the theatres (though this could be due to the licensing restrictions brought about due to the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, which also applied to public houses).Lucinda Jarret (1997): Stripping in Time: A History of Erotic Dancing: 107 Even so, the music hall gave rise to such major stars as George Formby, Gracie Fields, Max Miller, Will Hay, and Flanagan and Allen during this period.", "Moss Empires, the largest British music hall chain, closed the majority of its theatres in 1960, closely followed by the death of music hall stalwart Max Miller in 1963, prompting one contemporary to write that: \"Music-halls\u00a0... died this afternoon when they buried Max Miller\".Stoll-Moss Theatres Ltd (Company History) accessed 2 November 2007Clarkson Rose (1964) Red Plush and Greasepaint: 136 Miller himself had sometimes said that the genre would die with him.

Formby's screen and stage persona of innocence and simplicity was not seen as ignorance or stupidity, although Basil Dean disagreed and thought that Formby \"didn't act gormless as many successful Lancashire comedians have done, he was gormless\". Much of the innocence in Formby's performance is connected to sex, and the use of double entendres within his songs. John Caughie and Kevin Rockett, in their examination of British film, and Richards, see a connection between Formby's approach to sex and the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill. Richards sees the function of Formby's humour as being the same as McGill's: \"the harmless diffusion of a major source of tension in a deeply repressed and conventional society\". Formby's delivery of the sexual content\u2014what McFarlane identifies as being \"sung with such a toothy grin and air of innocence\"\u2014negated any possible indignation, and this contrasts with the more overtly sexual delivery of other performers of the time, such as Max Miller and Frank Randle."]}, {"page": "Charlie Chester", "response": ["Charlie Chester MBE (26 April 1914\u00a0\u2013 26 June 1997) was an English comedian, radio and television presenter and writer, broadcasting almost continuously from the 1940s to the 1990s.
