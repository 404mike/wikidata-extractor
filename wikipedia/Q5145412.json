After a stint with Greenock Morton in 2000, he moved on to non-league Dover Athletic later in the year following spells with Greenock Morton and Stevenage Borough. In 2001, he signed with Yeovil Town; he would become a cult figure at the club over his five-year stay, helping them win promotion from the Conference National to League One. He spent two years from 2006 with Port Vale, before ending his career with Woking at the end of the 2008\u201309 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darren Wrack", "response": ["He scored seven goals in 43 League One games during the 2004\u201305 season. He signed a new contract in June 2005 which resulted in a pay cut but guaranteed him a testimonial; manager Paul Merson said that: \"this is a real boost to us because when he's fit his name is first on the team sheet\". Wrack broke his leg following a challenge by Colin Miles during a 2\u20131 defeat to Yeovil Town in September 2005. It took him 13 months to return to full fitness, during which time Walsall were relegated. He marked his return to action with a last-minute goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Swansea City in a Football League Trophy tie on 17 October 2006. However, he pulled his hamstring during a 1\u20130 win over Hereford United on 18 November, which was only his second league start in a year. New manager Richard Money led the club to the League Two title in the 2006\u201307 season. Wrack was given a testimonial match against Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Bescot Stadium in April 2008, which attracted only 1,330 supporters. Both Wrack and long-time teammate Ian Roper were released by the club the following month; this was despite Wrack playing 44 games during the 2007\u201308 season."]}, {"page": "Colin Pluck", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Miles "]}, {"page": "Colin Ian Miles", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Miles"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Watford F.C. season", "response": ["|Colin Miles"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw Martin Foyle make a number of signings, including: Danny Sonner (Peterborough United); Jason Talbot (Mansfield Town); Paul Harsley (Macclesfield Town); Richard Walker (Crewe Alexandra); Danny Whitaker (Macclesfield Town); Colin Miles (Yeovil Town); and Akpo Sodje (Darlington).
