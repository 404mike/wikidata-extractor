He arrived at a similar bow design to Tourte, though  entirely through independent means.\nBows made by Dodd are judged to be of a fine quality, but the measurements and characteristics of his bows are not entirely consistent over time. For example, some bows were made slightly shorter than the norm. \nHis later bows are particularly fine, though judged to be a little short. The celebrated 20th century violist, Lillian Fuchs, owned a fine viola bow which sold in May 2014 for $22,800 at Tarisio Auctions.\nThough Dodd was often in dire need of funds, it was recounted that he was very secretive about his art, and once turned down an offer of 1000 pounds sterling for a copy of his pattern. He also refused to teach pupils for the same reason. Dodd used 2 forms for the head ; the slender \"swan\" type and the squat \" hammer \" head type, more common in Italy and France.\nAn excellent choice of Pernambuco wood was available to Dodd and much of this came to England in the form of Barrels. This explains the numerous traces of nail holes which sometimes run right through his sticks.\nAccording to Pierre Baillot, it seems that Viotti may have used a Dodd bow which was about 2\u00bd cm shorter than the Tourte model.\nDodd had the innovative idea of using double saws to cut the curve of the bow directly out of a plank of wood - rather than bending a straight bow with heat to achieve the curvature. While this method creates a bow that draws an excellent tone, it lacks the ability to bounce off the string that the classical method supports.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lillian Fuchs", "response": ["She performed many standard and non-standard pieces in the viola repertoire, including significant 20th century works.  Fuchs was known for her warm, beautiful tone, expert musicianship and technical mastery. She owned a fine instrument made by Matteo Goffriller (1659\u20131742) and was the lifelong custodian of another lovely viola, darker in tone, by  Gasparo da Sal\u00f2 (1540\u20131609). She played with a bow made by the English bow maker, John Dodd (1752\u20131839), which sold in May 2014 for $22,800 at Tarisio Auctions. Dodd bows are often shorter than other viola bows, a quality Fuchs prized for the greater control it permitted and also for its sheer practicality, since she was of diminutive stature. She used a gut 'A' string, considering it a sacrilege to use a metal 'A' string on an old Italian instrument. Both her violas were about 16 inches in size, and both were also passed on to Lillian's granddaughter, Jeanne Abby Mallow."]}, {"page": "Anshel Brusilow", "response": ["Soon after becoming concertmaster of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Brusilow purchased a 1743 Guarneri del Gesu violin (Cozio 49626), which today is known as \"The Brusilow.\"  The violin, reportedly, was once owned by the French violinist, Jacques Pierre Rode (1774\u20131830), who had been a court violinist to Napoleon.  The provenance also includes W.E. Hill & Sons; Arthur Beare (until 1929); Alfred Oppenheim Corbin (1874\u20131941), a Dutch-born London-then-New-York-investment-banker, amateur violinist, and serious collector of violins (1929 to 1931); Leo Reisman, who purchased it through Emil Herrmann (from 1931); Theodore Pitcairn, a philanthropist who purchased it through Rembert Wurlitzer (around 1953); Brusilow (1959 to 1966), then to its previous owner (name unknown). Brusilow acquired the violin, through an arrangement, from Pitcairn, who, with Brusilow standing at his side at William Moennig & Son in Philadelphia, wrote a check for $28,000.  Moennig, according to Brusilow, \"threw in a Tourte bow for free,\" which Brusilow still owned in the late 1980s.  Brusilow wrote in his 2015 book, Shoot The Conductor: Too Close to Monteux, Szell, and Ormandy, that he also owned a John Dodd bow, and preferred it over the Tourte."]}, {"page": "Keith Peck", "response": ["Peck established his own shop in 1976, making his own model, as well as copies of Dominique Peccatte, Fran\u00e7ois Tourte, and Francois Nicolas Voirin. and frog copies of Fran\u00e7ois-Jude Gaulard, John Dodd, Francois Lupot, Nicolaus Kittel, Pierre Simon, Voirin and many more.
