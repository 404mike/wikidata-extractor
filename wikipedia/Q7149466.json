His childhood was materially comfortable, but his father was a cold and domineering parent, opposed to any form of play or entertainment, and feared by both his son and wife. According to family legend, Claude had tried to kill his newborn son by leaving him exposed on a window-ledge during a snowstorm. The story may not be true, but Bowles believed it was and that it encapsulated his relationship with his father. Warmth in his childhood was provided by his mother, who read Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe to him\u00a0\u2013 it was to the latter that he later attributed his own desire to write stories, such as \"The Delicate Prey\", \"A Distant Episode\", and \"Pages from Cold Point\".", "It was during the autumn of 1930 in Paris that Bowles began work on his own first musical composition, the Sonata for Oboe and Clarinet, which he finished the following year. It premiered in New York at the Aeolian Hall on Wigmore Street, 16 December 1931. The entire concert (which also included work by Copland and Virgil Thomson) was panned by New York critics. (Bowles's first-known composition was completed earlier in Berlin: an adaptation as piano music of some vocal pieces by Kurt Schwitters.)\"Bowles letter of 9 June 1931 to Edouard Roditi, Berlin,\" In Touch: The Letters of Paul Bowles", "Bowles has frequently been featured in anthologies as a gay writer, but he regarded such categories as both absurd and irrelevant. After a brief sojourn in France, the couple were prominent among the literary figures of New York throughout the 1940s. Paul Bowles also worked under Virgil Thomson, as a music critic at the New York Herald Tribune. His zarzuela The Wind Remains, based on a poem by Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, was performed in 1943 with choreography by Merce Cunningham and conducted by Leonard Bernstein. His translation of Jean-Paul Sartre's play Huis Clos (\"No Exit\"), directed by John Huston, won a Drama Critic's Award in 1943.", "In 1947, Paul Bowles received a contract for a novel from Doubleday; with the advance, he moved permanently to Tangier. Jane joined him there the next year. Bowles commented:", "In 1957, Jane Bowles suffered a mild stroke, which marked the beginning of a long and painful decline in her health. Her condition preoccupied Paul Bowles until Jane's death in 1973.", "In the summers of 1980 and 1982, Bowles conducted writing workshops in Morocco, at the American School of Tangier (under the auspices of the School of Visual Arts in New York). These were considered successful. Among several students who have become successful authors are Rodrigo Rey Rosa,Jeffrey Gray, \"Placing the Placeless: A Conversation with Rodrigo Rey Rosa\", North Carolina State University the 2004 Winner of the Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias National Prize in Literature, and Mark Terrill. Bowles designated Rey Rosa as the literary heir of his and Jane Bowles's estates. In 1982 Bowles published Points in Time, subtitled Tales From Morocco, a collection of stories. Divided into eleven parts, the work consists of untitled story fragments, anecdotes, and travel narratives. These stories are not included in either The Stories of Paul Bowles (Ecco Press) or Collected Stories and Later Writings (The Library of America).", "In 1988, when Bowles was asked in an interview about his social life, he replied, \"I don't know what a social life is\u00a0... My social life is restricted to those who serve me and give me meals, and those who want to interview me.\" When asked in the same interview how he would summarize his achievement, he said, \"I've written some books and some music. That's what I've achieved.\"\"Paul Bowles: The Complete Outsider,\" Interview with Catherine Warnow and Regina Weinreich/ 1988, in Conversations with Paul Bowles, ed.

The music was performed by Jonathan Sheffer leading the Eos Orchestra. A related symposium on Bowles's work and interview were held at the New School for Social Research. A Canadian documentary on his life, Let It Come Down: The Life of Paul Bowles won Best Documentary at the 27th Annual International Emmy Awards in New York City.", "Visitors in 1998 reported that Bowles's wit and intellect endured. He continued to welcome visitors to his apartment in Tangier but, on the advice of doctors and friends, limited interviews. One of the last was an interview with Stephen Morison, Jr., a friend teaching at the American School of Tangier. It was featured in the July/August 1999 issue of Poets & Writers magazine. On June 6, 1999, Irene Herrmann, the executrix of the Paul Bowles Music Estate, interviewed him to focus on his musical career; this was published in September 2003.The Last Interview with Paul Bowles, University of California Press", "Paul Bowles lived for 52 of his 88 years in Tangier. He became strongly identified with the city and symbolized American immigrants. Obituary writers always linked his life to his residency there.", "Paul Bowles first studied music with Aaron Copland. In the fall of 1931, following an introduction from Copland, he entered the studio of Virgil Thomson.Thomson, Virgil. Virgil Thomson. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1966, pp. 206\u2013207.", "Bowles had thought of himself first as a poet, having published some verse in his brief time at the University of Virginia in the pages of transition. Unfortunately, the quality of his poetry eluded any of the intellectuals he would later encounter in Paris. Among them was Gertrude Stein, from whom he received the sobriquet, \"the manufactured savage,\" and who begged him to give up writing poetry.Briatte, Robert. An American in Paris: \"Portrait of Paul Bowles\". Liner Notes from Koch International (3-1574-2), 1995, pp. 5\u20136.", "For Copland the allure of Bowles's music would never diminish.

Liner Notes from Etcetera Records (KTC 10109), 1984, pp. 2\u20133.", "Following Virgil Thomson's retirement from his critic's post in 1954, reminiscing on his wish Paul Bowles had taken over the position, Bowles remarked, \"I don't think I could have handled it, any more than I could have followed a career in composition. I lacked the musical training that [Virgil] and Aaron had.\"", "Paul Bowles referred to Tangier as \"a place where it is still hard to find a piano in tune.\" Regarding his establishment as an author in Morocco, Bowles said:", "Only in the decade before his death was there a renewed interest in his musical output from the 1930s and '40s. This movement may have culminated in May 1994, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Rond-Point in Paris, with the presentation of a live concert performance, and at which the then 83-year-old Paul Bowles was in attendance. The program included a number of Bowles's original songs and pieces for piano, plus musical tributes and portraits of the composer by Virgil Thomson, Leonard Bernstein, and Phillip Ramey.Petit de Voize, Yves. An American in Paris. Liner Notes from Koch International (3-1574-2), 1995, pp. 7\u20138. At least as regards the past neglect of his own catalogue, this ongoing revival may serve as proof of Bowles's own words: \"Music only exists when it is played.\"", "Renewal of respect for Paul Bowles's music has led to several commercial recording projects. In 2016 the Invencia Piano Duo (Andrey Kasparov and Oksana Lutsyshyn), in collaboration with Naxos Records and its American Classics division, released two CDs of Bowles's complete piano works.", "Paul Bowles was a pioneer in the field of North African ethnomusicology, making field recordings from 1959 to 1961 of traditional Moroccan music for the US Library of Congress.The US Library of Congress Recordings were inaugurated to act as a \"repository for ethnographic documentation appealing to folklorists and cultural documentarians working in this country and in foreign lands as well.\" Folklife Center News, Spring 2003, page 5 The collection includes dance music, secular music, music for Ramadan and other festivals, and music for animistic rituals.

The jury gave the following citation: \"Paul Bowles is a storyteller of the utmost purity and integrity. He writes of a world before God became man; a world in which men and women in extremis are seen as components in a larger, more elemental drama. His prose is crystalline and his voice unique.
