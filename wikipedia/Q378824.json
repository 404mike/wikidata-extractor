He had his share of luck (water skier Mike Hazelwood was tied in first place in the shooting when he mis-fired the decisive shot, gifting 10 points to Fielding) but he was on top form this season. He had every reason to believe he had a strong chance in both International and World Superstars later that year, but, as so often in Superstars, he could not hold his form; the ever-increasing levels of competition saw him lose, first to a resurgent Ripley in the second International, then to a motor-oil powered Jody Scheckter in the 1981 World Final. Again, Fielding would never win another Superstars event. The curse of the European champions seemed to be holding strong."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1976 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Jim Fox, Danny Nightingale and Adrian Parker \u2014 Modern Pentathlon, Men's Team Competition", "* Jim Fox", "* Jim Fox"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1964 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Jim Fox", "* Jim Fox"]}, {"page": "Modern pentathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|Jim FoxDanny NightingaleAdrian Parker "]}, {"page": "Boris Onishchenko", "response": ["After the first event of the pentathlon, the Soviet team found itself in fourth place, trailing closely behind Britain.
