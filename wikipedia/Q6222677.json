The impetus for the founding of the Civic Trust came from an increasing concern about post-war planning and over-development. The city\u2019s medieval core, and also the buried archaeological heritage of its much longer history, were in considerable danger from the developers.The Archbishop of York, Cyril Garbett, and the Lord Mayor Fred Gaines were in attendance at the first meeting of the Trust. In his speech, the Archbishop referred to the four threats facing the city: time and weather; war (the city had suffered some damage during the Baedeker raid in 1942); commercial greed; and ignorance \u2013 especially that of \u201cpeople who thought they were improving and restoring when really they were ruining and destroying\u201d.", "One of the Trust's most prominent activities has been to help provide the impetus for the establishment of the University of York through John Bowes Morrell. It was influential in establishing the first pedestrianised footstreets in York, and in the 1980s this included the closing of Deangate, the road that cut across the Minster precinct and was causing damage to the Minster's foundations. Its role in protecting York's architectural heritage is cited in the Royal Commission volumes on the historical monuments of York."]}, {"page": "Bowes Morrell House", "response": ["The house was partially restored in 1932.  In 1954, it was Grade II* listed, and in 1966, it was bought and more thoroughly restored by the York Civic Trust.  It renamed the building after John Bowes Morrell, one of its founders.  It was later occupied by the Council for British Archaeology.  In 2004, it was purchased by the York Conservation Trust, and from 2012 it was occupied by the Cyrenians drug and alcohol rehabilitation charity."]}]}}
