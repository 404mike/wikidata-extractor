His season was disrupted by injury and in the latter stages he was used as only as a substitute. However, he shone in Hereford's successful play-off campaign, scoring an extra-time winner in the semi-final against Morecambe. In the final itself he was brought on in the second half with Hereford 2\u20131 down, and soon made an impact. He skillfully controlled a flick on by Andy Ferrell, played the ball out to Simon Travis and then powerfully headed the return cross into the net to equalise. In the dying minutes of extra time he also did well to run the clock down by keeping the ball in the corner while fending off the attentions of several opposing players and earning Hereford 3 consecutive corners. Unfortunately, Guy was one of several Hereford players released shortly after the final."]}, {"page": "2006 Conference National play-off Final", "response": ["Hereford responded by bringing on Guy Ipoua who equally made an impact on the game.
