During his time at La Tante Claire, Koffmann worked with several eminent chefs, including Ramsay, Marco Pierre White, Marcus Wareing and Tom Kitchin. He did not get on with Wareing, who made his feelings clear about Koffmann in Simon Wright's book Tough Cookies, saying of Koffmann, \"Three-star kitchen! This guy didn't tell you anything. He didn't tell you what the lunch menu was, he didn't tell you where to get anything\u2026 You didn't know if you were coming or going\u2026 I could not click with the man.\" More recently Wareing speaks better of Koffmann, saying \"Koffmann is a complete thoroughbred.
