He also had a concurrent career as a footballer and had a long tenure with Brentford F.C.. He was born in Turnham Green and died in Tooting Bec. A right-handed batsman who occasionally bowled off breaks, Hendren was one of the most prolific batsmen of the inter-war period, averaging 47.63 in his 51 Test matches and 50.80 in all his first-class matches. He has the third highest first-class run aggregate of 57,611 runs (after Jack Hobbs and Frank Woolley), and his total of 170 centuries ranks second only to Hobbs, who was a personal friend. Hendren was a noted wit, a keen practical joker and had a talent for mimicry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ashes", "response": ["Despite the debut of Donald Bradman, the inexperienced Australians, led by Jack Ryder, were heavily defeated, losing 4\u20131.Harte, pp. 312\u2013316.

There has been speculation that this incident helped develop Jardine's antipathy towards Australians, although Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas denies this.Douglas, pp. 30\u201331. Jardine's attitude towards Australia hardened after he toured the country in 1928\u201329.Douglas, p. 64.

The team manager was  His Grace Bernard Marmaduke Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, KG, GCVO, PC, Earl Marshal and Chief Butler of England, and it was joked that \"Lord Ted\" could only be controlled by a duke. In fact, the Duke was the President of Sussex County Cricket Club, had been instrumental in Dexter's appointment as county captain, shared his interests in horse racing and golf and was very popular with the Australian public. In the tour match between the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and an Australian XI Dexter hit 102 in 110 minutes, including 2 sixes and 13 fours. John Woodcock  of The Times wrote \"I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely to forget it. Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards.\"Woodcock, John (10 November 1962) The Times. At the Adelaide Oval Dexter included \"a six from a gigantic hit onto the roof of the stand \u2013 one of the biggest hits ever seen at the ground.\"Moyes and Goodman, p. 75 He was the main draw in the England team and over a million spectators came to see the tourists, the most since 1936\u201337. The tour returned a record profit for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) of \u00a324,000, beating the \u00a317,000 of 1946\u201347.Swanton, pp. 129\u2013130 Dexter continued his good run of form to equal Patsy Hendren's England record of six consecutive Test 50s (85 and 172 against Pakistan and 70, 99, 93 and 52 against Australia), which he soon shared with Ken Barrington and more recently Alastair Cook. His powerful innings enlivened the First and Second Tests and gave England a 1\u20130 lead in the series. Australia came back to win the Third Test at Sydney, where Dexter had preferred to keep his fast bowling attack from the Second Test even when Fred Trueman volunteered to stand down in favour of a second spinner to Fred Titmus. In the end the unsupported Titmus took 7/79 in the first innings and Australia won by 8 wickets, E.W. Swanton and others thought that if either David Allen or Ray Illingworth had been in the team England would have won the Ashes. Even so, the match might have been saved if Dexter had not conceded 27 runs off 26 balls so that the teams would not have to return the next day to finish the game. The last few overs were played in the rain and it rained for most of the fifth day, so England might have won the Ashes. Dexter's negative field placings and lack of urgency failed to regain the Ashes and the painful draws in the Fourth and Fifth Tests particularly spoilt the atmosphere, as Richie Benaud was determined to hold onto the Ashes and Dexter was content to draw a series in Australia. In mitigation the Adelaide pitch was flat as a pancake. The Sydney ground was so saturated in the days before the match that mowing was impossible before the start. The \"square\" was like one large bunker and the outfield like a meadow. Barely a ball reached the boundary. Benaud was an advocate of \"go ahead\" captaincy and Dexter for \"brighting up\" cricket and their reputations were unfairly tarnished.Trueman, pp. 281\u2013282Moyes and Goodman, pp. 101\u2013102Swanton, pp. 124\u2013125Titmus, pp. 102\u2013103"]}, {"page": "Rochdale Cricket Club", "response": ["Famous players to have played cricket for Rochdale included Cecil Parkin, who was the club's professional in 1921 when he was selected to play for England in The Ashes Test against the Australians; when Parkin was picked for England, Rochdale recruited another England Test player, Patsy Hendren, to play instead for a single match against Heywood.

He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds and was seen as one of the main English threats.Douglas, pp. 68\u201369. In his first hundred, the crowd engaged in some good-natured joking at Jardine's expense, but he was jeered by the crowd in his second hundred for batting too slowly. His third hundred was described by Bradman as one of the finest exhibitions of strokeplay that he had seen; Jardine accelerated after another slow start, during which he was again barracked, to play some excellent shots.Douglas, pp. 66\u201367. The crowds took an increasing dislike to him, partially for his success with the bat, but mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear. His first public action in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Then, he wore a Harlequin cap, given to people who played good cricket at Oxford. It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting, as both Jardine and M.C.C. captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour, although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding.Douglas, pp. 81\u201382. However, this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds. They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators, with his general demeanour drawing one comment of \"Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?\"Fingleton, pp. 84\u201385. Jardine's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour.Frith, p. 335.Douglas, pp. 66, 81\u201382. Nevertheless, Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could still have brought the crowds onto his side by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them.Fingleton, pp. 89\u201390. It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century at the start of the tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to a sympathetic Hunter Hendry that \"All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob\".Frith, p. 71. After the innings, when Patsy Hendren said that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied \"It's fucking mutual\".Douglas, p. 68. Due to the large number of good close fielders in the side, Jardine did not field in the slips, his usual position for Surrey, but next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked, particularly when chasing the ball: he was not a good fielder on the boundary.Douglas, p. 82.

In the third Test, England began the fourth innings requiring 332 to win on a rain-damaged pitch, a task critics believed impossible.Lemmon, p. 87. A large opening partnership from Hobbs and Sutcliffe gave England a chance, and Hobbs sent a message to the England dressing room suggesting a tactical change in the batting order. But the team could not find Chapman, who according to Percy Fender, in attendance as a journalist, spent most of his time socialising with guests in the Ladies' Stand. Consequently, the team followed Hobbs' plan without the approval of the captain.Douglas, pp. 74\u201375. England's batsmen took the total to within 14 of victory when the fourth wicket fell. Chapman came in and batted in an unusual way; after attempting some big shots, he played ultra-defensively, possibly in an attempt to allow Patsy Hendren to reach fifty runs before England won. Hendren was out soon after, then Chapman tried to hit a six and was caught. The batsmen continued to play recklessly and a further wicket fell to a run out. Douglas describes the end of the match: \"Meanwhile, [England batsman George Geary] was quite unruffled by the sudden upsets. He wound up for the next delivery and thumped it through mid-on for 4, bellowing, 'Dammit, we've done 'em!' It was an appropriate way for a side under Chapman to win the Ashes.\"Douglas, p. 77.

After \"long spells of bowling\" in England's first innings, Mankad top-scored for his team with 67 in the second innings. India went on to lose the match by ten wickets. However, Wisden wrote in praise of Mankad calling him a \"valuable all-round player\" alongside teammates Lala Amarnath and Vijay Hazare. Former England Test cricketer Patsy Hendren rated Mankad as India's \"best all-rounder\". In the Second Test in Manchester, Mankad claimed a five-wicket haul in England's first innings. He contributed 42 with the bat and picked two wickets in a drawn cause in the final Test at the Oval. Mankad completed the tour with a double of a thousand runs and hundred wickets, the first tourist to achieve the feat since Learie Constantine of the West Indies in 1928. He finished with 1,120 runs at 28.00 and 129 wickets at 20.76 apiece. John Arlott wrote of him: \"From his first over in England, Mankad was a good slow left-hander.

This was in contrast to the success Hirst enjoyed at Eton.Hodgson, p. 56.

He played in all three Tests against West Indies in 1928. This was West Indies' inaugural Test series and their batsmen struggled against a strong England attack so that England was able to win all three Tests by an innings.
