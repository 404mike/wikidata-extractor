One theory is that Von Rundstedt and Hitler agreed to conserve the armour for Fall Rot (\"Case Red\"), an operation to the south. It is possible that the Luftwaffe's closer ties than the army's to the Nazi Party contributed to Hitler's approval of G\u00f6ring's request. Another theory\u2014which few historians have given credence\u2014is that Hitler was still trying to establish diplomatic peace with Britain before Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union). Although von Rundstedt after the war stated his suspicions that Hitler wanted \"to help the British\", based on alleged praise of the British Empire during a visit to his headquarters, little evidence that Hitler wanted to let the Allies escape exists apart from a self-exculpatory statement by Hitler himself in 1945.

He also criticises him for his lack of any realistic appraisal of the state of II Corps after Le Cateau,Senior (p. 336) argues that after Mons von Kluck seems to have thought the BEF a spent force; at Le Cateau II Corps fought bravely, but were saved largely by German lack of urgency, and thereafter by von Kluck's inability to catch the BEF up, not least as he believed wrongly that the British were retreating towards the Channel Ports.

In his start-of-year speeches to students, he stressed the need for administrative knowledge (\"the drudgery of staffwork\"), physical fitness (in his mid-forties, Wilson was still able to keep up with much younger officers at sport), imagination, \"sound judgement of men & affairs\" and \"constant reading & reflexion on the campaigns of the great masters\". Brian Bond argued (in The Victorian Army and the Staff College) that Wilson's \"School of Thought\" meant not just common training for staff officers but also espousal of conscription and the military commitment to send a BEF to France in the event of war. Keith Jeffery argues that this is a misunderstanding by Bond: there is no evidence in Wilson's writings to confirm that he meant the phrase in that way, although his political views were shared by many officers.Jeffery 2006, pp. 68\u201372.", "By 14 November 1912 the railway timetables, drawn up by Harper's MO1, were ready, after two years of work.

In the event the transport of the BEF from just three ports (Southampton for troops, Avonmouth for mechanical transport and Newhaven for stores) would proceed smoothly.

(1963) and the comedy television series Blackadder Goes Forth (1989) are two well-known works of popular culture, depicting the war as a matter of incompetent donkeys sending noble (or sometimes ignoble, in the case of Blackadder) lions to their doom. Such works are in the literary tradition of the war poets like Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and Erich Maria Remarque's novel (and subsequent film) All Quiet on the Western Front, which have been criticised by some historians, such as Brian Bond, for having given rise to what Bond considered the myth and conventional wisdom of the \"necessary and successful\" Great War as futile. Bond objected to the way that, in the 1960s, the works of Remarque and the \"Trench Poets\" slipped into a \"nasty caricature\" and perpetuated the \"myth\" of lions led by donkeys, while \"the more complicated true history of the war receded ... into the background\".", "Brian Bond, in editing a 1991 collection of essays on First World War history, expressed the collective desire of the authors to move beyond \"popular stereotypes of The Donkeys\", while acknowledging that serious leadership mistakes were made and that the authors would do little to rehabilitate the reputations of the senior commanders on the Somme. Hew Strachan quoted Maurice Genevoix for the proposition \"[i]f it is neither desirable nor good that the professional historian prevail over the veteran; it is also not good that the veteran prevail over the historian\" and then proceeded to take Liddell Hart to task for \"suppressing the culminating battles of the war\", thus \"allow[ing] his portrayal of British generals to assume an easy continuum, from incompetence on the Western Front to conservatism in the 1920s....\" While British leadership at the beginning of the war made costly mistakes, by 1915\u201316 the General Staff were making great efforts to lessen British casualties through better tactics (night attacks, creeping barrages and air power) and weapons technology (poison gas and later the arrival of the tank). British generals were not the only ones to make mistakes about the nature of modern conflict: the Russian armies too suffered badly during the first years of the war, most notably at the Battle of Tannenberg. German tactics are routinely criticised for involving the immediate counterattacking of lost ground, leading to lopsided losses in essentially defensive actions. To many generals who had fought colonial wars during the second half of the 19th century, where the Napoleonic concepts of discipline and pitched battles were still successful, fighting another highly industrialized power with equal and sometimes superior technology required an extreme change in thinking."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the University of London", "response": ["* Brian Bond (KCL)"]}, {"page": "Remilitarization of the Rhineland", "response": ["* Brian Bond. \"The Continental Commitment In British Strategy in the 1930s\" pp.\u00a0197\u2013208 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen and Lothar Kettenacker, London: George Allen & Unwin, 1983, ."]}, {"page": "Lees Knowles Lecture", "response": ["| 2000|| Prof. Brian Bond ||Britain and the First World War: The challenge to historians "]}]}}
