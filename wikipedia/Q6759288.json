He was sceptical about the new party, and scorned the likelihood that it could switch the allegiance of the working class from sport to politics. He persuaded the conference to adopt resolutions abolishing indirect taxation, and taxing unearned income \"to extinction\". Back in London, Shaw produced what Margaret Cole, in her Fabian history, terms a \"grand philippic\" against the minority Liberal administration that had taken power in 1892. To Your Tents, O Israel excoriated the government for ignoring social issues and concentrating solely on Irish Home Rule, a matter Shaw declared of no relevance to socialism. In 1894 the Fabian Society received a substantial bequest from a sympathiser, Henry Hunt Hutchinson\u2014Holroyd mentions \u00a310,000. Webb, who chaired the board of trustees appointed to supervise the legacy, proposed to use most of it to found a school of economics and politics. Shaw demurred; he thought such a venture was contrary to the specified purpose of the legacy. He was eventually persuaded to support the proposal, and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) opened in the summer of 1895.", "The substance of Shaw's political legacy is uncertain. In 1921 Shaw's erstwhile collaborator William Archer, in a letter to the playwright, wrote: \"I doubt if there is any case of a man so widely read, heard, seen, and known as yourself, who has produced so little effect on his generation.\" Margaret Cole, who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age, professed never to have understood him. She thought he worked \"immensely hard\" at politics, but essentially, she surmises, it was for fun\u2014\"the fun of a brilliant artist\". After Shaw's death, Pearson wrote: \"No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw.\""]}, {"page": "Hugh Gaitskell", "response": ["In 1927\u201328 Gaitskell lectured in economics for the Workers' Educational Association to miners in Nottinghamshire.

It is unclear whether Gaitskell was ever sympathetic to Oswald Mosley, then seen as a future leader of the Labour Party. Gaitskell's wife later insisted that he never had been, but Margaret Cole, Evan Durbin's wife and Noel Hall believed that he was, although as an opponent of factional splits he was not tempted to join Mosley's New Party in 1931.Williams 1985, p43"]}, {"page": "Beatrice Webb", "response": ["*Our Partnership by Beatrice Webb (1948), Longmans, Green & Co: London, New York, edited by Barbara Drake & Margaret Cole at the request of Sidney Webb.

By and large, the better known novelists such as Ngaio Marsh produced work that falls more squarely into the province of the traditional or \"cozy\" detective novel. Nevertheless, some of the work of authors less well known today, like Freeman Wills Crofts's novels about Inspector French or some of the work of the prolific team of G.D.H. and Margaret Cole, might be considered as the antecedents of today's police procedural. British mystery novelist and critic Julian Symons, in his 1972 history of crime fiction, Bloody Murder, labeled these proto-procedurals \"humdrums,\" because of their emphasis on the plodding nature of the investigators."]}, {"page": "Margaret Postgate", "response": ["#redirectMargaret Cole"]}, {"page": "John Percival Postgate", "response": ["He married his graduate student Edith Allen and they had six children among whom were Raymond Postgate (a journalist, historian, novelist and food writer), and Margaret Cole (a Fabian politician); he was grandfather to the animator and puppeteer Oliver Postgate, and the microbiologist John Postgate FRS (1922\u20132014), "]}, {"page": "Detection Club", "response": ["The Detection Club was formed in 1930 by a group of British mystery writers, including Agatha Christie, Dorothy L.
