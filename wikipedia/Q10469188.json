They had the majority of the early play and in the eleventh minute Alfred Gittins and P. Skilton took the ball past the United half backs before passing it onto Frank Cannon. He dribbled it towards goal and scored past Moger. After the goal, the United team improved but Skilton nearly scored twice more for Rangers. Just before half time, United had a chance when Billy Meredith played a ball on for Jimmy Turnbull but an injury to a QPR player stopped play. Charlie Roberts took the ball for United immediately afterwards and took it into the area, but was fouled with a penalty awarded. George Stacey stepped up to take the shot, but Charlie Shaw in goal for Rangers got a hand to the ball and saved it.", "|IR ||8 || Frank Cannon", "|IR ||8 || Frank Cannon"]}, {"page": "List of Port Vale F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Frank Cannon"]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["In 1909\u201310 the club won the North Staffordshire & District League, but lost key players such as Joe Brough (to Liverpool), Billy Cavenor (to Blackpool) and Bert Eardley (to Glossop). On 21 July 1911, the club re-organised, with J.H.Edwards elected chairman. The club also stepped up to the Central League. Facing another financial crisis, coupled with numerous issues with their Cobridge Ground, Vale transferred to The Old Recreation Ground in 1912, moving from Burslem to Hanley. This allowed the club to regular host over 10,000 spectators. At the end of the 1913\u201314 season, Vale agreed to stand down for re-election to the Football League, so that their stronger rivals Stoke would have a stronger chance of gaining re-election. It was understood that this favour would one day be repaid. In the meantime, former Stoke veteran and former England international Tom Holford was appointed as player-manager. The club ceased activities in 1914\u201315, in order not to hinder the war effort. During the war Frank Cannon was killed and Alf Smith was seriously wounded. In March 1919 the club failed to win re-election. However they returned to the Football League in October 1919, taking over the fixture list of Leeds City in the Second Division, who were disbanded because of financial irregularities."]}]}}
