Long-standing BBC visual effects designer Mat Irvine, who contributed visual effects to the series, received a brief cameo as a police diver in \"Breakthrough\".", "Although Kennedy Martin's notion for the serial was influenced by real political events, he had for a long time railed against naturalism in television drama \u2013 most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine Encore, titled \"Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television\", in which he sought \"to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera\".Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, p. 64 Edge of Darkness producer Michael Wearing has noted that \"there is a mystical dimension to Troy's imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic\".Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 104. Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within the realm of the mystical and the mythic.Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 112. Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day's interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma's ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh's The Real Camelot (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the Arthurian legend, saw Craven as a modern-day Green Man who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia. Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the Teutonic Knights who defended the borders of Eastern Europe, opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the Knights Templar who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial's conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a sniper and would be transformed into a tree."]}, {"page": "John Gray (philosopher)", "response": ["In 2002 Straw Dogs was named a book of the year by J.
