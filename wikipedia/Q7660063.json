It may have had common sails when built as the sale of a pair of sails is recorded in 1848, possibly indicating the fitting of a pair of spring sails. These sails were bought by the owner of the post mill at Brenzett. The mill may have been moved from Susan's Hill Farm, Woodchurch in 1852,  although two windmills were marked on the current site on the 1838 Tithe Map of Woodchurch.  During its working life, the mill was fitted with second hand millstones from the smock mill at Dymchurch and the post mill at Kennington. The sails on the mill when it stopped working in 1926 had previously been on High Halden post mill and before that Aldington smock mill. A  steam engine provided auxiliary power at one time. In 1946, the owner of the mill, Sir Sydney Nicholson, had the mill made weatherproof but plans for further repair and restoration were thwarted by his death the next year. Local villagers raised money for two new sails in 1957, but the cap was found to be unsafe shortly after and the sails had to be removed. By the late 1970s the mill was on the point of collapse, but a restoration programme was put in place and the mill was fully restored, and fitted with patent sails as the windshaft was found to be suitable for these. During its working life, the mill had spring sails. A complete new smock tower was built, and restoration completed in 1986.
