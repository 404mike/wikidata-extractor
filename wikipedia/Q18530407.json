After voluntary social work, seeking to improve the conditions of working women in deprived industrial areas, she joined the civil service in 1911, and became one of the first women in Britain to earn equal pay with her male colleagues. She left the civil service in 1919 and pursued a literary career. \nWilson is known for her scholarly work, including literary biographies of William Blake (1927) and Sir Philip Sidney (1931). Women writers of earlier generations were of particular interest to her, and she published two studies of 18th- and 19th-century female authors, including Jane Austen and 16 other women writers of the period (1924 and 1938)\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
