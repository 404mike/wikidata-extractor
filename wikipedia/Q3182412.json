For example, historian John Sadler states that there was no Lancastrian deception or ambush; York led his men from the castle on a foraging expedition (or by popular belief, to rescue some of his foragers who were under attack)Clark (2016), p. 230 and as successive Lancastrian contingents joined the battle (the last being Clifford's division, encamped south and east of Sandal Magna), York's army was outnumbered, surrounded and overwhelmed.Sadler (2011), p. 60"]}, {"page": "Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury", "response": ["On 24 August 1453, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, assembled a force of men-at-arms and archers perhaps as large as 1,000 strong, intending to waylay Salisbury and his family at Heworth Moor, outside York, as he made for Sheriff Hutton.  Salisbury had been attending the wedding of his son Thomas in Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, and although his escort would have been smaller, it would have been better armed than Egremont's York craftsmen and tradesmen. Salisbury and his retinue fought them back, arriving unscathed at Sheriff Hutton, but the episode marked the beginning of what was virtually a private war.  The bride, Maud Stanhope, was the widow of Lord Willoughby of Eresby, his son would become a Yorkist.  Another of the Yorkist party, John Neville, was later Lord Montagu.  Maud was due to inherit the manors of Wressle and Burwell from her uncle, Lord Cromwell, who had obtained them from the Percys through litigation.  Historian John Sadler argues this was the first incident in the Yorkist/Lancastrian affinities lawless squabble leading to civil war."]}, {"page": "Battle of Otterburn", "response": ["The Battle of Otterburn took place according to Scottish sources on 5 August 1388,Tom Steel, Scotland's Story, p 57, .The Hundred Years' War by Anne Curry, p 53, . or 19 August according to English sources,The English and Scottish Popular Ballads by Francis James Child, p 292, .Border Fury, England and Scotland at War 1296\u20131568 by John Sadler, p 275, . as part of the continuing border skirmishes between the Scots and English."]}, {"page": "John Sadler", "response": ["John Sadler may refer to:", "*John Sadler (town clerk) (1615\u20131674), English MP and Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge", "*John Sadler (1820\u20131910), English industrialist and public servant associated with Oldbury, West Midlands", "*John Sadler (cricketer) (born 1981), English cricketer", "*John Sadler (historian), British historian", "*John Sadler, inventor of transfer-printing", "*John Sadler, instigator of the Merchant's Hope plantation"]}, {"page": "George Stephenson High School", "response": ["* John Sadler (historian)"]}, {"page": "English invasion of Scotland (1400)", "response": ["John Sadler has described this expedition as 'like so many of its predecessors, fail[ing] to yield any significant results,' neither forcing the Scots onto a battlefield nor making any major territorial gains. Brown too has described the campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots did more damage to the English than had been done to them. Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies."]}, {"page": "Loveday, 1458", "response": ["Historians have noted multiple interpretations of the symbolism favoured by Henry. It was \"a symbolic series of gestures\", says John Sadler, perhaps a show of \"friendly and modest intimacies\" suggests Patricia Ingham. Or it may have been mere rhetoric, bordering on a charade, suggests Pollard. At the time, physical intimacy was an essential element of concord and the intention was clearly to demonstrate both their agreement and their willingness to agree. The Queen holding York's hand (rather than him holding Somerset's), says Watts, was an acknowledgement of her close involvement in the affairs of central government and her higher political profile in the post-St Albans body politic. The Loveday was a combination, says Griffiths, of \"elaborate ceremonial, royal prayer and example, monetary payments and the holding of hands...[between] bitter enemies\". The assembled lords were taking no more chances now than they had when they first arrived in London: Salisbury, for example, attended the concomitant religious ceremony at St Paul's with his retinue of 400 men, which included 80 knights and esquires, waiting in the churchyard. It may have been called a Loveday, comments Sadler, yet \"the title is ironic, as there was little of love in the air\". The closing event was the presentation of a new translation of the contemporary verse paraphrase, Knyghthode and Bataile to the King. This was a recent adaption of De re militari, and celebrates the martial exploits of the noble class in a classic chivalric form."]}]}}
