He also became an O.T.O. initiate, serving as the principal organizer for that order in British Columbia, Canada. He worked under a variety of mottos and acronymic titles, including V.I.O. (Unus in Omnibus, \"One in All,\" as an A\u2234A\u2234 Probationer), O.I.V.V.I.O., V.I.O.O.I.V., Parzival (as an Adeptus Minor and O.T.O. Ninth Degree), and Tantalus Leucocephalus (as Tenth Degree O.T.O.), but he is best known under his Neophyte motto \"Achad\" (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3\u200e, \"unity\"), which he used as a byline in his various published writings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleister Crowley", "response": ["In November 1907, Crowley and Jones decided to found an occult order to act as a successor to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, being aided in doing so by Fuller. The result was the A\u2234A\u2234. The group's headquarters and temple were situated at 124 Victoria Street in central London, and their rites borrowed much from those of the Golden Dawn, but with an added Thelemic basis. Its earliest members included solicitor Richard Noel Warren, artist Austin Osman Spare, Horace Sheridan-Bickers, author George Raffalovich, Francis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding, engineer Herbert Edward Inman, Kenneth Ward, and Charles Stansfeld Jones. In March 1909, Crowley began production of a biannual periodical titled The Equinox. He billed this periodical, which was to become the \"Official Organ\" of the A\u2234A\u2234, as \"The Review of Scientific Illuminism\".", "Crowley entered into a relationship with Jeanne Robert Foster, with whom he toured the West Coast. In Vancouver, headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with Charles Stansfeld Jones and Wilfred Talbot Smith to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent. In Detroit he experimented with Peyote at Parke-Davis, then visited Seattle, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, San Diego, Tijuana, and the Grand Canyon, before returning to New York. There he befriended Ananda Coomaraswamy and his wife Alice Richardson; Crowley and Richardson performed sex magic in April 1916, following which she became pregnant and then miscarried. Later that year he took a \"magical retirement\" to a cabin by Lake Pasquaney owned by Evangeline Adams. There, he made heavy use of drugs and undertook a ritual after which he proclaimed himself \"Master Therion\". He also wrote several short stories based on J.G. Frazer's The Golden Bough and a work of literary criticism, The Gospel According to Bernard Shaw."]}, {"page": "Thelema", "response": ["Aleister Crowley was highly prolific and wrote on the subject of Thelema for over 35 years, and many of his books remain in print.

Another lineage links itself to Crowley through Israel Regardie and his pupil Gerald Suster, claiming that Regardie joined the A\u2234A\u2234 when he became Crowley's secretary in 1928, but distanced himself from the organisation when the two men parted company four years later in 1932.Regardie (3rd ed. 1998) p. xv-xvii Other lineages run through Grady McMurtry and Charles Stansfeld Jones. There are also lineages descended from Frank Bennett and Rosaleen Norton operating in Australia.Richmond pp. 5-6, 15 There are also 'independent' A\u2234A\u2234 lineages that either don't descend from the pupils of Crowley or that choose not to declare their link. There presently exists no single undisputed central authority of the A\u2234A\u2234 such as existed under Crowley and Germer; nor has any surviving mechanism for the transference of such temporal authority been preserved down to the present day.

It included number of previously unpublished pieces in the Equinox series, including Liber LXV's commentary, and a colour reproduction of Crowley's illumination of Liber Pyramidos. Its main feature, Liber Cordis Cincte Serpente (Liber LXV) is considered to be one of the Holy Books of Thelema. It includes Crowley's commentary which, unlike in the earlier editions, was positioned opposite and facing the corresponding text of Liber LXV. Breeze's edition also includes other works of Crowley and shorter commentaries which have not been published before, including Charles Stansfeld Jones' commentary on Liber A'ash (written by him as an A\u2234A\u2234 assignment, and then annotated by Crowley), and other commentaries Breeze included to aid the aspirants within the system of the magical Order of the A\u2234A\u2234 in the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and the grade of Adeptus Minor. It contains reprinted documents important in defining the A\u2234A\u2234 training system, including Crowley's works such as One Star in Sight, Liber XIII, and Liber CLXXXV, to which this book adds An Account of the A\u2234A\u2234 introduced by Crowley's essay titled Occultism published for the first time, including one unpublished version of the A\u2234A\u2234 Student Examination. It also contains a large colour plate section including a colour reproduction of Crowley's original illuminated manuscript of Liber Pyramidos and paintings by J. F. C.

On May 10, 1921, Reuss issued X\u00b0 Charters to Charles Stansfeld Jones and Heinrich Tr\u00e4nker to serve as Grand Masters for the US and Germany, respectively. On July 30, 1921, Reuss issued another \"Gauge of Amity\" document, this time to H. Spencer Lewis, founder of A.M.O.R.C., the San Jose, California based Rosicrucian organization.

In a diary entry for November 27, 1921, Crowley wrote: \"I have proclaimed myself O.H.O. Frater Superior of the Order of Oriental Templars.\" Reuss died on October 28, 1923. In a letter to Heinrich Tr\u00e4nker dated February 14, 1925, Crowley stated the following: \"Reuss was very uncertain in temper, and in many ways unreliable. In his last years he seems to have completely lost his grip, even accusing The Book of the Law of communistic tendencies, than which no statement could be more absurd. Yet it seems that he must have been to some extent correctly led, on account of his having made the appointments of yourself and Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones), and designating me in his last letter as his successor.\" In a letter to Charles Stansfeld Jones dated Sun in Capricorn, Anno XX (Dec. 1924 - Jan. 1925), Crowley said, \"in the O.H.O.'s last letter to me he invited me to become his successor as O.H.O. and Frater Superior.\" Reuss's letter designating Crowley his successor as O.H.O. has not been found, but no credible documentation has surfaced which would indicate that Reuss ever designated any alternative successor."]}, {"page": "Frater Achad", "response": ["#redirect Charles Stansfeld Jones "]}]}}
