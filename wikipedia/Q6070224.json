Loveridge (10 April 1917 \u2013 6 November 2000) was an English classical pianist.\nBorn in West Ham, Essex, she attended the Royal College of Music, and later the Royal Academy. She specialised in British contemporary music, including piano sonatas by Arnold Bax, Gordon Jacob (of which she was the dedicatee), E. J. Moeran and Edmund Rubbra. In 1947 she also gave the UK premiere of William Schuman's Piano Concerto with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Basil Cameron. She also performed in duet with the oboist Evelyn Rothwell (Lady Barbirolli). In addition, she made appearances at the Henry Wood Proms. She retired professionally in 1995.\nHer recordings of Bax's piano works (not quite a complete survey of his piano output, though most of his pieces for the instrument are represented) were recently re-issued on CD by Lyrita Records.\nShe married Henry Morriss in 1966, but continued to perform under her maiden name.  Henry died in 1995.  Iris Loveridge died in Gloucester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arnold Bax", "response": ["Parlett included an extensive discography in his 1999 A Catalogue of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax,Parlett, Appendix 3 later expanded and updated in a website.

Bax's chamber music is well represented on disc, with recordings of most of the works, and multiple versions of many, including the Elegiac Trio, the Clarinet Sonata and the Fantasy Sonata. Much of the piano music has been recorded by pianists including Iris Loveridge, John McCabe, Ashley Wass and Michael Endres, though by 2015 no integral survey had yet been recorded. Of the vocal works, by far the most often recorded is Mater ora Filium, but other choral works, and a representative selection of the songs are on disc."]}, {"page": "Lady Eleanor Holles School", "response": ["* Iris Loveridge, concert pianist"]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists", "response": ["* Iris Loveridge"]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists (recorded)", "response": ["* Iris Loveridge"]}, {"page": "Evelyn Barbirolli", "response": ["Rothwell married John Barbirolli in 1939, after his divorce from his first wife. By this time Barbirolli was conductor of the New York Philharmonic, where he had succeeded Arturo Toscanini in 1936. Barbirolli and Rothwell lived in New York until 1943, when they returned to England so Barbirolli could take over the conductorship of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, based in Manchester. Rothwell occasionally played in the orchestra, although she kept her appearances there to a minimum to avoid charges of nepotism. When the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra performed in Salzburg in 1948, she was the soloist in the first performance of Mozart's Oboe Concerto, K. 314 since its rediscovery and republication.
