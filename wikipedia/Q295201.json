One of the sport's most accomplished players, he dominated professional snooker during the 1990s, when he won the World Snooker Championship seven times, a record in the modern era, surpassing the six world titles previously achieved by both Ray Reardon and Steve Davis. He is snooker's youngest world champion, having won his first world title in 1990, aged 21.In addition to his seven world titles, Hendry has won six Masters titles and five UK Championship titles for 18 Triple Crown tournament wins, a total surpassed only by Ronnie O'Sullivan's 20. He won five consecutive Masters titles between 1989 and 1993, and five consecutive world titles between 1992 and 1996, both records in the modern era. One of three players to have won all three Triple Crown events in a single season, he is the only player to have achieved the feat twice, in the 1989\u201390 and 1995\u201396 seasons. His 36 ranking titles are second only to O'Sullivan's 38, and his nine seasons as world number one set a record under the annual ranking system used until 2010. A prolific break builder, Hendry has recorded 776 career century breaks. He has made 11 officially recognised maximum breaks in professional competition, surpassed only by O'Sullivan's 15 and John Higgins's 12.\nAwarded an MBE in 1994, Hendry was voted BBC Scotland's Sports Personality of the Year in 1987 and 1996. In May 2012, after appearing in his 27th consecutive World Championship, he retired from professional snooker, ending his record 23 consecutive seasons in the top 16 of the world rankings. Hendry made his decision in response to a severe loss of form caused by \"the yips\", a condition that had first affected his game 12 years previously. In September 2020, citing improvements in his play, Hendry announced that he would come out of retirement and accept an invitational tour card for the next two seasons. After an almost nine-year absence from the tour, he returned to professional competition at the Gibraltar Open in March 2021, but as of January 2022 his best result since his return has been reaching the second round of one ranking event.

In a match marred by erratic refereeing and a sub-standard table, Reardon nevertheless pulled away to win the title for the fifth time, with the score finishing at 27\u201316.

He spent 21 seasons ranked in snooker's elite top 16. In team events, he won the Nations Cup and the World Cup with England. He is one of a select number of players to have made over 300 century breaks in professional competition.

However he proved no match for Stephen Hendry in the final, and Hendry's century break in his first visit to the table proved portentous, as White was beaten 18\u20135 with a session to spare.

After qualifying to play Stephen Hendry in the first round, White opened with a century break and uncharacteristically shrewd matchplay enabled him to open up a 7\u20130 lead with only one further break over 50. Despite losing the next three frames from winning positions, White was able to seal a memorable 10\u20134 success and became the first player to beat Hendry twice at the World Championship. White followed this with a 13\u20133 win over Darren Morgan which included a break of 144. In his quarter-final against Ronnie O'Sullivan, however, White reverted to his more familiar all-out attacking style and lost the first session 1\u20137.
