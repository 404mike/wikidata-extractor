Manuel was caught and beaten by Bolivian officials, leading to his death, but Ledger obtained seeds of high quality. These seeds were offered to the British, who were uninterested, leading to the rest being sold to the Dutch. The Dutch saw their value and multiplied the stock. The species later named Cinchona ledgeriana yielded 8 to 13 percent quinine in bark grown in Dutch Indonesia, which effectively out-competed the British Indian production. It was only later that the English saw the value and sought to obtain the seeds of C. ledgeriana from the Dutch."]}, {"page": "History of malaria", "response": ["An English trader, Charles Ledger, and his Amerindian servant spent four years collecting cinchona seeds in the Andes in Bolivia, highly prized for their quinine but whose export was prohibited.
