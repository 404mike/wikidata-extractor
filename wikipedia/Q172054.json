The Vanwall VW11 did not re-appear: Tony Brooks going back to his BRP Cooper and with both Scarabs having blown up at Reims they were not present although Chuck Daigh and Lance Reventlow shared a third factory Cooper, Daigh being faster and thus getting to race. Aston Martin showed up with DBR5s for Roy Salvadori and Maurice Trintignant while motorcycle ace John Surtees re-appeared in a works Lotus and there was the usual crop of British privateers including Keith Greene in the Gilby Engineering Cooper-Maserati and Brian Naylor in his JBW-Maserati. Qualifying resulted in pole position for Jack Brabham, a second faster than Graham Hill's BRM with Bruce McLaren's Cooper and Jo Bonnier's BRM making it a balanced front row. The start saw three cars stall: Graham Hill (his second race running) and the two BRP Coopers of Brooks and Henry Taylor. McLaren was second on the first lap but soon dropped behind Bonnier and the factory Lotus of Innes Ireland. Ireland then passed Bonnier to take second place. Graham Hill drove a storming race from the back of the field and worked his way back, passing Ireland for second after 37 laps and setting off after Brabham. To the delight of the crowd, he caught him and on lap 55 took the lead. Further back Surtees displaced Ireland in third place. Hill had been suffering brake problems for some time and on lap 72, he spun at Copse Corner and was out.

To achieve this Fred Wilkinson constructed a car \u2014 the JBW Type 1 \u2014 that was strongly influenced by the contemporary Cooper designs, and carried its Maserati  engine behind the driver. The first appearance of the JBW-Maserati was at the pre-season BRDC International Trophy non-Championship race at Silverstone, on 2 May 1959. Naylor arrived too late to post a qualifying time, and retired on lap 41 of the race with gearbox failure. On 18 July Naylor appeared in the JBW car at the 1959 British Grand Prix at Aintree. Although he managed to qualify ahead of such well known drivers as Tony Brooks, Jack Fairman and Ivor Bueb, again the JBW let Naylor down and the car's transmission failed on lap 18. One final outing that year resulted in a failure even to qualify, after Naylor suffered an accident during practice for the Gold Cup race at Oulton Park on 26 September.", "The JBW Type 1 did not appear again until the following year's International Trophy race, on 14 May 1960. While Naylor and the JBW-Maserati qualified in 25th and last place, by the finish he had worked his way up to 11th position, the car lasting the distance for the first time in a competitive event. Unfortunately for Naylor, the first race of the  World Championship season, the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix, was not to provide such positive results and he once again failed to qualify. However, his next race, the 1960 British Grand Prix provided Brian Naylor with his best ever Championship finish, after he came home in 13th place, having qualified in 18th place. His run of form continued at the Brands Hatch Silver City Trophy event on 1 August, where he finished 11th. Things appeared even to be looking up for the JBW team when Naylor qualified the JBW-Maserati in 7th position for the 1960 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, but his luck had begun to change and the car's gearbox failed on the 42nd lap. One further World Championship race (in the USA) and two non-Championship events in the remainder of the 1960 season all resulted in early retirements.", "|align=\"left\"|  Brian Naylor", "|align=\"left\"|  Brian Naylor", "|align=\"left\"|  Brian Naylor", "|align=\"left\"|  Brian Naylor", "|align=\"left\"|  Brian Naylor"]}, {"page": "Graham Whitehead", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Brian Naylor"]}, {"page": "1959 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["As in the previous year, Aston Martin arrived with victory in the 1000km of N\u00fcrburgring with their DBR1/300.
