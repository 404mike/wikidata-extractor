A veteran of World War I, he served in the 7th battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers after enlisting at the age of just 16. He took part in operations in Turkey, where he was awarded the Serbian Gold medal for his actions in saving a Serbian officer, and Palestine.On his return to Britain, Beadles played amateur football for his local side Newtown and Liverpool based side Grayson's before being spotted by First Division side Liverpool, where he was part of consecutive First Division title winning sides in 1921\u201322 and 1922\u201323. However, he struggled to establish himself in the first team, making 18 appearances during his 3 seasons at Anfield. He joined Cardiff City in August 1924 where he spent less than two seasons, including playing in the 1925 FA Cup Final, before being sold to Sheffield Wednesday in an attempt to raise funds as the club experienced financial difficulties.Beadles never played a senior game for the first-team with Wednesday and he later finished his career with spells at Southport, where he was the club's top scorer for three consecutive seasons in the Third Division North, and Irish side Dundalk, where he served as player-manager. During his career, he made over 100 appearances in the Football League and won 2 caps for Wales in 1925.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newtown, Powys", "response": ["*Harry Beadles (1897\u20131958), Welsh international footballer, born in Llanllwchaiarn, near Newtown"]}, {"page": "Dundalk F.C.", "response": ["*1929\u20131930: Harry Beadles"]}, {"page": "1958 in Wales", "response": ["*29 August \u2013 Harry Beadles, international footballer, 60"]}, {"page": "George Latham (footballer)", "response": ["It was during his service in the First World War that Latham first met his longtime friend Harry Beadles.

He instead returned to his home town Newtown where he died three years later in July 1939 at Montgomery County Infirmary at the age of 58.

In the final minute, Willie Davies scored directly from a corner to send Cardiff through with a 2\u20131 win. This was the first season in English football that a new law allowed players to score direct from a corner kick. Davies was mobbed by supporters following the goal, but there remained confusion among other members of the crowd and Davies, along with teammate Jimmy Blair, was forced to return to the field from the dressing room after the match to confirm to the crowd that Cardiff had won the tie.", "Cardiff started the opening minutes of the second half more assertively but failed to capitalise on their brief ascendancy. Their most promising move of these early stages was ended when Harry Beadles was flagged offside. The best chance of the second half fell to United whose forward line had advanced on the Cardiff goal \"practically unhampered\". As the ball was sent across the Cardiff penalty area, three United players took misplaced swipes at the ball and failed to convert for a second goal. Cardiff's attempts to control the game were limited due to an apparent injury to Hardy that left him struggling to keep pace. Johnson sent a strong shot towards the Cardiff goal 15 minutes into the second half which Nelson blocked. The Sunday Pictorial described the two sides in the second half as \"working hard without having, apparently, any definite aim in view\".", "|FW || Harry Beadles"]}, {"page": "1897 in Wales", "response": ["*28 September \u2013 Harry Beadles, Wales international footballer (died 1958)"]}, {"page": "Joe Clennell", "response": ["Clennell was born in New Silksworth and began his career with Blackpool in 1910. He was top scorer for the Seasiders in 1910\u201311 scoring 19 goals which attracted the attention of First Division clubs. Blackburn Rovers signed him in April 1911 and in his first full season at Ewood Park he won a First Division champions medal. Injuries restricted him to few appearances for Rovers and he joined Everton in January 1914 when he again won a First Division in 1914\u201315 where Clennell scored 14 goals. His career was interrupted by World War I but he resumed playing for Everton in 1919. He spent two more seasons at Goodison Park before leaving for Cardiff City in October. He was a very useful forward for the Bluebirds and very nearly helped them win the title in 1923\u201324 but they missed out to Huddersfield Town on goal average. After losing his place to Harry Beadles, he then played two seasons for Stoke City scoring 9 goals in 35 matches and ended his career with Bristol Rovers and then Rochdale."]}, {"page": "1922 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||10|| Harry Beadles"]}, {"page": "List of Southport F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Harry Beadles", "| Harry Beadles", "| Harry Beadles"]}]}}
