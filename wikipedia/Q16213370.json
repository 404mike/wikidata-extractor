He initially rose to prominence in the 1990s as a big beat DJ. However, as his career progressed both his productions and his DJ sets became known for including a variety of musical styles. From 2004 onwards, he began to scale back his DJing due to tinnitus, but simultaneously launched a second career as a businessman, co-founding a company that runs a chain of live music pubs across London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Oakenfold", "response": ["In 2002, Oakenfold remixed David Arnold's \"James Bond Theme\", the song was released under Warner Bros.
