In Paris, at a banquet held in his honor on April 4, 1859, a laurel wreath was placed over the head of a bust of Morphy, carved by the sculptor Eug\u00e8ne-Louis Lequesne. Morphy was declared by the assembly \"the best chess player that ever lived.\" At a similar gathering in London, where he returned in the spring of 1859, Morphy was again proclaimed \"the Champion of the World\". He was also invited to a private audience with Queen Victoria. So dominant was Morphy that even masters could not seriously challenge him in play without some kind of handicap. At a simultaneous match against five masters, Morphy won two games against Jules Arnous de Rivi\u00e8re and Henry Edward Bird, drew two games with Samuel Boden and Johann Jacob L\u00f6wenthal, and lost one to Thomas Wilson Barnes.G\u00e9za Mar\u00f3czy, Paul Morphy.
