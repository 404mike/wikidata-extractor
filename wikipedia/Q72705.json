This regret that Adams did not speak is echoed in Devlin's more legalistic comment that a \"not guilty\" verdict does not usually mean the accused has established their innocence, but that there is doubt about guilt. Adams had been accused of three murders, indicted on two counts and had a trial and been found not guilty of one of these, but by widely publicised innuendo, he had been implicated in many more. The only way that Adams could have challenged these suspicions would have been to give evidence to explain his actions, and to accept being cross-examined.Devlin, pp. 144, 197."]}, {"page": "Carroll & Graf Publishers", "response": ["* Sybille Bedford"]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: Ba\u2013Bh", "response": ["| Sybille Bedford", "| BBarrow, Andrew (23 May 2004), Sybille Bedford: Secret history , The Independent Retrieved 17 November 2006."]}, {"page": "Jacqueline Wheldon", "response": ["In 1980, she was asked to become Director of the UK branch of the Committee for the Free World, an organisation of intellectuals unified by a desire to stiffen the sinews of western resistance to communism, to argue against unilateral nuclear disarmament by the West, and to press for the installation of cruise missiles in Western Europe (in response to the communist deployment of SS-20 nuclear missiles in Eastern Europe).
