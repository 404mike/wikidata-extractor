The story follows a journalist couple who invite a man and woman, Mr & Mrs Blair, into their idyllic village home. The film also stars Mickey Sumner, Ruben Crow, Regan Elizabeth Brown, Dave Mounfield and Aaron Davis. Pearson received critical acclaim by critics for her performance as Mrs. Blair. William of All Horror spoke most highly of Pearson's performance as Mrs. Blair, with him writing, \"[Pearson] deserves some kind of award for her nearly wordless, but not silent performance. She lets the audience know with her eyes and grunts that this skin-suit is barely containing some other life-form that is dying to tear you apart, but cannot until she gets these irritating photographs from the couple.\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also spoke highly of such a thing, in which he stated: \"[...] Caught delivers plenty of terrifying moments, thanks to the highly committed performances by the central quartet [...]\". Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times noted praise of the performances, remarking that \"Caught hits the usual beats, but with an unusually strong cast and original characters.\" Jeannette Catsoulis praised the cast, in her review for The New York Times, by stating \"As played by [Barry] and [Pearson] [...], the interlopers are a weird, disgusting delight, easily dominating the movie and their ineffectual hosts.\" Bobby LePire of Film Threat Bobby LePire wrote, \"What cannot be overlooked is the animalistic qualities of Mrs. Blair.\", in which he later concludes that \"[...] the acting serves the unnerving atmosphere perfectly [...]\". Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting acclaimed the performances of Barry and Pearson, with Miska stating, \"There's plenty of tension, with the performances by [Barry] and [Pearson] carrying the entire film on their backs, not to mention an escalation of terror [...]\". Mike Sprague of JoBlo.com praised Pearson's characterisation, in which he wrote, \"[Pearson's] arc throughout the movie is my favorite thing about the piece, and I'm sure it will be yours as well.\" Film at Lincoln Center described both Barry and Pearson's Mr and Mrs. Blair as being \"played perfectly\"."]}]}}
