He saw the move as a fresh start away from the racist abuse he had received at Chelsea, and he was more respected at Reading due to his experience in the First Division. However, he ruptured his cruciate ligament in a clash with Sunderland's Dave Swindlehurst at Roker Park on 21 October and was ruled out for the rest of the 1986\u201387 season. After ten months of recovery he was fit enough to be included in manager Ian Branfoot's first team plans for the 1987\u201388 season. He scored in a 3\u20130 win against Oldham Athletic at Elm Park but his knee caused him to leave the game after 65 minutes. He went on to feature a total of eight times that season, including in a League Cup win over former club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, but was never able to fully regain match fitness. In November 1987 his knee gave way again and Canoville announced his retirement from professional football."]}, {"page": "Template talk:WikiProject Biography/Missing", "response": ["*Dave Swindlehurst"]}, {"page": "List of foreign football players in Cypriot First Division", "response": ["*Dave Swindlehurst \u2013 Anorthosis Famagusta FC (1985\u20131986)"]}, {"page": "History of Derby County F.C.

Against a background of turmoil, with various changes of chairman and a police investigation into alleged boardroom corruption during the summer of 1979, Derby could only record a finish of 21st out of 22 teams, 5 points from safety and exited the top flight after 11 years and 2 titles with a whimper.", "Derby's first second tier fixture for 11 years saw them crash 3\u20130 at Cambridge United but 4 wins in their next 5 matches boded well.

Although shorn of the star names of the previous decade, Derby had the ever consistent Steve Buckley in the ranks, alongside a striking combination of Alan Biley and Dave Swindlehurst, who both broke double figures for the season, as well as the experience of McFarland and Steve Powell. However, despite a promising middle part of the season, the club fell away badly in the final third and recorded just 4 wins from its last 15 fixtures to finish the season in 6th, 22 points behind Champions West Ham United.
