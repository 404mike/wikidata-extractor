Musically, \"Brave\" is a mid-tempo disco song, influenced by heavy elements of electronic dance music.

Alex Young from Consequence of Sound noted elements of tribal house and 1970s music, \"that reinforces some of the good impact nostalgia has on today's musical landscape\". Writing for BBC Music, Sarah Bee said it was the most \"Madonna-esque track here\". Writing for the online music blog MuuMuse, Bradley Stern said that the song \"finds Kelis taking on her divorce, pregnancy, and various other inner demons in a rave-happy, carnal explosion of noisy synthesizers and grinding electronica.\" Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe identified elements of eurodisco in the songs' compositions.
