He was the author of three books on Shakespeare, including The Shakespearean Ethic (1959), and two on the origins of anti-vivisection activism, In Pity and in Anger: A Study of the Use of Animals in Science (1969) \u2013 which documents the disputes between Frances Power Cobbe and Anna Kingsford, two prominent 19th-century British activists \u2013 and The Dark Face of Science (1971).
