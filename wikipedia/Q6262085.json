Originally trained as an archeologist, he worked with Sir Flinders Petrie in the Middle East. Vyvyan became known for his study of Shakespeare and his histories of the animal rights movement. He was the author of three books on Shakespeare, including The Shakespearean Ethic (1959), and two on the origins of anti-vivisection activism, In Pity and in Anger: A Study of the Use of Animals in Science (1969) \u2013 which documents the disputes between Frances Power Cobbe and Anna Kingsford, two prominent 19th-century British activists \u2013 and The Dark Face of Science (1971). In recognition of his contribution to Shakespearean scholarship in his trilogy, he was offered, but unable to take up, a visiting lectureship at the State University of New York. He died in Exmouth in 1975.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of animal rights advocates", "response": ["!John Vyvyan"]}, {"page": "John Vivian", "response": ["John Vivian (or John Vyvyan) may refer to:", "*John Vyvyan (1908\u20131975), writer on animal rights", "*Johnny Vyvyan (John Vyvyan, 1924\u20131984), Australian-born actor, appeared in Hancock's Half Hour and other British series"]}, {"page": "Vyvyan, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Vyvyan"]}]}}
