Verifying research into its location in ancient text proved difficult for Fellows, with illegible Greek inscriptions providing the sole written source at the site. However, Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt details in his 1847 work Travels in Lycia that validation is provided in the words of Pliny the Elder, who places Phellus north of Habessus (Antiphellus' pre-Hellenic name).", "An expedition to the Lycian region under the guidance of Vice-Admiral Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt was to follow. The group set about continuing the work of Hoskyn and his assistant, W.S. Harvey in the restoration of the archaeological sites discovered by Sir Charles Fellows, with work commencing on recently rediscovered settlements such as Rhodiapolis, Candyba, and indeed, Phellus (among other locations). Though Phellus had already been uncovered by Fellows, Spratt also wanted to charter and survey the site, consulting the works of Roman scholars Livy and Pliny the Elder in order to verify the location of the ruins; citing Livy's claim of a town near Phoenicus that acted as \"the port of Phellus\",Livy (1836), p. 296 and Pliny the Elder's writings, which suggest that Phellus is directly north of Habessus, a pre-Hellenic name for the settlement's trading port, Antiphellus. Using these clues, Spratt journeyed to the small farming village of Saaret, which is North north-west of Antiphellus in order to locate the ruins of Phellus.Spratt (1847), p. 59 He was accompanied by the same guide Charles Fellows had used to document the settlement for reliability purposes, who was named Pagniotti. If his cartography had been correct, Spratt could verify Phellus' location through a correlation of the ancient texts and the site notes taken by Fellows; especially toward remarks of its close proximity and adjacency to the Island of Megiste.Spratt (1847), p. 58"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt||05/06/1856||11 May 1811 \u2013 10 March 1888"]}, {"page": "Thomas Graves (naturalist)", "response": ["thumb|Admiralty Chart No 53 Lough Neagh surveyed and sounded by Lieut.
