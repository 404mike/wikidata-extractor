Determined to become a chef, his father secured the 12-year-old Sommerin's first Saturday job in an Italian restaurant in the hope of dissuading his son from getting into the industry, but the job only served to convince Sommerin of his vocation.After school he undertook formal cookery training. Sommerin's first full-time job cooking was as a commis chef at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, Llangybi.\nThen, aged 16, he headed to the Farleyer House Hotel in Aberfeldy, Scotland, where he trained further under Richard Lyth, who gave him his under-stated French style.Returning to Wales to be closer to his family, Sommerin joined The Crown at Whitebrook, Monmouthshire in 2000 as Sous Chef. In December 2003 he became Executive Chef. Under his control, The Crown at Whitebrook gained a Michelin star in 2007, which it retained for seven years until, due to financial difficulties, The Crown at Whitebrook ceased trading in March 2013.Having been selected as one of the Chefs to Watch in 2008 by The Guardian, Sommerin represented Wales in the 2009 final of the BBC's Great British Menu, having beaten Stephen Terry.Married to Louise, the couple live in Penarth and have three daughters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*James Sommerin (born c. 1978), chef"]}, {"page": "Caerleon", "response": ["* James Sommerin, chef"]}, {"page": "Great British Menu", "response": ["*Wales: Angela Hartnett, Chris Chown, Stephen Terry and James Sommerin", "*Wales: James Sommerin (won heat) vs Stephen TerryBryn Williams as mentor", "| Wales || Aled Williams || James Sommerin || Richard Davies || Stephen Terry", "| Wales || Stephen Terry || James Sommerin || Richard Davies || Angela Hartnett"]}, {"page": "Stephen Terry", "response": ["Terry is mostly known for stints on the BBC programme representing Wales in Great British Menu.
