She lived in Station Road, Hirwaun, and was obliged to leave school at the age of twelve, in order to help at home. Ten years later, a letter she wrote to the press in support of Evan Roberts gained her some attention, and she joined the women's suffrage movement at about the same time. She was one of three women who gave evidence before the Sankey Commission in 1918, speaking before the House of Lords, along with two miners' wives.As soon as women received the vote, the Labour Party appointed four female organisers, of whom Andrews was one. She campaigned tirelessly for health and education services. One of her great successes was the opening of the first nursery school in Wales in the Rhondda in 1938.  \nShe was awarded the OBE in 1948 for her services as a JP in Ystrad Rhondda.\nIn 2004, she came 100th in the on-line poll to find 100 Welsh Heroes with a total of 37 votes. In 2006 her book A Woman's Work is Never Done, originally printed in 1952, was reprinted following a revival in her work by Glenys Kinnock. Andrews was one of five women shortlisted in 2018 for the first statue of a woman to be erected in Cardiff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhondda", "response": ["With an economy largely dependent on a single industry, there was a scarcity of jobs for women in Rhondda's coalmining heyday. The Encyclopaedia of Wales notes that the image of the Welsh Mam, a wife and mother constantly at home and exalted as the queen of the household, was essentially a Rhondda creation. However the Rhondda did produce the suffragette and social reformer Elizabeth Andrews, one of only nine women among a list of a hundred great Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.100 Welsh Heroes Ranked at number 100."]}, {"page": "Andrews (surname)", "response": ["* Elizabeth Andrews (1882\u20131960), Labour Party organiser in Wales"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Andrews (disambiguation)", "response": ["Elizabeth Andrews may refer to:", "*Elizabeth Andrews (1882\u20131960), first woman organiser of the Labour Party in Wales", "*Elizabeth Andrews (rugby player), Australian rugby player"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Smith", "response": ["*Elizabeth Andrews (1882\u20131960), n\u00e9e Smith, Welsh Labour Party politician, writer, and suffragist"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth (given name)", "response": ["* Elizabeth Andrews (1882\u20131960), first woman organiser of the Labour Party in Wales"]}, {"page": "Andrews, Elizabeth", "response": ["#redirectElizabeth Andrews"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Elizabeth Andrews (1882\u20131960), suffragist, writer"]}, {"page": "Women's suffrage in Wales", "response": ["By 1914 the non-militant elements of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school had been set up by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given. In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews."]}, {"page": "Betty Campbell", "response": ["Race Council Cymru immediately called for a statue to be erected in her memory. In Cardiff, the only statue of a woman who actually lived was that of Boudicca in the City Hall. This contrasted with the number of statues of famous men, including Aneurin Bevan, Ivor Novello and Lloyd George. In 2016, Helen Molyneux (the Chair of the Institute of Welsh Affairs), Carolyn Hitt, and the Welsh Women's Equality Network, organised 'Monumental Welsh Women', a task force to tackle this imbalance. In 2019, the BBC ran the 'Hidden Heroines' campaign to decide who should be the subject of Cardiff's first statue of a named woman, decided by a public vote. Five women were shortlisted: the poet and teacher Cranogwen (Sarah Jane Rees), the suffragette Lady Rhondda (Margaret Haig Thomas), the political organiser Elizabeth Andrews, the writer and anthropologist Elaine Morgan, and Betty Campbell."]}]}}
