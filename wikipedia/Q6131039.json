For fourteen years, he acted as organising secretary for the Scottish Independent Labour Party (ILP). He served on Glasgow Town Council 1939\u201346.\nHe was elected for Glasgow Bridgeton at a by-election in 1946, following the death of James Maxton, leader of the ILP.  He was the ILP candidate, and he narrowly beat the Labour Party candidate to win the by-election.  However this by-election was the ILP's \"swan song\"; he and the two other ILP MPs defected to the Labour Party at various times in 1947 and it ceased to be a serious electoral force after this.\nCarmichael retired as an MP in 1961.  The by-election to replace him was won by Labour, but it was one of the first elections where the Scottish National Party (SNP) won a significant vote, heralding further advances in the 1960s.\nHis son was Neil Carmichael, who was also a Glasgow Labour MP for several years, and was later created a life peer as Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove. His son-in-law was Labour MP Hugh Brown.Carmichael died at a hospital in Dumfries, aged 72.", "link_mentions": {}}}
