For this earliest phase of the theatre there is the work of Aeschylus, who flourished in the 480-460s. The dramatic action of the plays does point to the presence of a skene or background scenery of some description, the strongest evidence of which is from the Oresteia that requires a number of entrances and exits from a palace door.O. Taplin, The Stagecraft of Aeschylus, Oxford, 1977, p.459 Whether this was a temporary or permanent wooden structure or simply a tent remains unclear since there is no physical evidence for a skene building until the Periclean phase.C. Papastamati-von Moock, The Wooden Theatre of Dionysos Eleuthereus in Athens, in R. Frederiksen et al, The Architecture of the Ancient Greek Theatre, 2015. However, the hypothesis of a skene is not contradicted by the known archaeology of the site. The Oresteia also refers to a roof from which a watchman looks out, a step to the palace and an altar.O. Taplin, The Stagecraft of Aeschylus, Oxford, 1977, Appendix B, for a description of the stage resources. It is sometimes argued that an ekkyklema,  a wheeled trolly, was used for the revelation of the bodies by Clytemnestra at line 1372 in Agamemnon amongst other passages.  If so it was an innovation of Aeschylus' stagecraft. However, Oliver Taplin questions the seemingly inconsistent use of the device for the dramatic passages claimed for it, and doubts whether the mechanism existed in Aeschylus' lifetime.O.

By 1967, 185 of these vases had been identified.Trendall, Phlyax Vases, 1967. Since depictions of theatre and especially comedy are rare in fabrics other than the South Italian, these have been thought to portray the distinctly local theatre tradition.This argument was first made by H Heydemann in Die Phlyakendarstellungen der bemalten Vasen of 1886. Scholarship of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, in particular the work of Oliver Taplin, has cast doubt on this ascription of the vases to the phlyakes seeing them instead as depictions of Attic Old Comedy. The vases first appeared at the end of the 5th century BCE, but most are 4th century. They represent grotesque characters, the masks of comedy, and the props of comic performance such as ladders, baskets, and open windows. About a quarter of them depict a low wooden temporary stage, but whether this was used in reality is a point of contention.Margarete Bieber, The History of Greek and Roman Theater, 1961, p.146, takes a rather literal reading of this whereas W. Beare, The Roman Stage, 1964, insists this is a matter of the painter\u2019s interpretation.", "*Oliver Taplin.

A language is not merely a collection of words and of rules of grammar and syntax for generating sentences, but also a vast interconnecting system of connotations and cultural references whose mastery, writes linguist Mario Pei, \"comes close to being a lifetime job.\"Mario Pei, The Story of Language, p. 424. The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator\u2014after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures\u2014may require a minimum of ten years' experience. Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them. Emily Wilson, a professor of classical studies at the University of Pennsylvania and herself a translator, writes: \"[I]t is [hard] to produce a good literary translation. This is certainly true of translations of ancient Greek and Roman texts, but it is also true of literary translation in general: it is very difficult. Most readers of foreign languages are not translators; most writers are not translators. Translators have to read and write at the same time, as if always playing multiple instruments in a one-person band. And most one-person bands do not sound very good.\"Emily Wilson, \"Ah, how miserable!\" (review of three separate translations of The Oresteia by Aeschylus: by Oliver Taplin, Liveright, November 2018; by Jeffrey Scott Bernstein, Carcanet, April 2020; and by David Mulroy, Wisconsin, April 2018), London Review of Books, vol. 42, no. 19 (8 October 2020), pp. 9\u201312, 14.
