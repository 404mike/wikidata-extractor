He moved to the United States where he served as a professor of pathology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nGibbes was born in Berrow, Somerset, where his namesake father was a minister while his mother Margaretta was the daughter of John Murray, an admiral in the Royal Navy. His paternal great-grandfather, Sir George Smith Gibbes (1771\u20131851) was physician extraordinary to Queen Charlotte while his maternal grandfather John Murray was an Admiral in the Royal Navy. At the age of fourteen, he rebelled against his father's plan to train for the clergy, and he left home to sail to the East Indies and returned only at the age of twenty one. He then studied under private tutors and went to the University of Aberdeen. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1879 and in 1887 he became Professor of Physiology and Normal and Morbid Histology at Westminster Hospital Medical School. He was a curator of the anatomical museum at King's College. He was a student of Emanuel Edward Klein and in 1884, the two were appointed to the British cholera commission and sent to India. This commission was set up to investigate the claims of Robert Koch, who had identified the cause of cholera. Klein and Gibbes found fault in Koch's determination of the causal agent.Gibbes moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1888 to succeed Alonzo B. Palmer as professor of pathology at the University of Michigan. During his tenure at Michigan, he often held out-dated theories of disease causation despite considerable advances in bacteriology. He claimed that phthisis and tuberculosis were separate diseases and that the tubercle bacillus was not proven as the cause of either. In 1895 he moved to Detroit in 1898 to become the city's Health Officer and Professor of Internal Medicine and Pathology at the Michigan College of Medicine and Surgery.He wrote two books, Practical Histology (1880) and Practical pathology and morbid anatomy (1891).He died in McAlester, Oklahoma on July 18, 1912.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Douglas Cunningham", "response": ["Cunningham made pioneering studies in aerobiology. He made use of the aeroconiscope, Richard Leach Maddox (1816\u20131902) invented the aeroconiscope in 1870. a device with a vane that pointed a sampling cone towards the wind with a sticky slide placed behind a funnel. The sticky slide would then be examined for aerially dispersed biota. His studies on the microbes, spores and pollen in the air of Calcutta were published in 1873. Cunningham's other major and official work was in studying the nature of spread of cholera. Their official work however did not progress and the project was terminated and in 1879, Cunningham took up an academic position as Professor of Physiology at the Calcutta Medical College. He was also able to pursue his interests in botany being temporarily appointed in 1880 as a superintendent of the Calcutta Royal Botanic Garden as George King, the regular superintendent, was put in charge of the cinchona plantation in the Mungpoo Hills, Darjeeling District. In 1883, Robert Koch visited India as part of a German cholera research committee and was able to isolate the comma bacteria Vibrio cholerae from the autopsy of a cholera victim. This led to the British government being forced to investigate the matter. A committee made up of two leading pathologists, Heneage Gibbes and Emanuel Klein, was set up and they visited Calcutta in November 1884. Cunningham worked with Klein, helping obtain samples from the same water storage which Koch had declared as being the source of the contagion affecting victims. Klein was able to examine and confirm that the bacteria in the water were similar to those in the bacteria in the stools of cholera victims but he was not sure about whether it caused cholera. The results of Koch however were enough for European governments to declare a quarantine on ship-borne visitors from India. The ensuing debate on the financial losses that would be caused led to the British government's decision to increase spending on research facilities and in December 1884, the Sanitary Commissioner was granted 15,000 rupees to set up a laboratory with Cunningham being made the director. In 1887-88 Cunningham accompanied the Sikkim Expedition as Government naturalist. Cunningham was a member of the council of the Calcutta zoological garden and in 1898, a bronze medallion of him was gifted to the zoological garden. In 1876 he was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society and in June 1889 Fellow of the Royal Society. In June 1893 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire."]}, {"page": "Gibbes", "response": ["*Heneage Gibbes (1837-1912), British pathologist"]}, {"page": "Emanuel Edward Klein", "response": ["Klein's training in Europe however allowed him to access the microbiological techniques developed by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, and he wrote the first major English work in bacteriology in 1884. In 1884, Klein, Alfred Lingard, and Heneage Gibbes were sent as part of the British cholera commission to Calcutta in India to verify the findings of Koch which had caused some embarrassment to the British Indian medical community. Klein was able to find the comma-shaped Vibrio cholerae bacteria in the water supply where Koch had found them as well as in the stools of infected patients. He however did not fully accept the idea that the same bacteria caused the disease. In 1885, he studied the outbreak of a disease of cows which was termed as scarlet fever and isolated four species of bacteria during the research, including Streptococcus pyogenes, the causal agent. Klein also worked on bacteria in food and helped in establishing methods for food processing and preservation. Of the 264 scientific publications in his career nearly 200 were in microbiology. Ronald Ross was one of Klein's students. Klein was the author of the Elements of Histology (1883)."]}, {"page": "Timothy Richards Lewis", "response": ["Lewis was born at Llanboidy, Carmarthenshire to William Lewis and Britania n\u00e9e Richards and he grew up on the family farm at Pembrokeshire. After studying at Narberth National School the grammar school run by Joseph and William Edward Morris he apprenticed to a Narberth chemist. He moved to London when he was nineteen and worked as a chemist in Streatham and later at the German Hospital where he picked up the German language. He also attended lectures at the University College London, received a Fellowes silver medal in 1866 and qualified from Aberdeen University in 1867. In 1868 he joined the army service at Netley and rose to the position of a surgeon-major. He worked for three months at Munich with Max von Pettenkofer and then was posted to Calcutta in 1869. In Calcutta he worked with David Douglas Cunningham. Pettenkofer had suggested that soil conditions helped in cholera outbreaks while Ernst Hallier of Jena had suggested that it was caused by a fungus. Lewis tried to examine these hypotheses making studies of meteorological conditions and examining the stools of infected patients. A study with Cunningham was made on fungal skin infections. While making studies of chyluria, he noticed worms in the urine of a patient which was later found to be filaria and were independently discovered and described by Joseph Bancroft. Lewis examined microscopic organisms in the blood of birds and mammals, and named several species of microbes including a trypanosome, Trypanosoma lewisi, from a rat. He married Emily Frances n\u00e9e Brown on 8 October 1879.  In 1883 he returned to England and worked as a Professor of Pathology at Netley. In 1885 he served as honorary secretary of a committee to study Koch's discovery of cholera. Lewis and his committee members (Heneage Gibbes and Emanuel Klein) submitted an official refutation of Koch's study which may have involved not just science but the position of government officials (such as Sir Joseph Fayrer and J.M. Cuningham) , several of whom opposed the contagion theory which would lead the implementation of quarantine regulations that would come greatly in the way of trade and movement. He died on 7 May 1886 of pneumonia, suspected to have been contracted in a laboratory accident."]}]}}
