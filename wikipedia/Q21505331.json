She was an accomplished collector and her herbarium is now held at Bristol Museum. She was also a member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science as well as the Royal Horticultural Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Bryological Society", "response": ["Many of the first members had expert knowledge and interest in bryology but relied on employment from other areas to make a living. They included H. N. Dixon, S. M. Macvicar, W. E. Nicholson and Eleonora Armitage as well as Waddell. Few were professional academics. However, members included beginners wanting to learn about bryology, and a section to help them was formed in 1900. The total membership was 37 in 1899 and had reached 100 in 1934. Post-war, there were many academic members and also more from outside the UK, in part due to the development of bryology as a subject for study at university.  Membership had increased to 250 in 1950 and was above 500 in the twentyfirst century.", "In 1923 the new name British Bryological Society was adopted along with introduction of an annual meeting and field meetings. H.N. Dixon as President and D. A. Jones and Eleonora Armitage as Secretaries. In 1934 members joined from outside the British Isles including Pierre Allorge, Edwin B. Bartram, Alexander W. Evans, Leopold Loeske and N. Malta. In September 1945 the Society celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Moss Club with a field visit and dinner. "]}]}}
