Craig did not stand for re-election in 1918, when the seat was won a Coalition Liberal, and his next candidacy was at the 1924 general election, when he won the seat in a straight contest with the sitting Labour Party MP Edward Hemmerde. He stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1929 general election.In the King's Birthday Honours 1927, he was made a baronet on 1 July 1927, of Alsager in Cheshire.Ernest Craig, before becoming a politician, along with many other Englishmen went west to the US and to New Mexico in particular. He owned the Last Chance Mine in Mogollon, Grant County, New Mexico, and a picture survives of him in 1908 seated in a motor vehicle at Hudson Springs (now Faywood Hot Springs). He introduced innovative methods of extracting gold. He also established a horse and buggy transport for mining company property movement between Mogollon and Silver City. His only child, Ernestine, later acquired the Mimbres Hot Springs, a few miles from Faywood. Her son Craig Wheaton-Smith managed the Mimbres Hot Springs ranch, and her grandson Simon Wheaton-Smith (Ernest Craig's great grandson) also resides in Silver City, New Mexico.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ernest Craig"]}, {"page": "Alexander Lyle-Samuel", "response": ["Lyle-Samuel seems to have been in uncertain health.
