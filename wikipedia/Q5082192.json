They took up their new appointments on 7 July 1829 and were to become firm friends, working closely together until Rowan's retirement 21 years later. Later that month, they moved into their offices in 4 Whitehall Place and set about the monumental task of creating the new police force from nothing.

His position was junior to Richard Mayne, who had been appointed along with Rowan in 1829. Mayne and Hay did not get along, and Hay was soon complaining to the Home Office about his colleague. He was particularly angered that Mayne took personal charge of the policing of the Great Exhibition in 1851, a job which Hay, as a military man, thought should have gone to him. Hay was, however, appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1851 for his involvement in the Exhibition, although Mayne was appointed to the higher grade of Knight Commander for his involvement at the same time."]}, {"page": "John Wray (civil servant)", "response": ["As Receiver, he had equal authority with the two Joint Commissioners, Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, and worked in harmony with them in establishing the new police force.

The commission was appointed against a background of unrest and violence in some areas of the country, with protests against the New Poor Law and agitation by Chartists for social and political reform. Chadwick was strongly in favour of the creation of a single centralised force, but this was opposed by not only the two other commissioners but also by the Home Secretary, Lord John Russell. Russell wrote to the magistrates of the various counties asking them to support the resolution passed in Shropshire to establish a body of constables paid for out of the county rate and under the control of the magistrates. The commission's report, issued in 1839, followed the lines favoured by Russell. It recommended that \"a properly trained and equipped preventative police force\" based on the pattern of the existing Metropolitan Police, should be established in all counties where the magistrates were in favour. Each force should be funded mostly by local rates, with 25% of the cost met by central government.

Scotland Yard soon became established as a name for the force itself. Once formed, the force became the third official non-paramilitary city police force in the world, after the City of Glasgow Police and the Paris Police. Due to public fears concerning the deployment of the military in domestic matters, Robert Peel organised the force along civilian lines, rather than paramilitary. To appear neutral, the uniform was deliberately manufactured in blue, rather than red which was then a military colour, along with the officers being armed only with a wooden truncheon and a rattle to signal the need for assistance. Until 1864, police officers also wore top hats, to complete the civilian look. Along with this, police ranks did not include military titles, with the exception of Sergeant.Taylor, J. \"The Victorian Police Rattle Mystery\"/  The Constabulary (2003) The original standard wage for a Constable was one guinea (\u00a31.05) a week.
