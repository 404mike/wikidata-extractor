Vale exited the FA Cup at the Third Round following a humiliating 3\u20130 defeat to non-league side Enfield. They initially struggled away from home, but built their league campaign on results at Vale Park. During the season, he handed Mark Chamberlain (brother of top-scorer Neville) his debut, and brought talented winger Johnny Miller to Burslem. He sold goalkeeper Trevor Dance to non-league Stafford Rangers for \u00a310,000, as Harrison was in good form.

However, poor league form continued; on 27 December Vale lost 5\u20131 to Northampton Town at the County Ground, and Phil Sproson was sent off for swearing at teammate Russell Bromage. More away defeats came, with the Vale defence insistent on playing dangerous balls on the outside of their penalty area. On 24 January, they lost 5\u20130 at Field Mill to Mansfield Town, this left them at the foot of the league, four points adrift of safety. McGrath brought in two new signings: big defender Andy Higgins from Chesterfield and midfielder Terry Armstrong; Higgins was restricted mainly to away matches as there the team needed the added strength and height that he provided. He also signed keeper Brian Lloyd on loan from Chester City, and the former Wales international proved to be a revelation. McGrath then installed a five-man defence away from home, the tactic proved a success, as Vale avoided defeat in all but two of their final eight away games. McGrath later reflected that \"that Mansfield match was a dreadful experience, I simply could not wait any longer before taking some action; we had to get some better players.\" Vale went on a streak of seven games unbeaten, recording a 4\u20130 win over fellow strugglers Hereford United. On 26 April, the club started a club-record run of six consecutive draws, which would end on 12 September the next season. Their goalless draw with Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road assured them of safety from re-election.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Andy Higgins", "| February 1981 || DF ||  || Andy Higgins || Chesterfield || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On the financial side, a loss of \u00a365,000 was announced, despite donations of \u00a3136,070.
