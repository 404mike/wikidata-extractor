He made large collections of molluscs and described numerous species from the U.K., India and South Africa.He joined Haileybury College in 1819 and joined the East India Company at Bengal. He reached Calcutta on 30 October 1821 and worked in a number of positions including a District Collector and Officiating Judge in Meerut, Bareilly and other parts of northern India. During his stay in India he collected specimens of numerous land snails some of which he sent to Hugh Cuming in England. \nOn the return from a trip to Mauritius he brought a couple of living Achatina fulica which he gave to a friend in Calcutta in April 1847 who subsequently released them in a garden at Chowringhee. The species is today a pest in many parts of India.His son-in-law Major Richard Sankey was executor of his estate and the collections that he bequeathed went to Sylvanus Hanley, who removed the locality labels of all the specimens thus decreasing their value.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of malacologists", "response": ["*William Henry Benson (1803\u20131870), malacologist \"Great Britain/India/South Africa\""]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Benson \u2013 William Henry Benson (1803\u20131870) malacology"]}, {"page": "Camptoceras", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Henry Benson"]}, {"page": "Diplommatina", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Henry Benson"]}, {"page": "Pupisoma orcula", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Henry Benson"]}, {"page": "Tricula montana", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Henry Benson"]}, {"page": "Macrochlamys indica", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Henry Benson"]}, {"page": "Ariophanta interrupta", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Henry Benson"]}, {"page": "Indrella", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Henry Benson"]}, {"page": "Erepta setiliris", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Henry Benson"]}, {"page": "William Benson", "response": ["* William Henry Benson (1803\u20131870), British amateur malacologist"]}, {"page": "Richard Hieram Sankey", "response": ["Sankey married Sophia Mary, daughter of William Henry Benson of the Indian Civil Service, at Ootacamund in 1858.

In his spare time, he also took an interest in natural history, making collections of molluscs, birds and plants. He also made studies of some molluscs in life. He wrote notes in the Gazetteer on natural history and his publications on the topic included a \"Key to the Natural Orders of Plants in the Bombay Presidency\", \"Popular list of birds of the Bombay Presidency with Notes\", \"A list of the Birds of the Palani Hills, with Notes\", \"List of the Reptiles of the Bombay Presidency, with Notes\" and \"list of the Deccan fishes, with notes\". He collaborated with other naturalists including William Thomas Blanford who named a genus of a mollusc Fairbankia after him although it is now a synonym of Iravadia. Achatina fairbanki was named after him by William Henry Benson. Blanford also named Trochalopteron fairbanki after a specimen collected by Fairbank from Kodaikanal. He also corresponded on birds with Allan Octavian Hume.  A set of fern specimens collected by Fairbank reside in the Pringle Herbarium (VT), at the University of Vermont.
