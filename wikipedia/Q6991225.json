While there, he unintentionally caused Gail Porter to leave the station in tears after only one show; he criticised her performance, which Pilkington defended as an attempt to encourage improvement. After several years, he began work on The Ricky Gervais Show. Initially, Pilkington was solely the programme's producer and rarely spoke on-air, but as Gervais and Merchant began to frequently invite him to make cameo appearances, Pilkington's quirky persona came to light and his popularity increased. He was eventually included as a main presenter on the broadcasts, with large amounts of airtime devoted to his unusual thoughts on various subjects, often due to his misunderstanding of science and nature, and childhood stories. He created many features for the broadcasts, including Monkey News, Rockbusters, Educating Ricky and many others.

An American version hosted by Jeff Sutphen premiered on ABC on 21 June 2011.", "In each of the first four rounds, Nemone reveals the exit method that will be used to dismiss the losing contestant, numbered between 1 and 101. Jones then asks a question and reads as many answers as there are contestants still in the game; all but one of them are correct. After each contestant secretly chooses one answer, all reveal their selections. If any answer is chosen by multiple contestants, a tiebreaker question on the buzzer is used to determine which one of them gets to keep it. After all ties have been resolved, the remaining contestants select again from the unchosen answers. Further toss-ups are played as needed until all contestants have chosen different answers, at which point they are prepared for the exit. Jones reveals one correct answer at a time until only two contestants are left in jeopardy, then announces the wrong answer. The contestant who chose it is immediately eliminated from the game. Once per episode, a buzzer sounds off between rounds to indicate that an \"Emergency Exit\" round must be played. Jones asks a question to one contestant at a time in random order and the first to miss a question is eliminated. Once three contestants remain, the fifth and final round begins, following the same format as the previous four except that the question has only one right answer.
