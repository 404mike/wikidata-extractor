Berry was a good header of the ball and while he lacked technical skill he made up for it with his determination and commitment which combined with his distinctive afro style haircut (copied from the Jackson 5) meant Berry was well on his way to becoming a cult hero. With Stoke bottom of the First Division in December 1983 Barker was sacked and caretaker manager Bill Asprey banished Berry to the youth team as he sought to restore defensive stability to the team which had conceded 33 goals in the first 17 matches.
