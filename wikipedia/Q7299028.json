After graduating, he was asked to set up a photography department at Watford College. Moore became interested in photography at a time when photography was still viewed in Britain as an undistinguished craft rather than a serious art form. Influenced by some of the images in Hugo van Wadenoyen's seminal 1947 Wayside Snapshots book - a book which marked the start of the decisive British break with Pictorialism - Moore began to see fresh possibilities in the composition & framing of everyday English landscapes. Moore went on to create black & white fine art photographs; having his first solo gallery show in 1959. He continued teaching for most of his life, and he is widely regarded as one of the great teachers. Visiting the U.S. in 1968, he worked with photographer Minor White at MIT and was influenced by Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind. He had his first major solo show in 1970 at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1974 he became a lecturer at the influential Trent Polytechnic, Nottingham, but left in 1978 to pursue his own creative work in Cumbria. From around 1976 the climate in England slowly began to change in favour of art photography; and so Moore finally saw acclaim in his own country with a major London retrospective show at the Hayward Gallery, the publication of a strong book collection of his photography, and a BBC television documentary about his work. Moore's influential work has now been out-of-print for more than twenty years.", "link_mentions": {}}}
