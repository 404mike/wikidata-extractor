The roots of progressive house can be traced back to the early 1990s rave and club scenes in the United Kingdom. In 1992, Mixmag described it at the time as a \"new breed of hard but tuneful, banging but thoughtful, uplifting and trancey British house.\" A combination of American, British, Italian, Polish, and German house and techno largely influenced one another during this era. The term was used mainly as a marketing label to differentiate new rave house from traditional American house. Progressive house was a departure from the Chicago acid house sound. The buzz word emerged from the rave scene around 1990 to 1992, describing a new sound of house that broke away from its American roots. Progressive house was viewed by some as anti-rave as its popularity rose in English clubs while breakbeat hardcore flourished at raves. According to DJ Dave Seaman, the sound faced a backlash in the early 1990s because \"it had gone the same way as progressive rock before it. Pompous, po-faced and full of its own self importance. But basically was really quite boring.\" The label progressive house was often used interchangeably with trance in the early years. AllMusic says that progressive house \"led the increasingly mainstream-sounding house from the charts back to the dance floors\".", "According to Dave Seaman, house DJs who had originally played what was known as Eurodance borrowed from that the genre. This led to a commercial sound that people associate with progressive house today. Seaman notes that with the various lines between genres having become so blurred that true progressive house is often found \"masquerading\" as techno, tech house or even deep house. As such, the music can feature elements derived from styles such as dub, deep house and Italo house."]}, {"page": "Impossible Princess", "response": ["Brothers in Rhythm put together a few songs initially planned for Impossible Princess but scrapped them because Minogue had started writing and they saw she had development as an artist. In order to work closely with Brothers in Rhythm, Minogue shared a house with them across the road from the Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, where each morning she would present a set of lyrics from the night before to Brothers in Rhythm producer Dave Seaman. Minogue then sang her ideas for the melody to the duo who tried to compose the backing tracks, find a suitable style, record rough demos, and add subtle lyric and melody ideas to each of them. Production took place mainly at Real World, where the rough demos were rearranged. Strings were added at Sarm West Studios in London, and the tracks were then sent back to Real World for the final mixes, handled by engineer Alan Bremner.; ", "Lyrically, most of the album deals with the theme of romantic relationships, self-discovery and freedom of expression.;  Dave Seaman noted that Minogue's input was more significant on this album and that most of the album's subjects were \"her own ideas\" and that she wanted to grow as a person from this experience. Most of the album is autobiographical, based upon Minogue's life during the two years preceding the album.;  Sean Smith believed the songs reveal Minogue's life more than any interview, and they were \"complex, serious, introspective and challenging\" in contrast with her \"crooning love songs\" on the previous albums.
