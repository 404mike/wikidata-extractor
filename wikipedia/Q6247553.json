After a season long struggle against relegation, Palace were eventually able to secure safety, finishing in twentieth place above demoted Sheffield Wednesday and Sunderland. The club managed to gain three new records for the First Division at the end of this season: the fewest goals scored; the fewest wins recorded by a non-relegated team; and the tally of twenty-seven points was the smallest number with which a team has avoided relegation from the top flight.Matthews, 113\u2013115 Palace avoided the drop for two more seasons,Matthews, 115\u2013121 and followed the trend of many other top flight clubs by introducing a new \"Player of the Year\" award which has been presented at the end of every season since the 1971\u201372 campaign.
