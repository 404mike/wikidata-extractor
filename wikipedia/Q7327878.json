Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine Miroir du Cyclisme: \"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it. That's a promise.\" On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: \"Next year, it's you\", repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of  that same evening. Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper L'\u00c9quipe ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child's scooter, with Hinault saying \"Because you've been so good, I'll take you along next year on my handlebars\", to which LeMond replied: \"Thanks, Uncle Bernard.\" LeMond's first Tour victory the following year did not come as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the 1986 Tour de France, only conceding defeat after the last time trial. LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\" The rivalry between Hinault and LeMond in both the 1985 and 1986 Tours was subject of the documentary Slaying the Badger, part of ESPN's series 30 for 30.
