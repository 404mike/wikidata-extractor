He was a right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper. In his nine-year-long first-class career he played for both his home team of Essex, and Marylebone. Having represented the Essex Second XI for many years in the Second XI championship from the age of sixteen, he moved to the first-class team in 1993.\nHaving faced nearly three years without a first-class match, and not playing a single game throughout 1994, he returned to the Second XI side in 1995, but most impressed during 2000, when his industrious lower-middle order batting and top-quality performances behind the stumps aided Essex to promotion from Division Two of the County Championship.\nHyam has not played league cricket since his Second XI appearances for Essex in 2003.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Higham (surname)", "response": ["*Barry Hyam (born 1975), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1978\u2013)", "response": ["* Barry Hyam (1999/2000) : B.
