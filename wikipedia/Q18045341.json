He emigrated to the Netherlands in 1957, then moved to Switzerland (Leysin 1966, Villars 1973 and Geneva 1975-77). He was Head of Art at Aiglon College (1967\u201373) and from 1976\u20131990 was Chief Examiner for the Visual Arts programme of the International Baccalaureate, designing and developing the Visual Art curriculum and traveling worldwide to give workshops on the role of the arts in education and the relationships of the visual arts and music. He returned to Holland in 1978 and now lives in Amsterdam.Perryman has exhibited widely (in The Netherlands, U.K., Switzerland, Germany and the U.S.). His principal themes are portraits, landscapes, dance and in particular, music. He uses the fluid transparency of watercolour to convey the illusion of movement and the transient nature of music and dance. His work is both figurative and abstract expressionist. Perryman\u2019s earliest paintings on musical themes stem from the early sixties. One of his first subjects was conductor Bernard Haitink in 1965, conducting the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam.  This led to many 'action portraits' of other great musicians, such as the  violinist Lord Yehudi Menuhin.In 1990, Perryman was commissioned to paint a series of large watercolours of musical celebrities for Symphony Hall,  Birmingham (UK). These include conductors Riccardo Chailly, Valery Gergiev, Andris Nelsons, Carlo Maria Giulini, Bernard Haitink, Kurt Masur and Sir Simon Rattle, violinists Sarah Chang, Kyung Wha Chung, Yehudi Menuhin and Itzhak Perlman, pianists Vladimir Ashkenazy and Alfred Brendel, singers Bryn Terfel, Jos\u00e9 Carreras, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Jessye Norman, Luciano Pavarotti, cellists Yo-Yo Ma and Mstislav Rostropovich. This collection is arguably one of the world's largest collections of musical subjects by the same artist. Included in this collection are the large works The Mahler Experience and Elgar\u2019s Dream.", "link_mentions": []}}
