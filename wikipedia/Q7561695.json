She is a Professor of Black Art and Design at University of the Arts London. Boyce's research interests explore art as a social practice and the critical and contextual debates that arise from this area of study. With an emphasis on collaborative work, Boyce has been working closely with other artists since 1990, often involving improvisation and spontaneous performative actions on the part of her collaborators. Boyce's work involves a variety of media, such as drawing, print, photography, video, and sound. Her art explores \"the relationship between sound and memory, the dynamics of space, and incorporating the spectator\". To date, Boyce has taught Fine Art studio practice for more than thirty years in several art colleges across the UK.In February 2020 Boyce was selected by the British Council to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale 2022.
