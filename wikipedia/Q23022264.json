Siepmann was instrumental in drafting the FCC document \"Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees\", which became known as the \"Blue Book\" for its distinctive colour.  Though he was an academic, Siepmann remained an advocate for the democratic potentials of radio and television and was \"overtly political and engaged with media policy interventions\" during his career. His advocacy was met with a \"storm of protest in the [broadcast] industry\" and he was frequently red-baited for his views.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
