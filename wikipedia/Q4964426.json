He captained the county from 1969 until 1971 and his career tally of 1390 wickets ranks him third in the county's history, behind only Jack White and Arthur Wellard.Langford made his debut for Somerset in 1953 at the Recreation Ground, Bath with an unremarkable appearance against Lancashire, taking just one wicket in an innings and 24 run loss. In the next match against Kent, starting the following day on the same ground, he took 8/96 in the first innings, bowling a 41 over spell to see the innings through. He helped secure victory for Somerset with another 6 wickets in the second innings. At only 17 years and 5 months, this ten-wicket haul made him the youngest player to do so in the County Championship, a record that stood until May 2007, when James Harris completed the feat a few days after his 17th birthday. A third game without break on the ground against Leicestershire brought further success for Langford, although his 6/53 in the first innings and 5/81 in the second weren't enough to prevent Somerset from slipping to a 144 run loss. Unfortunately for Somerset and Langford, the 26 wickets he took his opening three matches for the county accounted for just over half of his season's total, as he took just 25 more in the remaining 15 matches in 1953.In a game against Lancashire in 1958, Langford finished the match with 15 wickets for 54 runs. This is the second best match figures for Somerset and his first innings' 9/26 is the third best performance in an innings. He finished the year with 116 wickets, a career best.\nIn 1969, he had the following remarkable analysis in the John Player League (40 over List A match) against Essex at Yeovil: 8 overs, 8 maidens, 0 runs, 0 wickets. He remains the only person to have bowled a full complement of overs in a List A match without conceding a single run.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 17", "response": ["*1935 \u2013 Brian Langford, English cricketer (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "Colin McCool", "response": ["In 138 matches across the five seasons for Somerset, McCool made 7,913 runs at an average of 33.82. He also took 219 wickets at 28.05 but in his five years with the county he was never the first-choice spin bowler: in his first two seasons, Somerset used Australian-born slow left-arm orthodox bowler John McMahon as the main spin bowler, with young off-spin bowler Brian Langford also bowling more than McCool. When McMahon left, Langford took over as the top spin bowler, and by 1960 was bowling four times the number of overs that McCool took. But McCool had also lost some of his control at this stage: \"He could do beguiling things with the ball, though length and line seemed to become a decreasing consideration,\" says the history of Somerset cricket. He also made 146 catches, many of them at first slip, where he stood \"rather deeper than usual\". His influence on Somerset's recovery from the trough of the early 1950s was considerable. A later Somerset history says: \"Occasionally some of the younger pros didn't relish the way he treated them. Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own. But their respect for his competitive approach and sheer experience was undeniable.\""]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Brian Langford (1953\u20131974) 504 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Jim Hilton", "response": ["In 1956, fellow off-spinner Brian Langford returned from National Service and became first-choice, and though Hilton played fairly regularly again in 1957, he left the county's staff at the end of the season.

And John McMahon, who took five first innings wickets for Surrey in the game that Stenton appeared in, was signed by Somerset as a slow left-arm bowler for 1954. Stenton did not play first-class cricket again after this one appearance."]}, {"page": "Ernie Robson", "response": ["He played his final match for Somerset in July 1923, aged 53, opening the bowling in the first-innings and despite his years, he bowled 18 overs.  Rheumatism and the onset of a serious illness made him decide to retire from playing cricket, and he joined the first-class umpires list.  He officiated in his maiden first-class match later in the 1923 season, between Somerset and the touring West Indians.  His health deteriorated, and this was the only match he umpired.  He died in May 1924.  At the time of his last match for Somerset, he had made more appearances for Somerset than any other cricketer, his 424 appearances comfortably placing him ahead of Sammy Woods' 299.  He was later passed by Harold Stephenson (427) and Brian Langford (504).  His 1122 wickets for Somerset were also a club-record, ahead of Ted Tyler's 864, and Jack White, who had 889 wickets at the close of the 1923 season, but went on to surpass Robson's tally, finishing his career with 2165 wickets for Somerset."]}, {"page": "Haydn Sully", "response": ["A left-handed tail-end batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler, Sully played for Somerset occasionally from 1959 to 1963, but was unable to win a regular place with the presence of Brian Langford, also an off-spinner, in the team. He joined Northamptonshire in 1964, and the following season, coming into the side regularly from mid-July, took 42 wickets at an average of 18 each, including 27 in just three matches. Northamptonshire finished second in the County Championship, four points behind the eventual winners, Worcestershire, the closest the team has ever come to winning the title."]}, {"page": "Paddle scoop", "response": ["The \"Paddle scoop\" shot was played much earlier, by then Somerset captain, Brian Langford, in an English county match at the Edgarley ground in Glastonbury in 1962.  It probably escaped the headlines because Langford, as primarily a spin bowler, batted well down the order - usually at 9."]}, {"page": "Bertie Buse", "response": ["Somerset batted first and were all out in around 90 minutes for just 55. Off-spin bowler Roy Tattersall unusually opened the bowling, and took seven for 25. No Somerset batsman reached double figures, and Buse made just five. When Lancashire batted, Buse himself proved almost as deadly, taking four of the first five wickets that fell for just 46 runs. But then Peter Marner and Alan Wharton decided to hit out, and put on a stand of 70 in 25 minutes for the sixth wicket. In all, Lancashire totalled 158, made off just 32 overs, with Buse taking six for 41 and the innings finishing by teatime on the first day. Somerset's second innings then proved no better than the first, with Brian Statham joining Tattersall in the wickets. Only a last-wicket partnership of 35 by Jim Redman and the debutant Brian Langford delayed matters at all. Somerset were all out for 79, losing by an innings and 24 runs, with Tattersall having match figures of 13 wickets for 69 runs. The game was over by six o'clock on the evening of the first day."]}, {"page": "Malcolm Walker (cricketer)", "response": ["Born at Mexborough, Yorkshire, Walker was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-spin bowler. He played five matches as a 16-year-old for Yorkshire's second eleven in 1950, and one the following year, but then joined Somerset where he made his first-class debut in the match against the 1952 Indian side. Three wickets in the match earned him a contract, and in 1953 he started the season as a regular member of what was a very weak side. But in nine matches he scored just 74 runs and took only nine wickets, and was upstaged that summer by an even younger off-spin bowler, Brian Langford, who took 51 County Championship wickets, including 26 in his first three matches."]}, {"page": "Roy Kerslake", "response": ["The following season, he played regularly for Cambridge and won his blue. He headed the Cambridge bowling averages with 26 wickets at a cost of only 13.30 each and made 259 runs in the lower order, without reaching 50. In the second half of the season, he played again for Somerset, making only a few runs and failing to take a single wicket as the county relied for off-spin on the established Brian Langford."]}, {"page": "Alan Whitehead (cricketer)", "response": ["He made his debut as a 16-year-old in two end-of-season friendly first-class matches against Sussex in August 1957; in the second of these matches, he played alongside John McMahon, Somerset's incumbent left-arm spinner, who was then sacked by the county at the end of the season. In 1958, he played in only three matches and failed to take a wicket, Eric Bryant being preferred as the left-arm spin option to bowl alongside off-spinner Brian Langford."]}, {"page": "John McMahon (Surrey and Somerset cricketer)", "response": ["Somerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly."]}, {"page": "David Doughty", "response": ["Doughty's single List A appearance produced a curiosity. Playing in Somerset's first-ever one-day match in the inaugural Gillette Cup against Glamorgan in 1963, he took one wicket and then came in to bat at No 10 with Somerset at 121 for eight, chasing a total of 207. Doughty scored 20 and put on 75 for the ninth wicket with Brian Langford, who made 56. In 2009, the stand was still Somerset's ninth-wicket List A cricket record and the oldest surviving List A record."]}, {"page": "Jim Redman (cricketer)", "response": ["Redman played only three more times for Somerset as an amateur, all of them matches at the Bath cricket festival in 1953, and he bowled only 18 overs in these matches, taking just two further wickets. He did have a prominent role in one of the season's memorable matches, though: the game against Lancashire, designated as Bertie Buse's benefit match, was finished inside a single day on a terrible pitch. Somerset's two innings resulted in totals of 55 and 79, and the match lasted up till six o-clock on the first day only because of a second-innings last-wicket stand of 35 between Redman, who made an unbeaten 27 \u2013 the only other double-figure score in the match for Somerset was 14 by Harold Stephenson \u2013 and the 17-year-old Brian Langford.

Between 1953 and 1974 the right-arm off break bowler played 504 times for the club. Only three other players have made more than 400 appearances for Somerset, and no-one has reached the milestone since Langford. Jack White, one of the three, is the club's leading wicket-taker in first-class cricket, claiming 2,165 dismissals for the county between 1909 and 1937. Harold Gimblett's tally of 21,142 first-class runs is the most by a Somerset cricketer, over 1,000 more than the next, Marcus Trescothick."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Brian Langford", "|align=left|Brian Langford", "|align=left|Brian Langford", "|align=left|Brian Langford", "|align=left|Brian Langford", "|align=left|Brian Langford"]}, {"page": "Mike Latham", "response": ["A right-handed lower-order batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler, Latham played for Gloucestershire's second eleven in 1959 and 1960 before switching to Somerset for the 1961 season.
