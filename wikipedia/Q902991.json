Born in Kent, he was working as a labourer in Woolwich in the late 1810s and early 1820s, before joining the Royal Artillery. He was married to Mary, and had four children, two of whom died in infancy. His surviving daughters were Lavinia Bithiah (1821-1896) and Lucretia Victoria (1829-1910).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Forensic science", "response": ["James Marsh was the first to apply this new science to the art of forensics.

Until the early 19th century, there were no methods to accurately determine if a particular chemical was present, and poisoners were rarely punished for their crimes.  In 1836, one of the first major contributions to forensic chemistry was introduced by British chemist James Marsh.  He created the Marsh test for arsenic detection, which was subsequently used successfully in a murder trial.  It was also during this time that forensic toxicology began to be recognized as a distinct field.  Mathieu Orfila, the \"father of toxicology\", made great advancements to the field during the early 19th century.  A pioneer in the development of forensic microscopy, Orfila contributed to the advancement of this method for the detection of blood and semen.  Orfila was also the first chemist to successfully classify different chemicals into categories such as corrosives, narcotics, and astringents."]}, {"page": "Marie Lafarge", "response": ["The test that Moran was referring to was actually invented in 1836 by a Scottish chemist named James Marsh, who worked at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. Called upon to help solve a murder nearby, he tried to detect arsenic using the old methods. While he was successful, the sample had decomposed and did not convince the jury of the defendant's guilt. Frustrated at this turn of events, Marsh developed a glass apparatus not only to detect minute traces of arsenic, but also to measure its quantity. The sample is mixed with arsenic-free zinc and sulphuric acid, any arsenic present causing the production of arsine gas and hydrogen. The gas is then led through a tube where it is heated strongly, decomposing into hydrogen and arsenic vapor. When the arsenic vapor impinges on a cold surface, a mirror-like deposit of arsenic forms."]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* 1836: Marsh test (used for detecting arsenic poisoning) invented by James Marsh (1794\u20131846)."]}, {"page": "James Marsh", "response": ["James Marsh may refer to:", "* James Marsh (artist) (born 1946), English artist", "* James Marsh (chemist) (1794\u20131846), British chemist", "* James Marsh (cricketer) (1870\u20131930), English cricketer and clergyman", "* James Marsh (director) (born 1963), British film director", "* James Marsh (British Army officer) (died 1804), British general", "* James Marsh (philosopher) (1794\u20131842), American Christian transcendentalist philosopher and president of the University of Vermont", "* James Marsh (priest) (1848\u2013?), English Anglican priest", "* James Marsh (basketball) (born 1970), American-German player for the Germany national basketball team", "*James Marsh (comedian), known as Jimmy Jewel"]}, {"page": "Petrus Jacobus Kipp", "response": ["In 1842, Kipp published the results of research into the presence of arsenic in livers and kidneys in rabbits.
