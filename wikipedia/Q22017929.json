She replied \"This is a curiosity, I would rather not rob you. Will you let me buy it?\". Offended, he answered \"In that case, I will put it in the fire.\" She pulled it out, before it was damaged.

He worked as a postman, after losing the fingers of his left hand in an accident at a sawmill when young. This disability stopped him playing the fiddle, but he was able to play the cello, stopping the strings with the edge of his hand. He was also precentor in the local Free Church, as his father, also Charles, had been before him. He was also superintendent of the Sunday School. He composed several dance tunes, including the strathspey \"The Auld Boat of Logierait\", and a reel, \"Miss Murray Threipland of Fingask\". He had a collection of old tune books; this included the William Dixon manuscript, which he gave to Dorothea Ruggles-Brise in 1909. This, dating from 1733, is the oldest collection of bagpipe music from the British Isles, and the most extensive source known of music for the Border pipes."]}, {"page": "Ruggles-Brise", "response": ["*Dorothea Ruggles-Brise (1866\u20131937), Scottish folk song collector"]}]}}
