He played in each of Derby's first three FA Cup Final appearances. He was reputedly one of the heaviest players to have taken to a football pitch.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nottingham Forest F.C.", "response": ["Forest's first FA Cup semi-final win was at the fifth attempt, the 1897\u201398 FA Cup 2\u20130 replay win against Southampton.

In that 1898 FA Cup Final at Crystal Palace before 62,000 fans, Willie Wragg passed a 19th minute free kick to Arthur Capes. Capes shot through the defensive wall to score. Derby equalised with a free kick headed home by Steve Bloomer off the underside of the cross bar after 31 minutes. In the 42nd minute Jack Fryer was unable to hold a Charlie Richards shot giving Capes a tap in for his second goal.

Derby's keeper Jack Fryer played despite an existing injury which he aggravated early in the second half when he was trying to prevent Charlie Sagar from scoring Bury's second goal. As a result, Fryer was forced to leave the field and, as substitutes were not allowed then, one of the full-backs deputised in goal and their team was down to ten men for most of the last forty minutes. Bury scored three goals in four minutes just before the hour was up and their sixth after 76 minutes. Joe Leeming scored the third and last goals. Willie Wood and Jack Plant scored the other two. The final was a no contest and Derby were lambasted by the press for their poor performance. One reporter commented that, but for being merciful, Bury should have scored twenty. Bury's 6\u20130 win established an FA Cup final record for the biggest winning margin. Bury remained sole holders of the record until the 2019 final in which Manchester City defeated Watford by the same score. The ball used in the 1903 final is on display at the National Football Museum."]}, {"page": "1899 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|GK || Jack Fryer"]}, {"page": "1902 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The semi-finals were staged at neutral venues on Saturday, 15 March, and Sheffield United were drawn to play Derby County at The Hawthorns in West Bromwich. The result was a 1\u20131 draw before a crowd of 33,603. The Times report says that Derby were the better team and \"deserved to win\". After Derby took an early lead through Ben Warren, Sheffield's second-half equaliser was scored against the run of play by George Hedley after a mistake by the Derby goalkeeper, Jack Fryer, and The Times says this cost Derby a victory."]}, {"page": "1903 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Derby were hidebound by injuries in this period. Their star forward Steve Bloomer sustained a swollen ankle that kept him out of the final and he was joined on the sidelines by regular halfback Charlie Leckie. Left winger George Davis was temporarily sidelined but was fit for the final. The most significant injury in terms of the final, however, was a groin strain suffered by goalkeeper Jack Fryer when stretching to reach a cross against Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park on Easter Monday, 13 April, just five days before the final.", "The weather was dry but the pitch was described as hard and uneven. The pitch seems to have helped Bury take the lead after twenty minutes when their captain George Ross aimed a lofted shot goalwards and the ball bounced awkwardly to deceive Jack Fryer before looping over his head. If Fryer had been fully fit, he would probably have saved the goal.", "|GK || Jack Fryer"]}, {"page": "History of Nottingham Forest F.C.", "response": ["Forest's first FA Cup semi-final win was at the fifth attempt, the 1897\u201398 FA Cup 2\u20130 replay win against Southampton.
