For example, the fibers first demonstrated by Philip Russell consisted of a hexagonal lattice of air holes in a silica fiber, with a solid (1996) or hollow (1998) core at the center where light is guided.  Other arrangements include concentric rings of two or more materials, first proposed as \"Bragg fibers\" by Yeh and Yariv (1978), a variant of which was recently fabricated by Temelkuran et al. (2002), bow-tie, panda and elliptical holes structures used to achieve higher Birefringence due to irregularity in the relative refractive index, spiral designs for higher degrees of freedom in controlling the optical properties due to the flexibility in changing different parameters and other types.", "The term \"photonic-crystal fiber\" was coined by Philip Russell in 1995\u20131997 (he states (2003) that the idea dates to unpublished work in 1991).", "* Philip Russell: Photonic Crystal Fibers, Historical account in: IEEE LEOS Newsletter, October 2007", "* Philip Russell plenary presentation: Emerging Applications of Photonic Crystal Fibers SPIE Newsroom"]}, {"page": "List of Oriel College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Philip Russell, FRS \u2013 Director of the third division of the Max Planck Research Group at the Institute of Optics, Information and Photonics at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg."]}, {"page": "MPRG Erlangen Division 3", "response": ["Division 3 of the Max Planck Research Group (MPRG) in Erlangen began operations with the arrival of its director Philip Russell in October, 2005.
