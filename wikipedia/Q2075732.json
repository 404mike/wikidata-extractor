P. Hobson, or Peter Hobson, is a Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at University College London known for his work on autism and experimental child psychology. His research leads him to conclusions concerning the origins of consciousness, summarized in a book for the general reader, The Cradle of Thought.\nThe core of his analysis is that human minds are the outcome of a successful series of interactions between infant and caregiver(s). In this Hobson's research has built on foundations established by Colwyn Trevarthen from the mid-1970s onwards. Trevarthen identified distinct steps in pre-lingual infant development, Primary Intersubjectivity and Secondary Intersubjectivity, which endow the infant's developing mind/brain with the architecture necessary for the achievement of symbolic thought.\nHobson throws further light on this basic claim by examining what occurs in cases where, for genetic or environmental reasons, infants are denied the opportunity to investigate intersubjective relationships. To achieve a rare vantage point on human development without unethical experimentation, Hobson examines cases of autism, Down syndrome, congenital blindness and extreme social deprivation (for which statistically significant numbers of orphans rescued from Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu's Romanian orphanages were available). The obstacles each of these circumstances placed in the way of normal infant-caregiver interaction are finely examined.\nHobson's argument constitutes a challenge to certain flavors of sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology, in that it traces the conception of the human mind back to a 'cradle' of social interactions, without which consciousness in the full, human sense is unobtainable. On the other hand, Hobson demonstrates that a hard-wired emotional connection is crucial for an infant to start the process of intersubjective learning. The experience of having an emotion elicited by another human being, and eliciting emotional responses in others, is identified as the material out of which humans fashion their sense of self, other, object and symbol.\nHobson's thesis is of growing interest in Philosophy of Mind and related disciplines. Edward Skidelsky suggests that Hobson fatally overlooks the fact that people with autism learn to speak (see External Links, below). Others have understood Hobson to be blaming parents for autism, a charge explicitly rejected in The Cradle of Thought.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hobson (surname)", "response": ["* Peter Hobson, English psychology professor"]}, {"page": "Interaction theory", "response": ["The basic ideas of IT can be traced back to the work of Colwyn Trevarthen, who coined the term \u2018primary intersubjectivity\u2019 to refer to early developing sensory-motor processes of interaction between infants and caregivers.  Other work in developmental psychology by Daniel Stern, Andrew N. Meltzoff, Peter Hobson, Vasu Reddy, and others, provides important evidence for the role of interaction in social cognition.  Similar insights can be found earlier in the work of the phenomenologists, like Max Scheler and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. IT has also motivated a rethinking in the methods for studying social cognition in neuroscience.Schilbach, L.,Timmermans, B., Reddy, V., Costal, A., Schlicht, T. and Vogeley, K. 2013.

Other topics he writes about besides his loneliness and datelessness are his unusual behavior.

Uta Frith has described him as articulate and literate, and notes his use of highly sophisticated language.", "According to Professor Elizabeth Newson, who wrote the foreword, Miedzianik's writing ability was so strong that only minor edits were required before publication. She also attributed the novel's genesis to a study on autistic people conducted in 1978 by the University, for which Miedzianik's mother was interviewed, and a follow-up in which Miedzianik himself was interviewed.Elizabeth Newson, My Autobiography (foreword), pp. i-iii, December 1986.
