Members refer to the club being akin to John Dowie's College, an affectionate name for a tavern in the Old Town which had been demolished three decades earlier but which had a reputation as a meeting place for the artistic community. This implies they met in a bar, but is unclear which one. The club name implies a degree of alcohol consumption.http://www.avictorian.com/Archer_James.html"]}]}}
