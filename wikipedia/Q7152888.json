Stokes' form at this time was often unimpressive, drawing criticism from supporters, and he was also disciplined by the club after he returned to Celtic late from a trip to his home city of Dublin. Stokes continued to feature on the left wing for Celtic though, and it was from his cross that Kris Commons scored the opening goal on 15 March 2015 in Celtic's 2\u20130 win over Dundee United in the League Cup Final. He commented after the final, \"I do need to show that I can still bring something to the team and I thought I did that today. I felt fresher and sharper.
