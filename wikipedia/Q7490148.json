In May 2010, Green reported that in an upcoming episode, Lucas would be seen to strangle Denise and dispose of her body in a canal. He questioned whether Parish was to be written out of the soap, following the announcements that both Benjamin and Owusu would be leaving EastEnders later in 2010. Discussing the storyline, Gilet refused to reveal whether Lucas would kill Denise, but indicated that events may not be as they seemed. Parish commented: \"It looks really bad as he gets Denise in a headlock and chokes her. If she survives, it'll be a miracle.\" Following the episode where Denise appeared to be strangled by Lucas, entertainment journalist Sharon Marshall appeared on This Morning, saying there would be \"twists and turns\" but would not confirm whether Denise was dead or alive. It ultimately transpired that Lucas had faked Denise's death to hold her hostage in a basement.

Me and her have been very close.\" Coronation Street producer Kate Oates said she would \"break new ground\" with Carla, and doesn\u2019t intend to force the character back into a destructive cycle of misery but will instead reinvigorate her feisty side. Carla Connor's exit storyline had been criticised for making her leave \"powerless and in disgrace.\" Writing in Radio Times at the time of the character's departure, David Brown criticised her leaving storyline as being \"cruel\" and \"undeserved\", saying \"After all, this is a woman who \u2013 during her ten years on screen \u2013 has been held hostage, raped, suffered a miscarriage, contemplated suicide and had two husbands die on her,\" commenting that \"we want our soap femme fatales to exit with their heads held high.\" Oates has said that Carla Connor will clash with her best friend Michelle Connor when she returns, saying \"The Carla that we see is very different to the Carla who left the Street a couple of years ago. I really wanted to bring back that feisty side to the character and while it's right that she and Michelle will have some tension ahead, there\u2019s a different \u2013 and quite unexpected \u2013 story which initially brings her back at the end of the year.\" Oates has stated she would like to keep King in the show for as long as possible.
