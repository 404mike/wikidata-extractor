He lives in Burton Joyce.\nHe enjoyed considerable success as a player, making his Notts County debut in their 1984\u201385 Second Division campaign which ended in relegation. He was a regular first team player from 1985\u201386 onwards, helping them win promotion back to the Second Division in 1990 and to the First Division a year later (both through the playoffs). However, a serious knee injury in February 1992 ruled him out for the next two years and meant that County were without him when they needed him most \u2014 during the final quarter of the 1991\u201392 season when they battled against relegation from the First Division. The relegation battle was lost, and he managed just one appearance in the 1993\u201394 season as he made his comeback from injury.\nHe was fully fit for the 1994\u201395 season, but his presence in the team wasn't enough to prevent a relegation battle which was ultimately lost.\nBy the time County went down from Division One (as the old Second Division became known following the creation of the FA Premier League for the 1992\u201393 season), Yates had transferred to their local rivals Derby County - a \u00a3350,000 fee taking him to the Baseball Ground on 26 January 1995. He had played 314 league games in 10 years for Notts County.\nThe Rams had been favourites for promotion every season since their relegation from the top flight in 1991, but the closest they had come to achieving Premier League status was playoff defeats in 1992 and 1994, and when Yates arrived the playoffs were looking beyond their reach. They could only manage a ninth-place finish in 1994\u201395, but they achieved automatic promotion the following season as Yates's contributed 38 league appearances and two goals. However, the arrival of Igor Stimac restricted Yates to just 10 appearances in 1996\u201397 and nine the following season as Derby established themselves as a consistent mid table Premier League side.He departed to Watford, newly promoted to Division One as Division Two champions, on 16 July 1998 on a free transfer. However, injury problems restricted his first team opportunities at Vicarage Road and he played just 12 games, scoring once against Bristol City, in the 1998\u201399 season. Watford won a second successive promotion via the playoffs and reached the Premier League, but Yates did not feature in the 1999\u20132000 campaign as Watford were relegated. After the end of the season, he retired from playing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Dean Yates", "|1987 ||  Dean Yates"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 in English football", "response": ["13 July 1989 \u2013 Third Division Notts County reject a \u00a3750,000 bid for 22\u2013year\u2013old defender Dean Yates."]}, {"page": "Rob Page", "response": ["Page started his professional career at Watford in 1993, having been with the club from the age of 11. He established himself as a key member of the first team under manager Kenny Jackett, playing 42 games in the 1996\u201397 campaign. His first major feat with the club came in the 1997\u201398 season, when new manager Graham Taylor appointed Page as captain and led the \"Hornets\" to the Second Division title. He made 49 appearances in league and cup competitions, and ensured the \"Hornets\" earned a vital point at second-place Bristol City in his final game of the season. Dropped at the start of the 1998\u201399 season in favour of Dean Yates, he soon was returned to the starting eleven alongside centre-back partner Steve Palmer and made 42 First Division appearances to help Watford to a fifth-place finish. After defeating Birmingham City in the play-off semi-finals, Page marshalled the Watford defence to a clean sheet in the final, as Watford defeated Bolton Wanderers 2\u20130 to win a place in the Premier League.
