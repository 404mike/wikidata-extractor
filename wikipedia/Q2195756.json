He played amateur golf for England but decided to represent Scotland, the country of his father, when he turned professional in 1996.\nIn the early years of his career Drummond struggled to win a regular place on the main European Tour, and spent a good deal of his time on the second tier Challenge Tour. In 2004 he claimed a surprise win in the prestigious Volvo PGA Championship, which catapulted him 340 places, from 435th to 95th in the world rankings, and gave him a five-year exemption on the European Tour. He ended the season in 23rd place on the Order of Merit, and was selected as the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year. He had a consistent 2005 season, but since then he has struggled to reproduce that form, finishing well outside the top 100 on the Order of Merit each season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Retief Goosen", "response": ["| Scott Drummond"]}, {"page": "PGA European Tour", "response": ["|align=center|2004 ||  Vijay Singh ||  Scott Drummond ||"]}, {"page": "2004 in golf", "response": ["**Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year: Scott Drummond"]}, {"page": "BMW PGA Championship", "response": ["| 2004 || Scott Drummond|| align=\"center\" |269 || align=center|\u221219 || 2 strokes ||  \u00c1ngel Cabrera ||Wentworth Club|| align=\"center\" |625,000"]}, {"page": "Mark Mouland", "response": ["| Alexandre Balicki,  Scott Drummond"]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["*1992 Scott Drummond, Andrew Farmer, Stephen Gallacher, Hugh McKibbin, David Park, Sean Quinlivan, Alan Reid, Iestyn Taylor"]}]}}
