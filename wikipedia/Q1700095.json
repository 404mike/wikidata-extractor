In his illustration of the invention, Fowler used a pair of wheels of equal diameter on each side of his vehicle, around which pair of toothed wheels ran a 'track' of eight jointed segments, with a smaller jockey/drive wheel between each pair of wheels, to support the 'track'. Comprising only eight sections, the 'track' sections are essentially 'longitudinal', as\u00a0in Boydell's initial design. Fowler's arrangement is a precursor to the multi-section caterpillar track in which a relatively large number of short 'transverse' treads are used, as proposed by Sir George Caley in 1825, rather than a small number of relatively long 'longitudinal' treads."]}, {"page": "Tractor", "response": ["The first powered farm implements in the early 19th century were portable engines \u2013 steam engines on wheels that could be used to drive mechanical farm machinery by way of a flexible belt.

The truly portable engine was invented in 1893 by William Tuxford of Boston, Lincolnshire who started manufacture of an engine built around a locomotive-style boiler with horizontal smoke tubes. A large flywheel was mounted on the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment being driven. In the 1850s, John Fowler used a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine to drive apparatus in the first public demonstrations of the application of cable haulage to cultivation."]}, {"page": "1826 in science", "response": ["* July 7 \u2013 John Fowler (died 1864), English agricultural engineer."]}, {"page": "1856 in science", "response": ["* English agricultural engineer John Fowler first demonstrates his steam-driven agricultural ploughing system."]}, {"page": "1864 in science", "response": ["* December 12 \u2013 John Fowler (born 1826), English agricultural engineer."]}, {"page": "Traction engine", "response": ["The man credited with the invention of the ploughing engine, in the mid-nineteenth century, was John Fowler, an English agricultural engineer and inventor.
