He is a right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper. He has played for Loughborough UCCE, Derbyshire, the Yorkshire Cricket Board and Durham.\nHe debuted for Derbyshire against his home county in the Second XI Championship in 2003; he has appeared consistently in the competition ever since. Goddard made his County Championship debut in September 2004, but did not appear again in the competition for two more years, instead concentrating on the Second XI.

Goddard holds the Durham record for the fastest half-century, reaching 50 in 32 balls versus Sri Lanka A on 10 August 2007.
