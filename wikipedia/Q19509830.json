She moved to London to teach drawing flowers and insects. She showed her work as a botanist at the Royal Academy and the Royal Watercolour Society, and published Exotic plants from the Royal Gardens at Kew in 1790, which she dedicated to Queen Charlotte. A large collection of work is now part of the Kew Herbarium, with further botanicals by Margaret Meen in the collections of The Vyne (National Trust) and the Royal Horticultural Society (London).Her painting A group of flowers in a jar and a bird's nest, which she painted in 1806 for Princess Elizabeth, was included in the 1905 book Women Painters of the World.Margaret Meen continued teaching, at schools and in homes of private pupils, throughout the 1820s.
