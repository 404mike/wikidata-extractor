These women could be unruly so Mariquita took in various offers of help.

Weale was a great help and in spare time she documented not only the lives of the women they took in but Tennant as well. She recorded the daily routine and correspondence with supporters like Gladstone. Tennant was not a fluent English speaker but she was ambitious. Tennant called Weale Sister Dorotea and she had plans to establish a religious order, but Tennant eccentric behaviour attracted no novices."]}]}}
