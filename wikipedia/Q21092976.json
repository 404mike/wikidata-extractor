Gustav Waagen describes the collection in Treasures of Art in Great Britain. Richard Ford, his great grandfather, wrote travel books on Spain. The Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan was an ancestor.", "Benjamin Booth, Brinsley's ancestor, began collecting works of art in the 18th century, most notably the bulk of Richard Wilson's English landscapes. It was further enhanced when Marianne, his daughter, was married to Richard Ford. Brinsley Ford added paintings, sculptures and ceramics to the collection. Works were made during the Baroque and Renaissance periods, including works of Old Masters. He has works of students of the Royal Academy of Arts that line the walls of his bedroom, from floor to ceiling. Ford enjoyed the tours he gave of the collection at his Wyndham Place house. He provided background stories about his collection, given with \"the measured cadences of Edward Gibbon with the humorous sparkle of Horace Walpole\" as he took visitors through rooms that held collection items."]}, {"page": "Booth, Benjamin", "response": ["#redirectBenjamin Booth"]}, {"page": "James Ford (translator)", "response": ["He was the son of Sir Richard Ford, police magistrate in London and Member of Parliament, and his wife Marianne Booth, an artist and daughter of Benjamin Booth; Richard Ford (1796\u20131858) was his elder brother.
