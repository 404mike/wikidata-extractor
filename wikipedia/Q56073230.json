His team complied, putting up a sound defensive display to secure a goalless draw away to West Bromwich Albion. Visitors Hull City scored two first-half goals before Bela replaced Kieftenbeld at half-time and Birmingham levelled the scores. Hull regained the lead when the defensive wall jumped over Herbie Kane's  free kick, but Gardner's 88th-minute header from Bela's cross secured a draw. A 3\u20130 defeat at home to relegation rivals Huddersfield Town preceded a visit to Fulham, who were without star striker Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107, in which Bellingham might have had an early hat-trick and Camp put in an excellent performance to hold Fulham out until the fifth minute of stoppage time. Jutkiewicz scored after five minutes against Swansea City, but increasingly characteristic defensive frailty, particularly in home matches, led to a 3\u20131 loss, after which board and Clotet came to a mutual agreement to part ways immediately. With four matches left and four points above the relegation zone, professional development coach Steve Spooner and first-team coach Craig Gardner took caretaker charge. Jutkiewicz denied that the players had been adversely affected by knowing that Clotet would be leaving, and stated that they needed to take collective responsibility for what happened on the pitch."]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Herbie Kane"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["|Herbie Kane", "|8 ||||CM||Herbie Kane                                             ||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||0", "| 16 October 2020 || CM ||  || Herbie Kane ||  Liverpool || Undisclosed || "]}]}}
