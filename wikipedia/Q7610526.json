Drawing guidance from the Convention, the proportionality test requires (1) that the objective of the action must be sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right; (2) that the action designed to meet the objective must be rationally connected to that objective, and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations; and (3) the means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the legitimate objective, and the more severe the deleterious effects of an action, the more important the objective must be if the action is to be justified.. As the European Convention was given effect in the domestic law of the UK by the Human Rights Act 1998, the proportionality approach resonated with the courts which were familiar in applying the test in cases involving qualified Convention rights across a wide spectrum of factual and policy contexts. For instance, the proportionality approach was applied by Justice Stephen Silber in R. (X) v. Head Teacher and Governors of Y School (2007).."]}, {"page": "Silber", "response": ["*Stephen Silber (born 1944), British judge"]}, {"page": "Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004", "response": ["Section 19 dealt the problem of so-called \"sham marriages\", where immigrants marry British citizens merely to gain leave to stay.
