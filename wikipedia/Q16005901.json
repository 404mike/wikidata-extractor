A left-handed all-rounder who at various points in his career bowled left-arm orthodox spin and medium-paced inswingers, he played in 437 first-class matches, the majority for Kent County Cricket Club. Making his debut for the county in 1927, Todd found opportunities limited until 1933 when he scored more than 1,000 runs in a season for the first time. He took over 80 wickets in five successive seasons, completing the double in 1937.\nThe Second World War saw Todd serve in the Royal Air Force, while also playing in charity matches for various sides. Following the war, he moved to the top of the batting order with great success, scoring over 2,000 runs in 1947, before he was forced to retire with eye problems in 1950. He briefly became a highly regarded umpire, before later moving into business. He died in Buckland, Kent in 1967.", "link_mentions": {}}}
