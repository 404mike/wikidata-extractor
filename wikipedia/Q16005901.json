A left-handed all-rounder who at various points in his career bowled left-arm orthodox spin and medium-paced inswingers, he played in 437 first-class matches, the majority for Kent County Cricket Club. Making his debut for the county in 1927, Todd found opportunities limited until 1933 when he scored more than 1,000 runs in a season for the first time. He took over 80 wickets in five successive seasons, completing the double in 1937.\nThe Second World War saw Todd serve in the Royal Air Force, while also playing in charity matches for various sides. Following the war, he moved to the top of the batting order with great success, scoring over 2,000 runs in 1947, before he was forced to retire with eye problems in 1950. He briefly became a highly regarded umpire, before later moving into business. He died in Buckland, Kent in 1967.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ray Lindwall with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Lindwall made only one in a total of 361. The paceman took two wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5/16, before they were all out for 51; Lindwall ended with 2/16. Forced to follow on, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets; the victims included Tony Pawson and former Test wicket-keeper Les Ames. The hosts were further hampered by the absence of opener Leslie Todd, who had been hit on the foot by a Lindwall swinging yorker in the first innings. The blow caused so much bruising that Todd's foot could not fit inside his cricket boots. Lindwall ended with 4/25 as Kent fell for 124 to lose by an innings. In his match total of 6/41 from 15 overs, Lindwall bowled four of his victims.Perry (2008), p. 249. The Kent fixture was followed by a match against the Gentlemen of England. Lindwall was not required to bat, and after taking 1/39 in the first innings, Bradman allowed him to rest as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Somerset, which resulted in another innings victory for the tourists. The paceman returned against the South of England\u2014a representative team\u2014scoring an unbeaten 17 in an unbroken 61-run stand with Sam Loxton before Australia declared at 7/522. He then took 1/45 as rain ended the match at the conclusion of the hosts' second innings."]}, {"page": "Les Todd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leslie Todd"]}, {"page": "Alan Watt (cricketer)", "response": ["Born in Limpsfield Chart, Watt's first-class career began while Kent's star spin bowler Tich Freeman was at the height of his powers. Watt was therefore used primarily to take the shine off the ball in preparation for Freeman's imminent bowling spell. After the retirement of Freeman, Watt struck up an effective opening bowling partnership with all-rounder Leslie Todd, and took 108 wickets in the 1937 season. A tireless bowler, Watt could achieve late swing, which accounted for many of his victims."]}, {"page": "East of England cricket team", "response": ["* Leslie Todd (1948)"]}]}}
