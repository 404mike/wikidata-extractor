In reality, his aims were radically different from Sullivan's. In his determination that the new institution should succeed as a training ground for orchestral players, Grove had two principal allies: the violinist Henry Holmes and the composer and conductor Charles Villiers Stanford. They believed that a capable college orchestra would not only benefit instrumental students, but would give students of composition the essential chance to experience the sound of their music. The college's first intake of scholarship students included 28 who studied an orchestral instrument. The potential strength of the college orchestra, including fee-paying instrumental students, was 33 violins, five violas, six cellos, one double bass, one flute, one oboe and two horns. Grove appointed 12 professors of orchestral instruments, in addition to distinguished teachers in other musical disciplines including Jenny Lind (singing), Hubert Parry (composition), Ernst Pauer (piano), Arabella Goddard (piano) and Walter Parratt (organ)."]}, {"page": "Charles Villiers Stanford", "response": ["In 1883, the Royal College of Music was set up to replace the short-lived and unsuccessful National Training School for Music (NTSM).Wright, David. \"The South Kensington Music Schools and the Development of the British Conservatoire in the Late Nineteenth Century\", Journal of the Royal Musical Association, Vol. 130, No. 2 (2005), pp. 236\u2013282  Neither the NTSM nor the longer-established Royal Academy of Music had provided adequate musical training for professional orchestral players, and the founder-director of the college, George Grove, was determined that the new institution should succeed in doing so. His two principal allies in this undertaking were the violinist Henry Holmes and Stanford. In a study of the founding of the college, David Wright notes that Stanford had two main reasons for supporting Grove's aim. The first was his belief that a capable college orchestra was essential to give students of composition the chance to experience the sound of their music. His second reason was the severe contrast between the competence of German orchestras and the performance of their British counterparts. He accepted Grove's offer of the posts of professor of composition and (with Holmes) conductor of the college orchestra. He held the professorship for the rest of his life; among the best known of his many pupils were Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, John Ireland, Rebecca Clarke,Ponder, Michael. \"Clarke, Rebecca Helferich (1886\u20131979)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 21 December 2011  Frank Bridge and Arthur Bliss."]}, {"page": "Louis Spohr", "response": ["Like Haydn, Mozart, and his own slightly older contemporary Hummel, Spohr was an active Freemason.The Harvard Dictionary of Music, edited by Don Michael Randel, 4th ed.

By 1870, the group under Congreve was based at Chapel Street Hall in London. The barrister Frederic Harrison, who had met Congreve at Wadham College, Oxford, was a founding member, but he found it difficult to adhere to Congreve's rigid Comtism. In 1878 the group suffered a schism. That summer, Congreve dissolved the Society, for he wished to make sure everyone involved in the group advocated Auguste Comte's Religion of Humanity. He had founded the 'Church of Humanity' in January 1859 and was dissatisfied with the reluctance of the society to support his cause. In 1878, the Society's members published a range of attacks on one another, including Congreve's Circular Addressed to all my Coreligionists, to all the Disciples of Auguste Comte; E.S. Beesly's Remarks on Dr Congreve's Circular; and John Henry Bridges' Appeal to English Positivists. Beesly, Bridges, Harrison, and Vernon Lushington, among others, carried on as the London Positivist Society, expanding the group's membership to 93 members by 1891. In 1881, London Positivist Society boasted a new home at Fleur-de-lis Court, off Fetter Lane, Fleet Street, London. It was called Newton Hall after Sir Isaac Newton, who had first acquired it for the Royal Society Museum. Newton Hall became a popular Positivist center distinct from Congreve's Chapel Street Hall 'Church of Humanity' for the years to come. In 1883, the Newton Hall group formed a choir for positivist ceremonies, and they appointed Henry Holmes to compose a cantata of George Eliot's poem, 'The Choir Invisible' for these purposes."]}, {"page": "Selwyn Jepson", "response": ["Selwyn Jepson (25 November 1899 \u2013 10 March 1989) was an English mystery and detective author and screenwriter.
