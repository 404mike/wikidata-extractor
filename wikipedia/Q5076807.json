Lloyd George's view in his own \"War Memoirs\" was essentially similar,Jeffery 2006, p. 292. although he wrote that Wilson was reluctant to take responsibility for decisions.", "Sir Charles Deedes later (in September 1968) wrote that Wilson's energy and foresight in 1910\u201314 had ensured that Britain would take her place alongside France when war came. An alternative view, aired as early as the 1920s, is that Wilson locked Britain into a continental commitment which Kitchener would rather have avoided or minimised.Jeffery 2006, p. 85. Jeffery is critical of some historians \u2013 e.g. Zara Steiner in Britain and the Origins of the First World War, Gerhard Ritter in The Sword and the Sceptre \u2013 who take an oversimplified view of Wilson as a supporter of the French position. Although Wilson's verbal fluency and charm brought him great influence, his position was also supported by most of his military colleagues and by the most influential members of the Cabinet. Furthermore, this ignores Wilson's interest in reaching a military agreement with Belgium.Jeffery 2006, p. 99."]}, {"page": "53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division", "response": ["|Major-General Charles Deedes"]}, {"page": "Military Secretary (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Deedes, 1934\u20131937"]}, {"page": "Philip Pleydell-Bouverie", "response": ["*Letitia Anne, who married Rev.
