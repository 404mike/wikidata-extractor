Henry was born at Bocton Hall in the parish of Bocton or Boughton Malherbe, Kent.  He was educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 5 June 1584,  'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500\u20131714: Woodall-Wyvill', Alumni Oxonienses 1500\u20131714 (1891), pp. 1674\u20131697.

At Oxford he was the friend of Alberico Gentili, then professor of Civil Law, and of John Donne. During his residence at Queen's he wrote a play, Tancredo, which has not survived, but his chief interests appear to have been scientific. In qualifying for his M.A. degree he read three lectures De oculo, and to the end of his life he continued to interest himself in physical experiments."]}, {"page": "Wotton", "response": ["*Nicholas Wotton, English diplomat"]}, {"page": "Treaty of Edinburgh", "response": ["The representatives were Jean de Monluc, Bishop of Valence, and Charles de la Rochefoucault, Sieur de Randan, for France, with William Cecil and Nicholas Wotton, Dean of Canterbury and York.HMC Salisbury, Hatfield Manuscripts, vol. i (1883), 245\u20136.

Paul Friedmann, Venice, 1869. In January 1555\u20136 Thirlby took a part in the degradation of his old friend Archbishop Cranmer. \"He was observed to weep much all the while; he protested to Cranmer that it was the most sorrowful action of his whole life, and acknowledged the great love and friendship that had been between them; and that no earthly consideration but the queen's command could have induced him to come and do what they were then about.\" cites: Burnet, i. 531. On 22 March following he was one of the seven bishops who assisted at the consecration of Cardinal Pole as archbishop of Canterbury. In 1556 he was appointed to receive Osep Napea Gregoriwitch (ru), ambassador from the emperor of Russia. Thirlby appears to have sanctioned the burning of John Hullier for heresy in 1556, but only two others suffered death in his diocese on account of their religion, and it has been said that \"Thirleby was in no way interested therein; but the guilt thereof must be shared between Dr. Fuller, the chancellor, and other commissioners.\" cites: Fuller, Church Hist. ed. 1837, i. 395. In April 1558 Thirlby was sent to the north to inquire the cause of the quarrel between the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland. He and Dr. Nicholas Wotton were Queen Mary's commissioners to treat with France respecting the restoration of Calais and the conclusion of peace. Queen Elizabeth sent a new commission to them at Cambray in January 1558\u20139, and instructed the Earl of Arundel to act in conjunction with them. The commissioners succeeded in concluding peace, and returned home in April 1559. The queen is said to have cast upon Thirlby the entire blame of the eventual loss of Calais. cites: Strype, Life of Whitgift, i. 229.

In his household he spent every fortnight forty bushels of corn, twenty bushels of malt and an ox, besides a proportional quantity of other kinds of provisions.

In addition, at some time before 1567, Nicholas Wotton, Dean of Canterbury, made numerous extracts from the Salacronica (BL MS Harley 902).
