Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Andres Salaff. According to Wolfhard, the episode was largely the \"baby\" of Herpich; he alone wrote the outline for the story, and he also designed the eponymous character. Herpich later revealed that he was inspired to write an episode concerning the origin of the ice crown after reading Joe Daly's graphic novel Dungeon Quest Book Three, which featured a plot involving Atlantan alchemists. Herpich thought it would be interesting to write an episode of Adventure Time about the forging of the crown in the distant past on the lost island of Atlantis. Herpich's original plot for the episode intertwined this version of the crown's origin with a story about Ice King remembering the prehistoric events. However, the episode was eventually streamlined, and all references to Atlantis were stripped away.Thomas (2020), p. 69, note 57."]}, {"page": "Joe Daly", "response": ["Joe Daly may refer to:", "* Joe Daly (comics) (born 1979), South African comics artist", "* Joe Daly (baseball) (1868-1943), American baseball player", "* Joe Daly (footballer) (1897\u20131941), English footballer "]}, {"page": "CityVarsity", "response": ["* Joe Daly"]}]}}
