He had some loose free-form ideas by the mid-1950s, but finally settled upon his conception in 1959, after a protracted spell in hospital with tuberculosis. At first he struggled to recruit other like-minded musicians to his vision. Indeed, two of his core band members, Harry South and Hank Shaw, left when these ideas surfaced. He finally settled on a line-up of Shake Keane (trumpet, flugelhorn), Pat Smythe (piano), Coleridge Goode (bass) and Phil Seamen (drums). Les Condon temporarily replaced Keane on trumpet in 1961, while Seamen left permanently the same year, his place taken by the return of the quintet's previous drummer, Bobby Orr. Frank Holder toured with Harriott and contributed to recording projects during this period."]}, {"page": "Pat Smythe (pianist)", "response": ["After working briefly with the Jamaican trumpeter Dizzy Reece, in May 1960 he joined the quintet led by another Jamaican, alto saxophonist Joe Harriott. Harriott was in the process of reshaping his band in order to begin playing his revolutionary brand of free jazz, and recruited Smythe specifically for his willingness and ability to play this music, which was unheard of in Europe at the time. Smythe's graceful, lyrical phrases were the perfect complement to Harriott's increasingly abstract playing, and also to the explosive trumpet and fl\u00fcgelhorn of Shake Keane. Smythe, bassist Coleridge Goode and drummers Phil Seamen and (later) Bobby Orr combined effortlessly to bring full realisation to Harriott's conception of complete ensemble interaction, at the expense of traditional roles of soloist and accompanist. Smythe's pivotal role highlighted one of the principal differences between Harriott and his American counterpart Ornette Coleman, who viewed the harmonic qualities of the piano, as incompatible with his own brand of free improvisation."]}, {"page": "Lal\u00e9na", "response": ["\"Lal\u00e9na\" was recorded in a September 1968 session at Olympic Studios produced by Mickie Most, session personnel being Harold McNair on flute, Bobby Orr on drums, Danny Thompson on bass with the Royal Philharmonic strings; John Cameron was the arranger.
