He joined Bradford City in 2007, and later the same year scored with his first touch in league football. He played on loan for Cambridge City, but left Bradford after just one season to return to London, and re-signed for Barnet.

Holdsworth wasted no time making his mark on the team, bringing in forwards Peter Vincenti, Tim Sills, and Alex Rodman \u2013 as well as defender Simon Grand on loan from Fleetwood \u2013 before the end of the month. There were also players leaving the club during this period of transition, with both Glen Little and Wesley Ngo Baheng being released, whilst Anthony Straker and Damian Spencer were sent out on loan. Holdsworth's first game in charge resulted in a creditable 1\u20131 draw away to high-flying Bury, and he also improved on Aldershot's poor home form; winning his first game at \"The Rec\" 1\u20130 against Bradford City, whilst a last-minute Luke Guttridge free-kick gave the \"Shots\" a second consecutive home win 3\u20132 against Crewe. He continued attempting to strengthen the squad throughout February, with loan signings Albert Jarrett and Luke Medley from Lincoln and Mansfield respectively, though neither had a large impact on the team with only a handful of appearances between them. Holdsworth also signed former \"Shots\" goalkeeper Mikhael Jaimez-Ruiz, who made 62 appearances in a previous spell at the club.

After going unbeaten in January, the club were still 15th in League Two, and McCall told the Telegraph & Argus he did not regret his pre-season target but was carried away with the euphoria at the time.

He made his debut in a Football League Trophy game against Doncaster Rovers on 4 September 2007 which Bradford lost 5\u20131. Despite Taylforth's first team chances being limited, City manager Stuart McCall said the youngster was one to keep an eye on. Taylforth's second game was his FA Cup debut when he came on as a substitute in Bradford's second round defeat against Tranmere Rovers in December 2007. A month later he joined Conference National side Droylsden on loan. He made his debut for Droylsden as a second-half substitute the following day against Cambridge City, for whom Bradford teammate Luke Medley was also making his debut in a loan spell, with Droylsden winning 1\u20130 in the FA Trophy. He also played two Conference National league games during his loan spell before returning to Bradford in February. A month later he joined Northern Premier League Premier Division side Guiseley on another month-long loan deal. He made his debut for Guiseley as a second-half substitute on 24 March 2008 in a 0\u20130 draw with Stamford. The following week he scored his first goal, with the final goal of a 2\u20132 draw with Fleetwood Town. He was one of three junior players to be offered a new deal by manager Stuart McCall on 29 April 2008, and was rewarded with his first league appearance four days later in City's 2\u20131 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers on the final day of the 2007\u201308 season."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["Bradford started their league season on 11 August 2007 with a 1\u20131 draw with Macclesfield Town, when a crowd of 14,345 was inside Valley Parade, 1,000 more than was originally announced.

Macclesfield had taken the lead, with City equalising shortly before half-time when Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu scored with a rebound after Barry Conlon's penalty was saved. Four days later City were at Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, for the first round of the League Cup. Wolves scored twice in the first five minutes of the second half, and despite Kyle Nix pulling one back for Bradford, City went out 2\u20131.

Craig Bentham, who had spent three months on loan at Farsley Celtic, and Scott Phelan, who had not featured since December, were also deemed surplus to requirements.
