That leaves in-between a rather large, elongated piece of land. In the 1870s, the Admiralty Dock was built on that stretch of land. Prior to its construction, the then governor, Sir Arthur Kennedy discussed the possibility of running a narrow public road through this land with the military officials but was rejected to protect military secrecy. Kennedy Road in the Mid-Levels was built as a replacement. Then for decades numerous attempts by different governors negotiating on this matter failed."]}, {"page": "South Brisbane, Queensland", "response": ["In October 1875 the congregation of St Thomas' decided to erect a new church in a more \"central\" location, apparently desiring a more elevated site and a more \"pretentious\" church. In November 1877 a building site was obtained on the corner of Vulture Street and Cordelia Street (). In June 1878 the church officials selected Andrea Strombuco's design for the new church. The foundation stone for the new St Andrew's Anglican Church was laid on Saturday 30 November 1878 by Queensland Governor Arthur Kennedy. After delays in construction due to insufficient money, the new church was officially opened and dedicated on Wednesday 6 June 1883 by Bishop Matthew Hale assisted by Archdeacon Benjamin Glennie with over 500 people present. St Thomas' church then closed."]}, {"page": "Arthur E. Kennedy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Kennedy (colonial administrator)"]}]}}
