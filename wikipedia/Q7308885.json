He made 35 and 14 in Worcestershire's 54-run victory, and played five further matches that summer, his top score being 40 in a loss to Oxford University. Swalwell played six times in 1908, hitting 57 against Oxford University, but then did not appear again in first-class cricket until 1913, playing five times in total in that and the following season, four games being for Worcestershire and one for MCC.\nAfter the First World War, he played a single match for Worcestershire in 1920, then played on for several years for MCC, making a career-best 72 against Cambridge University in 1921. Swalwell also made one appearance for Gentlemen of England against the Combined Services in 1920, and in this game he took all his three first-class wickets (Tom Jameson, Charles Blount and Noel Carbutt). His final first-class game was for MCC against Wales in 1925: he made 0 and 5, and his nine wicketless overs cost 45 runs.\nOutside cricket, Swalwell reached the rank of major in the Army.\n\nHe died at Broomhall, Sunningdale, Berkshire at the age of 57.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Reginald Swalwell "]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1895\u20131914)", "response": ["* Reginald Swalwell (1914\u20131925) : R.
