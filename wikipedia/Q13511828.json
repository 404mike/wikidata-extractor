O'Malley issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\", and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\", a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into Yugoslavia in the trunk of O'Malley's Chrysler.  Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his Opel across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in Belgrade, where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to Sofia, Bulgaria. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attach\u00e9 Aidan Crawley. The couple gave Crawley rolls of microfilm which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"Musketeers\". The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the Soviet Union, indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941."]}, {"page": "George Mallory", "response": ["One of Mallory's closest friends and climbing companions was a young woman named Cottie Sanders, who became a novelist with the pseudonym of Ann Bridge.

She subsequently wrote Good Food from Spain and Portugal (1956) and Portugal: A Travellers' Guide (1982), as well as annually revising Fodor's Guide to Portugal. Lowndes also wrote two small books on Fatima for thousands of English-speaking pilgrims. She often gave lectures on Portuguese topics in Portugal and Britain. Together with her elder sister, Elizabeth, Countess of Iddesleigh, she edited The Diaries and Letters of Marie Belloc Lowndes (1971), which described the atmosphere of the interwar years in London. English Art in Portugal, written together with Alice Berkeley, was published posthumously in 1994."]}]}}
