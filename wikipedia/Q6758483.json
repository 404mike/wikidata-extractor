His work is very highly cited, and influential in the fields of palaeogenomics, evolutionary genomics and evolutionary hologenomics. He is currently the Director of the University of Copenhagen's Center for Evolutionary HologenomicsHe received a  BA in Biological Sciences at Oriel College, Oxford University in 2000, and a D.Phil. (Doctor of Philosophy) from the Zoology Dept and at New College, Oxford University in 2004 under Alan Cooper. Subsequently, he was a post-doctoral fellow with Michael Worobey at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, at the University of Arizona, where he undertook genetic analyses on samples containing some of the earliest recorded HIV-1 infected tissues. In 2005, he became an Assistant Professor at the University of Copenhagen, where he has been Professor of Palaeogenomics since 2011, initially at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, and subsequently at the GLOBE Institute. In 2020 he founded and became the first Director of the https://dg.dk/ Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics. He is also a Professor II at NTNU University Museum (Trondheim, Norway). He is currently an Associate Editor of the journals, Evolution, Medicine and Public Health, and Methods in Ecology and Evolution, and a former editor of the journals PLOS One, Environmental DNA, Open Quaternary and Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences. He is a member of the Editorial Board for Current Biology. and an elected member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ancient DNA", "response": ["In June 2013, a group of researchers including Eske Willerslev, Marcus Thomas Pius Gilbert and Orlando Ludovic of the Centre for Geogenetics, Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen, announced that they had sequenced the DNA of a 560\u2013780 thousand year old horse, using material extracted from a leg bone found buried in permafrost in Canada's Yukon territory. A German team also reported in 2013 the reconstructed mitochondrial genome of a bear, Ursus deningeri, more than 300,000 years old, proving that authentic ancient DNA can be preserved for hundreds of thousand years outside of permafrost.  The DNA sequence of even older nuclear DNA was reported in 2021 from the permafrost-preserved teeth of two Siberian mammoths, both over a million years old."]}, {"page": "Thomas Gilbert", "response": ["* Marcus Thomas Pius Gilbert (born 1977), also known as Tom Gilbert, British evolutionary biologist"]}, {"page": "M.
