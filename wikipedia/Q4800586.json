The Latin  (\"container; refuge\") would literally describe a bear's lair or cage, which seems unlikely. Bartrum gives the translation as \"driver of a chariot belonging to a bear's den\". Those seeking an identification of Arthur with Cuneglasus's putative father Owain have seen it as reference to Cuneglasus's guiding the chariot containing his father's casket. In 1918, historian Arthur Wade-Evans theorized that the \"bear's den\" was actually the township of Dinerth in Llandrillo-yn-Rhos (Rhos-on-Sea). The name \"Dinerth\" can be translated to a \"bear's fortress\". Excavations undertaken in 1997 by David Longley for the Gwynedd Archaeological Trust revealed an early medieval fortress with a \"massive, well-built\" wall of quarried limestone standing  high and fronted by a rampart of  of rubble. The phrase would then serve as a punning reference to the main court of Cuneglasus.
