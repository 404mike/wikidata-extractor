Writings of ancient civilizations include evidence of their acquaintance with dropsy and heart failure: Egyptians were the first to use bloodletting to relieve fluid accumulation and shortage of breath, and provided what may have been the first documented observations on heart failure in the Ebers papurus (around 1500 BCE); Greeks described cases of dyspnea, fluid retention and fatigue compatible with heart failure; Romans used the flowering plant Drimia maritima (sea squill), which contains cardiac glycosides, for the treatment of dropsy; descriptions pertaining to heart failure are also known in the civilizations of ancient India and China. However, the manifestations of failing heart were understood in the context of these peoples' medical theories - including ancient Egyptian religion, Hippocratic theory of humours, or ancient Indian and Chinese medicine, and the current concept of heart failure had not developed yet. Although shortage of breath had been connected to heart disease by Avicenna round 1000 CE, decisive for modern understanding of the nature of the condition were the description of pulmonary circulation by Ibn al-Nafis in the 13th century, and of systemic circulation by William Harvey in 1628. The role of the heart in fluid retention began to be better appreciated, as dropsy of the chest (fluid accumulation in and round the lungs causing shortage of breath) became more familiar and the current concept of heart failure, which brings together swelling and shortage of breath due to fluid retention, began to be accepted, in the 17th and especially in the 18th century: Richard Lower linked dyspnea and foot swelling in 1679, and Giovanni Maria Lancisi connected jugular vein distention with right venticular failure in 1728. Dropsy attributable to other causes, e.g. kidney failure, was differentiated in the 19th century. The stethoscope, invented by Ren\u00e9 Laennec in 1819, x-rays, discovered by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen in 1895, and electrocardiography, described by Willem Einthoven in 1903, facilitated the investigation of heart failure. 19th century also saw experimental and conceptual advances in the physiology of heart contraction, which led to the formulation of the Frank-Starling law of the heart (named after physiologists Otto Frank and Ernest Starling, a remarkable advance in understanding mechanisms of heart failure."]}, {"page": "Library of Sir Thomas Browne", "response": ["*Richard Lower, De Corde: item de motu & colore sanguinis, London 1670"]}, {"page": "1691 in science", "response": ["* January 17 \u2013 Richard Lower, English physician who performed the first direct blood transfusion (born 1631)"]}, {"page": "1672 in science", "response": ["* Richard Lower publishes De Catarrhis, the first scholarly attempt by an English physician to take a classical doctrine (the theory that nasal catarrh is caused by secretions overspilling from the brain) and to disprove it by scientific experiment."]}, {"page": "1669 in science", "response": ["* Richard Lower publishes his Tractatus de Corde on the workings of the heart."]}, {"page": "1631 in science", "response": ["* Richard Lower, English physician who performed the first direct blood transfusion (died 1691)"]}, {"page": "List of physicians", "response": ["* Richard Lower (1631\u20131691) \u2014 studied the lungs and heart, and performed the first blood transfusion"]}, {"page": "List of people from Cornwall", "response": ["* Richard Lower, blood transfusion pioneerMarcus B.

Dropsy is the morbid effusion of the serum of the blood into the cavities of the body and into the meshes of its tissues. It had been observed from the beginning of medicine, but up to the time of Richard Lower nothing was known of its morbid anatomy. He made the first step, which was the demonstration that dropsy of a limb always follows direct obstruction of its veins. Blackall's discovery came next, and was that dropsy is often associated with the presence of albumen in the urine. His treatise states clearly the relation between albuminuria and dropsy, and shows that he suspected that the kidneys were diseased in these cases. The further discovery of Richard Bright in 1836 of the constant relation between renal disease and albuminuria is based upon the observations first made by Blackall."]}, {"page": "Richard Lower", "response": ["Richard Lower may refer to:", "* Richard Lower (physician) (1631\u20131691), British physician", "* Richard Lower (poet) (1782\u20131865), English dialect poet", "* Richard Lower (surgeon) (1929\u20132008), American cardiac surgeon"]}, {"page": "1631 in England", "response": ["* Richard Lower, physician who performs the first direct blood transfusion (died 1691)"]}, {"page": "Stephen Dugdale", "response": ["Dugdale was understood to be willing to appear as a witness against the Whig  leader Shaftesbury, who had undoubtedly used the Plot for his own political ends, and was seen by the King as his principal opponent.
