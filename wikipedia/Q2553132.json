He also discovered two shafts out from the Queen's Chamber of the Great Pyramid, similar to those that connect the King's Chamber to the outside wall of the pyramid, although these don't extend all the way.Outside of his interest in Egypt, he worked as a manager of Sir Raylton Dixon & Co, a Cleveland-based shipbuilding company, alongside his brothers in Middlesbrough: he retired from the board of the company in 1917. He also served as an honorary consul of Japan in later life. One brother, John Dixon (1835\u20131891), designed the cylinder that transported Cleopatra's Needle from Egypt to London, and Waynman himself was tasked with building it around the obelisk. The other brother, Sir Raylton Dixon, was also an engineer and shipbuilder, and served as Mayor of Middlesbrough.", "link_mentions": {}}}
