After a visit to Ottawa, to present himself directly for this project, Dunsmuir went off to Scotland.  While in Scotland, Dunsmuir received the news that the provincial government had chosen the Vancouver Land and Railway Company controlled by Clement for the job. Dunsmuir was surprised that Clement would take the contract without a cash grant in addition to the land and commit to building the railway to Seymour Narrows, near Campbell River.Reksten p 59.

Moberly was sought out by Joseph Trutch, British Columbia's first provincial Lieutenant-Governor, and invited back to organize surveys for the railway.  His survey crews headed out into the wilderness on the day the province joined confederation.  Moberly's survey crews were responsible for the territory around what is now Eagle Pass, Revelstoke, and Golden.  From the time of his discovery of Eagle Pass, he formed the conviction that this was the best route for the railway.  However, Sandford Fleming, Chief Engineer of the railway project, asked Moberly to relocate his crews north to the Yellowhead Pass for the 1872 season.  Moberly was very frustrated with these orders requiring him to abandon his preferred route."]}, {"page": "Ashcott", "response": ["Ashcott was the birthplace of Joseph Trutch, a Canadian engineer, surveyor and politician.

He felt that the St\u00f3\ua789l\u014d did not need most of the land promised to them by Douglas and McColl. Trutch believed that if the land was not being used for agrarian purposes it was not required. He reduced the reserves by 91% in 1867, siding with the settlers who had begun to build homes and farms in the area. Trutch also took many of the rights that Douglas had given to the St\u00f3\ua789l\u014d  away. They no longer were allowed to participate in government or able to pre-empt or purchase land outside of the reserves. In the years following these events the federal and provincial governments have paid very little attention to the problems that First Nations people have been experiencing in British Columbia. In 1990 British Columbia acknowledged that Aboriginal rights to land and resources needed to be extinguished by treaty as stated in the 1763 Royal Proclamation.
