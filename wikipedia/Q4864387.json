Both Cowdrey and the Australian captain Bill Lawry were unfit for the Fourth Test, which was drawn when England finished on 230/4 needing 326.

As the ball was swinging at the Oval that season he wanted the bowlers Tom Cartwright and Barry Knight, but they were both unfit and the opener Roger Prideaux caught a virus of the eve of the Test.

The fast bowler John Snow would take 31 wickets (22.83) in the 1970\u201371 Ashes series, but he was not chosen for the tour and went to South Africa to play club cricket. Brown was 6'4\" tall and was noted for his steep bounce and was regarded as England's best new ball bowler, his 5/63 forced Australia to follow on in the Third Test at Sydney. The Scottish seamer David Larter was even taller at 6'\u00a07\" and had a ridiculously long run, but he lacked self-confidence, and an ankle injury on the tour ended his career. Jeff Jones was a Welsh left-arm bowler of genuine pace and the father of Simon Jones he took 6/118 in the Fourth Test, but troubled the umpires by running on the pitch and was not really of Test class.

With England's bowlers laid low, the all-rounder Barry Knight was called up. A veteran of the 1962\u201363 Ashes series, he liked to drop the ball short, but lacked the pace to worry the Australians. Even so, he took 4/84 in the Second Test when the hosts were out for 358 on a flat wicket. Geoff Boycott was a useful medium-paced bowler in his youth, known to wear his cap backwards as he bowled, and was used as the third new ball bowler in the Third and Fourth Tests.

Elsewhere they were expensive and could only be used for containment. Ken Barrington had started life as a leg-spinner and was a good bowler at club level, as was Bob Barber, and commentators thought they should have been used more widely considering England's poor attack, but Smith only tried them when a draw was a foregone conclusion."]}, {"page": "1963 English cricket season", "response": ["|| Barry Knight ||align=\"right\"| 6743 ||align=\"right\"| 207 ||align=\"right\"| 3042 ||align=\"right\"| 140 || 21.72"]}, {"page": "1965 English cricket season", "response": [" || Barry Knight ||align=\"right\"| 6098 ||align=\"right\"| 216 ||align=\"right\"| 2363 ||align=\"right\"| 125 || 18.90"]}, {"page": "Pakistani cricket team in England in 1962", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Barry Knight", "Ted Dexter was restored to the captaincy but it is not known if this would have happened anyway or if it was because Colin Cowdrey was unfit and could not play.

Pullar had been brought in as a specialist opener instead of Cowdrey, who had been England's makeshift opener against Pakistan in 1962, but disliked the job and had made three successive ducks in this role so far on the tour. David Allen was dropped to make way for the extra batsman and Ray Illingworth in favour of Fred Titmus, but this was quite normal as these three off-spinners regularly displaced each other depending on current form and favour. Wicket-keeper John Murray was replaced by debutant Alan Smith due to his superior batting on tour, even though he too had been hit on the head by a Wes Hall bouncer the week before. Fast bowlers Len Coldwell and David Larter had been tried out in the Fifth Test against Pakistan at the Oval, but the old firm of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham were back in action, even though Trueman had a broken bone in his back and had been told by an Australian doctor that he would never bowl again.p282, Trueman", "The bowling began poorly, but after 20 minutes Fred Trueman (3/76) got the hang of the pitch and made the ball swing away from Bill Lawry, finding a thin edge to Alan Smith for his first catch in Test cricket. Norm O'Neill was a notoriously poor starter and would have run himself out if Ted Dexter had gathered the ball cleanly. As it was he edged Trueman to David Sheppard at second clip, who missed the catch and Peter Parfitt dropped the rebound for what would have been a superlative diving catch he held on. After cutting the ball for a scorching boundary, edging another past fine-leg and glancing another, O'Neill was out to a Trueman bouncer which lifted sharply and he was caught by Brian Statham at short square-leg for 19. Bobby Simpson made 50, but mis-hooked a rank long hop from Dexter (1/46) into the hands of Trueman at mid-on and Australia went into lunch on 97/3. Back on the field Trueman started bowling short on the leg-stump, dubbed \"bodyline\" by some journalists, and Peter Burge popped a ball to Dexter at short-leg to give the Yorkshireman his third wicket despite his bad back. Australia were now surprisingly 101/4, but Brian Booth (112) rebuilt the innings, adding 39 with Neil Harvey (39), 54 with Alan Davidson (23) and 103 the ever solid Ken Mackay. A rather lifeless Statham (1/75) bowled Harvey with a good ball, but it was the support bowlers Barry Knight, Fred Titmus and Ken Barrington who suffered in the afternoon as the fast bowlers were given a rest. Smith missed a stumping when Booth was 21 and tried to drive Titmus and also hit the spinner to the boundary over the head of a fielder. Davidson heaved Titmus to the fence, but tried the same to Barrington's leg-spin and was caught by Trueman, who had now taken three wickets and held two catches out of six dismissals. The game struggled in the final session, with Dexter setting defensive fields to Titmus and Knight and Mackay hogging the strike without making runs and too slow to take quick singles which would have upset the field-placings. Booth reached his \"wristily stylish\"p298, Ray Robinson and Mike Coward, England vs Australia 1932\u20131985, Barclays World of Cricket, Willow Books, 1986 maiden Test century in 173 minutes and with 14 fours, an aristocratic innings by the man who had nearly been left carrying the drinks. He was caught by Dexter off Titmus (1/91) at 20 minutes to six trying to push the score in the face of all opposition. His departure at 296/7 brought in captain Richie Benaud, who must have wondered if his team would make 300 earlier in the day, but saw Australia to 321/7 by stumps, with Mackay reaching 51 not out. Trueman was fit to bowl in the morning, but Benaud hooked him for four and with Mackay took 11 runs off an over by Statham. When five overs had gone for 34 runs so Titmus and Knight were brought back on to defensive fields. Benaud made 51 runs before he edged the ball to Smith off Knight at 388/8. Knight (3/65) made two dives across the wicket to take return catches off Mackay, which he dropped and McKenzie, which he held on to. Jarman was caught off the Essex all-rounder by Barrington to wrap up the Australian innings for 404 in time for an early lunch, with Mackay left high and dry on 86 not out. It was his own fault as the dour Queenslander had occupied his home ground for a tedious 247 minutes, had refused singles and had allowed Dexter to contain him. Mackay never made a Test century and this was the closest he got to one against England.pp. 43\u201348, Moyespp. 99\u2013100, Titmus", "England's innings was more solid than Australia's \u2013 the first seven batsmen made 21 and three passed 50 \u2013 but fell 15 runs short in the first innings. Geoff Pullar (33) and David Sheppard (31) struggled along with Sheppard edging a ball to the ground near Alan Davidson and Pullar caught by Richie Benaud only for Barry Jarman to signal that it was not a chance. Benaud had both men floundering at times, but they stuck to their work until Benaud caught Pullar off his own bowling on 62/1 and had Sheppard taken round the corner by Garth McKenzie for 65/2. This brought Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey the crease to see out the session. After tea Dexter sent the ball crashing to the boundary ten times as he and his vice-captain added 80 runs in 76 minutes. Cowdrey (21) was willing to watch until he hooked Bobby Simpson straight into the hands of Bill Lawry and at ten to six Dexter's confidence \u2013 and the lengthening shadows \u2013 got the better of him and he drove over a ball from Benaud and was bowled for 70. Alan Smith joined Ken Barrington as a nightwatchman and they saw the day end on 169/4. Barrington thrashed six boundaries off Benaud and Simpson (1/52) in his first 25 runs the next day, adding 51 with Smith (21), who was caught behind when Garth McKenzie was brought into the attack and made several balls left awkwardly off the pitch. Barrington now reverted to his typical, grinding self, taking 210 minutes over his last 40 runs with Peter Parfitt feeling his way to 80 off 244 minutes. Finally the Surrey batsman lost his concentration and skied Benaud to Peter Burge at mid-off for 78 and was replaced by the equally pedestrian Fred Titmus, who prodded his way to 21 in 104 minutes. The end came suddenly, Titmus and Parfitt were caught off Benaud (6/115), McKenzie (3/78) had Barry Knight out for a duck and Fred Trueman for 19 after he hit a six and 2 fours adding 27 runs in 20 minutes for the last wicket with Brian Statham as 361/6 became 362/9 and 389 all out.pp. 48\u201351, Moyes and Goodman", "Fred Trueman (0/59) gave Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry a torrid time, his first ball to Simpson rolled onto the stumps, but failed to dislodge the bail and they survived the day with 16/0. They moved along to 104 by lunch, but not without a few scares. Brian Statham missed a simple caught and bowled off Simpson and Trueman's strong left arm nearly had Lawry run out while backing up. Simpson had made 109, 66 not out, 28, 122, 130, 9, 110 and 50 so far in the season and looked tired when he edged Ted Dexter (2/78) behind to the vigilant England wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 71 in a stand of 136. Norm O'Neill came in and promptly drove Dexter for 4, then hooked him for another. He took a boundary off Barry Knight and even Lawry joined in the act, hooking Statham to the boundary as they added 80 runs in 79 minutes. Knight was reduced to bowling down the leg-side without a slip and O'Neill hooked to the boundary and smashed him over mid-on, which even brought applause from Dexter. Lawry moved smoothly to 98 then hooked a long hop from Fred Titmus (1/81) into the hands of David Sheppard in the deep. Neil Harvey came out to attack the bowling \u2013 he rarely did anything else \u2013 and the runs flowed regardless of Dexter's attempts to plug the gaps. O'Neill was out to a beautiful ball from Statham (1/67) that cut back and had him lbw for 56 with 9 fours and Harvey's 57 with 6 fours ended when he tried to hit Dexter out of the ground and was caught by Statham at deep mid-off. Peter Burge (47 not out) had kept Harvey company in a stand of 84, and added 37 runs with Brian Booth (19 not out) in the last half-hour and Australia were 362/4, 377 runs ahead by the end of the fourth day. Benaud's decision to not declare and have a bowl that evening was criticised by the press and several theories were advanced as to why. Some thought he was playing mind-games with the English batsmen, giving them an uncertain and nervous night, others that he was afraid of Dexter's batting power. A more likely explanation was that Benaud had suffered a groin strain after his 42 over marathon in the first innings and he did not want to declare until he knew he would be fit on the last day. In any case after inspecting the wicket with Neil Harvey and bowling a few balls in front of the pavilion he declared ten minutes before play started. England were given 378 runs to win, a total that they have yet to make in a fourth innings against Australia.pp. 305\u2013307, E.W.

We had a discussion and thought we still stood an outside chance of a surprise win. By tea, we had changed our minds because the score had only crept to only 185 and we could hardly expect to make 196 in two hours, even with Ted Dexter still in and looking for runs. At the close Barry Knight and I were still there with 100 needed. Benaud had made it practically impossible for us to win, or for them.", "Geoff Pullar (56) and David Sheppard (53) added 114 for the first-wicket in 147 minutes, the first century opening stand for England in Australia since 1946\u201347. But they batted slowly and the left-handed Lancastrian never settled down properly. He edged a boundary through the slips, nearly chopped McKenzie onto his stumps and was dropped by Jarman. In the end Alan Davidson (3/43) slowed down his pace and had him caught and bowled after lunch. This brought Ted Dexter striding to the crease and he began to thump the ball off the boundary fence to take England to 182/2 by tea. Colin Cowdrey (9) was caught-and-bowled by Benaud (1/71) after the break, but Dexter and Ken Barrington hit 66 runs in 86 minutes to keep the game going. They were both out on 257, Dexter yorked by McKenzie (2/61) after a magnificent 99 \u2013 few doubted that he deserved a century \u2013 and Barrington caught off Davidson for 23. This ended any chance of England winning the game \u2013 they now needed 121 runs in 40 minutes \u2013 and the Australian fielders crowded around the wicket, but there was no miracle in store for them either. Peter Parfitt was caught by Jarman off McKenzie, but Fred Titmus and Barry Knight batted out the last half-hour and they finished on 278/6.pp. 54\u201356, Moyes and Goodman", "Australia kept an unchanged XI for the Second Test, but England made two changes; Peter Parfitt was replaced by the veteran Tom Graveney who had made 122 not out against South Australia and Barry Knight by Len Coldwell who had taken 6/49 in the MCC's 5-wicket win over Victoria. Parfitt had been in poor form all tour except for the slow 80 he made in the First Test, though being used as a makeshift opener had not helped. Graveney was an old hand who had toured in 1954\u201355 and 1958\u201359, while Coldwell was proving to be a better bowler than Knight, whose only advantage was that he was an all-rounder, but in a team that still had eight recognised batsman this was not too much of a loss. Alan Smith was still preferred as wicket-keeper to John Murray, though not so much as to be \"the mystery of the tour\"p81, Moyes and Goodman as though Murray was the better keeper the difference in ability was minor. Brian Statham (231), Richie Benaud (226) and Fred Trueman (219) were all approaching Alec Bedser's record of 236 Test wickets. Bedser was in Australia as England's assistant-manager, as were the only other bowlers to have taken 200 Test wickets; Clarrie Grimmett (216), whose Test record had been overtaken by Bedser in 1953, and Ray Lindwall (228), who held the Australian record.

All these were fulfilled by playing \"bush games\" against local grade cricket teams and as these sides were roughly the equivalent to Lancashire League they provided the tourists with valuable practice before taking on the state sides and Australia.

Barry Shepherd won the toss, but there was confusion over his decision to field. Ted Dexter led the MCC out, certain that Shepherd would bat and the Western Australian captain had to run out and call them back in. the big fast bowler Des Hoare (3/42) sent Colin Cowdrey and Ted Dexter back to the pavilion, the young Garth McKenzie (4/38) accounted for Tom Graveney and Ken Barrington and the MCC had lost four top batsmen for 14 runs in six overs. \"The Rev\" David Sheppard (43) and the Essex all rounder Barry Knight (65) held off the venomous attack until lunch, when Sheppard was caught by Simpson off Tony Lock (3/36), the tail failed to support Knight, and the MCC were out for 157.

These two stands made up two-thirds of the MCC's runs as they were out for 270, O'Neill's (2/30) part-time leg-breaks removed Dexter and Graveney and McKenzie (3/66) dismissed Sheppard and then took the last two wickets. Lawry and Simpson knocked off 50 runs on the same day, but Lawry retired hurt on 15 after his big toe was hit and Vernon helped Simpson (66 not out) gather in the runs, 111/0 in the MCC's first defeat at the WACA.

South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 with the help of their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 by the end of the day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster tripped over himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, but everybody else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with the stylish Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping in. A shower of rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to some quick hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end. On a flat wicket with indifferent bowling the teams made 1,221 runs in four days despite the rain.pp12-17, Moyes and Goodman", "In olden days the twin poles of Australian cricket - Melbourne and Sydney - each hosted two Tests in a season, but now that Brisbane received a Test they took it in turns to host the extra Test and the Australian XI game. The selectors chose Test hopefuls under the Australian vice-captain Neil Harvey; Grahame Thomas, Bobby Simpson, Barry Shepherd, Ian McLachlan, Frank Misson, Bob Cowper, Tom Veivers, Johnny Martin,  Barry Jarman, Colin Guest and 12th man Jack Potter. Harvey must have had bitter memories of the match four years before which cost him the Australian captaincy; Peter May made 140 and 114, Laker and Lock took 12 wickets and the MCC won by 345 runs. Ted Dexter won the toss and after the loss of Geoff Pullar at 35/1 Dexter marched out and thrashed 102 off 110 minutes, hitting 2 sixes and 13 fours, and the hands of the fielders were left bruised and burning. \"There was a drive off Vievers which sent the ball soaring over the sightboard\".pp19-24, Moyes and Goodman John Woodcock  of The Times wrote \"I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely to forget it. Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards.\"John Woodcock, The Times, 10 November 1962 After his departure Colin Cowdrey began to caressed the ball through the covers for 88, Ken Barrington a highly efficient 122 not out, Fred Titmus 37 and Barry Knight hit the 57 not like a good all rounder and the MCC make 458/5 in a day. Dexter carried on the innings for most of the next day, seeing Barrington make his first first-class double century (219 not out) and Knight 108, adding 209 for the sixth-wicket. He finally declared 40 minutes for tea for 633/7, had he waited any longer tea would have been taken early, but lost the advantage due to rain. It was the highest score by the MCC or England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the highest by the MCC since Douglas Jardine and company racked up 634/9 against South Australia back in 1932-33. The best bowler was Bobby Simpson who took 3/153 and now made 130 in response, adding 72 for the first-wicket with Thomas (27), 100 for the second with Harvey (51) and 67 for the third with Shepherd (114). Shepherd and McLachlan (55) added another 115 for the fourth-wicket, but David Larter (3/80) took three quick wickets and the Australian XI fell from 415/5 to 451 all out on the fourth and final day. Dexter was 182 runs ahead and could have enforced the follow on, but decided to give his bowlers a rest and batted again, but not very well. Colin Guest took 3/22 in some compensence for his first innings hammering and Dexter declared on 68/5, leaving the Australians 160 minutes to make 251 runs to win. They reached 201/4 thanks mainly to 91 not out from Shepherd and 68 from McLachlan. Dexter had used negative field placings throughout the match, which rather killed the sporting declaration, and the game died on its feet.p. 121, Swanton", "After rain delayed the start until 3 o'clock Ken Mackay won the toss and batted regardless of the convention that rain livens up the pitch at Brisbane, but Fred Trueman had backache and Brian Statham was being rested and the MCC bowling attack lacked bite. David Larter sent the ball flying over the batsmen's heads, but he scatter the ball all over the place. Len Coldwell dug the ball in as well and had a good slower ball, but failed to get the ball to swing. Peter Parfitt removed Des Ball with a diving catch at 10/1, but the rest of the day saw la number of missed chances and Queensland reached 123/2 by the end of the day. Sam Trimble crawled to 95 in six hours, a dismal innings which Johnny Moyes thought \"lacked so much in batsmanship that it did not deserve to go down in the records\".p36, Moyes and Goodman Nevertheless, with Tom Veivers (36), Peter Burge (34) and Graham Bizzell (59) he took the score to 259/5. Even \"Slasher\" Mackay looked good after this and the dour Queenslander started driving the ball through the covers, adding 85 with Des Hughson (26) and 88 with wicket-keeper Wally Grout who hit a swashbuckling 56 with 2 sixes and 6 fours. Mackay made 105 not out, the first century for Queensland vs the MCC since 1950-51 and their 433/7 declared was their highest score against them since the war. Geoff Pullar had the flu and Colin Cowdrey was also resting, so Peter Parfitt opened with David Sheppard saw the tourists through to stumps then took their stand to 101 the next day. Queensland's overseas player was the West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall and earlier on the Monday one of his bouncers rose awkwardly and broke Grout's jaw, he was hurried to hospital and missed the First Test as a result. Hall (0/106) was overbowled on the now flat Woolloongabba wicket and Queensland's best bowler was the leg-spinner Colin Westaway (3/156), which pretty much sums up the innings as the MCC piled up 581/6. Peter Parfitt made a subdued 47 and David Sheppard was dropped on 51, 77 and 83 before Mackay bowled him for 94. Ted Dexter powered his way to 80 in 85 minutes with a 6 and 13 fours, adding 110 with Sheppard. The insatiable Ken Barrington amassed 183 not out with 22 boundaries, including some superb drives, pulls and cuts, adding 103 with Tom Graveney (52) and 180 with the all rounder Barry Knight, who hit 2 sixes and 11 fours in his 81. Alan Smith came in at 512/6, but when he reached 22 he ducked into a Wes Hall bouncer that stayed low and became the second wicket-keeping casualty of the match. The Duke of Norfolk and the team physiotherapist Sam Cowan helped him off the field and took him to hospital, where to everyone's relief x-rays found that he had not fractured his skull. Dexter declared for 581/6 and John Murray came on as a substitute keeper. Queensland only had to bat out the afternoon, but Mackay re-arranged the batting order and they promptly collapsed to Dexter's medium-paced swing (4/8) and the part-time leg-spin of Tom Graveney (2/2). Mackay came in for the penultimate ball with the score on at 94/7 and was missed in the slips. With Grout unable to bat had Mackay been out the MCC would have needed to take Westaway's wicket with the last ball of the match for a surprise win in an otherwise dull game.pp. 35-39, Moyes and Goodmanp. 122, Swanton", "Usually the First Test took place after the Queensland game, but the MCC travelled out to Toowoomba for another minor game. Renald Sippel won the toss and batted, John Brown of the Queensland Colts was run out by a bullet-like left-hand throw from Fred Trueman. Ian Oxenford (66) added 64 for the second-wicket with the pedestrian Wilfred Brown, who took 80 minutes to make 8 runs before lunch. After lunch he made 48 runs in 73 minutes adding another 82 runs Sid Downes (43) before he \"retired out\". The innings was declared on 202/4, a total which the MCC passed thanks to Peter Parfitt, who hit a striking 145 with 4 sixes and 18 fours, one of the sixes hit a car and another interfered with a nearby croquet match. The target was passed with three wickets down, but the MCC continued to 325/8 in 160 minutes, allowing Don Bickel's off-spin to pick up the wickets of Colin Cowdrey, Fred Titmus, Barry Knight and John Murray for 91 runs.p41, Moyes and Goodman", "Returning to the first-class game the MCC played Victoria and their old nemesis Ian Meckiff, a \"chucker\" who had caused such ill-temper in 1958-59, but was not chosen for this series. His career was ended in 1963-64 when he was repeatedly no balled by Umpire Colin Egar against South Africa. Colin Cowdrey was still in charge and after winning the toss he put Victoria in to bat in the hope that there would be some early life in the Melbourne wicket. Victorian was a weak team in this period and their innings relied heavily on a long, tedious 177 by the 25-year-old captain Bill Lawry who added 85 with Jack potter (44) and 158 with Neville West (70). They staggered to 259/3 by the end of the day and collapsed to 340 all out the next morning, the last seven wickets falling for 72 runs. Brian Statham took 4/112, bowling steadily without any fire and Allen bowled 8 maidens to Lawry in his 3/57. Alan Connolly took 3/71 in reply, removing Peter Parfitt and David Sheppard to have the MCC 26/2. The Reverend walked after being given not out by the umpire, having given a feather-like edge to the keeper Ray Jordon. Cowdrey (46) and Tom Graveney (40) restored the situation with a stand of 81, but Cowdrey was run out and Keith Kirby (3/137) removed Graveney and Barry Knight. The depth of the MCC batting line-up was proven by Ray Illingworth (50), Geoff Pullar (91), batting with a runner after pulling a leg-muscle in the field and Alan Smith (41) before they were all dismissed by Meckiff (3/51). Statham hit a merry 26 and the MCC finished with 336, 4 runs behind Victoria. At the end of the third day Victoria were 135/5 and crashed to 175 all out the next day, Len Coldwell finding the cold weather and heavy atmosphere to his liking and taking 6/49 with his swing bowling. The MCC needed 180 to win and reached there target with five wickets in hand, Colin Guest took 3/32 and removing Pullar (2), Sheppard (50) and Cowdrey (63). It was a dull game and poorly attended, Johnny Moyes noting that Victorian are willing to pay to see good cricket, but the main draw Ted Dexter wasn't playing and this wasn't good cricket.pp. 64-69, Moyes and Goodman", "Tasmania would not play in the Sheffield Shield until 1976-77 and were much weaker than the other states, so some Test players were sent out to reinforce them and entertain the islanders; the batsmen Bill Lawry, Brian Booth, Norm O'Neill, Barry Shepherd and the wicketkeeper Len Maddocks, who had moved to Tasmania that season, captained the Combined XI. Ted Dexter won the toss and batted on a greenish wicket, the MCC making a brisk 331/7 before he declared just under an hour before stumps. The in-form David Sheppard made 82, Ken Barrington 73, Barry Knight 68 and Ray Illingworth 68. Knight hit 10 fours and a mighty six that left the ground, but the main talking point was the chucking action of the Tasmanian bowlers Keith Aldridge (1/63) and Gary Brakey (2/67), who were rounded condemned by the English pressmen. Bill Lawry and Gerry Connor survived the end of the first day, but there was a fearful collapse in the morning. \"Fiery Fred\" Trueman took 4/13 and the 6'7\" David Larter 4/24 as the Combined XI crashed to 77 all out. Dexter declined to enforce the follow-on and David Sheppard made 67, to give him 113, 82 and 67 on successive days. Rain stopped play until two-thirty on the last day and Dexter declared on his overnight score of 116/1. The outfield was wet so Trueman was not risked and the spinners; David Allen (4/19) and Ray Illingworth (3/11) routed the Combined XI for 57 for a 313 run win. The four Australian Test batsman were all out, twice, for 55 runs.pp. 95-97, Moyes and Goodman", "Sadly Johnny Moyes died suddenly on the first day of the two day match and his book on the series was completed by Tom Goodman of the Sydney Morning Herald. Due to the exciting Third Test a large crowd came to Newcastle, New South Wales to watch Northern New South Wales, with players from Newcastle, Canberra and Wollongong making up the side. The morning was lost to rain, the local captain won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and got them 180/6, despite Geoff Pullar making 53, but Barry Knight (73) and Alan Smith (45) adding 103 for the seventh-wicket and the MCC finished on 319. Douglas Dives (73) and Rodney Harvey (37) and Ken King (32) made most of the runs in the reply as Northern NSW were out for 203, Len Coldwell took 3/32 and David Allen 3/35. Batting again Dexter made 71 not out and Tom Graveney 41 before the MCC innings was declared at 190/4, leaving the home team 301 to win. After Max Fox (31) and Boxsell (40) added 68 for the first wicket they collapsed to 128/9 as Allen (5/38), Graveney (2/21) and Pullar (3/26) span them out. The crowd were determined to invade the ground on the point of victory, as they had seen in the Sydney Test, but last man Gilmour held everybody up by throwing his bat around for 29 in a last wicket stand of 33. When he was finally caught by Dexter off Geoff Pullar the enthusiastic crowd climbed the fences. Fred Trueman was bowled over and had his cap taken, but he soon recovered it and the teams ran off the field.pp. 114-116 Moyes and Goodman", "In 1958-59 the MCC had insisted on fewer upcountry matches, on this tour they were increased and as a result New South Wales lost its return match with the tourists, though Sydney did get two Tests. The Victoria Park Oval was a lovely ground, surrounded by bowling greens, croquet lawns, cricket and football fields, public parks and a zoo. The Country XI were overawed by Fred Trueman (4/45) in the first innings, with Len Coldwell taking 3/25 and David Allen 3/34 helping him dismiss them for 138. John Murray was wicket-keeping again after his injury in the Third Test and showed no ill effects. The MCC made 451/8 in return with David Sheppard (93) and captain Colin Cowdrey (97) added 151 before both getting out within minutes of stumps in the 98 degree heat. Graveney making the fastest century of the tour, 106 in 81 minutes and hit four sixes and Barry Knight hit a powerful 70. The Country XI survived the day to earn a draw even though Allen took 3/51, they made 227/5 thanks to the 24-year-old chemist Ian Drake. Drake was 'run out' on 59 when he hit the ball to the fence and Umpire Clare signalled a boundary, but Ray Illingworth picked it up a foot inside and threw it to Murray, who broke the wicket and Umpire Miller gave him out.

In his place, England chose a fast bowler to strengthen their bowling attack. While the game was taking place, Doug Insole, the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended.

The replacement for D'Oliveira, Barry Knight, performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81.
