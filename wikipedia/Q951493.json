Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune. As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel to Planet of the Apes, Dune was delayed for another year. Jacobs' first choice for director was David Lean, but he turned down the offer. Charles Jarrott was also considered to direct. Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued. Initially, the first treatment had been handled by Robert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequently Rospo Pallenberg was approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974.

The other directors were Selwyn Edge, Charles Jarrott, John Hewitt and Lord Willoughby. He called his machine the Ivel Agricultural Motor; the word \"tractor\" came into common use later after being created by Hart-Parr. The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, powerful and compact. It had one front wheel and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, utilizing thermo syphoning. It had one forward and one reverse gear. A belt pulley on the left hand side allowed it to be used as a stationary engine, driving a wide range of agricultural machinery. The 1903 sale price was \u00a3300. His tractor won a medal at the Royal Agricultural Show, in 1903 and 1904. About 500 were built, and many were exported all over the world. The original engine was made by Payne & Co. of Coventry. After 1906, French Aster engines were used."]}, {"page": "1982 in film", "response": ["| The Amateur || 20th Century Fox || Charles Jarrott (director); Robert Littell, Diana Maddox (screenplay); John Savage, Christopher Plummer, Marthe Keller, Arthur Hill, Nicholas Campbell, George Coe, John Marley, Ed Lauter || Crime, Thriller || Live action"]}, {"page": "1981 in film", "response": ["| Condorman || Walt Disney Productions / Buena Vista Distribution || Charles Jarrott (director); Mickey Rose, Marc Stirdivant (screenplay); Michael Crawford, Oliver Reed, Barbara Carrera, James Hampton, Jean-Pierre Kalfon, Dana Elcar, Vernon Dobtcheff, Robert Arden || Adventure, Comedy, Superhero || Live action"]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Last Flight of Noah's Ark || Walt Disney Productions / Buena Vista Distribution || Charles Jarrott (director); Steven W.

Like the play by Friedrich Schiller (Maria Stuart, 1800) and the opera by Gaetano Donizetti (Maria Stuarda, 1835), it takes considerable liberties with history in order to achieve increased dramatic effect, in particular two fictitious face-to-face encounters between the two queens (who never met in real life). The film received mixed reviews with criticism of the screenplay, running length and historical inaccuracies; however it received praise for the leading female performances, its production values, and musical score. At the 44th Academy Awards, the film received five nominations including Best Actress (for Redgrave).", "Vincent Canby had little good to write about the film in The New York Times, describing it as \"a loveless, passionless costume drama\". He wrote \"Unfortunately there is no excitement whatsoever in what Charles Jarrott, the director, and John Hale, the author of the original screenplay, have put together...Mary, Queen of Scots intends, I assume, to illuminate history...yet all it's really doing is touching bases, like a dull, dutiful student...Because both Miss Redgrave and Miss Jackson possess identifiable intelligence, [the film] is not as difficult to sit through as some bad movies I can think of.

This anthology series was networked nationally across the ITV regions on Sunday evenings, and in 1959 was in the top ten of the ratings for 32 out of the 37 weeks it was broadcast, with audiences of over  viewers. Newman used the strand to present plays by writers such as Alun Owen, Harold Pinter and Clive Exton, also bringing over associates from Canada such as Charles Jarrott and Ted Kotcheff. Writing in 2000, the television historian John Caughie stated that \"Newman's insistence that the series would use only original material written for television made Armchair Theatre a decisive moment in the history of British television drama.\""]}]}}
