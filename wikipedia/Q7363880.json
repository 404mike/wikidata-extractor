Because of injuries, Carr was moved to outside right, a position he had never played, for the replay, but according to the Manchester Guardian, \"he had his share of that inspiration that lifted the whole team high above its normal form\". The score after 90 minutes was 1\u20131. In the first nine minutes of extra time, Darlington scored three times to take the match 4\u20131.
