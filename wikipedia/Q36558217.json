The Society through its four committees provided art, music, books and open spaces to the working class poor, around the slogan \"Bring Beauty Home to the Poor\". This involved, at first, artistic decoration of hospitals, schools, literary institutes and working-class clubs. In 1876 her sister Octavia Hill became treasurer. There were numerous branches around the country, generally formed from around 1877 onwards, and one branch was supported by William Morris. The bryologist Frances Elizabeth Tripp was a donor to and supporter of the society. Another notable supporter was the Arts and Crafts architect Lady Mary Lovelace. The Society's Open Space Committee was influential in saving numerous stretches of heathland and woodland in London, that would otherwise have been built on, notably in 1890 the opening of Vauxhall Park. Many old burial grounds became public green spaces that are now highly prized leisure areas for Londoners.  After 1885, a representative of  the Society  sat on the first Council of the National Trust."]}, {"page": "Altarnun", "response": ["British bryologist Frances Elizabeth Tripp grew up in Altarnun, since her father was vicar."]}, {"page": "St Sidwells", "response": ["*British bryologist Frances Elizabeth Tripp was baptised here."]}, {"page": "Bryology", "response": ["* Frances Elizabeth Tripp (1832-1890)"]}, {"page": "Botanical illustration", "response": ["*Frances Elizabeth Tripp"]}, {"page": "Tripp (surname)", "response": ["* Frances Elizabeth Tripp, British botanist"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Fawcett", "response": ["Fawcett colourised the etched copper plates which were created by bryologist Frances Elizabeth Tripp to accompany her two-volume guide British Mosses."]}, {"page": "Fanny Tripp", "response": ["#redirectFrances Elizabeth Tripp"]}, {"page": "Frances E.
