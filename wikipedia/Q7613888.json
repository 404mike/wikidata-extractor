He signed a two-year contract on \u00a3225 a week. He scored on his debut against Aldershot at the Recreation Ground, despite missing a penalty; he replaced Steve Senior in the second half, who had broken his leg. The \"Minstermen\" went on to win the Fourth Division championship by a 16-point margin, with Houchen featuring mostly as a substitute in the final seven games. With John Byrne and Keith Walwyn forming an effective striking partnership, Houchen played as an attacking midfielder. He hit a hat-trick in a 7\u20131 thrashing of Gillingham at Bootham Crescent, and also converted a penalty that he had won to knock Arsenal out of the FA Cup at the Fourth Round. He scored a total of 18 goals in 45 appearances in 1984\u201385 to become the club's top scorer. However injuries helped to limit him to eight goals in 38 games in 1985\u201386, and he decided to accept a move back down to the Fourth Division."]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 York City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=row|Steve Senior"]}, {"page": "Senior, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve Senior"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| DF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Steve Senior", "| June 1987 || RB ||  || Steve Senior ||  York City ||", "| October 1987 || RB ||  || Steve Senior ||  Wigan Athletic ||"]}, {"page": "Stephen Senior", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steve Senior"]}]}}
