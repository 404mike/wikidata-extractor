When Wales were left short for the visit of Scotland in the 1925\u201326 Championship, Ted Robbins called up debutant Jack Lewis after following him to a train station in Newport where he was due to travel to Birmingham to play for Cardiff City. Defeats to Scotland and Ireland followed and Robbins was again forced to make a late addition for the final match against England: John Pullen had been travelling to London with Moses Russell and was persuaded to join up to win his first cap, alongside Charlie Jones. Wales went on to win the match 3\u20131. Wales recorded a third championship win of the decade during the 1927\u201328 tournament, despite starting the competition poorly: they conceded two goals in the first half against Scotland before Ernie Curtis and an own goal by Jimmy Gibson salvaged a point. Wales defeated England 2\u20131 before travelling to Belfast to play Ireland in the final match. The game was tied at 1\u20131 until Wilf Lewis secured the win for Wales by charging both the ball and opposition goalkeeper into the net. When Ireland defeated Scotland two weeks later, Wales were officially confirmed as winners."]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*Jimmy Gibson, 37 appearances"]}, {"page": "1932\u201333 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*Jimmy Gibson, 41 appearances"]}, {"page": "1933\u201334 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*Jimmy Gibson, 28 appearances"]}, {"page": "1934\u201335 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*Jimmy Gibson, 12 appearances"]}]}}
