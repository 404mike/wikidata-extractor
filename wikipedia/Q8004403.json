It could also be the genitive of hailing from the Isle of Bute--Bhoid in Gaelic.  The progenitor is said to have been Robert, son of Simon and nephew of Walter fitz Alan, the first High Steward of Scotland. This theory however is challenged by genealogist, William Anderson, who points out that most of the friends and dependents of the High Stewards were of Norman origin and it is therefore unlikely that they would use a Celtic nickname for one of their own family. Anderson believed the name to be of either Norman or Saxon origin.

On his return, while passing the castle of Moy the laird of Mackintosh sent a message to him demanding some of the spoil. Anderson goes on to say that this was customary among the Highlanders when a party drove cattle so taken through a gentleman's land, and the part so exacted was called a Staoig Ratliaid or Staoig Crtich that is, a road collop. Munro offered Mackintosh a reasonable share of the booty but Mackintosh would accept no less than half. This Munro refused and drove off the cattle. Shaw states that Mackintosh collected his clansmen and pursued Munro and came up with him at Glach-na-haire (Clachnaharry), near Inverness. Munro perceiving this approach sent fifty of his men home with the cattle and that in the ensuing contest, Mackintosh and the greater part of his men were killed. Several of the Munros were also killed and John Munro himself was left for dead on the field of battle. Lord Lovat had him carried to his house where he was cured of his wounds. One of his hands was so mutilated, that he lost the use of it, on which account he was afterwards culled John Bac-Lniinh, or Ciotach.

Glenorchy married Caithness's widow, the Countess Dowager, who was also a daughter of Campbell, Earl of Argyll who in turn was a relation of Campbell of Glenorchy. Glenorchy then assumed the title of Earl of Caithness. Although according to Anderson, Glenorchy took possession of the estates on Sinclair's death in May 1676, and was created Earl of Caithness in June the following year. Glenorchy appointed Sir John Sinclair of Murkle as sheriff and justicary-depute of Caithness, as well as bailie of all the baronies on the Caithness estate, in order to secure an influential friend in the county. George Sinclair of Keiss, son of Francis Sinclair of Northfield, disputed Glenorchy's right to the title and especially to the lands of Northfield and Tister, which he had inherited from his father.

The story goes that as the years passed and no male heir was born, that he saw two young ladies at a festival who far outshined the rest in beauty and accomplishment. He expressed admiration for them to his wife and the cruel fate which had caused to him to order the death of his two daughters, which had they lived would have been about the same age as the two beauties.
