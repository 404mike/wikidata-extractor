Originally fashioned by hammering plates of copper over a wooden base, these statues had been disassembled, placed inside one another and then sealed with a thin layer of engraved copper bearing the titles and names of Pepi\u00a0I \"on the first day of the Heb Sed\" feast. The two statues were symbolically \"trampling underfoot the Nine bows\"\u2014the enemies of Egypt\u2014a stylized representation of Egypt's conquered foreign subjects. While the identity of the larger adult figure as Pepi\u00a0I is revealed by the inscription, the identity of the smaller statue showing a younger person remains unresolved. The most common hypothesis among Egyptologists is that the young man shown is Merenre. As Alessandro Bongioanni and Maria Croce write: \"[Merenre] was publicly associated as his father's successor on the occasion of the Jubilee [the Heb Sed feast]. The placement of his copper effigy inside that of his father would therefore reflect the continuity of the royal succession and the passage of the royal sceptre from father to son before the death of the pharaoh could cause a dynastic split.\" Alternatively, Bongioanni and Croce have also proposed the smaller statue may represent \"a more youthful Pepy\u00a0I, reinvigorated by the celebration of the Jubilee ceremonies\"."]}, {"page": "Yuya", "response": ["Yuya and his wife were buried in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes, where their private KV46 tomb was discovered in 1905Cyril Aldred: Akhenaten, King of Egypt Thames and Hudson, 1989. p.96  by James Quibell, who was working on behalf of Theodore M.

This site was first scientifically excavated by James Quibell at the end of the nineteenth century, but other archaeologists have spent time at this site include Frederick William Green, Archibald Henry Sayce, Joseph John Tylor, and Somers Clarke.  However, Belgian archaeologists took over the project in 1937, and it has remained in their hands since then.   Much of the research done at this site took place within the town enclosure of El-Kab.  However, since the 1980s the work has shifted more to the north and north east of the town.Limme, Luc. \"Elkab, 1937\u20132007: Seventy Years of Belgian Archaeological Research.\" British Museum Studies in Ancient Egypt and Sudan (2008): 15-50.
