The series was written during the period 1965\u20131975. The Times called it \"one of the most important landmarks of post-war fiction.\" The story of The Raj Quartet begins in 1942. World War II is at its zenith, and in South East Asia, the Allied forces have suffered great losses. Burma has been captured by Japan, and the Japanese invasion of the Indian subcontinent from the east appears imminent.  The year 1942 is also marked by Indian nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi's call for the Quit India movement to the British colonial government. The Raj Quartet is set in this tumultuous background for the British soldiers and civilians stationed in India who have a duty to manage this part of the British Empire. One recurrent theme is the moral certainty of the older generation as contrasted with the anomie of the younger.For instance, in Day of the Scorpion, Sarah Layton envies the \"self-assurance\" of her older aunt. See Day of the Scorpion, Book Two Part Two ch. IV Another theme is the treatment of Indians by Britons living in India.For example, in Day of the Scorpion, Hari Kumar describes how a group of Anglo-Indians were shocked at the egalitarian attitude displayed by a recent English immigrant towards an Indian. See Day of the Scorpion Book Two Part One Ch. I As a reflection of these themes. the British characters let themselves be \"trapped by codes and principles, which were in part to keep their own fears and doubts at bay.\"review of Raj Quartet in  in The Spectator"]}]}}
