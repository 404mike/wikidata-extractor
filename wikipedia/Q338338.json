Day had been influenced by Eastern music, resulting in off-kilter guitar parts. Ryder and Whelan locked into grooves, with the encouragement of Weymouth. The majority of recording was plagued with a variety of issues with the band members.Middles 1997, p. 144 Happy Mondays discovered that the island was full of cheap crack available from local drug dealers, who knew the band were eager to purchase any drugs from them. Shaun Ryder ended up spending 20 hours each day in the toilet smoking crack, while the others were waiting to record.

While Shaun Ryder was doing vocals, the other members kept themselves occupied: Paul Ryder and Astrella Donovan followed the latter's father on tour; Whelan spent time at a gym; Day looked after his newly-born child; Davis moved house; and Bez tended to his broken arm. Trying to aid in the writing, Frantz and Weymouth would have Shaun Ryder do things such as dancing on the spot or consult the I Ching for lyrics.Middles 1997, p. 148 They also employed William S.

On the verge of receivership, Factory Records entered into a deal with London Recordings owner PolyGram, who would assume ownership of Factory.Middles 1997, pp. 151, 153 Since Factory was occupied, McGough managed to gain funds from the band's music publishing royalties, in the area of \u00a3250,000.
