During a return Manchester engagement, 20 July, the Pistols premiered a new song, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", reflecting elements of the radical ideologies to which Rotten was being exposed. According to Jon Savage, \"there seems little doubt that Lydon was fed material by Vivienne Westwood and Jamie Reid, which he then converted into his own lyric.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 204. \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" was among the seven originals recorded in another demo session that month, this one overseen by the band's sound engineer, Dave Goodman.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 118\u2013119; Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 205.

Meanwhile, the French pressing of Never Mind the Bollocks on Barclay had added \"Submission\" to the slated 11-song track list, and was due for release a week before Virgin's edition. As McLaren's separate deal with Barclay meant that the French release could not be halted and given the Virgin head was aware of how easy it was for import records to arrive in Britain, Branson rushed production of Never Mind the Bollocks to ensure it would come out a week earlier than intended. Nevertheless, the Barclay version was already available in the UK at the time Virgin had its version ready.

Desperate for a \"workaround\", McClaren discovered an October 1976 rehearsal session by the original lineup. In an effort to keep up their \"chops\", the band would rehearse during downtime at Wessex Studios while attempting to record the 'Anarchy In The UK' 7\" single for EMI with producer Dave Goodman in October 1976.

Unfortunately, the recording was raw and being a simple four-track recording, it was not suitable for commercial release.

McClaren suddenly had \"new\" Sex Pistols material suitable for release and performed exclusively by the original lineup. Better still, fans of the band had never heard these recordings.
