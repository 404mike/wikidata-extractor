Linked with the Bloomsbury set, his work, mostly in the classical style, was fashionable amongst the British upper classes and intelligentsia in the years immediately surrounding World War II. He is remembered today as a restorer of country houses and a designer of knowledgeable pastiches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerville College, Oxford", "response": ["Hostel is a small block between House and Darbishire completed in 1950 by Geddes Hyslop.

These pavilions, in reality rectangular but detached wings, had temple fronts complementing the two principal facades, and gave the side elevations of the mansion added grandeur and interest. This was achieved by the addition of a triumphal arch to an otherwise blank curtain wall. The pavilions are given unity with the mansion by high yew hedges acting as walls, which link the buildings, accentuating the Palladianism of the design.", "The interior of the mansion has been considerably altered and restored since its completion. The rooms are arranged in a circuit, although the principal room, the saloon, is flanked by slightly smaller rooms and adjoining cabinets. It is unlikely these smaller rooms were ever principal bedchambers, as would have been the case just a few years earlier in the 18th century.Girouard, p230. In fact, the layout was probably completely modern at the time; this is suggested by the siting of the dining room (3 on plan) and the drawing room (6 on plan). Geddes Hyslop's remodelling of the house in 1934 has created a series of seemingly meaningless and similar reception rooms, designed to accommodate large house parties. In some cases (including the Dutch Room) smaller rooms were amalgamated and lost. This has hidden the original uses of the rooms. During the late 18th century, rooms came to be perceived as masculine and feminine and arranged in suites accordingly. In particular the dining and drawing rooms \"reigned as king and queen over the other rooms\" and were often, as at Buscot, placed symmetrically in the house with a hall or saloon dividing them.Girouard, p233. The dividing room not only served to muffle the noise of boisterous men, partaking of their post-prandial port and cigars in the \"masculine\" dining rooms, from the more delicate ladies in the \"female\" drawing room, but also provided a \"little state and distance\" for the formal procession from the drawing room to the dining room.Girouard, p233.
