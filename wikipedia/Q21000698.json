Its founders, John Mason Neale, Alexander Hope, and Benjamin Webb, formed the society with the belief that by using Church reform in conjunction with piety of Gothic architecture, England could recapture the religious perfection of the Middle Ages. Their idealism is clear in one of the society's early letters: \"We know that [medieval] Catholick ethics gave rise to Catholick architecture; may we not hope that, by a kind of reversed process, association with Catholick architecture will give rise to Catholick ethics?\" The Ecclesiologists earnestly believed that medieval men were \"more spiritually-minded and less worldly-minded\" than were those of the modern world and that it was their duty to help return England to its former piety."]}, {"page": "1839 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Cambridge Camden Society established by John Mason Neale, Alexander Beresford Hope and Benjamin Webb to promote Gothic architecture."]}, {"page": "Alexander Beresford Hope", "response": ["While at Trinity College in 1839, he was, along with John Mason Neale and Benjamin Webb a founder of the Cambridge Camden Society (later the Ecclesiological Society).

It rapidly became popular: its membership increased from 8 to 180 in its first 12 months.Eastlake 1872, pp.\u00a0196\u20137. Although initially a society for recording and discussing medieval church features, the members of the CCS soon began to expostulate in their journal The Ecclesiologist and particularly in their Few Words to Church-builders of 1844 that the only \"correct\" form for a church building was the \"middle pointed\" or \"Decorated\" style,Clark 1962, p.170\u20131. in which churches had been built during the hundred years centred on 1300.

Its rector between 1719 and 1759, Charles Covert, did work on the chancel during his incumbency.  The antiquarian Sir William Burrell, 2nd Baronet, who visited most of Sussex's parish churches during the 18th century, recorded St Leodegar's Church as having a chancel and a nave with a south aisle.  It was pictured and described again 16 years later in The Gentleman's Magazine: there was a flat-arched entrance in the west wall and an older (apparently 12th-century) south door with Norman-style chevron moulding, a continuous roof over the nave and south aisle, a three-bay pointed-arched round-columned arcade separating the aisle and nave, and lancet windows throughout.  The church was said to be \"in so decayed a state that its utter ruin seems unavoidable before long\". Similar features were depicted in sketches by other artists in the 19th century, including one dated  1851 by Richard Henry Nibbs in which the nave and chancel were clearly in ruinous condition. His accompanying notes bore this out. A survey of Sussex churches by John Mason Neale and Benjamin Webb in 1841 noted that there were wall murals inside in the form of painted Biblical verses."]}, {"page": "William Cooke (priest, born 1821)", "response": ["*The Hymnary, ed., with Rev.
