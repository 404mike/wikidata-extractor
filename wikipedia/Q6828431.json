Quirk and Fort note that the concerns of journeymen players and superstars, with respect to contract and other negotiations, differ: Superstars are concerned with the preservation of their rights to be free agents, whilst journeymen players are concerned with issues such as league minimum salaries and player pensions. Fort observes that this leads to conflicts between journeymen and superstars, such as (Fort's example) the 1995 attempt by a group of superstar players to derail the agreement between the NBA and its players' association. Holt and Mason note that in football, golf, flat racing, snooker, cricket, and other sports there is a clear distinction in earnings between the few rich stars in each sport and the journeyman professionals. They state that snooker has \"an \u00e9lite of perhaps twenty players\" and point to a distinction between high earning test cricketers with six figure wages and \"the average county professional\" (for whom they give Simon Hughes, who earned \u00a350,000 in the whole of his twelve years in county cricket, as an example).
