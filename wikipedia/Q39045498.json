In 2014 the NUS Conference voted in support of free education, reversing the union's previous policy of advocating a graduate tax as a replacement for tuition fees, which it had adopted in the late 2000s. The Student Broad Left made progressive gains in the mid-2010s, culminating in the election of SBL candidate Malia Bouattia as NUS President. Participants in the protests went on to be involved in a number of left-wing causes, such as the trade union movement, the climate movement, Palestinian and Kurdish solidarity, alternative media (such as Aaron Bastani, co-founder of Novara Media), migrant and refugee solidarity campaigns, and Momentum and the Labour Party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn (such as James Schneider, who served as Corbyn's head of strategic communications)."]}, {"page": "List of Trinity College, Oxford people", "response": ["* James Schneider"]}, {"page": "Momentum (organisation)", "response": ["Momentum is a British left-wing political organisation which has been described as a grassroots movement supportive of the Labour Party; since January 2017, all Momentum members must be (or become) members of the party. It was founded in 2015 by Jon Lansman, Adam Klug, Emma Rees and James Schneider after Jeremy Corbyn's successful campaign to become Labour Party leader and it is reported to have between 20,000 and 30,000 members in 2021.", "Momentum was founded in 2015 by Jon Lansman and fellow national organisers Adam Klug, Emma Rees and James Schneider, four weeks after Jeremy Corbyn's successful campaign for the Labour Party leadership. Local groups formed to support Corbyn's leadership, uniting several factions of the left across Britain. Lansman was active in Tony Benn's 1981 deputy leadership bid and, after volunteering for Corbyn's leadership bid, had become the director of Jeremy Corbyn Campaign 2015 (Supporters) Ltd, which held the data collected during the campaign. In addition to their support of Corbyn, Momentum has three primary goals: to win elections for Labour, to create a socialist Labour government, and to help build a broader social movement. Corbyn was positive about Momentum after it was formed, saying in 2016: \"I see Momentum as a social movement. A movement that will campaign on all of these issues. But above all, excite and unite people to come together, to come together to challenge injustice, inequality and social exclusion. Bring people together to achieve things together. That is what is makes us [Labour] so different from every other political party in this country.\"", "Momentum and a number of political commentators characterise their supposed relationship with other groups as unfair, and in October 2015 the organisation said that it would resist such entryism. Author and journalist Michael Crick criticises the comparison to Militant, saying that \"the rise of Jeremy Corbyn can be attributed more to the phenomenon of 'Corbynmania' than to hard-left entrism\". (back cover) Former Labour MP Peter Kilfoyle, the Merseyside Labour-leadership enforcer against Militant during the 1980s as the party's north-west regional organiser, also rejected the comparison and describing Momentum as filling the role on the left of the party as Progress did on the right. In December 2015, Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said on the Today programme: \"They look like a bit of a rabble to me, but I don't think they are a problem for the Labour Party\". James Schneider said in response to the accusation, \"The purpose of Momentum is not to have internal factional battles, it's to look outside\"."]}, {"page": "Schneider, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Schneider"]}]}}
