David Theobald cleared off the line to deny David Lee a goal in the first half. Dobson then fired Brentford ahead on the 56th-minute, only for a header from Spencer Whelan to bring the game level just a minute later. Dobson struck the net with a shot deflected off the post on 64 minutes and the game ended with Brentford ahead two goals to one. The return fixture took place at Griffin Park a week later. \u00cdvar Ingimarsson gave Brentford an early lead on 13 minutes, but Searle equalised when his free-kick went in off Theobald. Brentford goalkeeper \u00d3lafur Gottsk\u00e1lksson left the game injured early in the second half, though young goalkeeper Paul Smith performed excellently in Gottsk\u00e1lksson's absence, denying Scott Forbes and blocking another strike with his legs. Owusu secured the win with a goal on the 78th-minute, assisted by Paul Gibbs. Darren Powell was sent off after receiving two yellow cards late on, but Brentford managed to hold on to their 2\u20131 lead on the night to win the tie 4\u20132 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "David Lee (footballer born 1980)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Lee (footballer, born 1980)"]}]}}
