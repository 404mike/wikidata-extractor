Cricket commentator Colin Bateman stated, \"Bolus was essentially an accumulator, dependably totting up 25,000 runs over 20 summers\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Ronnie Burnet was Yorkshire's new captain in 1958. Not an accomplished player, though he had previously captained the club's Second XI, he was a good man-manager and a firm disciplinarian who could get the best out of what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons.Arlott, pp. 98\u201399. The other \"trouble-maker\", Appleyard, lost his ability as a result of his illnesses and Yorkshire dropped him for good mid-season. Although the team could only finish 11th in the County Championship, having lost 24 full days to the weather, it was a much happier dressing room than it had been since 1946. Regular team members now included Binks, Brian Bolus, Burnet, Close, Cowan, Trueman, Illingworth, Lowson, Padgett, David Pickles, Phil Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman, Don Wilson and Vic Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was really beginning to take shape.Arlott, p. 99."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Brian Bolus"]}, {"page": "Bolus", "response": ["* Brian Bolus (born 1934), former English cricketer who played in 7 Tests from 1963"]}, {"page": "Wes Hall", "response": ["Perhaps Hall's greatest performance of the English summer was in the second Test at Lord's. On the final day of the Test, Hall bowled unchanged for 200 minutes, broken only by the tea interval. As in the Tied Test in Brisbane three years earlier, Hall found himself bowling the final over of the match with both sides still capable of winning. In the innings as a whole Hall bowled 40 overs for a return of 4/93 but despite Hall's brave efforts, England managed to hold on for a draw\u2014the England batsman Colin Cowdrey returned to the crease with a broken arm to help save the match. The Times said of Hall that day, \"His energy was astonishing, his stamina inexhaustible, his speed awesome, from the first ball to the last\". Hall himself claimed that it was his \"finest hour\".Smith, p. 124. There was a sour note in the final Test at The Oval when Hall was informally warned about intimidatory bowling. Hall bowled two successive bouncers to the England opening batsman Brian Bolus, prompting umpire Syd Buller to speak with West Indies captain Worrell saying, \"We don't want this sort of bowling to get out of hand otherwise I will have to speak to the bowler.\" Later than innings, Griffith was formally warned by the same umpire."]}, {"page": "Bapu Nadkarni", "response": ["Nadkarni was perhaps best known for his bowling in the Madras Test against England in 1963-64. His figures at the end of third day of the match, bowling mostly against Brian Bolus and Ken Barrington, read 29 overs, 26 maidens, and no wickets for three runs. He finished with figures of 32-27-5-0 and bowled a record twenty one consecutive maiden overs (131 dot balls in a row) in a 114-minute bowling spell.  In the final Test of that series, Nadkarni hit 52* and 122*. It remained his only hundred in Test cricket."]}, {"page": "Geoff Millman", "response": ["Millman was also a useful right-handed batsman, scoring 1,000 runs in two seasons. In a county side where there were frequent personnel changes, he batted in most positions, often opening the innings. From 1963 to 1965 he was county captain, and in his first year, with the side buoyed by the newly acquired Brian Bolus, Nottinghamshire finished ninth. Two years later, though, they were back at the bottom and Millman resigned the captaincy and left first-class cricket, returning to Bedfordshire and his business interests."]}, {"page": "Alan Ward (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1973, he refused to bowl in a County Championship game against Yorkshire, and Derbyshire's captain, Brian Bolus, banished him from the field.The sending-off of an England quick, Cricinfo, 2 July 2005 In 1976, he left the county in unhappy circumstances, but was called up to play against the West Indies in the fifth, and final, Test Match of his career.
