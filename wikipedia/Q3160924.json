Although Varney laid on Derby's goal for Tomasz Cwyka, the club fell to a second consecutive defeat as Cardiff ran out 2\u20131 winners. Despite being the sole forward fully fit and available, Varney was left out of the trip to Coventry City, to prevent a risk of injury ahead of a proposed loan move to an unidentified club.

With midfielder James Bailey injured in the week prior to the match, an ankle injury which ruled him out for three months. Derby unsuccessfully tried to sign former-Captain Matt Oakley on loan from Leicester City to bolster the midfield. The already contentious fixture saw tensions heightened by the news that Nathan Tyson, who had injured himself in pre-season following his move to Derby from Forest, was finally available for selection for the Rams. In the event of the match, Frank Fielding was sent off after just 66 seconds after bundling over Forest striker Ishmael Miller giving Adam Legzdins to make his first appearance for the club, with his first action being to pick Andy Reid's penalty out of the back of the net. However, Jamie Ward's 29th-minute equaliser, a mazy run past three Forest defenders before he beat Lee Camp at his near post from the byline, saw the ten-man Derby side level at half-time.

The draw came despite the absence of John Brayford, who missed his first match since joining Derby 15 months previously after picking up an injury in training, and top-scorer Steve Davies' early exit after picking up an eye injury.
