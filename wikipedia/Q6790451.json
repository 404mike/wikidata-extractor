This meant that Hankey automatically received a tour card to play in the PDC and its Pro Tour, rather than  having to play through the qualifying school tournament (usually a requirement to all new PDC players). His first event on the tour was the opening Players Championship of 2012, The Spanish Darts Trophy, where he lost 4\u20136 to Matthew Edgar in the preliminary round. Hankey then won his first matches in the PDC by defeating Steve West 6\u20135 and Toon Greebe 6\u20131 in the first UK Open qualifier in Crawley, before losing 6\u20134 to Connie Finnan. In May, Hankey had his best finish on the tour to date, reaching the last 16 of the Players Championship Event 5, losing 1\u20136 to Raymond van Barneveld. In his first major event on the tour, the UK Open, Hankey beat qualifier Danny Dutson 4\u20130 and Andy Jenkins 4\u20131, but then lost to his old BDO rival Mervyn King 1\u20134 in the second round."]}, {"page": "Kevin Painter", "response": ["Painter lives in Rugby, Warwickshire.
