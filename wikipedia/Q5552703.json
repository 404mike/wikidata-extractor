But a terrible start to the 1995\u201396 season saw City endure eight defeats and not win one of their opening 11 games.

He played against Leicester City on 10 February, but his knee collapsed and the resulting cruciate ligament damage ended his career. He became assistant first-team coach at the club upon his retirement. He had a testimonial game at Fratton Park in May 1998. He was a popular figure at the club, and in February 2005 he came second in the Football Focus poll to find the club's \"cult hero\", behind teammate Alan Knight."]}, {"page": "Lou Macari", "response": ["In October 1993, Macari left Stoke City and returned to Scotland to manage Celtic.  Despite defeating Rangers 2\u20131 at Ibrox in his first match, his time at Celtic Park was unsuccessful. Macari made several moves in the transfer market - none of them particularly successful. Gerry Creaney, one of the few consistent goalscorers at Celtic at that time, was played out of position on the right-wing for several weeks before being sold to Portsmouth for \u00a3600,000. Striker Willie Falconer was signed from Sheffield United, right-back Lee Martin and goalkeeper Carl Muggleton came north from England, and in what is considered one of Macari's poorest moves, Andy Payton moved to Barnsley in a part-exchange deal for journeyman striker Wayne Biggins. A miserable 4\u20132 defeat by Rangers in the New Year fixture at Parkhead left Celtic languishing in the league.

Cassidy had an impressive background but his abrasive nature did not go down well in Scottish football.  On the pitch, Celtic gained a modicum of revenge over Rangers for their earlier Skol Cup Final defeat in a 1991 Scottish Cup quarter-final tie with their rivals, beating them 2\u20130 through Gerry Creaney and Dariusz Wdowczyk goals. It was a wild St. Patrick's Day encounter which saw three Rangers players (Terry Hurlock, Mark Walters and Mark Hateley) and one Celtic player (Peter Grant) get the red card.

The situation was exacerbated in late October when Kinkladze crashed his Ferrari, sustaining a back injury that required 30 stitches and caused him to miss two matches. By November City lay in the relegation zone with just 3 wins from 16 matches. A home defeat to Huddersfield Town led to open rebellion amongst the club's supporters. On the tenth anniversary of a match in which the same opposition were beaten 10\u20131, Manchester City succumbed to a defeat that was last-placed club Huddersfield's first away win of the season.

The season hit a new low with 3\u20131 away defeat to local rivals Stockport County who were having the best season in their history.
