I loved the Bar too much\". After the death of the High Court judge Sir Anthony Hawke in October 1941, the Lord Chancellor Lord Simon offered Birkett the seat.Hyde (1965) p. 474. Birkett considered it his \"public duty\" to join the bench and wrote back on 4 November accepting the offer. He was sworn in on 11 November 1941 and first sat on 24 November.Hyde (1965) p. 476. He did not enjoy his time in the high courts, admitting that he \"missed the limelight\" of being an advocate, and, combined with ill-health, he suffered from depression in 1942. He was, however, a popular judge, although he felt he was too weak in his judgments because he \"did not desire to hurt people's feelings\". At one point, the Daily Herald reported he was to be made Viceroy of India.Hyde (1965) p. 483. For several weeks in 1943, he sat in the Court of Appeal before departing on an Assize visit. He fell ill after a few weeks with a combination of heart disease and pneumonia, and he returned home to recover.Hyde (1965) p. 484. He suffered from more illness over the next year and considered resigning as a judge, as he felt that he could no longer trust his abilities as one.Hyde (1965) p. 486. During his time in the High Court, he dealt with several notable cases including Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd, which reaffirmed the common law principle that innkeepers must not refuse accommodation to guests without just cause.[1944] KB 693; Hyde (1965) p. 489."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Anthony Hawke "]}, {"page": "St Ives (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| 1922 || Anthony Hawke || Conservative", "| 1924 || Anthony Hawke || Conservative", "*Unionist: Anthony Hawke"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|Anthony Hawke"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Anthony Hawke"]}, {"page": "1928 St Ives by-election", "response": ["The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Unionist Party Member of Parliament (MP) Anthony Hawke on his appointment to be a High Court judge."]}, {"page": "Clifford Cory", "response": ["In 1918 Cory stood and won in support of the Coalition government of David Lloyd George.

The evidence presented included \"a mass of incriminating documents and photographic material\". Glading pled guilty. His solicitors, instructed by the CPGB, were Denis Pritt, leading, and assisted by Dudley Collard. They\u2014at the CPGB's request\u2014advised him to change his plea to Not Guilty; this Glading did. But they presented little evidence in his favour and carried out only minimal cross-examination, and the defence was unable to question Gray's credibility due to her professional behaviour on the stand. The prosecution, on the other hand, consisted of some of the most well-known advocates of the day and was led by Donald Somervell. Pritt's defence of Whomack was more energetic, and he lambasted the Official Secrets Act for making it \"far too easy to be charged for misdemeanour merely by wandering too close to a dockyard\" or anywhere else such secret plans were kept.The trial judge, Sir Anthony Hawke, told the accused that Glading was \"endeavouring to do anything [he] could to help another country and injure this. This is [his] own country but I cannot quite believe that this had any effect on your mind\". The judge wondered whether, as perhaps evinced by Glading's prosperous existence, he might have profited financially from his work with Moscow and that he was motivated by money rather than ideology. Whatever his motive, the outcome was never in doubt. On 14 March 1938, Glading received a sentence of six years' imprisonment (hard labour). Williams was sentenced to four years, Whomack to three. Munday's charges were withdrawn by the prosecution. Duff argues it is possible that this was the result of his making a deal with MI5 to turn king's evidence and reveal the tradecraft of Glading's operation at the Royal Arsenal. Even the others, comments MI5's official historian, received \"light sentences by the later standards of espionage trials\". This may well have been quid pro quo for pleading guilty and avoiding the need for a full prosecution."]}, {"page": "Hawke, Anthony", "response": ["#redirectAnthony Hawke"]}]}}
