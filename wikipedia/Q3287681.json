His cross-disciplinary work in painting, drawing, collage, sculpture, installation, furniture, lighting, ceramics, textiles, and wallpaper challenges the categorical divisions between art and design.\nChaimowicz was born in 1947 in postwar Paris to a Polish Jewish father and French Catholic mother. The family moved to England when the artist was eight years old and settled in London, where he still lives and works. His first solo museum exhibition in the United States was held at the Jewish Museum in New York.Chaimowicz was shortlisted for the 2016 Turner Prize.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thea Westreich Wagner", "response": ["Charline von Heyl, Anne Collier, Liz Deschenes, Hito Steyerl, Marc-Camille Chaimowicz, Robert Gober, Bernadette Corporation, Jeff Koons, Sam Lewitt, Sol LeWitt, Cady Noland, Richard Prince, Rirkrit Tiravanija, David Wojnarowicz, Christopher Wool, Robert Adams, Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, Eileen Quinlan, and many others."]}]}}
