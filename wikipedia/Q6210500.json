His mother was the daughter of Sir Thomas Turton, former Advocate-General of Bengal.

In 1933, however, he joined the Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions as a Professional Legal Clerk. In 1946 he was appointed secretary of the Metropolitan Police Office, ranking with the Assistant Commissioners (although a civilian). In 1949 he spent three months in Malaya as a member of the Police Mission to advise the government on problems stemming from the Malayan Emergency.\nIn August 1953 he was appointed Assistant Commissioner \"C\", in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department.
