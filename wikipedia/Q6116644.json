The club dropped to 14th spot in 1913\u201314, and only avoided relegation on the last day of the 1914\u201315 season after bribing Liverpool to lose 2\u20130 at Old Trafford; Meredith this time played no part in the resulting bribery scandal.

They finished in second place behind Aston Villa in the 1909\u201310 season, the last for their captain, Raisbeck, who returned to his native Scotland to play for Partick Thistle. Liverpool's form declined after his departure, with their best performance in the League a 12th-place finish in the 1912\u201313 season. There was improvement in 1914 when the club reached their first FA Cup final, which they lost 1\u20130 to Burnley at Crystal Palace. The following season four Liverpool players were implicated in the 1915 British football betting scandal, which involved a match with Manchester United. A 2\u20130 victory for United was required to win the bet, in which players from both sides were involved. With the score at 2\u20130, Liverpool's Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar with a shot, at which several of his teammates gestured angrily towards him. Subsequently, Tom Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were found guilty by a Football Association (FA) enquiry of conspiring with three Manchester United players (Sandy Turnbull, Arthur Whalley and Enoch West) to fix a United win. All the players involved were banned for life. Following the end of the First World War, in which Turnbull was killed at the Battle of Arras in 1917, the FA lifted the surviving players' bans in recognition of their service in the conflict."]}, {"page": "Match fixing in English football", "response": ["After the match, handbills started to appear, alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2\u20130 win to United.
