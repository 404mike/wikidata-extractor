He joined the navy aged 25 years, seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the merchant navy where he traded until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, whereupon he returned to the Royal Navy and was commissioned.\nBenbow fought against France during the Nine Years War (1688\u201397), serving on and later commanding several English vessels and taking part in the battles of Beachy Head, Barfleur and La Hogue in 1690 and 1692. He went on to achieve fame during campaigns against Sal\u00e9 and Moor pirates; laying siege to Saint-Malo; and fighting in the West Indies against France during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714).\nBenbow's fame and success earned him both public notoriety and a promotion to admiral. He was then involved in an incident during the action of August 1702, where a number of his captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 10", "response": ["*1653 \u2013 John Benbow, Royal Navy admiral (d. 1702)"]}, {"page": "November 4", "response": ["*1702 \u2013 John Benbow, English admiral (b. 1653)"]}, {"page": "1653", "response": ["* March 10 \u2013 John Benbow, English Royal Navy Admiral (d. 1702)"]}, {"page": "1702", "response": ["* November 4 \u2013 John Benbow, English officer in the Royal Navy (b. 1653)"]}, {"page": "Shropshire", "response": ["* John Benbow, Admiral of the White, born Shrewsbury"]}, {"page": "Treasure Island", "response": ["* 1702: The Admiral Benbow Inn where Jim and his mother live is named after the real life Admiral John Benbow (1653\u20131702)."]}, {"page": "HMS Benbow (1913)", "response": ["HMS Benbow was the third of four s of the Royal Navy, the third ship to be named in honour of Admiral John Benbow.Lecky, p. 204 Ordered in the 1911 building programme, the ship was laid down at the William Beardmore and Company shipyard in May 1912, was launched in November 1913, and was completed in October 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.

Another was the provision of temporary shore-based hospitals, such as those briefly set up during the Anglo-Dutch Wars in such locations as Ipswich, Rochester, Harwich and Plymouth (the latter being established on a more permanent footing in 1689).
