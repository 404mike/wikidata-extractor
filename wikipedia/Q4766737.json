However, as early as 1901, Wilbur Wright wrote about thermals, \"when gliding operators have attained greater skill, they can, with comparative safety, maintain themselves in the air for hours at a time in this way, and thus by constant practice so increase their knowledge and skill that they can rise into the higher air and search out the currents which enable the soaring birds to transport themselves to any desired point, by first rising in a circle, and then sailing off at a descending angle.\""]}, {"page": "F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale", "response": ["** The Ann Welch Diploma"]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*5 December \u2013 Ann Welch, glider pilot (born 1917)"]}, {"page": "Welch (surname)", "response": ["*Ann Welch (1917\u20132002), English pilot"]}, {"page": "List of glider pilots", "response": ["* Ann Welch - instructor and administrator"]}, {"page": "Look at Life (film series)", "response": ["| November 1959 || Sailing the Sky || Tim Turner || The grace and freedom of gliding and an interview with Britain's leading woman glider pilot, Ann Welch.

It operated at Odiham Airfield but after two accidents, the Commandant of Sandhurst ordered it to suspend operations. In early 1951 he ordered Major Deane-Drummond to restart the club at Lasham. In the meantime, the Surrey Gliding Club and Imperial College Gliding Club were both seeking a new home, because Redhill Aerodrome had many other users. The Surrey club and Imperial College therefore moved to Lasham in August 1951. As well as Tony Deane-Drummond, other notable instructors at that time included Ann Welch, Lorne Welch and Philip Wills. All of them went on to become British champions. A war-surplus barrage balloon winch was used for launches. Types flown included Slingsby T.21B trainer, Grunau Baby, and various other pre-war German sailplanes.", "Derek Piggott was Chief Flying Instructor at Lasham during much of the period from 1953 to 1989.

Stephenson", "response": ["He started gliding at the London Gliding Club in 1935. Three years later, on the 22 April 1939, he was the first glider pilot to soar across the English Channel in a Slingsby Gull after having taken off from Dunstable starting at 14:55 with a very low winch launch (300 feet). The location and altitude of his starting point meant that he had to soar over a long distance to gain enough height to make the crossing. Previous crossings had relied on very high tows near the south coast. He crossed the French coast at 2,600 ft and landed in a small field by the village of Le Wast, 10 miles East of Boulogne, at 1735 hours, flying 204km in 2hr 40min. Ann Welch and Donald Greig retrieved him by car and ferry."]}]}}
