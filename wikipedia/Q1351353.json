(1971). Beobachtungen zur Jugendentwicklung einigen Eulcn (Strigidae). Z. Tierpsychol. 28: 494\u2013504. Despite the tawny owl\u2019s reputation as a highly aggressive bird when encroached upon, the parents are usually retiring even when the area of the nest is broached. Passive measures are usually taken first in parental nest defense. The mother owls are often tight sitters, one female sat motionless even as she was physically turned over, while another sat tight but flushed eventually after several human intrusions.Cassidy, J. (1946). Tawny Owl nesting in factory wall. British Birds, 39: 155.Labitte, A (1952). Oiseaux, 22: 107\u201312. Sometimes parents engage in distraction display when attempting to protect their young but less frequently than do long-eared owls. There is much individual variation in aggressiveness of response to disturbance and threats, with a similar occasional but widely reported tendencies for aggressiveness in nest defense in many other Strix owls as well. In the earlier part of the nestling period, males sometimes launch defensive attacks but these tend to be relatively mild and no physical contact is often made. In western Switzerland, females were 2.9 times more likely to respond aggressively to artificial nest predator stimuli than males.Da Silva, A., Van den Brink, V., Emaresi, G., Luzio, E., Bize, P., Dreiss, A. N., & Roulin, A. (2013). Melanin-based colour polymorphism signals aggressive personality in nest and territory defence in the tawny owl (Strix aluco). Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 67(7), 1041\u20131052. Later into the nesting period, the female may begin showing more aggressive reactions to disturbance or threats. Older females were found in a study show a more aggressive defense as well as those with larger broods and earlier nestings, however non-aggressive females were found to have more future reproductive years on average than aggressive ones.Wallin, K. (1987). Defence as parental care in tawny owls (Strix aluco). Behaviour, 102(3\u20134), 213\u2013230. Rufous morph females were more vigorous in nest defense than other morphs in a study from Switzerland. At the first detection of an intruder, the female may let out muffled hoots initially.Delm\u00e9e, E., Dachy, P., & Simon, P. (1978). Fifteen years of observations on the reproductions of a forest population of a Tawny Owls (Strix aluco). Gerfaut, 68(4), 590\u2013650. Attacks only tend to occur somewhat regularly in developed areas, especially city parks, where repeated intrusions occur and perhaps resulting desensitization and irritation.Southern, H.N. (1970). The Natural Control of a Population of Tawny Owl (Strix aluco). The Journal of Zoology, 162: 197\u2013285. Some individual females and rarely males become routine attackers on humans and may be known as \u201cfuries\u201d.Dobbs, A. (1966). Aggressive Tawny Owls. British Birds, 59: 108\u2013109. In at least some cases parks may be closed due to unprovoked tawny owl attacks.Steinbach, G. (1980). Die Welt der Eulen. Verlag Hoffmann & Campe. Hamburg. The female tends to attack humans from behind and focus on the head and shoulders when physical contact is made, especially if the person turns their back, but even then often veer short of physical contact. Humans are inefficient at fending off sudden physical attacks because of the silent flight of the owls.Andersen T. (1961). En nordsjaellansk Natugle-bestand (Strix aluco L.) i yngletiden. [A population of tawny owl (Strix aluco) in Northern Zealand, studied in the breeding season]. Dansk Or- nithologisk Forenings Tidsskrift, 55: 1\u20135.Hosking, E. J., Newberry, C. W., & Smith, S. G. (1945). Birds of the Night. Collins.Boswall, J. (1965). An unusually aggressive Tawny Owl. British Birds, 58: 343\u2013344.Cadman, W.A. (1934). An attacking Tawny Owl. British Birds, 28: 130\u2013132. Tawny owl mothers not infrequently attack threatening animals common in parks such as dogs and cats as well as martens (at times knocking them out of the trees) and red foxes, especially at dawn or early in the night.Szomjas, L. (1955). Tawny Owl attacking Marten. Aquila, 59: 450. Other than scalp abrasions, occular damage can be considerable when tawny owls attack humans. Perhaps the best-known victim of the tawny owl's fierce attack was the renowned bird photographer Eric Hosking, who lost his left eye when struck by a bird he was attempting to photograph near its nest in 1937. He later called his autobiography An Eye for a Bird."]}]}}
