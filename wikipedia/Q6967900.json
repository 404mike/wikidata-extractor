Before the cup final, Forrest (together with Rovers teammates Billy Townley, Joe Lofthouse, John Barton and Nat Walton) was selected for the England match against Ireland on 15 March 1890. Because of the crowded fixture list, England also played a match against Wales on the same day. The match against Ireland ended in a 9\u20131 victory for England, with a hat-trick from Fred Geary. This was Forrest's final appearance for England, in an international career which spanned seven seasons in which he played eleven times, with six victories, three draws and two defeats, both against Scotland.", "The cup final was played at the Kennington Oval on 29 March 1890 against The Wednesday who were the champions of the Football Alliance which had been set up to provide competition for clubs excluded from the Football League. Rovers put out a team of players most of whom were England or Scotland internationals, although Wednesday had England internationals Teddy Brayshaw and Billy Betts in their defence. From the kick-off, the Rovers forwards had the Wednesday defence under pressure which led to Jack Dungworth handling the ball on the edge of his goal area in the sixth minute. Forrest took the free kick which fell to Billy Townley whose shot took a deflection for the first goal. Further goals from Nat Walton and Townley gave Rovers a 3\u20130 lead at half-time. The second half continued with Rovers on top with Jack Southworth adding a fourth goal in the fiftieth minute before Albert Mumford was able to score for Wednesday. Further goals from Townley and Joe Lofthouse in the last 15 minutes gave a winning scoreline of 6\u20131 to Rovers. Townley had thus become the first player to score an FA cup final hat-trick. According to Gibbons, \"the Blackburn side had given one of the finest exhibitions of attacking football in an FA cup final, with England internationals Walton, Townley, Lofthouse and John Southworth at the peak of their form.\""]}, {"page": "Nat (name)", "response": ["* Nat Walton (1866\u20131930), English international footballer"]}, {"page": "Nathaniel Walton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nat Walton"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Nat Walton"]}]}}
