Her grasp of the social history of medieval England owes much to her older sister, the historian Eileen Power, who before her early death in 1940 had collaborated with Rhoda in preparing scripts for broadcasting on the BBC. Among these had been a story about life in a medieval village, told from the standpoint of Simon, a serf who had fled from a nearby manor. This story may have suggested the framework for Redcap Runs Away. However, English literary concern with minstrelsy has been continual since the Romantic period: poems such as Sir Walter Scott's The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and John Clare's The Village Minstrel (1821), and novels like Helen Craik's Henry of Northumberland (1800), Sydney Owenson's The Novice of St. Dominick (a girl flees disguised as a minstrel, 1805), and more recently, Christabel Rose Coleridge's Minstrel Dick (a boy minstrel becomes a courtier, 1891) and Howard Spring's Darkie and Co.
