Through the influence of Wilfrid, Benedict Biscop, and Dunstan, the Benedictine Rule spread with extraordinary rapidity, and in the North it was adopted in most of the monasteries that had been founded by the Celtic missionaries from Iona. Many of the episcopal sees of England were founded and governed by the Benedictines, and no fewer than nine of the old cathedrals were served by the black monks of the priories attached to them. Monasteries served as hospitals and places of refuge for the weak and homeless. The monks studied the healing properties of plants and minerals to alleviate the sufferings of the sick."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelred the Unready", "response": ["Both boys, \u00c6thelred certainly, were too young to have played any significant part in the political manoeuvring which followed Edgar's death. It was the brothers' supporters, and not the brothers themselves, who were responsible for the turmoil which accompanied the choice of a successor to the throne. \u00c6thelred's cause was led by his mother and included \u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia and Bishop \u00c6thelwold of Winchester, while Edward's claim was supported by Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury and Oswald, the Archbishop of York among other noblemen, notably \u00c6thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, and Byrhtnoth, ealdorman of Essex. In the end, Edward's supporters proved the more powerful and persuasive, and he was crowned king at Kingston upon Thames before the year was out.", "Edward reigned for only three years before he was murdered by members of his brother's household. Though little is known about Edward's short reign, it is known that it was marked by political turmoil. Edgar had made extensive grants of land to monasteries which pursued the new monastic ideals of ecclesiastical reform, but these disrupted aristocratic families' traditional patronage. The end of his firm rule saw a reversal of this policy, with aristocrats recovering their lost properties or seizing new ones. This was opposed by Dunstan, but according to Cyril Hart, \"The presence of supporters of church reform on both sides indicates that the conflict between them depended as much on issues of land ownership and local power as on ecclesiastical legitimacy. Adherents of both Edward and \u00c6thelred can be seen appropriating, or recovering, monastic lands.\" Nevertheless, favour for Edward must have been strong among the monastic communities. When Edward was killed at \u00c6thelred's estate at Corfe Castle in Dorset in March 978, the job of recording the event, as well as reactions to it, fell to monastic writers. Stenton offers a summary of the earliest account of Edward's murder, which comes from a work praising the life of St Oswald:", "Nevertheless, at first, the outlook of the new king's officers and counsellors seems in no way to have been bleak. According to one chronicler, the coronation of \u00c6thelred took place with much rejoicing by the councillors of the English people. Simon Keynes notes that \"Byrhtferth of Ramsey states similarly that when \u00c6thelred was consecrated king, by Archbishop Dunstan and Archbishop Oswald, 'there was great joy at his consecration', and describes the king in this connection as 'a young man in respect of years, elegant in his manners, with an attractive face and handsome appearance'.\" ", "\u00c6thelred was between nine and twelve years old when he became king and affairs were initially managed by leading councillors such as \u00c6thelwold, bishop of Winchester, Queen \u00c6lfthryth and Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury. \u00c6thelwold was especially influential and when he died, on 1 August 984, \u00c6thelred abandoned his early councillors and launched on policies which involved encroachment on church privileges, to his later regret. In a charter of 993 he stated that \u00c6thelwold's death had deprived the country of one \"whose industry and pastoral care administered not only to my interest but also to that of all inhabitants of the country.\" ", "Later perspectives of \u00c6thelred have been less than flattering. Numerous legends and anecdotes have sprung up to explain his shortcomings, often elaborating abusively on his character and failures. One such anecdote is given by William of Malmesbury (lived \u00a01080 \u2013 \u00a01143), who reports that \u00c6thelred had defecated in the baptismal font as a child, which led St Dunstan to prophesy that the English monarchy would be overthrown during his reign. This story is, however, a fabrication, and a similar story is told of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Copronymus, another mediaeval monarch who was unpopular among certain of his subjects."]}, {"page": "Edmund I", "response": ["The major religious movement of the tenth century, the English Benedictine Reform, reached its peak under Edgar, but Edmund's reign was important in its early stages. He appointed Dunstan abbot of Glastonbury, where he was joined by \u00c6thelwold. They were to be two of the leaders of the reform and they made the abbey the first important centre for disseminating it. Unlike the circle of his son Edgar, Edmund did not take the view that Benedictine monasticism was the only worthwhile religious life and he also patronised unreformed (non-Benedictine) establishments.", "Benedictine monasticism had flourished in England in the seventh and eighth centuries, but it severely declined in the late eighth and ninth centuries. By the time Alfred came to the throne in 871, monasteries and knowledge of Latin were at a low ebb, but there was a gradual revival from Alfred's time onwards. This accelerated during \u00c6thelstan's reign, and two leaders of the later tenth century English Benedictine Reform, Dunstan and \u00c6thelwold, reached maturity in \u00c6thelstan's cosmopolitan, intellectual court of the 930s.", "The major religious movement of the tenth century, the English Benedictine Reform, reached its peak under Edgar, but Edmund's reign was important in the early stages, which were led by Oda and \u00c6lfheah, both of whom were monks. Oda had strong connections with Continental centres of reform, especially Fleury Abbey. He had been a leading counsellor of \u00c6thelstan and had helped to negotiate the return of Louis to France as king of the Franks in 936. Dunstan was to be a key figure in the reform and Archbishop of Canterbury, and according to his first biographer he was a leading figure at Edmund's court until his enemies persuaded Edmund to expel him, only for the king to have a change of heart after a narrow escape from death and give him a royal estate at Glastonbury, including its abbey.  Williams rejects the story because there is no evidence that he was influential in this period; his brother attested charters, but he did not. Edmund may have given Dunstan the abbey to keep him at a distance because he was too much of a disruptive influence at court, but the king gave generous grants of land to Glastonbury and their relationship laid the ground for the abbey's wealth and prestige in the next decades. Dunstan was joined by \u00c6thelwold, another future reform leader, and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury, which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform. ", ":While the glorious Edmund, king of the English, was at the royal township called Pucklechurch in English, in seeking to rescue his steward from Leofa, a most wicked thief, lest he be killed, was himself killed by the same man on the feast of St Augustine, teacher of the English, on Tuesday, 26 May, in the fourth indiction, having completed five years and seven months of his reign. He was borne to Glastonbury, and buried by the abbot, St Dunstan. ", "Like his son Edgar thirty years later, Edmund was buried at Glastonbury Abbey. The location may have reflected its spiritual prestige and royal endorsement of the monastic reform movement, but as his death was unexpected it is more likely that Dunstan was successful in claiming the body. His sons were still young children, so he was succeeded as king by his brother Eadred, who was in turn succeeded by Edmund's elder son Eadwig in 955."]}, {"page": "Horseshoe", "response": ["Horseshoes have long been considered lucky.

The superstition acquired a further Christian twist due to a legend surrounding the 10th-century saint Dunstan, who worked as a blacksmith before becoming Archbishop of Canterbury. The legend recounts that, one day, the Devil walked into Dunstan's shop and asked him to shoe his horse. Dunstan pretended not to recognize him, and agreed to the request; but rather than nailing the shoe to the horse's hoof, he nailed it to the Devil's own foot, causing him great pain. Dunstan eventually agreed to remove the shoe, but only after extracting a promise that the Devil would never enter a household with a horseshoe nailed to the door.", "*The True Legend of St. Dunstan and the Devil by Edward G.

For many years, this was the only monastery in England that strictly followed the Benedictine Rule and observed complete monastic discipline. What Mechthild Gretsch calls an \"Aldhelm Seminar\" developed at Glastonbury, and the effects of this seminar on the curriculum of learning and study in Anglo-Saxon England were enormous. Royal power was put behind the reforming impulses of Dunstan and Athelwold, helping them to enforce their reform ideas. This happened first at the Old Minster in Winchester, before the reformers built new foundations and refoundations at Thorney, Peterborough, and Ely, among other places. Benedictine monasticism spread throughout England, and these became centers of learning again, run by people trained in Glastonbury, with one rule, the works of Aldhelm at the center of their curricula but also influenced by the vernacular efforts of Alfred.

Dunstan dragged him back to the banquet, earning the enmity of Eadwig and the two women, and at \u00c6thelgifu's instigation Dunstan was deprived of his abbacy of Glastonbury and forced into exile.", "The contemporary record of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports Eadwig's accession and Dunstan fleeing England in 957, but does not explain why Dunstan fled. Thus this report of a feud between Eadwig and Dunstan could either have been based on a true incident of a political quarrel for power between a young king and powerful church officials who wished to control the king and who later spread this legend to blacken his reputation, or it could be mere folklore; the Chronicle also tells of Oda putting aside the King's marriage on the grounds Eadwig and his wife were \"too related\".Cavendish, Rishard. \"Death of King Eadwig of the English\", History Today, Vol. 59 Issue 10 October 2009", "The account of the quarrel with Dunstan and Cynesige, bishop of Lichfield at the coronation feast is recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and in the later chronicle of John of Worcester and was written by monks supportive of Dunstan's position. The \"cavorting\" in question consisted of Eadwig (then only 16) being away from the feast with \u00c6lfgifu and her mother \u00c6thelgifu.

Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, the archbishops Dunstan of Canterbury and Oswald of York.", "Later sources of questionable reliability address the identity of Edward's mother. The earliest such source is a life of Dunstan by Osbern of Canterbury, probably written in the 1080s. Osbern writes that Edward's mother was a nun at Wilton Abbey whom the king seduced.Hart, \"Edward\", p. 783; Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, p. 3. When Eadmer wrote a life of Dunstan some decades later, he included an account of Edward's parentage obtained from Nicholas of Worcester.

Cyril Hart argues that the contradictions regarding the identity of Edward's mother, and the fact that Edmund appears to have been regarded as the legitimate heir until his death in 971, suggest that Edward was probably illegitimate. However, Barbara Yorke thinks that \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was Edgar's wife, but \u00c6lfthryth was a consecrated queen when she gave birth to her sons, who were therefore considered more \"legitimate\" than Edward.Yorke, \"The Women in Edgar's Life\", pp. 147\u201348 \u00c6thelwold denied that Edward was legitimate, but Yorke considers this \"opportunist special pleading\".Yorke, \"\u00c6thelwold and the Politics of the Tenth Century\", p. 86", "Edgar had been a strong ruler who had forced monastic reforms on a probably unwilling church and nobility, aided by the leading clerics of the day, Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury; Oswald of Worcester, Archbishop of York; and Bishop \u00c6thelwold of Winchester.

Secular clergy, many of whom would have been members of the nobility, had been expelled from the new monasteries. While Edgar lived, he strongly supported the reformers, but following his death, the discontents which these changes had provoked came into the open.John, Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 113\u20139; Hart, \"Edward\", pp. 783\u20134; Miller, \"Edgar\"; Higham, Death of Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 2\u20134; Fisher, \"Anti-Monastic Reaction\", pp. 254\u2013255 & 266.", "The leading figures had all been supporters of the reform, but they were no longer united.

The Queen Dowager certainly supported the claims of her son \u00c6thelred, aided by Bishop \u00c6thelwold; and Dunstan supported Edward, aided by his fellow archbishop Oswald. It is likely that Ealdorman \u00c6lfhere and his allies supported \u00c6thelred and that \u00c6thelwine and his allies supported Edward, although some historians suggest the opposite.While Higham, Miller and Williams suggest that \u00c6lfhere supported \u00c6thelred, Hart makes \u00c6thelwine and his party the supporters of \u00c6thelred.", "Later sources suggest that perceptions of legitimacy played a part in the arguments, as did the relative age of the two candidates. In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at Kingston upon Thames, most likely in 975.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, p. 10; Miller, \"Edward the Martyr\". Dales, Dunstan, p. 100, suggests that the inauguration may have taken place in March 976. There is evidence that the settlement involved a degree of compromise. \u00c6thelred appears to have been given lands which normally belonged to the king's sons, some of which had been granted by Edgar to Abingdon Abbey and which were forcibly repossessed for \u00c6thelred by the leading nobles.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, p. 10; this seizure is recorded in charter S 937.", "After recording Edward's succession, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that a comet appeared, and that famine and \"manifold disturbances\" followed.Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 121, Ms. D & E, s.a. 975 & p. 122, Ms. C, s.a. 976. The \"manifold disturbances\", sometimes called the anti-monastic reaction, appear to have started soon after Edgar's death. During this time, the experienced Ealdorman Oslac of Northumbria, effective ruler of much of northern England, was exiled due to unknown circumstances.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, p. 11; Higham, Death of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 10; Fisher, \"Anti-Monastic Reaction\", p. 268; Dales, Dunstan, p. 100; Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 121, Ms. D, s.a. 975. Oslac was followed as ealdorman by Thored, either Oslac's son of that name or Thored Gunnar's son mentioned by the Chronicle in 966.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, p. 24; Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 119, Ms. E, s.a. 966.", "In some places, the secular clergy who had been driven from the monasteries returned, driving the regular clergy out in their turn. Bishop \u00c6thelwold had been the main enemy of the seculars, and Archbishop Dunstan appears to have done little to aid his fellow reformer at this time.Hart, \"Edward\", p. 784. More generally, the magnates took the opportunity to undo many of Edgar's grants to monasteries and to force the abbots to rewrite leases and loans to favour the local nobility. Ealdorman \u00c6lfhere was the leader in this regard, attacking Oswald's network of monasteries across Mercia.Williams, \"\u00c6lfhere\". \u00c6lfhere was remembered as a generous patron and protector of the reformed Glastonbury Abbey. \u00c6lfhere's rival \u00c6thelwine, while a staunch protector of his family monastery of Ramsey Abbey, treated Ely Abbey and other monasteries harshly.Fisher, \"Anti-Monastic Reaction\", pp. 266\u2013267; Hart, \"\u00c6thelwine\". Dales, Dunstan, p. 101. At some point during these disorders, \u00c6lfhere and \u00c6thelwine appear to have come close to open warfare. This may well have been related to \u00c6lfhere's ambitions in East Anglia and to attacks upon Ramsey Abbey. \u00c6thelwine, supported by his kinsman Ealdorman Byrhtnoth of Essex and others unspecified, mustered an army and caused \u00c6lfhere to back down.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, pp. 10\u201311.", "Very few charters survive from Edward's reign, perhaps as few as three, leaving Edward's brief reign in obscurity.  By contrast, numerous charters survived from the reigns of his father Edgar and half-brother \u00c6thelred.  All of the surviving Edward charters concern the royal heartland of Wessex; two deal with Crediton where Edward's former tutor Sideman was bishop.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, p. 11; Hart, \"Edward\", p. 784; Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 122, Ms. C, s.a. 977. During Edgar's reign, dies for coins were cut only at Winchester and distributed from there to other mints across the kingdom.  Edward's reign permitted dies to be cut locally at York and at Lincoln. The general impression is of a reduction or breakdown of royal authority in the midlands and north.Hart, \"Edward\", p. 784; Higham, Death of Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 11 & 13. The machinery of government continued to function, as councils and synods met as customary during Edward's reign, at Kirtlington in Oxfordshire after Easter 977, and again at Calne in Wiltshire the following year. During the meeting at Calne, some councillors were killed and others injured by the collapse of the floor of their room.Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 122, Ms. E, s.a. 977 & p. 123, Ms. C, s.a. 978; Dales, Dunstan, p. 102; Hart, \"\u00c6thelwine\"; Higham, Death of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 13.", "Later sources, further removed from events, such as the late 11th-century Passio S. Eadwardi and John of Worcester, claim that \u00c6lfthryth organised the killing of Edward, while Henry of Huntingdon wrote that she killed Edward herself.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, pp. 12\u201313; Miller, \"Edward the Martyr\"; Dales, Dunstan, p. 103.", "Modern historians have offered a variety of interpretations of Edward's killing. Three main theories have been proposed. Firstly, that Edward was killed, as the life of Oswald claims, by nobles in \u00c6thelred's service, either as a result of a personal quarrel, or to place their master on the throne.So, for example, Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, p. 12; Dales, Dunstan, p. 103. The life of Oswald portrays Edward as an unstable young man who, according to Frank Stenton: \"had offended many important persons by his intolerable violence of speech and behaviour. Long after he had passed into veneration as a saint it was remembered that his outbursts of rage had alarmed all who knew him, and especially the members of his own household.\"Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 372  This may be a trope of hagiography.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, pp. 8\u20139."]}, {"page": "Edgar the Peaceful", "response": ["Edgar  ( ; 8 July 975), known as Edgar the Peaceful or Edgar the Peaceable, was King of the English from 959 until his death.

As king, Edgar further consolidated the political unity achieved by his predecessors, with his reign being noted for its relative stability. His most trusted advisor was Dunstan, whom he recalled from exile and made Archbishop of Canterbury. The pinnacle of Edgar's reign was his coronation at Bath in 973, which was organised by Dunstan and forms the basis for the current coronation ceremony. After his death he was succeeded by his son Edward, although the succession was disputed.", "Eadwig was not a popular king, and his reign was marked by conflict with nobles and the Church, primarily St Dunstan and Archbishop Oda. In 957, the thanes of Mercia and Northumbria changed their allegiance to Edgar.", "One of Edgar's first actions was to recall Dunstan from exile and have him made Bishop of Worcester and Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, subsequently Bishop of London and later, Archbishop of Canterbury. Dunstan remained Edgar's advisor throughout his reign. While Edgar may not have been a particularly peaceable man, his reign was peaceful. The Kingdom of England was well established, and Edgar consolidated the political unity achieved by his predecessors. By the end of his reign, England was sufficiently unified that it was unlikely to regress back to a state of division among rival kingships, as it had to an extent under the reign of Eadred. William Blackstone mentions that King Edgar standardised measure throughout the realm.Blackstone, \"Of the King's Prerogative\" Bk. 1, Ch. 7 According to George Molyneaux, Edgar's reign, \"far more than the reigns of either Alfred or \u00c6thelstan, was probably the most pivotal phase in the development of the institutional structures that were fundamental to royal rule in the eleventh-century kingdom\". Indeed, an early eleventh century king Cnut the Great states in a letter to his subjects that it is my will that all the nation, ecclesiastical and lay, shall steadfastly observe Edgar's laws, which all men have chosen and sworn at Oxford.Trow, Cnut, pp.168\u201369.", "The Monastic Reform Movement that introduced the Benedictine Rule to England's monastic communities peaked during the era of Dunstan, \u00c6thelwold, and Oswald (historians continue to debate the extent and significance of this movement).", "Edgar was crowned at Bath and along with his wife \u00c6lfthryth was anointed, setting a precedent for a coronation of a queen in England itself. Edgar's coronation did not happen until 973, in an imperial ceremony planned not as the initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that must have taken a great deal of preliminary diplomacy).

He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source.
