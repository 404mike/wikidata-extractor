He acquired the reputation as a fearless man-marker, and if 'dour' described McGrory's approach on the field, it aptly summed up the non-nonsense Scot's personality off it. After an early 7\u20131 aberration at Hull City, Stoke, with McGrory a major influence at the back, lost only two of their next 27 matches, with the defence conceding just six goals in 16 matches. The run allowed Stoke to claim second spot in 1921\u201322 to gain promotion to the First Division. McGrory proved to be one of the few Stoke players to cope with the top-flight as Stoke were relegated back to the Second Division. He took over from Alec Milne as club captain in 1925 a position he did not lose for ten years. Stoke suffered relegation again in 1925\u201326 but McGrory's drive helped Stoke win the Third Division North title in 1926\u201327."]}, {"page": "1912\u201313 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Alec Milne"]}, {"page": "1913\u201314 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Alec Milne"]}, {"page": "1914\u201315 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Alec Milne"]}, {"page": "1919\u201320 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Alec Milne"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Alec Milne"]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Alec Milne"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Alec Milne"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["A strong new chairman emerged with the arrival in August 1924 of Mr A.
