She is a very kind, if awkward, girl who is frequently scolded by Mrs Bridges. In the episode I Dies From Love, Emily falls hopelessly in love with a footman named William from the household of Lady Bellamy's committee associate, Mrs. Van Groeben.   They spend several of their days off together, and Emily desperately wants to marry him. However, when an envious Mrs. Van Groeben tells William he cannot see Emily any more, William drops her, revealing that he never cared about her anyway; he tells his mistress \"It was only a bit of fun\". But no-one (except for Rose) really understands how much in love Emily is.  Mrs. Bridges quite savagely dresses Emily down about her affections for William. She is completely lost without William, and when he cruelly ignores her on his next visit to the house and returns her love letter unopened, Emily is so upset she commits suicide. Mrs. Bridges's conscience over the suicide is not assuaged until Sarah, an under-parlour maid who has worked for a carnival, leads a fake seance in which Sarah relays Emily's forgiveness to Mrs. Bridges."]}, {"page": "1945 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["* 5 December \u2013 Evin Crowley, actress."]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role", "response": ["| Evin Crowley"]}, {"page": "24th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Evin Crowley \u2013 Ryan's Daughter as Moureen Cassidy"]}, {"page": "Crowley (surname)", "response": ["*Evin Crowley (born 1945), Northern Irish actress"]}, {"page": "I Dies from Love", "response": ["*Evin Crowley (Emily) "]}, {"page": "Evin (name)", "response": ["*Evin Crowley (born 1945), British actress"]}, {"page": "Ben Hall (TV series)", "response": ["Ben Hall is a 1975 Australian TV series based on the bush ranger Ben Hall.Albert Moran, Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series, AFTRS 1993 p 74 It stars Jon Finch in the titular role, Evin Crowley as Biddy Hall, John Castle as bushranger Frank Gardiner, Brian Blain as Sir Frederick Pottinger, Jack Charles as Billy Dargin and John Orcsik as John Gilbert (bushranger)."]}, {"page": "The Path of Duty", "response": ["* Evin Crowley (Emily)"]}]}}
