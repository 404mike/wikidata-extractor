Danby died in 1833, but his widow continued to live at the house with her second husband, naval officer Octavius Vernon Harcourt (High Sheriff for 1849) until her own death in 1879.

A church is mentioned in the entry for the settlement in the Domesday Book when the lord of the manor was Gospatric, but it is not known exactly where it was sited and many have doubted that any part of the original church survives as part of the current architecture save for the odd stone in the church's walls. However, archaeological discoveries, most notably 57 Saxon bodies, have led to estimations that the site has been the place of Christian worship for over 1,400 years.In 1988, Yorkshire Water were laying a pipeline in the area and at least 57 skeletons were unearthed. They were dated to between 679 and 1011 AD and were all found a very short distance from the present church. The site of the bodies has now been marked with a plaque labelling it the Lost Graveyard. After a long evaluation by archaeologists, the bodies were re-interred in the present church's graveyard in 2009. Studies revealed that all the bodies were facing east (as per the early Christian tradition) and that they had not died as a result of battle or disease. The church itself was started in the 12th century with additions in the 14th, 16th and 19th centuries. The restoration of the church between 1855 and 1863 was down to Octavius Vernon Harcourt who had married the widow of William Danby in 1823. The church was restored after lightning struck the tower in July 1855. During the 19th century renovations, several carved stones of Anglo-Saxon origin were found to be embedded within the church walls with more being unearthed when the foundations were maintained. It was grade II* listed in 1966."]}]}}
