He was the last surviving player to play under Herbert Chapman while at Huddersfield.\nWalter's early footballing experience came while serving in the Gloucestershire Regiment during the First World War, when he represented the Third Battalion of the Glorious Glosters, before joining Horfield United in the Horfield area of his home city of Bristol. After a year playing in the Bristol and Suburban Association Football League, he joined his first professional team in 1919 when he signed for Bristol Rovers.\nLater in life he worked as a groundsman, firstly for the Bristol Co-Operative Society, before taking responsibility for Bristol City's Ashton Gate pitch in 1955. He was later appointed as an assistant coach at his former club, Bristol Rovers, in 1960 when he was aged 65.\nIn Huddersfield's final game at Leeds Road, against Blackpool on 30 April 1994, he was the guest of honour. He was also present for Town's visit to Bristol Rovers' Twerton Park. On 5 November 1994, he made English football history as he became the oldest living professional player at 99 years, on the death of former Brighton & Hove Albion player Zillwood March in his 102nd year.", "link_mentions": {}}}
