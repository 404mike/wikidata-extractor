He was the elder brother of Charles Merivale, and father of the poet Herman Charles Merivale.\nHe was born at Dawlish, Devon to John Herman Merivale (1770\u20131844) and Louisa Heath Drury. He was educated at Harrow School.  In 1823 he entered Oriel College, Oxford. In 1825 he became a scholar of Trinity College and also won the Ireland scholarship, and three years later he was elected fellow of Balliol College.  He became a member of the Inner Temple and practised on the western circuit, being made in 1841 recorder of Falmouth, Helston and Penzance.\nFrom 1837 to 1842 he was professor of political economy at Oxford in this capacity he delivered a course of lectures on the British Colonies in which he dealt with questions of emigration, employment of labour and the allotment of public lands.  The reputation he secured by these lectures had much to do with his appointment in 1847 as Assistant Under-Secretary for the colonies, and in the next year he became Permanent Under-Secretary.  In 1859 he was transferred to the permanent under-secretaryship for India, receiving the distinction of CB.  In 1870, Merivale was awarded the degree of DCL by Oxford University. He died in 1874 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.\nBesides his Lectures on Colonization and Colonies (1841), he published Historical Studies (1865), and completed the Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis (1867); he wrote the second volume of the Life of Sir Henry Lawrence (1872) in continuation of Sir Herbert Edwardes's work.\nA tribute to his powers as an original thinker by his chief at the Colonial Office, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, is printed with a notice of his career which his brother contributed to the Transactions (1884) of the Devonshire Association.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gilbert Arthur \u00e0 Beckett", "response": ["In the following year, he furnished the 'legend' to Herman Merivale's tragedy 'The White Pilgrim,' first given at the Court in February 1874.

In 1865 their authenticity was questioned by Herman Merivale in the Fortnightly Review, but James Gairdner countered that they were genuine in the same periodical.

Ten years later the originals of Fenn's third and fourth volumes, with ninety-five unpublished letters, were found at Roydon Hall, Norfolk, the seat of George Frere.

His work was largely sentimental and his depictions of fractured father-daughter relationships, contested fortunes, mistaken identities, and trusting country folk versus scheming city dwellers reflect the melodramatic tastes of Victorian audiences in the second half of the century.  Simpson wrote more than 25 plays in a variety of styles. One of his most successful works was A Scrap of Paper, an adaptation of Les Pattes de mouche by Victorien Sardou, which opened at the St. James's Theatre on 22 April 1861. On 10 May 1865 Simpson's A Fair Pretender became one of the first plays staged at Marie Effie Wilton's Prince of Wales's Theatre.  The Times (13 May 1865) described the play as \"nightly thronged by one of the most fashionable audiences in London.\" In 1865 Simpson published Carl Maria von Weber: The Life of an Artist, a two-volume translation of the 1864 memoir of the composer by his son, Baron Max Maria von Weber. In 1868 Simpson was elected secretary of the Dramatic Authors' Society, which had been founded in 1833. In The profession of the Playwright: British Theatre 1800-1900 (1992). Simpson's output was less prolific in the 1870s, perhaps as a consequence of his duties with the Dramatic Authors' Society, and he turned increasingly to adaptation and collaborations. In 1873 Simpson joined the young dramatist Herman Merivale to write Alone, which premiered at the Royal Court Theatre on 25 October. Simpson used Charles Dickens's novel Bleak House (1853) as the basis for Lady Dedlock's Secret, which premiered at Her Majesty's Theatre in Aberdeen on 3 April 1874 and appeared in Liverpool the same year but did not play in London until it opened at the Opera Comique on 26 March 1884. He collaborated with Merivale on an adaptation of Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities (1859) titled All for Her, which opened at the Mirror Theatre on 18 October 1875 and was revived into the 1890s. He also collaborated with Claude Templar on The Scar on the Wrist, which premiered at the St. James's on 9 March 1878, and on Zillah, which opened at the Lyceum in August 1879.
