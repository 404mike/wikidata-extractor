It was thought that the principle of compositionality fails for these logics, so that a Tarskian truth definition could not provide a suitable semantics. To get around this problem, the quantifiers were given a game-theoretic meaning. Specifically, the approach is the same as in classical propositional logic, except that the players do not always have perfect information about previous moves by the other player. Wilfrid Hodges has proposed a compositional semantics and proved it equivalent to game semantics for IF-logics."]}, {"page": "Ehrenfeucht\u2013Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game", "response": ["it was formulated as a game by Andrzej Ehrenfeucht.An application of games to the completeness problem for formalized theories, A.

It is a semantic method\u2014like Wittgenstein's truth tables or J. Alan Robinson's resolution\u2014as opposed to the proof of theorems in a formal system, such as the axiomatic systems employed by Frege, Russell and Whitehead, and Hilbert, or even Gentzen's natural deduction.  Semantic tableaux are an effective decision procedure for propositional logic, whereas they are only semi-effective for first-order logic, since first-order logic is undecidable, as showed by Church's theorem. This method is considered by many to be intuitively simple, particularly for students who are not acquainted with the study of logic, and it is faster than the truth-table method (which requires a table with 2n rows for a sentence with n propositional letters). For these reasons, Wilfrid Hodges for example presents semantic tableaux in his introductory textbook, Logic, and Melvin Fitting does the same in his presentation of first-order logic for computer scientists, First-order logic and automated theorem proving."]}, {"page": "Wilfrid hodges", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wilfrid Hodges "]}, {"page": "Alex Wilkie", "response": ["Alex Wilkie attended Aylesbury Grammar School and went on to gain his BSc in mathematics with first class honours from University College London in 1969, his MSc (in mathematical logic) from the University of London in 1970, and his PhD from the Bedford College, University of London in 1973 under the supervision of Wilfrid Hodges with a dissertation titled Models of Number Theory.
