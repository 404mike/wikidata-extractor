When she had reached as far as she could go here, she was advised to go to the City of Liverpool gym club. In 2002, Roberts joined the British Junior Europeans team even though her earlier rankings (20th and 18th) at the Espoir British championship had not been strong. Roberts performance on beam was one of the few performances by a junior to be broadcast on Greek television, which brought Roberts considerable popularity. Roberts performed strongly at a number of competitions in 2002 before an elbow injury in 2003 caused a temporary withdrawal from competition. Following a quick recovery, she has resumed successful competition, including taking gold on the balance beam competition in the Northern European Gymnastics Championship in Lisburn in 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gymnastics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| || ||Melanie Roberts||13.450||13.200||12.800||13.150||52.600"]}, {"page": "Melanie Roberts (disambiguation)", "response": ["Melanie Roberts is a British gymnast.", "Melanie Roberts may also refer to:", "*Melanie Roberts, see Tameside Council election, 2007", "*Melanie Roberts, character in Village of the Damned (1995 film)"]}, {"page": "2006 European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Melanie Roberts"]}, {"page": "2002 European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Melanie Roberts"]}]}}
