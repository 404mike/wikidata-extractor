She was one of the leading female codebreakers at Bletchley Park.She later became a historian of gardening who campaigned to save historic parks and gardens, and an author. Batey was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal in 1985, and made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1987, in both cases for her work on the conservation of gardens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dulwich", "response": ["Famous people born in the area include: artist Madge Tennent in 1889; the author, Enid Blyton in 1897; the first compiler of the London A-Z, Phyllis Pearsall in East Dulwich in 1906, she went on to live in Dulwich Village; code breaker extraordinaire Mavis Batey, then Mavis Lever, was born in Dulwich on May 5, 1921; the war-time singer Anne Shelton who lived on Court Lane until shortly before her death in 1994; also on Court Lane, Dr Reginald John Gladstone FRSE embryologist, lived here until his house was destroyed in the blitz in 1941; footballer Trevor Sinclair in 1973; the actor Tim Roth in 1961; the TV personality Lisa Vanderpump in 1960; and actress Sally Hawkins in 1976."]}, {"page": "Battle of Cape Matapan", "response": ["In late March 1941, as British ships of the Mediterranean Fleet covered troop movements to Greece, Mavis Batey, a cryptanalyst at Bletchley Park, made a breakthrough, reading the Italian naval Enigma for the first time. The first message, the cryptic \"Today\u2019s the day minus three,\" was followed three days later by a second message reporting the sailing of an Italian battle fleet comprising one battleship, six heavy and two light cruisers, plus destroyers to attack the merchant convoys supplying British forces. As always with Enigma, the intelligence breakthrough was concealed from the Italians by ensuring there was a plausible, visible reason for the Allies to have detected and intercepted their fleet. In this case, it was a carefully directed reconnaissance plane.See the report in the official Admiralty publication of 1943, East of Malta, West of Suez: The Admiralty Account of the Naval War in the Mediterranean (London, His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1943), where the detection of the Italian force is credited to \"one of Formidable's aircraft on reconnaissance.\" (p. 56)", "For reasons of secrecy, code breakers at the GC&CS were very rarely informed of the operational effects of their work, but their impact on the Battle of Cape Matapan was an exception. A few weeks after the battle, Admiral Cunningham dropped into Bletchley Park to congratulate Dilly and his girls, with a positive impact on morale: Mavis Batey, one of the code breakers, remembers: \"Our sense of elation knew no bounds when Cunningham himself came down in person to thank and congratulate us\". Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, stated: \"Tell Dilly that we have won a great victory in the Mediterranean and it is entirely due to his girls\".", "For decades after the end of the Second World War, the involvement of the GC&CS, as well as the code-breaking methods used, were kept secret. A number of controversial theories were published before more complete accounts emerged after records were eventually declassified in 1978. Only later, after Dilly's rodding method was demonstrated by Mavis Batey to the Admiral in charge of naval history, were Italian official records corrected. In 1966, H. Montgomery Hyde published a story alleging that an American spy, Betty Thorpe, had seduced Admiral Alberto Lais (the Italian naval attach\u00e9 in Washington, D.C.), and that she had obtained a codebook used by the British to defeat the Italians at Matapan. Hyde was found guilty of libelling the dead, but evidence of GC&CS involvement was not made public at that time. In 1980, the BBC series Spy! included similar allegations about a spy called 'Cynthia' who obtained a codebook. In 1974, Frederick Winterbotham in The Ultra Secret falsely credited the decryption of Luftwaffe Enigma traffic."]}, {"page": "Hans-Thilo Schmidt", "response": ["*Mavis Batey, Dilly: The Man Who Broke Enigmas.
