After Francis James died in 1928, his son Christopher Chavasse launched a memorial appeal in his father's name to fund the project, raising \u00a3150,000 from donors including Ella Rowcroft to convert and build new buildings on the site. St Peter's was licensed by the University as a Hostel that year and opened with 13 residents. The following year, 1929, it was recognised as a Permanent Private Hall and grew to 40 students.
