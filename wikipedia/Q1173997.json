David Christie was in frequent contact with George Brown who published The Globe newspaper.\nIn the fall of 1849, David Christie was a founding member of the Clear Grit movement.  Along with other Clear Grit supporters, Christie argued for a Canadian brand of republicanism that included the election of a deep number of government representatives.  David Christie also coined the term Clear Grit according to Charles Dent, who traces the term to a discussion between Christie and George Brown where Christie criticised any Reformer who would hang back like Brown, declaring \"We want only men who are Clear Grit\".\nIn 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada. In 1867, he was summoned to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of Erie, Ontario. A Liberal, the Honourable David Christie served until his death in 1880.
