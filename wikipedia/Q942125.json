Mainly known for his dual-position as Governor of Assiniboia, and Governor of Rupert's Land, he played a major role in the development of Western Canada. Mactavish is frequently criticized for his role in the Red River Rebellion.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Simon McTavish (fur trader)", "response": ["Simon's friend, Lachlan MacTavish, had been succeeded as Chief by his son Dugald MacTavish (1782-1855), of Kilchrist Castle; Sheriff of Campbelltown. Simon's sons were well-known to him and waiving the customary cost, Simon took Dugald's second son (John George MacTavish) into the North West Company, where he became a member of the Beaver Club. When the NWC later merged with the Hudson's Bay Company, John continued to work for them and was considered one of their top traders. John later changed the spelling of his name to 'McTavish' in order to match that of his benefactor's, Simon's. John's elder brother, William MacTavish, 21st Chief of the Clan, also entered the fur-trade, working for the HBC and becoming Governor of Rupert's Land and Assiniboia.The paternal lineage of the MacTavish ChiefsThe Myth of a disponed MacTavish Chiefship is put to rest The Chiefs of Clan MacTavish remained in Canada, and the present 27th Chief was born at Montreal in 1951.The paternal lineage of the MacTavish Chiefs"]}, {"page": "Clan MacTavish", "response": ["Back in the 18th century Lachlan's son, Dugald, under age in 1796, did not register the MacTavish arms; and as a grown man, with his duties as the Sheriff Substitute of Kintyre he obviously did not feel inclined to do so, as he was, already, legally known as MacTavish of Dunardry. He died without having re-registered the Arms. Unfortunately, this carried on with his son William MacTavish who had moved to the \"wilds\" of Canada. William also declined to register the Arms. It is nominally suggested by Lord Lyon that at least every other generation re-register the Chiefly Arms, to avoid dormancy of the Clan. As a result of William not matriculating for the arms, the Chiefly line was considered \"lost\", or dormant, until 1949, when the Lord Lyon, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, contacted the MacTavish family in Canada, advising them that they were the Chiefly line, inviting them to petition for the Arms and Chiefship of the Clan. No petition was lodged with the Court of Lord Lyon and the Chiefship remained dormant when, in 1992 Edward Stewart Dugald MacTavish petitioned for the Arms and Chiefship of the clan. He was recognized and matriculated to the Titles of Chief of the Name and Arms, and Chief of the Clan MacTavish in 1997.  The Chiefship was reinstated with the territorial title of MacTavish of Dunardry.", "The search for the rightful heir to the Chiefship of Clan MacTavish was found when Mrs. Margaret MacLeaod was writing The Letters of Letitia Hargrave (Letitia MacTavish Hargrave was the daughter of Sheriff Dugald MacTavish at Campbeltown, Kintrye, Scotland) for the Champlain Society. Mrs. MacLeod's husband, Allan MacLeod, M.D., had taken over the medical practice of one James MacTavish, son of the Governor William MacTavish, HBC, at Red River.

On 19 January, Pag\u00e9 was one of the four members of this convention (along with Ambroise-Dydime L\u00e9pine, John Sutherland, and John Fraser) who went to find out if William MacTavish still considered himself the governor of Assiniboia. MacTavish responded that he was devoid of all authority and strongly urged the formation of a new government. Returning to the convention with this news, Pag\u00e9 raised the motion to adopt the Provisional Government with Louis Riel as president, becoming a councilor of the Provisional Government when it was formed.
