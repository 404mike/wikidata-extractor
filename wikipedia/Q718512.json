Other revolutionaries who frequent her mother and stepfather's house in St. John's Wood included Karl Marx and Louis Blanc. Her early commitment to women's suffrage was influenced by her mother's friend Caroline Ashurst Stansfeld, who was active in the British feminist movement from its origins in the 1840s. These radical affiliations are manifested in Blind's politically charged poetry, and in her own unbending commitment to reform. As Richard Garnett observed, in the society of political refugees and radicals Blind was raised in, \"admiration musts necessarily be reserved for audacity in enterprise, fortitude in adversity... anything breathing unconquerable defiance of the powers that were.\"", "In the early 1870s, after abandoning the male pseudonym she used for her first volume of verse, Blind emerged as a force to be reckoned with in London's literary bohemia. In early January 1870 she delivered a lecture on Percy Bysshe Shelley at the Church of Progress in London, stressing the poet's political radicalism. In July of that year she published a review-essay on William Michael Rossetti's edition of The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley in the Westminster Review that earned the praise of Algernon Charles Swinburne and gained her entry into a formerly all-male group of \"Shelleyites\" that included Swinburne, Rossetti, and Richard Garnett. (Garnett would remain Blind's friend and literary adviser throughout her lifetime.) A year after this essay appeared, Blind began publishing poetry and nonfiction in Dark Blue, a new Oxford-based journal that during its short run published prose and art by many of Britain's leading Pre-Raphaelites and aesthetes. Her wide-ranging publications in this journal are those of a daring feminist aesthete: she wrote sexually subversive poems about haunted lovers, an erudite essay on Icelandic poetry, and a short story exploring the corrosive effects of class divisions on human relations. In the fall of 1872, as her association with Dark Blue was ending, she began reviewing contemporary poetry and fiction for the Athenaeum, where over the next 15 years she passed judgement on a wide range of contemporary writers, ranging from William Morris to Margaret Oliphant. At the end of 1871 she published Selections from the Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley for the Tauchnitz Collection of British Authors, containing an introductory \"Memoir\" of Shelley's life. In the following year, she brought out her translation of David Strauss's The Old Faith and the New: A Confession, which established her reputation as a daring freethinker, following in the footsteps of George Eliot, who had translated The Life of Jesus in 1853. The generic range of these early works (poetry, fiction, criticism, biography, translation), as well as their subject matter and themes (female autonomy and agency, anti-theism, aestheticism, the relationship of literary and political radicalism), indicates the aesthetic principles and themes that would characterize the remainder of Blind's career, while emphasizing the cosmopolitan nature of her sensibility and outlook.", "Despite her diverse literary interests, Blind remained devoted to poetry, as is evident in an 1869 letter to Richard Garnett: \"My only real intense life has been for a long time in writing, and when I cannot swim and float about in the enchanted waters of poetry I am like a fish out of water. I gasp and pant for want of the proper element to breathe in.\"Mathilde Blind ALS to Richard Garnett, 2 July 1869, Blind Correspondence, British Library, Add. MS 6129, ff. 34\u201335. Blind's visits to Scotland in the 1870s and 1880s inspired two poems of considerable compass and ambition: the narrative poem \"The Prophecy of St. Oran\" (published in 1881, but written some years earlier) and The Heather on Fire (1886), a denunciation of the Highland clearances. Both are full of impassioned eloquence and energy, and \"The Prophecy\" in particular has an ample share of the quality Matthew Arnold called \"Celtic magic\".", "Blind's only novel, \"Tarantella\", a prose romance, is a remarkable work in many ways, but was neither a commercial nor a popular success. Richard Garnett wrote that \"the fate of this remarkable book is one of the injustices of literature\". Noting that \"it has an exciting story, interesting characters, ease and naturalness of dialogue\", and \"is the receptacle of much of the writer's most serious thought and intense personal feeling\", Garnett attributes the novel's failure to attract a wide audience to the preference for realism and the \"minute analysis of character\" in the mid-1880s. Tarantella, by contrast, \"is very romantic, very idealistic, very eloquent, and not in the least concerned with minutiae\". Garnett concludes that \"now that the taste for romance has revived\", Blind's novel \"ought to have another chance of taking its rightful place\". While the novel was translated into French in 1893, and reprinted in a single-volume format the same year by T. Fisher Unwin, its coexistence alongside similarly philosophical fictions, including Vernon Lee's A Phantom Lover (1890), Oliver Schreiner's Dreams (1890), and Oscar Wilde's The Portrait of Dorian Gray (1891) did not improve its fortunes.", "*The Poetical Works of Mathilde Blind, edited by Arthur Symons, with a memoir by Richard Garnett (1900)"]}, {"page": "George Croly", "response": ["*Life and times of George IV (1830).
