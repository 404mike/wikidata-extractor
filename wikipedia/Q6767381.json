He made 6 appearances (4 as a substitute) that season, before returning to non-league football. In October 1987 he joined Barrow from Penrith, and in December 1990 he joined Cambridge United from Gretna, but failed to appear in United's league side.\nIn August 1991 he moved to Torquay United for \u00a310,000, scoring only twice in 20 games as Torquay struggled to adapt to life in the old Division Three. He was released after Torquay's relegation, joining Darlington in August 1992. He had a fairly successful season with the Quakers, but left after only one season, returning to non-league football with Gretna. He later moved to Barrow before joining Scottish side Queen of the South in January 1996. From the Dumfries side  he returned to Workington, then moved on to Lancaster City in April 1997. He was Lancaster's top scorer the following season, but in September 1998, the Lancaster Citizen reported that he was in a row with City, because he was training with Gretna and refusing to play for City. He subsequently joined Gretna, later returning to Barrow, before re-joining Gretna in August 1999. In the 2001\u201302 season he was top scorer in the Northern Premier League First Division at the age of 38, scoring 63 goals in Gretna's last two seasons in the Northern Premier League.In the 2002 close season Gretna were elected to play in the Scottish Third Division.
