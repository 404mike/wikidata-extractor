Because of a then-common prejudice against pianists with British-sounding names, her advisors had long urged her to adopt a name with a continental flavour, but she stubbornly refused.

She bought gowns specially designed by Norman Hartnell to cover the cast, and she often wore Hartnell thereafter.

We all used to flock to her concerts, not least because of the extraordinary amount of cleavage she used to show!\".", "In the days of her greatest fame, the critical climate was still stuffy, and her mass appeal and her succession of different-coloured glamorous gowns (some designed by Norman Hartnell) provoked snobbish reaction and led to her being musically under-rated.

For example, her 1941 recording of the \u00c9tude in A-flat, Op. 1, No. 2 by Paul de Schl\u00f6zer is considered unsurpassed.
