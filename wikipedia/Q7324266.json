An anarchist, toper, raconteur, marathon runner and practical joker, he described his pastimes as \"soothsaying, shelling peas and embroidery\" and argued that Adam and Eve were the first anarchists: \"God gave them only one order and they promptly broke it\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford English Dictionary", "response": ["When the print version of the second edition was published in 1989, the response was enthusiastic.

It is, observed Neville, an irony that the overheated   melodrama  that Gibbons most disliked was at the heart of her one great  success;  Gibbons's writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval, but no noticeable literary recognition. Nevertheless, her straightforward, style, unadorned except in parody, is admired by Rachel Cooke, who praises her as \"a sworn enemy of the flatulent, the pompous and the excessively sentimental.\" While short of sentimentality, Gibbons's writing, in prose or verse, did not lack sensitivity. She had what one analyst described as \"a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable\".Schleuter and Schleuter (eds), pp. 190\u201391"]}, {"page": "Stowe School", "response": ["* Richard Boston, (1938-2006), English journalist and author"]}, {"page": "Peace News", "response": ["The magazine campaigned against nuclear weapons, often working with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.Chester and Rigby, p. 69.

Throughout the 1960s, Peace News covered issues such as opposition to the Vietnam War and the Biafran issue in the Nigerian Civil War.

It was founded by journalist Richard Boston, with funding from Monty Python member Terry Jones. The magazine was intended to have a more light-hearted tone than the other countryside and ecology magazines of the time. The founders' working title for the magazine (shortened when it began actual publication) was The Questing Vole, a quotation from the fictitious nature column written by William Boot, the protagonist of Evelyn Waugh's novel Scoop (1938) \u2013 \"Feather-footed through the plashy fens passes the questing vole\".", "Bryan Reading's cartoon strip \"The Belchers\" (commissioned by Richard Boston), featuring the bucolic adventures of metropolitan emigrants Nigel and Fiona Allbran, appeared throughout Voles four-year lifetime."]}, {"page": "Pub game", "response": ["In his book, Beer and Skittles, Richard Boston claims that the first regulation concerning national control of pubs was about pub games; Henry VII's statute of 1495 restricted the playing of \"indoor games which were distracting Tudor pubmen from archery\"."]}, {"page": "Boudu Saved from Drowning", "response": ["Pauline Kael called it, \"not only a lovely fable about a bourgeois attempt to reform an early hippy... but a photographic record of an earlier France.\"Kael, quoted in Richard Boston, Boudu, BFI Film Classics p.41", "Michel Simon was at various times, a boxer, a boxing instructor, a right-wing anarchist, a frequenter of prostitutes, pimps and petty crooks. He was extremely well read, a talented photographer, a hypochondriac, a misanthrope, owner of a vast collection of pornography and with a reputation for unorthodox sexual behaviour which he did not bother to deny. The writer Richard Boston has stated that, \"Whether or not he was a pleasant man, he was certainly a complex one, with a good deal of Boudu in him,\" and Renoir called Simon \"a genius of an actor...Boudu was conceived primarily to make use of the genius of Michel Simon.\"Boston, p.36-37", "Michel Simon called Boudu a pique-assiette, a sponger, while the writer Richard Boston rejected the idea that Boudu had much in common with the hippies of the late 1960s, as Pauline Kael had suggested. \"The Oxford English Dictionary says that hippie is a hipster; a person usually exotically dressed; a beatnik. None of this sounds remotely like Boudu. Boudu doesn't reject conventional values: he never had them in the first place: you wouldn't catch him doing anything as pussy-footing as 'rejecting conventional values.' \" Rather, Boston argues, Boudu is what the French call a marginal. Boudu is anarchic, chaotic, and finally, a fool. An archetype, \"these agents of chaos act out our secret desires. If we see a big bum we might want to kick it: Chaplin does kick it...Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, Boudu, and Hulot are the enemies of conformity, of what can be regulated.

The r\u00e9gime at the school leaned heavily towards sport, in which he was neither interested nor proficient. The headmaster, Stanley Harris, was a celebrated amateur footballer and occasional first class cricketer, but he was reasonably tolerant of Lancaster's disdain for games, and on the whole Lancaster enjoyed his time at the school. His education there was, he later commented, of more importance to him than anything he learned later in his school and university career.Knox, p. 16 He left St Ronan's in 1921, aged thirteen, and went to Charterhouse, where his father and uncles had all been sent.Knox, p. 18 There he was shocked by the bullying and bad language,Boston, pp. 44\u201345 but in addition to its sporty, philistine \"bloods\",Boston, pp. 44 and 47 the school had an intellectual and aesthetic tradition.

On the media God-slots, they pray for anything from better weather to the release of hostages. To me the logic is incomprehensible. If this omnipotent God is in control of the climate then in His infinite wisdom he must have sent the floods and hurricanes and droughts, and if he is capable of releasing the hostages then he must be responsible for their having been taken in the first place.
