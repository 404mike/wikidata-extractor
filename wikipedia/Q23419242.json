He won the 1921 Shawnee Open, 1923 Maine Open, 1924 New England PGA Championship, and the 1924 Massachusetts Open. He finished tied for 9th place in the 1923 PGA Championship, a career-best result in major championships.\nOgg was one of the founding members of the PGA of America, serving as vice president. He was an excellent golf instructor and was the author of the book \"Golf as I Know it\", published posthumously in 1961.\nHe was the first golf club maker to build and patent the forerunner to the modern perimeter-weighted or cavity back iron. Ogg also patented a design for a golf glove.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Jones (golfer)", "response": ["He was influenced by club professional Stewart Maiden, a native of Carnoustie, Scotland. Maiden was the professional at the Atlanta Athletic Club's East Lake Golf Club, who also trained Alexa Stirling, the three-time winner of the U.S. Women's Amateur, who was five years older than Jones but also a prodigy at East Lake. Jones also received golf lessons from Willie Ogg when he was in his teenage years. Jones played frequently with his father, a skilled player himself. The younger Jones sometimes battled his own temper on the course, but later controlled his emotions as he became more experienced. Jones toured the U.S. during World War I from 1917 to 1918, playing exhibition matches before large crowds, often with Alexa Stirling and Perry Adair, to generate income for war relief. Playing in front of such crowds in these matches helped him, as he moved into national competition a bit later on."]}, {"page": "Wilson Staff", "response": ["In 1933 Wilson Advisory Staff member Willie Ogg created a design for distributing weight away from the heel of the club head, moving it towards the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the blade.
