He then left Bramall Lane for Stoke in the Birmingham & District League in 1910. He spent two years at the Victoria Ground and made an impressive contribution, scoring 34 goals in 23 matches in 1910\u201311, his run being ended by a broken leg against Crewe Alexandra on 10 December 1910. He claimed hat-tricks against Dudley Town, Wolves Reserves, Treharris Athletic, and Kettering Town, and finished as the club's joint top-scorer (with Alf Smith) despite only playing in the first half of the season. His goals helped the \"Potters\" to secure the Birmingham & District League title and second place in the Southern League Division Two. After his recovery Peart scored seven goals in 24 games in 1911\u201312, before the directors decided to cash in on their most profitable player."]}, {"page": "List of Stoke City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Alf Smith", "|align=left| Alf Smith", "|align=left| Alf Smith"]}, {"page": "1903\u201304 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alf Smith"]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alf Smith"]}, {"page": "1910\u201311 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alf Smith"]}, {"page": "1911\u201312 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alf Smith"]}, {"page": "1912\u201313 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alf Smith"]}, {"page": "1913\u201314 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alf Smith"]}, {"page": "1914\u201315 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alf Smith"]}, {"page": "List of Stoke City F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|15=||align=\"left\"| Alf Smith||1903\u20131915||67||5||0||0||72"]}, {"page": "Alf Smith (footballer born 1880)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alf Smith (footballer, born 1880)"]}]}}
