At the Battle of the Alma on 20 September, the Connaught Rangers were engaged in the left brigade of the Light Division. Early in the action a Mini\u00e9 ball struck Shirley and became embedded in his prayer book, doing him no harm. As the regiment advanced to support William Norcott with some of the Rifle Brigade and crossed the River Alma, Shirley was ordered by Sir George Buller to have the regiment form square to repel a cavalry attack that never materialised. This allowed part of the 1st Division to overtake them so that the Rangers saw little further action at the battle."]}, {"page": "List of governors of dependent territories in the 19th century", "response": ["::*William Norcott, Lieutenant Governor (1873\u20131878)"]}, {"page": "Norcott, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Norcott"]}, {"page": "Norcott", "response": ["* William Norcott (satirist) (1770\u20131820), Irish lawyer and satirist.", "* William Norcott (1804\u20131886), British soldier."]}]}}
