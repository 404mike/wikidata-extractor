The term \"biblical Unitarianism\" is connected first with Robert Spears and Samuel Sharpe of the Christian Life magazine in the 1880s. It is a neologism (or retronym) that gained increasing currency in nontrinitarian literature during the 20th century as the mainstream Unitarian churches moved away from belief in the Bible and, in the United States, towards merger with Universalism. It has been used since the late 19th century by conservative Christian Unitarians, and sometimes by historians, to refer to Scripture-fundamentalist Unitarians of the 16th\u201318th centuries. Its use is problematic in that Unitarians from the 17th to the 20th centuries all had attachment to the Bible, but in differing ways.", "An early example of the term \"Biblical Unitarianism\" occurs in the British and Foreign Evangelical Review (1882) in an article on the \"Waning of Biblical Unitarianism\".James Oswald Dykes, James Stuart Candlish, Joseph Samuel Exell \u2013 1882 \"Waning of Biblical Unitarianism.

This conflict came to a head in 1876 when Robert Spears resigned from the British and Foreign Unitarian Association and, with the support of Sharpe, a former president of the Association, began to publish a rival magazine.Tim Dowley  Eerdman's handbook to the history of Christianity 1977 p496 \"But in the 1830s James Martineau and some younger Unitarians led a revolt against biblical Unitarianism and its dogmas.
