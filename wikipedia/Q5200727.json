Jackson's battalion was tasked with the capture of a canal crossing. Once over the canal, it was to set up defensive positions and make contact with the adjacent 3rd Guards Battalion. On reaching the canal, the advance of Jackson's company, under the command of Captain Cyril Frisby, was halted by barbed wire together with heavy fire from a German machine-gun post under the bridge on the far side of the canal. Jackson, together with Frisby and two others, got through the wire and climbed down into the canal under intense fire. With a further twelve men joining them, the post was captured."]}, {"page": "Cyril Hubert Frisby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cyril Frisby"]}, {"page": "List of people buried in Brookwood Cemetery", "response": ["*Cyril Frisby VC"]}]}}
