Jazz musicians from the local area as well as international artist played at the club. The late 1970s saw the emergence of a new sound, punk, and it was at the Band on the Wall that many of the Manchester punk bands played. This was part of the New Manchester Review nights, a fanzine and listings magazine which was the starting point for the now defunct City Life. Many notable post-punk bands played during this time including Buzzcocks and the Fall amongst others. The venue was also used by the Manchester Musicians Collective. An album entitled A Manchester Collection was released by Object Records featuring some of those members in April 1979. Several other bands later released music through Factory Records, including Joy Division and A Certain Ratio. In 1982 the venue briefly closed for some internal redevelopment work. It was after the reopening that the Dizzy Gillespie logo was first used. It was during this decade that the venue began to gain an international reputation for so-called \"World Music\" and a programme that covered multiple genres. Performers who went on to gain international reputations included Mick Hucknall, who played on several occasions as Frantic Elevators. Other notable performances came from Purrkur Pillnikk, who supported The Fall for three dates in 1982, with supporting vocals from a young Bj\u00f6rk."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2009", "response": ["*Johnny Roadhouse, 88, British saxophonist."]}, {"page": "Barney James", "response": ["After a career in the armed forces, James studied percussion in Manchester at the Johnny Roadhouse School of Music and the Northern School of Music.
