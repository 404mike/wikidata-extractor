A. Whetter (20 September 1935 \u2013 24 February 2018) was a British historian and politician, noted as a Cornish nationalist and editor of The Cornish Banner (An Baner Kernewek). He contested elections for two Cornish independence parties. A prolific writer, Dr James Whetter was the editor of Mebyon Kernow's monthly magazine Cornish Nation in the early 1970s before later becoming active in the Cornish Nationalist Party. While active in Mebyon Kernow he authored A Celtic Tomorrow - Essays in Cornish Nationalism (MK Publications 1973)  and The Celtic Background of Kernow (MK Publications 1971), the latter intended to assist schoolchildren in a better understanding of Cornish Celtic history and culture.\nWhetter's books include The History of Glasney College (Padstow: Tabb House, 1988), Cornwall in the Seventeenth Century (Padstow: Lodenek Press, 1974) and The History of Falmouth (Redruth: Dyllansow Truran, 1981).\nWhetter gained a PhD from London University and was director of the Roseland Institute, a centre for Cornish Studies at Gorran Haven near St Austell. The institute contains a library of over 20,000 books in the process of being catalogued and put on-line and is the base for the publishing activities of Lyfrow Trelyspen and CNP Publications. The former produces works on Cornish history, essays and related subjects, and the latter, the quarterly Cornish magazine, The Cornish Banner (An Baner Kernewek).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cornish Nationalist Party", "response": ["The Cornish Nationalist Party (CNP; ) is a political party, founded by Dr James Whetter, who campaigned for independence for Cornwall.

By 1680\u20131700 there were probably 7 acres of barley to each 6 acres of wheat. This situation seems to have continued in the period 1700\u20131750 though barley growing may have increased in western districts. Oats was less important than wheat by 1750 and the small acreage of peas and beans appears to have declined. Crop rotations in Devon and Cornwall were simple and traditional. In 1667 Colepresse reported that in both counties a six-course rotation was used; in Cornwall two crops of wheat were followed by three of barley and one of oats or peas. There is other evidence to suggest that in parts of Cornwall a less arduous three or four course rotation was used, as at St Tudy and Lezant in the 1680s. Colepresse in the 1660s reported yields of wheat of 10\u201320 bushels per acre in Cornwall; and yields both of barley and oats of 10\u201315 bushels an acre in Cornwall (the yields for Devon were slightly higher).Harrison (1984), pp. 367\u2013368 In years of a good harvest Cornish farmers were able to export grain along the coast. When the harvest failed as in 1727 and 1728 it was necessary for Cornwall to import grain.Harrison (1984), pp. 371\u2013372 The cultivation of potatoes was much more common in the first half of the 18th century in Cornwall than it was in Devon at the same period. Hemp was grown in Cornwall in fishing districts to supply the fishermen. The production of flax in Cornwall declined in the half century before 1700.Harrison (1984), pp. 373\u2013374 The effects of climate, soils and topography resulted in livestock-rearing being of greater agricultural importance than crops in the south-western counties as a whole and in Cornwall in particular. Cattle breeding was important in the interior of Cornwall and in north Devon. Much of the stock sold in the markets of east Cornwall was sold to graziers for fattening further east.Harrison (1984), p. 375 In the 1710s the farmers of St Germans summered their bullocks on the common moors of St Cleer and St Neot.Harrison (1984), p. 378 The growing of turnips provided winter fodder for sheep and led to an increase in flocks of sheep between 1700 and 1750. There was also greater importance of mutton rather than wool in the 2nd quarter of the 18th century.Harrison (1984), p. 381 Though less than in Devon cider production was a significant proportion of farm output in some districts such as the south east and the number of orchards increased in the latter half of the 17th century.Harrison (1984), p. 383 Cornwall had a larger acreage of hops than any other southwestern county. Hops were grown mainly in the south east of the county and particularly in the parishes of Goran, Mevagissey and St Michael Caerhays. In the 1720s the hop acreage in Cornwall was c. 140 acres.Harrison (1984), p. 385"]}, {"page": "Cornish nationalism", "response": ["*The Cornish Nationalist Party was formed in 1975 by Dr James Whetter and is currently not registered to contest elections."]}, {"page": "Dr James Whetter", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Whetter"]}, {"page": "Pedyr Prior", "response": ["Prior joined the Cornish Nationalist Party on its formation in 1976, and was adopted as its prospective candidate for the St Ives constituency.James Whetter, Cornish essays, 1971-76, p.138 This candidacy did not happen, as he stood down in favour of the MK candidate for the constituency, and subsequently he defected to MK.
