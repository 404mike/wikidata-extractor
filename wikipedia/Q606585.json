Oram F.S.A. (Scot.) is a Scottish historian. He is a professor of medieval and environmental history at the University of Stirling and an honorary lecturer in history at the University of Aberdeen. He is also the director of the Centre for Environmental History and Policy at the University of Stirling. \nHe received his undergraduate training at the University of St. Andrews, where he also carried out his doctoral research, on medieval Galloway. In 2000 he published The Lordship of Galloway (Birlinn). He has since written a biography of King David I of Scotland (Tempus, 2004), and the High Medieval volume, volume 3, in the New Edinburgh History of Scotland series, entitled Domination and Lordship: Scotland, 1070-1230 (2011).\nIn June 2014, Oram was appointed president of the Scottish Castles Association, a registered charity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malcolm III of Scotland", "response": ["Malcolm's kingdom did not extend over the full territory of modern Scotland: many of the islands and the land north of the river Oykel were Scandinavian, and south of the Firth of Forth there were numerous independent or semi-independent realms, including the kingdom of Strathclyde and Bamburgh, and it is not certain what if any power the Scots exerted there on Malcolm's accession.McGuigan, M\u00e1el Coluim III, pp. 16\u201341 Over the course of his reign Malcolm III led at least five invasions into English territory. One of Malcolm's primary achievements was to secure the position of the lineage that ruled Scotland until the late thirteenth century,The question of the name of his family is open. \"House of Dunkeld\" is all but unknown; \"Canmore kings\" and \"Canmore dynasty\" are not universally accepted, nor are Richard Oram's recent \"meic Ma\u00edl Coluim\" or Michael Lynch's \"MacMalcolm\". For discussions and examples: Duncan, pp. 53\u20134; McDonald, Outlaws, p. 3; Barrow, Kingship and Unity, Appendix C; Reid Broun discusses the question of identity at length. McGuigan, M\u00e1el Coluim III, has recently used the term Clann Chr\u00edn\u00e1in, 'children of Cr\u00edn\u00e1n'. although his role as founder of a dynasty has more to do with the propaganda of his descendants than with history.Hammond, p. 21. The first genealogy known which traces descent from Malcolm, rather than from Kenneth MacAlpin (Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn) or Fergus M\u00f3r is dated to the reign of Alexander II. See Broun, pp. 195\u2013200. Malcolm's second wife, St. Margaret of Scotland, is Scotland's only royal saint.", "An English invasion in 1054, with Siward, Earl of Northumbria in command, had as its goal the installation of one \"M\u00e1el Coluim, son of the king of the Cumbrians\". This M\u00e1el Coluim was traditionally identified with the later Malcolm III.See, for instance, Ritchie, Normans, p. 5, or Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 570. Ritchie, p. 5, states that Duncan placed his son, the future Malcolm III of Scotland, in possession of Cumbria as its Prince, and states that Siward invaded Scotland in 1054 to restore him to the Scottish throne. Hector Boece also says this (vol.XII p.249), as does Young, p. 30. The interpretation derives from the Chronicle attributed to  John of Fordun, as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury.Broun, \"Identity of the Kingdom\", pp. 133\u201334; Duncan, Kingship, p. 40 The latter reported that Macbeth was killed in the battle by Siward, but it is known that Macbeth outlived Siward by two years.Oram, David I, p. 29 A. A. M. Duncan argued in 2002 that, using the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry as their source, later writers innocently misidentified \"M\u00e1el Coluim\" with the later Scottish king of the same name.Duncan, Kingship, pp. 37\u201341 Duncan's argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era, such as Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun and Alex Woolf.Broun, \"Identity of the Kingdom\", p. 134; Oram, David I, pp. 18\u201320; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 262 It has also been suggested that M\u00e1el Coluim may have been a son of Owain Foel, British king of StrathclydeDuncan, Kingship of the Scots, p. 41 perhaps by a daughter of Malcolm II, King of Scotland.Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 262"]}, {"page": "Lewis chessmen", "response": ["Richard Oram, Professor of Medieval and Environmental History at the University of Stirling, agreed, arguing that there was no reason for there to be more than \"a sample\" of the collection in London.  These views were dismissed by Margaret Hodge, the then UK Minister of State in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, writing \"It's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?\", noting the law protects purchases and drawing comparisons to major artworks in Europe housed in major cities, with replicas available often where tourism is sufficient, in situ.Burnett, Allan (3 February 2008) \"Stalemate\".

It welcomes short-term loans.Uig News, February 2008"]}, {"page": "David I of Scotland", "response": ["David's brother King Edgar had visited William Rufus in May 1099 and bequeathed to David extensive territory to the south of the river Forth.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 59\u201360. On 8 January 1107, Edgar died. His younger brother Alexander took the throne. It has been assumed that David took control of his inheritance \u2013 the southern lands bequeathed by Edgar \u2013 soon after the latter's death.Judith Green, \"David I and Henry I\", p. 3. She cites the gap in knowledge about David's whereabouts as evidence; for a brief outline of David's itinerary, see Barrow, The Charters of David I, pp. 38\u201341 However, it cannot be shown that he possessed his inheritance until his foundation of Selkirk Abbey late in 1113.See Oram, David, pp. 60\u20132; Duncan, The Kingship of the Scots, pp. 60\u20134. According to Richard Oram, it was only in 1113, when Henry returned to England from Normandy, that David was at last in a position to claim his inheritance in southern Scotland.For all this, see Oram, David, pp. 59\u201363.", "If \"divided from\" is anything to go by, this quatrain may have been written in David's new territories in southern Scotland.Clancy, \"A Gaelic Polemic Quatrain\", p. 88. The lands in question consisted of the pre-1975 counties of Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire, Berwickshire, Peeblesshire and Lanarkshire. David, moreover, gained the title , \"Prince of the Cumbrians\", as attested in David's charters from this era.For all this, see Oram, David, pp. 62\u201364; for Princeps Cumbrensis, see Archibald Lawrie, Early Scottish Charters Prior to A.D. 1153, (Glasgow, 1905), no. 46. Although this was a large slice of Scotland south of the river Forth, the region of Galloway-proper was entirely outside David's control.Richard Oram, The Lordship of Galloway, (Edinburgh, 2000), pp. 54\u201361; see also following references. David may perhaps have had varying degrees of overlordship in parts of Dumfriesshire, Ayrshire, Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire.See, for instance, Dauvit Broun, \"The Welsh Identity of the Kingdom of Strathclyde\", in The Innes Review, Vol. 55, no. 2 (Autumn, 2004), pp. 138\u201340, n. 117; see also Forte, Oram, & Pedersen, The Viking Empires, (Cambridge, 2005), pp. 96\u20137. In the lands between Galloway and the Principality of Cumbria, David eventually set up large-scale marcher lordships, such as Annandale for Robert de Brus, Cunningham for Hugh de Morville, and possibly Strathgryfe for Walter Fitzalan.E.g., Oram, David, p. 113, also n. 7.", "In spite of the fact that King David spent his childhood in Scotland, Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray David as having little initial connection with the culture and society of the Scots;Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 79; Oram, David, pp. 75\u20136. but both likewise argue that David became increasingly re-Gaelicised in the later stages of his reign.Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 83; Oram, David, esp. for instance, pp. 96, 126. Whatever the case, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. However, the Scots never followed the Norman laws of primogeniture. David was the youngest of eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad II, and M\u00e1el Coluim, son of the last king Alexander, but since Scots had never adopted the rules of  primogeniture that was not a barrier to his kingship, and unlike David, neither William nor M\u00e1el Coluim had the support of Henry. So when Alexander died in 1124, the aristocracy of Scotland could either accept David as king, or face war with both David and Henry I.Oram, David, pp. 70\u20132.", "Outside his Cumbrian principality and the southern fringe of Scotland-proper, David exercised little power in the 1120s, and in the words of Richard Oram, was \"king of Scots in little more than name\".Oram, David, p. 87. He was probably in that part of Scotland he did rule for most of the time between late 1127 and 1130.Oram, David, p. 83. However, he was at the court of Henry in 1126 and in early 1127,A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 163\u20133. and returned to Henry's court in 1130, serving as a judge at Woodstock for the treason trial of Geoffrey de Clinton. It was in this year that David's wife, Matilda of Huntingdon, died. Possibly as a result of this,Oram, David, p. 84. and while David was still in southern England,A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 167. Scotland-proper rose up in arms against him.", "Richard Oram puts forward the suggestion that it was during this period that David granted Walter fitz Alan Strathgryfe, with northern Kyle and the area around Renfrew, forming what would become the \"Stewart\" lordship of Strathgryfe; he also suggests that Hugh de Morville may have gained Cunningham and the settlement of \"Strathyrewen\" (i.e. Irvine). This would indicate that the 1130\u201334 campaign had resulted in the acquisition of these territories.For all this, see Oram, David, pp. 93\u20136.", "While fighting King Stephen and attempting to dominate northern England in the years following 1136, David was continuing his drive for control of the far north of Scotland. In 1139, his cousin, the five-year-old Harald Maddadsson, was given the title of \"Earl\" and half the lands of the earldom of Orkney, in addition to Scottish Caithness. Throughout the 1140s Caithness and Sutherland were brought back under the Scottish zone of control.Richard Oram, \"David I and the Conquest of Moray\", p. 11. Sometime before 1146 David appointed a native Scot called Aindr\u00e9as to be the first Bishop of Caithness, a bishopric which was based at Halkirk, near Thurso, in an area which was ethnically Scandinavian.John Dowden, The Bishops of Scotland, ed. J. Maitland Thomson, (Glasgow, 1912), p. 232; Kenneth Jackson, The Gaelic Notes in the Book of Deer: The Osborn Bergin Memorial Lecture 1970, (Cambridge, 1972), p. 80.", "David also attempted to interfere in the succession to the archbishopric of York. William FitzHerbert, nephew of King Stephen, found his position undermined by the collapsing political fortune of Stephen in the north of England, and was deposed by the Pope. David used his Cistercian connections to build a bond with Henry Murdac, the new archbishop. Despite the support of Pope Eugenius III, supporters of King Stephen and William FitzHerbert managed to prevent Henry taking up his post at York. In 1149, Henry had sought the support of David. David seized on the opportunity to bring the archdiocese under his control, and marched on the city. However, Stephen's supporters became aware of David's intentions, and informed King Stephen. Stephen therefore marched to the city and installed a new garrison. David decided not to risk such an engagement and withdrew.For David's struggle for control over York, see pp. 186\u20139. Richard Oram has conjectured that David's ultimate aim was to bring the whole of the ancient kingdom of Northumbria into his dominion. For Oram, this event was the turning point, \"the chance to radically redraw the political map of the British Isles lost forever\".Oram, David, p. 189.", "In the 1980s, Barrow sought a compromise between change and continuity, and argued that the reign of King David was in fact a \"Balance of New and Old\".Barrow, \"The Balance of New and Old\", passim. Such a conclusion was a natural incorporation of an underlying current in Scottish historiography which, since William F. Skene's monumental and revolutionary three-volume Celtic Scotland: A History of Ancient Alban (1876\u201380), had been forced to acknowledge that \"Celtic Scotland\" was alive and healthy for a long time after the reign of David I.William Forbes Skene, Celtic Scotland: A History of Ancient Alban, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, 1876\u201380); see also, Edward J. Cowan, \"The Invention of Celtic Scotland\", pp. 1\u201323. Michael Lynch followed and built upon Barrow's compromise solution, arguing that as David's reign progressed, his kingship became more Celtic.Lynch, Scotland: A New History, pp. 82\u201383. Despite its subtitle, in 2004 in the only full volume study of David I's reign yet produced, David I: The King Who Made Scotland, its author Richard Oram further builds upon Lynch's picture, stressing continuity while placing the changes of David's reign in their context.Oram, David I, (Stroud, 2004).", "David was a great town builder. As Prince of the Cumbrians, David founded the first two burghs of \"Scotland\", at Roxburgh and Berwick.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, p. 465. Burghs were settlements with defined boundaries and guaranteed trading rights, locations where the king could collect and sell the products of his cain and conveth (a payment made in lieu of providing the king hospitality).See G.W.S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity, pp. 84\u2013104; see also, Stringer, \"The Emergence of a Nation-State\", pp. 66\u20139. David founded around 15 burghs.Stringer, \"The Emergence of a Nation-State\", p. 67. Numbering is uncertain; Perth may date to the reign of Alexander I; Inverness is a case were the foundation may date later, but may date to the period of David I: see for instance the blanket statement that Inverness dates to David I's reign in Derek Hall, Burgess, Merchant and Priest, compare Richard Oram, David, p. 93, where it is acknowledged that this is merely a possibility, to A.A.M. Duncan, The Making of the Kingdom, p. 480, who quotes a charter indicating that the burgh dates to the reign of William the Lion."]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Richard Oram"]}, {"page": "Magnus Barefoot", "response": ["In Scotland internal fighting continued between rival kings, although King Edgar had gained a slight advantage. Perhaps fearing to meet Magnus in battle after the internecine strife, according to the sagas Edgar\u2014mistakenly called Malcolm\u2014told Magnus he would renounce all Scottish claims to islands west of Scotland in exchange for peace. Magnus accepted the offer, which reportedly gave him every island a ship could reach with its rudder set. He gained recognition of his rule in the Southern Isles, including Kintyre after demonstrating that it should be included by sitting at the rudder of his ship as it was dragged across the narrow isthmus at Tarbert.F\u00f8rsund (2012) pp. 70\u201372W\u00e6rdahl (2011) p. 43Power (1986) p. 121 Historian Richard Oram has claimed that references to a formal agreement with the Scottish king is a \"post-Norwegian civil war confection\" designed to legitimise the agenda of Haakon IV Haakonsson.Oram (2011) pp. 49\u201350 Rosemary Power agrees with the Norse sources that a formal agreement with the Scots was probably concluded, and Se\u00e1n Duffy notes that Edgar \"happily ceded\" the isles to Magnus since he had \"little or no authority there in any case\". Magnus spent the winter in the Hebrides (continuing to fortify the islands), while many of his men returned to Norway. There may have been talks at this time of Magnus marrying Matilda, daughter of late Scottish king Malcolm Canmore, but no marriage took place.Power (1986) pp. 121\u2013122 Magnus returned to Norway a year later during the summer of 1099, although many of the islands he had conquered (such as Anglesey) were only nominally under Norwegian control.F\u00f8rsund (2012) p. 73"]}, {"page": "Waltheof of Melrose", "response": ["Following the death of Waltheof, his successor as Abbot of Melrose, Abbot William, refused to encourage the rumours that were now spreading regarding Waltheof's saintliness.
