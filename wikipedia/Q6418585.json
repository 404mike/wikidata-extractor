She immigrated to London in 1886 when she was fifteen, and she grew to minor prominence when she sang in music halls throughout the United Kingdom during the late 19th century. She became known in the field for standing up for female performers against agents, corruption, and for better working conditions. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1908, engaged in selling their newspaper Votes for Women and became a prominent suffragette in the United Kingdom for her participation in civil unrest protests including riots and arson. As a result, Marion was arrested many times and is known for having endured 232 force-feedings while on hunger strike in prison. She is quoted as saying \u201cthere are no words to describe the horrible revolting sensation.\u201d When World War I started she emigrated to the United States, and there she joined the team on Margaret Sanger\u2019s Birth Control Review. Although she used her tenacity and loud voice to get people to pay attention to her cause, she did not use violence as much as she had in the United Kingdom, although she was still arrested many times for advocating birth control.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1944", "response": ["** Kitty Marion, German-born actress and women's rights activist in England and the United States (b. 1871)"]}, {"page": "1871", "response": ["* March 12 \u2013 Kitty Marion, German-born actress and women's rights activist in England and the United States (d. 1944)"]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1800\u20131874||data-sort-value=\"Marion, Kitty\"|Kitty Marion||United Kingdom||1871||1944||Socialist feminist; suffragette ||"]}, {"page": "Women's Social and Political Union", "response": ["Fern Riddell in her book \u201cDeath in Ten Minutes: The forgotten life of radical suffragette Kitty Marion\u201d stated that they were \u2018the most dangerous suffragettes of all\u2019", "On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Christabel Pankhurst was living in Paris, in order to run the organisation without fear of arrest.
