One account attributes the song to a \"Negro spirit\" heard at Canterbury, New Hampshire, which would make the song a \"gift song\" received by a Shaker from the spirit world. Alternatively, and far more widely accepted, the song's composer is said to be Brackett. The song, written in 1848, was largely unknown outside of Shaker communities until Aaron Copland used the melody in his 1944 composition Appalachian Spring.

Ashley - known in those days as \"Tyger\" - became a regular guest in the Peggs' Leeds flat, which they shared with their young daughter Clancy. By this time Bob was researching the folk music of the Yorkshire Dales in the University's Institute of Dialect and Folk Life Studies, and Ashley/Tyger was captivated by the tape recordings of hardcore English traditional music that he heard in the Pegg household. The friendship continued in 1969, after the Peggs moved from Leeds to Stevenage, where Bob took up a post as lecturer in English at the College of Further Education. After a devastating road accident in which two people connected with Fairport Convention died, Ashley Hutchings left the band and went to live with the Peggs. By this time the Bob and Carole were well known nationally on the folk music scene as traditional performers, but they were interested in folk rock and had begun to write their own material. They discussed forming a band with Ashley, but, after a couple of unproductive rehearsals, he formed a new group, Steeleye Span, whose initial members included Tim Hart and Maddy Prior, Terry Woods, of the Irish band Sweeney's Men, and his wife Gay. During 1969 the Peggs had been making an LP for record producer Bill Leader, who encouraged them to write and record their own material (these recordings were released in 1971 as He Came From the Mountains). Some of the tracks, including a version of Sydney Carter's Lord of the Dance, used an instrumental line-up of fiddle, melodeon, cello, bass and drums, which was inspired by the old village bands of the Yorkshire Dales. This would become the hallmark of the Mr Fox band. Bill Leader played the tapes for Nat Joseph of Transatlantic Records, who signed the Peggs up, despite his having had a previous contractual disagreement with them in the aftermath of 1965's The Second Wave. For their first album they recruited Alan Eden (drums), Barry Lyons (bass), Andrew Massey (cello) and John Myatt (clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon) and adopted the name Mr Fox, which was also the title of their signature song, based on a bloody English folk tale - a version of the Bluebeard legend - in which a young woman outwits a serial killer.", "Carole (as Carolanne Pegg) recorded an eponymous solo album in 1973, and briefly formed the band Magus with jazz R & B maestro Graham Bond before moving on to become a respected ethnomusicologist.
