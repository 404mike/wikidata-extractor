Following retirement from competitive sport he continued to be involved in strength athletics as a referee, event promoter and coach. He also ran a sportswear retail shop, and became renowned as a world-class breeder of birds. Capes stood 197 cm (6 ft 5+1\u20442 in) and weighed 170 kilograms (370 lb) at his peak condition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Geoff Capes (born 1949), shotputter"]}, {"page": "Chesterfield, Derbyshire", "response": ["*Geoff Capes (born 1949), twice winner of the World's Strongest Man competition, used to live in Chesterfield."]}, {"page": "J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson", "response": ["J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll was invited to the World's Strongest Man competition for the first time in 1983, in which he came in second only to Geoff Capes. The following year, at age 24, he defeated Capes and secured the title. During the final armwrestling event, in which J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll was up against him, Capes appeared to be winning, pulling J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll's arm down convincingly, but sustained a muscle tear in his forearm as J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll started to thrust his arm back. Right after winning the bout, J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll shouted \"The King has lost his crown!\" and won his first World's Strongest Man title in 1984. Although J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll was closely defeated by Capes at the 1985 World's Strongest Man, he managed to regain the title in 1986. During the deadlift event at the 1985 World's Strongest Man competition, someone in the audience called him an Eskimo. J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll shouted back: \"I am not an Eskimo. I am a Viking!\" and successfully lifted the  cart.", "At Pure Strength 1987, a competition held in place of the absent World's Strongest Man competition of that year on the grounds of Huntly Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Geoff Capes, Bill Kazmaier and J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll matched up to crown the strongest man on the planet. J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll, being in the shape of his life, won the contest convincingly by winning 8 out of 10 events and even managed to beat Kazmaier, who was making his comeback into the strongman sport after having worked and travelled as a professional wrestler. A famous quote, \"There is no reason to be alive if you can't do deadlift.\" was shouted by J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll when he won the deadlift event at this contest with a strongman world record lift of  off a rectangular handled bar from knee height.", "J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll was described in his life documentary \"Larger than Life\" by one of his former rivals Geoff Capes as \"a new kind of guy on the block\" and by David Webster equally in describing him as a man who boasted pure static strength as well as versatile athletic strength in all its forms, a combination that lead to his supreme performances."]}, {"page": "Bargain Hunt", "response": ["| Henry Cooper and Geoff Capes"]}, {"page": "World's Strongest Man", "response": ["After Kazmaier left, his nearest rival, former Olympian Geoff Capes from the UK, traded wins with the Icelandic powerlifter J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson, with Capes winning in 1983 and 1985, and Sigmarsson in 1984 and 1986. Sigmarsson raised the popularity and awareness of the event to new levels. He died three years after winning his 4th and final WSM in 1990. In 1987, Sigmarsson would defeat Capes and Kazmaier in Pure Strength. Kazmaier returned to WSM in 1988, but could not dethrone Sigmarsson, who won his 3rd title. The only other man to claim the title in this era was Jamie Reeves, which he did in 1989. Reeves was injured in 1990, as Sigmarsson narrowly claimed his 4th title ahead of O.D. Wilson, who was leading by 5.5 points going into the final event, a controversial 200m race with 100\u00a0kg on the back.

In addition to powerlifting he had become actively involved in strength athletics and in 1986 won the National Truck Pulling Championships (sponsored by ASA/Bristol Street Motors) and came second to Peter Tregloan in 1986 in the Midland's Strongest Man competition. In 1987 he improved on his second-place finish by winning the Midland's Strongest Man (the first of three consecutive wins). That year he also won the first of three consecutive Yorkshire's Strongest Man competitions and won the England's Strongest Man competition also.
