Rush Rehm argues that these inaugurated the \"agricultural cycle of planting and harvesting\" closely associated with Dionysus, who represented the embodiment of \"a fundamental paradox inherent to the world, life-giving but potentially destructive.\"Rehm (1992, 12\u201313) The role of the satyr play within the Festival of Dionysus is often not noted to be as important as the tragedies presented at the festival; however, it is crucial to the dramatic arts and history not to downplay their importance. The dramatic festivities at the City Dionysia in Athens, similarly dedicated to Dionysus, required each competing tragedian to submit three tragedies and a satyr play, which functioned as the last piece performed at the festival.Rehm (1992, 39) and Lancelyn Green (1957, 11) The accurate emergence of the satyr play is debatable; however, Brockett argues that most evidence \u201ccredits Pratinas with having invented this form sometime before 501 BC\u201d,Brockett (1999, 17) which is supported by P. E. Easterling\u2019s argument that by the 5th century the satyr play was considered an integral component of the tragike didaskalia.Easterling (1997, 40) Brockett also suggests the possibility that the satyr play was the first form of drama from which both tragedy and comedy gradually emerged."]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*P.
