Maguire previously worked with producer Simpson on CFF film Kadoyng (1972), \"demonstrating the Foundation's preference for familiar faces\".Shail 2016, p. 77. Ian Millsted of Infinity magazine notes that CFF screenplays of the 1970s\u2014including Professor Popper's Problem\u2014remedied critiques of its features of the 1950s and 60s, which suggested \"that they seemed to be set on an alien world where all the children spoke the Queen\u2019s English [...], behaved with impeccable morals and were routinely smarter than any adult\". According to Millsted, this was achieved by deploying \"noticeably more regional accents and working class characters\", relegating science-fiction elements to jovial plot points rather than intrinsic storylines. Notwithstanding, \"gadgets and gimmicks became the order of the day\".Millsted 2017, p. 65. In this Professor Popper's Problem was typical, using special effects by Tom Howard and deliberately oversized props on a \"very small budget\" of \u00a3250,000. O'Hara remarked that many props were borrowed since \"nobody minded really as it was a CFF film\", also praising Howard, \"who was really talented at making the money go a long way\".
