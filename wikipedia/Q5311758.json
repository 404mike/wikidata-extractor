SAG Awards. Retrieved 27 February 2009. In 1999, he appeared as the paramilitary \"Mad Dog\" Billy Wilson in The Most Fertile Man in Ireland (Dudi Appleton). The following year, he appeared in Declan Lowney's feature debut, Wild About Harry. Lowney had personally asked him to appear in the supporting role of cross-dressing Unionist politician Walter Adair. In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in Peter Cattaneo's Lucky Break. He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, \"Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research I could have done but we did spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives. I didn't interview any of the inmates because I thought it would be a little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because we were going home every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels.\" The film was a total flop, despite receiving positive feedback from test audiences in the United States."]}, {"page": "Halloween (2007 film)", "response": ["Akkad continued to try to develop a sequel. Josh Stolberg, who also unsuccessfully proposed a Hellraiser crossover with Bobby Florsheim, pitched Halloween: Bad Blood, which would have brought back Jamie Lloyd. A 2004 script from screenwriting duo Jim Keeble and Dudi Appleton, titled Halloween: Retribution, would have begun with Michael killing Busta Rhymes's character Freddie Harris and involved Laurie Strode's son John Tate and Sheriff Leigh Brackett plotting to kill Michael Myers in revenge for her death in the previous film; the film would have ended with Tate drowning Michael in a frozen lake but implying that he would take his place as a murderous killer. Also in 2004, a script from Mirrors 2 scribe Matt Veene, entitled Halloween: Asylum, had Michael Myers breaking free from death row. Another prospective screenplay written by Jake Wade Wall was Halloween: The Missing Years, which would have been a prequel centered around Michael Myers returning to Smith's Grove Sanitarium in the early 1980s during the events of Halloween III: Season of the Witch, with flashbacks revealing details about his childhood at the asylum after murdering his sister in the 1960s. At the same time Moustapha Akkad and his son Malek were working on a story revolving around Dr. Wynn from Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Development on a direct sequel suddenly halted when Moustapha Akkad was killed in the 2005 Amman hotel bombings while attending a wedding in Jordan, and his son Malek decided to take the series in a different direction."]}, {"page": "Rockport School", "response": ["* Dudi Appleton, journalist and film director"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British journalists", "response": ["Dudi Appletonnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "1969 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Dudi Appleton, journalist, scriptwriter and film director."]}, {"page": "2000 Toronto International Film Festival", "response": ["* The Most Fertile Man in Ireland by Dudi Appleton"]}, {"page": "Dudi", "response": ["*Dudi Appleton, American journalist"]}, {"page": "The Most Fertile Man in Ireland", "response": ["The Most Fertile Man in Ireland is a 2000 Irish comedy film directed by Dudi Appleton and starring Bronagh Gallagher, Kris Marshall and James Nesbitt."]}]}}
