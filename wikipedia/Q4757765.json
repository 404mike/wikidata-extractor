He resigned from these positions in the wake of his appearance at the Cole Inquiry. Despite \"the trial by media\" that occurred throughout the inquiry, in November 2006, he was exonerated. But this revelation came too late, as the reputation of Lindberg, AWB and many other parties involved, had already been tainted. Despite being cleared by the Cole Inquiry, Andrew was pursued by ASIC. The Judge in charge of the case has criticised ASIC for its conduct in relation to their charges against Lindberg and the long protracted proceedings. Lindberg was eventually fined and banned from managing a company for one year for his role in the scandal.Prior to that, he had been Chief Executive of WorkCover in Victoria and worked for the Victorian Accident Compensation Commission since 1987.\nAfter completing his Bachelor of Science at University of Melbourne, he had first worked as an industrial relations advisor in the mining and food production industries.\nHe migrated from Scotland to Australia with his family at age six.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oil-for-Food Programme", "response": ["The Cole Inquiry has received testimony from senior Australian Government officials, including Prime Minister John Howard, Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and various officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

This decision came after Paul Hastings QC declared the prospect of convictions was limited and \"not in the public interest\". The Australian Securities & Investments Commission then proceeded with several civil cases against six former directors and officers of AWB. Two have been against Andrew Lindberg, AWB's former head. Both are still in progress. Another civil case was brought by shareholders of AWB, and was settled out of court for $39.5 million in February 2010.", "Australia's government has distanced itself from the payments to Saddam Hussein's regime, given Australia's contribution to military action against Hussein in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

ASIC decided to discontinue the proceedings after forming the view that it was no longer in the public interest to pursue its claims. Eventually the most serious of ASIC's charges against Trevor Flugge, the former Chairman of AWB, and Peter Geary, the former Group General Manager Trading of AWB, were dismissed. Flugge was later fined $50,000 and banned from managing a company for 5 years, for failing to inquire about AWB's payments to the Iraqi regime. AWB's managing director at the time, Andrew Lindberg, and CFO Paul Ingleby were fined $100,000 and $40,000 and banned from manager roles for 2 years and 15 months, respectively."]}, {"page": "List of Australian businesspeople", "response": ["* Andrew Lindberg"]}, {"page": "Lindberg, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Lindberg"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Australian Institute of Company Directors", "response": ["* Andrew Lindberg (born 1954)"]}]}}
