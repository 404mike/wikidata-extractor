He held the British welterweight title in 2006, challenged once for the Commonwealth welterweight title in 2006 and once for the British and EBU European super lightweight titles in 2007.\nWoodley was involved with gangs in his younger years, which led to him serving a prison sentence for assault. After being released from prison, Woodley took up boxing. His breakthrough came on 28 January 2006 when he beat Michael Jennings the reigning British Welterweight champion in a split decision at Nottingham Arena to claim his first British Championship.\nWoodley obtained his nickname from his father, who was said to laugh like Muttley from the cartoon series Wacky Races. He uses his nickname as his name when boxing and has also won the Midlands Area and English light-welterweight titles in his career.\nHe lost his British title in an up-and-down classic with Commonwealth champion Kevin Anderson at the Aston Villa Events Centre on 1 June 2006.
