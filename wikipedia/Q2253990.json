Her victory in singles against high-ranking British player Ruth Winch was regarded as a huge surprise by the tennis community. However, Lenglen still struggled at larger tournaments early in the year, losing to Ryan in the quarterfinals at Monte Carlo and six-time Wimbledon champion Dorothea Lambert Chambers in the semifinals at the South of France Championships. In May, Lenglen was invited to enter the French Championships, which was restricted to French players. The format gave the defending champion a bye until the final match, known as the challenge round. In that match, they faced the winner of the All Comers' competition, a standard tournament bracket for the remaining players. Lenglen won the All Comers' singles draw of six players to make it to the challenge round against Marguerite Broquedis. Despite winning the first set, she lost the match. This was the last time in Lenglen's career she lost a completed singles match, and the only time she lost a singles final other than by default. Although she also lost the doubles challenge round at the tournament to Blanche and Suzanne Amblard, Lenglen won the mixed doubles title with Max Decugis as her partner."]}, {"page": "Tennis at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's outdoor singles", "response": ["The women's singles (outdoor) was one of six lawn tennis events on the Tennis at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. The number of withdrawals resulted in empty brackets, with one player making it to the final without playing a single match while another had to win two to advance to that point. Nations could enter up to 12 players.Official Report, p. 35. In all, 13 women from 4 nations were entered but only 5 from Great Britain competed. The tournament was held from 7 to 11 July at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. It was won by Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers, with Dora Boothby taking silver and Ruth Winch bronze (the latter two without having won a set)."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|bgcolor=cc9966| 3rd ||align=left| Ruth Winch || Bye || Bye || Lost to Chambers ||bgcolor=lightgray| Did not advance"]}, {"page": "Ruth Joan Winch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ruth Winch"]}, {"page": "Winch (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Ruth Winch (1870\u20131952), a British tennis player"]}, {"page": "Suzanne Lenglen career statistics", "response": ["| Ruth Winch"]}, {"page": "Ruth Legh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ruth Winch"]}]}}
