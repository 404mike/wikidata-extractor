They could have won an eighth trophy, but failed to win the Irish Intermediate Cup.  They had finished level on points with Portadown in the league, but beat Portadown 3\u20131 in a play-off match to claim the title. Forward Bobby Braithwaite later recalled that \"Isaac McDowell kept us focused on each game and I recall that it was only after Portadown drew with the Glens [Glentoran] to set up a play-off match for the title that we realised what we could possibly achieve\". They won the County Antrim Shield by beating Glentoran 5\u20130 in the final. McDowell went on to manage Glentoran from 1962 to 1964. In December 2006, the Belfast Telegraph reported that he died in South Africa \"a few years ago\"."]}]}}
