Sackville-West denied that Jekyll's work had an impact on her own designs, but Nigel Nicolson described Lutyens' influence as \"pervasive\". Fleming and Gore go further, suggesting that the use of groupings of colours \"followed Jekyll\"; \"a purple border, a cottage garden in red, orange and yellow, a walled garden pink [and] purple, a white garden, a herb garden\". Scott-James notes however that herbaceous borders, \"Jekyll's speciality\", were much disliked by Sackville-West. Other influencers and friends were the noted plantswoman Norah Lindsay, the plant collector Collingwood Ingram, who was their neighbour at Benenden, and Reginald Cooper, one of Nicolson's closest friends, whose earlier garden at Cothay Manor in Somerset has been described as the \"Sissinghurst of the West Country\". Sackville-West's considerable knowledge of old roses was deepened by her friendship with Edward Bunyard, plantsman, epicure, and the author of Old Garden Roses, who was a frequent visitor. The historian Peter Davey places the garden at the very end of a tradition of Arts and Crafts gardening which by the 1930s, in the face of changes in \"taste and economics\", had almost come to its close."]}, {"page": "Japan\u2013United Kingdom relations", "response": ["*Collingwood Ingram - known as \"Cherry Ingram\", a specialist cherry tree collector"]}, {"page": "Prunus serrulata", "response": ["::Great White Cherry.

The brown snakes were moved to the genus Pseudonaja by Australian naturalist Eric Worrell in the early 1960s on the basis of skull morphology, and reinforced by American herpetologist Samuel Booker McDowell in 1967 on the basis of the muscles of the venom glands. This classification has been followed by subsequent authors. Genetic analysis indicates that Ingram's brown snake is a diverged from the ancestor of all other brown snakes except the more basal ringed brown snake (P. modesta) and speckled brown snake (P. guttata)."]}, {"page": "Prunus \u00d7 incam", "response": ["Prunus \u00d7 incam was developed by Collingwood Ingram before 1942 by pollinating Prunus incisa with pollen from Prunus campanulata.

In addition to having a longer flowering period than most cherries, their inflorescences retain their red sepals and hypanthia for one or two weeks after the deeply emarginate petals have fallen, increasing their ornamental value. A number of cultivars are commercially available."]}]}}
