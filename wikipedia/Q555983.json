He had joined the band three years prior and recorded three successful albums with them. After leaving Deep Purple, Coverdale released his solo album White Snake in May 1977. His second solo album Northwinds was released in March 1978. Both combined elements of blues, soul and funk, as Coverdale had wanted to distance himself from the hard rock sound synonymous with Deep Purple. Both records featured former Snafu guitarist Micky Moody, whom Coverdale had known since the late 1960s. As Coverdale began assembling a backing band in London, Moody was the first to join. Among the other early candidates for the group were drummers Dave Holland and Cozy Powell, as well as guitarist Mel Galley. The decision to recruit a second guitarist was made at Moody's suggestion. Bernie Marsden, formerly of UFO and Paice Ashton Lord, agreed to join. Through Marsden, they were also able to recruit bassist Neil Murray, as the two had played together in Cozy Powell's Hammer. The band's initial line-up was rounded out by drummer Dave \"Duck\" Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnson, who had played together in Streetwalkers."]}, {"page": "Judas Priest", "response": ["The band's membership has seen much turnover, including a revolving cast of drummers in the 1970s and the departure of singer Rob Halford in 1992.

The current line-up consists of Halford, guitarists Glenn Tipton and Richie Faulkner, bassist Ian Hill and drummer Scott Travis. The band's best-selling album is 1982's Screaming for Vengeance, with their most commercially successful line-up featuring Hill, Halford, Tipton, guitarist K. K. Downing, and drummer Dave Holland.

The band recorded three tracks with pop producers Stock-Aitken-Waterman: two originals, \"Runaround\" and \"I Will Return\", and a cover of The Stylistics' hit \"You Are Everything\"; however, they were ultimately not included on this album due to a management decision. A reviewer has called Ram It Down a \"stylistic evolution\" that resulted from the band's \"attempt to rid themselves of the tech synthesiser approach\u00a0... and return to the traditional metal of their fading glory days\". The reviewer argued the album showed \"how far behind they were lagging\u00a0... the thrashers they helped influence\" in earlier years.
