They have been described at their outset as \"a bridge between punk and classic progressive rock\". Guitarist Steve Rothery wrote most of the music during the period Fish was in the band. Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers commented, \"What I love so much about Marillion is that they could be very strong and powerful and have very quiet passages, but the powerful stuff was really edgy and heavy... I just thought he (Fish) wrote good lyrics, and they wrote good music, and it fit together effortlessly.\""]}, {"page": "Iron Maiden", "response": ["During another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold. Vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990, followed by a tour. At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, The First Ten Years, a series of ten CDs and double 12-inch singles. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides. Band also released the career spanning video compilation entitled The First Ten Years: The Videos in 1992 re-issued as From There to Eternity. The 1980s were closed by the group with over 25 million albums sold, of which 10 million in the US, over five million videos were sold only in the US, which gave Iron Maiden six of 120 Gold and Platinum certificates received worldwide. All those achievements sealed the group's status as the largest representative of the heavy metal genre. Musicians set new records in the UK: six Top 5 singles in the Top 5, 10 double maxi-singles in the Top 10, the highest position ever for a debut single from a rock band, the most albums in the Top 10 for a British performer, excluding The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and Queen, 20 singles consecutively released on the charts.", "Soon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \"stripped down\" style that they were leaning towards. Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years. The album, No Prayer for the Dying, was released in October 1990. It contained hit singles as \"Holy Smoke\" and \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", the band's first (and to date, only) UK Singles Chart No.\u00a01, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown. In 1990 Bruce Dickinson received the Golden Raspberry Awards in category The Worst Original Song for the band's most successful single in Great Britain. The album debuted at No.\u00a02 in the UK albums chart and No.\u00a017 on the Billboard 200. No Prayer for the Dying signalled the return of Iron Maiden to the roots of theirs musical style, in particular in its simplicity of composition and raw sound.", "Bayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting. The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour, although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.", "Steve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter, has stated that his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Queen, Heart and Wishbone Ash. In 2010 Harris stated, \"I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\" In 2004, Harris explained that the band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\" On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar,\" cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills.\"", "The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style. Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which, he claims, \"evolved naturally. I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\" Stating that he \"was inspired by blues rock rather than metal,\" Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a \"melodic player.\" Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, which he claims is in contrast to Smith's \"rhythmic\" sound.", "* Janick Gers \u2013 guitars (1990\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "1989 in music", "response": ["* Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith leaves the band and is replaced by ex-Gillan guitarist Janick Gers who had most recently worked with Bruce Dickinson on his solo project."]}, {"page": "1957 in music", "response": ["* January 27 \u2013 Janick Gers, heavy metal guitarist (Iron Maiden)"]}, {"page": "The Seventh Seal", "response": ["The film is referred to in several songs.

Iron Maiden's eighth studio release, 1990's No Prayer for the Dying, had a raw sound that, according to AllMusic, did not \"hold up well\" compared to past efforts, as it was recorded in a barn which Steve Harris owned, with a mobile studio owned by the Rolling Stones. The record featured Dickinson's \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", originally composed for a film soundtrack, which despite receiving a Golden Raspberry Award for worst original song in 1989, became the band's first and only single to top the UK Singles Chart. By 1992, Harris had converted his barn into a proper studio, and the new album, Fear of the Dark, was recorded there, resulting in a better overall sound than No Prayer for the Dying, although Dickinson still claims it had limitations due to its size.", "Along with Adrian Smith, Dickinson rejoined Iron Maiden in 1999 with Janick Gers remaining in the band, after he was approached by manager Rod Smallwood. Smallwood also spoke to Steve Harris about Dickinson's return, who initially had reservations about the prospect, but soon came round to the idea, deliberating that they knew of his abilities and that it was a case of \"better the devil you know\". Harris and Dickinson agreed to meet at Smallwood's home in Brighton in January 1999 for the first conversation they would have with each other since 1993. Although both men were nervous about the encounter, upon seeing each other the tension immediately dissipated and both agreed that Dickinson should return to the group.", "In early 1989, Zomba asked Dickinson to produce a track for the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, providing a budget, a studio, and a producer, Chris Tsangarides. Dickinson took up the opportunity and called an old friend of his, former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, and, shortly after meeting up, they had \"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\" ready for the studio, then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr, and drummer Fabio del Rio. \"I wrote it in about three minutes\", states Dickinson, \"I don't know where the title 'Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter' came from, but it just popped into my head. I thought, 'Bloody hell, straight out of AC/DC!' And I thought, 'Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah, that'll do.' Impressed with the results, Zomba asked Dickinson if he was willing to record a whole album as well. With the same line-up and producer, Dickinson's solo debut, Tattooed Millionaire, was written and recorded within two weeks, and released in May 1990, followed by a supporting tour."]}, {"page": "Steve Harris (musician)", "response": ["Harris is often considered among the best and most influential heavy metal bassists. He is most known for his \"galloping\" playing style: usually an eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes at fast tempo (e.g., \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills\") or eighth note triplets, which he plays with two fingers, rather than using a plectrum. Before playing, Harris often chalks his fingers, to make these fast patterns easier to play, as shown on the bonus DVD for the A Matter of Life and Death album. Harris's playing is often unusually prominent in the mix on Iron Maiden's recordings; he generally uses a tone with a treble-heavy EQ and compression to accentuate the attack on the strings. Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers has commented that \"Steve taught himself in a way that nobody can really copy it. People say it's like a lead guitar, but it's not. It gives the band a basis and it moves around quite a lot, but it's the tone that he has. Steve has a way of hearing things and a tone that isn't normally associated with a bass, it's more like a rhythm guitar.\""]}, {"page": "Visions of the Beast", "response": ["*Janick Gers\u00a0\u2013 guitar (Disc one; tracks 15, 16, 19 and 21, Disc two; tracks 1 to 16)"]}, {"page": "Dance of Death (album)", "response": ["According to guitarist Janick Gers, the album's title track was inspired by the final scene of Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, at the end of which \"these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death\".
