He later signed for Chelmsford City in September 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Craig Bryson", "response": ["During the 2008\u201309 season, Bryson established himself as an important first team player, making thirty-three league appearances, thirty-one of them starts. His first goal of the season came in a Scottish League Cup second round match against Brechin City on 27 August 2008. Described variously as \"stunning\", \"unstoppable\", \"sublime\" and \"a thunderbolt\", he scored the second in a 2\u20130 win when he received a cross from Garry Hay and flicked the ball into the top corner. His next two goals were late winners in successive matches: on 4 October in a 2\u20131 win at Hearts he made a well-timed run into the box in the 82nd minute to collect a return pass from Donovan Simmonds and finish well into the bottom corner; and then on 18 October he scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win at home to Motherwell, slipping the ball into the net at the far post in the 89th minute after a deflected shot-cum-cross from Jamie Hamill. Manager Jim Jefferies praised Bryson after the win over Hearts, saying his late run into the box and finish was comparable to a move by Colin Cameron. He was also named man of the match after the win over Motherwell."]}, {"page": "Donovan simmonds", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donovan Simmonds "]}, {"page": "Donovan (name)", "response": ["*Donovan Simmonds (born 1988), English football (soccer) player"]}, {"page": "Charlton Athletic F.C.
