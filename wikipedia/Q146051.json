She founded Kids with Cameras, a non-profit organization that teaches the art of photography to marginalized children in communities throughout the world. Her interest in photography began at age 10.After earning a master's degree at the University of Cambridge, she studied documentary photography at International Center of Photography in New York. In 1995, she made her first trip to India, producing a story on female infanticide. In 1997, Briski returned to India and began her project on the prostitutes of Calcutta's red-light district, which led to her work with the children of prostitutes.Her latest project Reverence is an experiential multimedia exhibit about transformation. Inspired by dreams of a praying mantis, she was led around the world to collaborate with living insects, taking their portraits in photographs and film. \"My work is a tribute to insects, to their intelligence, personality and elegant beauty,\" she says. The project raised initial funds through the crowdsourcing site Kickstarter in 2010.\nBriski has won numerous awards and fellowships including the Open Society Institute Fellowship, the Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship in 2000 to research and photograph in the Brothels of India, a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship, the Howard Chapnick Grant and 1st Prize in 1999 in the World Press Photo foundation competition in the category \"Daily Life stories\".

The filmmaker gave each child a camera and taught them photography so that they could begin to look at their world with a new set of eyes, unveiling hope and uncovering hidden talents from within themselves. As a result, many of them found the strength to break from their circumstances and begin charting out meaningful lives. Nayar launched the Bigshot project in 2006, and the first set of Bigshot cameras were produced for use in pilot workshops in 2009.
