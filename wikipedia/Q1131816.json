Darwin also wrote Economy of Vegetation, and together the two were published as The Botanic Garden. Among other writers he influenced were Anna Seward and Maria Jacson.", "Some women of Darwin's era were receiving more substantial education and participating in the broader world.  An example is Susanna Wright, who was raised in Lancashire and became an American colonist associated with the Midlands Enlightenment. It is not known whether Darwin and Wright knew each other, although they definitely knew many people in common.  Other women who received substantial education and who participated in the broader world (albeit sometimes anonymously) whom Darwin definitely knew were Maria Jacson and Anna Seward."]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Anna Seward (1742\u20131809, E)"]}, {"page": "Horace", "response": ["Horatian-style lyrics were increasingly typical of Oxford and Cambridge verse collections for this period, most of them in Latin but some like the previous ode in English. John Milton's Lycidas first appeared in such a collection. It has few Horatian echoesOne echo of Horace may be found in line 69: \"Were it not better done as others use,/ To sport with Amaryllis in the shade/Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?\", which points to the Neara in Odes 3.14.21 (Douglas Bush, Milton: Poetical Works, 144, note 69) yet Milton's associations with Horace were lifelong. He composed a controversial version of Odes 1.5, and Paradise Lost includes references to Horace's 'Roman' Odes 3.1\u20136 (Book 7 for example begins with echoes of Odes 3.4).J. Talbot, A Horatian Pun in Paradise Lost, 21\u20133 Yet Horace's lyrics could offer inspiration to libertines as well as moralists, and neo-Latin sometimes served as a kind of discrete veil for the risqu\u00e9. Thus for example Benjamin Loveling authored a catalogue of Drury Lane and Covent Garden prostitutes, in Sapphic stanzas, and an encomium for a dying lady \"of salacious memory\".B. Loveling, Latin and English Poems, 49\u201352, 79\u201383 Some Latin imitations of Horace were politically subversive, such as a marriage ode by Anthony Alsop that included a rallying cry for the Jacobite cause. On the other hand, Andrew Marvell took inspiration from Horace's Odes 1.37 to compose his English masterpiece Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland, in which subtly nuanced reflections on the execution of Charles I echo Horace's ambiguous response to the death of Cleopatra (Marvell's ode was suppressed in spite of its subtlety and only began to be widely published in 1776). Samuel Johnson took particular pleasure in reading The Odes.Cfr. James Boswell, \"The Life of Samuel Johnson\" Aetat. 20, 1729 where Boswell remarked of Johnson that Horace's Odes \"were the compositions in which he took most delight.\" Alexander Pope wrote direct Imitations of Horace (published with the original Latin alongside) and also echoed him in Essays and The Rape of the Lock. He even emerged as \"a quite Horatian Homer\" in his translation of the Iliad.D. Money, The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 329\u201331 Horace appealed also to female poets, such as Anna Seward (Original sonnets on various subjects, and odes paraphrased from Horace, 1799) and Elizabeth Tollet, who composed a Latin ode in Sapphic meter to celebrate her brother's return from overseas, with tea and coffee substituted for the wine of Horace's sympotic settings:"]}, {"page": "Lesbian", "response": ["One such relationship was between Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who wrote to Anne Wortley in 1709: \"Nobody was so entirely, so faithfully yours ... I put in your lovers, for I don't allow it possible for a man to be so sincere as I am.\"Faderman (1981), p. 119. Similarly, English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd, who was the subject of many of Seward's sonnets and poems. When Sneyd married despite Seward's protest, Seward's poems became angry. However, Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death, extolling Sneyd's beauty and their affection and friendship.Faderman (1981), pp. 132\u2013136. As a young woman, writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood. Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed, Wollstonecraft declared, \"The roses will bloom when there's peace in the breast, and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart:\u2014You know not how I love her.\"Faderman (1981), p. 139.", "Perhaps the most famous of these romantic friendships was between Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, nicknamed the Ladies of Llangollen. Butler and Ponsonby eloped in 1778, to the relief of Ponsonby's family (concerned about their reputation had she run away with a man)Faderman, p. 75. to live together in Wales for 51 years and be thought of as eccentrics.Aldrich, pp. 227\u2013229. Their story was considered \"the epitome of virtuous romantic friendship\" and inspired poetry by Anna Seward and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.Jennings, pp. 45\u201346. Diarist Anne Lister, captivated by Butler and Ponsonby, recorded her affairs with women between 1817 and 1840. Some of it was written in code, detailing her sexual relationships with Marianna Belcombe and Maria Barlow.Castle, p. 390. Both Lister and Eleanor Butler were considered masculine by contemporary news reports, and though there were suspicions that these relationships were sapphist in nature, they were nonetheless praised in literature.Aldrich, p. 233.Castle, pp. 339, 400."]}, {"page": "Walter Scott", "response": ["The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805), in medieval romance form, grew out of Scott's plan to include a long original poem of his own in the second edition of the Minstrelsy: it was to be \"a sort of Romance of Border Chivalry & inchantment\".The Letters of Sir Walter Scott: 1787\u20121807, ed. H. J. C. Grierson (London, 1932), 166 (Scott to Anna Seward, 30 November 1802). He owed the distinctive irregular accent in four-beat metre to Coleridge's Christabel, which he had heard recited by John Stoddart. (It was not to be published until 1816).Johnson, p. 197. Scott was able to draw on his unrivalled familiarity with Border history and legend acquired from oral and written sources beginning in his childhood to present an energetic and highly coloured picture of 16th-century Scotland, which both captivated the general public and with its voluminous notes also addressed itself to the antiquarian student. The poem has a strong moral theme, as human pride is placed in the context of the last judgment with the introduction of a version of the 'Dies irae' at the end. The work was an immediate success with almost all the reviewers and with readers in general, going through five editions in one year.
