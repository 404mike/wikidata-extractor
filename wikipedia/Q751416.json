She was the daughter of novelist Olivia Shakespear and the wife of American poet Ezra Pound.  One of a small number of women vorticist painters, her art work was published in BLAST, the short-lived but influential literary magazine.\nDorothy and Pound first met in 1909 in London, and after a long courtship the two married in 1914.  They lived in Paris from 1920 until 1924, and in 1925 settled in Rapallo, Italy.  In spite of her husband's 50-year affair with Olga Rudge, whom he met in Paris in the early 1920s,  Dorothy stayed married to Pound.  In 1926 she gave birth to a son Omar Pound, who was raised in England by her mother. By the 1930s she received a number of family bequests, making her financially independent, but lost much of her money by following Pound's advice to invest in Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime.\nToward the end of World War II, Dorothy and Pound were evacuated from their home in Rapallo, and for a period she lived with Pound in Rudge's home.  After the war, when Pound had been arrested for treason and incarcerated on grounds of insanity in Washington, D.C., she moved there, visiting daily,  taking control of his estate, and staying with him until his release.  They returned to Italy in 1958; in 1961 she moved to London, leaving her husband to live out the last decade of his life with Olga Rudge.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ezra Pound", "response": ["===Meeting Dorothy Shakespear, Personae===", "At the British Museum, Laurence Binyon introduced Pound to the East Asian artistic and literary concepts Pound used in his later poetry, including Japanese ukiyo-e prints.Arrowsmith (2011), 100, 106\u2013107; Qian (2000), 101 The visitors' book first shows Pound in the Prints and Drawings Students' Room (known as the Print Room)Arrowsmith (2011), 106\u2013107 on 9 February 1909, and later in 1912 and 1913, with Dorothy Shakespear, examining Chinese and Japanese art.Huang (2015), 108, note 4 Pound was working at the time on the poems that became Ripostes (1912), trying to move away from his earlier work.Witemeyer (1981), 112. \"I hadn't in 1910 made a language,\" he wrote years later. \"I don't mean a language to use, but even a language to think in.\"", "* Pound, Omar and Litz, A.

She grew up on a farm speaking the local dialect of German, but when she was older, she began to join her mother, and sometimes Pound, at Olga's house in Venice. There Mary was exposed to a world of culture, literature and politics. In the Tyrolean village, she had access to only two books, but when with her parents, she made full use of a large library, was expected to speak Italian, and wear white gloves. As a teenager, she moved away from the mountains and at that point, Pound took her education in hand.
