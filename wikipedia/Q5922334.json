On the death of the party's founder Screaming Lord Sutch in 1999, Hope and his pet cat, Catmando, were jointly elected as leaders of the OMRLP. Since June 2002 Hope has been the party's sole leader following Catmando's death in a road accident.\nHope was the first-ever OMRLP candidate to be elected to public office, when he was elected unopposed to a seat on Ashburton Town Council in Devon in 1987. He subsequently became the Mayor of Ashburton in 1998.In 2010 Hope was elected unopposed to Fleet Town Council in Hampshire.  Hope's longtime friendship with satirist Jacob Appel formed the basis for the latter's novel, The Biology of Luck, which is reportedly an allegory for modern British politics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Official Monster Raving Loony Party", "response": ["|Howling Laud Hope", "|Howling Laud Hope", "|Howling Laud Hope", "|Howling Laud Hope", "|Howling Laud Hope", "|Howling Laud Hope", "|Howling Laud Hope", "|Howling Laud Hope", "| Howling Laud Hope (Cllr Alan Hope)"]}, {"page": "List of political parties in the United Kingdom", "response": ["| Howling Laud Hope"]}]}}
