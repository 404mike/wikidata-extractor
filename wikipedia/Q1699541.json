He is best known for his work in theoretical condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics, and in particular for research on critical phenomena and two-dimensional conformal field theory.\nHe was an undergraduate and postgraduate student at Downing College, University of Cambridge, before moving to the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he joined the faculty in 1977. In 1993, he moved to the University of Oxford, where until 2014 he was a Fellow of All Souls College (now Emeritus) and a Professor of Physics in the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics. He currently holds a Visiting Professorship at the University of California, Berkeley.\nHe was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1991, received the Dirac Medal of the IoP in 2000, was awarded the Lars Onsager Prize by the APS in 2004, the Boltzmann Medal by IUPAP in 2010, and the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 2011.He is most known for his contributions to conformal field theory. The Cardy formula for black hole entropy, the Cardy formula in percolation theory, and the Cardy conditions in boundary conformal field theory are named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dirac Medal", "response": ["* 2011: \u00c9douard Br\u00e9zin, John Cardy, Alexander Zamolodchikov", "* 2000: John Cardy"]}, {"page": "List of theoretical physicists", "response": ["* John Cardy (born 1947)"]}, {"page": "Clay Research Award", "response": ["| 2001 || Edward Witten  Stanislav Smirnov || \"For a lifetime of achievement, especially for pointing the way to unify apparently disparate fields of mathematics and to discover their elegant simplicity through links with the physical world\"  \"For establishing the existence of the scaling limit of two-dimensional percolation, and for verifying John Cardy's conjectured relation\""]}, {"page": "\u00c9douard Br\u00e9zin", "response": ["He was awarded the 2011 Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics together with John Cardy and Alexander Zamolodchikov."]}, {"page": "Boltzmann Medal", "response": ["* 2010 John Cardy (University of Oxford) and Bernard Derrida (\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure)"]}, {"page": "C-theorem", "response": ["John Cardy in 1988 considered the possibility to generalise C-theorem to higher-dimensional quantum field theory.
