It was opened by Liberal politician George Robinson, the first Marquess of Ripon. The building is Grade II listed, red brick in Neo-Dutch style, and has an especially notable terracotta porch. One wing of the Wileman Building is named the Pfeiffer Wing, after husband and wife Jurgen Edward Pfeiffer and Emily Pfeiffer who funded much of the construction cost as part of their mission to support and develop women's education. The building, and its various more modern wings, contains student rooms, the college library, social areas and study spaces, and various college administrative offices. Next door to the Wileman Building is Wollaston Lodge, a fine symmetrical early-20th century building in buff brick, designed by E. S. Prior, that provides further student accommodation."]}, {"page": "Joshua Girling Fitch", "response": ["In 1890, he with Anthony John Mundella and Anna Swanwick selected the women's colleges and schools among which was distributed the sum of \u00a360,000 left by Mrs. Emily Pfeiffer for the promotion of women's education.
