Her parents were the chairman and managing director of John Jameson & Son Ltd, Andrew Jameson, and Grace Elizabeth Anna Maria (n\u00e9e Burke). She was the middle child of three daughters. Kirkwood studied under Mary Manning, going on to attend Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin from 1908 to 1909. On 4 March 1910, she married Major Thomas William Kirkwood. He was supportive of Kirkwood's artistic pursuits and encouraged her. They lived for a short period in Russia in 1913, where she took lessons in painting from Ilya Mashkov in Moscow. Upon their return to Dublin, she re-registered at the Metropolitan School of Art, and attended the Slade School of Fine Art, London from 1919 to 1920.Her family, the Jamesons, were good friends and patrons for the Yeats family. John Butler Yeats painted numerous portraits of the Jamesons and he encouraged her in her painting. Kirkwood continued the friendship with the Butlers, and invited a number of the most famous artists of the time to her house in Collinstown Park, Clondalkin. She was close friends with Mainie Jellett and Evie Hone. Following their example, she went to Paris to study under Andr\u00e9 Lhote. She was one of six artists who studied under Lhote who exhibited at the Contemporary Pictures Gallery at 133 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin.From 1922, Kirkwood was an active member of the Society of Dublin Painters.
