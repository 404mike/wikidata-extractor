The auction was held on 7 May 1896 in the Grand Hotel, Manchester. The estate was described in the sale catalogue as comprising a \"distinguished family mansion of imposing elevation, built in the Italian style, seated in a beautifully timbered deer park\". However it failed to reach its reported reserve price of \u00a3300,000. There was much public debate, before and after the abortive sale, as to whether Manchester Corporation ought to buy Trafford Park. But it could not agree terms quickly enough, and so, on 23 June 1896, Ernest Terah Hooley became the new owner of Trafford Park, for the sum of \u00a3360,000. Following the sale of Trafford Park, Sir Humphrey moved to Hill Crest, Market Harborough.\nSir Humphrey served as an officer of the Lancashire Hussars Imperial Yeomanry, and was promoted Major 1 July 1901.In 1903 he served as president of the Royal Lancashire Agricultural Society and in 1905, he published Foxhounds of Great Britain and Ireland and their Masters and Huntsmen.\nIn July 1907, Sir Humphrey de Trafford caused scandal in European society circles when he was taken to court for bankruptcy despite claiming an annual income of $240,000.Lady de Trafford died on 20 July 1925. Sir Humphrey died four years later on 10 January 1929, aged 66.\nCorrespondence and government accounts related to death duties payable on Sir Humphrey's estate are held by The National Archives, but remained sealed under a Lord Chancellor's Instrument until 2006.[1]", "link_mentions": {}}}
