Some air force pilots escaped to Aden to join the Escadrille fran\u00e7aise d'Aden under Jacques Dodelier, and Captain Edmond Magendie began training some non-commissioned officers who would become the backbone of the Bataillon de tirailleurs somalis (FR), which later fought in Europe. Some Free French sloops also took part in the blockade. The Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, William Platt, codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland \"Pentagon\", because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the Free French, the British minister at Addis Ababa (Robert Howe), and the United States. The American consul at Aden, Clare H. Timberlake, even bluffed the acting British governor, John Hall, into getting Frederick Hards, AOC Aden, to fly him to Djibouti to interview Nouailhetas before his dismissal. In the end the Americans apologised for this interference."]}, {"page": "Hards", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Hards"]}]}}
