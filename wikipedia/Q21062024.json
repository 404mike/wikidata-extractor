Each time, Brown was seen smiling and laughing at the Rangers players involved, having successfully antagonised them. Responses to his behaviour varied while Police Scotland decided it was a matter for the football authorities. The SFA charged Brown with \"failing to act in the best interest of Scottish football\" for his actions at the final whistle, but at the hearing on 26 April, the verdict was not proven."]}, {"page": "1996 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 November \u2013 Ryan Kent, footballer"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.
