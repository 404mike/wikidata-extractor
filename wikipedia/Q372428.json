Henry the elder had three sons: Edward, Henry and Daniel. Daniel Purcell, the youngest of the brothers, was also a prolific composer who wrote the music for much of the final act of The Indian Queen after his brother Henry's death.

His first important role of which anything is known was as the magician Ismeron in Henry Purcell's opera The Indian Queen, which included the aria \"Ye twice ten hundred deities\".The New Grove Dictionary of Opera: \"Leveridge, Richard\"See also 'An account of Richard Leveridge (with a portrait)', The European Magazine and London Review October 1793, pp. 243\u201344, and November 1793, pp. 363\u201364. Purcell himself remained loyal to the company, and for several months Leveridge worked closely with him. It is likely that \"Arise, ye subterranean winds\" in the music (attributed to Purcell) for The Tempest was written for him. After Purcell's death he continued to work with composers Daniel Purcell and Jeremiah Clarke, and took a leading part in Clarke's Ode upon the death of Mr Purcell at Drury Lane.Baldwin and Wilson, June 1970, p. 523. Leveridge also composed, and in February 1699 all three provided music for Motteux's adaptation of Fletcher's The Island Princess, in which Leveridge's performance, particularly his 'Enthusiastick Song',L.M.

Even more curiously, Purcell's and Eccles's scores were later published by John Walsh. Weldon's however was not and remains in manuscript, though the lack of recognition of his relatively new name may also have played a part.In the Folger Library, Washington, D.C., Ms. Cs. 1479 There is some evidence to suggest that the judges of the competition were not entirely impartial, however it has also been suggested that Weldon's setting was considered less old fashioned than his somewhat older contemporaries.In the printed score of Eccles's The Judgement of Paris, published by Walsh (1702), the composer commented that there were some [judges] 'who came prepar'd to Dislike it'.
