The idea behind the programs was to provide education and training on art production to help people make a living, but also to build appreciation for the beauty of handicrafts. Jebb was able to secure patrons such as Earl Brownlow and his wife, Countess Adelaide; Katherine Cavendish, Duchess of Westminster; and Louisa Beresford, Marchioness of Waterford as patrons. They helped provide not only funding for the schools, but exhibition spaces for the goods to be shown to society figures. She ran the organization until 1887, when health concerns forced her to withdraw from active participation, though she did continue to organize free classes."]}, {"page": "1818 in art", "response": ["*April 14 \u2013 Louisa Beresford, Marchioness of Waterford, French-born British Pre-Raphaelite watercolorist (died 1891)"]}]}}
