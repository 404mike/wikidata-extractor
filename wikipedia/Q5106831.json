The first of these tracks to receive national airplay while remaining entirely exclusive to the streaming platform Sonstream, was 'College Days Over' by Jayne Taylor. Chris Hawkins commented on his show that \"this sounds like a great old tune, but it's brand new... Muscle-Shoals-on-Trent, great song and arrangement.
