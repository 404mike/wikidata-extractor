He studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and exhibited there for a number of years. Why he went to Caracas is unknown, but it seems likely that it was to paint in a market where he would find less competition. He introduced a number of trends from English portraiture to the world of Venezuelan art.\nAdams became acquainted with the Prussian painter Ferdinand Bellermann during the latter's time in Venezuela.", "link_mentions": {}}}
