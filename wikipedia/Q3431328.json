In the opening game at Twickenham Care was partnered by Jonny Wilkinson at fly-half as England won 23\u201319. Paul Ackford of the Sunday Telegraph said Care was \"part of a fine half-back pairing\". Care received widespread praise, especially in Wales, for his sportsmanship during the game in refusing to play the ball at the base of a ruck when it was clear that Welsh full-back Morgan Stoddart was badly injured following a tackle. Referee Steve Walsh was forced to stop the game to allow Stoddart to be treated for what turned out to be a double fracture of tibia and fibia. For the return game in Cardiff a week later Wilkinson was rested in favour of Toby Flood and Care was on the replacements' bench with Richard Wigglesworth starting. Care was on the field as early as the 29th minute when Wigglesworth suffered a head injury. England lost 19\u20139 but Stephen Jones of the Sunday Times, a longtime critic of Care, said \"Danny Care made a significant impact and was probably England's best player\". Unfortunately Care sustained a torn plantar plate affecting the big toe of his left foot during the game, an injury which required surgery and which kept him out of England's squad for the World Cup. The medical reports confirming that surgery was required came just a few hours after Care had been informed by England Head Coach Martin Johnson that he would be included in the squad."]}, {"page": "Kirkham Grammar School", "response": ["In recent years Kirkham Grammar School has produced a number of rugby players who have appeared at the highest level of the sport, Richard Wigglesworth and Kieran Brookes were part of the 2015 England's Six Nations squad, while Kieran Marmion was part of the Ireland squad.
