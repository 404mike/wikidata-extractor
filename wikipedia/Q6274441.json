He trained at RADA, graduating in 1994. From there, he went to work at the Royal National Theatre and Shakespeare's Globe. He has also worked extensively with the Royal Shakespeare Company, including the Complete Works and This England: The Histories cycles, playing Richard II, Fluellen, Richard Duke of York and Richard III. He played Bernard Woolley, the Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary, in the stage version of Yes, Prime Minister (Chichester/London, 2010). In 2011, he appeared again with the Royal Shakespeare Company in the title role of Macbeth, a new production by Michael Boyd which was the first Shakespeare play to appear in the revamped Royal Shakespeare Theatre. In 2012 he played Malvolio and Prospero for the RSC in London and Stratford, and in 2013 he played Hamlet. From May 2015, he started playing Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Musical in London at Theatre Royal Drury Lane.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Accrington", "response": ["*Jonathan Slinger, RADA trained actor"]}, {"page": "Yes Minister", "response": ["Jay and Lynn collaborated again to produce a stage play which ran from 13 May to 5 June 2010, at Chichester Festival Theatre. This production revived at the Gielgud Theatre, in London's West End from 17 September 2010 until 15 January 2011. The principal cast was David Haig as Jim Hacker, Henry Goodman as Sir Humphrey, Jonathan Slinger as Bernard Woolley and Emily Joyce as Claire Sutton, Hacker's special policy advisor. This production, while following the spirit and tone of the original series in many respects, was set contemporaneously at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country residence, with BlackBerrys frequently in evidence,Remarkably, Sir Humphrey was able to show Bernard Woolley how to disable the Prime Minister's BlackBerry. and even included a topical reference to a coalition agreement which Sir Humphrey had drafted (the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats having formed a coalition government in Britain in May 2010).Antony Jay & Jonathan Lynn (2010) Yes, Prime Minister (the play) (Faber & Faber). In reality, during the negotiations that led to the coalition government in 2010, the two parties appear largely to have shunned support available to them from the civil service: see David Laws (2010) 22 Days in May and Rob Wilson (2010) 5 Days To Power, who concluded that, \"probably the influence of the civil service, including the Cabinet Secretary, in pushing the [parties] together to avoid a financial crisis has been overplayed\". The plot was a little more provocative and risqu\u00e9 than most of those seen previously (including a debate about the ethics of procuring a twelve-year-old as a sexual partner for a visiting dignitary,Yes, Prime Minister, act 1, scene 2 (pages 36\u201340) a proposition which it is suggested might be spun in the national interest as a \"euro-job\")Yes, Prime Minister, act 2, scene 1 (page 61). The suggestion of \"euro-job\" was prompted by Hacker's objection to \"Anglo-Kumranistan Liaison Project\" as \"a bit of a mouthful\": ibid. and included some stronger expletives (reflecting perhaps their widely reported use among New Labour's hierarchy between 1997 and 2010).See, for example, Alastair Campbell (2007) The Blair Years; Andrew Rawnsley (2010) The End of the Party; Anthony Seldon  & Guy Lodge (2010) Brown at 10.

He has still been played by several actors in post-war performances. At the 1947 Avignon Festival, Pierre Lautrec played to Jean Vilar's Richard; Vilar also directed the play.

In 1968 the Prospect Theatre toured Richard II in two legs. Directed by Richard Cottrell and with Ian McKellen and Timothy West as Richard and Bolingbroke respectively, Ross was played by Peter Rocca on the first half of the tour and David Calder on the second. In 1973, Charles Keating played Ross to Richard Pasco and Ian Richardson's king and Bolingbroke, in John Barton's production. Ariane Mnouchkine's 1984 production for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil cast Robert Gourp as Ross, and five years later the English Shakespeare Company's production\u2014directed by Michael Bogdanov\u2014had John Dougall playing Ross to Michael Pennington's Richard.
