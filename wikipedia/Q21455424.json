She was a potter and they married on 7 July 1923 in St Mary's Church, Frensham. Alice had \"severe psychological difficulties\" and Winnicott arranged for her, and his own therapy, to address the difficulties this condition created. He obtained a post as physician at the Paddington Green Children's Hospital in London, where he was to work as a paediatrician and child psychoanalyst for 40 years. In 1923 he began a ten-year psychoanalysis with James Strachey, and in 1927 he began training as an analytic candidate. Strachey discussed Winnicott's case with his wife Alix Strachey, apparently reporting that Winnicott's sex life was affected by his anxieties. Winnicott's second analysis, beginning in 1936, was with Joan Riviere."]}, {"page": "Upchurch Pottery", "response": ["In the mid-1930s it was bought by Alice Buxton Winnicott and here she manufactured her Claverdon tableware.Clifford Yorke, \u2018Winnicott, Donald Woods (1896\u20131971)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2015 accessed 20 Feb 2017 named after her birthplace and sold in Heals, on the Tottenham Court Road, London.Greer, J (2014) Learning from Linked Lives, unpublished thesis, University of Southampton"]}, {"page": "Sedgwick Club", "response": ["* Alice Buxton Winnicott"]}]}}
