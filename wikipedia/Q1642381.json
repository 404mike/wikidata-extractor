The event was heavily impacted by boycotts by two of the top fencing nations over rules disputes. A dispute over the target area for foil fencing resulted in France initially boycotting the foil events and, at the last minute, expanding the boycott to all fencing events. A dispute over the maximum length of the \u00e9p\u00e9e blade resulted in Italy boycotting the \u00e9p\u00e9e events (though Italy did compete in other fencing events). These disputes would result in the creation of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale d'Escrime to establish a governing body for the sport.Official Report, p. 455.
