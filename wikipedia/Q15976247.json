His Miscellany Accounts of his diocese, compiled in 1707\u20134, were published in 1877 by Richard Saul Ferguson. They were from his own observations, or from trusted witnesses. He found in 1703 the neglected Holmcultram Abbey full of water. Charles Murray Lowther Bouch used Nicolson's records to conclude that 70% of the churches in the diocese were then in tolerable condition, with 10% very bad."]}, {"page": "Richard Ferguson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Richard Saul Ferguson (1837\u20131900), antiquary"]}, {"page": "List of mayors of Carlisle", "response": ["*1912-14: Spencer Charles Ferguson (son of Richard Saul Ferguson)"]}, {"page": "History of medieval Cumbria", "response": ["As an example of Viking relics, a hoard of Viking coins and silver objects was discovered in the Eden valley at Penrith. Also in the Eden valley were finds at Hesket and at Ormside, which has been mentioned above as the site of a possible Viking grave-good. The other areas of Viking finds include Carlisle (west of the Cathedral), pagan graves at CumwhittonNewman (2014), pp. 51\u201358 and finds in the Lune valley and on the west coast (for example, Beckermet, where a hoard was discovered in 2014, Aspatria and St. Michael's Church, Workington). However, relatively little else has come down to us apart from the sculpture. Despite this, interest in the Viking aspect of Cumbria, arguably almost on a par with that of the Neolithic, Roman and Border Reivers aspects, has been fuelled, particularly from the 19th century on, by the tourism boom in the Lake District (with its preponderance of Scandinavian names), by notions of rugged, free and independent 'statesmen' (estates men) of Viking stock, forming, according to William Wordsworth, a \"Perfect Republic of Shepherds and Agriculturalists\",Wordsworth (1977), p. 67. and by an interest in Scandinavian history and language promoted by writers and antiquaries such as W. G. Collingwood, Thomas de Quincey, William Slater Calverley, Hardwicke Rawnsley, Richard Saul Ferguson, Charles Arundel Parker, George Stephens, Thomas Ellwood, and others, dubbed the \"Old Northernists\" by some modern historians.Townend (2009), pp. xv, 328."]}, {"page": "Popular County Histories", "response": ["|1890 ||Cumberland||Richard Saul Ferguson", "|1894||Westmorland||Richard Saul Ferguson"]}, {"page": "Hugh Todd (author)", "response": ["Todd published a number of poems.
