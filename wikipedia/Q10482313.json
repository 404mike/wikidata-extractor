Goals for United came from John Fleck in the 3rd minute, Mark Duffy in the 67th minute, and two (in the 15th and 77th minute respectively) from Leon Clarke against his former side, with Gary Hooper in the 47th minute (scored in the first half as two minutes were added on) and Lucas Joao (65') scoring for Wednesday. This game was nicknamed the 'Bouncing Day Massacre' by the United fans, due to a chant by the Wednesday fans following Joao's goal that ended abruptly as a result of Mark Duffy's goal shortly afterwards.", "The first of the two derbies was hosted by Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on Friday 9 November 2018, kicking off at 7:45\u00a0pm after completing a minute of silence in remembrance of soldiers who gave their lives in conflict. Sky UK, who televised the match, were later criticised and branded disrespectful for playing canned crowd noise over the performance of the Last Post, when the crowd were, in fact, silent. Just 14 minutes into the game, Sheffield United's Mark Duffy was fouled by Sheffield Wednesday's Morgan Fox and was awarded a penalty, taken by David McGoldrick and saved by Cameron Dawson. The night ended with a goalless draw."]}, {"page": "Michael O'Neill (footballer)", "response": ["O'Neill was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Stoke City on 8 November 2019.
