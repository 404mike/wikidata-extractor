He also pointed to the fact that Amazon had paid no federal income tax in the previous year. Sanders solicited stories from Amazon warehouse workers who felt exploited by the company. One such story, by James Bloodworth, described the environment as akin to \"a low-security prison\" and stated that the company's culture used an Orwellian newspeak. These reports cited a finding by New Food Economy that one third of fulfilment center workers in Arizona were on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Responses by Amazon included incentives for employees to tweet positive stories and a statement which called the salary figures used by Sanders \"inaccurate and misleading\". The statement also charged that it was inappropriate for him to refer to SNAP as \"food stamps\". On September 5, 2018, Sanders along with Ro Khanna introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act aimed at Amazon and other alleged beneficiaries of corporate welfare such as Walmart, McDonald's and Uber. Among the bill's supporters were Tucker Carlson of Fox News and Matt Taibbi who criticized himself and other journalists for not covering Amazon's contribution to wealth inequality earlier."]}, {"page": "Insult", "response": ["Verbal insults often take a phallic or pudendal form; this includes offensive profanity,Desmond Morris, The Naked Ape Trilogy (London 1994) p. 241Emma Renold, Girls, Boys, and Junior Sexualities (2005) p. 130 and may also include insults to one's sexuality.

The terms \"open\" and \"closed\" for this divide were first used by then-British prime minister Tony Blair in 2006, with reference to the horseshoe theory that far-left and far-right politics are similar in substance. Blair, who declared himself staunchly for \"open\", had overseen the development of the Third Way New Labour movement in 1990s and the schism in the Labour Party between \"open\" Blairites and \"closed\" traditional socialists has remained. Political analyst James Bloodworth criticised Blair's choice of terminology, describing \"closed\" as pejorative to those threatened by globalism and \"open\" as overly laudatory of the \"Davos Man\" type of globalist."]}, {"page": "Novara Media", "response": ["On 26 October 2021, Novara Media's YouTube was deleted without explanation, and Novara called on YouTube to reinstate it.

In response, advocacy group Big Brother Watch, Chief executive Ed Proctor of the Independent Monitor for the Press, and Novara contributor Ash Sarkar criticised YouTube for online censorship. Libertarian journalist and columnist Brendan O'Neill opined that Novara Media was a victim of the \"cancel culture\" that the left had allegedly helped create.

The book is a critique of the popular figures associated with the intellectual dark web. It also argues that a focus on deplatforming has harmed the left's ability to organize, drawing upon Mark Fisher's essay Exiting the Vampire Castle (2013). It argues against essentialist thinking on the right and the left, and advocates a \"cosmopolitan socialism\" that is \"open to all cultures and...embrace[s] and encourage[s] cultural exchange and syncretism\" as an alternative. In Jacobin, Luke Savage called the book a \"model blueprint for countering the reactionary narratives ascendant in the smoldering ruins of the neoliberal order.\" In UnHerd, James Bloodworth called the book \"the most substantial critique of the IDW and its brand of 'classical liberalism' to date.\""]}]}}
