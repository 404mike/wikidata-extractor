In 1905, she attended Julius Olsson's School of Landscape and Marine Painting under Algernon Talmage.", "While studying at the Slade School, McNicoll met British painter Dorothea Sharp with whom she formed a lifelong bond with, nicknaming each other \"Nellie\" and \"Dolly\". The two women traveled together, shared studio spaces, and posed for each other's paintings. In McNicoll's case, having a companion was especially helpful due to obstacles she must have faced due to her hearing loss. McNicoll relied on Sharp's skills in negotiating with models--specifically children, into posing. In The Chintz Sofa by McNicoll, Sharp is depicted in their shared London studio."]}, {"page": "Sharp (surname)", "response": ["* Dorothea Sharp (1874\u20131955), British artist"]}, {"page": "Society of Women Artists", "response": ["* 1932\u20131933\tDorothea Sharp"]}, {"page": "List of English women artists", "response": ["*Dorothea Sharp (1874\u20131955), painter"]}]}}
