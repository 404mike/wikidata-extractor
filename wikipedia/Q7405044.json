He formed Ariel in London with friends Brendan Melck and Mathew Berry. Their first single was \"Sea of Beats\", which was essentially a white label. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was \"Bokadilo\". Other songs, released on 12-inch, included \"Mustn't Grumble\" and their most well-known, \"Rollercoaster\". After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the record label deConstruction. They insisted on a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman Sally Ann Marsh, and after some disappointing songs like \"Let It Slide\" (Rowlands would later describe it as \"a stinker\"), the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song \"T Baby\" which was remixed by the pair. In regards to the remix, Ed stated that \"Ariel symbolically ended when Deconstruction asked us for a Dust Brothers remix of an Ariel track. That was the final nail in the coffin.\""]}, {"page": "1994 in film", "response": ["|The Princess and the Goblin || Hemdale Film Corporation / J&M Entertainment || J\u00f3zsef G\u00e9mes (director); Robin Lyons (screenplay); Joss Ackland, Claire Bloom, Roy Kinnear, Sally Ann Marsh, Rik Mayall, Peggy Mount || Adventure, Fantasy || Animation"]}, {"page": "Dani Behr", "response": ["Behr was born in Mill Hill, London, of South African Jewish descent.
