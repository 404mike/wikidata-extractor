Stimulated by contemporary art movements, the original group of 14 artists, met in November 1944, they intended to raise standards of local professional art to something worthy of the artistic history of Norfolk, by mutual criticism and appraisal of work. On 8 January 1945, they named the group the Norwich Twenty Group and a constitution was signed. N20G continues to flourish with new members. Since 1944, over 270 artists have been members. Some of the artists have included Bernard Reynolds, Edward Barker, Leslie Davenport, Michael Andrews, Mary Newcomb, Hamilton Wood, Jeffery Camp and Cavendish Morton. Since 1945 and until the end of 2013, some 150 art shows have been organised. Shows have taken place in 97 venues in Norwich, 35 in East Anglia, 11 outside East Anglia and 7 in Europe. Many of the artists trained at the Norwich School of Art and Design, now Norwich University of the Arts, Royal College of Art, Slade School of Fine Art, and other well known art schools. Many have travelled widely, studying the arts of other cultures and have exhibited regionally, nationally and internationally. Current members include 88 artists, with three life members and four honorary members. Several NUA graduates are invited to join the group every year, for one year, under the licentiate scheme. Meeting challenges in today's contemporary art, N20G now encompasses artists working in all media from paint, sculpture, installations and digital, ever seeking to nurture new members and forms of art."]}, {"page": "Mary Newcomb", "response": ["thumb|Mary Newcomb, 1923", "Mary Newcomb (1893\u20131966) was an American actress who appeared on the American and British stage and in films.", "Mary Newcomb was born on August 21, 1893, in North Adams, Massachusetts, the daughter of Josiah Turner Newcomb, and Sophie De Wolfe Newcomb. She grew up in New York City and La Grangeville in Dutchess County, New York. She attended Lauralton Hall Academy, a convent school for girls in Milford Connecticut.", "Newcomb married banker Alexander Henry Higginson on June 28, 1925. Alex was from Boston, the son of Henry Lee Higginson, a financier, and Ida Agassiz, the daughter of Louis Agassiz, a noted Harvard professor. Alex was known as an accomplished yachtsman, steeplechaser, and fox hunter. After her marriage Mary retired from the stage briefly and lived with Alex in South Lincoln, Mass. and the Back Bay of Boston. With encouragement from Alex, Mary resumed her acting career in New York in 1927. Together Alex and Mary rented an apartment at 135 East 56th St. She appeared in \u201cA Woman Disputed\u201d and then again in \u201cThe Distant Drum\u201d by Vincent Lawrence at the Hudson Theatre. At that time J. Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times wrote of her, \u201cMary Newcomb returning from what seems to have been a retirement of some minor sort makes an unusually sympathetic and appealing character of the wife, a part which is with truth from beginning to end.\u201d She also appeared in \u201cSign on the Door in by Robert R. Mill in March of 1928. In May of 1928 the Higginson\u2019s apartment was robbed.

Her troupe included actors from London and other places, and whenever possible Mary recruited soldiers who were stationed at various bases to take parts in her productions. In her later years Mary described driving at night during the blackout without headlights down country roads in Southern England to put on performances at obscure bases. In an account of the Players\u2019 first performance of \u201cIn the Zone\u201d by Eugene O\u2019Neill, featuring several young soldiers and presented before 500 of their fellow soldiers, Mary wrote, \u201cIn my Prompt Corner I trembled and paled and doubted that one line would ever be spoken, much less heard. But I was wrong. Utterly sincere and unselfconscious, the boys had their audience quiet and listening in two minutes, and held them so \u2013 with the help of Mr. O\u2019Neill \u2013 for forty.\u201d Among the Players\u2019 other productions were \u201cThe Man With A Load Of Mischief\u201d, \u201cFrench Leave\u201d, \u201cGas Light\u201d, and \u201cJealousy\u201d.\u00a0 In 1943 Mary took her Players to London to raise money to support the troupe's efforts by performing several benefit plays including \u201cA Man With A Load Of Mischief\u201d and Eugene O\u2019Neill's \u201cDays Without End.\u201d\u00a0 After the D- Day landings in Normandy The Mary Newcomb Players traveled to France, Holland, and Belgium to continue their support for the war effort.", "After World War II, Mary Newcomb's focus remained with her husband Alex in Dorset.
