It follows the life of Stephen Gordon, an Englishwoman from an upper-class family whose \"sexual inversion\" (homosexuality) is apparent from an early age. She finds love with Mary Llewellyn, whom she meets while serving as an ambulance driver in World War I, but their happiness together is marred by social isolation and rejection, which Hall depicts as typically suffered by \"inverts\", with predictably debilitating effects. The novel portrays \"inversion\" as a natural, God-given state and makes an explicit plea: \"Give us also the right to our existence\".", "In 1926, Radclyffe Hall was at the height of her career. Her novel Adam's Breed, about the spiritual awakening of an Italian headwaiter, had become a best-seller; it would soon win the Prix Femina and the James Tait Black Prize.Souhami, 159, 172. She had long thought of writing a novel about sexual inversion; now, she believed, her literary reputation would allow such a work to be given a hearing. Since she knew she was risking scandal and \"the shipwreck of her whole career\", she sought and received the blessing of her partner, Una Troubridge, before she began work.Baker, Our Three Selves, 188. Her goals were social and political; she wanted to end public silence about homosexuality and bring about \"a more tolerant understanding\"\u00a0\u2013 as well as to \"spur all classes of inverts to make good through hard work...and sober and useful living\".Souhami, 164, 171.", "Many of those familiar with the subculture she described, including her own friends, disagreed with her portrayal of it; Romaine Brooks called her \"a digger-up of worms with the pretension of a distinguished archaeologist\".Cline, 273\u2013274. Hall's correspondence shows that the negative view of bars like Alec's that she expressed in The Well was sincerely meant,Baker, Our Three Selves, 253\u2013254. but she also knew that such bars did not represent the only homosexual communities in Paris.Cline, 227, 273. It is a commonplace of criticism that her own experience of lesbian life was not as miserable as Stephen's.Love. Diana Souhami's comments on the subject are particularly sharp; she says Hall \"might have acknowledged the privilege, seductions, freedom, and fun that graced her daily life\" (173) and, in response to Hall's claim to be writing on behalf of some of the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world, remarks \"It is doubtful whether Radclyffe Hall and Una, Natalie Barney...and the rest, with their fine houses, stylish lovers, inherited incomes, sparkling careers and villas in the sun, were among the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world.\" (181\u201382) By focusing on misery and describing its cause as \"ceaseless persecution\" by \"the so-called just and righteous\", she intensified the urgency of her plea for change.Quotation from Hall, 388\u2013389. Interpretation from Cline, 227.", "James Douglas illustrated his denunciation of The Well with a photograph of Radclyffe Hall in a silk smoking jacket and bow tie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later Sunday Express articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to tell she was not wearing trousers.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 185\u2013191. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and short skirts was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the \"severely masculine\" look.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 114\u2013117 and passim. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style as a way of signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read.Langer, 45 and Elliott, 74. With the controversy over The Well of Loneliness, Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 27, 193. Lesbian journalist Evelyn Irons\u00a0\u2013 who considered Hall's style of dress \"rather effeminate\" compared to her own\u00a0\u2013 said that after the publication of The Well, truck drivers would call out on the street to any woman who wore a collar and tie: \"Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall\".Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 113, 123. Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 124\u2013125. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of The Well because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.Bullough, 897.", "Papers from the author's archive, which are set to be digitised by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas alongside those of her partner, the artist Una Vincenzo, Lady Troubridge, show that the novel was supported by thousands of readers, who wrote to Hall in outrage at the ban.\u2018It has made me want to live\u2019: public support for lesbian novelist Radclyffe Hall over banned book revealed, The Guardian, 10 January 2019", "Three other novels with lesbian themes were published in England in 1928: Elizabeth Bowen's The Hotel, Virginia Woolf's Orlando and Compton Mackenzie's satirical novel Extraordinary Women. None were banned.Foster, 281\u2013287. The Hotel, like earlier English novels in which critics have identified lesbian themes, is marked by complete reticence, while Orlando may have been protected by its Modernist playfulness.Winning, 375; Parkes. The Home Office considered prosecuting Extraordinary Women, but concluded that it lacked the \"earnestness\" of The Well and would not inspire readers to adopt \"the practices referred to\".Marshik. Mackenzie was disappointed; he had hoped a censorship case would increase his book's sales.Souhami, 237. Despite advertising that tried to cash in on the controversy over The Well by announcing that Radclyffe Hall was the model for one of the characters,Baker, Our Three Selves, 254\u2013255. it sold only 2,000 copies.", "A fourth 1928 novel, Ladies Almanack by the American writer Djuna Barnes, not only contains a character based on Radclyffe Hall but includes passages that may be a response to The Well.Barnes, xxxi. Ladies Almanack is a roman \u00e0 clef of a lesbian literary and artistic circle in Paris, written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style and starring Natalie Barney as Dame Evangeline Musset. Much as Sir Phillip paces his study worrying about Stephen, Dame Musset's father \"pac[es] his library in the most normal of Night-Shirts\". When, unlike Sir Phillip, he confronts his daughter, she replies confidently: \"Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing\u00a0... Am I not doing after your very Desire, and is it not the more commendable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?\"Barnes, 8. Susan Sniader Lanser notes the resemblance of this scene to The Well; Barnes, xxxv. Ladies Almanack is far more overtly sexual than The Well; its cryptic style, full of in-jokes and ornate language, may have been intended to disguise its content from censors.Barnes, xli\u2013xlii. It could not in any case be prosecuted by the Home Office, since it was published only in France, in a small, privately printed edition. It did not become widely available until 1972.Barnes, xv\u2013xviii.", "** Halberstam, Judith (2001). \"'A Writer of Misfits': 'John' Radclyffe Hall and the Discourse of Inversion\".
