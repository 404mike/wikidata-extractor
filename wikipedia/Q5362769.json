Many considered she had performed well and should not have had to reapply for the role when her three-year contract came up for renewal.On 18 July 2011, it was announced that Elizabeth Filkin would lead an inquiry related to the News International phone hacking scandal which would \"recommend changes to links between the police and the media, including how to extend transparency.\" The report of the inquiry was published at the beginning of 2012.Filkin was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for public service.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Prescott", "response": ["In 2003, Prescott gave up a home that he had rented from the RMT Union in Clapham; he had left the union in June 2002.

Though he had not declared the flat in the register of members' interests, he was subsequently exonerated by MPs who overruled Elizabeth Filkin, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. On 12 January 2006, Prescott apologised after it was revealed that the council tax for the government flat he occupied at Admiralty House was paid from public money, rather than his private income.
