Under the guardianship of Dr. Carl Von Strumpf (Fred G. Hearn), one of these children, Robert Busch (Earl Schenck), grows up believing that he is the son of wealthy German-American Richard Busch (Percy Standing), but in reality, Strumpf and Busch are servants of the Kaiser. When the United States declares war on Germany, Robert expresses his earnest desire to enlist in the American army, much to the delight of his patriotic sister Emily (Claire Whitney). Before he can do so, however, Strumpf tells Robert the secret of his parentage, believing that the young man now will be eager to fight for Germany's cause. Robert feigns enthusiasm but secretly offers his services to the U.S. government, and with the passport provided him by the Pan-German league, he goes to Germany and kills the crown prince (also played by Schenck). Next, he shoots the Kaiser and blows up the entire palace, thus sacrificing his life for the principles of democracy.", "*Percy Standing as Richard Busch"]}, {"page": "Every Mother's Son (1918 film)", "response": ["*Percy Standing - An American Father"]}, {"page": "The Flame of Love", "response": ["* Percy Standing as Col.
