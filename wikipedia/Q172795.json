This was also the year the Brands grew up, running Formula One cars for the first time on 14 October. Initially, a long-distance race was planned, but in the end a 15-lap race was run which attracted four work entries from Connaught (B-Types for Archie Scott Brown, Les Leston, Jack Fairman and Stuart Lewis-Evans) opposed by privately entered Maserati 250Fs driven by Roy Salvadori and Bruce Halford and a selection of independents. Archie won from Lewis-Evans, with Salvadori setting a new lap record in the process at a speed of 75.66\u00a0mph.

He drove mainly for John Dalton, usually in non-championship events with moderate success, a fifth in the Lombank Trophy and a third in the Lavant Cup being the highlights of his season. He was entered to 1962 Le Mans in June by Colin Chapman to co-drive with Les Leston with a Lotus 23, but the race organizer, ACO, denied the entry in the famous Lotus Le Mans debacle. He also entered three Formula One World championship events, at Aintree, where he retired with a failed cylinder head gasket, and at the N\u00fcrburgring and Monza, where he failed to qualify on each occasion. At the end of the season he returned to New Zealand where he continued to race in 1963 and 1964 following which he retired, although he did compete occasionally thereafter."]}, {"page": "Connaught Engineering", "response": ["| Les Leston"]}]}}
