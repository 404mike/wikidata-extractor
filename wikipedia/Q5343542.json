Edward Hull, director of the Irish section of the Geological Survey, gave evidence on the ready availability of water from the New Red Sandstone aquifer around Manchester. He estimated that one square mile could yield 139,000 gallons a day; a single well would give up to two million gallons a day. The Delamere Forest region, 25 miles from Manchester,  had 126 square miles of the sandstone and was untapped: it should be possible to extract 16,500,000 gallons a day from it.evidence of Professor Hull F.R.S.  George Symons gave evidence on rainfall. He predicted that in the driest year, the rainfall at Thirlmere would be no more than 60 inches; about ten inches of this would be lost in evaporation, and Manchester were promising to maintain flows down St John's Beck equivalent to another nine inches. In cross-examination he conceded that he had had a rain gauge at Thirlmere since 1866 and the lowest annual rainfall it had recorded was 82 inches; re-examined he thought Manchester could not get 50 million gallons a day from Thirlmere; the most they could rely upon was 25 million gallons a day.evidence of G.J.Symons, F.R.S.  Alderman King, the only Manchester alderman to have voted against the scheme, reported that since 1874 the water consumption had decreased and in his opinion Manchester's present supply was adequate for the next ten years. He pointed out that Bateman had originally suggested using Ullswater, rather than Thirlmere, as a reservoir, and had at the start of the Longdendale scheme been over-optimistic in his estimate of its cost and yield; he therefore thought the Thirlmere scheme  imprudent from the point of view of Manchester ratepayers.evidence of Alderman King "]}, {"page": "Edward Hull", "response": ["Edward Hull may refer to:", "* Edward Hull (cricketer) (1879-1947), Jamaican cricketer", "* Edward Hull (geologist) (1829\u20131917), Irish geologist", "* Edward Hull (watercolourist) (1823\u20131906), British illustrator and watercolour painter", "* Sir Edward Hull, Tudor knight on List of Knights and Ladies of the Garter"]}, {"page": "Eleanor Hull", "response": ["Hull was born in England, of a County Down family, the daughter of Edward Hull.Norman Vance (2004). \"Hull, Eleanor Henrietta [Eibhl\u00edn N\u00ed Choill (1860\u20131935)]\".

The Coal Measures are over 1200\u00a0metres (4000\u00a0ft)) thick, and coal accounts for about 4% of their thickness. The coalfield is crossed by several major faults, which generally run in a north and south direction. The most significant easterly fault described by Edward Hull throws the strata down to the east. It was worked from Fairbottom in Ashton-under-Lyne across the River Medlock to Oldham and onwards to the west of Rochdale. The Red Rock Fault skirts the north-west extremity of the North Staffordshire coalfield towards Macclesfield and Poynton Colliery in Cheshire. The Irwell Valley or Pendleton Fault passes Clifton and Kearsley, where it throws the coal measures down to the north-east. It has a throw of 3000\u00a0feet (900\u00a0metres) and the area is still geologically active and subject to earth tremors. A fault with a large horizontal but small vertical throw is found at Tyldesley. In the deep mines at the southern edge of the coalfield, the Plodder mine in Leigh and the Arley mine in Tyldesley were hot: the miners worked in temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38\u00a0\u00b0C)."]}, {"page": "Professor Edward Hull", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Hull (geologist)"]}, {"page": "G.
