The doctrine thus complements the teaching that no permanent, independent self can be found.\" Ajahn Brahm argues that the grammar of the above passage indicates that one feature of the Buddhist principle of causality is that \"there can be a substantial time interval between a cause and its effect. It is a mistake to assume that the effect follows one moment after its cause, or that it appears simultaneously with its cause.\"", "There are numerous interpretations of the doctrine of dependent origination across the different Buddhist traditions and within them as well. Various systematizations of the doctrine were developed by the Abhidharma traditions which arose after the death of the Buddha. Modern scholars have also interpreted the teaching in different ways. According to Ajahn Brahm, a fully correct understanding of dependent origination can only be known by awakened being or ariyas. Brahm notes that \"this goes a long way to answering the question why there is so much difference of opinion on the meaning of dependent origination.\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 263.", "Ajahn Brahm has argued that the Buddhist doctrine of conditionality includes two main elements of the logical concepts of conditionality: necessity and sufficiency. According to Brahm, \u201cwhen this is, that is; from the arising of this, that arises.\u201d refers to a \"sufficient condition\" while \u201cwhen this is not, that is not; from the ceasing of this, that ceases\u201d refers to a \"necessary condition\". Like Brahm, Bodhi also argues that there are two main characterizations of conditionality in the early sources. One is positive, indicating \"a contributory influence passing from the condition to the dependent state,\" while the other is negative, indicating \"the impossibility of the dependent state appearing in the absence of its condition.\" He compares these two with the first and second phrases of the general principle definition respectively. Regarding the second, positive characterization, other early sources also state that a condition \"originates (samudaya) the dependent state, provides it with a source (nid\u0101na), generates it (j\u0101tika), gives it being (pabhava), nourishes it (\u0101h\u0101ra), acts as its foundation (upanis\u0101), causes it to surge (upay\u0101peti)\" (see: SN 12.11, 23, 27, 66, 69).Bodhi, Bhikkhu (1995). The Great Discourse on Causation - The Mah\u0101nid\u0101na Sutta and Its Commentaries (Second Edition), p. 9. Buddhist Publication Society Kandy \u2022 Sri Lanka.", "Ajahn Brahm agrees, writing that the main purpose of dependent origination is to explain \"how there can be rebirth without a soul\" and \"why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an end.\" Brahm cites the definitions of the nidanas in the Vibha\u1e45gasutta (SN 12.2) which clearly indicate that birth and death is meant literally. According to Brahm,Pa\u1e6dicca-samupp\u0101da shows the empty process, empty of a soul that is, which flows within a life and overflows into another life. It also shows the forces at work in the process, which drive it this way and that, even exercising sway in a subsequent life. Dependent origination also reveals the answer to how kamma done in a previous life can affect a person in this life.  Brahm argues that there are two parallel processes at work in dependent origination (which are really one process looked at from different angles), one is delusion and kamma leading to rebirth consciousness (nidanas # 1 - 3) and the other is craving and clinging leading to existence and rebirth (# 8 - 11). Brahm describes this as follows: \"deluded kamma and craving produce the fuel which generates existence and rebirth (into that existence), thereby giving rise to the start of the stream of consciousness that is at the heart of the new life.\""]}, {"page": "Index of Buddhism-related articles", "response": ["* Ajahn Brahm"]}, {"page": "Ajahn Chah", "response": ["*Ajahn Brahmavamso, abbot of Bodhinyana Monastery, Western Australia"]}, {"page": "Religion in Singapore", "response": ["Occasionally, Buddhist monks from the west such as Ajahn Brahm, who resided in Australia, is invited to Singapore to give Buddhist Talks to the public.
