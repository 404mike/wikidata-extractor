However, after a succession of players left the club, including popular goalkeeper Stephen Grindlay, defender Chris Boyle and winger Ryan Borris, McCabe found it hard to replace them. Lack of goals was evident in the league when new signings Brian McPhee and David McFarlane failed to hit the net on a regular basis. This led to Dumbarton sitting third bottom of the league. With only 3 wins out of 11 league games, McCabe was dismissed in November 2007 after only 18 months at the Strathclyde Homes Stadium."]}, {"page": "Stephen grindlay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stephen Grindlay "]}, {"page": "2008 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||12 || Stephen Grindlay"]}, {"page": "Ayrshire derby", "response": ["In January 2009, the two clubs met for the first time in over seven years.

Ayr keeper Stephen Grindlay also saved a penalty kick from Kilmarnock's Allan Russell. In the replay at Rugby Park, Ayr United took the lead with a goal from Bryan Prunty, which television replays confirmed had involved the use of his hand.

Scott Agnew and David Mitchell went to the Third Division to play with Stranraer, as did Kevin Cawley, who joined East Stirlingshire and Andy Aitken who joined his home town club Annan Athletic. However, manager Brian Reid brought in David Crawford, who was voted the Player of the Year at Alloa Athletic the season before and Ryan McWilliams from Greenock Morton as goalkeepers. Chris Smith and Bobby Donnelly were signed at the back, but were later joined by Eddie Malone and the well-experienced Jim Lauchlan. Alan Trouten and Scott McLaughlin were signed from Airdrie United as did Ryan McCann later in the campaign, Stephen McKeown was also signed but only played 6 games before his contract was terminated after a bust up with the management. Andy Rodgers was signed from East Stirlingshire and Michael Moffat joined in January from Junior side Girvan. Reid also brought in players such as Stephen Reynolds (from St Johnstone) and Daniel McKay (from Kilmarnock) in on Loan.
