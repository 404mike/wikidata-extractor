Henry Seymour Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson officiated, in one of his last public acts before departing to take up the Indian Command. Rawlinson's mother was from East Knoyle, and he had been brought up there as a child; his cousin Jane Margaret Seymour owned and leased out Knoyle House at the time. Another cousin, Colonel Henry Hales Pleydell-Bouverie, was a trustee to the estate of their uncle Alfred Seymour, which had donated to the memorial's fund. Rawlinson had also been friends with George Wyndham, whose son Percy Lyulph Wyndham had served as Rawlinson's aide-de-camp before his death in the First Battle of the Aisne in 1914.", "The ceremony began in St Mary's Church and, led by the choir and clergy, proceeded to the memorial. The rector and curate\u2014Rev. William Neville and Rev. E. A. Reader, respectively\u2014conducted a brief service and Rev. Frank E. Yeomans, the Primitive Methodist minister in nearby Mere, read a lesson, before Rawlinson removed a Union Jack from the memorial and delivered a speech. Rawlinson read the inscription on the front of the memorial, then commented on his childhood in East Knoyle; he recalled a number of people, such as his late uncle Alfred Seymour, and said one had been a close friend and aide-de-camp. Those whose names were engraved had done their duty, Rawlinson said, and the cross was erected as a memorial to their bravery, to record their great deeds, and to perpetuate their memory. Afterwards, the rector dedicated the memorial and led prayers. The hymns When I Survey the Wondrous Cross and There is a Blessed Home were sung, and buglers from the Wiltshire Regiment performed the Last Post. Rawlinson laid a laurel wreath on the memorial and relatives of the dead left flowers. Afterwards, the crowd left for the village hall, where Rawlinson officially opened the new additions."]}]}}
