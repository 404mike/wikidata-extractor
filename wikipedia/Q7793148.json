The Mayor of Newport Thomas Phillips had sworn in 500 Special Constables and asked for more troops to be sent.

Such a judgement also reflects the fact that the publication of the reports, and the controversy that followed, was the catalyst for a much greater level of nonconformist involvement in the politics of Wales than hitherto. Critics such as Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd), William Rees (Gwilym Hiraethog), Henry Richard, Thomas Price and Sir Thomas Phillips gained wide publicity for their trenchant criticisms of the reports.

He had two godfathers: actors Nigel Havers and Richard Griffiths. He attended Tower House School in London's East Sheen area, where he was a classmate of actor Robert Pattinson. He has often joked that he resented Pattinson for taking all the best acting roles in the school plays. Whitehall auditioned for the role of Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001), but the casting director was unimpressed with him because he had not read the book. His parents sent him to boarding school at the age of eight. He attended the Dragon School in Oxford and then Marlborough College.
