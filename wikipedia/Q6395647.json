After the band had enjoyed some underground success in the 1980s, including the release of their critically acclaimed \"Buffalo\" single and Quirk Out mini-album in 1986, the band signed to major label Ensign Records and began work on A Fierce Pancake in 1987. A major part of the recording process was undertaken in Berlin's famous Hansa Studios, where many of the band's favourite albums by other artists had been recorded. Recording sessions were very tense and problematic. The band initially worked with Stephen Street as engineer; he departed the sessions to work on Morrissey's Viva Hate, a decision the band would regret. Electronic pioneer Holger Hiller produced the Berlin sessions, a choice taken by bassist Kev Hopper whose recent interest in sampling and similar experimental techniques that Hiller was known for had grown, much to the other band members' disdain, who felt that Hiller and Hopper's direction was not to their liking.", "Stump formed in London in 1983. Initially featuring several line-up changes, the band settled in 1985 on the line-up of former Microdisney members Mick Lynch (vocals), Rob McKahey (drums), Kev Hopper (bass) and Chris Salmon (guitar). Becoming popular in indie circles for the band's unique, experimental sound, they built a following and released the four track EP Mud on a Colon in 1986 through the Ron Johnson record label. According to The Quietus, \"the four tracks suggest Stump came out of the womb fully formed; the beguiling m\u00e9lange of thwarted funk, traditional Irish drum rhythms (many of McKahey's time signature are concomitant with that of Irish jigs, usually performed in 12/8 time) and Lynch's lyrics, which tended to play continual tricks with the English language, piling up Surrealist imagery with a humorous scorn for syntax.\" Their song \"Buffalo\" featured on the NME's influential cassette compilation C86, featuring 22 tracks from bands within the British indie music scene, although Stump were said to stand out from the other jangle pop bands associated with the scene due to their quirky avant-garde bent.", "*Kev Hopper \u2013 bass guitar, sampler"]}, {"page": "Quirk Out", "response": ["Stump formed in London in 1983 after Irish drummer Rob McKahey left Microdisney and answered an advertisement for a singer and drummer by English musicians Kev Hopper (bass) and Chris Salmon (guitarist), who had met during the summer holidays of 1982 in Whitstable as Hopper completed his studies at the Canterbury College of Art. McKahey met with Hopper and Salmon in Peckham. McKahey recalled that at the time, the duo already had s singer, Nick Hobbs, who went on to be singer in the Shrubs, \"but in those days, I was a bit of a dickhead really. I was very assertive, very pushy and I got rid of Nick because I thought that was a gaping hole in the whole thing. And Kev and Chris were very middle-class, very quiet\u2026 but then they were coming up with this music, it was so interesting, such a challenge. We tried to get a singer for ages until eventually I persuaded [Mick Lynch,his former bandmate and vocalist in Microdisney], whom I'd seen playing in Cork, and he came down. He heard the music, went 'this is great' and we were off!\"", "Simon Bailie of Record Mirror said the album \"really set [their] taste buds off,\" noting that \"there had been some pointers to the band's talent before this, but with the benefit of a decent budget and an understanding producer, we got a lot closer to their unique vision. The unintentional racket of the early recordings had now gone, and the inspired workings of four very clever artists could now be appreciated.\" He describes that unlike before, \"you can recognize the method behind the noise attack. Kev Hopper's bass and Chris Salmon's guitar might have sounded like exploded bed springs, but that's because they wanted them to sound that way. Mick, meanwhile, sings in a hearty Cork accent about \"dandruff and farting and earwax\". Like Cathal Coughlan from Microdisney, another native of Cork, Mick has an extremely fertile imagination that often touches on the surreal.\"", "*Kev Hopper \u2013 bass guitar, sampler"]}, {"page": "Charlie Cawood", "response": ["As an art-rock band member, Cawood is the bass guitarist for Knifeworld and Lost Crowns, and a guitarist for art-pop group Tonochrome, heavy rock/prog band Khronicles and the Frank Zappa cover band Spiders of Destiny.
