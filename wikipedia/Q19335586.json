This was followed by Men in the Pits (1948), The British Worker (1952) and Women's Life and Labour. Zweig's post-war books\u2014especially The British Worker and Women's Life and Labour\u2014\"established his reputation as a social chronicler\", according to The Times. He went on to produce The Worker in Affluent Society in 1961, in which he argued that material affluence was leading to the disappearance of a \"culturally distinct working class\".Fiona Devine and Mike Savage, \"The Cultural Turn, Sociology and Class Analysis\", in Fiona Devine, Mike Savage, John Scott and Rosemary Crompton (eds), Rethinking Class: Culture, Identities and Lifestyle (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), p. 5. This became known as the embourgeoisement thesis and would later be refuted by the University of Cambridge's Affluent Worker study.Devine and Savage, pp. 5\u20136. Zweig also wrote The Student in the Age of Anxiety in 1963, and The Quest for Fellowship two years later. He produced a study of Cumbernauld New Town, questioning the rationale behind the schemes, and also, in 1976, wrote The New Acquisitive Society for the New Right Centre for Policy Studies wherein he critiqued aspects of the Welfare State. While he held visiting professorships in Israel, he produced The Israeli Worker (1959) and The Sword and the Harp (1969)."]}]}}
