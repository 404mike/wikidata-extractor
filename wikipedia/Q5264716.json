Throughout his career, Fennell repeatedly departed from prevailing norms. In the 1950s and early 1960s, with his extensive foreign travel and reporting and his travel book Mainly in Wonder, he departed from the norm of Irish Catholic writing at the time. From the late 1960s into the 1970s, in developing new approaches to the partition of Ireland and the Irish language revival, he deviated from political and linguistic Irish nationalism, and with the philosophical scope of his Beyond Nationalism: The Struggle against Provinciality in the Modern World, from contemporary Irish culture generally.\nFennell opposed the Western neo-liberal ideologies. In 1991, Fennell wrote a pamphlet challenging the prevalent critical view of Seamus Heaney as a poet of the first rank; in 2003 he wrote a small book where he revised the standard account of European history, and in 2007, his essay Beyond Vasari\u2019s Myth of Origin offered a new version of its early history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1", "response": ["Margo Harkin's Derry-set 1990 film Hush-A-Bye Baby has \"a witty scene which nevertheless offended many nationalists\": a republican youth confronts a British soldier with a disjointed mishmash of Irish-language names and phrases, ending with , only for the soldier to challenge him in fluent Irish.

The AHS has published numerous pamphlets on local history matters, often in relation to the Home Rule politician William O'Brien, the novelist Canon Patrick Sheehan, and the local poet Ned Buckley.
