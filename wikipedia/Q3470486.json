It was the third and final DreamWorks Animation film co-produced with Aardman Animations following Chicken Run (2000) and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005), and was the first Aardman project completely made in CGI animation as opposed to their usual stop-motion. The film stars the voices of Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Shane Richie, Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis, Ian McKellen and Jean Reno. In Flushed Away, a pampered pet mouse named Roddy St. James is flushed down the toilet by Sid, a sewer rat, and befriends a sewer scavenger named Rita Malone in order to get back home while evading a sinister toad and his rat henchman.", "The idea for a film about rats that fall in love in sewers was proposed by animator Sam Fell during the production of Aardman Animation's Chicken Run (2000). At the time, Aardman encouraged everyone at the company to come up with ideas for features for the DreamWorks partnership. In 2001, Fell, development executive Mike Cooper, and producer Peter Lord then developed the concept into a story before pitching it to DreamWorks. The film was first announced in July 2002, and in what was then a surprise move, it was revealed as being Aardman's very first CGI feature project. Lord described the pitch as \"The African Queen with the gender roles reversed\". After the film was announced, Comic writing duo Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were contracted to write the script, which had the working title Ratropolis. In 2003, David Bowers joined in to direct the film with Fell.", "Todd McCarthy of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying \"As directed by David Bowers and Sam Fell, first-time feature helmers with long-term Aardman affiliations, the film boasts undeniably smart and eye-catching qualities that are significantly diluted by the relentlessly frantic and overbearing behavior of most characters; someone is always loudly imposing himself upon another, to diminishing returns of enjoyment.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, saying \"Flushed Away lacks the action-contraption dottiness of a Wallace and Gromit adventure, but it hits its own sweet spot of demented delight.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"It's better than 90% of the animated fare of the last few years. It's refreshing not to have to qualify the movie's appeal by appending the words, 'for the kids'.\" Jan Stuart of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"Despite the efforts of five writers and Aardman's trademark puppets, with their malleable eyebrows and cheeks bulging like those of a mumps sufferer, none of these characters are particularly endearing.\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying \"Flushed Away, Aardman's first computer-generated cartoon, does away with the clay but leaves the craft and emotion intact, resulting in a film that earns its place among the Aardman classics.\" Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The short attention spans of directors David Bowers and Sam Fell are mostly forgivable because the movie is filled with so many entertaining characters.\"", "Category:Films directed by Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "Florida Film Critics Circle Award for Best Animated Film", "response": ["*The Tale of Despereaux || Rob Stevenhagen, Sam Fell", "* ParaNorman || Sam Fell, Chris Butler "]}, {"page": "List of animators", "response": ["* Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature", "response": ["|Flushed Away || David Bowers and Sam Fell", "| ParaNorman  || Chris Butler and Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "Annecy International Animation Film Festival", "response": ["|David Bowers and Sam Fell", "|Chris Butler and Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "34th Annie Awards", "response": ["* David Bowers & Sam Fell \u2013 Flushed Away \u2013 DreamWorks Animation & Aardman Features"]}, {"page": "60th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Flushed Away \u2013 David Bowers and Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "William Ross (composer)", "response": ["| 2008 || The Tale of Despereaux || Sam FellRobert Stevenhagen"]}, {"page": "Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Animated Film", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2012 || ParaNorman || Sam Fell and Chris Butler"]}, {"page": "Emma de Caunes", "response": ["| David Bowers & Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film", "response": ["| Flushed Away || David Bowers, Sam Fell || Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais, Simon Nye || United Kingdom, United States", "|ParaNorman  || Sam Fell, Chris Butler || Travis Knight, Arianne Sutner || United States"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2006", "response": ["| Flushed Away || Paramount Pictures / DreamWorks Animation / Aardman Animations || David Bowers, Sam Fell (directors); Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais, Chris Lloyd, Joe Keenan, William Davies (screenplay); Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Bill Nighy, Jean Reno, Shane Richie, Kathy Burke, David Suchet, Miriam Margolyes || Action, Adventure, Comedy, Family || Animation"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2008", "response": ["| The Tale of Despereaux || Universal Pictures / Relativity Media || Sam Fell, Robert Stevenhagen (directors); Gary Ross (screenplay); Matthew Broderick, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Watson, Tracey Ullman, Kevin Kline, William H.
