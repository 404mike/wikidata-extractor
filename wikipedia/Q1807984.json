His practice focuses on photography and photo-realistic paintings. Having been influenced by the psychoanalytical traditions of Freud and Jung, and scientific methods, Graff, regularly addresses in his work themes of identity, concealment, memory and a secular conception of the sacred. In-depth research led Graff to develop Alter Egos such as the scientist \u2018Professore\u2019 and the ethno-botanist Dr Albert Frique. His most extensive bodies of work are the \u2018Black Box\u2019 paintings, the \u2018Constrictions\u2019 photographic series, and the \u2018Mille-Feuille\u2019 paintings, which are made on numerous strips of wood, combining the disciplines of painting and sculpture. Graff has exhibited internationally. Selected exhibitions include: Galleria Mucciaccia, Rome (2018); Almine Rech Gallery, in London (2016); The Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Modern et Contemporain in Nice, France (2013); the Ercel Foundation in Turin, Italy (2010); the Operating Room, Amerikan Hastanesi, Istanbul (2010); the Musee de Marrakech, Morocco (2004); and the Museum of Mankind in London (1991).
