Massive inflation, combined with the GLC's \u00a31.6\u00a0billion debt, led to heavy rate increases (200% in total before the next election in 1977) and unpopular budget cuts. Some months before the 1977 elections the Labour Group began to split.

He received a knighthood in 1975. Under Bramall, Labour retained control of ILEA in 1977 despite losing the GLC election.

Led by Reg Goodwin, the GLC was dominated by Labour, who had 57 seats, compared to 33 held by the Conservatives and 2 by the Liberal Party. Of the Labour GLC members, around 16, including Livingstone, were staunch leftists. Representing Norwood in the GLC, Livingstone continued as a Lambeth councillor and Vice Chairman of the Lambeth Housing Committee, criticising Lambeth council's dealings with the borough's homeless. Learning that the council had pursued a discriminatory policy of allocating the best housing to white working-class families, Livingstone went public with the evidence, which was published in the South London Press. In August 1973, he publicly threatened to resign from the Lambeth Housing Committee if the council failed \"to honour longstanding promises\" to rehouse 76 homeless families then staying in dilapidated and overcrowded halfway accommodation. Frustrated at the council's failure to achieve this, he resigned from the Housing Committee in December 1973."]}, {"page": "Reginald Eustace Goodwin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reg Goodwin"]}, {"page": "Sir Reginald Eustace Goodwin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reg Goodwin"]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1937\u20131949", "response": ["| Reg Goodwin"]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1949\u20131965", "response": ["| Reg Goodwin", "| Reg Goodwin", "| Reg Goodwin", "| Reg Goodwin", "| Reg Goodwin*"]}, {"page": "London Labour", "response": ["|Reg Goodwin||    766,272   || 39.9% || 5.9%  ||  || 17 ||  bgcolor=#B3E0FF| Conservative win", "|Reg Goodwin||  928,034   || 47.4% || 7.5% ||  || 23  ||  bgcolor=#F8C1BE| Labour win", "|Reg Goodwin||  737,194   || 32.9% || 14.5% ||  || 30 ||  bgcolor=#B3E0FF| Conservative win"]}, {"page": "Illtyd Harrington", "response": ["In 1980, the leader of the GLC, Sir Reg Goodwin retired.
