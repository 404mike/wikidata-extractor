His early musical career included stints in Neon Hearts, who released three singles from 1977\u20131979 and the album Popular Music in 1979, and the short-lived 1982 glam rock band, Kitsch, which also included Rook Randle and Tyla, before he would go on to larger success with his band, Dogs D'Amour. In the summer of 1980 he played bass with the also short-lived Tony McPhee's Turbo. The band played a few gigs and recorded a three-track session for Capitol Radio.

Over the years the band has had various line-ups, the only constant being vocalist Tyla.  Their music has been described as a mixture of the Rolling Stones, the Faces and glam punk.", "In 1991, the band broke up onstage, before reforming briefly in the early 1990s for the release of their sixth studio album More Unchartered Heights of Disgrace. After this, however, the most famous incarnation of the band ceased to exist. There was another brief reunion in 2000 and an album, but, throughout the 2000s, Tyla has been touring and releasing albums under the band name, which is vastly different from their older material.", "In December 2012 the 'classic' line-up of Tyla, Jo 'Dog' Almeida, Steve James and Bam agreed to reform to play a series of benefit concerts for their long-time friend, and former bandmate, Paul Hornby, who was battling cancer.  Hornby died on 7 July 2015.", "The music of the Dogs D'Amour can be described as a mixture of The Rolling Stones and Faces-style blues rock and Hanoi Rocks-style glam punk. Unlike popular bands of the time, who often had misogynistic themes, the Dogs D'Amour relied more on romantic themes and a poetic lyrical style. Tyla was also a fan of Charles Bukowski, and many of his lyrics reflect Bukowski's prosaic style.", "The origins of the band can be traced to The Bordello Boys, formed in late 1982 by Tyla. An American vocalist who was staying in England at the time, Ned Christie (real name Robert Stoddard), was brought into the project and he gave the band the name The Dogs D'Amour, and co-wrote many early songs with Tyla. Guitarist Nick Halls, bass guitarist Karl Watson and drummer Bam completed the line-up.", "The Dogs D'Amour played around fifty live shows during this era and recorded on two separate sessions. On the strength on the second, the band was signed to a record deal with Kumibeat Records from Finland. However, shortly before the band was scheduled to record their first album, Christie left the band in late 1983 because of musical differences with guitarist Tyla. Another reason for the split was that Christie had recently started another band with Bam called On The Wire and had his own recording commitments scheduled with that band, around the same time that the Dogs D'Amour were due to record their own first album. The entire line-up with the exception of Tyla and Watson left the band during this time.", "===The State We're In: Tyla rebuilds the band===", "Tyla took over on lead vocals (while still playing guitar) to replace Ned Christie and recorded the band's first album, The State We're In, in early 1984.

Hornby had been a founding member of another London band, The Quireboys, earlier in the year.", "A more permanent bass guitarist was recruited by 1987. Steve James was part of what would be known as the \"classic\" Dogs line-up which also included Tyla, Jo \"Dog\" Almeida and Bam. This line-up signed a record deal with China Records in 1988.", "With the group disbanded and in shambles in Los Angeles, Bam flew back to UK and joined The Wildhearts with Ginger, CJ and Danny. Meanwhile, Tyla wrote a book of poetry. A year later the Dogs D'Amour reunited with a new line-up. Jo Almeida decided not to return to the band as guitarist; Darrell Bath was brought in to replace him. In 1993, the band recorded a new album, ...More Unchartered Heights of Disgrace. It charted well and received favourable reviews. One of the singles from the album was a cover of the Small Faces song \"All or Nothing\".", "By 1994, the Dogs D'Amour had broken up again.
