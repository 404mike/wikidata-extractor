This was followed up by a further attack by the amateurs, but R.G. Jenkins' shot went straight to Tom Farquharson in the Cardiff goal. Cardiff attacked twice in quick succession; both chances were squandered. A.H. Chadder, Frank Hartley and Jenkins moved up-field for Corinthian with some passing movement and played the ball through for Claude Ashton, but he shot wide of the post. Three corners followed for Cardiff, which were each stopped by Russell in goal for Corinthian stopped each chance. A few minutes later Len Davies headed the ball down to the feet of Ferguson, but the Cardiff player fired the ball wide of the goal despite being only a few feet away from the goal line. Just before half time, Cardiff won a direct free kick; Fred Keenor hammered the ball into a wall of Corinthian players.", "|FR || Frank Hartley"]}, {"page": "Frank Hartley", "response": ["Frank Hartley may refer to:", "* Frank Hartley (American football) (born 1967), former American football player", "* Frank Hartley (footballer) (1896\u20131965), English footballer", "* Sir Frank Hartley (pharmacist) (1911\u20131997), pharmacist and Vice-Chancellor of the University of London "]}, {"page": "1924 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||10 || Frank Hartley, Oxford City"]}]}}
