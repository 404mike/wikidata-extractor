On 25 September, the \"Valiants\" delighted their fans by recording their first league victory over rivals Stoke in 'a stirring duel' which ended 2\u20131. The following week they achieved the double over Stoke by recording a 1\u20130 victory at the Victoria Ground. This encouraged fans to travel in their numbers to see the team beat Nottingham Forest 4\u20131 at the City Ground. Injuries to Price and Brough then saw the team slump, and this continued when new signing, Manchester City goalkeeper Walter Smith was arrested for assault on the day of his debut. The arrest is likely to account for a majority of the six goals he conceded that day at South Shields. The side recovered to record heavy victories over Hull City and Stockport County, with Bobby Blood scoring six of the Vale's ten goals in the two games. Vale lost both their games to Bristol City, though Blood demonstrated his fearsome shooting power by blasting a penalty kick at City's keeper \u2013 the keeper saved the penalty to keep a clean sheet but broke his wrist in the process of saving the shot. Blood was sold to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a34,000 in February \u2013 then a club record for both clubs. The effect on the pitch was telling, as Vale went on to record just two wins in their remaining sixteen games, with a meagre six goals scored. One of the victories was a 'flash in the pan' win over FA Cup semi-finalists Cardiff City, Cardiff fielded a weakened team and watched in bewilderment as Page scored the winning goal from the penalty spot, stubbing his foot in the process.", "|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Walter Smith", "| October 1920 || GK ||  || Walter Smith || Manchester City || 'modest' || "]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["400px|thumb|(Players only) Back row: Billy Agnew, Bob Firth, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, Walter Smith", "The first team was rather unsettled throughout the campaign thanks to a bureaucratic method of selection.

A loss of \u00a34,641 was made on the season, with an economic downturn getting the blame for a shocking drop in gate receipt figures. The club even accused local paper The Sentinel of overestimating the crowd sizes. Finances were also hit by a raise in player's wages following the raising of the maximum payments limit.
