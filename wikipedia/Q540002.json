I just told him that in my opinion it was unsporting behaviour.\" An audio tape released to the press by McLaren on 11 June vindicated Dennis; according to transcribers he said to Bernoldi, \"that was not sporting and you shouldn't carry on like that.\" Bernoldi told Dennis he was following orders and was not required to allow Coulthard past since the latter was on the same lap as the former. The Arrows team principal Tom Walkinshaw rejected a claim by Dennis that Bernoldi would not permit Coulthard to pass Bernoldi for television exposure. Coulthard spoke of his belief that Bernoldi was over defensive and said he would raise the issue at the next Grand Prix Drivers' Association meeting, \"We agreed not to move once a driver has made his move. You make your decision \u2013 and up the hill a couple of times I was coming to get my wheels alongside him and he moved over.\" Bernoldi argued he was driving a routine race and was on the circuit to better his driving ability."]}, {"page": "2001 Italian Grand Prix", "response": ["The race started at 14:00 local time.
