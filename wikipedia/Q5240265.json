Art historian David Talbot Rice said that \"[Our Lady of Vladimir] ...is admitted by all who have seen it to be one of the most outstanding religious paintings of the world.\" Art historian George Heard Hamilton praises its \"craftsmanship and conception\", and notes how in its representation of the subject's faces, the icon subtly transitions from its normal use of contour lines to a refined surface texture. It is painted in an artistic style typical for Byzantine art of the period with features including smaller mouths, refined eyes, and elongating Mary's nose. However, by avoiding the use of demarcating line, as became common in later Byzantine art, and by setting up the complex interplay of the mother and child's glances, the icon adds to the illusion of life in the piece. The child's features are reminiscent of classical sculpture, though the artist renders an expression truer to an actual infant's. The expressive and humanistic character of the icon differentiates it from earlier Byzantine art and exemplify the artistic developments seen during the Komnenos dynasty."]}, {"page": "David Rice", "response": ["* David Talbot Rice (1903\u20131972), British art historian"]}, {"page": "William Gear", "response": ["He first exhibited in 1934 with the Royal Scottish Academy and Society of Scottish Artists, and his postgraduate scholarship (1936\u201337) included history of art studies with Professor David Talbot Rice at  the University of Edinburgh."]}, {"page": "World of Art", "response": ["Other authors include: John Boardman, Herbert Read, Hans Richter, Edward Lucie-Smith, Philip Rawson, David Talbot Rice, Peter Murray and Linda Murray, Germain Bazin, and Griselda Pollock."]}, {"page": "Charles Cameron (architect)", "response": ["Charles Cameron was the son of Walter Cameron, a London carpenter, speculative builderCross 1997 p. 287 and a member of the London Carpenter's Company.Colvin 2008, p. 211 He claimed descent from the Camerons of Lochiel, a Scottish clan deeply involved in the Jacobite rising of 1745. Walter Cameron was certainly friendly with Dr Archibald Cameron, the last Jacobite to be executed for his role in the '45 and a relation of Lochiel.  Walter visited Archibald shortly before his execution and may have assisted his wife and children, one of whom was named Charles.  Cameron used the Lochiel coat of arms for his personal bookplate, although modern researchers since David Talbot Rice question or deny his claims for Lochiel lineage.David Talbot Rice in his 1943 Introduction described the appearance of a modified Lochiel emblem used by Cameron and noted that \"No Charles Cameron who went to Russia is, however, known in the records of the family.
