His properties included plantations in Jamaica and Chilham Castle in Kent, England, which he sold in 1861.  The Jamaican plantation, Quebec Estate, was obtained by the Wildman family from William Beckford.  Beckford claimed to have been swindled by the Wildmans, who pressured him to sign over the property under threat of calling in outstanding mortgages.\nQuebec Estate was one of the largest sugar plantations in Jamaica with well over 800 slaves (the average at that time was 200).  The profits from this plantation allowed Thomas Wildman to purchase (and renovate) Newstead Abbey from Lord Byron.\nIn 1830, Wildman complained to Viscount Goderich about the treatment of one of his slaves, Eleanor James, by the proprietor of an estate called North Hall. (James was flogged for requesting payment for a hog.)  In 1840, Joseph John Gurney visited the estate and described the trial of a Myalist that took place there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Beckford (novelist)", "response": ["Beckford's fame, however, rests as much upon his eccentric extravagances as a builder and collector as upon his literary efforts. In undertaking his buildings he managed to dissipate his fortune, which was estimated by his contemporaries to give him an income of \u00a3100,000 a year. The loss of one of his Jamaican sugar plantations to James Beckford Wildman was particularly costly. Only \u00a380,000 of his capital remained at his death."]}, {"page": "List of slave owners", "response": ["*James Beckford Wildman (1789\u20131867), English MP and owner of Jamaican plantations.Great Britain Committee on Slavery (1833), \"Select Committee on the Extinction of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions, Report\", J.
