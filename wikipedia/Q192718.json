Leggett is widely recognised as a world leader in the theory of low-temperature physics, and his pioneering work on superfluidity was recognised by the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics. He has shaped the theoretical understanding of normal and superfluid helium liquids and strongly coupled superfluids. He set directions for research in the quantum physics of macroscopic dissipative systems and use of condensed systems to test the foundations of quantum mechanics. In a 2021 interview given to Federal University of Par\u00e1 in Brazil, Leggett talks about his early life in London, his path to become a theoretical physicist and also his scientific works and collaborations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of agnostics", "response": ["* Anthony James Leggett (born 1938): English-American physicist.
