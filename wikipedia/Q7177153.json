Springfield was uncharacteristically proud of her 1982 album White Heat, which was influenced by new wave music. She tried to revive her career in 1985 by returning to the UK and signing to Peter Stringfellow's Hippodrome Records label.

King's \"Stand by Me\". The band also performed two Marriott/Lane original compositions, a fast and loud \"Come on Children\" and the \"speed enhanced\" song \"E too D\", in which Marriott would display his considerable vocal abilities in the style of his heroes and role models, Otis Redding and Bobby Bland. \"E too D\", which appears on their first album, Small Faces, is named after the guitar chord structure. On US compilation albums the track is titled \"Running Wild\". Marriott's unique and powerful voice attracted rising attention. Singer Elkie Brooks was struck by Marriott's vocal prowess and stage presence, and recommended them to a local club owner, Maurice King. Impressed, King began finding them work in London and beyond. Their first out-of-London concert was at a working men's club in Sheffield. Since the crowd was mainly made up of Teddy boys and hard-drinking workers, the band were paid off after three songs. Despondent, they walked into the mod-orientated King Mojo Club nearby (then owned by Peter Stringfellow) and offered to perform for free. They played a set that left the local mods wanting more.

She began in series 2 as a cynical and surly personal assistant; in later series, she becomes increasingly aggressive and vindictive. There are a few occasions throughout the series when she shows sensitivity, however. Her beauty and ease in getting on with everybody when she's not being vindictive towards them makes her a key member of the team, with a weird sort of popularity, tinged with apprehension, and participates in all their schemes, sweepstakes, etc. George often remarks that she is the most-efficient production assistant GlobeLink has ever had. Joy began as a background character, intended to feed topical gags; however her popularity with audiences was such that she took an increasingly prominent role and eventually had a number of storylines of her own. Perhaps the most significant of these in terms of character development was the Series 5 episode The Graveyard Shift, in which it is revealed that her father, (already established as an alcoholic, and, according to Joy, \"wanted to be Peter Stringfellow\") abandoned the family; her mother \"went from Valium addiction to nervous breakdown to attempted suicide,\" and all of her brothers and sisters were affected by psychological problems, (except, at least in her own mind, Joy herself); her brothers are named \"Jolly\" (who is in \"Wormwood Scrubs\") and \"Happy\", (who was \"released into the care of the doorway\"), and her sister's name is \"Merrily\" (who is \"in a detox centre\"). In the final series, Joy has much of her doodled artwork put on display as she looks set to find a new career \u2013 only to discover she is being conned by the man and apparent lover behind the exhibition, and gets revenge by tying him up and exhibiting him naked at one of her art exhibitions. Her best friend from childhood is a Buddhist.
