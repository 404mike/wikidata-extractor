He was born in London at Victoria Park, Hackney. He studied at Goldsmiths College 1954\u201360 where he was taught by Mary Martin and Kenneth Martin. Lowe's work is rational, abstract and geometric. In 1960 he constructed and exhibited his first relief and experimented with balanced transformable constructions. His work is mainly exhibited and appreciated in Europe where it is in many national collections, Vienna mumok Sammlung Dieter und Gertraud Bogner, Muzeum Sztuki w Lodzi . In 1972 he cofounded Systems group. Since 1974 he has been a member of Arbeitskreis.\nThe constructivist work of Peter Lowe is mentioned in Alastair Grieve's authoritative book of 2005, and an interview with him by the art historian Alan Fowler is given in the Southampton City Art Gallery exhibition catalogue, 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geometric abstraction", "response": ["* Peter Lowe"]}, {"page": "Constructivism (art)", "response": ["*Peter Lowe \u2013 (1938\u2013)"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Hackney", "response": ["* Peter Lowe, artist, born at Victoria Park, South Hackney"]}, {"page": "Peter Lowe British Artist", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Lowe (artist)"]}, {"page": "Mathematical beauty", "response": ["The Dutch graphic designer M.

In 1961 she became the youngest member of the Constructionist group, centred on Victor Pasmore and including Adrian Heath, John Ernest, Anthony Hill, Kenneth Martin, and Mary Martin. In the 1960s her work became much more widely shown with exhibitions in London (at the Drian and Axiom galleries, the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Victoria and Albert Museum), in Chicago, and at the 1965 Tokyo Biennale and the 1969 Nuremberg Biennale.  In 1968, she gained a UNESCO Fellowship award to study in Prague, followed in 1969 by a British Council scholarship to study Russian constructivism in Leningrad. In Leningrad she met and married an architect, Adrian Ciobotaru.  In the same year she exhibited with a group of British artists in an exhibition of systems-based abstraction in Finland, followed in 1970 by her joining many of the same artists in the newly formed Systems Group and quitting the Constructionist group.  Her fellow artists in that group included Jeffrey Steele, Peter Lowe, Malcolm Hughes, Jean Spencer, Michael Kidner, John Ernest, and David Saunders. She exhibited with the group in Matrix at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol in 1970, and then in 1972, at the Whitechapel Gallery in the Arts Council's Systems exhibition.  The Arts Council also commissioned her to curate the Constructivist section of the 1978 Hayward Annual, followed in the same year by her inclusion in the Arts Council's Constructive Context show."]}, {"page": "Malcolm Hughes", "response": ["In 2008, his work featured in an exhibition at Southampton City Art Gallery alongside other constructive artists, including Peter Lowe and Mary Martin."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Goldsmiths, University of London", "response": ["*Peter Lowe (artist)"]}, {"page": "Peter Lowe", "response": ["Peter Lowe may refer to:", "*Peter Lowe (artist) (born 1938), British artist", "*Peter Lowe (surgeon) (died 1610), Scottish surgeon", "*Peter Lowe (cricketer) (1935\u20131988), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Steele (artist)", "response": ["Steele was a founder member of the Systems group of artists along with Malcolm Hughes (1920\u20131997) in December 1969.

The group arose through an exhibition of nine artists, \"Systeemi-System\", organised by Steele and his then wife, the textile designer Arja Nenonen (1936\u20132011), at the Amos Anderson Museum in Helsinki, capital of Nenonen's native Finland, in 1969. The exhibition was subtitled by Steele \"An Exhibition of Syntactic Art from Britain\", the word \"syntactic\" referring to the work \"being constructed from a vocabulary of largely geometric forms in accordance with pre-determined and often mathematically-based systems\". The Helsinki show was followed by a similar one called \"Matrix\" at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol and the 1972/3 Arts Council touring exhibition \"Systems\" which opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London in March 1972. This was followed by \"Systems II\" at the Polytechnic of Central London in 1973. Individual members showed at the Lucy Milton gallery in Notting Hill, London, up to 1975, and in continental Europe during the 1970s and afterwards. The group ceased to exist in 1976 following political disagreements, but a number of its members remained on friendly terms and exhibited together.Fowler, \"Constructive and Systems Art in Britain after the Second World War\", in the catalogue for \"Elements of Abstraction: Space Space, Line & Interval in Modern British Art\", at Southampton City Art Gallery, September 2005."]}, {"page": "British pavilion", "response": ["* 1986 \u2014 Works by Frank Auerbach (Commissioner: Henry Meyric Hughes).

During the 1960s, Spencer often produced cubes in relief form, with proportions based on a mixture of mathematical rules and her own intuition. Later in life she focussed on painting and the use of bold blocks of colour. In 1967 Spencer was a prize winner at the annual John Moores exhibition in Liverpool. Spencer exhibited with a group of British artists concerned with systems-based abstraction, the Systems Group, that included Jeffrey Steele, Peter Lowe, Michael Kidner as well as Malcolm Hughes. Her work was shown widely in Europe between 1969 and 1973 as part of various Systems Group exhibitions. In Britain, her work was included in the 1972 Arts Council touring exhibition of Systems Group artworks. During 1977 and 1978, Spencer produced a series of publications, Working Information, featuring drawings and designs by Systems Group and other Systematic-Constructive artists. She then spent a year at the University of Sussex studying the History and Theory of Art for her M.A. Spencer was an active member of the group behind the Exhibiting Space series of multi-disciplinary collaborations held in Whitechapel in 1983 and was included in the 1986 exhibition Colour Presentations at the Gardner Centre Gallery at the University of Sussex, which then toured Britain."]}]}}
