Millard had a good goalscoring record before joining Small Heath. In his three games in the Football Alliance and one in the FA Cup Millard scored three goals, but he returned to local football at the end of the 1891\u201392 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1891\u201392 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["October began with a comfortable victory, by six goals to two, at Leicester Fosse in the first qualifying round of the 1891\u201392 FA Cup.Saturday's Football.

On the Thursday, Nottingham Forest scored two second-half goals to take an end-to-end game.Football. Notts. Forest v. Small Heath .Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 9 October 1891. On the Saturday, Small Heath started the match at home to Sheffield Wednesday on a Coventry Road pitch with pools of standing water and with only nine men. Once the latecomers arrived, the home team made a better fight of it, and Arthur Millard opened the scoring early in the second half. Wednesday soon equalised, and Small Heath, down to ten men because of a leg injury to Tommy Hands, held on for a draw.Saturday's Football. The Alliance. Small Heath v. Sheffield Wednesday. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 12 October 1891. By the next Saturday, the playing surface had improved to greasy. Visitors Walsall Town Swifts scored first after about 20 minutes, which provoked Small Heath into action, and the remainder of the game was one-sided, finishing as a 4\u20131 home win. The Post heaped particular praise on the half-back line, Ollis, Jenkyns and Ted Devey, who \"worked wonders, for they not only checkmated their opponents, but fed their own forwards very judiciously, and were always ready to assist in the defence when the necessity arose.\"Notes on Sport. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 19 October 1891."]}]}}
