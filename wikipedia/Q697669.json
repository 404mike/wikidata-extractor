The game proceeded smoothly with Welch officiating effectively. Port Vale won the match (2\u20130). Two players received yellow cards, but there was little dissent apart from a vocal complaint by Harrogate's Connor Hall about a possible penalty in the first half. The announcement made Welch the first woman to be appointed to referee an English Football League game, though not the first woman to referee during a game. Amy Fearn was substituted to referee the final 20 minutes of a match between Coventry City and Nottingham Forest in February 2010 when the original referee was taken off due to injury."]}, {"page": "2021 Women's FA Cup Final", "response": ["*Fourth official: Amy Fearn (Derbyshire)"]}]}}
