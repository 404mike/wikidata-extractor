A month later, when asked about the sound of the third album, Ben Bruce explained that the band had matured and in order to excel in their career they will be recording and releasing radio friendly singles, however this will not result in the sound of the overall album as he describes the rest of the album to be \"balls-to-the-wall kind of stuff\", adding that it would be released in 2013.", "On 22 January 2015, lead singer Danny Worsnop announced his departure from the band to focus on rock music with his new band We Are Harlot.

According to Bruce, the band wanted to move on from yelling out lyrics like \"fuck\" and \"you stupid fucking whore\" to a more mature style with more meaning. He stated that From Death to Destiny is lyrically their most mature album, no longer focusing on subjects such as drugs and women, and much more meaningful than their older lyrics.
