For the most part packaging relied on standard plastic cases with a photocopied \"J-card\" insert, but some made more of an effort. Anusol by the A Band, released on the Chocolate Monk label, came packaged with a \"suppository\" unique to each copy \u2013 one of which was a used condom wrapped in tissue. The BWCD label released a cassette by Japanese noise artist Aube that came attached to a blue plastic ashtray in the shape of a fish. EEtapes of Belgium's 1995 release of This Window's Extraction 2 was packaged with an X-ray of a broken limb. The Barry Douglas Lamb album Ludi Funebres presented the cassette case in a tin, the tin filled with earth and the earth covered with leaves. Walls Of Genius went to great lengths, spray-painting abstract art on the cassette labels, affixing hand-made \"authentic\" stickers, painting cassette boxes (the \"white\" cassette, 1984), creating one-of-a-kind pinup covers (The Mysterious Case of Pussy Lust, 1985) and issuing \"Certificates of Genius\" to anybody discriminating enough to purchase one of their titles.
