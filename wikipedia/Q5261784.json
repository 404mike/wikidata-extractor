Attridge undertakes research in South African literature, James Joyce, deconstruction and literary theory and the performance of poetry. He wrote a monograph on South African writer J. M.

He says rap lyrics are made up of, \"lines with four stressed beats, separated by other syllables that may vary in number and may include other stressed syllables.

It was published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress.The Cambridge Companion to James Joyce, Derek Attridge, Cambridge University Press, 1990,", "In 1962, Clive Hart wrote the first major book-length study of the work since Campbell's Skeleton Key, Structure and Motif in \"Finnegans Wake\" which approached the work from the increasingly influential field of structuralism. However through the 1960s it was to be French post-structuralist theory that was to exert the most influence over readings of Finnegans Wake, refocussing critical attention back to the work's radical linguistic experiments and their philosophical consequences. Jacques Derrida developed his ideas of literary \"deconstruction\" largely inspired by Finnegans Wake (as detailed in the essay \"Two Words for Joyce\"), and as a result literary theory\u2014in particular post-structuralism\u2014has embraced Joyce's innovation and ambition in Finnegans Wake.A number of critical works have approached the question of the influence of Finnegans Wake on Derrida's writings and thinking, such as: Borg, Ruben (2007); The Measureless Time of Joyce, Deleuze and Derrida, London: Bloomsbury; Mahon, Peter (2007); Imagining Joyce and Derrida: Between Finnegans Wake and Glas, University of Toronto Press, ; and Roughly, Alan; Reading Derrida Reading Joyce, University Press of Florida;  Derrida tells an anecdote about the two books' importance for his own thought; in a bookstore in Tokyo,an American tourist of the most typical variety leaned over my shoulder and sighed: \"So many books! What is the definitive one? Is there any?\" It was an extremely small book shop, a news agency. I almost replied, \"Yes, there are two of them, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake.Derrida, \"Ulysses Gramophone: Hear Say Yes in Joyce\", in Derek Attridge, ed., Acts of Literature (New York: Routledge, 1992), p. 265."]}, {"page": "Scansion", "response": ["Not all prosodists agree that foot scansion is helpful.Edward Bysshe, whose Art of English Poetry was quite popular throughout the 18th century, was probably the earliest influential prosodist to deny that feet play a part in English verse. Though George R. Stewart used foot terminology to describe verse, his scansion ignored feet, concentrating instead on syntactic groupings. Most modern dissent, however, can be seen in terms of Otto Jespersen's resolute denial of the \"fallacy of the foot\" (1979, p 109); he described verse lines instead as a series of \"weak\" and \"strong\" positions, and both generative metrists and \"rhythmi-metrical\" scanners have generally followed in his anti-footsteps. Halle & Keyser (1972, p 222) dismiss the foot, their signal concept the \"Stress Maximum\" explicitly transcending (or transgressing) its boundaries. Paul Kiparsky however (a later generativist) reinstates the concept of the foot (\"Generative Metrics\" in Preminger & Brogan 1993, pp 452\u201353). Derek Attridge (1982, p 17) says, \"[a]t best, then, the division of lines into feet adds nothing, at worst it hinders accurate analysis of the metrical variations which all readers perceive.\" Alone among the \"rhythmi-metrical\" scanners Peter L. Groves reintroduces \"notional\" feet at a very general level (they figure in his verse theory but not in his actual scansions), but he distances his notion from that of traditional metrics (1998, p 107). T.V.F. Brogan (\"Foot\" in Preminger & Brogan 1993, p 419) threads the needle, saying that the foot is \"more than a mere analytic tool, a device of scansion: it is a principle of structure\" yet that it is \"not necessarily an element in poetic composition ... and it is almost certainly not an element of performance\"; and finally that \"[i]n scansion, it can be used to describe and analyze verse whose regularities support it, and not verse which does not.\"", "Slash & x: This notation is unambiguous (apart from the question of whether \"/\" indicates stress or ictus), easy to type, and frequently used. This is the notation preferred by the Poetry WikiProject for Wikipedia articles displaying scansion. It could be utilized as diacritics only using the relatively obscure x above (\"a\u036f\") or times above (\"a\u033d\") and therefore typically set in 2 lines (1 for the verse, and 1 for the scansion). This notation has been used by James McAuley, Timothy Steele, Robert B. Shaw, and the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics; and as a secondary method by Derek Attridge.", "Enid Hamer's notation has also been used by Harvey Gross and Susanne Woods, and it is the graphical basis for Derek Attridge's more complex notation (below).", "However, Jespersen did not fully integrate his notation (even to the level implied by the scansions above). It remained for the Russian linguistic-statistical school to systematize it; in their 1968 study of Russian verse, A. N. Kolmogorov and A. V. Prokhorov used a system which made both stress and ictus explicit simultaneously.Tarlinskaja 1976, pp 78\u201383; but see McAuley 1966, pp 28\u201339 for an earlier and similar, if simplified, discussion. This basic approach has subsequently been used to scan English verse by Marina Tarlinskaja, Derek Attridge, and Peter L.
