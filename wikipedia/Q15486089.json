To assist her, she was assigned a script editor\u2014initially Rodney Gedye, and then when Gedye left following clashes with Shubik,Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 153. Michael Imison. As with series one, finding suitable stories for adaptation remained a problem. On her annual visit to New York, Shubik placed an advertisement looking for stories in the Science Fiction Writers Association Bulletin. One author who answered the advertisement was Larry Eisenberg, whose stories The Fastest Draw and Too Many Cooks were commissioned. Two further adaptations, of E.M. Forster's \"The Machine Stops\" and Mordecai Roshwald's Level 7 (dramatised as \"Level Seven\"), were scripts that had been offered, without success, to film studios for some years. Another script, adapting Colin Kapp's Lambda 1, had been commissioned for series one but shelved, owing to technical considerations about how it could be realised. When special effects designer Jack Kine indicated that he had a solution to the technical challenges, the script was brought back into production for series two. Five further adaptations were commissioned: John Rankine's The World in Silence, Henry Kuttner's The Eye, Frederik Pohl's Tunnel Under the World and Isaac Asimov's \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\" and \"Reason\" (dramatised as \"The Prophet\"). Three original stories\u2014\"Frankenstein Mark II\" by Hugh Whitemore, \"Second Childhood\" by Hugh Leonard and \"Walk's End\" by William Trevor\u2014were also commissioned.", "Series two was broadcast on Thursday nights at 9:30pm, beginning with the episode \"The Machine Stops\" on 6 October 1966. The new series was promoted in listings magazine Radio Times with a front cover of \"The Machine Stops\"\u2019 star Yvonne Mitchell and an article previewing the upcoming episodes, written by Michael Imison. The two most notable productions of the series were \"The Machine Stops\" and \"Level Seven\". \"The Machine Stops\", directed by Philip Saville, was a particularly challenging production\u2014later described by Shubik as \"the most complex and technically demanding script I have ever had in my hand\"Shubik, Play for Today, p. 126.\u2014requiring large and complex sets, including construction of one with a working monorail. The effort paid off, however, as the adaptation was met with good reviews (\"A haunting film \u2013 and a deeply disturbing one\"Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 172. \u2013 The Times) and was awarded first prize at the Fifth Festival Internazionale del Film di Fantascienza (International Science Fiction Film Festival) in Trieste on 17 July 1967.Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 276.  \"Level Seven\" was adapted by J. B. Priestley and directed by Rudolph Cartier. Priestley's script had begun life as a potential screenplay for a feature film, and condensing it down to Out of the Unknown's standard running time of fifty minutes proved impossible. In the end, Shubik convinced the management of the BBC to allow \"Level Seven\" to run to sixty minutes as a one-off exceptional measure. Reviewing \"Level Seven\" in The Listener, J. C. Trewin said, \"the tension was inescapable, the excitement incontestable, more so, undoubtedly, than other thrusts into the future\".Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 198. The robot costumes created for \"The Prophet\" were later reused in the Doctor Who serial \"The Mind Robber\".", "Series two of Out of the Unknown had built on the success of the first series.

Shubik accepted the new post but insisted that she be given time to commission a full series of Out of the Unknown scripts before moving on to The Wednesday Play and handing Out of the Unknown over to a new production team.
