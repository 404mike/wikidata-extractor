His father played piano and organ, as had his father, Arthur Barrow of Buffalo, New York, a strict piano teacher and organist. When he was 13, he washed neighborhood cars until he had saved enough money to buy his first electric guitar (an Alamo) and his first amplifier (a Kent). He learned how to play music by ear by copying surf guitar records like The Ventures, and later, Jimi Hendrix, and still later, Frank Zappa. He played in local bands through junior high and high school during the 1960s. He began to study classical organ in 1970.", "While attending Alamo Heights High School, Arthur Barrow cut his musical teeth playing lead guitar in rock bands such as The Restless Ones (Jesse Childs on bass, Mike Maxwell on drums, and Jim Collins on rhythm guitar) and The Wisdom (Ian \"Toby\" French on vocals, Raymond Tolbert on bass, Tom Graham on keyboards, James Yeverino on drums, and Jim Collins on rhythm guitar) playing fraternity parties, high school dances, and small concerts in the San Antonio area. His fellow band members  knew that Arthur was \"marked for greatness\" due to his outstanding talent and ability to quickly learn songs and teach them to the other band members.
