His position is left-back.\nPearce began his career as a trainee with Aston Villa on leaving school in 1991, turning professional in June 1993, but never made a first-team appearance and signed for local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in July 1995. He only made a handful of appearances at Molineux before his transfer to Notts County in July 1997.\nPearce had far more chances at Notts County, who had just been relegated to Division Three. Manager Sam Allardyce gave Pearce a regular first-team place and his first season was a great success as he inspired County to Division Three title glory \u2013 in a historic season which saw County become the first English football team to win promotion before the end of March.\nIn four seasons at Meadow Lane, Pearce played in some 140 first-team games and was Player of the Year in his final season at the club.\nHe transferred to Peterborough United in June 2001, where due to injury and poor form he managed just 16 competitive first team games in three seasons. He joined Stafford Rangers, moving to Conference National side Northwich Victoria in September 2004. However, he was released by Northwich in December 2004 and rejoined Stafford Rangers.\nHe moved to Redditch United in the 2005 close season, moving to local rivals Worcester City in January 2006. He was released by Worcester in March 2007 and joined A.F.C. Telford United. However, he was released by Telford at the end of the season.He moved from Halesowen Town to Bromsgrove Rovers in the 2008 close season and was appointed as Rovers' captain.
