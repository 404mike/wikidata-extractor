Sit-Up's chief executive Ian Percival explained the situation by saying \"We are experimenting by using recorded video of a sale but playing it out with a live auction. The price and the quantity are live - as shown on the graphics - but the video is pre-recorded. We've only done it a couple of times before.\" A subsequent press report stated that these recorded auctions would be scrapped following complaints and a possible ASA investigation. Sit-Up's head of presentation Andy Hodgson said \"We have done it a couple of times and have no firm plans to do it again.\" However, Sit-Up's channels have in fact routinely featured these so-called \"graphic led\" pre-recorded auctions since launch. A mix-up in one of these auctions in 2002 led to a complaint being upheld by the ITC.", "* Andy Hodgson"]}, {"page": "Andy hodgson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Hodgson "]}, {"page": "1997 Bradford Bulls season", "response": ["*Round 14: Nathan Graham and Andy Hodgson scored their 1st tries for the Bulls.", "*WCC Game 5: Andy Hodgson kicked his 1st goal for the Bulls.", "|Andy Hodgson"]}, {"page": "1998 Bradford Bulls season", "response": ["|Andy Hodgson"]}, {"page": "Andrew Hodgson", "response": ["* Andy Hodgson, auctioneer/presenter on the British television shopping channel bid tv"]}]}}
