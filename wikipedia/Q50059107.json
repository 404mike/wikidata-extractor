It was only when a number of suffragists, despairing of change through peaceful means, decided to turn to militant protest that the \"suffragette\" was born. These women broke the law in pursuit of their aims, and many were imprisoned at Holloway for their criminal activity. They were not treated as political prisoners, the authorities arguing they were imprisoned for their vandalism, not their opinions. In protest, some went on hunger strike and were force fed so Holloway has a large symbolic role in the history of women's rights in the UK for those in sympathy with the movement. Suffragettes imprisoned there include Emmeline Pankhurst, Emily Davison, Violet Mary Doudney, Katie Edith Gliddon, Isabella Potbury, Evaline Hilda Burkitt, Georgina Fanny Cheffins, Constance Bryer, Florence Tunks, Janie Terrero, Doreen Allen, Bertha Ryland, Katharine Gatty, Charlotte Despard, Janet Boyd, Genie Sheppard, Mary Ann Aldham, Mary Richardson, Muriel and Arabella Scott, Alice Maud Shipley, Katherine Douglas Smith, Dora Montefiore, Christabel Pankhurst, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, Emily Townsend, Leonora Tyson, Ethel Smyth and the American Alice Paul. Detainees later received the Holloway brooch. In 1912 the anthem of the suffragettes - \"The March of the Women\", composed by Ethel Smyth with lyrics by Cicely Hamilton - was performed there."]}, {"page": "Women's Social and Political Union", "response": ["* Arabella Scott"]}, {"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["* Arabella Scott (1886\u20131980) \u2013 Scottish suffragette who endured five weeks of solitary confinement in Perth prison and force feeding twice a day"]}, {"page": "Women's Freedom League", "response": ["Suffragette sisters Muriel and Arabella Scott chained themselves to their seats at a political event and spoke out on behalf of WFL and WSPU policies, at by-election hustings across Scotland."]}, {"page": "Kelso Racecourse", "response": ["On the 19 May 1913, Edith Hudson, Arabella Scott, Agnes and Elizabeth Thomson were arrested for trying to set alight to Kelso Racecourse.

Moorhead had thrown cayenne pepper at a police constable at an event where Prime Minister Asquith was due to speak, and was taken to Methil and then Dundee prison, where she caused an amount of damage by breaking windows.  Early in 1913, she tried to write to Arabella Scott who lived at 88 Marchmont Road, Edinburgh about an incident of an amorous approach by an inebriated prison doctor, which she feared would be used as propaganda. The Dundee Gaol governor did not release it.  Again her trial resulted in some disorder from her refusal to recognise the proceedings and a sentence of \u00a320 or thirty days (which she chose). She went on hunger strike and refused to assist a medical examination, after four days,  and so she was discharged.  In another hearing in Edinburgh, Moorhead said to the judge 'I want to say this is another Court of Injustice' and (addressing Lord Chief Justice) 'you are an unjust old man'"]}]}}
