Another long-running series was Travellers' Tales, \"Adventures and misadventures, songs and stories from lands overseas, told by world-wide travellers\". After the war the Scrapbook series continued, and in 1947 \"Gilbert and Sullivan\" was first broadcast. It was billed as \"a radio biography in six parts\", and featured Carleton Hobbs as narrator, with D. A. Clarke-Smith as W. S. Gilbert and Ivan Samson as Arthur Sullivan; the music was performed by singers including Gwen Catley, Sylvia Cecil, Mary Jarred, Winifred Lawson, Charles Heslop and Richard Lewis, conducted by Stanford Robinson. In preparing the script Baily had many conversations with people who had known Gilbert and Sullivan, including Nancy McIntosh, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, and Newman Flower.\"Gilbert and Sullivan\", Radio Times, 19 September 1947, pp. 3 and 6 The series was remade in 1949, with Charles Groves succeeding Robinson as conductor.
