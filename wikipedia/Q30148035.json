It starred Cunningham as handyman Simon Bodger and his talking badger companion. The programme was spawned from some appearances the double act made in 1988 as part of the Saturday morning BBC1 children's programme On the Waterfront.Hayward, Anthony. \"Andy Cunningham obituary\", The Guardian, London, 12 June 2017. Retrieved 27 June 2017.", "The programme had a memorable theme song sung by children. The music was composed by Peter Gosling and the lyrics written by Andy Cunningham. Various edits of the song were used over the years, with the full version used on the end credits of some episodes from 1989 to 1991.", "*Simon Bodger (Andy Cunningham) - Simon Bodger is a handyman who has had various jobs throughout the series. However he is of a nervous disposition which causes him to be clumsy, make silly mistakes (including many misunderstandings) and from the trouble that comes from Badger's antics, he repeatedly keeps getting sacked. In the first series he was working as a cook for Troff's Nosherama. He got sacked after Badger accidentally revealed himself to praise Mr Troff for giving Simon the job of chef. In the second and third series he was a caretaker at the Letsby Avenue Junior School. This is not far from Troffs' Nosherama, as the Letsby Avenue football team are referenced in the first episode of series one. In the fourth series he was a handyman and zookeeper at Chessington World of Adventures. In the fifth, sixth and seventh series he was seemingly unemployed and renting a flat, occasionally working as a casual handyman to his landlady, Mrs Dribelle. In the eighth and ninth series he was temporary manager of a Bed and Breakfast while a relative who owned it went on a round-the-world trip. All businesses Bodger worked for are, of course, fictional. Badger is his anthropomorphic talking pet and best friend, although all the trouble that Bodger ends up in is usually down to Badger. Regular gags usually involve Badger covering Bodger in mashed potato or some other messy substance, either intentionally or accidentally.", "*Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, operated by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger is named after what he is - a badger (although he often responds to being called \"Badge\"). He is anthropomorphic - he has the ability to talk (with a South London accent) and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, his laugh sounds like that of the boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's continual childlike inability to behave himself that gets him into trouble with Simon, with Simon having not only to take the blame for many of Badger's antics, but also to try and keep Badger's existence a secret. Nevertheless, Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out in every way he can, although Badger usually misunderstands a situation or can take things literally. Despite this, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger. For example, he will eat various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19\u00a0mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location. He has many catchphrases (mostly South Londoner and Cockney slang, although he never uses rhyming slang) including (but not limited to): shouting \"MASHED POTATO\" when he comes across his favourite food and using the word  \"wotcha\" when greeting someone. He will also use hippy slang when expressing admiration for something, using expressions such as \"far out!\", \"cosmic!\" and \"groovy!\". When expressing an emotion he frequently follows the word (sometimes slang expressions) for said emotion with \"potatoes\", e.g. \"soppy potatoes\" or \"sad potatoes\" and he is frequently heard singing the words \"mashed potato\" to the melody of football chant Here We Go, e.g. \"Maaaaashed po-tay, mashed potay, mashed potay-ay-ay, mashed potay, mashed potay, mashed potayyyy-to\".", "*China - A dog originally owned by the Hutchins family in Series 8 but later belongs to Millie in Series 9. It is unknown how he became Millie's pet or why he is no longer with the Hutchins. He worked with Badger and Mousey to cause chaos with mashed potato around Puddleford. He likes annoying Mrs Melly by barking loudly outside her office. Of the three puppets used in the series, China is the first that puppeteer Andy Cunningham got, claiming to have bought him at a magician's show in Brighton in the 1970s. He is a \"Benji the Adorable Puppy\" puppet, whom Andy christened \"China\" following Cockney rhyming slang (\"China\" being short for \"china plate\", meaning \"mate\"). However, of the three that were used on the series, China was the only one purchased ready-made - all versions of Badger and Mousey were made for Andy Cunningham by a personal friend of his. Before Bodger and Badger, Andy used China in children's party acts he used to perform in the London area, while another puppet he owned (also made for him by the same person who made the Badger and Mousey puppets), a foul-mouthed talking rat called Magritte (which never appeared in the series) would be used for entertaining at events where a more adult audience was in attendance. Again, China (and Magritte) used googly eyes.", "*Andy Cunningham - Creator / Writer of most of the episodes.", "Andy Cunningham revealed in an interview for a book that Bodger and Badger ended its ten-year run in 1999 when the Head of BBC Children's Programmes - Christopher Pilkington (who had commissioned the show in 1989 and championed it since then) - left his post and the programme was not renewed by his successors - Andy said that he was not surprised by this, but he didn't reveal why. He mentioned that he didn't mind this anyway as he said he was struggling for inspiration for things to do with mashed potato towards the end of the show's run.
