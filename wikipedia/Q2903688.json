O'Neill was capped eleven times for the Wales rugby union national team, and twice for the Wales national league team. Although playing throughout the 1904/1905 season, he missed the classic 1905 Wales win over the Original All Blacks. He is often registered in many sources under the name Billy Neill or Neil because the Welsh Rugby Union didn't want him to sound like he was Irish.", "link_mentions": {}}}
