At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives. Meanwhile, Henry Drummond, Member of Parliament for the West Surrey constituency which covered the Brookwood site, James Mangles, MP for the nearby constituency of Guildford, and labour reform campaigner Lord Ashley (later Lord Shaftesbury) lobbied against the proposal. Drummond considered the scheme a front for land speculation, believing that the promoters only intended to use  for the cemetery and to develop the remaining 80% for building; Mangles felt that the people of Woking were not being fairly compensated for the loss of their historic rights to use the common lands; Ashley felt that the Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 had been a victory for the campaign to end private profiteering from death and that the new scheme would reverse these gains, and was also concerned about the health implications of diseased bodies being transported to and stored at the London terminus in large numbers while awaiting trains to Brookwood.", "Owing to Henry Drummond's concerns in 1852 that the LNC was a front for land speculation, the sale of LNC-owned land for building had been expressly forbidden by the Act of Parliament establishing the LNC, and consequently much of the land not in use for burials remained undeveloped, aside from the land sold in the 1850s and 1860s, and the areas sold by Cyril Tubbs."]}, {"page": "Plymouth Brethren", "response": ["An important early stimulus was the study of prophecy, which was the subject of a number of annual meetings at Powerscourt House in County Wicklow starting in 1831.

Early in 1822, his preaching in London so impressed the banker and parliamentarian Henry Drummond (1786\u20131860) that Drummond appointed M\u2018Neile to the living of the parish of Albury, Surrey, from where M\u2018Neile's first collection of sermons, Seventeen Sermons, etc., were published in 1825.", "From 1826 to 1830, Drummond hosted the annual Albury Conferences,Albury parish website: Brief History of Albury. held in Albury for the Union of the Students of Prophecy moderated by M\u2018Neile.According to Flegg (1992, pp.3 7\u201338), apart from M\u2018Neile, the participants included the clerics Henry Forster Burder (1783\u20131864), William Hodgson Cole (1806\u20131852), William Dodsworth (1798\u20131861), William Dow (1800\u20131855), Edward Irving (1792\u20131834), William Marsh (1775\u20131864), Henry John Owen (1795\u20131862), John Simons (1754\u20131836), John Haldane Stewart (1766\u20131854), Robert Story (1790\u20131859), Edward Thomas Vaughan (1777\u20131829), Daniel Wilson (1778\u20131858) and Joseph Wolff (1795\u20131862); and the laymen, John Bayford (1774\u20131844), Thomas William Chevalier (1799\u20131835), Henry Drummond (1786\u20131860), John Hookham Frere (1769\u20131846), James Gambier (1756\u20131833), Charles Robert Malden (1797\u20131855), Viscount Mandeville (1799\u20131855), Spencer Perceval (1795\u20131859), John James Strutt (1796\u20131873) and John Owen Tudor (1783\u20131861). Each of the Albury Conferences involved days full of close and laborious study of the prophetical books of the Bible; attempting to seek out as-yet-unfulfilled prophecies within them.

Irving was a strong believer in the \"gifts\" of \"speaking in tongues\" (glossolalia) and spiritual healing. It was through Irving that M\u2018Neile first encountered the Irish-born Okey Sisters. His experience of the deception of Okey Sisters' reputed speaking in tongues with Irving, and his knowledge of their later association with Elliotson and his mesmerism, and their well-attested fraudulent deception of Elliotson, must have strongly informed his later views of the activities of magnetists such as Lafontaine.For a detailed treatment of Jane and Elizabeth Okey, see pp.155\u2013194 in Clarke, J.

They believed in the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, in preparation for which they resolved to re-establish the early-Church offices of apostles, prophets, etc. Besides enthusiasm, the new congregations looked for order, too. Through the prophecy of members, apostles were called forth and, after further callings, some men were sent to various ministries. The first \"apostle\" (J. B. Cardale) was called in 1832. He became the principal liturgist and \"Pillar of Apostles\". In 1833 Henry Drummond became the second \"apostles\", and was later assigned responsibility for Scotland and Switzerland. Within two years the church's prophets called forth 12 apostles, equivalent to the original 12 apostles of the New Testament. The full college of 12 held their first council in 1835.

In response, Isabella and Mary Campbell of the parish of Rosneath manifested charismatic experiences such as speaking in tongues. Around 1830, miraculous healings were reported through James Campbell, first of his sister Margaret MacDonald and then of Mary Campbell (through James's letter to Mary). Shortly thereafter, James and George MacDonald manifested the speaking and interpretations of tongues, and soon others followed suit in prayer meetings. These charismatic experiences garnered major national attention. Many came to see and investigate these events. Some, such as Edward Irving and Henry Drummond, regarded these events as genuine displays from the Holy Spirit.
