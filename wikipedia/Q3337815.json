Reviewers enjoyed Master Chief's return as the protagonist, and the emotional connection between Master Chief and Cortana was highly praised. Mike Mahardy of Game Informer complimented the characterization improvements of Chief and Cortana, calling their evolved love story more \"focused\" and \"relatable\" to the player, in comparison to the \"cloudy and impersonal\" stories from the prior games of the franchise. GameSpot editor, Chris Watters, described the \"thrilling and emotional return of Master Chief and Cortana\" as the highlight of the game. GamesRadar maintained that the narrative was enthralling and the campaign's structure was much better than its predecessors. IGN's McCaffrey praised the game's lighting, movements, animations, and lauded the campaign for its pacing, \"deftly mixing on-foot combat, vehicle sequences, quiet story moments, and key Chief-and-Cortana interactions.\" Although Neil Davidge's work on the musical composition was noted as a \"bold shift\", McCaffrey claimed the music seemed \"complementary rather than additive.\"", "1UP.com reviewer Jose Otero was critical of Halo 4s story, writing that the ending of the game \"doesn't make a lot of sense\". He also remarked that while the narrative tied the main plot lines together well, it was disappointing to see some of the smaller story points were ignored entirely. Both G4 and Official Xbox Magazine agreed that the plot became convoluted on occasions and might be difficult to understand for new players of the franchise. G4 reviewer, Adam Rosenburg, also stated that while the soundtrack had some memorable moments, he was disappointed that composer Neil Davidge had chosen to ditch the familiar theme of previous games. Michael Gapper of Computer and Video Games drew a comparison between Halo 4 and Halo 2. He stated that the hardware limitations of the Xbox 360 had negatively impacted Halo 4s campaign, in the same way that they had throttled Bungie's ambitions for Halo 2 on the original Xbox. He explained that although the game was visually stunning, this had detracted from the scale and spectacle that was present in Halo 3s campaign. He found the spaces within the campaign to be narrow and constrained which led to a lack of tactical options in encounters.", "Category:Video games scored by Neil Davidge"]}]}}
