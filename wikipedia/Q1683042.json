He was one of an established family of stage magicians, the son of Nevil Maskelyne and a grandson of John Nevil Maskelyne. He is most remembered for his accounts of his work for the British military during the Second World War, in which he claimed to have created large-scale ruses, deception, and camouflage in an effort to defeat the Nazis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Zenon", "response": ["He is the author of three books on magic, proposition bets and practical jokes, and an expert on the history of magic and magicians, variety, and unusual entertainments.

He is a sceptic with strong views on claims of psychic abilities and the paranormal."]}, {"page": "Lake Mariout", "response": ["* Jasper Maskelyne claimed in Magic-Top Secret (1949) to be involved in the construction of a decoy site next to the lake to draw Axis bombers away from attacking Alexandria Harbour during World War Two."]}, {"page": "Edenbridge, Kent", "response": ["* Jasper Maskelyne (1902-1973), magician, grew up in Edenbridge."]}, {"page": "Misdirection (magic)", "response": ["The performer can direct the audience's attention in various ways. In the book, The Secret Art of Magic, authors Eric Evans and Nowlin Craver posit that magic is directly related to warfare, and relies on the same principles for success. They reference Sun Tzu's Art of War to show how deception is essential to any successful campaign. Craver goes on to illustrate, through the 36 strategies,The 36 Strategems how they form a blueprint for every known method of misdirection.  In World War II, British military intelligence employed stage magician Jasper Maskelyne to help devise various forms of misdirection such as ruses, deception, and camouflage."]}, {"page": "MI9", "response": ["MI9 used the services of former magician Jasper Maskelyne to design hiding places for escape aids including tools hidden in cricket bats and baseball bats, maps concealed in playing cards and actual money in board-games.

Aircraft and buildings were made of cardboard and wood and some real, but old tractors were driven around the site. The Germans attacked the dummy field a number of times and it was rebuilt each time."]}, {"page": "Operation Bertram", "response": ["Barkas and Ayrton went out onto the beach dunes to sit and think. Barkas recalled the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By the end of that afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.", "The note was passed to Barkas, in his words \"not long after my arrival in Middle East... The whole idea was there. It was only a matter of design, development, and arrangements for manufacture.\" The first heavy wooden prototype was made in 1941 by Jasper Maskelyne, who gave it the name Sunshield.Stroud, 2010. pp80-81. 12 men were needed to lift it, and it disintegrated on its first trial run on a Crusader tank. However, Barkas had enough confidence in the Sunshield to ask for a lighter version. The Mark 2 Sunshield was made of canvas stretched over a light steel tube frame. It was strong, light, and cheap to manufacture. And crucially, from as low as 500 feet, RAF pilots found that the Mark 2 convincingly resembled a truck."]}, {"page": "Indian rope trick", "response": ["There has long been skepticism regarding the trick.Mulholland, John.

But mankind has always had an instinctive urge to manufacture the myth that it exists.\"Pritchard, William Thomas. (Will Dexter [pseud]). (1958). This is Magic: Secrets of the Conjurer's Craft. Citadel Press. p. 83 \"Many magicians have devised apparatus to perform the Indian Rope Trick on a stage. But, as Jasper Maskelyne says, that's not quite the same trick as the one that's been created in myth and legend. Other illusionists have successfully staged the trick out of doors, but under those circumstances, a demonstration of pole balancing has been all they could offer to the spectators. No magician has yet sent a small boy up a rigid rope and caused him to vanish at the top, or to fall to the ground dismembered.\"Christopher, Milbourne. (January, 1959). The Greatest Magic Illusions Of All Time. Part 2.

Maskelyne never demonstrated his method, but offered \u00a32,000 to anyone who could perform the full trick in open space. Nobody ever claimed this reward and he considered the full trick to be a myth, never successfully demonstrated.Maskelyne, Jasper. (2009 edition, originally published in 1936).

Coupled with explosives that simulated German bombs landing on the city, Maskelyne's illusion caused German planes to release their ordnance on the empty coastal site he had prepared rather than on the city."]}]}}
