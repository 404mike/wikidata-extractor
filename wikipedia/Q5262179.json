It was the time of day during the week when children could be expected to be home from school, and was aimed at an audience aged about 5 to 15 years.  Programming was imbued with Reithian virtues, and Children's Hour was often criticised, like \"Auntie\" BBC itself, for paternalism and middle-class values. It was nonetheless hugely popular, and its presenters were national figures, their voices instantly recognisable.  Derek McCulloch was closely involved with the programme from 1926, and ran the department from 1933 until 1950, when he had to resign for health reasons. From 1928 to 1960, Children's Hour in Scotland was organised and presented by Kathleen Garscadden, known as Auntie Kathleen, whose popularity brought crowds to the radio station in Glasgow.W. H.
