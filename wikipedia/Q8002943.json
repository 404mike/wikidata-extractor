The players recruited from Scotland during the previous summer had failed to live up to expectations and the majority of them were released; only Calder and Robertson were retained. Billy Bridgewater and Edward Cross were signed from nearby Rotherham Town, and Harry Lilley arrived from Staveley during the close season, but the Blades persisted with their policy of utilising guest amateur players from the local area."]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["United continued to add to the squad, signing keeper Will Lilley from Staveley, before registering a string of victories until the end of the year, culminating in a 6\u20130 win over Stockton at the end of December.  The league then took a winter break of almost three months, not resuming until almost the end of March.  The club continued to strengthen their attacking options by recruiting three additional forwards from Scotland; Sandy Wallace, John Scott and resigning former player James Duncan.  William Calder and Harry Munro were both allowed to join Gainsborough Trinity, before United resumed their league campaign with a 4\u20133 loss away at Newcastle West End who were struggling at the bottom of the table.  This signalled a down\u2013turn in form and inconsistent results until the end of the season meant that United lost touch with the top of the table and eventually finished third."]}, {"page": "List of English association football families", "response": ["* Harry Lilley, Will Lilley (brother)"]}]}}
