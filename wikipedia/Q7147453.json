By 1933, he had attracted the attention of German officials because of his criticism of the political situation in Germany, and on 10 May 1933, Wells's books were burned by the Nazi youth in Berlin's Opernplatz, and his works were banned from libraries and book stores.Patrick Parrinder and John S. Partington (2005). The Reception of H. G. Wells in Europe. pp. 106\u2013108. Bloomsbury Publishing. Wells, as president of PEN International (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), angered the Nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN's refusal to admit non-Aryan writers to its membership. At a PEN conference in Ragusa, Wells refused to yield to Nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author Ernst Toller be prevented from speaking. Near the end of World War II, Allied forces discovered that the SS had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned Operation Sea Lion, with Wells included in the alphabetical list of \"The Black Book\".Wells, Frank.

The \"New Wave\" writing of the 1960s, with its fragmented and surrealistic forms, has not made a lasting impact, because it cast its net too wide.

Some definitions of sub-types of science fiction are included, too; for example see David Ketterer's definition of \"philosophically-oriented science fiction\".

It does not necessarily entail realistic speculation about a future world, though its bias is undoubtedly realistic.  Rather, this is the sort of SF that most appeals to scientists themselves\u2014and is often written by them.  The typical 'hard' SF writer looks for new and unfamiliar scientific theories and discoveries which could provide the occasion for a story, and, at its more didactic extreme, the story is only a framework for introducing the scientific concept to the reader.\""]}, {"page": "Science fiction studies", "response": ["* Patrick Parrinder"]}, {"page": "Outline of science fiction", "response": ["* Definitions of science fiction: Science fiction includes such a wide range of themes and subgenres that it is notoriously difficult to define.For example, Patrick Parrinder comments that \"[d]efinitions of science fiction are not so much a series of logical approximations to an elusive ideal, as a small, parasitic subgenre in themselves.\"   Accordingly, there have been many definitions offered.
