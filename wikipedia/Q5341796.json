He has had top 30 success as a songwriter with hits including \"It's a Fine Day\" (Opus III) - the tune of which was then used in Kylie Minogue's hit \"Confide in Me\" - \"Halcyon\" (Orbital) and \"Happiness\" (Pizzaman).

The opening part of the track features an arrangement by musician Will Malone and a piano section by Anderson, which was performed on a B\u00f6sendorfer. English musician Edward Barton is credited as a co-writer under the name Owain Barton, along with Anderson and Seaman, because of the interpolations from his song \"It's a Fine Day\" (1983). Lyrically, the content talks about Minogue's earnest seduction and manipulating people to confide into her. \"Surrender\" is a seductive slow jam track, with Balearic pop, jazz and R&B-influences, which Cinquemani compared to a less sensual rendition of songs recorded by Tia Carrere for Dreams (1993). Levine felt that the slinky mid-tempo pop-funk \"If I Was Your Lover\" showcases Minogue's \"genuine strength in depth\". Frankie Knuckles and David Morales' classic musical elements influenced Anderson when he produced Minogue's cover of \"Where Is the Feeling?\". The producers added live piano, guitar and percussion to the album's version of the song. The disco and acid jazz-based track was compared with the work of British acts such as The Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai and Incognito.", "* \"Confide in Me\" contains interpolations of \"It's a Fine Day\", written by Edward Barton.
