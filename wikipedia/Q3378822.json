The largely left-wing audience responded to the work enthusiastically;Hall, p. 133 Tippett observed that \"to counter the radical tendencies of the finale ... Boult forced the applause to end by unexpectedly performing the National Anthem\". A performance of the concerto a year later, at the 1939 \"Festival of Music for the People\", drew caustic comments from Neville Cardus in  The Manchester Guardian.
