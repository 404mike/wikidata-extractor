He was one of several players to be given the chance to represent Derbyshire on the restart of the County Championship. He made a fair impact during his debut season of 1946, making one half-century.  In the three seasons following his debut, he hit two half-centuries per season and bowled 6 for 37 against Northamptonshire in 1947.\nMarsh was a left-handed batsman and played 109 innings in 66 first-class matches with an average of 18.28 and a top score of 86. He was a slow left-arm bowler and took 44 first-class wickets at an average of 38.59 and with a best performance of 6 for 37.Marsh died at Derby at the age of 82. His uncle was Stan Worthington, nine-time Test cricketer and Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1937.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Derbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1946", "response": ["The club retained a nucleus of pre-war players, and Pat Vaulkhard, a future captain, had previously played for Nottinghamshire. Alan Revill, Eric Marsh,  John Eggar and Roy Genders all began their first-class career during the season, although some had already played for the club in miscellaneous matches during the war. England footballer Raich Carter turned out for Derbyshire at cricket. However newcomers Walter Fullwood and Jack Pearson did not play beyond the end of the season, and John Tomlinson only played one match for the club in 1946."]}, {"page": "Charles Posnett", "response": ["Posnett was born at Belfast and was educated in the city at Connell's Institute. A club cricketer for Woodvale and Downpatrick, he made one appearance in first-class cricket for Ireland against Derbyshire at Buxton during Ireland's 1947 tour of England. Batting twice during the match, he joint top scored with 26 runs alongside Stuart Pollock, before being dismissed by Dusty Rhodes, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for 20 runs by Eric Marsh. All six of his appearances for Ireland came in 1947, with Posnett also featuring in five minor fixtures, including three matches against the touring South Africans played at Belfast and Dublin. Outside of cricket, Posnett worked as a council sanitary official. He died at Belfast in August 1997."]}, {"page": "Marsh, Eric", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eric Marsh (cricketer, born 1920)"]}, {"page": "Eric Marsh", "response": ["Eric Marsh may refer to:", "* Eric Marsh (cricketer, born 1920) (1920\u20132003), English cricketer", "* Eric Marsh (cricketer, born 1940) (1940\u20132017), English first-class cricketer and educator"]}]}}
