Their similarities beyond the name include wielding a sword and fighting for a cauldron (in Preiddeu Annwn and Culhwch). T. Gwynn Jones claimed links between Lancelot and  Eliwlod, a nephew of Arthur in the Welsh legend. Proponents of the Scythian origins of the Arthurian legend have speculated that an early form might have been Alanus-\u00e0-Lot, that is \"Alan of the Lot River\", while those looking for clues in antiquity see elements of Lancelot in the Ancient Greek mythical figures of Askalos and Mopsus (Moxus)."]}, {"page": "Berwyn range", "response": ["The scholar T.

In many ways a \"late starter\", for he did not publish his first volume of poetry until he was in his early 50s, he at once became notable for the way in which he developed the traditional metres of Welsh poetry. Compared by some with the writing of T. Gwynn Jones, who was also seen as a moderniser of Welsh prosody,Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales, 1986, OUP. Bowen's early work (collected in Cerddi - Poems - 1957) is dense with layered imagery, and whilst later on he moved into free verse, it is actually difficult to chart his development in a linear way.Jones, G. & Rowlands J, 1980. Profiles: an Account of Welsh and English Language Writers in Wales Today, Llandyssul: Gomer. Although the work in his first book is rich with form and form experiment, his second; Cerddi Rhydd (Free Verses, published 1961) dispenses with all formal devices and is made up of prose proems in the manner of Rimbaud. Not only was Bowen responsible for bringing into Welsh poetry influences from mainland Europe which effectively revolutionised the medium - in this he is in many ways to Welsh literature what T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound were to English - he is also of considerable interest in British poetry because his work with prose poems anticipates that of Geoffrey Hill (in Mercian Hymns) by a clear decade.Hill, G. 1985, Collected Poems. London: Viking Although there are some skeins in his work which are reminiscent of Symbolism (he translated a selection of French Symbolist poets into Welsh) and of a kind of Imagism, Bowen always thought of himself as a Sacramentalist  and believed the images in his poems communicated as signs. Comparable in stature with his fellow priest-poet R. S. Thomas, Bowen is, nevertheless, considerably more celebratory in tone, and the transformations in nature, as he sees them, often appear as communicating a personal revelation."]}, {"page": "Chairing of the Bard", "response": ["| 1902 || Bangor ||  || data-sort-value=\"Jones, T.
