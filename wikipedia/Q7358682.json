Marsh scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 4\u20130 win over Middlesbrough. He scored 44 goals in 53 games as the club became Third Division champions; his 30 league goals made him the division's top-scorer. QPR also won the League Cup, with Marsh setting Rangers on their way with four goals during a 5\u20130 victory over Colchester United at Layer Road. They needed a replay to overcome Aldershot, before they beat Swansea Town, top-flight Leicester City, Carlisle United and Birmingham City. Their opponents in the Wembley final were West Bromwich Albion, who had won the cup the previous year. The \"Baggies\" took a two-goal lead before half-time, but Rangers fought back in the second half and on the 75th minute Marsh scored what he described as \"the defining goal of my career\" when he made a mazy run past numerous defenders before finding the net with a 25-yard shot that went in off the post. Lazarus scored QPR's third goal six minutes later to win the game 3\u20132. A week after the final Tottenham Hotspur manager witnessed Marsh put in a strong performance against Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic and he offered to pay QPR \u00a3180,000 for Marsh and Morgan, but his offer was rejected by chairman Jim Gregory."]}, {"page": "Alec Stock", "response": ["It was perhaps Stock's time as manager of Queens Park Rangers where he is most fondly remembered.

They were one goal down at half time, and again were forced to recover the deficit during the second half. In the 55th minute, Marsh scored his 34th goal of the season, he headed the ball into the goal after a corner kick from Allen. Marsh was involved again in QPR's second and third goal as he set up Roger Morgan for the second, and then back heeled the ball through to Lazarus for the third. QPR's fourth and final goal saw Marsh hit a header direct from a free kick to Allen who scored.  The second leg secured QPR's first trip to Wembley, and marked the first time that a team from the Third Division had reached any Wembley final. They won the game 3\u20131, but they did not score until the last twelve minutes of the match. ", "The teams came out for the second half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan released Allen but he was not quick enough to make something of the chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.Macey (2009): p. 188", "| FW ||11||\u00a0Roger Morgan"]}, {"page": "Morgan (surname)", "response": ["*Roger Morgan (1946) English footballer, QPR, Tottenham."]}, {"page": "History of Queens Park Rangers F.C.", "response": ["In 1966\u201367, QPR won the Division Three championship and also became the first Third Division club to win the League Cup, when on Saturday, 4 March 1967, they defeated West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132, (coming back from a two-goal deficit).
