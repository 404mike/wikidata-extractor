He scored twice on his debut in Crawley's first game of the 2007\u201308 season, a 2\u20131 home win against Stevenage. The following week, Madjo scored again, this time in a 4\u20131 away loss at Salisbury City. In September 2007, Madjo scored in five consecutive fixtures, including a brace in a 5\u20133 home win against Woking. He also scored twice within the space of a week in October 2007, scoring in away fixtures against Kidderminster Harriers and Weymouth respectively. Madjo had scored 11 goals in 18 games, which prompted speculation regarding a move into the Football League. Madjo said \"It is nice to have people say good things about you but at the moment I'm not thinking about other clubs. All I think about is doing my job and doing my best for Crawley\". On 21 November 2007, four days after earning a call up to the Cameroon squad, Madjo joined League One side Cheltenham Town on a one-month loan, with a view to a permanent move. On Madjo's departure, Crawley Town manager Steve Evans said \"As a manager, I'm extremely disappointed. As a club, we always knew this day would come. He's an exceptional talent and a model professional\". Madjo made his Cheltenham debut on 25 November 2007, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in Cheltenham's \"shock\" 1\u20130 home victory over Leeds United. He started his first game three weeks later, a 1\u20130 win against Luton Town. During his one-month loan spell, Madjo made five appearances for Cheltenham. Despite impressing Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, the club opted against buying the player on a permanent basis as a result of Downing having more funds at his disposal \u2013 \"Madjo had done nothing but impress all those at Cheltenham, but thanks to the extra money made available to Keith Downing, Cheltenham have set their requirements higher\"."]}, {"page": "List of Old Edwardians (Sheffield)", "response": ["* Tyrone Thompson (born 1981) \u2013 footballer with Torquay United"]}, {"page": "2006 Conference National play-off Final", "response": ["The second half saw more of the same with both sides having the upper hand at different stages.
