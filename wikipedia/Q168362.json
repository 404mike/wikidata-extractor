Her works have sparked debate in primatology, philosophy, and developmental biology.Kunzru, Hari. \"You Are Cyborg\", in Wired Magazine, 5:2 (1997) 1-7. Haraway participated in a collaborative exchange with the feminist theorist Lynn Randolph from 1990 to 1996. Their engagement with specific ideas relating to feminism, technoscience, political consciousness, and other social issues, formed the images and narrative of Haraway's book Modest_Witness for which she received the Society for Social Studies of Science's (4S) Ludwik Fleck Prize in 1999. She was also awarded with the Section on Science, Knowledge and Technology's Robert K. Merton award in 1992 for her work Primate Visions:Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science.  In 2000, Haraway was awarded the Society for Social Studies of Science's John Desmond Bernal Prize for her distinguished contributions to the field of science and technology studies.
