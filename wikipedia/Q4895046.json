He made 220 appearances (148 in the Football League) and scored 40 goals (14 in the Football League) for Port Vale over about ten seasons with the club. He established himself as a regular first team player, but had spells of inconsistency which left him out of the side for large periods. Ever the loyal Valiant, it is believed he did not join another team in 1907 when the club suffered financial meltdown and liquidation, instead he re-signed in December 1908 and went straight into the first team. He left for good in the summer of 1910.", "link_mentions": {}}}
