He made 220 appearances (148 in the Football League) and scored 40 goals (14 in the Football League) for Port Vale over about ten seasons with the club. He established himself as a regular first team player, but had spells of inconsistency which left him out of the side for large periods. Ever the loyal Valiant, it is believed he did not join another team in 1907 when the club suffered financial meltdown and liquidation, instead he re-signed in December 1908 and went straight into the first team. He left for good in the summer of 1910.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["Burslem Port Vale were awaiting liquidation and were no longer in operation, eventually being wound up in 1909. The club's history would have ended at this point, had it not been for an unexpected twist. North Staffordshire Church League champions Cobridge Church were accepted into the North Staffordshire Federation League, still a very minor league. Joint-secretaries Millward and E.C.Brundrett had very big ambitions however. In 1907, they sought permission from the Football Association to change the club's name to Port Vale and bought the old club's ground (the Athletic Ground). To signify their roots they renamed their reserve side to Cobridge Church. Port Vale were now playing teams such as Leek United, Newchapel United and Ashwood Villa. However their fifth-placed finish encouraged the club to apply, successfully, for membership of the North Staffordshire & District League. Financial pressures soon affected the lowly club, and in December 1908, former Vale player Sam Bennion led a buy-out consortium. Former players Adrian Copes, Bert Eardley and Harry Croxton were re-signed and the future looked bright.", "In 1909\u201310 the club won the North Staffordshire & District League, but lost key players such as Joe Brough (to Liverpool), Billy Cavenor (to Blackpool) and Bert Eardley (to Glossop). On 21 July 1911, the club re-organised, with J.H.Edwards elected chairman. The club also stepped up to the Central League. Facing another financial crisis, coupled with numerous issues with their Cobridge Ground, Vale transferred to The Old Recreation Ground in 1912, moving from Burslem to Hanley. This allowed the club to regular host over 10,000 spectators. At the end of the 1913\u201314 season, Vale agreed to stand down for re-election to the Football League, so that their stronger rivals Stoke would have a stronger chance of gaining re-election. It was understood that this favour would one day be repaid. In the meantime, former Stoke veteran and former England international Tom Holford was appointed as player-manager. The club ceased activities in 1914\u201315, in order not to hinder the war effort. During the war Frank Cannon was killed and Alf Smith was seriously wounded. In March 1919 the club failed to win re-election. However they returned to the Football League in October 1919, taking over the fixture list of Leeds City in the Second Division, who were disbanded because of financial irregularities."]}, {"page": "1899\u20131900 Burslem Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Bert Eardley", "|\u2013||FW||||Bert Eardley||1||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "1900\u201301 Burslem Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Bert Eardley", "|2||MF||||Bert Eardley||7||0||0||7"]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 Burslem Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Bert Eardley", "|6||MF||||Bert Eardley||1||1||0||2"]}, {"page": "1902\u201303 Burslem Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Adrian Capes was top scorer with eighteen goals in 37 games, missing just one league game.
