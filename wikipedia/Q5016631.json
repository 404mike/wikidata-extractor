Many commentators believed Henman had a chance to win that year's Wimbledon with several top-seeds being defeated early in the tournament. Henman came through the first three rounds with ease, winning over Artem Derepasko, Martin Lee, and Sjeng Schalken.  However, it took five sets to defeat the 22nd American seed Todd Martin in round four. In the quarter-finals Henman beat a young Roger Federer in four tough sets, the latter having defeated Henman's longtime nemesis Sampras in the fourth round in the only tour match that Sampras and Federer would ever play. In his semi-final Henman met wildcard entrant, Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 where Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 eventually managed to win in five sets in a match that spanned 3 days because of numerous rain delays. Henman had come back from losing the first set and played some stunning tennis \u2013 including crushing Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 in the third set 6\u20130 \u2013 to take the lead by 2 sets to 1 before rain first stopped play. The players returned the following day but Henman couldn't recapture his form from the Friday and lost the fourth set in a tie break. Henman had got as close as 2 points from victory but serve was with his opponent and he was not able to hang on. Only 5 games into the deciding set, rain fell again and the players were forced to wait it out overnight to finish the epic encounter. When the pair finally returned on Sunday, Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 was able to wrap up the final set and dash the English player's dream of reaching a Wimbledon final."]}, {"page": "List of Wimbledon Open Era champions", "response": [" |  Martin Lee  James Trotman"]}, {"page": "Alex Bogdanovic", "response": ["Finished runner-up in the senior national championships that autumn beating top 100 player Martin Lee and British no 4 Arvind Parmar before losing in the final to Lee Childs in straight sets.
