S. Gilbert in 1906, remaining with the D'Oyly Carte company for three years.  After touring in musical theatre for the next five years with other managements, he rejoined D'Oyly Carte from 1915 to 1928 in the principal baritone roles, appearing in London seasons and on tour in Britain and, in one of his last seasons, Canada.  He recorded many of these roles.\nAfter leaving D'Oyly Carte, Sheffield worked in a wide variety of theatre, including musical comedy, straight plays, pantomime, and in radio and films.  He continued to tour during the Second World War while in his seventies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Samuel||Leo Sheffield||Frederick Hobbs||Joseph Griffin||Richard Walker||Hilton Layland", "|Sergeant||Rutland Barrington||Fred Billington||Leo Sheffield||Sydney Granville||Richard Walker"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Pooh-Bah||Fred Billington||Leo Sheffield||Sydney Granville||Richard Walker||Richard Watson", "In 1926, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a brief promotional film of excerpts from The Mikado.
