After spending several years acting in repertory theatre in Farnham and Oxford, Ayrton returned to the Old Vic Theatre in 1951 to teach movement. The following year he opened his own teaching studio in London, though he also taught at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford.In 1954, Ayrton was appointed the Assistant Principal of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, a position he held until 1966, whenceforth he served as the Academy's Principal until 1972.
