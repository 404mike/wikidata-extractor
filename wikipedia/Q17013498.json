His name appears for the first time in the register of vicars-choral at Wells in 1555. Payments received by him around this time suggest that he was also employed as composer and copyist to the Wells Cathedral, most likely before 1550 where he was the Master of Choristers.Only a few of his compositions survive, most incomplete. Among them can be cited an Easter antiphon Christus resurgens in two sections, based on a Sarum Rite plainchant; and a motet Anima Christi for three voices, which was originally just one section of a much longer motet for six voices.\nWilliam Parsons is believed to be the same \"W. Parsons\" who composed 81 out of the 141 settings in John Day's The Whole Psalmes in Foure Parts (circa 1561 - 63). The Flatt Service by \"Mr. Parsons of Wells\" was also probably written by him; the location was added to distinguish him from \"Mr. Parsons of Exeter\", whose music features in the same source.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Parsons", "response": ["William Parsons may refer to:", "*William Parsons (composer and copyist) (fl.1545\u20131563), English Renaissance composer and copyist from Wells", "*William Parsons (composer and musician) (1745/6\u20131817), Master of the King's Music", "*William Parsons (poet) (1764 ca.\u20131828), English writer associated with the Della Cruscan movement", "*William Parsons (actor) in Trudeau (film)", "*William Parsons (silent film actor) (1878\u20131919), American silent comedy film actor often credited as \"Smiling Bill Parsons\"", "**Sir William Parsons, 1st Baronet of Langley (c.1636\u2013c.1662)", "**Sir William Parsons, 1st Baronet of Bellamont (died 1650), Surveyor General of Ireland and Member of Parliament ", "**Sir William Parsons, 2nd Baronet of Bellamont (died 1658)", "**Sir William Parsons, 2nd Baronet of Birr Castle (died 1741)", "**Sir William Parsons, 4th Baronet of Birr Castle (1731\u20131791), Irish politician", "**William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse (1800\u20131867), Lord Rosse, Irish astronomer", "**William Parsons, 5th Earl of Rosse (1873\u20131918), elected a Representative Peer in 1911", "**William Parsons, 7th Earl of Rosse (born 1936), worked for the United Nations "]}, {"page": "Robert Parsons (composer)", "response": ["Parsons was born around 1530\u201335, but no details of his birth survive and there is no evidence connecting him with either Robert Parsons (1596-1676), a vicar choral at Exeter Cathedral, or his contemporary, the composer William Parsons of Wells.
