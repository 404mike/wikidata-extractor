The Australian Coronation Contingent (ACC) comprised 100 soldiers, 25 sailors and 25 airmen. Half the soldiers were serving troops and half were returned members of the AIF. Sullivan was the only VC recipient in the group. As a condition of joining the ACC, Sullivan was re-enlisted as a gunner in the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery on 31 January. The ACC went into camp in Melbourne on 1 February, where they were subjected to drill, physical exercise, route marches and picquet duty for two weeks. On 16 February, the ACC embarked at Melbourne on the ocean liner , and Sullivan was upgraded to a first-class berth. Sullivan did not take to being under military discipline again, and he was charged with two disciplinary offences whilst aboard.
