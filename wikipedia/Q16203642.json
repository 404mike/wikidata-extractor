Substitute Chris Burke, a half-time replacement for loan striker Aaron Mclean, played a major role in earning Birmingham a draw at home to Middlesbrough. After Jonathan Woodgate narrowly failed to head past his own goalkeeper, Burke was fouled for a penalty, converted by Caddis to tie the scores. Middlesbrough regained the lead when Birmingham failed to clear a corner, then in the 94th minute Kyle Bartley met Burke's corner with a powerful header to equalise. With Mitch Hancox injured against Middlesbrough and Robinson and Burn nearing suspensions, young defenders Will Packwood and Amari'i Bell were recalled from loan, and Bell was included on the bench, for the visit to AFC Bournemouth. Andy Shinnie's first league goal, from Lee's precise cross, and \u017digi\u0107's neat finish from Lingard's through ball gave Birmingham a 2\u20130 win, despite the home side's massive superiority of possession and shots.", "Without Robinson, suspended for two matches after receiving his tenth yellow card, Hancox, who injured an ankle shortly before the game, and \u017digi\u0107, dropped, Bartley returned from injury and Birmingham gave a debut to 19-year-old left back Amari'i Bell and first league starts of the season to Will Packwood and loanee Albert Rusn\u00e1k for the visit of Leicester City. Paul Caddis took over the captaincy. In the first half, Birmingham were \"relentlessly battered\" by the league leaders, though conceded only once, and after L\u00f8venkrands replaced Lee at half time, they \"played with more verve and imagination\". After they failed to force the ball home in a goalmouth scramble, Leicester broke at pace and Jamie Vardy increased the lead. L\u00f8venkrands scored late on with a header from Burke's cross and Rusn\u00e1k had a chance for an unlikely draw, but Leicester won their eighth successive game and Birmingham extended their winless run at home in the league to four months.Tattum, Colin (28 January 2014). \"Birmingham City 1 Leicester City 2\".
