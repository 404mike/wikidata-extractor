He was criticized for his subsequent denial of, and thereby exacerbation of, widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR, most particularly the famine in Ukraine. Years later, there continue to be calls to revoke his Pulitzer, which to this day still has not occurred. In 1990, The New York Times, which had submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleister Crowley", "response": ["In March 1913, Crowley acted as producer for The Ragged Ragtime Girls, a group of female violinists led by Waddell, as they performed at London's Old Tivoli theatre.

In Moscow, Crowley continued to write plays and poetry, including \"Hymn to Pan\", and the Gnostic Mass, a Thelemic ritual that became a key part of O.T.O. liturgy. Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city. In January 1914, Crowley and Neuburg settled into an apartment in Paris, where the former was involved in the controversy surrounding Jacob Epstein's new monument to Oscar Wilde. Together Crowley and Neuburg performed the six-week \"Paris Working\", a period of intense ritual involving strong drug use in which they invoked the gods Mercury and Jupiter. As part of the ritual, the couple performed acts of sex magic together, at times being joined by journalist Walter Duranty. Inspired by the results of the Working, Crowley wrote Liber Agap\u00e9, a treatise on sex magic. Following the Paris Working, Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley, resulting in an argument in which Crowley cursed him."]}, {"page": "Pulitzer Prize", "response": ["* Call for revocation of journalist Walter Duranty's 1932 Pulitzer Prize."]}, {"page": "The New York Times", "response": ["=== Walter Duranty's Holodomor coverage and Pulitzer ===", "Walter Duranty, who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936, has been criticized for a series of stories in 1931 on the Soviet Union and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time; however, he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly Holodomor, a famine in Soviet Ukraine in the 1930s in which he summarized Russian propaganda, and the Times published, as fact: \"Conditions are bad, but there is no famine\".Conquest, R.
