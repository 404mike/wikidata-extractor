He was criticized for his subsequent denial of, and thereby exacerbation of, widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR, most particularly the famine in Ukraine. Years later, there continue to be calls to revoke his Pulitzer, which to this day still has not occurred. In 1990, The New York Times, which had submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
