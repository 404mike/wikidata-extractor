The most famous British phrenologist of the 20th century was the London psychiatrist Bernard Hollander (1864\u20131934). His main works, The Mental Function of the Brain (1901) and Scientific Phrenology (1902), are an appraisal of Gall's teachings. Hollander introduced a quantitative approach to the phrenological diagnosis, defining a method for measuring the skull, and comparing the measurements with statistical averages."]}, {"page": "Jerry Fodor", "response": ["Fodor revived the idea of modularity, without the notion of precise physical localizability, in the 1980s, and became one of the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph The Modularity of Mind, where he points to Gall through Bernard Hollander, which is the author cited in the references instead, more specifically Hollander's In search of the soul.Hollander, Bernard (1920). In search of the soul: and the mechanism of thought, emotion, and conduct. Volume 1, Volume 2 (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner). Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world."]}, {"page": "Hollander", "response": ["* Bernard Hollander (1864\u20131934), London psychiatrist "]}]}}
