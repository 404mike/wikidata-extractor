Knowles had been a pupil at Richmond School, but died not long after his poetry was published. In 1861, the Bishop of Ripon ordered that a tombstone be removed from the grave of a recent burial as it contained the Latin phrase Miserere mei deus, which, at the time, was contrary to what was allowed as it was viewed as a \"Purgatorial text\". The family were consulted and they refused to remove the stone, so the church authorities did it instead."]}]}}
