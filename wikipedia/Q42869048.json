The game was selected as the televised match of the round and broadcast live on the BBC Red Button. City won a five-goal thriller 3\u20132 with a brace from England international Ellen White putting the away side ahead. Substitute Lauren James pulled one back for United in the 69th-minute and the Red Devils thought they had drawn level when former City player Abbie McManus saw her shot trickle over the line but the officials disagreed, putting the lack of goal-line technology in women's football under scrutiny. Jill Scott restored City's two-goal cushion shortly after while a Lauren Hemp own goal two minutes from time set up a nervy finish. The fifth round paired the defending FA Cup champions in a favourable matchup against Ipswich Town of the FA Women's National League Division One South East (tier 4), the lowest ranked team left in the competition who had entered during second round qualifying and won six games to reach this stage. Pauline Bremer, Jess Park and Georgia Stanway all scored hat-tricks as City ran out resounding 10\u20130 winners. Reaching the quarter-final stage for the seventh consecutive season, City were drawn against Championship side Leicester City. With the season postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic the 2019\u201320 FA WSL season was eventually curtailed and decided on a points-per-game basis, moving City down from 1st to 2nd in the process as Chelsea were declared WSL champions. Despite this, the FA Cup was permitted to resume at the quarter-final stage six months later than planned with opponents Leicester City having transitioned from semi-professional to full-time during the offseason layoff. Manchester City, meanwhile, had appointed Gareth Taylor as manager ahead of the new season on 28 May following the departure of Nick Cushing during the previous campaign. Despite the increased investment and influx of WSL talent to the new-look Leicester team, the Cityzens were able to see off the Foxes 2\u20131. Chloe Kelly, who had joined the Manchester club from Everton over summer, scored her first goal as a City player from the penalty spot to open scoring with Georgia Stanway doubling the lead before half-time. Leicester earned a penalty of their own in the 78th-minute, converted by Charlie Devlin, but City were again able to see out the win to set up a semi-final meeting with Arsenal. The teams had already met at the semi-final stage of the 2019\u201320 FA Women's League Cup earlier in the year with the Gunners emerging 2\u20131 winners. City were able to reverse the scoreline in this rematch: England international teammates Steph Houghton and Jordan Nobbs traded first-half goals before Sam Mewis, City's reigning World Cup champion midfielder acquired from North Carolina Courage in August, scored her first goal in English football to clinch the defending champions' place in the final."]}, {"page": "List of FA Women's Super League managers", "response": ["| Nick Cushing || align=center | 104 || Manchester City (104)", "| Nick Cushing || align=center | 72 || Manchester City (72)", "| Nick Cushing || align=center | 72 (104) || Manchester City (2013\u201320) || align=center | ", "| Nick Cushing", "| Nick Cushing", "| Nick Cushing"]}]}}
