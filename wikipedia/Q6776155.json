He made 412 appearances in the Football League, playing for Southport, Birmingham City, Coventry City, Derby County and Crewe Alexandra.McDonnell was born in Newton-le-Willows, which was then in Lancashire, in 1924. He played local football for Haydock C&B before joining Everton in 1942. After seven appearances in the wartime leagues spread over the next three seasons, he returned to local football with Earlestown, from where he joined Southport in August 1946, before the Football League resumed after the war. After one season Harry Storer signed him for Birmingham City as deputy for Ted Duckhouse. Two years later, Storer, now managing Coventry City, signed him again, and McDonnell remained at the club for six seasons and played 250 games in all competitions. When Storer took over as manager of Derby County, he promptly signed McDonnell for the third time. After three seasons with Derby, where he played more than 100 games in all competitions and helped the club win the Third Division North title in 1956\u201357, McDonnell finished off his professional career at Crewe Alexandra. He died in Bedford in 1988.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sligo Rovers F.C.", "response": ["|8||align=left|||Martin McDonnell||1979\u20131984, 1990\u20131997||284 (214)"]}, {"page": "Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)", "response": ["Taylor was sold to Middlesbrough in the summer of 1955 for \u00a33,500 by new Coventry manager Jesse Carver, following an assessment of the playing staff by Carver and new coach George Raynor. It was at Middlesbrough that Taylor first met his future managerial partner Brian Clough, who was then fourth-choice striker at Ayresome Park. Taylor spotted Clough's potential and helped him to achieve a place in the first team. Taylor initially contacted Storer, now manager of Derby County, to try and get him to sign Clough, but Storer had told him he had spent the club's budget on signing Martin McDonnell and Paddy Ryan. Manager Bob Dennison led \"Boro\" to 14th in the Second Division in 1955\u201356, seeing both Clough and Taylor only as \"useful reserves\". The pair spent their spare time coaching schoolboys to boost their wages and to gain experience. Clough went on to become the club's star striker with 197 goals in 213 league games, and though Taylor would also break into the first team after replacing Rolando Ugolini, he later said he was only ever an \"average goalkeeper\"."]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 in English football", "response": ["* 13 April 1988: Martin McDonnell, 63, played 412 league games between 1946 and 1960 for Everton, Southport, Birmingham City, Coventry City, Derby County and Crewe Alexandra."]}, {"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["The 1949\u201350 season started very badly for Coventry, with just one win in the first twelve games and conceding large numbers of goals. The signing of defender Martin McDonnell led to a temporary improvement, but another poor run in the new year left the club facing relegation. Once again, the club had to spend their way out of danger; the signing of Bryn Allen and Ken Chisholm inspired a successful last eight games and a mid-table finish. By contrast, the following season started very well and the club were top of Division Two table at Christmas. They made several expensive signings, including full-back Terry Springthorpe and striker Tommy Briggs, but these players had no impact at the club and a run of poor performance in the new year ended their promotion hopes. Despite a reasonable start to the 1951\u201352 season, this poor form resumed from September as an ageing City team \u2013 the average was 31 years \u2013 faced almost certain relegation by February. Despite several signings, the club were relegated back to Division Three South with a final-day defeat at Leeds United."]}]}}
