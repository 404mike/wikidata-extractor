Sharp's pseudonym came about during the recording of Blue Lines, where he was the only person working on the album being regularly paid. Amongst other works he produced are Neneh Cherry's albums Raw Like Sushi, Homebrew and Man, Gabrielle's third album Rise, and early remixes for Portishead; he also co-wrote the anti-racism song \"7 Seconds\" featuring Youssou N'dour and Kylie Minogue's \"Confide in Me\".Later works include Natty's \"Man Like I\" and Eliza Doolittle's debut album of the same name. His father was the Australian film director, Don Sharp.

The Wild Bunch and its associates included at various times in its existence the MC Adrian \"Tricky Kid\" Thaws, the graffiti artist and lyricist Robert \"3D\" Del Naja, producer Jonny Dollar and the DJs Nellee Hooper, Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles and Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall. As the hip hop scene matured in Bristol and musical trends evolved further toward acid jazz and house in the late 1980s, the golden era of the soundsystem began to end. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal and evolved into Massive Attack, a core collective of 3D, Mushroom and Daddy G, with significant contributions from Tricky Kid (soon shortened to Tricky), Dollar, and Hooper on production duties, along with a rotating cast of other vocalists."]}, {"page": "Massive Attack", "response": ["Massive Attack started as a spin-off production group in 1988, with the independently released song, \"Any Love\", sung by falsetto-voiced singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy, and then, with considerable backing from Neneh Cherry, they signed to Circa Records in 1990\u2014committing to deliver six studio albums and a \"best of\" compilation.

McVey (credited at the time as 'Booga Bear') and his wife, Neneh Cherry, provided crucial financial support and in-kind assistance to the early careers of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky during this period, even paying regular wages to them through their Cherry Bear organisation.
