After a period as a junior schoolmaster in Wrexham, he spent one term at Jesus College, Oxford, before going to teach at Oswestry grammar school.  He then taught at the grammar school in Carmarthen before being appointed head of a free school in his native area.  From 1800 to 1807, he taught in Dolgellau, where he remained until his death.", "link_mentions": {}}}
