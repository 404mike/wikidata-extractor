The first of these goals, scored against Blackburn Rovers on 3 September 1892, was also the club's first ever league goal.

Born in Derby, he began his career at Ashford United. In January 1900, he became Newton Heath's first signing for which they paid a fee, joining the club for \u00a340 on the recommendation of forward Bob Donaldson. Half of the fee was paid on signing, with the remainder due if Godsmark were kept on after an initial trial period. He made his debut on 3 February 1900, playing at inside right in a 1\u20130 home win over Sheffield Wednesday; his performance was well received, with the Athletic News reporting that \"Godsmark proved a great success, he has any amount of dash and ability\".Dykes (1994), pp. 151\u20132. However, his stay at Newton Heath was curtailed three months later by a call-up to be a reservist with the British Army in the Second Boer War, after just nine league appearances and four goals. After just nine months in South Africa, Godsmark died from an unknown disease. Because his death meant he was unable to return to Newton Heath after the war, despite them retaining his registration after he was enlisted, they withheld the remaining \u00a320 of his fee, for which Ashford served them with a writ."]}, {"page": "1897\u201398 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Despite still being unable to field a full-strength team, and with players in unaccustomed positions, Small Heath's winning ways continued at home to Newton Heath.
