During his time in Birmingham, Prior's work was often concerned with integrating acoustic space as a compositional parameter in his work. This theme stimulated interests which still define the work he is involved in today, whether that be through his installations, sound-walks, acousmatic compositions or the sound designs he has made for museums and galleries. Another feature of the work Prior was producing during this period but less evident in more recent projects, was the attempt to assimilate free improvisation into the devising of his ultimately 'fixed' compositions, for example Somewhere Submarine (1996), for piano and tape (joint winner of the 1997 Cornelius Cardew Composition Competition) and Another Poisonous Sunset (1998)."]}, {"page": "Andrew Lewis (composer)", "response": ["He studied music at the University of Birmingham in England, first as an undergraduate (1981\u201384), then as a postgraduate studying composition with Jonty Harrison.

Jonty Harrison, David Prior, Iain Armstrong and Robert Penman have left a telling influence on his sonic production. One characteristic feature of Dr Saarios work is his willingness to counterbalance within his work a wide range of aesthetic and academic approaches. The literary output of William S. Burroughs has been evident since his earliest compositions.  The philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari and the filmwork of David Lynch and the Dogma 95 collaboration in particular underpin his composition as well as his academic approach.  Since 2001 majority of his output has been collaborative, and in many instances interdisciplinary (e.g. 'The Hollywoods' and 'Aboriginal Terraformations' with visual artist Amanda Newall, and the [zygote] concept with composer and musicologist Martin Iddon).
