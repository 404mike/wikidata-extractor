He played first-class cricket for Oxford until 1908, making a further sixteen appearances. He scored 772 runs in his seventeen first-class appearances, averaging 24.06. He had one innings of note, when he scored 228 against the Gentlemen of England in 1907, which included thirty fours and a single six and contributed toward an opening stand of 338 with Hugh Teesdale. With his slow bowling, Bowring took 20 wickets at a bowling average of 26.75 and best figures of 3 for 10.

His cousin was the cricketer Wilfred Stoddart."]}]}}
