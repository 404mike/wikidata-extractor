Bute's desires and money allied with Burges' fantastical imagination and skill led to the creation of two of the finest examples of the late Victorian era Gothic Revival, Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch. The two buildings represent both the potential of colossal industrial wealth and the desire to escape the scene of that wealth's creation. The theme recurs again and again in the huge outpouring of Bute's patronage, in chapels, castle, abbeys, universities and palaces. Bute's later buildings are hardly less remarkable than his collaborations with Burges. Robert Rowand Anderson rebuilt the Georgian Mount Stuart House for him, and Bute worked in collaboration with many of Burges's colleagues, including William Frame and Horatio Walter Lonsdale, on the interiors. John Kinross was Bute's architect for the sympathetic and creative reworking of the partially ruined Falkland Palace. Kinross also restored Greyfriars in Elgin for Bute."]}, {"page": "William Burges", "response": ["Burges inspired considerable loyalty within his team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff."]}, {"page": "The Tower House", "response": ["At the Tower House Burges drew on his own \"experience of twenty years learning, travelling and building\", and used many of the artists and craftsmen who had worked with him on earlier buildings. An estimate book compiled by him, and now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, contains the names of the individuals and companies that worked at the house. Thomas Nicholls was responsible for the stone carving, including the capitals, corbels and the chimneypieces. The mosaic and marble work was contracted to Burke and Company of Regent Street, while the decorative tiles were supplied by W. B. Simpson and Sons Ltd of the Strand. John Ayres Hatfield crafted the bronze decorations on the doors, while the woodwork was the responsibility of John Walden of Covent Garden. Henry Stacy Marks and Frederick Weekes were employed to decorate the walls with murals, and Campbell and Smith of Southampton Row had responsibility for most of the painted decoration. Marks painted birds above the frieze in the library, and the illustrations of famous lovers in the drawing-room were by Weekes. They also painted the figures on the bookcases in the library. The stained glass was by Saunders and Company of Long Acre, with initial designs by Horatio Walter Lonsdale."]}, {"page": "St Luke's Church, Holmes Chapel", "response": ["The timber roof was revealed when a later plaster ceiling was removed.  This dates from the 15th\u00a0century and is a combination of arch braced trusses with cambered tie beams.  Oak panelled galleries dating from around 1705 are over the west end and the south aisle, the former containing the organ, and the latter box pews.  A carved oak crest dated 1622 is near the communion rail.  The stone font is dated 1890 and the oak pulpit is also from the 19th\u00a0century.  On the walls are wall memorials.  The brass candelabrum, dated 1708, is the oldest in any church in Cheshire.   The stained glass in the east window dates from 1921, and was designed by Horatio Walter Lonsdale.  There are monuments in the church dated 1715, 1801, and 1836.  The organ was built in 1851 by Richard Jackson and was rebuilt around 1900 by A.\u00a0Young, and again in 1972 by L.\u00a0Reeves.  There is a ring of six bells, four of which by are Richard Sanders and date from 1709.  The other two bells are dated 1858 and were cast by G.\u00a0Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.  The parish registers begin in 1613 and the churchwardens' accounts from 1812."]}, {"page": "Lonsdale (surname)", "response": ["*Horatio Walter Lonsdale (1844\u20131919), English painter and designer"]}, {"page": "St Mark's Church, Salisbury", "response": ["St Mark's exterior is faced with stone from the Hurdcott quarries, with dressings and window tracery in Doulting stone. The interior uses stone sourced from Corsham Down. The initial phase of work carried out in 1892\u201394 provided accommodation for 500 persons. The church has a Cruciform plan and is made up of a five-bay nave (with aisles, narthex and flanking spaces), transepts, crossing tower, two-bay chancel with south chapel, south porch, annexe and organ gallery. The chancel retains its original fittings of oak and includes a window designed in 1960 by M. Maybee. The Lady chapel contains stained glass windows designed by Horatio Walter Lonsdale in 1898."]}]}}
