Inspired by artists such as Max Ernst, \u00d3scar Dom\u00ednguez and Salvador Dal\u00ed, he rejected academic painting in favour of techniques that expressed the surrealistic spirit of rebellion. Maddox officially joined the British Surrealist Group in 1938.\nHis creations soon began not only to challenge the conventional view of reality, but also to push pictorial expression to the limits of consciousness. He was even implicated in both scandal and controversy when, during World War II, Scotland Yard suspected him of fifth columnist sabotage and mounted a surprise raid to seize works thought to contain coded messages to the enemy.\nFollowing the war he moved to Balsall Heath and began his most active period.\nIn 1948, he married Nan Burton. They had a daughter and a son together, but had the marriage dissolved in 1955. He died in London, aged 92.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
