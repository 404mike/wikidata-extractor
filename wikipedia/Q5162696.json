Inspired by artists such as Max Ernst, \u00d3scar Dom\u00ednguez and Salvador Dal\u00ed, he rejected academic painting in favour of techniques that expressed the surrealistic spirit of rebellion. Maddox officially joined the British Surrealist Group in 1938.\nHis creations soon began not only to challenge the conventional view of reality, but also to push pictorial expression to the limits of consciousness. He was even implicated in both scandal and controversy when, during World War II, Scotland Yard suspected him of fifth columnist sabotage and mounted a surprise raid to seize works thought to contain coded messages to the enemy.\nFollowing the war he moved to Balsall Heath and began his most active period.\nIn 1948, he married Nan Burton. They had a daughter and a son together, but had the marriage dissolved in 1955. He died in London, aged 92.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Balsall Heath", "response": ["*Conroy Maddox, surrealist artist"]}, {"page": "January 14", "response": ["*  2005   \u2013 Conroy Maddox, English painter and educator (b. 1912)"]}, {"page": "Surrealism", "response": ["During the 1940s Surrealism's influence was also felt in England, America and the Netherlands where Gertrude Pape and her husband Theo van Baaren helped to popularize it in their publication The Clean Handkerchief. Mark Rothko took an interest in biomorphic figures, and in England Henry Moore, Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon and Paul Nash used or experimented with Surrealist techniques. However, Conroy Maddox, one of the first British Surrealists whose work in this genre dated from 1935, remained within the movement, and organized an exhibition of current Surrealist work in 1978 in response to an earlier show which infuriated him because it did not properly represent Surrealism. Maddox's exhibition, titled Surrealism Unlimited, was held in Paris and attracted international attention. He held his last one-man show in 2002, and died three years later."]}, {"page": "1912", "response": ["* December 27 \u2013 Conroy Maddox, British painter (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "1912 in art", "response": ["* December 27 \u2013 Conroy Maddox, English surrealist painter, collagist, writer and lecturer (d.2005)"]}, {"page": "1940 in art", "response": ["* Conroy Maddox \u2013 The Strange Country"]}, {"page": "Ledbury", "response": ["* Conroy Maddox, artist."]}, {"page": "Herefordshire", "response": ["* Conroy Maddox, artist"]}, {"page": "British Surrealist Group", "response": ["* Conroy Maddox (1912\u20132005)"]}, {"page": "Chipping Norton", "response": ["*Conroy Maddox (1912\u20132005), surrealist painter resident here in 1929\u20131933"]}]}}
