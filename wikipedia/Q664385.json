He studied the instrument under Aubrey Brain, father of Dennis Brain.\nCivil was engaged by Thomas Beecham to play second horn to Dennis Brain in the  Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and when Brain left for the Philharmonia, Civil took over leadership of the section. In 1955, Civil joined the Philharmonia himself, becoming principal horn player when Brain died in a car crash in 1957.\nIn the 1960s, Civil became the first non-German to be approached by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra to become a member. Civil stuck with the Philharmonia however, who were reshaping themselves into the New Philharmonia. In 1966 he became principal hornist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, remaining there until his retirement in 1988.\nAs a soloist, Civil recorded the horn concertos of Mozart (with the Philharmonia, under Otto Klemperer, 1960), and his recording of Benjamin Britten's Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings with Robert Tear is also quite well known. He also played chamber music in the Alan Civil Horn Trio.\nAs well as his work in classical music, Civil played the horn solo on The Beatles' song \"For No One\" from the album Revolver and was one of only five session musicians to get a named credit on a Beatles recording.\nCivil was also part of the orchestra crescendo in the song \"A Day in the Life\" from the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\nCivil taught at the Royal College of Music. Among his pupils is Timothy Brown. He was appointed an OBE in 1985.\nCivil died of liver and kidney failure on 19 March 1989 at King's College Hospital in London. He was 59 years old.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "French horn", "response": ["*Alan Civil \u2013 former principal horn of the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and the BBC Symphony Orchestra"]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["\"For No One\" was inspired by McCartney's relationship with English actress Jane Asher. Along with \"Good Day Sunshine\", which similarly dispensed with guitar parts for Harrison and Lennon, Rodriguez cites the track as an example of McCartney eschewing the group dynamic when recording his songs, a trend that would prove unpopular with his bandmates in later years. The recording features McCartney playing piano, bass and clavichord, accompanied by Starr on drums and percussion. The French horn solo was added by Alan Civil, the principal horn player for the Philharmonia Orchestra, who recalled having to \"busk\" his part, with little guidance from McCartney or Martin at the overdubbing session. While recognising McCartney's \"customary logic\" in the song's musical structure, MacDonald comments on the sense of detachment conveyed in the lyrics to this \"curiously phlegmatic account of the end of an affair\".
