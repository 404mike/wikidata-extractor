The category I maintain should be kept in mind, repetition, by which eternity is entered forwards.\"  Kierkegaard wrote Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits in 1847. He said, \"A Providence watches over each man\u2019s wandering through life. It provides him with two guides. The one calls him forward. The other calls him back. They are, however, not in opposition to each other, these two guides, nor do they leave the wanderer standing there in doubt, confused by the double call. Rather the two are in eternal understanding with each other. For the one beckons forward to the Good, the other calls man back from evil. These guides are called repentance and remorse. The eager traveler hurries forward to the new, to the novel, and, indeed, away from experience. But the remorseful one, who comes behind, laboriously gathers up experience.Read it here: Purity of Heart Kierkegaard also mentions this idea in his Journals. He wrote: \"It is quite true what philosophy says; that life must be understood backwards. But then one forgets the other principle: that it must be lived forwards. Which principle, the more one thinks it through, ends exactly with the thought that temporal life can never properly be understood precisely because I can at no instant find complete rest in which to adopt a position: backwards.Journals IV A 164 (1843) See Kierkegaard: Papers and Journals, Translated by Alastair Hannay, 1996 P. 63 and 161", "* S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard \"The Concept of Anxiety\" 1844, translation by Alastair Hannay, March 2014 Kirkus Review"]}, {"page": "Theology of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard", "response": ["*Alastair Hannay.
