Sidlow with Charlie Ashcroft and Ray Minshull were the goalkeepers vying for the number one jersey at Anfield for the 1946/47 season; the first competitive  season following the war. Even with the competition, Sidlow was given the position, which he held for 34 of the 42 games in a season that saw Liverpool win their first championship for 24 years. Much of which is owed to Sidlow as the final game of the season was a must win for the Reds. Sidlow's former employers Wolves needed just a point to win the title and Liverpool had to face them at Molineux. the Reds were a point back on their hosts and, needed a victory to win the league title. After a comprehensive 5\u20130 win at Anfield, Wolves were favourites to win the game and take the title, but goals from Jack Balmer and Albert Stubbins, plus Sidlow and the backline keeping Wolves down to one meant the Championship trophy would be heading to Merseyside."]}, {"page": "Ashcroft", "response": ["* Charlie Ashcroft, English footballer"]}, {"page": "2010 in association football", "response": ["* 13 March - Charlie Ashcroft, English footballer (83)"]}, {"page": "George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)", "response": ["In one game against Brighton in October 1957, when he was playing for the injured Roy Kirk, Henderson wrote that Curtis \"did his best\", but was \"too often beaten in the air\". Towards the end of the 1957\u201358 season, Curtis began playing regularly in the Coventry first team, having switched position to centre-half. In their game away against Aldershot, Henderson described it as the day \"that George Curtis, Coventry City's boy footballer, became George Curtis the man\". With Coventry in the lower half of the Third Division South, and heading towards a place in the new Fourth Division, Aldershot's forwards had numerous attacks on the Coventry goal, but they scored only once, which Henderson attributed to Curtis's defending alongside saves from goalkeeper Charlie Ashcroft.
