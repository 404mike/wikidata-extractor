One was that of splitting Suffolk into two unitary authorities \u2013 Ipswich and Felixstowe and Rural Suffolk; and the other, that of creating a single county-wide controlling authority \u2013 the \"One Suffolk\" option. In February 2010, the then-Minister Rosie Winterton announced that no changes would be imposed on the structure of local government in the county as a result of the review, but that the government would be: \"asking Suffolk councils and MPs to reach a consensus on what unitary solution they want through a countywide constitutional convention\". Following the May 2010 general election, all further moves towards any of the suggested unitary solutions ceased on the instructions of the incoming Coalition government. In 2018 it was determined that Forest Heath and St Edmundsbury would be merged to form a new West Suffolk district, while Waveney and Suffolk Coastal would similarly form a new East Suffolk district. These changes took effect on 1 April 2019."]}, {"page": "1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["Although the Conservatives lost many ministers such as Michael Portillo, Tony Newton, Malcolm Rifkind, Ian Lang and William Waldegrave and controversial MPs such as Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken, some of the Conservative newcomers in this election were future Prime Minister Theresa May, future Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond as well as future Speaker John Bercow.
