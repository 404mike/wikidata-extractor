He served as an MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as well as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He was one of the few people to have served in both the House of Commons and in the Oireachtas.\nDuring World War I, he served in the British Army as an officer with an Irish regiment on the Western Front. He was the son of John Redmond, the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party from 1900 to 1918, and was one of a dynasty of Liberal and Irish Nationalist politicians who are commemorated in Redmond Square in Wexford town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1918 Irish general election", "response": ["The IPP suffered a catastrophic defeat and even its leader, John Dillon, was not re-elected. It won only six seats in Ireland, its losses exaggerated by the \"first-past-the-post\" system which gave it a share of seats far short of its much larger share of the vote (21.7%) and the number of seats it would have won under a \"proportional representation\" ballot system. All but one of its seats were in Ulster. The exception was Waterford City, the seat previously held by John Redmond, who had died earlier in the year, and retained by his son Captain William Redmond. Four of their Ulster seats were part of the deal to avoid unionist victories which saved some for the party but may have cost it the support of Protestant voters elsewhere. The IPP came close to winning other seats in Louth and Wexford South, and in general their support held up better in the north and east of the island. The party was represented in Westminster by seven MPs because T. P. O'Connor won the Liverpool Scotland seat due to Irish emigrant votes. The remnants of the IPP in time became the Nationalist Party under the leadership of Joseph Devlin. In the 26 counties that became the Irish Free State, the Irish Parliamentary Party won 181,320 votes out of 606,117 total votes cast in the contested seats which amounts to a 26.0% vote share. If the Independent Home Rule Nationalists are included there were 11,162 votes which comes to 1.8% and a vote share of 27.8% for the Nationalists.
