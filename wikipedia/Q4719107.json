He was re-elected at the next election in 1922. In the following year the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, called an election on the issue of tariff reform. Astbury was regarded as having a very safe seat. However, the election saw a large electoral advance by the Labour Party, who gained all three Salford constituencies. Astbury was unseated by Labour's Alexander Haycock. Following the election, a minority Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald was formed. The administration collapsed in the following year, necessitating a further general election. Astbury regained the seat, benefitting from a large nationwide swing to the Conservatives. At the next election in 1929 the situation was reversed, there was a swing to Labour, which became the largest party in the Commons for the first time and Astbury was unseated by Haycock for a second time. By the time of the next general election in 1931 a National Government had been formed. Haycock and the majority of the Labour Party MPs refused to support the government. Astbury, running as a National Conservative highlighting a new, strengthened alliance struck with MacDonald and the National Labour Organisation in the throes of the Great Depression regained the seat."]}, {"page": "Haycock (surname)", "response": ["* Alexander Haycock (1882\u20131970), British politician"]}, {"page": "Haycock, Alexander", "response": ["#redirectAlexander Haycock"]}]}}
