According to Maimonides in Mishnah Pe'ah 8:5, it is possible to test the trigonometric calculations for the volume of one log (= the volume of 6 eggs), by filling up a space 4 fingerbreadths x 4 fingerbreadths in breadth (the finger's breadth being appx. 2.5 cm), with a depth of 2 fingerbreadths and  of another fingerbreadth.

The lethek is mentioned only once in the Masoretic Text, and the Septuagint translates it by the Greek term nebeloinou, meaning wine-skin. These measurements were related as follows:", "The omer, which the Torah mentions as being equal to one-tenth of an ephah, is equivalent to the capacity of 43.2 eggs, or what is also known as one-tenth of three seahs.Based on the Aramaic Targum of pseudo-Jonathan ben Uzziel on Exodus 16:36 who says: \"an omer is one-tenth of three seahs.\" In Hebrew measures, 1 seah is equal to the capacity of 144 eggs. Three seahs are the equivalent of 432 eggs; one-tenth of this is 43.2 eggs (The Mishnah, ed. Herbert Danby, Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix II, p. 798) In dry weight, the omer weighed between 1.560\u00a0kg to 1.770\u00a0kg, being the quantity of flour required to separate therefrom the dough offering.Maimonides brings down its approximate weight in Egyptian dirhams, writing in Mishnah Eduyot 1:2: \"...And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty dirhams of wheat flour, while all these dirhams are the Egyptian [dirham].\" This view is repeated by Maran's Shulhan Arukh (Hil. Hallah, Yoreh Deah \u00a7324:3) in the name of the Tur. In Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah (Eduyot 1:2, note 18), Rabbi Yosef Qafih explains that the weight of each Egyptian dirham was approximately 3.333 grams, which total weight of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion comes to approximately 1 kilo and 733 grams. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, in his Sefer Halikhot \u02bfOlam (vol. 1, pp. 288-291), makes use of a different standard for the Egyptian dirham, saying that it weighed approximately 3 grams, meaning the minimum requirement for separating the priest's portion is 1 kilo and 560 grams. Others (e.g. Rabbi Avraham Chaim Naeh) say the Egyptian dirham weighed approximately 3.205 grams, which total weight for the requirement of separating the dough-portion comes to 1 kilo and 666 grams. Rabbi Shelomo Qorah (Chief Rabbi of Bnei Barak) brings down the traditional weight used in Yemen for each dirham, saying that it weighed 3.36 grams, making the total weight for the required separation of the dough-portion to be 1 kilo and 770.72 grams. In the Torah, it is the Priestly Code which refers to the omer, rather than to the se'ah or kab; textual scholars view the Priestly Code as one of the later sources of the Torah, dating from a period when Egypt and Assyria had much more direct influence over Israel.Richard Elliott Friedman, Who wrote the Bible?"]}, {"page": "Phoenician alphabet", "response": ["The Phoenician alphabet was known to the Jewish sages of the Second Temple era, who called it the \"Old Hebrew\" (Paleo-Hebrew) script.The Mishnah, ed.

Julias lay in an administrative district known as Gaulonitis. Historians have suggested that the name is also referenced in rabbinic literature under the epithet \u1e62aidan ().Historical geographer Samuel Klein opines that this place is to be recognised in the name  (\u1e62aidan) of Mishnah Gittin 7:5, Mishnah Avodah Zarah 3:7, Mishnah Gittin 4:7 (BT Gittin 46a), and Jerusalem Talmud (She\u1e33alim 6:2). Klein wrote: \"`Bethsaida = Julias at the confluence of the Jordan in the lake, [a place] not proven in Jewish tradition.` (Sch.) \u2013 However, I suspect that Bethsaida occurs in the Talmudic literature called \u1e62aidan. ...The fact that the name \u1e62aidan () is not preceded by the word 'Beth' () presents no difficulty in explaining the two names as being identical, since similar things are more common among Galilean names (e.g. Maon and Meron; Beth-Maon and Beth-Meron)\" (Klein 1915:167\u2013168). Herbert Danby, in his English translation of the Mishnah, erroneously transliterated the proper name  in all places as \"Sidon\" in Phoenicia, even though Sidon is almost always spelt in Hebrew as , with a waw (). Marcus Jastrow also follows the general view that  is none other than Sidon of Phoenicia. Conversely, the Yemenite Babylonian Talmud, punctuated by Yosef Amir, has distinguished between the two sites, assigning the vowels pata\u1e25 and qama\u1e63 for \u1e62aidan = , but \u1e25iraq and \u1e25olam for the Phoenician city Sidon = . German theologian H.W. Kuhn, citing archaeologist Richard A. Freund (Freund 1995:267\u2013311), further supports this view, and writes: \"The Rabbinic literature in which Bethsaida appears, as already mentioned, is never called 'Julias', but rather speaks of '(Beth-)saida' ( = \u1e62aidan, etc.; [whereas]  = Beth \u1e63aidan, or anything similar, also does not appear in rabbinic texts), so like the canonical gospels, it uses this name for the village. From these texts I refer merely to one [village] presumably\" (Kuhn 2015:153). An anecdote has been passed down in the Midrash Rabba (Kohelet Rabba 2:11), where Hadrian asked Rabbi Yehoshua b. Hananiah about the preeminence of the Land of Israel over other lands, particularly where the Scripture (Deuteronomy 8:9) imputes of the country that it is \"a land wherein you shall eat bread without scarceness, [and] you shall not lack any thing therein.\" When asked whether or not the country could produce for him three things: peppercorns, pheasants (phasianum) and silk, the rabbi brought for him peppercorns from Nas\u1e25ana, pheasants from \u1e62aidan and silk from Gush Halav, \u2013 meaning, the place was reckoned as in the Land of Israel proper.In the Jerusalem Talmud (She\u1e33alim 6:2), after mentioning Lake Hulah and the Sea of Galilee, Saidan is then mentioned as a place where there was an abundance of different kinds of fish, as alluded to in Ezekiel 47:8\u201310, and where it was said of a certain river that \"their fish shall be after their kinds.\" Klein has speculated that this Saidan refers to Bethsaida along the Jordan River (Klein 1915:167\u2013168).

Herbert Danby, Arakhin 9:6 (p. 553 - note 11) Modern-day archaeologists have suggested that the fort was abandoned before the arrival of the Israelites, which, even if that were the case, has no bearing on the antiquity of the wall itself.
