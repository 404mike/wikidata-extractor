Having served in the British Army, he trained for Holy Orders at St Mary's College, Oscott, and worked as a Catholic priest until 1975.

In 1979, Thomas Michael Loome stressed the continuity between the two and talked of a \"vertical dimension\" of the modernist controversy. This \"invention of tradition\" was criticized - amongst others - by Nicholas Lash. It is clear, however, that already the Joint Pastoral of the English episcopate against \"Liberal Catholicism\" (December 1900) did not only react on St. George Jackson Mivart, but also on the writings of the later \"modernist\" George Tyrrell. The letter had been prepared in Rome and was inspired by Rafael Merry del Val who became Tyrrell's chief opponent under Pius X. Furthermore, \"modernists\" like Tyrrell compared their own difficulties after the publication of Pascendi with the difficulties of \"liberal catholics\" like Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger after Vatican I. In December 1907, Tyrrell wrote to a German correspondent: \"Is it not time to reconsider the pseudo-council of 1870 and to ask whether the Alt-Katholiks were not, after all, in the right? Ex fructibus eorum etc. [You will know them by their fruits. Matthew 7:16] may surely be used as a criterion of Ultramontanism. Individuals, like myself, can afford to stand aloof as D\u00f6llinger did. But can multitudes live without sacraments and external communion? And yet now no educated man or woman will be able to remain in communion with Pius X.\" Tyrrell was also inspired by the posthumous publication of Lord Acton's History of Freedom and Other Essays in 1907."]}, {"page": "The Varieties of Religious Experience", "response": ["In 1986, Nicholas Lash criticised James's Varieties, challenging James's separation of the personal and institutional. Lash argues that religious geniuses such as St. Paul or Jesus, with whom James was particularly interested, did not have their religious experiences in isolation but within and influenced by a social and historical context. Ultimately, Lash argues that this comes from James's failure to overcome Cartesian dualism in his thought: while James believed he had succeeded in surpassing Descartes, he was still tied to a notion of an internal ego, distinct from the body or outside world, which undergoes experiences."]}, {"page": "St Mary's College, Oscott", "response": ["*Nicholas Lash (1934\u20132020), theologian."]}, {"page": "The Furrow", "response": ["Contributors have included Cardinals Cahal Daly, Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich, Godfried Danneels, Walter Kasper and Leo Joseph Suenens; theologians such as Karl Rahner, Gabriel Daly, Rosemary Haughton, Enda McDonagh, Nicholas Lash and Mary Grey; political figures such as President Mary Robinson, President Mary McAleese, Garret FitzGerald and John Reid, and writers such as Seamus Heaney, Fr.

Pope Leo XIII never attempted to exercise infallibility and by the time of his death all the neo-ultramontane publications had been closed down or had changed their views on what was now \"history\" (the First Vatican Council and the debates within it). However, some liberal theologians and historians have argued since the beginning of John Paul II's papacy that a view of papal infallibility analogous to that proposed by neo-ultramontanes has made a comeback. This has been especially true since the controversy surrounding the aftermath of Ordinatio sacerdotalis in 1994 and \"On Not Inventing Doctrine\", Nicholas Lash's article in The Tablet about that letter published a year and a half later. However, neither Pope John Paul II nor Pope Benedict XVI have cited nineteenth-century neo-ultramontanists as influences on their theological or ecclesiological viewpoints."]}, {"page": "N. L. A.
