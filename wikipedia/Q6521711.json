Signed by Wolves in 1937 by the great Major Frank Buckley Sidlow was the first choice Wolves keeper both before the war. The rise of England great Bert Williams at Wolves after the war limited his chances, this included a notable international match between England and Wales at Ninian Park where Wolves supplied both the England Keeper (Williams) and Welsh keeper (Sidlow). With Wolves having two international keepers this led to Sidlow being surplus to requirements, but a recognised international, Liverpool manager George Kay signed him for a then record \u00a34000 in February 1946. Sidlow made his debut for Liverpool on 31 August 1946 in a league match at Bramall Lane, and kept his first clean sheet for the club, with Len Carney scoring a late goal for the Reds in the 90th minute."]}, {"page": "Bill Jones (footballer, born 1921)", "response": ["He made his debut for Liverpool, along with Len Carney and Cyril Sidlow, as a 25-year-old on the opening day of the 1946\u201347 season, against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane.
