The son of a prosperous and influential Scottish gentry family, he became a trader in India. Having made a fortune supplying the Royal Navy, he returned to Scotland to buy several landed estates, including Whittingehame in East Lothian where he built a classical mansion.\nBalfour became a Tory Member of Parliament (MP) from 1826 to 1834, but never achieved ministerial office.  However, many of his descendants found fame and success, including his grandson Arthur Balfour,\nwho served as prime minister from 1902 to 1905.\nAt his death, Balfour's estates in Scotland alone were estimated to be worth over \u00a31 million (equivalent to \u00a399.7 million in 2021).\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
