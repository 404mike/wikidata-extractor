In London he moved into the Soho bohemia where, with the poet David Wright, he founded and co-edited X magazine. In Portugal he continued painting while also writing and illustrating books on Portugal and founding Porches Pottery, which revived a dying industry. During his lifetime Swift had only two solo exhibitions. His first exhibition at the Waddington Gallery, Dublin, in 1952 was well acclaimed. For Swift, however, his art seems to have been a personal and private matter.\"Throughout his years in London, when he was right at the nerve centre of its art and literary life, he showed little interest in exhibiting his work.\" \u2014 Brian Fallon, \"Patrick Swift and Irish Art\", Patrick Swift: An Irish Painter in Portugal, Gandon Editions, 2001(first published: Portfolio 2 - Modern Irish Arts Review, Gandon Editions, Cork, 1993); \"Lucian Freud asks me if he is going to show in the new London Waddington\u2019s, I answer that I did not think so, that I do not think he is interested in exhibiting his paintings. We are both puzzled.\" \u2014 Anthony Cronin, Patrick Swift 1927-83, Gandon Editions Biography, 1993; \"And one day I found him in his underground flat in Westbourne Terrace busily taking down all his canvases (or rather hardboards, for in those days he couldn\u2019t afford canvas) from the walls and stowing them away in a cellar. His reason was: a millionaire art fancier had rung up to say he was calling and Swift did not want him to buy, or so much as see, his work.\" \u2014 David Wright, Patrick Swift 1927-83, Gandon Editions, 1993; \"In the world in which we all moved at that time, I used to be curious as to the detachment Paddy showed to the market place, at his indifference to the fashionable galleries where Freud and Bacon were the beckoning lights, along with Frank Auerbach; it was as if he'd taken Joyce's Stephen Daedalus to heart \u2014 that once the work is created, it is no longer anything to do with the artist, who simply stands aside and pares his nails.\" \u2014 Martin Green, Patrick Swift 1927-83, Gandon Editions, 1993;  \"Many people assumed he had stopped painting altogether\" \u2014 Brian Fallon, \"The fall and rise of Patrick Swift\", The Irish Times, 11 June 1992 In 1993 the Irish Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective of Swift's work.", "In Dublin and London he partook of artistic and, always, literary life,\"He moved to London, a melting pot of cultural and artistic ideas. At home in 'the Bohemian jungle of Soho', he partook of artistic and, always, literary life.\" \u2014 Aidan Dunne, \"The lost hope of Irish art\", The Sunday Tribune, 28 November 1993 and from early on was involved with literary magazines.\"From early on Swift was associated with literary magazines, wrote for them and even co-edited \u2014 with David Wright \u2014 the literary periodical X, which was launched in London in 1959 and ran until 1961. Not much of a run, perhaps, but it had a remarkably distinguished list of contributors, including Beckett and Giacometti ...\" \u2014 \"The fall and rise of Patrick Swift\", Brian Fallon, The Irish Times, 11 June 1992 In London he founded and co-edited, with the poet David Wright, X magazine, for which he contributed articles under the pseudonym \"James Mahon\" (Swift's mother was a Mahon from Co. Wicklow). Wright  declared Swift to be \"the true begetter and leading light of X\",David Wright's Introduction to An Anthology from X (Oxford University Press, 1988) noting that he \"was of course responsible for the art side of the magazine ... nor was he any less active on the literary side of the magazine. Here Swift and I worked in perfect harmony.\" Aside from his involvement with X magazine, Swift was instrumental in several writers and poets having their work published, such as Patrick Kavanagh,Swift believed in Kavanagh and promoted him. John Ryan:\"Swift, in fact, made a decided impact on Kavanagh. It is hard to believe now that it was mainly a cultural impact and that he actually changed the older man's entire approach to poetry.\" (Patrick Swift 1927-83, Gandon Editions, 1993) Swift was responsible for Kavanagh having 19 poems published in the London-based literary magazine, Nimbus, in 1956, which proved to be the turning point in Kavanagh's career; his next volume of verse, Come Dance with Kitty Stobling, was to be directly linked to the mini-collection in Nimbus. Antoinette Quinn (Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography, Gill & Macmillan, 2001): \"Publication there [in Nimbus] was to prove a turning point \u2026 The publication of his next volume of verse, Come Dance with Kitty Stobling, was to be directly linked to the mini-collection in Nimbus, and his Collected Poems (1964)\". David Wright (then editor of Nimbus) in his introduction to An Anthology from X (OUP, 1988): \"These poems [19 of Kavanagh's poems were published] had been posted to me by Swift, whose brother James had invaded the poet's flat in Dublin, gathered up the trampled manuscripts scattered about the floor, and had them sorted, typed, and bound. One of the carbon copies was sent to me.\" Antoinette Quinn (Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography), however,  says that the idea of Jimmy Swift invading the poet's flat is a myth. Quinn states that Kavanagh had a typescript rejected by Macmillan's (\"Macmillan's rejection had left him very downcast\") and that subsequently Swift, on one of his trips to Dublin, \"was invited to peruse the contents and decided that the poems should be published. He had to return to London\u2026 but persuaded Kavanagh to entrust the precious typescript to his brother, Jimmy, to have three copies professionally typed up...[Jimmy,] acting under his brothers instructions... sent one copy each to David Wright and Martin Green in London\" (Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography, Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2001, pp. 350-351). Wright's version of events is, no doubt, the story put out by Swift himself, and one which would not have displeased Kavanagh. Swift was also instrumental in the publication of Kavanagh's Collected Poems (1964). Martin Green (who put together the collection for MacGibbon and Kee in 1964): \"It was following the suggestion of the painter Patrick Swift and the poet Anthony Cronin that the publication came about.\"( Martin Green in a letter to The Guardian, 2005; see also Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography, Antoinette Quinn, Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2001, p. 359.) Kavanagh would often stay with Swift and his family at 9 Westbourne Terrace. Regarding their friendship, Antoinette Quinn says, \"Swift believed in his genius and indulged him and... the older man... came to lean on Swift as a beloved nephew.\"(Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography, p: 297) Kavanagh would often stay with Swift and his family at 9 Westbourne Terrace: \"In London he generally stayed with the Swifts\" (Antoinette Quinn, Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography).

Sisson, Brian Higgins and David Wright.For Martin Green Swift was something of a catalyst: \"It was he, together with Tony Cronin, who initially put up the idea of bringing together Kavanagh's poems for the Collected Poems\u2026 Paddy Swift had a catalytic enthusiasm that ignited a response elsewhere. I remember being introduced by him to John McGahern who was first published in X magazine \u2026 which I recommended for publication but was overruled ... It was he who brought to my attention the Charles Sisson version of Catullus, which I subsequently published \u2026 It was he who helped to find a publisher for Brian Higgins ...\" (Patrick Swift 1927-83, Gandon Editions, 1993) David Wright regarding Swift promoting his own work: \"Swift and Cronin... brought me to the attention of the publisher Derek Verschoyle \u2014 and this was typical of Swift, who would take immense pains to push the product of anybody whose work he believed in, yet never bothered to promote his own.\"", "* Selected Poems, Homage to George Barker (On his Sixtieth Birthday), John Heath-Stubbs & Martin Green, -eds, Martin Brian & O'Keefe Ltd (1973); includes Swift's portrait of Barker and Swift's essay on Barker, \"Prolegomenon to George Barker\".", "* \"Prolegomenon to George Barker\", X, vol.
