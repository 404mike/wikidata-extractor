The son of former Scotland international Alex Munro, Munro Jr. represented Glasgow Schoolboys as a child before joining Bristol Rovers as a seventeen-year-old, following a successful trial.\nMunro initially played as a left half, but was soon moved to outside left where he was a regular between 1966 and 1968. Later in his career he was converted to a left back, a position where he broke his leg in the Gloucestershire Cup final in May 1968, but after a year he had recovered sufficiently to play in the position regularly until he was replaced by Lindsay Parsons in 1970.\nFollowing the loss of his position at Bristol Rovers, Munro moved to South Africa in 1971, when he joined Durban City. He went on to play for Durham City and East London, both also in South Africa, before retiring from football. He remained in the country until 2007, when he moved back to England to live in Cornwall, dying in St Austell on 24 May 2009.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Munro", "response": ["*Alex Munro (comedian) (1911\u20131986), Scottish actor and comedian", "*Alex Munro (footballer, born 1912) (1912\u20131986), Scottish footballer", "*Alex Munro (footballer, born 1944) (1944\u20132009), Scottish footballer", "*Alex Munro, a character in Star Trek: Voyager \u2013 Elite Force"]}, {"page": "Alex Munro (footballer born 1944)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alex Munro (footballer, born 1944)"]}]}}
