He attended Eton College and then proceeded to the Slade School of Art, under the tutelage of Henry Tonks. A fellow student was the actor Ernest Thesiger, who became a lifelong friend; he was painted by Ranken in 1918, and married Ranken's sister Janette Ranken in 1917.Ranken's first exhibition in 1904 at the Carfax Gallery (managed by John Fothergill and William Rothenstein) in London was well received by artists and art critics.

Besides Osbert Sitwell, another friend of royalty, the celebrated interior designer Elsie de Wolfe (known in Britain as Lady Mendle) had lesbian affairs. The society architect Philip Tilden was a homosexual, as was his patron Philip Sassoon, whose house at Port Lympne, had many Curzon Street baroque features. Patrons of the style often had both their portraits and rooms painted by the homosexual artist William Bruce Ellis Ranken. Whatever the truth of the term, no designer or patron of \"Buggers' Baroque\" was ever likely to challenge the accusation as discretion was the key to survival: when William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, known in society circles to be homosexual, was publicly exposed as a homosexual by his brother-in-law the Duke of Westminster in 1931, he had no option but to flee the country to avoid arrest, spending the remainder of his life in exile. Westminster later wrote him a letter beginning \"Dear Bugger-in-Law.\"A. L. Rowse, Homosexuals in History (1977), pp. 222\u2013223 ", "*William Bruce Ellis Ranken (1881\u20131941)"]}]}}
