He was an all-rounder: a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler.\nAlan Peach was born at Maidstone, Kent.  World War I delayed his first-class debut until 1919, when he was already 28, but in a career that extended until 1931 he still managed to take 795 wickets at 26.58 and score 8940 runs at 23.71. The highest of his four hundreds was 200 not out, made against Northamptonshire at Northampton in 1920, when he shared in a stand of 171 in forty-two minutes with Percy Fender. A notably hard striker of the ball, in 1924 he hit balls from both Bates of Glamorgan and Newman of Hampshire clean out of The Oval. During the same season, he dismissed four Sussex batsmen with consecutive balls, also at The Oval, finishing with eight wickets for 60, his best innings analysis.\nHe played six times for the Players against the Gentlemen between 1923 and 1928.\nHe was Surrey coach from 1935 to 1939 and discovered Alec and Eric Bedser.  He died at North End, Newbury, Hampshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Alan Peach"]}, {"page": "Alec Bedser", "response": ["After leaving school, Eric and Alec became clerks at the same firm of solicitors in Lincoln's Inn Fields.  They were spotted practising in the nets for Woking Cricket Club by Surrey coach Alan Peach, and he recruited them to the staff at the Oval in 1938.  Initially, they were both medium-fast bowlers, but (after Alec won a toss of a coin) Eric became an off spinner instead.  They made their first-class d\u00e9buts for Surrey against Oxford University in June 1939."]}, {"page": "Eric Bedser", "response": ["The Bedser brothers began playing cricket together at age seven for local school sides and Woking Cricket Club. Both twins also played football for Surrey Boys, and considered a professional career in that sport. They were educated at Maybury Junior School and Monument Hill Central School. From the age of 14, the twins worked as clerks at a solicitor's office in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They were spotted by Surrey coach Alan Peach in 1938 and joined the Surrey county squad staff at the Oval, making their first-class debuts in the same match in June 1939. There is a famous story that when Eric and Alec were first selected for Surrey, they agreed they couldn't both be fast bowlers, as at that time they were. A flip of the coin saw Alec win the toss, and Eric consequently took up off-spin bowling, at which he became very adept in a Surrey county team that was dominated by famous spinners such as Jim Laker and Tony Lock, and concentrated on his batting."]}, {"page": "Percy Fender", "response": ["Against Northamptonshire in one of the last games of the 1920 season, Surrey had passed Northamptonshire's score and were in a dominant position when Fender batted. He was dropped early on but batting in a carefree, highly aggressive style, reached 100 runs in 35 minutes, as of 2021 still the fastest individual century on record in first-class cricket. In total, he scored 113 not out and shared a partnership of 171 runs in 42 minutes with Alan Peach.Streeton, pp. 85\u201392. Although acknowledged to be a fast innings, Fender's century was not recognised as a record at the time; cricket records were not widely kept or studied, and other innings were believed to have been quicker. Surrey went on to win the match."]}, {"page": "Douai School", "response": ["External fixtures, which were unknown at old Douai, were soon organized after the move to England. Cricket and hockey were played at the new school from 1905, and from 1918 to 1919 rugby union replaced soccer as the main winter sport (soccer returned as a minor sport in 1962). In 1920, the Trinidadian Louis Wharton became Douai's first Oxford University cricketer, having won a Blue for soccer the previous year. He went on to play cricket for Somerset. After the war the Surrey all-rounder Alan Peach was cricket coach, succeeded by Frank Shipston of Nottinghamshire. An indoor swimming pool was built in 1937."]}, {"page": "Peach (surname)", "response": ["* Alan Peach (1890\u20131961), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Sidney Stretton", "response": ["Stretton made a single first-class appearance for Northamptonshire against Surrey at the County Ground, Northampton in the 1928 County Championship.
