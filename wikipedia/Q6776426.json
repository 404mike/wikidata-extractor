He played in the blues rock band Steamhammer, formed in 1968. Their debut album Steamhammer was released in 1969.\nQuittenton also worked with Rod Stewart, along with Pete Sears, Micky Waller, and fellow Steamhammer guitarist Martin Pugh. In collaboration with Stewart, Quittenton co-wrote the international hit singles \"Maggie May\" and \"You Wear It Well\", along with the British top ten single \"Farewell\", from Stewart's 1974 album Smiler. Stewart invited Quittenton to join his group The Faces, but Quittenton was not attracted by the wild off-stage antics for which the Faces were notorious.In 1973, Quittenton formed an instrumental band with Pete Sears, Manfred Mann drummer John Lingwood and keyboardist Max Middleton. The band never got beyond the rehearsal stage.Suffering from mental health problems, Quittenton left the music business and moved to Llanrhyddlad, on the isle of Anglesey, Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rod Stewart", "response": ["An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down became Stewart's first solo album in 1969 (it was known as The Rod Stewart Album in the US). It established the template for his solo sound: a heartfelt mixture of folk, rock, and country blues, inclusive of a British working-class sensibility, with both original material (\"Cindy's Lament\" and the title song) and cover versions (Ewan MacColl's \"Dirty Old Town\" and Mike d'Abo's \"Handbags and Gladrags\"). The backing band on the album included Wood, Waller and McLagan, plus Keith Emerson and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer, and later Armageddon and 7th Order) and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).", "Stewart's 1971 solo album Every Picture Tells a Story made him a household name when the B-side of his minor hit \"Reason to Believe\", \"Maggie May\", (co-written with Martin Quittenton) started receiving radio play. The album and the single occupied the number one chart position simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, a chart first, in September.Marcus, Greil. The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll. Second edition; Jim Miller, editor. New York: Random House, 1980, , p. 379. Maggie May topped the single chart for five weeks in the US, and the UK and four weeks in Australia.  Set off by a striking mandolin part (by Ray Jackson of Lindisfarne), \"Maggie May\" was also named in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, one of three songs by him to appear on that list. The rest of the album was equally strong, with \"Mandolin Wind\" again showcasing that instrument; \"(I Know) I'm Losing You\" adding hard-edged soul to the mix; and \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\", a cover of a Bob Dylan song. But the ultimate manifestation of the early Stewart solo style was the Stewart-Wood-penned \"Every Picture Tells a Story\" itself: powered by Mick Waller's drumming, Pete Sears's piano and Wood's guitar work in a largely acoustic arrangement; it is a song relating to the picaresque adventures of the singer."]}, {"page": "Faces (band)", "response": ["The first collaboration among the future Faces was in a formation called Quiet Melon, which also featured Wood's older brother Art Wood and Kim Gardner; they recorded four songs and played a few shows in May 1969, during a break in Ronnie Wood's and Rod Stewart's commitments with The Jeff Beck Group. Later that summer Wood and Stewart parted ways with Beck and joined Lane, McLagan and Jones full-time.
