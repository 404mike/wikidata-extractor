Prior to its selection as a commonly agreed central datum point, various points were used for this purpose. John Ogilby's Britannia of 1675, of which editions and derivations continued to be published throughout the 18th century, used the \"Standard\" (a former conduit head) in Cornhill; while John Cary's New Itinerary of 1798 used the General Post Office in Lombard Street. The milestones on the principal turnpike roads were generally measured from the terminus of the individual road, mostly on the perimeter of the metropolitan area: these points included Hyde Park Corner, Whitechapel Church, the southern end of London Bridge, the southern end of Westminster Bridge, Shoreditch Church, Tyburn Turnpike, Holborn Bars, St Giles's Pound, Hicks Hall (the terminus of the Great North Road), and the Stones' End in The Borough. Some roads into Surrey and Sussex were measured from St Mary-le-Bow church. Some of these structures had been moved or destroyed, but their former locations continued to be used for distances. The result was that \"all the Books of Roads ... published, differ in the Situation of Mile Stones, and instead of being a Guide to the Traveller, serve only to confound him\"."]}, {"page": "William Smith (geologist)", "response": ["In 1801, he drew a rough sketch of what would become the first geological map of most of Great Britain. Smith travelled extensively across Great Britain working as a mineral surveyor allowing him to meet prominent people such as Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, and the Duke of Bedford. In 1815 he published this geological map, based on a John Cary map. It covered the whole of England and Wales, and parts of Scotland. While this was not the world's first geological map (a map of the United States by William Maclure was published six years earlier),1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia BritannicaGreene, J.C.  and Burke, J.G. (1978) \u201cThe Science of Minerals in the Age of Jefferson\u201d. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series, Vol. 68, No. 4, pp. 1\u2013113 [39] Smith's was the first geological map covering such a large area in detail, and is one of the first stratigraphical analyses to utilize paleontological indices. Conventional symbols were used to mark canals, tunnels, tramways and roads, collieries, lead, copper and tin mines, together with salt and alum works. The various geological types were indicated by different colours, applied by hand. Nevertheless, the map is remarkably similar to modern geological maps of England. It also included a 'Sketch of the succession of STRATA and their relative Altitudes'. This geological cross-section was not a new technique in itself, but its appearance on a map, with the clear intention of illustrating the relationship between relief and rocks and their structure, was novel. He published his Delineation of the Strata of England in the same year. In another of his books Strata Identified by Organized Fossils (London 1816\u20131819) he recognised that strata contained distinct fossil assemblages which could be used to match rocks across regions (Smith's laws). In 1817 he drew a remarkable geological section from Snowdon to London, a development of the \u2018sketch\u2019 on his map, illustrating the three-dimensional relationship between geology and landscape via a perspective sketch of the landscape showing the topography.
