On 1 January 1965 he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for services to football) whilst still an active professional player; though he never thought himself worthy of such an honour. His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated by injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3\u20131.

Though Conroy only made nine league appearances in the 1967\u201368 season, he was present on the final day 2\u20131 win over Liverpool which kept Stoke out of the First Division relegation zone. He was again registered with the Cleveland Stokers \u2013 now in the North American Soccer League \u2013 in the summer of 1968, but did not play a first team game for the club. He started to become a first team regular for Stoke in the 1968\u201369 season after scoring against Liverpool at Anfield on 20 August, and went on to score in four consecutive games over the Christmas period. Waddington did though sometimes prefer to play John Mahoney to Conroy, using Mahoney as an extra defensive midfielder to make Stoke more solid defensively. Conroy also damaged cartilage in his knee after being challenged heavily by Manchester City's left-half Alan Oakes in a 3\u20131 defeat at Maine Road on 29 March, and was ruled out of action for five months. After recovering he went on to make 33 appearances in the 1969\u201370 campaign, and got some measure of revenge over Manchester City at Maine Road on 17 January by scoring the only goal of the game after dribbling past three defenders from the half-way line."]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "1962\u201363 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "1967\u201368 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gerry Bridgwood"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 in English football", "response": ["*2 March 2012: Gerry Bridgwood, 67, former Shrewsbury Town and Stoke City midfielder."]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Gerry Bridgwood, 67, footballer (Stoke City)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2012", "response": ["*Gerry Bridgwood, 67, English footballer (Stoke City), heart attack."]}, {"page": "Gerald Bridgwood", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerry Bridgwood"]}]}}
