S. Eliot's The Waste Land, and for his book Style (1955; revised 1962), an acclaimed guide to recognising and writing good prose. His Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's 'Poetics' (1927, substantially revised in 1957) was for over fifty years a standard introduction. His most important contribution to scholarship was his four-volume old-spelling Complete Works of John Webster (1927), the first collected edition of the Jacobean dramatist since that of Hazlitt the Younger (1857), itself an inferior copy of Dyce (1830). Eliot called Lucas \"the perfect annotator\", and subsequent Webster scholars have been indebted to him, notably the editors of the new Cambridge Webster (1995\u20132007).Lucas is also remembered for his anti-fascist campaign in the 1930s, and for his wartime work at Bletchley Park, for which he received the OBE.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Theseus", "response": ["* F.

Eliot said that \"to have the virtues of good prose is the first and minimum requirement of good poetry.\" Critic Arthur Pollard believes that Crabbe definitely met this qualification. Critic William Caldwell Roscoe, answering William Hazlitt's question of why Crabbe had not in fact written prose rather than verse said \"have you ever read Crabbe's prose? Look at his letters, especially the later ones, look at the correct but lifeless expression of his dedications and prefaces\u2014then look at his verse, and you will see how much he has exceeded 'the minimum requirement of good poetry'.\" The critic F. L. Lucas summed up Crabbe's qualities: \"na\u00efve, yet shrewd; straightforward, yet sardonic; blunt, yet tender; quiet, yet passionate; realistic, yet romantic.\" Crabbe, who is seen as a complicated poet, has been and often still is dismissed as too narrow in his interests and in his way of responding to them in his poetry. \"At the same time as the critic is making such judgments, he is all too often aware that Crabbe, nonetheless, defies classification\", says Pollard."]}, {"page": "John Webster", "response": ["*The short story 'A Christmas in Padua' in F.

His statement (9.5.6) that the Thetideion, the temple to Thetis south of Scotussa, was \u201cnear both the Pharsaloi, the Old and the New\u201d, seems to imply that Palaeopharsalos was not itself close by Pharsalos. Although the battle of 48 BC is called after Pharsalos, four ancient writers \u2013 the author of the Bellum Alexandrinum (48.1), Frontinus (Strategemata 2.3.22), Eutropius (20), and Orosius (6.15.27) \u2013 place it specifically at Palaeopharsalos. In 198 B.C. Philip V had sacked Palaeopharsalos (Livy 32.13.9).
