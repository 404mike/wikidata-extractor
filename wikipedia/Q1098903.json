A second trial found him not guilty, after experts opined that there was no insulin injection and that her symptoms were attributable to over-use of prescription drugs. The story was dramatized in the book and movie Reversal of Fortune.

While no foul play was suspected at the time, Claus von B\u00fclow was later accused of causing this incident by injecting her with insulin. In April 1980, she was again hospitalized after appearing incoherent and disoriented; their doctors reconfirmed she suffered from \"reactive hypoglycemia\".

She was taken to the hospital where it became clear that this time she had suffered severe enough brain injury to produce a persistent vegetative state. Although clinical features resembled a drug overdose, some of the laboratory evidence suggested hypoglycemia. The Court of Appeal ordered disclosure of the notes taken by the Auersperg children's attorney. These showed that Claus von B\u00fclow did not want to terminate life support, as had been alleged.", "Because of the increased marital tensions between Claus and Sunny von B\u00fclow in the fall of 1980, her children were suspicious that her brain injury was the result of foul play by him.

Dershowitz and his other attorneys produced evidence of Sunny von B\u00fclow's excessive drug use, including testimony by both Truman Capote and Joanne Carson (second wife of Johnny Carson) and more than ten of Sunny's friends. Some of the expert witness testimony was excluded as hypothetical or hearsay. Additional expert witness testimony cast doubt on the validity of evidence that a syringe contained traces of insulin. The appeals court quashed the conviction on several grounds, including the appellate court's ruling that justice for the accused should override attorney\u2013client privilege; and that therefore the notes taken by Kuh, the Auersperg children's attorney, should be disclosed.
