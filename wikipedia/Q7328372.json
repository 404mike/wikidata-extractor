The company fractured for a time, but in 1637 was reconstituted at the Salisbury Court Theatre, with several veterans, including Turner, as continuing members. Turner apparently won a leading position in the troupe; on 6 March 1640, when the Queen's Men were paid \u00a380 for seven Court performances in the previous two years, Turner was the member who received the payment. On 8 January 1641, Turner and leading man Richard Perkins received royal liveries for fourteen members of the company."]}, {"page": "Richard Perkins", "response": ["Richard Perkins may refer to:", "*Richard Perkins (actor) (c. 1585\u20131650), English actor", "*Richard Perkins (scientist), United States nuclear physicist", "*Richard Perkins (figure skater), Canadian Olympic ice dancer", "*Richard Perkins (politician) (born 1961), Nevada State Assembly leader", "*Richard Perkins of Ufton, a member of the Perkins family of Ufton, Berkshire, England"]}, {"page": "Richard Perkins (17th-century actor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Perkins (actor)"]}]}}
