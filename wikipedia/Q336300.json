Despite this defeat, he was able to score several victories against the Zulus, culminating the British victory at the Battle of Ulundi, which ended the war and partly restored his reputation in Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1905", "response": ["* April 9 \u2013 Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, British general (b. 1827)"]}, {"page": "1827", "response": ["* May 31 \u2013 Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, British general (d. 1905)"]}, {"page": "Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial", "response": ["With the outbreak of the Zulu War in 1879, the Prince Imperial, with the rank of lieutenant, forced the hand of the British military to allow him to take part in the conflict, despite the objections of Rouher and other Bonapartists. He was only allowed to go to Africa by special pleading of his mother, the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, and by intervention of Queen Victoria herself. He went as an observer, attached to the staff of Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, the commander in South Africa, who was admonished to take care of him.  Louis accompanied Chelmsford on his march into Zululand.  Keen to see action, and full of enthusiasm, he was warned by Lieutenant Arthur Brigge, a close friend, \"not to do anything rash and to avoid running unnecessary risks.  I reminded him of the Empress at home and his party in France.\""]}, {"page": "Anglo-Zulu War", "response": ["The pretext for the war had its origins in border disputes between the Zulu leader, Cetshwayo, and the Boers in the Transvaal region. Following a commission inquiry on the border dispute which reported in favour of the Zulu nation in July 1878, Sir Henry Bartle Frere, acting on his own, added an ultimatum to the commission meeting, much to the surprise of the Zulu representatives who then relayed it to Cetshwayo.  Cetshwayo had not responded by the end of the year, so an extension was granted by Bartle Frere until 11 January 1879. Cetshwayo returned no answer to the  demands of Bartle Frere, and in January 1879 a British force under Lieutenant General Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford invaded Zululand, without authorization by the British Government. The exact date of the invasion was 11 January 1879. Chelmsford crossed the Buffalo River at Rorke's Drift, an old Irish trader's post that had become a mission station, in command of 4,700 men, which included 1,900 White troops and 2,400 African auxiliaries."]}, {"page": "Chelmsford (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, known for command during the Anglo-Zulu War"]}, {"page": "Stephen Ward", "response": ["Born in Lemsford, Hertfordshire, Stephen Ward was the second son of Arthur Evelyn Ward, Vicar of Lemsford, and Eileen Esm\u00e9e, the daughter of Thomas Mercer Cliffe Vigors.

He had done so despite an incident during his career that might have ruined his chances of promotion. This related to the defeat of British forces by the Zulu at the Battle of Isandhlwana in 1889, a reversal that was largely blamed on Colonel Anthony Durnford. However, it was rumoured that Durnford's orders had been stolen from his body after the battle, in order to absolve Lieutenant-General Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford and other senior officers of incompetence."]}, {"page": "Eric Thesiger", "response": ["He was the fourth son of Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford and his wife Adria Fanny Heath, daughter of Major-General John Coussamker Heath.
