He is known for winning the 1969 Madrid Grand Prix in a Formula 5000 car in a field which contained several Formula One entries. He was also a regular competitor in the British Formula 5000 Championship finishing third in the title standings on two occasions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1974 BRDC International Trophy", "response": ["|  Keith Holland"]}, {"page": "Lola T332", "response": ["The T332 dominated the last three years of the US F5000 championship, with Briton Brian Redman taking the title three times in a row in 1974\u201376, his most serious rivals Al Unser and Mario Andretti, in 1974\u201375 in Parnelli T332C. Australian driver Warwick Brown used a T332 to win the 1975 Tasman Series as well as the 1975 New Zealand Grand Prix. In doing so he became the only Australian driver to ever win the Tasman Series. New Zealand driver Ken Smith also used a Lola T332 to win the 1976 New Zealand Grand Prix. Ken Smith had obtained Redman's 1974 US winning chassis and a couple of extremely powerful US F5000 chev engines. Lawrence, after a serious accident in the 72 NZGP regained competitive form in a new T332 in the 1974 Tasman and by 1975 had upgraded his chassis to the specs of Andretti's US car and running with real sponsorship from Malboro, Singapore Airlines and Wix, was Warwick Brown's most serious rival during the 1975 Tasman.  As a side note, both the 1975 and 1976 New Zealand Grands Prix were held at Pukekohe Park Raceway. It was generally thought in the 1975 Tasman the two best drivers, Graham MacRae in a MacRae GM2 and Chris Amon in a Talon (a modified version of the GM2) were very much at a disadvantage compared with Lawrence, Brown and Smith in the Lola 332T, although to some extent that was compensated by the very fast Firestone F5000 tyres used by McRae for the last time in NZ which meant MacRae took pole or deadheated for pole time in the four kiwi rounds of the last Tasman. MacRae himself found his own T332 far faster than his GM2 in the 1974/75 US Travellers Cheque F5000 series. Although not able to equal the engine preparation of the Haas or Parnelli teams running at F1 level, even in 1975 at Watkins Geln, Lagua Seca and Long Beach, McRae in a T332 was still as quick as Jarier or Unser while his T332 lasted. In Australasia the T400 never matched the T332 although after its disastrous 1975 series, Max Stewarts T400 was often competitive in 1976 and 1977. In the Shellsport F5000 series in 1975, Peter Gethin and Pilete's T400 was probably quicker than the best T332s of Guy Edwards and Ian Ashley and in 1976 Keith Holland in a T400 often matched Edward's and David Purley 3.6 March and Chevron cars. The last two new T332c F5000s in 1977 were built for Alan Jones for the 1977 Australian Tasman rounds and Keith Holland Shellsport campaign that year."]}, {"page": "1977 Shellsport International Series", "response": ["|  Keith Holland", "|  Keith Holland", "|style=\"text-align:left\"|  Keith Holland"]}, {"page": "1975 ShellSPORT 5000 European Championship", "response": ["| Keith Holland"]}, {"page": "Keith Holland (racing driver)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Keith Holland"]}]}}
