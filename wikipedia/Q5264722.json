His original flying assignment was to 3 Wing to fly Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutters. During Bloody April 1917, he was assigned to Raymond Collishaw's Black Flight of Sopwith Triplanes. On 21 May 1917, he opened his scorebook by destroying an Albatros D.III over Ypres Staden. On 2 June, he cooperated with Collishaw, Ellis Vair Reid, and William Melville Alexander in forcing down a German observation plane. On the 5th, Nash again joined Collishaw and Reid, as well Desmond Fitzgibbon and another pilot, in another victory; this time, they set an Albatros reconnaissance plane aflame. The next day, Nash destroyed another Albatros recon plane, and sent down two Albatros D.III's out of control. On 25 June 1917, Nash was shot down behind enemy lines in Belgium by Karl Allmenr\u00f6der and became a prisoner of war. He was repatriated after war's end, and returned to Canada in 1919.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/canada/nash1.php Retrieved 18 February 2010."]}, {"page": "Fitzgibbon", "response": ["* Desmond Fitzgibbon (1890after 1945), British flying ace in the Royal Naval Air Service during World War I"]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Desmond Fitzgibbon"]}, {"page": "Desmond Fitzgerald Fitzgibbon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Desmond Fitzgibbon "]}]}}
