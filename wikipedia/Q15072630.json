Cornet Bankes led three charges against a body of rebels who had rushed the guns in the vicinity of Moosa-Bagh. In the course of these charges the young officer was almost cut to pieces. He died of his wounds 18 days later.\nAs Bankes was dying Queen Victoria wrote of his plight in a letter to the Princess Royal:\n\nThere is a poor young man - of the name Bankes - who has been cut almost to pieces - he fell and was surrounded by a set of fanatics who cut at him, his thigh was nearly severed from his body - and so was his arm! Besides six other desperate wounds! He has had his right leg and his right arm amputated - and yet they hope he will live. This is, they say, the pattern of patience and fortitude.\nBankes was awarded the VC when the award criteria for the medal was amended to allow posthumous awards.", "link_mentions": {}}}
