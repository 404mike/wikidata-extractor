He longed to get back to operational flying but could not, as he could not ask Air Vice Marshall Carr to reverse his promotion to Group Captain, and with such a rank no flying position was available. A possible 'out' arose when the AOC of the PFF, Don Bennett, arrived at his airfield to tour his station. Cheshire approached Bennett and asked permission to transfer to the Pathfinder Force. Bennett was not receptive. He replied that at present no jobs were available. Regardless, he was not sure if Cheshire would be suitable and a trial would be necessary. Cheshire was not pleased, and said so. It is not known why Bennett did not want Cheshire in the Pathfinder Force. It was not the first time Bennett had passed on Cheshire. Bennett's primary recruiting officer, Hamish Mahaddie, found it a mystery. Mahaddie said \"Chesh was the only person I selected for training with the Pathfinder Force that Bennett vetoed. I was never able to establish why.\" In the end Cheshire viewed the refusal as a blessing in disguise. \"He did me a good turn, because I got something better.\""]}, {"page": "Blackbushe Airport", "response": ["The airport passed into private ownership and was formally reopened as a general aviation field on 6 October 1962.
