A subterfuge to destroy Daleks aligned to Davros; both on Skaro (Antalin) and those that remained hidden within Dalek ranks on Skaro (original).  Despite finding evidence of threat to Skaro via evidence found on 22nd century earth of Davros' mission to 1960s Earth and seeing the event via time-tracking equipment, the Dalek Prime allowed the destruction of Skaro to destroy Daleks allied to Davros. Dalek Prime also claimed that the Dalek/Movellan war (and indeed most of Dalek history before the destruction of \"Skaro\") was actually faked for Davros' benefit; in fact another ruse designed to bait Davros into giving evidence against himself (as he does in his trial.)

This sequence implies that the attack on Cloudbase really happened, whereas in the original episode, it is a nightmare dreamt by an unconscious Symphony Angel. According to Fred McNamara, \"Attack on Cloudbase\" was \"unforgivably butchered\" by these alterations. Noting that the original series' last episode did not show an end to the war between Earth and Mars, writer John Peel suggests that the material from \"Attack on Cloudbase\" was changed to give the story a more satisfactory conclusion. He is negative in his assessment of the film: \"The grafting of the new ending isn't too well done, and the whole thing looks totally faked.\""]}]}}
