It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; and it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload.. Keats's long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy's Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that, at this point, Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor.
