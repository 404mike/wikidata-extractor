By arrangement parts of the estates, including Brynkinalt in Wales, passed to Lord Edwin, who assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Trevor. In 1880 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Trevor, of Brynkinalt in the County of Denbigh.\nAs Lord Edwin Hill-Trevor, Lord Trevor was a Captain in the North Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry, promoted Major in 1862, but retired from the regiment prior to its amalgamation into the unified Shropshire Yeomanry regiment in 1872.Lord Trevor married, firstly, Mary Emily, daughter of Sir Richard Sutton, 2nd Baronet, in 1848.
