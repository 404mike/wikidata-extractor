A strong centre-forward with excellent all-round attacking skills, he was able to head the ball with tremendous power and accuracy.Born in Farnworth and raised in Bolton, he played amateur football at Rossendale United, before he turned professional at Burnley on his 17th birthday. He also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club, before his potential as a footballer won him a \u00a36,500 move to Everton in January 1937. He went on to finish as the First Division's top-scorer in 1938 and 1939, helping Everton to finish as champions of the Football League in the latter campaign. League football was then suspended for seven full seasons due to the outbreak of war in Europe, during which time he scored 24 goals in 23 appearances for England whilst guesting for Everton and a number of other clubs. In November 1945, he moved to Chelsea for \u00a314,000, and scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946\u201347 season.In November 1947, he made a surprise move to Third Division South club Notts County for a British record transfer fee of \u00a320,000. He helped the club to win promotion as champions in 1949\u201350, before he moved on to Brentford in March 1952 for a club record \u00a316,000. In January 1953, Brentford appointed him player-manager, though he would only remain in charge for nine months. He joined Arsenal as a player in November 1953 for \u00a310,000, where he saw out the remainder of his playing career. Despite losing much of his best years to World War II, he scored 260 goals in 433 league and cup competitions in 14 full seasons in the Football League.He had a promising start to his managerial career by leading Kettering Town to the Southern League title in 1956\u201357, but then only had two more seasons as manager, getting relegated with Notts County in 1957\u201358 and then relegated with Kettering Town in 1963\u201364. During the 1970s he struggled with debt and related legal problems, which were reported in the media as an example of a celebrated person having fallen from grace.He scored 22 goals in his 23 England appearances over a ten-year international career from 1938 to 1948, including four against Portugal in May 1947. He helped England to win two British Home Championship titles outright (1946\u201347 and 1947\u201348), and to share the Championship in 1938\u201339. He fell out of international contention at the age of 28 due to his contempt for manager Walter Winterbottom, his decision to drop out of the First Division, and the emergence of Jackie Milburn and Nat Lofthouse. As well as his England caps, he also represented The Football League XI and played in a special Great Britain game against Europe in 1947. He married twice, and had two children and one step-child. His ashes are held in the National Football Museum, and he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 6", "response": ["*1919 \u2013 Tommy Lawton, English footballer and coach (d. 1996)"]}, {"page": "1996", "response": ["* November 6 \u2013 Tommy Lawton, English footballer and manager (b. 1919)"]}, {"page": "Everton F.C.", "response": ["*  Tommy Lawton (2003 inductee)", "*  Tommy Lawton"]}, {"page": "Stanley Matthews", "response": ["On 15 April 1939, he returned to a muddy Hampden Park with England to claim a 2\u20131 victory in front of 142,000 rain-soaked supporters; he set up Tommy Lawton for the winner with seconds to spare. That summer was the last time the England would tour Europe before Hitler's Nazis were defeated. The first game was against Italy, who gave the English a warm reception despite Benito Mussolini's breast-beating and the bad blood of five years previous. Again the World Champions, the Italians managed to salvage a 2\u20132 draw at the San Siro after scoring with a clear handball; this time Matthews left the field with a chipped hip bone for his efforts. The next game was a 2\u20131 loss to Yugoslavia, with Matthews and captain Eddie Hapgood passengers in the game after picking up early injuries; this injury forced him to sit out the following encounter with Romania."]}, {"page": "Greenock Morton F.C.", "response": ["During the Second World War 'guest' players were common at clubs throughout Great Britain. Morton was particularly fortunate in this respect in that two of English football's greatest ever players turned out at Cappielow. Sir Stanley Matthews and Tommy Lawton made several guest appearances for Morton. When Morton reached the 1948 Scottish Cup Final both players sent telegrams wishing good luck to their former club. Matthews simply said 'I am delighted to see Morton reach the final of the Scottish Cup'. Lawton's was more expressive, he said 'Memories of happy days during the war at Cappielow compel me to wish the Morton manager & the boys all the best of luck in their cup final at Hampden'.", "*  Tommy Lawton"]}, {"page": "Burnley F.C.", "response": ["Jimmy McIlroy is the most capped player while at the club, as he made 51 appearances for Northern Ireland between 1951 and 1962.Simpson (2007), pp. 532\u2013538 The first Burnley player to play in a full international match was John Yates, who took to the field for England against Ireland in March 1889. He scored a hat-trick but was never called up again.Simpson (2007), p. 13 In January 1957, 17-year-old Ian Lawson netted a record four goals on his debut against Chesterfield in the FA Cup third round. The youngest player to play for the club is Tommy Lawton, who was aged 16 years and 174 days on his debut against Doncaster Rovers in the Second Division on 28 March 1936.Simpson (2007), p. 210 His debut made him the then youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. The oldest player is Len Smelt, who played his last match aged 41 years and 132 days against Arsenal in the First Division on 18 April 1925."]}]}}
