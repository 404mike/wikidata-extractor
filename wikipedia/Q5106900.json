After five minutes, Watford took the lead when Michel Ngonge headed Peter Kennedy's cross into the bottom corner of the Birmingham City goal to make it 1\u20130.   Before half-time, Birmingham City's Chris Holland hit the outside of the post with a long-distance strike and Nick Wright's lob for Watford hit the crossbar.  Midway through the second half, Tommy Mooney's header hit the Watford bar before Paul Robinson was sent off for receiving a second yellow card for a foul on Peter Ndlovu.  No further goals were scored and the match ended 1\u20130 to Watford.  The return match was played at St Andrew's in Birmingham four days later.  Dele Adebola opened the scoring for Birmingham City after two minutes but David Holdsworth was sent off with more than an hour of the match remaining for a second yellow card. The first half ended 1\u20130, 1\u20131 on aggregate, and remained unchanged by the end of regular time.  Half an hour of extra time went goalless forcing the match to be decided by a penalty shootout.
