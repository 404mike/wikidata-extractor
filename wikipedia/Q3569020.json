The description was published in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (gregsonii) honours Edward Jesse Gregson who collected the type specimen \"on a wet ledge in the face of a perpendicular cliff overlooking a permanent creek in a gully at the base of Green Mountain, a little on the Bell side of Mount Wilson.\" In 1960, Mary Tindale elevated the variety to the species Blechnum gregsonii. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), this species is placed in the genus Parablechnum."]}]}}
