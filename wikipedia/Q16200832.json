However, after talks with Manager David Flitcroft, he ultimately stayed at the club throughout the summer transfer window. He continued to remain the club's first choice goalkeeper at the start of the 2017\u201318 season. Despite his Achilles injury shortly after, Vigouroux was praised for his performance in contributions to the club's best start to the season. However, he was soon involved in an incident with the match officials and was sent\u2013off shortly after the end of the match, in a 2\u20131 loss against Coventry City on 26 September 2017. As a result, he served a four match\u2013ban, which Manager Flitcroft criticised his action as \"unacceptable\". After serving his suspension, he found himself in a new competition over the first choice goalkeeper against Reice Charles-Cook. As a result, Vigouroux struggled to regain his place, as he was placed on the substitute bench and his own injury concern. It wasn't until on 2 December 2017 when he returned to the starting line\u2013up, conceding five goals, in a 5\u20132 against Stevenage in the second\u2013round of the FA Cup. Following this, Vigouroux was featured for the next four matches before being dropped again for poor performances. It was revealed that Vigouroux was dropped from the squad for poor disciplinary issues. Because of this, he wanted to leave the club. Shortly after the end of the 2017\u201318 season, where he made 17 appearances in all competitions, Manager Phil Brown hinted that Vigouroux may have a future at the club. After a strong start to the season at Swindon Town, he got called up for Chile national football team at the start of September. He didn't play for Chile during that call-up and was an unused sub despite doing well in training sessions. When he returned to Swindon fellow goalkeeper Luke McCormick had been performing so well in Vigoroux's absence that there was no need to drop McCormick. Vigoroux made his next appearance for Swindon over a month later in a League game against Mansfield Town who were coached by fellow manager and enemy David Flitcroft.
