Following the war he joined the part-time reserve Territorial Army, returning to the RFA, which became part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery (RA) in 1924. He was promoted to the rank of major later in 1924. He retired from the TA in 1930.With the outbreak of the Second World War Cundiff received a commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve.In June 1944, Edmund Ashworth Radford, the member of parliament for Manchester Rusholme, died. Cundiff was selected to contest the resulting byelection for the Conservative Party. Under a wartime political pact, the parties forming the coalition government agreed not to contest vacancies although he was opposed by a Common Wealth Party and an independent candidate. The poll was held on 8 July, and Cundiff was elected with a majority of 1,760 votes over the Common Wealth candidate. He was to remain as Rusholme's member of parliament for less than a year, as he was defeated by Lester Hutchinson of the Labour Party when a general election was held in 1945 by a margin of 11 votes.The Representation of the People Act 1948 reorganised constituencies throughout Great Britain, and Cundiff was chosen by the Conservatives to contest the Manchester Withington Borough Constituency which was formed from parts of the previous Rusholme and Withington seats. The new constituency was first contested at the 1950 general election, and he won the seat comfortably with a majority of over 8,500 votes over his Labour challenger. When a further general election was called in the following year, Cundiff chose to retire from the Commons.After parliament Cundiff took up another of directorships in companies including serving as chairman of Threlfalls Brewery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Frederick Cundiff"]}, {"page": "Manchester Withington (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Frederick Cundiff"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|Frederick Cundiff"]}, {"page": "Manchester Rusholme (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Frederick Cundiff"]}, {"page": "Lester Hutchinson", "response": ["The Scottish journalist Bob Brown (1924\u20132009) campaigned for Hutchinson in Manchester Rusholme in the 1945 general election, as a soldier stationed in Manchester.

Hutchinson was elected for the seat, defeating the sitting Conservative Frederick Cundiff by 15,408 votes to 15,398. In 1946 he made a maiden speech in the House of Commons, including regretting \"the traditional policy of bolstering up reactionary monarchs and decaying regimes wherever we can find them\" and the impact it had had on diplomatic relations with the USSR. In March 1946 he spoke at a public meeting on behalf of anti-Franco Spanish prisoners, from camps in France, being held in the UK, along with George Orwell, Fenner Brockway and Elizabeth Braddock."]}, {"page": "Frederick William Cundiff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Cundiff"]}, {"page": "Cundiff", "response": ["*Frederick Cundiff"]}, {"page": "1944 Manchester Rusholme by-election", "response": ["The Manchester Rusholme by-election of 1944 was held on 8 July 1944.
