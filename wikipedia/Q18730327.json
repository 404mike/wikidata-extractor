He gave her free rein with spending to improve the property, and her vision was to transform the house into a celebration of his genius. There they lived together openly, with Sir William and Emma's mother, in a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois that fascinated the public. Emma turned herself to winning over Nelson's family, nursing his 80-year-old father Edmund for 10 days at Merton, who loved her and thought of moving in with them, but could not bear to leave his beloved Norfolk. Emma also made herself useful to Nelson's sisters Kitty (Catherine), married to George Matcham, and Susanna, married to Thomas Bolton, by helping to raise their children and to make ends meet. Nelson's sister-in-law Sarah (married to William), also pressed him for assistance and favours, including the payment of their son Horatio's school fees at Eton. Also around this time, Emma finally told Nelson about her daughter Emma Carew, now known as Emma Hartley, and found that she had had nothing to worry about; he invited her to stay at Merton and soon grew fond of \"Emma's relative\". An unpublished letter shows that Nelson assumed responsibility for upkeep of young Emma at this time."]}, {"page": "Plymouth Breakwater", "response": ["In 1806, as the Napoleonic Wars impended, Lord St. Vincent commissioned John Rennie and Joseph Whidbey to plan a means of making Plymouth Bay a safe anchorage for the Channel Fleet. These plans may have been taken from ones made by George Matcham (1753 \u2013 3 February 1833). In 1811 came the order to begin construction; Whidbey was appointed Acting Superintending Engineer. This task required great engineering, organizational and political skills, as the many strictly technical challenges were complicated by the significant resources devoted to the project, from which various parties evidenced a desire for advantage. Nearly 4,000,000 (four million) tons of stone were quarried and transported, using about a dozen ships innovatively designed by the two engineers. A paper to the Royal Society suggests that Whidbey found many fossils as a result of the quarrying necessary to the breakwater."]}, {"page": "Matcham", "response": ["*George Matcham (1753\u20131833), British civil servant in India, and traveller"]}, {"page": "Horatia Nelson", "response": ["Though Horatia soon learnt of her real father, she never publicly acknowledged that Emma was her mother, perhaps partly due to Emma's continued insistence after Nelson's death that she was not her mother but her guardian. Before debt set in after Nelson's death, Emma introduced Horatia to high society. Emma died just before Horatia's fourteenth birthday at Calais in January 1815, having fled there with Horatia to escape debt. Returning to Dover, she was met by one of Nelson's brothers-in-law, George Matcham, and thereafter spent two years with the Matchams in Sussex, helping to look after the younger children. She then lived with another brother-in-law, Thomas Bolton, as his housekeeper, after Nelson's sister Susanna Bolton died, until she married."]}, {"page": "Edmund Nelson (priest)", "response": ["*Catherine Nelson (1767-1842), who married George Matcham and had numerous issue; she was buried at Slaugham in Sussex."]}, {"page": "James Capper", "response": ["*Observations on the Passage to India through Egypt; also to Vienna through Constantinople and Aleppo, and from thence to Bagdad, and across the Great Desert to Bassora, with occasional Remarks on the adjacent Countries, and also Sketches of the different Routes, London, 1784 and 1785.
