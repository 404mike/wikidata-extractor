He was a good all rounder who bowled fast and was a powerful hitter.\nHe played for a left-handed team in 1790 but S&B says he was right-handed.  He did not play during the years 1777 to 1781 inclusive, possibly because he was in the armed forces or otherwise employed away from Kent.  According to S&B, he was a farmer at Cudham.\nWilliam Brazier made 53 known first-class appearances from 1774 to 1794 but he continued to play village cricket until 1819 when he would have been 64 years old.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Nyren", "response": ["Nyren was left-handed as both batsman and bowler.Nyren, p. 56.

Lumpy Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey was, as Haygarth says, a \"given man\" on the Hambledon/Hampshire side but, in addition, the team included Earl of Winchilsea (White Conduit Club), Edward Hussey (Kent) and William Fennex (Middlesex). The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex. The other nine were usually associated with Kent: Stephen Amherst, James Aylward (though he played for Hampshire until 1779), Francis Booker, John Boorman, William Bowra, William Brazier, William Bullen, Robert Clifford and Henry Crozoer."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|William Brazier", "|William Brazier, CricketArchive.
