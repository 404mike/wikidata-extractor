He was a good all rounder who bowled fast and was a powerful hitter.\nHe played for a left-handed team in 1790 but S&B says he was right-handed.  He did not play during the years 1777 to 1781 inclusive, possibly because he was in the armed forces or otherwise employed away from Kent.  According to S&B, he was a farmer at Cudham.\nWilliam Brazier made 53 known first-class appearances from 1774 to 1794 but he continued to play village cricket until 1819 when he would have been 64 years old.", "link_mentions": {}}}
