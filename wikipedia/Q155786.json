Hungary has been the home of some of the most prominent researchers in various scientific disciplines, notably physics, mathematics, chemistry and engineering. As of 2018, twelve Hungarian scientists have been recipients of a Nobel Prize. Until 2012 three individuals: Csoma, J\u00e1nos Bolyai and Tihanyi were included in the UNESCO Memory of the world register as well as the collective contributions: Tabula Hungariae and Bibliotheca Corviniana. Contemporary, internationally well-known Hungarian scientists include mathematician L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz, physicist Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, physicist Ferenc Krausz, and biochemist \u00c1rp\u00e1d Pusztai. Hungary is famous for its excellent mathematics education which has trained numerous outstanding scientists. Famous Hungarian mathematicians include father Farkas Bolyai and son J\u00e1nos Bolyai, who was one of the founders of non-Euclidean geometry; Paul Erd\u0151s, famed for publishing in over forty languages and whose Erd\u0151s numbers are still tracked, and John von Neumann, a key contributor in the fields of quantum mechanics and game theory, a pioneer of digital computing, and the chief mathematician in the Manhattan Project. Notable Hungarian inventions include the lead dioxide match (J\u00e1nos Irinyi), a type of carburetor (Don\u00e1t B\u00e1nki, J\u00e1nos Csonka), the electric (AC) train engine and generator (K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3), holography (Dennis Gabor), the Kalman filter (Rudolf E.
