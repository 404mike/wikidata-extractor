The comments were immediately condemned as \"deflecting blame onto cyclists [and] grossly insensitive\" by Roger Geffen, campaigns and policy director of the Cyclists' Touring Club, and as \"dodging responsibility\" and \"an insult to the dead and injured\" by Darren Johnson, the Green Party member of the London Assembly. Former Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman, policy director for British Cycling, the national governing body for cycle racing in Great Britain, called on Johnson to ban HGVs from some London roads during peak hours, saying that Johnson had made a verbal promise to him \"to look at the successful experiences of Paris and many other cities in restricting the movements of heavy vehicles during peak hours\". Johnson stated in a radio interview that he was unconvinced by the idea, but was however considering banning cyclists from wearing headphones while riding. However, the traffic division of the Metropolitan Police were unable to identify any serious cycling incidents in which headphone use could be identified as a contributing factor."]}, {"page": "2008 Green Party of England and Wales leadership election", "response": ["In November 2007, the party held an internal referendum on whether they should replace the system of principal speakers with a single leader.
