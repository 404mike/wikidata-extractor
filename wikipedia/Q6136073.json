When the Labour Party split in 1931 over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate, William Mabane.\nHudson unsuccessfully contested the Altrincham by-election in 1933 (where all three candidates were former MPs), and at the 1935 general election he was defeated in Stockport.  After a 14-year absence, he was returned to the House of Commons at the 1945 general election as Labour Co-operative MP for the London constituency of Ealing West.\nThat seat was abolished in boundary changes for the 1950 general election, when he was elected for the new Ealing North seat, which he held until his defeat at the 1955 general election by the Conservative candidate, John Barter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Labour Co-operative MPs", "response": ["* James Hindle Hudson, Ealing West, 1945\u20131950; Ealing North, 1950\u20131955 (Previously Labour MP for Huddersfield, 1923\u201331)"]}]}}
