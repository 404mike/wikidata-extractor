This would seem in many case to be a misnomer as applied to the modem language of Kashghar\". Sven Hedin wrote, \"In these cases it would be particularly inappropriate to normalize to the East Turkish literary language, because by so doing one would obliterate traces of national elements which have no immediate connection with the Kaschgar Turks, but on the contrary are possibly derived from the ancient Uigurs\"."]}, {"page": "Yaqub Beg", "response": ["In 1867, Yakub rejected a Russian proposal for the construction of a road in his territory. Reinthal went to Kashgar with no effect. Yakub sent a man to Punjab and in response, in 1868, Robert Barkley Shaw went unofficially to Kashgar, the first Englishman to do so. He was soon joined by George W. Hayward. In 1870 Thomas Douglas Forsyth was sent to Kashgar as an envoy, finding Yakub campaigning in the east and returning to India. In 1871 Russia occupied Kulja. In 1872 Alexander Kaulbars went from Kulja to Kashgar and signed a trade treaty, but Yakub Beg was careful to ensure that Russian merchants made little profit. Kaulbars left with Haji Torah or Seyyid Yakub Khan, the nephew of Yakub Beg. Haji Torah went to Tashkent, St Petersburg and Constantinople, through the Suez Canal to India and returned with Forsyth. In 1874 Forsyth went to Kashgar and signed a trade treaty.

He was held in detention there for a time in a small fort made of sun-dried bricks on a shingly plain near the Karakash River which, at that time, was under the control of the Governor of Yarkand on behalf of the ruler of Kashgaria, Yaqub Beg. Shaw says there was no village at all: \"it is merely a camping-ground on the regular old route between Lad\u00e2k and Y\u00e2rkand, and the first place where I should strike that route. Four years ago [i.e. in 1864], while the troubles were still going on in Toorkist\u00e2n, the Maharaja of Cashmeer sent a few soldiers and workmen across the Karakoram ranges (his real boundary) and built a small fort at Shahidoolla.

Written sometime in the period from 1700 to 1849, the Eastern Turkic language (modern Uyghur)  Ta\u1e95kirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams provides an account of the Muslim Kara-Khanid war against the Khotanese Buddhists. The Ta\u1e95kirah uses the story of the Four Imams as a device to frame the chronicle, the Four Imams being a group of Islamic scholars from Mada'in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq), who travelled to help the Islamic conquest of Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar by the Kara-Khanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan. The legend of the conquest of Khotan is also given in the hagiology known as the Tazkirat or \"Chronicles of Boghra\". Extracts from the Tazkiratu'l-Bughra on the Muslim war against the  Khotan was translated by Robert Barkley Shaw."]}]}}
