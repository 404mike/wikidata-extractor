He became the youngest-ever player to appear for Dundee United when he made his first-team debut on 21 August 1990, though this record has since been broken by Greg Cameron. Playing as a striker and scoring in each of his first three games, Dailly quickly shot to prominence, making his Scotland Under 21 side debut just a month later. He won the Scottish Youth Cup with the club in 1990\u201391. In his debut season, Dailly managed five goals in eighteen appearances. His debut season would become his most prolific, and the 1991\u201392 season brought just eight games with no goals. In the 1992\u201393 season, Dailly scored four from fourteen appearances and firmly established himself as a regular in the 1993\u201394 season with 38 league appearances, and not only another four goals, but also the Scottish Cup, when his shot rebounded off the post for Craig Brewster to score the only goal against Rangers."]}, {"page": "2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship", "response": ["|CM||16|| Greg Cameron|||| "]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["April began in emphatic fashion, with a 4\u20132 win at Aberdeen which saw five goals in the opening seventeen minutes; Greg Cameron's first goals for United were enough to clinch victory. United entered the league split with an away match at Dunfermline and continued their winless streak that stretched back to 1997, losing 1\u20130. The following week, David Robertson's goal earned a 1\u20131 draw at home to Inverness, although it later transpired Jon Daly's knee injury was posterior cruciate ligament damage and would rule him out for several months. On the same day, United's proposed pre-season fixture with Barcelona was confirmed, before St Mirren eased their relegation worries with a 2\u20130 weekend win at Tannadice. The penultimate match of the season saw a third straight loss for United, going down 2\u20130 at Falkirk; earlier in the week, Derek Stillie confirmed he would leave the club at the end of the season to pursue an English law career. Collin Samuel was not far behind, although due to the club deciding not to offer a new contract. The Falkirk defeat also saw another d\u00e9but for a youngster with Johnny Russell making a late substitute appearance. The season finished with a 0\u20130 home draw against Motherwell.
