The new venture had a major impact on the Manchester Times; and in 1847 Prentice sold out his stake in the paper. In the following year the two publications became the Manchester Examiner and Times.

Betts, The Church of England, as I saw it, on Sunday, August 17th, 1862: including a conversation with a high-church clergyman on the bicentenary question, 1862, note p. 17. That year, an address of William McKerrow of the Presbyterian Church of England, on behalf of the Liberation Society, drew from him a rebuttal for the Manchester Church Defence Association. McKerrow supported voluntaryism, as a principle of education of religion; while Bardsley emphasised voluntary contributions to support evangelican causes they both valued, as common endeavour.Simon Gunn, The Ministry, the Middle Class and the \"Civilizing Mission\" in Manchester, 1850-80, Social History Vol. 21, No. 1 (Jan., 1996), pp. 22\u201336, at p. 31.", "*The \"Liberation Society\" and its Abettors (1861), against William McKerrow"]}]}}
