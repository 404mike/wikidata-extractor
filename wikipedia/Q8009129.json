In 1951, he became a justice of the peace.Fitzsimmons was also an active member of the Ulster Unionist Party and was the President of Duncairn Unionist Association. He was elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland at a by-election in 1956, representing Belfast Duncairn. In 1961, he was made Assistant Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, an assistant whip position. He also became Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce. He was then rotated through a series of Parliamentary Secretary positions, serving with the Ministry of Home Affairs from 1963 to 1964, the Ministry of Health and Local Government from 1964 to 1966 and also the Ministry of Development for a period in 1965.In April 1965, Fitzsimmons was finally appointed to a Cabinet position, becoming Minister of Education. He moved to become Minister of Development in 1966, back to Education in 1968 and finally served as Minister of Health and Social Services from 1969 until the Parliament was prorogued in 1972.In 1968, Fitzsimmons' daughter married a Roman Catholic. As a result, he resigned from the Orange Order.  At the 1969, former independent Unionist Member of Parliament Norman Porter stood against Fitzsimmons as a candidate whose opposition to Catholicism was in no doubt, but Fitzsimmons held his seat.At the Darlington Conference of 1973, Fitzsimmons served on the small Unionist team. Later in the year, he decided not to stand in the Northern Ireland Assembly election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Privy Counsellors of Northern Ireland", "response": ["| William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "William Fitzsimmons", "response": ["William Fitzsimmons may refer to:", "*William Fitzsimmons (Canadian politician) (1818\u20131894)", "*William Fitzsimmons (Northern Ireland politician) (1909\u20131992), in Northern Ireland", "*William Fitzsimmons (musician) (born 1978), American singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "List of Northern Ireland Parliament by-elections", "response": ["|William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "O'Neill ministry", "response": ["| William Fitzsimmons", "| William Fitzsimmons", "| William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "Chichester-Clark ministry", "response": ["| William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "Minister of Finance (Northern Ireland)", "response": ["*1961 \u2013 1963 William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "Minister of Education (Northern Ireland)", "response": ["| William Fitzsimmons", "| William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "Minister of Health and Local Government", "response": ["| William Fitzsimmons", "*1964 - 1965 William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "Minister of Development (Northern Ireland)", "response": ["| William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "Faulkner ministry", "response": ["| William Fitzsimmons"]}, {"page": "William Kennedy Fitzsimmons", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Fitzsimmons (Northern Ireland politician)"]}, {"page": "William Fitzsimmons (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Fitzsimmons (Northern Ireland politician)"]}, {"page": "Ulster Unionist Chief Whip", "response": [":1961: William Fitzsimmons"]}]}}
