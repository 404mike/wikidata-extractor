He transformed the fortunes of the publishing house Cassell & Co, and later became its proprietor. As an author, he published studies of the composers George Frideric Handel, Franz Schubert and (as co-author) Arthur Sullivan. He also edited the million-word journals of Arnold Bennett for publication.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arnold Bennett", "response": ["Inspired by those of the Goncourt brothers, Bennett kept a journal throughout his adult life.

According to Hugh Walpole, the editor, Newman Flower, \"was so appalled by much of what he found in the journals that he published only brief extracts, and those the safest\".Lyttelton and Hart-Davis, p. 176 Whatever Flower censored, the extracts he selected were not always \"the safest\": he let some defamatory remarks through, and in 1935 he, the publishers and printers had to pay an undisclosed sum to the plaintiff in one libel suit and \u00a32,500 in another.\"Journals of Arnold Bennett: Libel Action Settled\" The Times, 18 April 1935, p. 4; and \"High Court of Justice\", The Times, 23 November 1935, p. 4"]}, {"page": "A History of the English-Speaking Peoples", "response": ["At the independent suggestions of British publisher Newman FlowerThe Times obituary of Newman Flower, 13 March 1964, p. 19. and American editor Max Perkins,A.

Work was interrupted in 1939 when the Second World War broke out and Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty and became Prime Minister a year later. After the war ended in 1945, Churchill was busy, first writing his history of that conflict and then as Prime Minister again between 1951 and 1955, so it was not until the mid-1950s, when Churchill was in his early eighties, that he was able to finish his work ."]}, {"page": "The Woodlanders", "response": ["The novel remained a personal favourite of Hardy's.

In 1927, Herbert Sullivan and Newman Flower wrote, \"The Zoo was a trifle composed by Sullivan in 1875. ... It was never printed, and much of the music was used up again by the composer in his later Savoy operas.\"Sullivan and Flower, p. 79  This statement turned out to be one of many misleading statements in Sullivan and Flower's book when the score of The Zoo was rediscovered.  No re-use of music from The Zoo has been identified.See DeOrsey, Stan. \"Gilbert & Sullivan: Of Ballads, Songs and Snatches Lost or seldom recorded \u2013 Trial by Jury, A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 2003, accessed 4 November 2009.  DeOrsey suggests that several measures at the beginning of the song \"I loved her fondly\" were adapted as the first measures of \"A wand'ring minstrel, I\" in The Mikado. Hughes, p. 17, says merely that it \"foreshadows\" \"A wand'ring minstrel, I\".

F. Handel had just left his native land of Germany to London, accepting his new position at the Royal Academy of Music. Before that, Handel had already moved to England in 1712, spending his time based at the Burlington House before becoming house composer at Cannons in Middlesex.Newman Flower, George Frideric Handel: His Personality & His Times, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1948 It has been suggested that the move to Cannons was related to the fact that in 1717 there was reduced demand for his services in central London because operatic productions were experiencing a temporary downturn. At the end of Handel's stay at Cannons, the Duke and his friends helped him establish a new opera company in London, the so-called Royal Academy of Music."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sullivan", "response": ["In 1927 Sullivan collaborated with Newman Flower on a biography of Arthur Sullivan. As Sullivan and Flower had exclusive access to the composer's diaries, the biography was regarded at the time as uniquely authoritative. Subsequently, when wider access to the diaries became possible, it was seen that Sullivan had suppressed mention of his uncle's gambling and womanising, and this evasion, combined with the lack of musical analysis in the biography, led to a lowering of its status among scholars."]}, {"page": "Cassell's Magazine", "response": ["The magazine was edited by H.

Another long-running series was Travellers' Tales, \"Adventures and misadventures, songs and stories from lands overseas, told by world-wide travellers\". After the war the Scrapbook series continued, and in 1947 \"Gilbert and Sullivan\" was first broadcast. It was billed as \"a radio biography in six parts\", and featured Carleton Hobbs as narrator, with D. A. Clarke-Smith as W. S. Gilbert and Ivan Samson as Arthur Sullivan; the music was performed by singers including Gwen Catley, Sylvia Cecil, Mary Jarred, Winifred Lawson, Charles Heslop and Richard Lewis, conducted by Stanford Robinson. In preparing the script Baily had many conversations with people who had known Gilbert and Sullivan, including Nancy McIntosh, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, and Newman Flower.\"Gilbert and Sullivan\", Radio Times, 19 September 1947, pp. 3 and 6 The series was remade in 1949, with Charles Groves succeeding Robinson as conductor.
