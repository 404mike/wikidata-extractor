She was the last woman to be hanged in the United Kingdom after being convicted of the murder of her lover, David Blakely.\nDuring her childhood, Ellis' family moved from Rhyl to Basingstoke, Hampshire, and, in 1941, to Hampstead in London. In her teens she entered the world of London nightclub hostessing, which led to a chaotic life that included various relationships with men. One of these was with David Blakely, a racing driver engaged to another woman.\nOn Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955, Ellis shot Blakely dead outside the Magdala public house in Hampstead and she was immediately arrested by an off-duty policeman. At her trial in June 1955, she was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. On 13 July, she was hanged at HMP Holloway.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
