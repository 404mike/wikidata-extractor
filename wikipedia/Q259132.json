Burton's education at Oxford was unusually lengthy, possibly drawn out by an affliction of melancholy, and including an early transfer to Christ Church. Burton received an MA and BD, and by 1607 was qualified as a tutor. From as early as 1603, Burton indulged early literary interests at Oxford, including some Latin poems, a now-lost play performed before and panned by King James I himself, and his only surviving play: an academic satire called Philosophaster. This work, though less well regarded than Burton's masterpiece, has notably \"received more attention than most of the other surviving examples of university drama\".Sometime after obtaining his MA in 1605, Burton was making some attempt to leave the university. Though he never fully succeeded, he managed to obtain the living of St Thomas the Martyr's Church, Oxford through the university, and external patronage for the benefice of Walesby and the rectorship of Seagrave. As a fellow of Oxford, he served in many minor administrative roles and as the librarian of Christ Church Library, from 1624 until his death. Over time he came to accept his \"sequestered\" existence in the libraries of Oxford, speaking highly of his alma mater throughout the Anatomy.\nBurton's most famous work and greatest achievement was The Anatomy of Melancholy. First published in 1621, it was reprinted with additions from Burton no fewer than five times. A digressive and labyrinthine work, Burton wrote as much to alleviate his own melancholy as to help others. The final edition came to more than 500,000 words total. The book is permeated by quotations from and paraphrases of many authorities, both classical and contemporary, amounting to the culmination of a lifetime's worth of erudition.\nBurton died in 1640. His large personal library was split between the Bodleian and Christ Church. The Anatomy was used and plagiarised by many authors during his lifetime and after his death, but entered a lull in popularity through the 18th century. It was only the revelation of Laurence Sterne's plagiarism that revived interest in his work into the 19th century, especially among the Romantics. The Anatomy received more academic attention in the 20th and 21st centuries. Whatever his popularity, Burton has always attracted distinguished readers, including Samuel Johnson, Benjamin Franklin, John Keats, William Osler, and Samuel Beckett.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Moby-Dick", "response": ["Melville also borrowed stylistic qualities from Renaissance Humanists such as Thomas Browne and Robert Burton. Melville's biographer Hershel Parker notes that during the composition of Moby-Dick, Melville read Thomas Browne, Robert Burton, and Rabelais and adopted not only their poetic and conversational prose styles, but also their skeptical attitudes towards religion. Browne's statement \"I love to lose my selfe in a mystery to pursue my reason to an ob altitudo\" mirrors both in ethos and poetics Ishmael's \"I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it.\" ", "Scholars have also noted similarities between Melville's style and that of Robert Burton in his Anatomy of Melancholy. Scholar William Engel notes that \"Because Melville had Robert Burton\u2019s Anatomy of Melancholy at his side, this encyclopedic work will serve as a conceptual touchstone for analyzing his looking back to an earlier aesthetic practice.\" ", "Additionally, Melville's biographer Hershel Parker writes that \"in 1847, Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy served as Melville's sonorous textbook on morbid psychology\" and then \"in 1848 [Melville] bought Michel de Montaigne's works, where he read the Essays, finding there a worldly wise skepticism that braced him against the superficial pieties demanded by his time.\" Finally, Melville then read Thomas Browne's Religio Medici which Melville adored, describing Browne to a friend as \"a kind of 'crack'd archangel.'\""]}, {"page": "The Anatomy of Melancholy", "response": ["The Anatomy of Melancholy (full title: The Anatomy of Melancholy, What it is: With all the Kinds, Causes, Symptomes, Prognostickes, and Several Cures of it.

The phrase also appeared in Joseph Devlin's book How to Speak and Write Correctly (1910) to satirize speakers who chose their words to show superiority: \"For instance, you may not want to call a spade a spade. You may prefer to call it a spatulous device for abrading the surface of the soil. Better, however, to stick to the old familiar, simple name that your grandfather called it.\" Oscar Wilde uses the phrase in his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), when the character Lord Henry Wotton remarks: \"It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one.  It is the only thing he is fit for.\" Wilde uses it again in The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). Other authors who have used it in their works include Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Robert Browning, Jonathan Swift, and W.
