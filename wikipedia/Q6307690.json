The Blades also agreed a deal to take two young midfielders, John Fleck and Kyle Hutton, on loan from Rangers for the remainder of the season, but the deal subsequently fell through due to issues with the paperwork involved.  The team kicked off September by crushing Bury 4\u20130 at Bramall Lane, and then travelled to Scunthorpe United where they maintained their unbeaten start after coming from behind to grab a 1\u20131 draw.

Danny Wilson added to his defensive options by signing Marcus Williams on a months loan from Reading, with the defender making his d\u00e9but only hours later, although he was unable to prevent the Blades from crashing to their first league defeat of the season as they were trounced 3\u20130 at home by Huddersfield Town.  Despite this setback the Blades quickly returned to winning ways, reversing the previous scoreline to crush Colchester United 3\u20130 at Bramall Lane.

Off the field, the following week the club parted company with Chief Executive Julian Winter and Director of Academy Coaching John Pemberton, citing ongoing restructuring. With the red cards for both Doyle and Flynn being upheld on appeal, Danny Wilson bolstered the squad by bringing forward Paul Gallagher in on a months loan from Leicester City. Back on the pitch Gallagher, Kitson and Westlake all made their United debuts as the Blades were held to a 1\u20131 draw by Bury at Bramall Lane, whilst a 0\u20130 draw was the result when Doncaster Rovers visited Sheffield a couple of days later. A third goal of the season from Neill Collins was enough to continue the Blades' unbeaten start with a 1\u20130 victory over Yeovil Town at Huish Park. Despite the return of Michael Doyle and Ryan Flynn from suspension and a first goal from Dave Kitson, United were forced to settle for yet another 1\u20131 draw in their last game of September, versus Notts County at Bramall Lane."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["Sheffield United started the close season without a permanent manager, with caretaker manager Chris Morgan looking after the position whilst a fixed term manager was appointed.

The process to find a new manager proved to be a lengthy one with many managers and coaches being linked to the vacant position including interim manager Chris Morgan, Paul Dickov Rob Page, Gareth Southgate, Russell Slade, Michael Appleton, Kenny Jackett, and Keith Curle. Graham Arnold of Central Coast Mariners, Stuart McCall of Motherwell and Karl Robinson of MK Dons all rejected approaches from Sheffield United.

In their next match, United recorded a 1\u20130 home victory against Swindon Town with Jose Baxter scoring his second goal in as many games.
