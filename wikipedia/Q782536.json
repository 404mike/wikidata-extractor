The song itself evoked the Beatles' \"She's Leaving Home\" (1967), and leans into R&B. \"The Drowning Years\" tackles the topic of schizophrenia and contemplating suicide. \"Coming in from the Cold\" lacks the orchestration found on most of the tracks in lieu of straight-forward pop in the style of Coldplay and Travis. The almost seven-minute track \"Child Killers\" sees the music switch from a soft lullaby to funeral hymn to a symphony, and ending on trip hop.
