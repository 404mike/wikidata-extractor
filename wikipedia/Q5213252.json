He is a left-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Glamorgan and represented England up to under 17 level.\nCherry debuted for the Glamorgan 2nd XI in 1998 due to a spate of injuries to the Glamorgan team, and subsequently left to read history at Swansea University. He did not appear again until 2002, when he scored a one-day century against Scotland. He struggled to find a consistent place in the first XI in the County Championship and was usually overlooked for one day games, despite his century against Scotland\nHe was prolific for the 2nd XI in 2004 and fought his way back into the first team in the latter part of the season while a back injury to Matthew Elliott on the morning of Glamorgan's match against Surrey CCC in May 2005 led to his hasty inclusion. He retained his place in the side, scored his maiden first class fifty against Sussex and recorded both his maiden Championship hundred and double-hundred in the 1st innings of Glamorgan's match against Middlesex CCC at Southgate. His score of 226 is the 14th highest in the history of the club, and only eight batsmen have ever made larger scores.\nHe lost his first team place midway through the 2006 season before returning to the side towards the end of the season. He played in the early matches again in 2007, but failed to command a regular spot and was released from the county's staff to pursue a new career as a crime analyst.\nIn 40 first class matches he scored 1,824 runs with 3 centuries and a highest score of 226. His overall average was a disappointing 26.05 however and in 22 one day games he scored only 312 runs at 15.60 with a highest score of 42.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
