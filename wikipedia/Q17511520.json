As an infant, Eve was conceived while both of her parents were in wolf form and was therefore initially suspected to be the first werewolf to be born (rather than \"made\" via infection). Events in The Eve of the War, when she failed to transform at her first full moon, demonstrated that this was not the case and that she was apparently a normal human (albeit retaining some kind of supernatural ability as she is able to see Annie). However, at the same time Eve was identified (by the vampire Regus) as the prophesied \"War Child\" who would at some point in the future destroy the vampire race. With both of her parents dead, Eve's guardianship was taken over by Annie and her new companions Tom and Hal (with, for a while, some indirect backup from Regus). During the duration of Series 4, the baby Eve lived under the threat of extermination from both the Barry vampires and the vampire Old Ones en route from South America. She also appeared to be being stalked by the ghost of a young woman from the future."]}, {"page": "Annie Sawyer", "response": ["In the fourth series premiere \"Eve of the War\" (2012) Annie is worried by George's paranoia and despondency following Nina\u2019s murder. After sacrificing his life to save his daughter Eve \u2014 whom it is prophesied will save the world \u2014 he entrusts Annie and young werewolf Tom (Michael Socha) to look after her. Following on from this Annie and Tom receive a visit from the dying werewolf Leo (Louis Mahoney) and his housemates Pearl the ghost (Tamla Kari) and Hal the vampire (Damien Molony). After Annie helps Pearl admit her feelings for Leo the two depart for the afterlife together, leaving the vampire Hal dependent on Annie and Tom. From Pearl, Annie learns to \"swaddle\" baby Eve meaning both can leave the house undetected. When the sinister ghost Kirby (James Lance) is sent from the afterlife to kill the baby he splits the household up. Annie initially trusts his intent but he erodes her sense of purpose causing her to vanish. However Annie wills herself back and is able to kill Kirby's spirit by touch just as he has a knife over Eve's head. After helping new ghost Emrys (Anthony O'Donnell) pass on through his door after she accidentally killed him, Annie is contacted by the ghost of Eve's future self (Gina Bramhill) who asks Annie to accompany her into purgatory. Annie is shown a dystopian future where vampires rule supreme and humans and werewolves are rounded up in concentration camps and forced into dogfights. Eve reveals that in this alternate future Annie \"faded\" away after watching her remaining friends die. When Annie asks Eve what needs to be done to avert this future she is told that she needs to kill Eve as a baby. Annie at first resists this command, killing Nick Cutler (Andrew Gower) when he tried to kill Eve to bring down the vampires. However, after the vampire leader Mr Snow (Mark Gatiss) explains that Eve's survival will ensure that an effective resistance against the vampires will never form, Annie detonates a bomb killing Eve and the vampire Old Ones. Arriving in purgatory with baby Eve, Annie has a brief conversation with future Eve who fades away, the future having been averted. Annie enters another door where it is implied she will be reunited with George, Mitchell and Nina."]}, {"page": "List of Coronation Street characters (2012)", "response": ["| Gina Bramhill"]}, {"page": "Father Brown (2013 TV series)", "response": ["* Marianne Delacroix - Gina Bramhill (2016\u2013present).
