Christopher Longuet-Higgins, introducing the concept to the computer vision community. Richard Hartley and Andrew Zisserman's book reports that an analogous matrix appeared in photogrammetry long before that. Longuet-Higgins' paper includes an algorithm for estimating  \\mathbf{E}  from a set of corresponding normalized image coordinates as well as an algorithm for determining the relative position and orientation of the two cameras given that  \\mathbf{E}  is known. Finally, it shows how the 3D coordinates of the image points can be determined with the aid of the essential matrix."]}, {"page": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford", "response": ["*Andrew Zisserman, visionary pioneer in computer vision"]}, {"page": "USP College", "response": ["*Andrew Zisserman FRS"]}, {"page": "International Conference on Computer Vision", "response": ["| 2013 || Jitendra Malik, Andrew Zisserman"]}]}}
