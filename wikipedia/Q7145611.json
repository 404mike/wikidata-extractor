She is busily involved in village life and supports her children by taking on child-minding duties. Jill is an active member of the Women's Institute, opened up a holiday cottage business, and is teaching her grandson, Josh, how to keep bees. Jill has a less traditional outlook on life than her late husband, who had been a Justice of the Peace, reflected in her opposition to both fox hunting and private education. Following a burglary at Glebe Cottage she was asked by David and Ruth to return to Brookfield which subsequently became permanent. In 2019, she surprised her family by announcing that she had met a new man - Leonard Berry, a widower who she met while visiting the Laurels. Since then, Jill and Leonard have enjoyed a cosy companionship, complicated slightly when Leonard thought Jill wanted them to get married - when she made it clear that she had no desire to have another husband, they happily resumed their relationship.

In 1966, Jennifer abandoned plans to become a teacher and a writer and slept with the local cowman, Paddy Redman, which led to the birth of her son Adam, out of wedlock. Piper recalled the \"fabulous\" storyline enabled Jennifer to be the \"representative of a rebellious generation\". Shortly before Christmas Day in 1966, Jennifer tells her sister Lilian she is pregnant. At the time, Jennifer turns to Jill Archer (Patricia Greene), who urges her to come clean to her parents. Her grandmother, Doris Archer (Gwen Berryman) tells Jennifer she must immediately marry Paddy upon finding out, and her alcoholic father Jack threatens to throw her out of home. \"One of my press cuttings says: Jennifer expects \u2013 by kind permission of the Director General\u2019.,\" Piper recalled in a BBC interview. A banner was also held over Waterloo Bridge at the time with the line 'Doris Archer is a prude' scrawled on it. The shockwaves to the birth were so great on the show, the character departed temporarily, but returned - with baby in tow - to face the town. \"I got a letter written on lined notepaper from an elderly brother and sister living together in Plaistow (in London\u2019s East End),\" Piper recalled. \"They said they were very upset that I (Jennifer) might be thrown out of my home, Peggy being as she is, so they said they would take me in. I thought \u2018how sweet\u2019 and ignored it. But then I got another letter saying the brother had redecorated their front bedroom ready for me to come with the baby. And I thought \u2018ha ha\u2019 and ignored that one.  And then I got a third letter, some time later, saying \u2018my brother has been sitting at Paddington station waiting for the trains coming in from Hollerton Junction.\" In 2016, The Guardian journalist Susannah Clapp named the storyline of the \"10 best Archers storylines\", saying \"Jennifer once had the waywardness of her daughter Kate, and the romantic spirit of her youngest, Alice\".
