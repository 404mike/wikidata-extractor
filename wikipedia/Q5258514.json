In theory there was only one Skippy, but in reality there were many stand-ins. \"Like people, some kangaroos are brighter than others,\" said producer Dennis Hill. Nonetheless there are limits to what you can get a kangaroo to do. Often the actors could be noticed patting the kangaroo to get her to move, or holding her to prevent her moving. Kangaroo paw bottle-openers, of a type that could be purchased at any souvenir shop, were utilised for close-up scenes of Skippy opening doors or picking up objects. There was also a stuffed kangaroo from a taxidermist used for scenes from behind, or when Skippy was required to jump into a confined space such as the helicopter."]}, {"page": "Before the Blackout", "response": ["# \"A Lotta Nerve\" (Allister, Dennis Hill) \u2013 2:42"]}, {"page": "Max Hamilton", "response": ["He went on to work as senior registrar to Dennis Hill at King's College Hospital (from where he submitted his MD thesis on the personalities of patients with dyspepsia) and then worked for two years at Tooting Bec Hospital, in the diminished position of senior hospital medical officer.

The only first-team appearance Squires made for the club was on 13 March in a 2\u20130 defeat away to Brentford in the Second Division, again in the absence of Govan."]}]}}
