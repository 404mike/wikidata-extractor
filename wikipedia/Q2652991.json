The next year he returned to the Football League with Plymouth Argyle, before he was signed by Luton Town in December 1976, following loan spells with Oxford United and Ipswich Town. Three years later he moved on to Tottenham Hotspur, and played in the club's FA Cup victory in 1981. In 1982, he was loaned back to Luton Town, before he went back into non-league football with Barnet.

Cardiff were in the relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and challenging for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday held out a hand to apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4\u20132 and at the end of the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3\u20130 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury."]}, {"page": "Joe Jordan", "response": ["As the new Manchester United number 9, Jordan reached the 1979 FA Cup Final, ultimately losing 3\u20132 to the north London club Arsenal. During a 1980 FA Cup third round replay at Old Trafford, Jordan clashed with Tottenham goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, dislocating Alexsic's jaw. The Independent in 2011 described this as a revenge act for Aleksic having repeatedly been charging Jordan during corners. It became known as the game that saw Tottenham's best player Glenn Hoddle have to play in goal. He remained at Old Trafford until 1981, when he moved to Italy to Milan.", "Citing his dislocation of Milija Aleksic's jaw in 1980 as an example, The Independent described in 2011 how Jordan was a player who \"did not stand for nonsense on the pitch\".

As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston.
