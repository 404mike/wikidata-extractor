In 1779 the parish minister Edmund Jones described the area thus: \"The valley of Tyleri ... is the most delightful. The trees ... especially the beech trees, abounding about rivers great and small, the hedges and lanes make these places exceeding pleasant and the passing by them delightful and affecting ... in these warm valleys, with the prospect of the grand high mountains about them would make very delightful habitations.\" In 1799 clergyman and historian Archdeacon William Coxe toured the area and in writing a diary of his travels described it as \"... richly wooded, and highly cultivated...we looked down with delight upon numerous valleys ... with romantic scenery\". The entire population of Aberystruth parish at the turn of the 19th century was just a little over 800.

The earliest Alpine mountain climbers sometimes came upon whole villages affected by it.Fergus Fleming, Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps, 2000, Grove Press, p. 179 The prevalence of the condition was described from a medical perspective by several travellers and physicians in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.See, for example, William Coxe, \"Account of the Vallais, and of the Goiters and Idiots of that Country,\" Universal Magazine of Knowledge & Pleasure, vol. 67, Dec. 2, 1780.  At that time the cause was not known and it was often attributed to \"stagnant air\" in mountain valleys or \"bad water\". The proportion of people affected varied markedly throughout southern Europe and even within very small areas, it might be common in one valley and not another. The number of severely affected persons was always a minority, and most persons were only affected to the extent of having a goitre and some degree of reduced cognition and growth. The majority of such cases were still socially functional in their pastoral villages."]}, {"page": "Stonehenge", "response": ["William Cunnington was the next to tackle the area in the early nineteenth century.

Richard Colt Hoare supported Cunnington's work and excavated some 379 barrows on Salisbury Plain including on some 200 in the area around the Stones, some excavated in conjunction with William Coxe. To alert future diggers to their work they were careful to leave initialled metal tokens in each barrow they opened. Cunnington's finds are displayed at the Wiltshire Museum.

The development of industrial works and employment opportunities near the emerging town also precipitated the building of dwellings along the Afon Lwyd to provide housing for the workforce. Trade and commerce also developed and Pontypool, largely due to the endeavours of the Vaughan family, acquired a strong reputation for clock-making during the eighteenth century. By the middle of the eighteenth century, a small town had clearly developed, providing employment, housing and a commercial role, also serving as an important local centre for the surrounding hamlets.Lloyd (2009), pp.25\u201326 By the time Archdeacon William Coxe visited Pontypool at the dawn of the nineteenth century, the town had some 250 houses and a number of thriving shops and businesses, catering for a population of approximately 1,500 people.Cadw (2012), p.12"]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 18th century", "response": ["*William Coxe (1747\u20131828), historian"]}, {"page": "John Adolphus", "response": ["The success of his history and the influence of Archdeacon William Coxe brought Adolphus into close connection with Henry Addington, then prime minister.

It was traditionally thought to have been built in 1272, though this date has no supporting documentary evidence. The historian William Coxe incorrectly described the bridge as pre-dating the Norman Conquest and recorded that \"it commanded the passage of the Monnow and was a barrier against the Welsh\". In 1804, the Monmouth antiquarian Charles Heath wrote that the bridge's \"foundation is so ancient that neither history or tradition afford any light respecting the date of its erection\". Heath drew directly from The Antiquities of England and Wales, an earlier guide by Francis Grose, published in 1773. The archaeologist Martin Cook notes the significance of the date 1270 as the start of a period that saw increased bridge-building, as a result of the rapid growth of international trade. The civil engineer Edwyn Jervoise suggested that the absence of an evidential record was due to the destruction of the archives of the Duke of Beaufort at Raglan Castle in the 17th century. This is unlikely, as the gatehouse did not come into the possession of the duke's family, the Somersets, until the 19th century."]}, {"page": "Monmouth School for Boys", "response": ["Ward described the early 19th century period of the school's history as years of \"controversy\". These focused mainly on three issues; relations between the school and the town, relations between the school, the town and the Haberdashers Company and the Court of Chancery, which together were responsible for the school's funding and oversight, and attempts to expand the school's curriculum beyond the traditional study of Latin and Greek. The first issue saw the school perceived as part of the faction of the Dukes of Beaufort, the premier landowners in the county, and directors of the town's politics from their regional base at Troy House. Early 19th century Monmouth had a strong Radical tradition led by burgesses such as Thomas Thackwell, and fuelled by the liberal positions of the local newspapers, the Monmouthshire Beacon and the Monmouthshire Merlin. The school's leadership was perceived in the town to be too close to the Beauforts, and Thackwell ran an almost fifty-year campaign against their attempts to defend the established order. The second controversy related to the governance of the school and another long campaign of attrition saw the school's Lecturer lose the responsibility for preparing an annual report on the school, this being transferred by the Court of Chancery to a Board of Visitors. The last area of conflict arose between the school's leadership, which wanted to maintain the tradition of a curriculum that involved the study solely of Latin and Greek, and the Court and the Haberdashers who wanted expansion to cover such areas as writing and arithmetic. In a damming report in 1827 they condemned \"the present Masters, though so liberally paid, and having so little to do, consider themselves engaged only to teach Latin and Greek. A school teaching those branches of learning only will never be useful to a place of such confined population as Monmouth\". Reforms introduced by John Oakley Hill in 1852, saw the establishment of Upper and Lower Schools, the former continuing to provide a classical education, while the latter had a curriculum focused on writing and arithmetic. William Coxe, who undertook extensive tours of Wales in the very late 18th and early 19th centuries in the company of his friend, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, recorded his impressions of the school in the second volume of his An Historical tour in Monmouthshire, published in 1801. Describing the school as enjoying \"a high reputation under the care of (the headmaster) the Rev. John Powell\", Coxe retells the mythical story of the school's establishment and records a \"portrait of the founder, habited in the costume of the age of James the First, with an inscription 'Walter William Jones, haberdasher and merchant of London etc.' is preserved in the school room\"."]}, {"page": "Zen\u00f3n de Somodevilla, 1st Marquess of Ensenada", "response": ["Little is known of Somodevilla's parents, Francisco de Somodevilla and his wife, Francisca de Bengoechea, nor is anything known of his own life prior to entering the civil administration of the Spanish navy as a clerk in 1720.

This story originated in a deposition given by Giles Gilbert of Shirenewton during the course of a 1720s legal case regarding rights to operate the ferry, and which was later printed by William Coxe in his 1801 Historical Tour of Monmouthshire.Morgan, Octavius (1860) Notes on the ancient domestic residences of Pentre-Bach, Crick, Ty-Mawr, the Garn, Crindau, and St. Julian's, v4, p.12 While Gilbert claimed to be \"credibly informed\" that a group of Parliamentarian soldiers had perished while pursuing the King, another witness in the same legal case gave evidence that the incident had in fact involved a group of twelve Royalists who \"in haste to pass\" in November 1644 had forced the boatmen to take them across at low tide.Morgan (1860) p.13 The antiquary Octavius Morgan, on investigating these stories, found that the Iter Carolinum and the diary of Richard Symonds proved that Charles had intended to use the Black Rock crossing to reach Bristol on 24 July 1645, but had been dissuaded. Morgan however noted a contemporary report that Charles had a \"narrow escape of being taken near the Black Rock\" in July 1645 and suggested that some of Charles's party had crossed the Passage on the evening of 24 July \"probably sent purposely to mislead the enemy [...] and the result was death by drowning of the pursuers\".Morgan (1860) p.13"]}, {"page": "The Historians' History of the World", "response": ["Part XVIII: The History of the Germanic Empires states that the work was based chiefly upon the following authorities: Aeneas Silvius, Alfred von Arneth, A.
