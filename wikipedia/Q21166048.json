Nooth earned his medical degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1766 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1774. In the same year, inspired by Joseph Priestley's work on \"fixed air\" (now known as carbon dioxide), Nooth invented an instrument for producing carbonated water. The Nooth apparatus, as it came to be called, became popular for household use; the liquid it produced was thought to have medicinal properties. Modified versions of the Nooth apparatus were used in commercial beverage manufacturing and in early experiments with general anaesthesia. Nooth joined the British Army in 1775 and served in North America until 1784, becoming superintendent-general of the British military hospitals in 1779. In 1788 he was deployed to Quebec; he remained in Canada until 1799 and became involved in scientific and political pursuits there. On his return he settled in Bath, England, where he lived until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Soft drink", "response": ["Another Englishman, John Mervin Nooth, improved Priestley's design and sold his apparatus for commercial use in pharmacies. Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman invented a generating apparatus that made carbonated water from chalk by the use of sulfuric acid. Bergman's apparatus allowed imitation mineral water to be produced in large amounts. Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius started to add flavors (spices, juices, and wine) to carbonated water in the late eighteenth century. Thomas Henry, an apothecary from Manchester, was the first to sell artificial mineral water to the general public for medicinal purposes, beginning in the 1770s. His recipe for 'Bewley's Mephitic Julep' consisted of 3 drachms of fossil alkali to a quart of water, and the manufacture had to 'throw in streams of fixed air until all the alkaline taste is destroyed'."]}, {"page": "Soda fountain", "response": ["Early scientists tried to create effervescent waters with curative powers, including Robert Boyle, Friedrich Hoffmann, Jean Baptiste van Helmont, William Brownrigg, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, and David Macbride. In the early 1770s, Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman, and (separately) English scientist Joseph Priestley invented equipment for saturating water with carbon dioxide. In 1774, John Mervin Nooth demonstrated an apparatus that improved upon Priestley's design. In 1807, Henry Thompson received the first British patent for a method of impregnating water with carbon dioxide. This was commonly called soda water, although it contained no sodium bicarbonate."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| John Mervin Nooth||03/03/1774||?

On 17 December 1846, Boott received a letter from Jacob Bigelow detailing the Boston dentist William Thomas Green Morton's successful use of ether for general anaesthesia during an operation on a neck tumour. He resolved, with Robinson's help, to test this new technique. On the 19th of December, at Boott's home on 24 Gower Street, Robinson administered ether to a young woman undergoing a tooth extraction\u2014the first use of general anaesthesia in Britain. The gas was administered using a homemade inhaler based on a water carbonation device invented by John Mervin Nooth. Robinson gave several demonstrations of his technique; those in attendance included Robert Liston and John Snow, who went on to make further explorations of ether's anaesthetic properties."]}, {"page": "John Mervyn Nooth", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Mervin Nooth"]}, {"page": "Nooth apparatus", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Mervin Nooth#The Nooth apparatus"]}, {"page": "Nooth's apparatus", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Mervin Nooth"]}, {"page": "Nooth", "response": ["* John Mervin Nooth (1737\u20131828), English physician, scientist, and army officer"]}]}}
