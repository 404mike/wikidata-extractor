CAT was described by The Independent newspaper as \"the jewel in the crown of UK biotech.\" From 1990 to 2002, Chiswell was operationally responsible for running CAT. From 1996 until 2002, Chiswell was the company's CEO. After he left CAT he devoted himself to growing the British biosciences industry, serving as the chairman of the BioIndustry Association from 2003 to 2005.\nIn 2003, Chiswell became chairman of the BioIndustry Association, and in June 2006 was awarded an OBE for services to the UK Bioscience Industry in the UK and Overseas.

Sir Greg Winter received his award for the phage display of peptides and antibodies. Sir Greg and David Chiswell founded Cambridge Antibody Technology to exploit this science.
