After examining as many contemporary references as could be found, he concluded that stave dancing not only grew out of the social activities of the south-western friendly societies, but that it represented a distinct style of English folk-dance worthy of standing alongside other English dancing traditions; conclusive evidence of many of whose origins is equally obscure. Little in the way of reliable choreography or musical notation could be found and so, with the help of one or two morris dancing teams including Bath City Morris and Abercorn Morris, Dommett re-choreographed a number of dances: "]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2015", "response": ["*Roy Dommett, 82, British engineer and rocket scientist.Dommett \u2013 Deaths Announcements"]}, {"page": "Roy Leonard Dommett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roy Dommett"]}]}}
