While organist of St Luke's Church, Chelsea, a London church, he published (1843) National Psalmody, containing some original numbers. His opera The Fairy Oak was disliked by the critics, but had a run of a week or two after its production at Drury Lane, 18 October 1845. A cantata, Ruth, was performed in 1847.\nForbes frequently associated with his brother George Forbes (1813\u20131883) in concerts, and was between 1827 and 1850 conductor of the Societ\u00e0 Armonica. He died on 24 November 1859, in his fifty-sixth year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Forbes", "response": ["Henry Forbes may refer to:", "* Henry Forbes (composer) (1804\u20131859), pianist and composer"]}, {"page": "St Luke's Church, Chelsea", "response": ["The position of organist and choirmaster has been held by several notable musicians, often as a stepping-stone to cathedral positions.  Two organists were composers who also wrote the tunes for hymns: Sir John Goss who wrote Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven and the carol See, Amid the Winter Snow, and John Ireland.  Henry Forbes was another 19th-century composer who was organist. More recently Denis Vaughan and Jeremy Filsell have been Directors of Music."]}]}}
