The violins had been played by a Birmingham School of Music classical violin student named Helen Bevington. Rowland's first idea was to get the horn players to also play strings, as he had discussed in the March interview (with Speare on viola, which he already played, and string novices Paterson and Maurice on cello), and the horn players (with session musician support) contributed strings to the third single with the new lineup, \"Liars A to E\", produced by Neil Kernon, which was released in October 1981.  In November, the group played a three-night stand at The Old Vic in London, with the horn section again doubling on strings. The Old Vic shows attracted unexpectedly rave reviews in the press, although these concerts were not recorded. Rowland said of these shows, \"Those three nights at the Old Vic were all I wanted to say in '81.\""]}, {"page": "Hall & Oates", "response": ["The 1980s brought about significant changes for Hall and Oates. The pair felt that the biggest hindrance to their success was that their music was being filtered through outside producers, and that studio musicians were not familiar with their own tastes and thoughts. In 1979, they hired G. E. Smith (who had worked with Dan Hartman and David Bowie by then) as lead guitarist, Mikey Curry as drummer in 1980 and later in 1981 Tom \"T-Bone\" Wolk joined as bassist. They also enlisted Hall's girlfriend Sara Allen (and also her younger sister Janna) as songwriting collaborators, as well as beginning a working relationship with Neil Kernon, an engineer on Voices who worked as co-producer on their succeeding two albums. In late 1979, Hall and Oates released X-Static, which combined rock with disco. The album did not fare well, although \"Wait for Me\" did hit the top 20.
