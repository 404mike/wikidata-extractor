The Sea was in contention alongside novels written by Julian Barnes, Sebastian Barry, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ali Smith and Zadie Smith. The chairman of the judges was John Sutherland. Earlier that year Sutherland had written approvingly of Ian McEwan's novel Saturday. Banville, however, dismissed the work in The New York Review of Books and expressed his dismay that McEwan was increasingly showing \"a disturbing tendency toward mellowness\". Anne Haverty later described Banville's critique of Saturday as \"devastatingly effective\". Sutherland sent a letter (signed with the title \"Lord Northcliffe Professor Emeritus\") in response to Banville's review, a letter in which he took Banville to task over his misreading of a game of squash in the novel. Banville issued a written reply with the opening line: \"Summoned, one shuffles guiltily into the Department of Trivia\", before begging Sutherland's pardon for his \"sluggish comprehension\" after managing to make his way through \"all seventeen pages\" of the game. Banville later admitted that, upon reading Sutherland's letter, he had thought: \"[W]ell, I can kiss the Booker goodbye\".", "At the award ceremony, BBC Two's Kirsty Wark quizzed Financial Times arts editor Jan Dalley, the Independent on Sunday literary editor Suzi Feay and The Observer literary editor Robert McCrum. Banville, Barry and Ali Smith were dismissed outright and much of the discussion focused on Barnes, Ishiguro and Zadie Smith. In the end, the judges' vote was split between Banville and Ishiguro, with Rick Gekoski one of those favouring Banville. It fell to Sutherland to cast the winning vote; he did so in favour of Banville. Banville later said: \"I have not been the most popular person in London literary circles over the past half-year.
