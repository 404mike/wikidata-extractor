He next raced in 1955, driving a Jaguar C-type.\nAfter his motor racing career came to an end, Barber retired to live on a boat in the Mediterranean.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 22", "response": ["*1929 \u2013 John Barber, English racing driver (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "1953 Argentine Grand Prix", "response": ["The inaugural Argentine Grand Prix, held in mid-January, was attended by four of the major works teams: Maserati, Ferrari, Cooper, and Gordini.
