Historian Robert Malcolm Errington suggests that one of the earliest Argead kings established Aigai (modern Vergina) as their capital in the mid-7th centuryBC.. Before the 4th centuryBC, the kingdom covered a region corresponding roughly to the western and central parts of the region of Macedonia in modern Greece.. It gradually expanded into the region of Upper Macedonia, inhabited by the Greek Lyncestae and Elimiotae tribes, and into regions of Emathia, Eordaia, Bottiaea, Mygdonia, Crestonia, and Almopia, which were inhabited by various peoples such as Thracians and Phrygians., see also  for the Macedonian expulsion of original inhabitants such as the Phrygians. Macedonia's non-Greek neighbors included Thracians, inhabiting territories to the northeast, Illyrians to the northwest, and Paeonians to the north, while the lands of Thessaly to the south and Epirus to the west were inhabited by Greeks with similar cultures to that of the Macedonians.."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Robert Malcolm Errington (born 1939), Britain"]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Robert Malcolm Errington (born 1939)"]}, {"page": "Eurydice I of Macedon", "response": ["Among modern scholars and historians, Eugene N. Borza, A. B. Bosworth and Kate Mortensen support an Illyrian ancestry, while Robert Malcolm Errington, N. G. L. Hammond, and Charles F. Edson support a Lynkestian ancestry. In an inductive analysis of the historical information over Sirras, through an a posteriori argument, Elias Kapetanopoulos also says that Sirras must have been a Lynkestian \u2013 and thus Eurydice as well \u2013 though he has also hypothesized a Macedonian or Orestian origin. Ian Worthington also makes a case for her Lynkestian ancestry by stating the following argument concerning the Illyrian hypothesis: \"However, this is unlikely in light of a comment that Attalus made at the wedding of Philip in 337, intended as a slur on Alexander's legitimacy, for his mother (Olympias) was from Epirus. Attalus presumably would not have wanted to draw attention to Philip's illegitimacy if his mother were non-Macedonian\", and also writes that, \"Attalus' taunt, incidentally, goes some way to determining whether Philip's mother, Eurydice, was Lyncestian or Illyrian. If she had been the latter, then Attalus' remark would, by implication, make Philip also illegitimate. ... Hence Philip's mother was probably Lyncestian.\". Others also argue on her possible Lynkestian origin, stating that \"she may have been descended from a branch of the Bacchiadae clan, originally of Corinth\"."]}, {"page": "Ancient Macedonians", "response": ["Modern scholarly discourse has produced several hypotheses about the Macedonians' place within the Greek world. Considering material remains of Greek-style monuments, buildings, inscriptions dating from the 5th century and the predominance of Greek personal names, one school of thought says that the Macedonians were \"truly Greeks\" who had retained a more archaic lifestyle than those living in southern Greece. This cultural discrepancy was used during the political struggles in Athens and Macedonia in the 4th century. This has been the predominant viewpoint since the 20th century. Worthington wrote, \"...\u00a0not much need to be said about the Greekness of ancient Macedonia: it is undeniable\".. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337 BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected hegemon Philip II, despite him not being a member of the league itself).. Hatzopoulos stresses the fact that Macedonians and other peoples such as the Epirotes and Cypriots, despite speaking a Greek dialect, worshiping in Greek cults, engaging in panhellenic games, and upholding traditional Greek institutions, nevertheless occasionally had their territories excluded from contemporary geographic definitions of \"Hellas\" and were even considered non-Greek barbarians by some.; Johannes Engels comes to a similar conclusion about the comparison between Macedonians and Epirotes, saying that the \"Greekness\" of the Epirotes, despite them not being considered as refined as southern Greeks, never came into question. Engels suggests this perhaps because the Epirotes did not try to dominate the Greek world as Philip II of Macedon had done. See: . Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou,. Robert Malcolm Errington,. and Craige B. Champion.."]}, {"page": "Virius Nicomachus Flavianus", "response": ["* Robert Malcolm Errington: The Praetorian Prefectures of Virius Nicomachus Flavianus.
