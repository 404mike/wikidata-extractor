The 12\" single was backed with a primarily instrumental version of the song entitled \"The Beach\" on the B-side. The single's unique packaging was designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens. It features a die-cut sleeve designed to resemble a -inch floppy disk. The front cover features no words, but instead has code in the form of coloured blocks that reads out the artist, song, and label information, once deciphered.", "The single's original sleeve, created by Factory designer Peter Saville and Brett Wickens, was die-cut with a silver inner sleeve. It cost so much to produce that Factory Records actually lost money on each copy sold. Matthew Robertson's Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album notes that \"[d]ue to the use of die-cutting and specified colours, the production cost of this sleeve was so high that the single sold at a loss.\" Tony Wilson noted that it lost 5p per sleeve \"due to our strange accounting system\"; Saville noted that nobody expected \"Blue Monday\" to be a commercially successful record at all, so nobody expected the cost to be an issue.\" In Shadowplayers: The Rise and Fall of Factory Records, Saville states \"I am so bored with this story. We didn't even know how many of these expensive covers were ever made anyway.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Saville (graphic designer)", "response": ["In 1979, Saville moved from Manchester to London and became art director of the Virgin offshoot Dindisc. He subsequently created a body of work that furthered his refined take on modernism, producing work for artists such as Roxy Music, Wham!, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Ultravox and Peter Gabriel. During his time at Dindisc, he also designed the sleeve for Canadian band Martha and the Muffins\u2019 album Metro Music. He was paid more to design Gabriel's 1986 album So than for any other record sleeve in his career; he received \u00a320,000. Saville founded the design agency Peter Saville Associates (still designing primarily for musical artists and record labels), which included Brett Wickens, before he was invited to close his office in 1990 to join the partner-owned Pentagram. Saville collaborated with Transport for Greater Manchester in 2008 for the rebranding of the Metrolink tram system with a yellow and silver polka-dot scheme after a period of significant expansion had been undertaken on the network.", "In 1993 Saville left London and moved to Los Angeles, to join ad agency Frankfurt Balkind with Brett Wickens. Saville soon returned to London, however, where he asked designer Howard Wakefield to restart the design studio. For three years they worked from \"The Apartment\" in partnership with German advertising agency Meir\u00e9 & Meir\u00e9. Saville's modernist apartment in Mayfair doubled as the London studio. (The same apartment is depicted in the record sleeve of Pulp's album This Is Hardcore). The Apartment produced works for clients such as Mandarina Duck and Smart Car. In 1999 Saville moved to offices in Clerkenwell."]}, {"page": "So (album)", "response": ["So is Gabriel's first non-eponymous album. Gabriel has noted his dislike for titling albums, mainly because it distracts from the sleeve design. In an interview for Rolling Stone, he explained that his American label Geffen Records refused to release Peter Gabriel IV until it was retitled Security. He elaborated that for So \"[he] decided to go for the anti-title\u00a0... It can be more a piece of graphic, if you like, as opposed to something with meaning and intention. And that's what I've done ever since\". When the album was profiled in the Classic Albums documentary series, Gabriel quipped that its short title meant it could be enlarged and useful when marketing it. Before the album was eventually named So, it was meant to be entitled Good. The album's cover is a portrait of Gabriel photographed by Trevor Key, who was then most famous for capturing the bell artwork for Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (1973). The sleeve was designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens; Saville was best known for designing several sleeves for Factory Records artists and was paid \u00a320,000 for his work on So. Gabriel recalled: \"The only compromise I made was to go with Peter Saville's idea for a retro-style portrait. I was told my usual obscure LP sleeves alienated women.\" The cover was partly influenced by photographer David Bailey's work."]}, {"page": "Latent Recordings", "response": ["The label was formed in London by Michael Timmins, Alan Anton, Geoff Railton, and Brett Wickens to produce and distribute their music.
