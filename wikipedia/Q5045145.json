Prior to this she was editor of Antiquity and Keeper of the Department of Prehistory and Early Europe at the British Museum.  She began her career as curator at the Alexander Keillor Museum at Avebury.\nHer research interests include fieldwork in peninsular Italy (since 1983), Malta (since 1987), and Troina in Sicily (since 1997), and currently in Britain. Specific topics include archaeological theory and practice; Neolithic and Copper Age societies of Britain, Europe, Mediterranean, and Italy; island societies and island archaeology; landscape and settlement archaeology: cultural resource management: artefacts and technology: fieldwork and survey. Malone headed a successful European Research Council bid for an Advanced Research Project entitled FRAGSUS which commenced in 2013. This project collaborates with institutions in Malta and investigates the environmental impact of early colonists in Malta, and excavated at the Neolithic temple sites of Ggantija, Santa Verna, Kordin III and Skorba as well as Tac Cawla and the Bronze Age site of In Nuffara in an attempt to explored chronology, economy and landscape.\nMalone graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in archaeology and anthropology at the University of Cambridge in 1980 (promoted to MA (Cantab)), and was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in archaeology by Cambridge University in 1986. She is married to Cambridge archaeologist Simon Stoddart with whom she has directed fieldwork since 1983 and has two children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Malta", "response": ["A second wave of colonization arrived from Sicily in around 3850\u00a0BC.

As a result, he argued, archaeology had suffered a \"loss of innocence\" as archaeologists became sceptical of the work of their forebears.Clarke 1973. Clarke's paper would later be described as \"one of the seminal statements of the New Archaeology, by one of its leading proponents\" in Britain, if not elsewhere, by the archaeologists Caroline Malone and Simon Stoddart.Malone and Stoddart 1998. p. 676."]}, {"page": "O. G. S. Crawford", "response": ["Crawford was recognised for his contributions to bringing archaeology to a wide sector of the British public. The archaeologist Caroline Malone stated that many viewed Crawford as \"an 'amateur's' archaeologist, providing the means to publish and comment outside the restrictions of local journals and to offer a vision of a new and universal discipline\". Clark expressed the view that Crawford \"always hankered to restore the flesh and blood and to make the past a reality to the living generation\", and in doing so helped to attract a greater public audience for British archaeology than many of his colleagues. Wheeler remarked that \"he was our greatest archaeological publicist; he taught the world about scholarship, and scholars about one another\"."]}, {"page": "St Michael's Mount", "response": ["There is evidence of people living in the area during the Neolithic (from circa 4000 to 2500 BC years). The key discovery was of a leaf-shaped flint arrowhead, which was found within a shallow pit on the lower eastern slope, now part of the modern gardens. Other pieces of flint have been found, and at least two could be Mesolithic (circa 8000 to 3500 BC). During the Mesolithic, Britain was still attached to mainland Europe via Doggerland, and archaeologist and prehistorian Caroline Malone noted that during the Late Mesolithic the British Isles were something of a \"technological backwater\" in European terms, still living as a hunter-gatherer society whilst most of southern Europe had already taken up agriculture and sedentary living. At this time the mount would likely to have been an area of dry ground surrounded by a marshy forest. Any Neolithic or Mesolithic camps are likely to have been destroyed by the later extensive building operations, but it is reasonable to expect the mount to have supported either a seasonal or short-term camp for Mesolithic people."]}, {"page": "Henge", "response": ["Alasdair Whittle (2005) also views the development of the henge as a regional variation within a European tradition that included a variety of ditched enclosures. He notes that henges and the grooved ware pottery often found at them are two examples of the British Neolithic not found on the Continent. Caroline Malone (2001) also says that henges were not built in the rest of Western Europe, but they developed from a broader tradition of enclosure to become \"a phenomenon of the British Isles, a native tradition with sophisticated architecture and calendrical functions.\""]}, {"page": "Avebury", "response": ["The construction of large monuments such as those at Avebury indicates that a stable agrarian economy had developed in Britain by around 4000\u20133500\u00a0BC. The people who built them had to be secure enough to spend time on such non-essential activities. Avebury was one of a group of monumental sites that were established in this region during the Neolithic. Its monuments comprise the henge and associated long barrows, stone circles, avenues, and a causewayed enclosure. These monument types are not exclusive to the Avebury area. For example, Stonehenge features the same kinds of monuments, and in Dorset there is a henge on the edge of Dorchester and a causewayed enclosure at nearby Maiden Castle.Malone 1989 p.\u00a038. According to Caroline Malone, who worked for English Heritage as an inspector of monuments and was the curator of Avebury's Alexander Keiller Museum, it is possible that the monuments associated with Neolithic sites such as Avebury and Stonehenge constituted ritual or ceremonial centres.", "The top of the bank is irregular, something archaeologist Caroline Malone suggested was because of the irregular nature of the work undertaken by excavators working on the adjacent sectors of the ditch.Malone 1989. p. 107. Later archaeologists such as Aaron Watson, Mark Gillings and Joshua Pollard have, however, suggested that this was an original Neolithic feature of the henge's architecture.Watson 2001. p. 304.Gillings and Pollard 2004. p. 07."]}, {"page": "West Kennet Long Barrow", "response": ["In Britain, these tombs were typically sited on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories.
