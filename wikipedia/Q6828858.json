In North America, doctors identified a condition called the \"Space Invaders elbow\" as a complaint, while a physician in The New England Journal of Medicine named a similar ailment the \"Space Invaders Wrist\". Space Invaders was also the first game to attract political controversy when a 1981 Private Member's Bill known as the \"Control of Space Invaders (and other Electronic Games) Bill\", drafted by British Labour Member of Parliament (MP) George Foulkes, attempted to allow local councils to restrict the game and those like it by licensing for its \"addictive properties\" and for causing \"deviancy\". Conservative MP Michael Brown defended the game as \"innocent and harmless pleasure\", which he himself had enjoyed that day, and criticized the bill as an example of \"Socialist beliefs in restriction and control\". A motion to bring the bill before Parliament was defeated by 114 votes to 94 votes; the bill itself was never considered by Parliament. Similarly in the United States, in Westchester County, New York, there was a controversial political debate in 1981 over a resolution to place age restrictions on Space Invaders and other arcade games, following complaints that schoolchildren wasted time and lunch money, and went to school late; the resolution drew national attention."]}, {"page": "Neil Hamilton (politician)", "response": ["Hamilton also lent his support to the No Turning Back Group organised by his friend Michael Brown MP.

The product was believed to cause serious risk of oral cancer, particularly for minors, and the government was inclined to ban its import. Hamilton said he supported the introduction of Skoal Bandits on libertarian grounds, and lobbied ministers (including Edwina Currie and David Mellor) to allow its introduction. The House of Commons Select Committee on Standards investigation stated: \"Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Brown had a number of contacts with Ministers and officials as part of their campaign to influence Government policy on Skoal Bandits\" and said that there was \"no evidence ... that any appropriate declaration was made\". Hamilton was obliged to concede he had been wrong to make no reference to the payment \"when I went on those meetings with Ministers\".", "In June 1990, Hamilton was recruited by the right-wing Monday Club activist Derek Laud to work for Strategy Network International, a firm specifically created to lobby against anti-apartheid movements and economic sanctions and for apartheid South Africa's 'transitional government' of Namibia set up in defiance of UN Resolution 435 on Namibian independence.
