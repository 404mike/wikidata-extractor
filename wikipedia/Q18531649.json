William Gregson was employed continuously between 1826 and 1833 in this capacity and received annual payments. His employment ended in 1833 and two years later the Treasury agreed to find funds for a permanent Parliamentary Counsel, whose office had a salary fixed at \u00a31,200; this was incorporated into the Home Office in 1837. However the office was abolished in 1869 and its incumbent, Henry Thring, was appointed First Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury.J. C. Sainty, Office-Holders in Modern Britain: Volume 5, Home Office Officials 1782\u20131870 (University of London, 1975), pp. 11\u201344.Gregson's eventual replacement, but on a permanent and official footing, was John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune in 1835; he was succeeded in 1848 by Walter Coulson, and he in 1861 by Henry Thring. The counsel had a clerk after 1836, and there was also a Solicitor to the Home Office (William Vizard), appointed briefly between February and September 1841 and not replaced, the functions going to the Treasury Solicitor.
