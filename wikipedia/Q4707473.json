Given that she was on the West coast, and he was on the East, letters were their primary form of communication. Jones wondered what effect those letters would have on her young daughter. Simultaneously, Jones had become fixated on Alan Parker\u2019s 1982 family drama, Shoot the Moon, about the traumas of a married man in an affair. Citing it as a male character she had seen a zillion times, Jones wondered what a film from the other woman\u2019s point of view would be like. By conjoining this concept with that of her daughter stumbling upon her and her husband\u2019s letters, Love Letters was born. "]}]}}
