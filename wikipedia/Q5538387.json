Once these reliability problems were solved, the squadron, began to specialise in long-range attacks, but this changed in March 1918 when the Germans launched Operation Michael, the opening move of their Spring Offensive. 18 Squadron was among many units deployed to stop the German attacks, resorting to low level attacks as well as more conventional medium level operations.Jones 1934, pp. 312, 324\u2013325, 337, 343\u2013344. As the Germans switched the focus of their operations northwards in the Battle of the Lys, the squadron was again heavily involved, and on 12 April, the squadron carried out six separate attacks in the vicinity of Merville, with 13 pilots flying between them 44 flying hours that day.Jones 1934, pp. 381\u2013383. George Darvill became an ace on DH.4s, scoring nine victories. In September 1918, the squadron began to re-equip with Airco DH.9As, this process continuing until November that year.Thetford Aeroplane Monthly August 1992, p. 18. By the end of the war, the squadron had claimed 200 air-to-air victories. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the fighting on the Western Front, 18 Squadron moved into Germany in support of the Occupation of the Rhineland in early 1919, carrying mail between the British Army of the Rhine and the United Kingdom. The squadron returned to Britain in September 1919 and disbanded at Weston-on-the-Green on 31 December 1919.Rawlings Air Pictorial September 1964, pp. 288\u2013289.Halley 1980, pp. 44\u201345.Ashworth 1989, p. 68."]}, {"page": "List of World War I aces credited with 9 victories", "response": ["| George Darvill"]}, {"page": "William Miller (RAF officer)", "response": ["Miller then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, and was granted a commission as a second lieutenant (honorary lieutenant) on 15 May 1918, to serve as an observer officer.

He gained his first aerial victories while flying with Captain David A. Stewart, accounting for two Fokker D.VII on 30 May 1918.
