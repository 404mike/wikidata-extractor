H. Munro, was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes macabre stories satirize Edwardian society and culture. He is considered by English teachers and scholars as a master of the short story, and often compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker. Influenced by Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, he himself influenced A. A. Milne, No\u00ebl Coward and P. G. Wodehouse.Besides his short stories (which were first published in newspapers, as was customary at the time, and then collected into several volumes), he wrote a full-length play, The Watched Pot, in collaboration with Charles Maude; two one-act plays; a historical study, The Rise of the Russian Empire (the only book published under his own name); a short novel, The Unbearable Bassington; the episodic The Westminster Alice (a parliamentary parody of Alice in Wonderland); and When William Came, subtitled A Story of London Under the Hohenzollerns, a fantasy about a future German invasion and occupation of Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A.

Hector Hugh Munro (1870\u20131916), also known by his pen name of Saki, wrote satirical short stories about Edwardian England. W. Somerset Maugham, who wrote over a hundred short stories, was one of the most popular authors of his time. P.G. Wodehouse published his first collection of comical stories about valet Jeeves in 1917. Many detective stories were written by G.K. Chesterton, Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. Short stories by Virginia Woolf are \"Kew Gardens\" (1919) and \"Solid Objects,\" about a politician with mental problems. Graham Greene wrote his Twenty-One Stories between 1929 and 1954. A specialist in the short story was V.S. Pritchett, whose first collection appeared in 1932. Arthur C. Clarke published his first science fiction story, \"Travel by Wire!\" in 1937.

The biographer Robert McCrum suggests that nonetheless Wodehouse's isolation from his parents left a psychological mark, causing him to avoid emotional engagement both in life and in his works.McCrum, pp. 16\u201317 Another biographer, Frances Donaldson, writes, \"Deprived so early, not merely of maternal love, but of home life and even a stable background, Wodehouse consoled himself from the youngest age in an imaginary world of his own.\""]}, {"page": "Clovis", "response": ["* Clovis Sangrail, a character in the short stories of Saki, named because he was \"so appallingly frank\""]}, {"page": "Bayswater", "response": ["* In Saki's short story \"Cross Currents\" (1909), Vanessa Pennington lives on a \"Bayswater back street\" but would have preferred \"smarter surroundings.\""]}, {"page": "Edwardian era", "response": ["In fiction, some of the best-known names are J.
