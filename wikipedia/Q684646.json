This poem appeared the following year in another collection, England's Helicon, where it was attributed to \"Ignoto\" (Latin for \"Unknown\"). Circumstantial evidence points to a possible authorship by Richard Barnfield, whose first published work, The Affectionate Shepherd, though dealing with the unrequited love of Daphnis for Ganymede, was in fact, as Barnfield stated later, an expansion of Virgil's second Eclogue which dealt with the love of Corydon for Alexis."]}, {"page": "1574 in poetry", "response": ["** Richard Barnfield (died 1620), English poet,"]}, {"page": "Rival Poet", "response": ["Among others, George Chapman, Christopher Marlowe, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, Barnabe Barnes, Gervase Markham,Halliday, pp. 52, 127, 141-2, 303, 463. and Richard BarnfieldLeo Daugherty, William Shakespeare, Richard Barnfield, and the Sixth Earl of Derby, Cambria Press, 2010  have been proposed as identities for the Rival Poet."]}, {"page": "Robert Robinson (phonetician)", "response": ["Even more significant than Robinson's published work, however, is his transcription (unpublished in his lifetime) of several poems by Richard Barnfield into this alphabet.
