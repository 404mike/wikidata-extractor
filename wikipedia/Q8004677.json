Parkes continued to write poetry. A volume entitled Stolen Moments was published in Sydney in 1842. He met the poet Charles Harpur and William Augustine Duncan, the editor of a local newspaper; he mentions in his Fifty Years of Australian History, that these two men became his \"chief advisers in matters of intellectual resource\". In early 1846, he left the Customs Department after a disagreement with Colonel Gibbes over a press leak that concerned the alleged behaviour of one of Parkes' co-workers. Despite this, Parkes would continue to remain on friendly terms with Gibbes and his family for the rest of his life. Gibbes' grandson, Frederick Jamison Gibbes, was also a member of the Parliament of New South Wales in the 1880s and like Parkes became a supporter of federation."]}, {"page": "Augustine (disambiguation)", "response": ["* William Augustine Duncan (1811\u20131885), Scottish journalist and colonial official"]}, {"page": "William Duncan", "response": ["*William Augustine Duncan (1811\u20131885), Scottish journalist and colonial official"]}, {"page": "The Australasian Chronicle", "response": ["First published on 2 August 1839, The Australasian Chronicle was published by Andrew Bent, for William Augustine Duncan, from 1839 to 1843.

The paper was started by Bishop Polding, OSB, and a learned Scottish immigrant, Duncan, a convert to Catholicism. It engaged in vigorous controversy in defence of Catholic interests.J.M. O'Brien, W.

The first foundations of what would become Eagle Street date to 1835 are a track that ran along the river bank along with a small bridge crossing the mouth of Wheat Creek, at what is today the end of Creek Street. William Augustine Duncan selected the site for a port, with a customs house built in 1850 and rapid development of wharves and warehouses followed, by 1851 the name 'Eagle Street' started to be used. From the 1880s boom through to the 1920s, Eagle Street developed into a financial hub with a concentration of offices, insurance firms, and banks. Development was halted by the Great Depression and World War II. In the mid-20th century, the wharves were largely decommissioned and Brisbane's first skyscrapers were built along Eagle Street.", "In 1846 William Augustine Duncan was appointed as the first sub-collector of customs in Brisbane, and selected the site of the Petrie\u2019s old wharf for the settlement\u2019s new customs house which was erected there in 1850.  The construction of the Customs House stimulated wharf development in its vicinity. John Richardson soon erected a wharf and warehouse immediately upstream. George Raff purchased the two allotments adjoining Richardson's wharf, but about 1853 he moved to a location about one hundred metres further upstream and there developed what would become one of the busiest wharves on the river, known as \u201cRaff\u2019s Wharf\u201d. The section of river bank between Raff's Wharf and the mouth of Wheat Creek was acquired by the Queensland Steam Navigation Company, in 1864 the company erected offices, a store, a coal shed and a wharf, all designed for them by the architect James Cowlishaw. In 1859, the Australasian Steam Navigation Company bought their property and developed another wharf further south toward Mary Street. In 1864, James Campbell erected a wharf just upstream from the mouth of Wheat Creek."]}, {"page": "Buderim Mountain State School", "response": ["Despite the importance of the rural sector in the Queensland economy, rural education and training was slow to develop. In 1850 the first president of the Brisbane School of Arts, William Augustine Duncan, urged that an industrial school be established to instruct boys in the \"theory and practice of agriculture and horticulture\" but no action was taken until the 1890s.Moreton Bay Courier, 6 July 1850. In 1897 the Queensland Agricultural College was established at Lawes near Gatton. It provided training for young men in the arts of agriculture and related sciences.Hector Holthouse, Looking Back.

The college was under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Stock and was part of a wider scheme of introducing \"scientific agriculture\" to the colony that also included experimental farms and travelling model dairies.Greg Logan, \"American Prophet among Queensland Farmers: the troubled career of EM Shelton, 1890-98\" in Educational Historian, 3:1, 1990, pp.i-iv."]}]}}
