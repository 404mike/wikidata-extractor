His works were almost all written in the Welsh language, the poems being published under his bardic name, Ieuan Glan Geirionydd.  Seven of his poems are included in The Oxford Book of Welsh Verse.  His best-known poems are perhaps Ysgoldy Rhad Llanrwst, Glan Geirionydd and Cyflafan Morfa Rhuddlan, and his hymns include Rwy'n sefyll ar dymhestlog lan and Mae 'nghyfeillion adre'n myned.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eisteddfod", "response": ["At the 1850 Rhuddlan Royal Eisteddfod, \u00a325 and a Chair Medallion were offered for the best  on the theme  ('the Resurrection').

What the subject was, we do not recall, though it is likely that there was a subject. Not often did a Bard compose without a subject. Evan Evans, Daniel Jones, and W.P. Jones must have competed in the essay competition, adjudicated by the cultured David S. Davies. In the humorous address competition, Evan Evans and Henry Hughes were both winners. There were various recitations by Owen Morris and Thomas Hughes, who were masterly as usual, among others. John S. Davies and his group sang several pieces, and the singers of Bethel also took part. Owen Richards and his brother, Tomy Richards, took part in the first eisteddfod. Johnnie Jones from the same district turned out to be skillful at recitation.

He was of Nonconformist parentage, and his parents are credited with founding the Calvinistic Methodist movement in the area.  He started life as a schoolmaster, but attracted attention by his successes in poetry at various Eisteddfodau, his early imagination being charmed by the picturesque surroundings of his home area.  He subsequently decided to move into the church, and was ordained in 1826.  He was a hymn writer, but suffered from bad health\u2014possibly a reason why his hymns, most in the form of prayers, are considered rather sad and deep.  He held successively the curacies of Christleton and Ince, in Cheshire.  Ill-health compelled him to leave Ince, and he spent some time in retirement among his beloved hills in Trefriw.  When he had partially recovered, he was appointed to the curacy of Rhyl.  He died on 21 January 1855, and is buried in the village cemetery.  His poetical works were published under the title of Geirionydd."]}, {"page": "Cwrtmawr manuscripts", "response": ["The poet, printer, bookseller and bibliophile Gwilym Cowlyd (1828\u20131904) was the source of many of Davies's manuscripts and printed books, although there is uncertainty about the source of some, particularly Cwrtmawr Mss 33 and 42, which even Davies himself noted that he might have acquired from Gwilym Cowlyd.
