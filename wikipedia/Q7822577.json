He is best known for his work with Michael Nyman (having been cellist for the Michael Nyman Band since 1987), Ennio Morricone, and James Horner.  He plays cello as well as Irish whistle and various Andean woodwind instruments.  Due to frequent misspellings of his surname, he is sometimes mistakenly reported as two different musicians due to the diversity of the instruments he plays.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Low whistle", "response": ["Hence, the expression \"Irish low whistle\" is not denoting an Irish origin, but just an intensive use of this instrument in Ireland and, because of cultural similarity, in the whole British archipelago. While before long several notable instrument makersIncluding, among others, Brian Howard, Phil Hardy, Colin Goldie, Dave Shaw (who pursued a rolled conical design), and Jon Swayne (a tunable wooden design) were producing low whistles, it is usually the Riverdance tour of the 1990s that is credited with giving the low whistle commercial exposure and recognition outside traditional music circles. Of particular note is Davy Spillane, whose work in fusing the sound of traditional instruments such as the low whistle with modern jazz or RnB, for example, has done much for the instrument's visibility. Some of the most famous low whistle players are: Michael McGoldrick, Kevin Crawford, Phil Hardy from England, Davy Spillane, Paddy Keenan, John McSherry from Ireland, Brian Finnegan from Northern Ireland, Fred Morrison, Rory Campbell, Tony Hinnigan, and Ross Ainslie from Scotland.
