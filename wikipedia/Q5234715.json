At the election in May 1931, Hardie narrowly held the seat by 883 votes in a straight fight with the Conservative candidate, Herbert James Moss.\nFive months later, at the 1931 General Election, Hardie was swept aside in a landslide defeat, losing by over 5,000 votes to Moss. He never returned to Parliament and thus became one of the shortest-serving MPs of the 20th Century.", "link_mentions": {}}}
