During his period as chair, the council was under pressure due to government-wide spending cuts and reduced corporate patronage due to an economic down turn.  Gibson argued against the imposition of admission fees for public museums and galleries (a measure that in the end was only briefly and partially in place) and defended the council's more controversial funding decisions against charges of elitism. From 1977 to 1986, he was Chairman of the National Trust. a position in which he had personal interest as the owner of Penns in the Rocks, a  estate in Sussex previously owned by William Penn that he bought from the estate of Dorothy Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington in 1957.

About the same time, she ended her relationship with Sackville-West and a long-term one with the poet Dorothy Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington, moving to Penns in the Rocks, a farm on the Wellesley estate in Withyham, East Sussex. In 1933, H. A. L. Fisher commissioned Matheson to write a book she called Broadcasting, which captured the innovative technology of radio and the march of technology, and was still being cited in the 1990s. She also wrote a weekly column for the Week-end Review. Shortly after her book was published, Matheson was hired as secretary to Malcolm Hailey for The African Survey. Lord Lothian, who at the time was at the Royal Institute of International Affairs and Joseph Oldham, secretary of the International Missionary Council, convinced the Carnegie Trust to finance research into British colonial policy in Africa and into the extent to which African races should be involved in policy-making."]}, {"page": "Duchess of Wellington", "response": ["*Dorothy Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington (1889-1956)"]}]}}
