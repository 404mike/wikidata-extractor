He succeeded George Howard as the chairman of the BBC board of governors in 1983 and remained in this role until his early death from cancer in 1986.  When he first became a BBC governor in 1981 he argued that the BBC should be funded by advertising. However, he later changed his mind and argued for the continuation of the television licence during the Peacock Committee. This disappointed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who disliked the television licence and had originally appointed Young believing that, as a Conservative, he would challenge the more left-leaning Director-General of the BBC, Alasdair Milne. She believed that Young had \u201cgone native\u201d and was now supporting the BBC instead of the government.At the time of his death, Young had with his wife Shirley, two daughters \u2013 Lesley and Lynda.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Board of Governors of the BBC", "response": ["*Stuart Young (1983)"]}, {"page": "Young (surname)", "response": ["*Stuart Young (accountant) (1934\u20131986), chairman of the BBC from 1983 until 1986"]}, {"page": "Stuart Young (1934-1986)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stuart Young (accountant)"]}, {"page": "Chairman of the BBC", "response": ["| align=center|Stuart Young"]}, {"page": "Stuart Young (1934\u20131986)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stuart Young (accountant)"]}, {"page": "Stuart Young", "response": ["Stuart Young may refer to:", "* Stuart Young (footballer) (born 1972), English footballer", "* Stuart Young (accountant) (1934-1986), chairman of the BBC board of governors", "* Stuart Young (cricketer) (born 1938), English cricketer"]}]}}
