Prince Albert and Lord Winterton also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favor no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.Mills p.172"]}, {"page": "Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals", "response": ["There were thirty-four essays submitted and in December 1838 the prize was awarded to the Congregational minister Rev John Styles.See Leeds Mercury, 15 December 1838, p 7.

The disadvantage of the breeds of toy spaniel was that their long coats required constant grooming. By 1830, the toy spaniel had changed somewhat from the dogs of Charles II's day. William Youatt in his 1845 study, The Dog, was not enamoured of the changes: \"The King Charles's breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead as ugly and prominent as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its former size, and has an expression of stupidity with which the character of the dog too accurately corresponds.\" Youatt did concede that the breed's long ears, coat and colouring were attractive.Youatt (1852): p. 78 Due to the fashion of the period, the toy spaniels were crossed with Pugs to reduce the size of their noses and then selectively bred to reduce it further. By doing this, the dog's sense of smell was impaired, and according to 19th century writers, this caused the varieties of toy spaniel to be removed from participation in field sports. Blunt-Lytton proposed that the red and white Blenheim Spaniels always had the shorter nose now seen in the modern King Charles.Lytton (1911): p. 14"]}, {"page": "Ryeland", "response": ["  Due to their blocky build they are easy on fences compared to many breeds.

They were reported to be good milk producers, with many being sold to London town dairies. Historically they were well regarded for their suitability for droving to England for sale to Graziers.

Most writers suggest that it is derived from the Talbot, which was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound, also of uncertain origin, though it is sometimes claimed that it came from Normandy. It is suggested that at some point the Talbot was crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed.Smith p.209 However, in The Dog published in 1852, William Youatt states that the Southern Hound may have existed in Britain since ancient times rather than being brought from France by the Normans.Youatt p.133"]}]}}
