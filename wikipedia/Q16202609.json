This is a script-in-hand staging that the actors rehearse for the first time on the same day as the performance. When The Wise Woman of Hoxton was presented, one cast-member recalled how, at the beginning of act four, scene three, Alex Harcourt-Smith, in the role Sencer (who has a soliloquy to the audience at this point in the play), missed his cue: \"After what seemed an eternity (but was probably only a minute or so of dead stage time) the realisation dawned on the actor that it was his \u201cturn\u201d and he exploded on to the stage with a line gifted beautifully to him in the text, \u201cNow or Never!\u201d You can imagine that this brought the house down!\"Chalmers (2016). The soliloquy reads: \"Now or never! Look about thee, Sencer; tomorrow is the marriage day, which to prevent lies not within the compass of my apprehension. Therefore I have disguised myself, to go to the looming woman's, the fortune-teller's, the anything, the nothing. This over against Mother Redcap's is her house. I'll knock\" (4.3.1\u20137).
