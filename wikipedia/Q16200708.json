Ashley is the slightly more mature one of the Jerwayne / Ashley duo, but shares his colleague's vanity and inflated ego. Ashley is shown to be relatively successful with women, at least in terms of getting dates. He believes that expressing an appreciation of the work of the actor Jude Law is a failsafe method of seduction. However, the dates he does go on inevitably end badly; on one occasion he dates an aggressively deranged female soldier who quickly terrifies him into running away. On another, a seemingly beautiful and refined air hostess dampens his ardour through her loutish behaviour during their date. Ashley is extremely sensitive about his growing bald patch and expresses fears that he is becoming unattractive to younger women because of it. Like Jerwayne, Ashley often speaks in a Jamaican English accent, incongruous to his White British heritage and littered with frequent profanity. Ashley is shown in glimpses to be skilled with and appreciative of language; he describes poems he has accidentally received from male British Army soldiers stationed in Afghanistan as \"elegantly structured\" and often uses thoughtful and advanced vocabulary, albeit punctuated with slang and swear words. It is suggested that Ashley does have some ability as a salesman; Razz Prince invites him to interview for the mythical \"Elite Selling Crew,\" an offer Ashley rejects because it would mean competing for the position against his best friend Jerwayne."]}, {"page": "Jack the Giant Slayer", "response": ["* Andrew Brooke as Fye, a giant who is one of Fallon's lieutenants."]}, {"page": "A Town Called Mercy", "response": ["Whithouse preferred the cyborg villain to be three-dimensional and sympathetic, which would require it to have a \"living consciousness\" rather than simply be a \"soulless automaton\".
