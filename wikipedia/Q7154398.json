A league and cup double was denied though when Winsford beat the Millers 1\u20130 a few weeks later. During the 2011 pre-season to mark the club's 125th anniversary Alex Ferguson sent a Manchester United XI to Church Lane. United won 7\u20130, with their team including future England internationals Michael Keane and Jesse Lingard.  In the 2011\u201312 season Pickering led the Millers to a 9th place after a poor winter saw the team slip out of the play-off places. New Mills were placed in the Southern League but after one season were switched to the Northern Premier League. Pickering remained in charge until October 2012, when he and the club parted company by mutual consent.  Former FC United of Manchester coach Roy Soule became caretaker manager on Pickering's departure and almost led the team to another promotion \u2013 they lost 2\u20130 to Trafford in the play-offs. Soule resigned at the end of the 2014\u201315 season after a disappointing season, the club finishing 2nd from bottom and in the relegation places, and further significant budget cuts. The club accepted a reprieve from the FA to stay in the EvoStik league and Soule was replaced by former Stalybridge Celtic manager Keith Briggs. Briggs resigned just 23 days later after accepting a full time coaching role at Sheffield United and was succeeded by his assistant Andy Fearn, who appointed former Manchester City striker Shaun Goater as his assistant. Fearn and Goater resigned after nine matches, all of which were lost, and former Wythenshawe Town staffer Garry Brown took over, supported by ex-Stockport County winger Paul Williams. The club attracted national attention with their unenviable season record of 26 defeats from the opening 26 league and cup games (the team featured in a TV advert voiced by Harry Redknapp, and the chairman stated defiantly in a two-page article in the Daily Telegraph that \"we're not scared of anyone\"); they were relegated in April 2016 with only 3 points, from 3 draws, a Northern Premier League record low.", "The Millers kicked off the 2016\u201317 league season with a 4\u20133 win over Cammell Laird under manager Garry Brown. This was the Millers' first win in almost 18 months. However, Brown resigned in September 2016 after a poor run of results, assistant Paul Williams taking over. In December 2016, with the team lying in the relegation zone of the NWCFL Premier Division, Williams was sacked and replaced by Calum Sykes, who had been in charge at nearby Stockport Town since its formation. Sykes immediately brought the entire Stockport Town team over with him, despite them playing in a lower division; the new team were unable to improve their league position and the Millers were relegated in April 2017, 7 points short of safety. Sykes stayed until November 2017 but resigned after a poor run of results. His assistants Dowse and Cross stayed on as joint managers and despite some heavy defeats steered the club to a 14th-place position (halting a run of two successive relegations). A book has been written about the club's plight by local comedian Carl Jones entitled Winless; it is awaiting publication."]}, {"page": "Andy Kilner", "response": ["In 1988, he joined Altrincham in a player swap deal where he spent the remainder of the 1987\u201388 season. He returned to Sweden soon after, joining V\u00e4nersborgs IF before scoring 20 times in the 1990 season for Jonsereds IF despite suffering a broken leg for the second time in his career in 1989. When the Swedish league season ended, Kilner returned to England as part of his contract allowed him to play for other teams on a non-contract basis during the offseason due to only being paid half salary when the season ended. He was offered a trial with Stockport County by assistant manager John Sainty who had coached him as a youngster at Burnley. He played two matches for Stockport's reserve side, scoring once against Rochdale and twice against Crewe Alexandra. His performances saw him handed his first team debut on 1 January 1991 as a substitute in place of Paul Williams during a 1\u20131 draw with Gillingham. Three days later, he was named in the starting line-up for a league match against Wrexham and scored both goals in a 2\u20130 victory, signing a permanent contract with the club soon after. He quickly established himself in the first team and scored eleven league goals to help the club win promotion from the Fourth Division. However, manager Danny Bergara later made several tactical changes to the club's style of play that ultimately led to Kilner falling out of favour and, after brief loan spells with Rochdale and Bury, he left the club."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Paul Williams (1st Spell)||||DF||2||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||3||0", "|Paul Williams (2nd Spell)||||DF||7||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Paul Williams(1st spell)||||1994||2||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||3||0", "|Paul Williams(2nd spell)||||1995||7||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||0"]}, {"page": "1996 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Plymouth Argyle lost the first leg of their semi-final tie 1\u20130 at Layer Road after a goal from Mark Kinsella,\"Kinsella lifts Colchester\" .
