Following a divorce and struggling financially, Mark moved into his brother David's flat, where John Illsley also lived. In 1977, Mark, John and David decided to form a band. They recruited drummer Pick Withers and began rehearsing. Brinsley Schwarz, a friend of Mark's, helped give the group their name, a reference to their financial situation. After a few months of rehearsals, the band borrowed enough money to record a five-song demo, which included the song \"Sultans of Swing\". They took the tape to disc jockey Charlie Gillett, who had a radio show called \"Honky Tonk\" on BBC Radio London. The band respected Gillett and sought out his advice.
