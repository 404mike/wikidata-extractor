She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal. Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, Allegra, the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh, the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court."]}, {"page": "Augusta Leigh", "response": ["There is some evidence to support the incest accusation. Augusta Leigh's third daughter, born in spring of 1814, was christened Elizabeth Medora Leigh. A few days after the birth, Byron went to his sister's house Swynford Paddocks in Cambridgeshire to see the child, and wrote, in a letter to his confidante, Lady Melbourne: \"Oh! but it is 'worth while', I can't tell you why, and it is not an \"Ape\", and if it is, that must be my fault; however, I will positively reform. You must however allow that it is utterly impossible I can ever be half so well liked else-where, and I have been all my life trying to make someone love me and never got the sort I preferred before.\" \"Ape\" alludes to the fear that the child would be born deformed."]}, {"page": "Medora", "response": ["*Elizabeth Medora Leigh, daughter of Augusta Leigh and possible daughter of Lord Byron"]}, {"page": "Medora leigh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Medora Leigh"]}, {"page": "1814 in poetry", "response": ["* April 15 - Augusta Leigh bears a daughter, Elizabeth Medora Leigh, perhaps by Byron."]}, {"page": "Lord Byron", "response": ["His only marital child, Ada Lovelace, is regarded as a foundational figure in the field of computer programming based on her notes for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
