She has written for Time Out, New Statesman, The Independent and The Independent On Sunday. Her poems have been read on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4 and recorded for The Poetry Sound Archive.\nThe Poetry Society's only official Public Art Poet, her poem \"Eurydice\" was commissioned by the Arts Council and the British Film Institute for the walls of the underpass that leads to the IMAX cinema. This formed part of the regeneration of the South Bank designed by architect Bryan Avery. In 2009, the poem was painted over and then a campaign was launched to restore the poem on the walls of the underpass.Hubbard's novel Rainsongs was published in 2018 by Duckworth London and Overlook NY. Hubbard has described it as 'a novel about my abiding themes: love, loss and redemption'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sean Scully", "response": ["|Sue Hubbard", "|Sue Hubbard"]}, {"page": "Paula Rego", "response": ["Rego is a prolific painter and printmaker, and in earlier years also produced collage work.Sue Hubbard, \"Paula Rego\", Print Quarterly, March 2013, pp. 112-15.

His work became more sculptural and involved not only national identity and collective memory, but also occult symbolism, theology and mysticism. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life. During the 1980s his paintings became more physical, and featured unusual textures and materials.Sue Hubbard (24 October 2008),  Margarete (1981) by Anselm Kiefer (Saatchi collection).
