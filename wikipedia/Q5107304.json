After playing in Shrewsbury's first six league matches he was dropped in favour of Chris Mackenzie. Whilst playing in a reserve fixture on 18 September 2006, Esson sustained a broken cheekbone, and it was later revealed that he would be sidelined for up to ten weeks. Scott Shearer was signed on loan from Bristol Rovers to cover Esson's injury spell. Upon his recovery, Esson could not dislodge him from the first team, and Shearer played out the rest of the season as first choice goalkeeper.

He made four consecutive appearances over the month, concluding on 26 March in the Cross-border derby with Wrexham when he saved a penalty from Matt Crowell in a 2\u20131 away loss.

Neal appeared on the Shrewsbury bench for six league matches but did not make it onto the pitch at Gay Meadow, though he did play the full 90 minutes of the League Trophy match at Hereford United. At the end of the season he was signed by Morecambe as an emergency loan after the club's regular custodian Steven Drench dislocated an elbow, leaving manager Sammy McIlroy to choose between Davies and Neal for the 2007 Conference National play-off Final at Wembley. Despite being awarded a winners medal he did not spend any time on the pitch for the Lancashire club as the club's rookie goalkeeper, Scott Davies, proved up to the task of keeping goal in the club's successful promotion bid.
