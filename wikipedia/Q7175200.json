He played his entire professional career at Cardiff City, making over 400 appearances in a fourteen-year spell between 1960 and 1974 putting him in the top five players with most appearances for the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ninian Park", "response": ["In February 1958, the ground was host to the second leg of the 1958 FIFA World Cup play-off qualifying match between Wales and Israel. Already leading 2\u20130 from the first leg, Wales secured a second victory by the same scoreline to reach the World Cup finals for the only time in the team's history. Later that year, Connies & Meaden were employed again to construct a large roof over the rear section of the Popular Bank and to extend the stand the length of the pitch. In the early 1960s, qualification for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by virtue of winning the Welsh Cup was introduced and Cardiff entered European competition for the first time in the 1964\u201365 season. The side were drawn against Danish semi-professional team Esbjerg fB and the first European tie held at Ninian Park took place on 13 October for the second leg of the fixture. After a goalless draw in the first leg, Peter King scored the only goal of the tie to secure a 1\u20130 aggregate victory for Cardiff in front of a crowd of around 9,000. The low crowd was blamed on the relatively unknown status of the opposition; the club's match against Portuguese side Sporting CP, reigning champions of the competition, in the following round attracted over 23,000 spectators, the biggest home crowd the club had played in front of for nearly two years. This was bettered again in the following round when 38,458 supporters attended a 1\u20130 defeat against Spanish side Real Zaragoza."]}, {"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["Prior to the start of the 1963\u201364 season, the club saw the departures of several key players, including Hooper and Alan Durban. The signing of fellow Welsh international John Charles had raised hopes of improvement but the side struggled throughout the season, winning just 14 league matches out of 42. Allchurch finished as the club's top league scorer, scoring 12 times including a hat-trick against Sunderland in September 1963. The club's struggles saw George Swindin dismissed as manager and replaced by Jimmy Scoular, who had captained Newcastle during Allchurch's spell in the North-East. Allchurch found Scoular's loud and vocal form of management difficult and in mid-October 1964, found himself dropped from the side after recovering from a brief thigh injury as Scoular favoured playing Peter King in his place. He did not return to the first team until February, during which time he stated his desire to leave the club, when Scoular was forced to recall him after the Bluebirds had suffered a severe decline during his absence. Scoular had introduced a new youth policy within the squad, handing regular places to players such as King, George Johnston and Don Murray. Murray later commented that he regarded it as a privilege to play alongside Allchurch and Charles and stated \"There was a saying among the players, if you are in trouble give it to Ivor\"."]}, {"page": "Peter King", "response": ["Peter King may refer to:", "* Peter King (Nigerian musician) (born 1938), Nigerian saxophonist", "* Peter King (saxophonist) (1940\u20132020), English jazz, worked with Charlie Watts", "* Peter King, 1st Baron King (1669\u20131734), Lord Chancellor of England", "* Peter King, 7th Baron King (1776\u20131833), English aristocrat, politician, and economic writer", "* Peter King, 5th Earl of Lovelace (1951\u20132018), British peer", "* Peter King (British politician) (1811\u20131885) Liberal Party MP", "* Peter King (Australian politician) (born 1952), Liberal Party", "* Peter King (Northern Ireland politician), judge and Unionist politician ", "*Peter King (cricketer) (born 1959), Australian", "*Peter King (footballer, born 1943) (born 1943), English footballer with Cardiff City", "*Peter King (footballer, born 1964) (1964\u20132012), English footballer with Crewe Alexandra", "*Peter King (Gaelic footballer) (born 1983), Irish", "* Peter King (British Army officer) (1916\u20131962), during World War II", "* Peter King (make-up artist) (born 1955), for the film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", "* Peter King (sportswriter) (born 1957), American writer for Sports Illustrated"]}, {"page": "List of one-club men in association football", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Peter King||align=\"left\"|England||Cardiff City||1960||1974||14||356"]}, {"page": "Cardiff City F.C.", "response": ["During the 1960s, Cardiff participated in European competition for the first time as a result of winning the Welsh Cup, which granted qualification to the newly created European Cup Winners Cup.
