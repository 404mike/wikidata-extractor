He spent ten days composing tracks and an additional three days to record and mix them for each episode. He opted to create music that was a hybrid between electronic and traditional orchestra, noting that the urban nature of the setting and the attitudes of the characters were an influence. Scherrer said that the CGI nature of the show was a creative challenge, as the themes he scored for the creatures were often based on incomplete images. He noted \"sometimes a drawing of the creature, or just a description from the director may help me get a feel for the creature. The final look and texture can be very influential on the music\"."]}, {"page": "The Honeytrap", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Dominik Scherrer"]}, {"page": "Scenes of a Sexual Nature", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Dominik Scherrer"]}, {"page": "Mark Tilton", "response": ["A graduate of the UEA Creative Writing Course, Tilton wrote the libretto for Hell for Leather, a comic film opera composed and directed by Dominik Scherrer.
