Looney's theory attracted a number of activist followers who published books supplementing his own and added new arguments, most notably Percy Allen, Bernard M. Ward, Louis P. B\u00e9n\u00e9zet and Charles Wisner Barrell. Mainstream scholar Steven W. May has noted that Oxfordians of this period made genuine contributions to knowledge of Elizabethan history, citing \"Ward's quite competent biography of the Earl\" and \"Charles Wisner Barrell's identification of Edward Vere, Oxford's illegitimate son by Anne Vavasour\" as examples. In 1921, Sir George Greenwood, Looney, and others founded The Shakespeare Fellowship, an organization originally dedicated to the discussion and promotion of ecumenical anti-Stratfordian views, but which later became devoted to promoting Oxford as the true Shakespeare."]}, {"page": "Francis Meres", "response": ["Meres had a wife, Mary (1576/1577\u20131631), whose maiden name is unknown.
