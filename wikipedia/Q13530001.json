Macnamara was on the right of his party; he and Burgess joined the Anglo-German Fellowship, which promoted friendship with Nazi Germany. This enabled Burgess to disguise his political past very effectively, while gathering important information about Germany's foreign policy intentions. Within the Fellowship, Burgess would proclaim fascism as \"the wave of the future\", although in other forums such as the Apostles he was more circumspect. The association with Macnamara involved several trips to Germany; some, by Burgess's own later version of events, of a decidedly dissolute nature \u2013 both men were gay and sexually active. These stories, according to the historian Michael Holzman, may have been invented or exaggerated to draw attention away from Burgess's true motives."]}, {"page": "John McNamara", "response": ["*John Macnamara (MP), MP for Leicester in the 1780s", "*John Macnamara (1905\u20131944), British Army officer and politician"]}, {"page": "Wilfrid Roberts", "response": ["With the Conservative MP John Macnamara, Roberts was also joint secretary of the Basque Children's Committee.Stoneham Camp  He worked in the relief effort for Basque refugees, with Christopher Hill as one of his colleagues.Basque Colonies in Great Britain  The initial reception camp for Basque children was at Stoneham in Hampshire, and was organised by Roberts and Henry Brinton, in response to the relief efforts of Leah Manning in May 1937 at Bilbao.
