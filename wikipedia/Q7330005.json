The club were forced to vacate their Anfield Road home and set up at a brand new venue of Goodison Park, leaving behind them their first choice left back, Duncan McLean and forward Alan Wylie. The latter probably realised that the return from injury of Fred Geary would see him left out of the front line but McLean's decision was a surprise to the club and fans and Bob Howarth found himself with six full back partners during the season. For the second year in a row the club struggled to find a first choice keeper as six different custodians filled that role as well, including Joey Murray on three occasions, despite his normal position being as a forward. The indecision in goal was more down to the selectors than poor performance as each defeat the club suffered in the first half of the campaign was met with the keeper being dropped. Eventually the selectors settled for Richard Williams whose regular clean sheets in the latter half of the season saw the club rally to finish the season in third place and reach the cup final."]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["Bob Howarth was the biggest name to leave Goodison Park during the summer as he returned to Preston North End. This gave Charlie Parry the chance to win back the left back shirt that he had lost when Howarth had arrived two years earlier. Reserve goalkeepers, John Whitehead and David Jardine both moved on, to Liverpool and Nelson respectively to seemingly cement Richard Williams' place between the posts. Two other fringe players, defender, Billy Lindsay and half back, Jack Walker left in search of regular first team football at Grimsby and Ardwick respectively. The only major inclusion to the first team squad was the signing of Tom McInnes from Scottish side Third Lanark. He instantly slotted into the inside right birth while Jack Bell moved out to outside left with Alf Milward making way.", "Everton got off to a flying start when winning all their opening eight games and talk of the title coming to Goodison Park was high by the time of the ninth game at Blackburn. It was here that Jack Southworth suffered a leg injury that ended his career and without him Everton's air of invincibility slipped. Blackburn came from behind to beat the ten men and Everton then suffered a string of draws before returning to winning ways. Fred Geary took over at centre forward but yet again found himself losing the berth as Abe Hartley proved more potent in front of goal. Despite having seen off two rivals, Richard Williams' place in goal remained one that the selectors aimed to rectify. Reserves William Sutton and Tom Cain each got their chance but both were considered unworthy, which saw the board spend \u00a3150 to bring 'Happy' Jack Hillman from Burnley with Williams leaving to join Luton. Hillman was established as the regular keeper by the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Tom Cain (footballer)", "response": ["In April 1894, he moved to Everton, making his first team debut as a replacement for the out of form Richard Williams in a 3\u20131 victory over Bolton Wanderers on 6 October 1894. Cain retained his place for a further nine league matches, before Williams was recalled. After two further appearances in March, Cain moved to the south coast to join Southampton St. Mary's for their second season in the Southern League."]}]}}
