The reaction to that article was later analysed by Karl Sabbagh and revealed the hostility that editors can receive when publishing on a sensitive issue. In response to the messages sent to the journal's website and the over 1000 emails sent directly to Abbasi, a sample number were published on-line within 24 hours of submission. Sabbagh explained that the published messages \"were a skewed sample of what had been received, as abusive and obscene contributions were not posted\", In response to these messages, many of which \"abused the BMJ or Abbasi personally\", Abbasi published an editorial entitled: \u201cShould journals mix medicine and politics?\u201d Abbasi noted that the messages were \"largely biased and inflammatory on both sides\" and that a number of people felt that dialogue could resolve the conflict.

For example, emotional numbing is useful in a disaster situation and maladaptive in a family setting, and loss of trust enhances survival in a prison but not in a community setting. Like Derek Summerfield, he also argues against labeling and patronizing treatment. Shay recommends that we resocialize trauma survivors as a means of promoting socially acceptable behavior patterns.Jonathan Shay, quoted from transcript of his interview in the documentary film Voices in Wartime (2005). Written and directed by Rick King. He cites classical Greek theater and the collective mourning described in the Iliad as possible precedents. In Odysseus in America he writes of \"the circle of communalization of trauma\": \"When trauma survivors hear that enough of the truth of their experience has been understood, remembered and retold with enough fidelity to carry some of this truth ... then the circle of communalization is complete.\""]}, {"page": "Children in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict", "response": ["According to John Dugard, the UN Special Rapporteur, regarding the early years of the Al-Aqsa Intifada (2000-2002), most child victims were not participating in demonstrations when they were killed by tank shelling, artillery fire and helicopter gunships.

The World Bank estimated that due to these actions Palestinian poverty had tripled in three years with 60% of the population subsisting at poverty level and over half of households eating just one meal daily. The barrier was isolating 97 primary health clinics and 11 hospitals from Palestinian patients. During that time there were 87 cases in which denial of access to medical treatment caused death, including to 30 children, some babies born while women in labor were kept at checkpoints.
