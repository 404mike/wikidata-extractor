He is currently Distinguished Professor of English Literature at Lancaster University.\nEagleton has published over forty books, but remains best known for Literary Theory: An Introduction (1983), which has sold over 750,000 copies. The work elucidated the emerging literary theory of the period, as well as arguing that all literary theory is necessarily political. He has also been a prominent critic of postmodernism, publishing works such as The Illusions of Postmodernism (1996) and After Theory (2003). He argues that, influenced by postmodernism, cultural theory has wrongly devalued objectivity and ethics. His thinking is influenced by Marxism and by Christian faith.\nFormerly the Thomas Warton Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford (1992\u20132001) and John Edward Taylor Professor of Cultural Theory at the University of Manchester (2001\u20132008), Eagleton has held visiting appointments at universities around the world including Cornell, Duke, Iowa, Melbourne, Trinity College in Dublin, and Yale.Eagleton delivered Yale University's 2008 Terry Lectures and the University of Edinburgh's 2010 Gifford Lecture entitled The God Debate. He gave the 2010 Richard Price Memorial Lecture at Newington Green Unitarian Church, speaking on \"The New Atheism and the War on Terror\". In 2009, he published a book which accompanied his lectures on religion, entitled Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aesthetics", "response": ["* Terry Eagleton (1990), The Ideology of the Aesthetic.

According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Charles Maturin, Sheridan Le Fanu, and Bram Stoker form the core of the Irish Gothic sub-genre with stories featuring castles set in a barren landscape and a cast of remote aristocrats dominating an atavistic peasantry, which represent in allegorical form the political plight of Catholic Ireland subjected to the Protestant Ascendancy.Eagleton, 1995. Le Fanu's use of the gloomy villain, forbidding mansion and persecuted heroine in Uncle Silas (1864) shows direct influence from both Walpole's Otranto and Radcliffe's Udolpho. Le Fanu's short story collection In a Glass Darkly (1872) includes the superlative vampire tale Carmilla, which provided fresh blood for that particular strand of the Gothic and influenced Bram Stoker's vampire novel Dracula (1897). Stoker's book not only created the most famous Gothic villain ever, Count Dracula, but also established Transylvania and Eastern Europe as the locus classicus of the Gothic.Mighall, 2003. Published in the same year as Dracula, Florence Marryat's The Blood of the Vampire is another piece of vampire fiction. The Blood of the Vampire, which, like Carmilla, features a female vampire, is notable for its treatment of vampirism as both racial and medicalised. The vampire, Harriet Brandt, is also a psychic vampire, killing unintentionally."]}, {"page": "Ludwig Wittgenstein", "response": ["* Jarman, Derek.

Watson, and Steven Weinberg have defended Dawkins's stance on religion and praised his work, others, including Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Peter Higgs, astrophysicist Martin Rees, philosopher of science Michael Ruse, literary critic Terry Eagleton, philosopher Roger Scruton, academic and social critic Camille Paglia, atheist philosopher Daniel Came and theologian Alister McGrath, have criticised Dawkins on various grounds, including the assertion that his work simply serves as an atheist counterpart to religious fundamentalism rather than a productive critique of it, and that he has fundamentally misapprehended the foundations of the theological positions he claims to refute. Rees and Higgs, in particular, have both rejected Dawkins's confrontational stance toward religion as narrow and \"embarrassing\", with Higgs going as far as to equate Dawkins with the religious fundamentalists he criticises. Atheist philosopher John Gray has denounced Dawkins as an \"anti-religious missionary\", whose assertions are \"in no sense novel or original,\" suggesting that \"transfixed in wonderment at the workings of his own mind, Dawkins misses much that is of importance in human beings.\" Gray has also criticised Dawkins's perceived allegiance to Darwin, stating that if \"science, for Darwin, was a method of inquiry that enabled him to edge tentatively and humbly toward the truth, for Dawkins, science is an unquestioned view of the world.\" In response to his critics, Dawkins maintains that theologians are no better than scientists in addressing deep cosmological questions and that he is not a fundamentalist, as he is willing to change his mind in the face of new evidence."]}, {"page": "Samuel Beckett", "response": ["* Casanova, Pascale (2007).

He debated this issue with novelist A. S.

Nevertheless, Dean concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"  Critic Terry Eagleton also questioned the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the Archangel Gabriel does him no favours.\""]}, {"page": "D. H.

Critics such as Terry EagletonEagleton, Terry (2005), The English Novel: An Introduction, Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 258\u2013260.  have argued that Lawrence was right wing due to his lukewarm attitude to democracy, which he intimated would tend towards the leveling down of society and the subordination of the individual to the sensibilities of the \u2018average\u2019 man. In his letters to Bertrand Russell around 1915, Lawrence voiced his opposition to enfranchising the working class and his hostility to the burgeoning labour movements, and disparaged the French Revolution, referring to \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" as the \"three-fanged serpent.\" Rather than a republic, Lawrence called for an absolute dictator and equivalent dictatrix to lord over the lower peoples. In 1953, recalling his relationship with Lawrence in the First World War, Russell characterised Lawrence as a \"proto-German Fascist\", saying \"I was a firm believer in democracy, whereas he had developed the whole philosophy of Fascism before the politicians had thought of it.\" Russell felt Lawrence to be a positive force for evil.Bertrand Russell Portraits from Memory (London, Allan and Unwin Ltd) 1956, p. 112. However, in 1924 Lawrence wrote an epilogue to Movements in European History (a text book he wrote, originally published in 1921) in which he denounced fascism and Soviet-style socialism as bullying and \u201ca mere worship of Force\u201d.

Vladimir Nabokov once wrote that good readers do not read books, and particularly those which are considered to be literary masterpieces, \"for the academic purpose of indulging in generalizations\".Vladimir Nabokov Lectures on Literature, chap. L'Envoi p. 381 Terry Eagleton attributes an unsung stature to literary critics and to criticism in academia. He believes that critics are not so well-known and praised, to his disappointment, and that literary criticism is declining in its value because of the manner the general audience is directing it towards that underappreciated state. At a 1986 Copenhagen conference of James Joyce scholars, Stephen J. Joyce (the modernist writer's grandson) said, \"If my grandfather was here, he would have died laughing ... Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man can be picked up, read, and enjoyed by virtually anybody without scholarly guides, theories, and intricate explanations, as can Ulysses, if you forget about all the hue and cry.\" He later questioned whether anything has been added to the legacy of Joyce's art by the 261 books of literary criticism stored in the Library of Congress.D.
