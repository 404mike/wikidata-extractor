He was a character, his skills were unbelievable, his passing, his vision, his dead ball situations.. there was a free kick at a preseason game, we had a wee thing with Watford at the time... and they came about three seasons in a row. I can always remember this one game, Andy had a free kick just over the centre circle...they don't put a wall up or anything and Mick (Jackson) says, it was his first game, \"He's not going to shoot from there\", just leave him I says, he hits the ball in the roof of the net...he was that good\" \u2013 Benny Rooney"]}, {"page": "Albion Rovers F.C.", "response": ["*Benny Rooney (1984)"]}, {"page": "Cambuslang Rangers F.C.", "response": ["*Benny Rooney"]}, {"page": "Petershill F.C.", "response": ["* Benny Rooney"]}, {"page": "Bernie Slaven", "response": ["He was transferred to Greenock Morton in December 1980 for a fee of \u00a3750, but remained with Rutherglen Glencairn for the rest of the season. He made his debut for Morton as a second-half substitute in a 3\u20130 win over Airdrieonians in October 1981. He made his first start against Celtic at Cappielow, and had a goal disallowed during the game, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with Airdrieonians, which was the only goal of his 13 Scottish Premier Division appearances in the 1981\u201382 season. He soon fell out with manager Benny Rooney after demanding more game time. Slaven made nine non-scoring appearances during the 1982\u201383 campaign, and was released in the summer.", "He joined Albion Rovers in April 1983 after being signed by Benny Rooney \u2013 his former manager at Morton; however it would be Rooney's successor, Andy Ritchie, who converted Slaven from a left-half into a centre-forward. In this new position he scored 31 goals in the 1984\u201385 season with many set up by Vic Kasule. Slaven won the 1984\u201385 Daily Record Golden Shot award in the process. Ritchie would not enjoy the benefits of his decision though, as he was replaced by Joe Baker early in the season, and Baker went to also appoint Slaven as club captain. Slaven went on to be named as both the club's and the division's Player of the Year. During this time as a semi-professional he was working as a gardener, but Rovers chairman Tom Fagan demanded \u00a340,000 to sell Slaven, which was a high price for a non-professional third-tier player. Slaven refused to play for Rovers, and was subsequently contacted by a reporter from The Sunday Post, who wrote to 54 English and Scottish clubs on his behalf. Middlesbrough responded to the letter with the offer of a two-week trial."]}]}}
