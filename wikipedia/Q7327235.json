Doyle had been requested by his university to contribute a short piece of literature for a charity magazine. In the story, Watson has received a similar request and whilst he reads the letter at breakfast, Holmes correctly deduces the sender of the letter and Watson's thoughts with regard to the letter. It has many similarities with the canonical stories, most notably the metafictional twist in which Watson supplants Doyle as the author publishing his own stories in a magazine. It also plays upon not only the famous skill of Holmes' observations producing apparently miraculous results, but also the notion of the \"traditional breakfast scenes\" which open many Holmes short stories.Richard Lancelyn Green, \"Introduction\" in ", "When searching through Doyle's papers, Hesketh Pearson, a biographer of his, came across a plan for an unwritten story.

However, according to Jon L. Lellenberg in Nova 57 Minor, the manuscript was not in Doyle's handwriting, but typewritten. The Strand Magazine published extracts from it in August 1943, and it was finally published after demand from Sherlock Holmes societies in 1947, when it was embraced as a new (if slightly inferior) part of the canon by The Baker Street Irregulars amongst others.Richard Lancelyn Green, \"Introduction\" in  Initial suspicions of forgery were reported by Vincent StarretRichard Lancelyn Green, \"Introduction\" in  and it was eventually discovered by Hesketh Pearson that the story was originally written by Arthur Whitaker, who had sent it to Doyle in hope of a collaboration.

Richard Lancelyn Green points out that Raffles shares his first name with Conan Doyle and with Hornung's son, Arthur Oscar Hornung. Raffles's initials are those of Hornung's housemaster at Uppingham School, A. J. Tuck and reversed, those of J. A.

Biographer Peter Rowland notes that these relationships are not shown until the second Raffles story collection, The Black Mask.Rowland (1999), p. 137. \"The latent homosexuality, it should be added (and as Owen Dudley Edwards has pointed out), is played down in the two subsequent volumes of short stories.

Unfortunately, I killed the villain at the end of the story. One day my brother-in-law, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, to whom I owe a very great deal, said to me, 'What a pity you killed that fellow! A public-school villain would be a new figure for a series. Why not revive him?' 'I don't believe I could write such a series to save my life,' I replied. However, I was advised to think the suggestion over.

Hornung described the incident to Tit-Bits in 1909 when discussing Raffles, though the burglar was unimpressive and nothing like the gentleman thief character. Hornung had been asked by a house's caretakers to help them catch a burglar, who tried to hide in a space under the kitchen floor but was ultimately apprehended by a policeman.Hornung (2003) [1899], \"Introduction\" by Richard Lancelyn Green, p. xix.

The poor little performer got two months, but I never heard how much of it was for assaulting the six-foot constable with a missile perhaps the size of a pea!\"", "Raffles is partial to Sullivan cigarettes and keeps them in a silver cigarette case.Hornung (2003) [1899], \"Notes\" by Richard Lancelyn Green, pp. 3, 141.
