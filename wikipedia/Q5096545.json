He turned professional in 1979 and won a place on the European Tour on his first visit to Qualifying School. He played on the Tour through much of the 1980s and 1990s, but didn't always manage to retain his tour card. His best season was 1985, when he finished 33rd on the Order of Merit, and picked up his only European Tour win at the Tunisian Open. He also won the 1986 Zimbabwe Open. After leaving the tour, he ran a golf academy called Swingtime in Grimsby. Bennett was coached by Eric Sharp, father in law to fellow professional Gordon J.

However, competitor Stephen Bennett got with one when he birdied the 10th hole. Reese bogeyed the 12th and 15th holes to lose the lead. Both birdied the 16th but Reese bogeyed the par-3 17th to fall two behind. There was a notable rain delay on the 18th with severe thunderstorms. However \"it eased for a bit\" and the last pair was able to finish. Both men made pars on the last hole and Bennett defeated Reese by two."]}]}}
