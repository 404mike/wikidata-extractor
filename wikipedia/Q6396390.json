Some have achieved fame at bigger clubs after spending their early careers at the club. These include Peter Beardsley, Stan Bowles, Steve Harkness, Matt Jansen, Rory Delap, Danny Graham. Many older players spent their later years at Carlisle United after playing for bigger clubs. These include Michael Bridges, Mervyn Day, Kevin Gray and David McCreery. Former managers include Bill Shankly, Alan Ashman, Bob Stokoe, Harry Gregg, Mick Wadsworth, Nigel Pearson and Paul Simpson. Since Workington was voted out of the Football League in 1977, Carlisle United were the only Cumbrian team to play senior football until Barrow A.F.C. rejoined the EFL in 2020."]}, {"page": "Chris Kamara", "response": ["He signed Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from 1.

Horton used the \u00a32.7 million that Sheffield Wednesday had used to purchase Andy Booth from Huddersfield, to invest in Morrison as well as Marcus Stewart from Bristol Rovers and Andy Payton from Barnsley. Horton, like Allardyce before him, also made Morrison captain. Morrison scored in his debut for Huddersfield against Charlton (which Huddersfield won 2\u20130). Morrison's Huddersfield teammate Ben Thornley described him as 'the hardest person to have ever played football'. Morrison won the respect of fans 'with his braveheart style warrior performances'. A knee injury restricted Morrison's appearances for Huddersfield in the 1996\u201397 season. He was replaced by Sam Collins in a 1\u20130 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in September 1996 and did not play for Huddersfield again until a 0\u20130 draw with Manchester City in November 1996, in which he was replaced by Kevin Gray just after half time. He did not play again until April 1997 when he replaced David Beresford, at half time, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Charlton Athletic. In the 1997\u201398 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 3\u20130 defeat to West Ham United in the League Cup, in which John Hartson scored a hat trick. He also played in Huddersfield's 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon, in the FA Cup, in which Neal Ardley scored the only goal. Huddersfield's poor results in the league that season (they went nine games without a win) led to Horton being sacked. Horton was replaced by Peter Jackson, who managed to keep the team up. Morrison played in Huddersfield's first victory that season, a 3\u20131 win against Stoke City (in which Lee Richardson, Stewart and Paul Dalton scored Huddersfield's goals). He also played in Huddersfield's second win of the season, a 1\u20130 victory against Manchester City at Maine Road, in which Rob Edwards scored the winner. In the 1998\u201399 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 2\u20131 defeat to Everton, in the League Cup, in which Olivier Dacourt and Marco Materazzi scored Everton's goals and Stewart scored Huddersfield's goal.
