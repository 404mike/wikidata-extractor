This anti-semitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party's focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.", "* Robert Forgan was previously Labour Member of Parliament for West Renfrewshire.Julie V.

Jones' biography of Mosley) Lord and Lady Russell of Liverpool."]}, {"page": "Imperial Fascist League", "response": ["In 1932, Robert Forgan approached the IFL and suggested that it should merge into Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, but the offer was declined. Leese rejected any overtures from Mosley because of the latter's initial reluctance to make anti-Semitism a central theme, leading to Leese dismissing Mosley as a \"kosher fascist\". He even dubbed the BUF the \"British Jewnion of Fascists\" over the issue. One of their biggest differences was the fact that the IFL held a biological view of anti-Semitism, the belief that Jews were inherently inferior as a race, in contrast to the BUF, whose eventual adoption of anti-Semitism was framed in ideas about the Jews' supposed undue influence at the top echelons of society."]}]}}
