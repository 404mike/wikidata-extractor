The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest to Power. Oxford University Press, 2014. p.155 The DUP campaigned against the legalisation of homosexual acts, which it believed to be a \"harmful deviance\" linked to paedophilia, in Northern Ireland through the \"Save Ulster from Sodomy\" campaign between 1977\u201382, and the party has vetoed the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland since 2015, making Northern Ireland the only region of the UK where same-sex marriage is not permitted, although provision is now being made under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019. Former DUP minister Jim Wells called the issue a \"red line\" for power-sharing talks, adding that \"Peter will not marry Paul in Northern Ireland\". The party attempted to introduce a \"conscience clause\" into law in Northern Ireland, which would let businesses refuse to provide a service if it went against their religious beliefs. This came after a Christian-owned bakery was taken to court for refusing to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan. Opponents argued that the clause would allow discrimination against LGBT people.\"Bid for \u2018conscience clause\u2019 after gay marriage cake row\" . The Irish Times. 8 December 2014.

In 2021, The Guardian claimed that Arlene Foster softening her stance on LGBT issues was a contributing factor in her resignation as leader. In July 2021, deputy leader Paula Bradley expressed an apology for the \"absolutely atrocious\" statements made by the party's politicians about LGBT people and added \"there have been some very hurtful comments and some language that really should not have been used.\u201d.
