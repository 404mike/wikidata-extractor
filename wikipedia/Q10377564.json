Transferred to Ipswich Town F.C. in September 1973, he had to wait over two years for his League debut, Manchester City held 1\u20131 at Maine Road on 25 October 1975. Over the following two seasons Sharkey played 18 League games, scoring just once in a 2\u20131 win at Arsenal in April 1976. He was awarded his only cap against Scotland in May 1976. It was a disappointing match all round. Northern Ireland were again forced to play another \"home\" match in Glasgow despite the fact England, Wales, Sweden and Norway had all played in Belfast in the previous twelve months. Scotland, 2-0 up at half-time, cruised to an easy 3\u20130 win with Sharkey replaced after 61 minutes.\nNever really established at Portman Road, Sharkey made his final top-flight appearance against Middlesbrough on 23 April 1977 and was released that summer. In August he signed with Mansfield Town who were embarking on their first ever season in Division Two. Despite a career best tally of five goals, including a penalty strike against England 'keeper Peter Shilton in a 2\u20131 win over Stoke, Sharkey couldn't help the Stags avoid instant relegation. New Mansfield boss Billy Bingham allowed Sharkey to leave Field Mill in the summer of 1978.\nBobby Roberts brought Sharkey to Colchester at the start of the 1978/79 campaign, and he got off to a bad start, missing a crucial penalty in a League Cup tie with Charlton. He never really established himself at Layer Road, his apparent lazy attitude not going down well, and was transferred to Peterborugh United on transfer deadline day 1979.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1953", "response": ["** Pat Sharkey, Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "Omagh", "response": ["*Pat Sharkey (b. 1953) \u2013 Ipswich Town F.C. and Northern Irish football player in the 1970s."]}, {"page": "Sharkey", "response": ["* Pat Sharkey (born 1953), former footballer from Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "August 26", "response": ["*  1953   \u2013 Pat Sharkey, Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Pat Sharkey", "|Pat Sharkey", "|Pat Sharkey"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Pat Sharkey"]}]}}
