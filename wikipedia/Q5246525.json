The author is rumoured to have described it as 'a werewolf whodunnit seen through the eyes of John le Carr\u00e9.' This was expected likely be published sometime around Christmas 2014 according to the author, but will initially be a Kindle-only book.\nDean revealed in August 2014 that he was a huge supporter of self-publishing and the 'new and exciting possibilities now available to authors via digital publishing.' As well as publishing three travel diaries on Amazon, he also hinted at several new works of fiction coming to Kindle (initially) with releases every month from September through December. One of these is very likely to be Werewolves of London, while the titles Four and Twenty and The Hammer have been teased via Facebook in 2014. He has a Jack the Ripper novel in the works, but there is 'no update at the moment except to say I'm still very excited about it and am taking my time to ensure it is as faithful to the accepted history of the case as possible.'", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tenbury Wells", "response": ["*Dean Vincent Carter, author"]}, {"page": "The Hand of the Devil (novel)", "response": ["The Hand of the Devil is a 2006 fantasy horror novel written by Dean Vincent Carter.
