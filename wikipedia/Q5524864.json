Prior to this he had come through the youth academy at Watford and played for both Scarborough before a stint in the Scottish Football League with Gretna. He retired in 2007 following a knee injury he sustained at Grimsby but has since come out of retirement on two occasions and has played at Non-League level for St Albans City, Royston Town, AFC Hornchurch and Soham Town Rangers. He also had a brief stint as a competitive road racing cyclist in between his two playing spells.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["|2006|| Rob Jones || Gary Cohen"]}, {"page": "Michael Reddy", "response": ["The 2005-06 campaign began with Grimsby firing on all cylinders. With Reddy the star in a strong team that never dropped out of the top 4 all season. His ability to run with the ball, make play, create and score goals earned him hero status amongst the club's supporters. His impressive partnership with new signing Gary Jones was arguably one of the best in the league. Between them, Reddy and Jones managed to find the net 31 times throughout the season. During the season, the club had a decent run in the League Cup defeating both Derby County and Tottenham Hotspur, before losing to Newcastle United. Michael was involved in all three games. Reddy's impressive performances had also earned him the right named in the League 2 Team of the Year. But in an unfortunate twist of fate, Reddy's season was cruelly interrupted by a hip injury in March and as a result the striker did not complete another ninety minutes for the remainder of the campaign. The Mariners faltered and fell out of the automatic promotion places on the penultimate day of the season. Reddy was deemed fit enough to take part in the play-off campaign, but it was goals from Gary Jones and Ben Futcher that defeated Lincoln City in the semi final stages. Slade opted to play Reddy from the start in the final at the Millennium Stadium against Cheltenham Town but luck fell against him as he was substituted with concussion after a clash of heads. Grimsby attempted to use Junior Mendes and Gary Cohen to help cater for Jones in attack, but without Reddy, the club went on to lose the game 1\u20130, ending all hopes of promotion after a promising season."]}, {"page": "Gary Cohen (disambiguation)", "response": ["Gary Cohen (born 1958) is an American sportscaster.", "Gary Cohen may also refer to:", "*Gary Cohen (footballer) (born 1984), English cyclist and former footballer", "*Gary Cohen (health advocate), American environmental activist and health advocate"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|15 ||  Gary Cohen || Released || 23 || Retired through Injury"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|15 ||  Gary Cohen || Gretna || 22 || Loan", "|15 ||  Gary Cohen || Gretna || 22 || Free Transfer"]}, {"page": "Glen Cohen", "response": ["He is the father of professional footballer, Gary Cohen.

Cheltenham made the better start and the first chance fell to Gillespie in the seventh minute, following a long pass from McCann, but Steve Mildenhall, the Grimsby goalkeeper, made the save.  Three minutes later, a mistake from Jones allowed Guinan to shoot, but his strike was straight at Mildenhall; Woodhouse's shot then cleared the Grimsby crossbar by some distance.  In the 17th minute, Finnigan's attempt went wide before an aerial collision between Craig Armstrong and Reddy forced both players to be substituted, Mickey Bell coming for Cheltenham and Gary Cohen for Grimsby.  In the 33rd minute, Parkinson claimed he was fouled in the Cheltenham penalty area by Gavin Caines, but no penalty was awarded.  Four minutes later Jones headed the ball wide of the Cheltenham goal, and after another two, Wilson struck a shot wide.  In the last minute of the first half, Shane Higgs saved a low shot from Cohen before Parkinson's strike went over the crossbar.
