She is said to have led the school from being \"on the brink of closure\" to becoming over-subscribed. During her tenure, members of the school's choir sang, initially unbeknownst to her, on Pink Floyd's number one hit: \"Another Brick in the Wall Part II\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Another Brick in the Wall", "response": ["Alun Renshaw, head of music at the school, was enthusiastic, and said later: \"I wanted to make music relevant to the kids \u2013 not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great \u2013 'We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control'\u00a0... I just thought it would be a wonderful experience for the kids.\" Renshaw hid the lyrics from the headteacher, Margaret Maden, fearing she might stop the recording. Maden said: \"I was only told about it after the event, which didn't please me. But on balance it was part of a very rich musical education.\" Renshaw and the children spent a week practising before he took them to a recording studio near the school. According to Ezrin, when he played the children's vocals to Waters, \"there was a total softening of his face, and you just knew that he knew it was going to be an important record\". Waters said: \"It was great\u2014exactly the thing I expected from a collaborator.\""]}, {"page": "City of London Academy Islington", "response": ["* Margaret Maden, headteacher from 1975-1983"]}, {"page": "1940 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 16 April \u2013 Margaret Maden, academic"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["| Jock Bruce-Gardyne, Ray Buckton, Margaret Maden, John Methuen"]}, {"page": "Margaret maden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margaret Maden "]}]}}
