Burns scored 733 first-class runs, but only passed 50 on five occasions, including a top score of 124 not out against Essex. Four wins late in the season pushed Somerset up to fourth in the second division of the County Championship, but the county were knocked out of the 2004 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy in the third round, and they finished eighth of ten in the second division of the totesport League. Their elimination from the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy came at the hands of Worcestershire; after Somerset had won the toss and Burns had chosen to bat, his side were bowled out for 95 runs, the tenth lowest List A total for the county. Burns was dismissed for a first-ball duck in the match, which Wisden reported was dominated by the \"muscular hostility\" of Andy Bichel, who took four wickets for Worcestershire. Both Burns and Somerset's first-team coach, Kevin Shine were criticised for the team's failures; Shine was reassigned as the county's academy director, while a committee of former captains was set up to assess the captaincy. On the recommendations of the group, composed of Roy Kerslake, Vic Marks and Brian Rose, Somerset signed the captain of the South Africa national cricket team, Graeme Smith, to lead them in 2005."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Kevin Shine (1996\u20131998) 33 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Southampton Evening Cricket League", "response": ["Several notable Test and county cricketers have played in the league, including Robin Smith, Kevin Shine, Gary Brent and Adrian Aymes.
