In 1938 he enlisted in the Highland Light Infantry as a boy soldier and reached the rank of Corporal before transferring to the Army Physical Training Corps in 1941. He served with the APTC in North Africa and Italy and left the Army in 1946 with the rank of Warrant Officer Class II.He then joined the West Riding Constabulary as a Constable, representing the force in boxing and rugby. He attended the National Police College in 1954 and was promoted Inspector in 1955 (after the statutory minimum nine years' service) and Superintendent in 1960. In 1956 he was a British Memorial Foundation Fellow in Australia and that year he was also called to the bar by the Middle Temple. He attended the Senior Command Course at the Police College in 1963\u20131964 and was then appointed Deputy Chief Constable of Dorset.In 1966, he transferred to the Metropolitan Police in London as Deputy Commander (Administration and Operations) and in 1967 became second-in-command of No.3 District (North-East London). In 1968 he became Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Training) and in 1970 was seconded as Commandant of the National Police College. In 1973 he returned to London as Assistant Commissioner \"D\" (Personnel and Training), but remained in the post less than a year before being appointed Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall in November 1973, where he remained until his retirement in May 1982.\nWhile Chief Constable he acquired a reputation for radical ideas which were not always popular with other senior police officers, who regarded him as \"soft\", and was also a champion of community policing. Alderson was frequently portrayed in the media as the polar opposite to James Anderton, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester from 1976 to 1991, who was seen as a champion of hardline, aggressive policing and a more punitive criminal justice system.\nHe was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in 1974 and appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1981.\nHe became a Fellow Commoner of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and a fellow of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology in 1982 and was also Gwilym Gibbon Research Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford from 1982 to 1983. He was Visiting Professor of Police Studies at the University of Strathclyde from 1983 to 1989 and a research fellow at the Institute of Police and Criminological Studies at the University of Portsmouth from 1994 to 2000. He returned to Australia in 1987 as Australian Commonwealth Fellow with the Australian Government. He often commentated on police matters in the media.\nAlderson was a member of the Liberal Party and unsuccessfully contested the Devon parliamentary seat of Teignbridge in 1983. He served as a consultant on human rights to the Council of Europe from 1981 and was a member of the BBC General Advisory Council from 1971 to 1978. He also served on the committee of the Royal Humane Society from 1973 to 1981 and was president of the Royal Life-Saving Society from 1974 to 1978.\nAlderson married Iren\u00e9 Macmillan Stirling in 1948; they had one son.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Orgreave", "response": ["As a direct result of Saltley, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) established the National Reporting Centre (NRC) which would be \"operationalised in times of industrial or political crisis [to provide] a coordinated national response to demands on policing\". The NRC assumed the power \u2013 \"endorsed by the Home Secretary\" \u2013 to deploy police officers from any force in the country to areas of \"high tension\" and \"across force boundaries without the knowledge or consent of local police authorities\". Speaking in October 1984, John Alderson, the former deputy chief constable of Dorset Police, criticised the NRC as a \"de facto national police\". In addition, events in the early 1980s, such as the national steel strike of 1980 and the riots in inner-city areas such as Brixton and Toxteth, had led police forces to train officers to deal with mass protests differently. For example, officers during the 1981 riots had been left using dustbin lids to protect themselves from missiles, whereas the police at Orgreave had all been equipped with riot shields.", "David Hart, a right-wing political activist and adviser to MacGregor, the NCB, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, claimed that Orgreave was \"a set-up by us\". He said in a 1993 interview, \"The coke was of no interest whatsoever. We didn't need it. It was a battleground of our choosing on grounds of our choosing. I don't think that Scargill believes that even today. The fact is that it was a set-up and it worked brilliantly.\" Following his comments, senior managers from the NCB denied these claims and threatened Hart with disassociation. John Alderson, in Principled Policing: Protecting the Public with Integrity (1998), wrote that if MacGregor and Hart's claims were true, the \"conspiracy to draw the miners into mass pickets and predictable violent conflict between the police and themselves\" constituted a \"deceit... tantamount to incitement\"."]}, {"page": "James Anderton", "response": ["Anderton's outspoken views sparked public controversy throughout his period as chief constable of Greater Manchester. The media often depicted Anderton as the polar opposite of John Alderson, chief constable of Devon and Cornwall. While Alderson was portrayed as a liberal and progressive thinker who favoured community or \"soft\" policing, Anderton was often depicted as a tough, uncompromising and bombastic figure who endorsed a philosophy of \"hard\" paramilitary policing against crime and public disorder. Anderton disagreed with this juxtaposition, stressing that his policing in Greater Manchester was community-based."]}, {"page": "Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis", "response": ["*John Alderson, 1973"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["| John Alderson, Dianne Hayter, Roy Shaw, Teddy Taylor", "|John Alderson, Alan Clark, Sheila Rothwell, Arthur Scargill"]}, {"page": "John Alderson", "response": ["John Alderson may refer to:", "*John Alderson (physician) (1758\u20131829), English physician", "*John Alderson (footballer) (fl. 1930\u20131932), English footballer", "*John Alderson (actor) (1916\u20132006), English-born Hollywood actor", "*John Alderson (police officer) (1922\u20132011), British police officer, Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall, 1973\u20131982", "*John Alderson (cricketer) (born 1929), New Zealand cricketer"]}, {"page": "The Chief (TV series)", "response": ["The Chief  is a British television crime drama series that aired on ITV from 20 April 1990 until 16 June 1995.

Later, focus shifted towards Stafford's replacement, Alan Cade (Martin Shaw). The series was produced by Anglia Television and was mostly filmed and set in East Anglia. The series was notable for a lot of political content, in particular for Stafford's battles with the Home Office and local politicians.Mike Ashley, The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Modern Crime Fiction (2002), p. 541.

Peel's ideas included that the police needed to seek the cooperation of the public and prioritize crime prevention. The term \"community policing\" came into use in the late 20th century, and then only as a response to a preceding philosophy of police organization.Karpiak, Kevin G., \"Community Policing\" in Encyclopedia of Criminal Justice Ethics, SAGE Publications, , 2014"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2011", "response": ["*John Alderson, 89, British police officer and media commentator, Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary (1973\u20131982)."]}, {"page": "John Cottingham Alderson", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Alderson (police officer)"]}, {"page": "J.
