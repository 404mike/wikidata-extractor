He was a businessman and banker in the UK.\nHis parents were the merchant Edward Strakosch and his wife Mathilde, (n\u00e9e Winters). He was born at Hohenau, Austria, and educated at the Wasa Gymnasium in Vienna and privately in England.He entered banking in the City of London in 1891, then began working for the Anglo-Austrian Bank of South Africa in the 1895. Strakosch became a naturalized British citizen in 1907.\nHe served as a financial adviser to the South African government, and was the author of the 1920 South African Currency and Banking Act.  He was chairman of the South African goldminers, Union Corporation from 1924.  He was a member of the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance during 1925 and 1926. He later served on the Council of India between 1930 and 1937, served as a delegate for India at the Imperial Economic Conference in 1932, and acted as adviser to the Secretary of State for India between 1937 and 1942.\nStrakosch was knighted in 1921, then created a KBE in 1924, and promoted GBE in 1927.  He was awarded an honorary degree of LLD at Manchester University in 1938.He was chairman of The Economist between 1929 and 1943.\nStrakosch being a Jew and his involvement in the payment of the private debts of Sir Winston Churchill, in 1938 and again in June 1940, has been cited as evidence of Jewish involvement in British politics in the run up to World War II. Strakosch had supplied Churchill with figures on German arms expenditure during the latter's political campaign for rearmament against the Nazi regime, and the financial arrangement enabled Churchill to withdraw his home Chartwell from sale at a time of financial pressures. Strakosch also bequeathed Churchill \u00a320,000 in his will.Strakosch was unmarried until 1941 when he married Mabel Elizabeth Vincent, daughter of John Curnow Millett of Pempol, Cornwall, and widow of Joseph Temperley,  a shipowner.He died at his home, after an unsuccessful operation, at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 1943 aged seventy-two.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chartwell", "response": ["In 1938, Churchill, beset by financial concerns, again considered selling Chartwell, at which time the house was advertised as containing five reception rooms, nineteen bed and dressing rooms, eight bathrooms, set in eighty acres with three cottages on the estate and a heated and floodlit swimming pool. He withdrew the sale after the industrialist Henry Strakosch agreed to take over his share portfolio, which had been hit heavily by losses on Wall Street, for three years and pay off significant associated debts. In September 1938, the Russian Ambassador, Ivan Maisky, made his first visit and recorded his impressions of Chartwell: \"A wonderful place! A two-storey house, large and tastefully presented; the terrace affords a breathtaking view of Kent's hilly landscape; ponds with goldfish of varying size; a pavilion-cum-studio with dozens of paintings - his own creations - hanging on the walls; his pride and joy, a small brick cottage which he was building with his own hands\". His impression of his host was somewhat less favourable; asked what special occasion would lead Churchill to drink a bottle of wine dating from 1793 from his cellar, Churchill had replied - \"We'll drink this together when Great Britain and Russia beat Hitler's Germany\". Maisky's unspoken reaction was recorded in his diary, \"Churchill's hatred of Berlin really has gone beyond all limits!\""]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["** Sir Henry Strakosch (3 June)"]}, {"page": "German question", "response": ["In 1931, there was an attempt to create a customs union between the Weimar Republic and Austria.
