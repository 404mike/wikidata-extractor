Following the appearance of William Dugdale's Antiquities of Warwickshire (1656), a pattern was set. In the nineteenth century John Bowyer Nichols followed the line of a history of Leicestershire compiled by his father John Nichols, and saw numerous counties histories through the press at his printing firm. The scope of county histories varied, but the titles became quite standard: \"Antiquities of\", \"Worthies of\", \"Geological survey\", \"Description of\", later \"Directory of\", all could indicate the intention of producing a \"history\", a term that only in later times acquired the narrower meaning it carries today.
