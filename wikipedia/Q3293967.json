In the late 1990s Anastasios Melis discovered that deprivation of sulfur induces the alga to switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis) to the production of hydrogen. He found that the enzyme responsible for this reaction is hydrogenase, but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis also discovered that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted their internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy Chlamydomonas moewusii is also a promising strain for the production of hydrogen."]}, {"page": "1885 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 24 January \u2013 Marjory Stephenson, biochemist (died 1948)"]}, {"page": "John Yudkin", "response": ["He worked for his PhD in the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge under the supervision of Marjory Stephenson, a pioneer of research in bacterial metabolism, who funded his work.

In its reply, the Council stated that the question of women fellows \"must depend on the interpretation to be placed upon the Royal Charters under which the Society has been governed for more than three hundred years\". When Hertha Ayrton was nominated for fellowship in 1902, her candidature was turned down on the basis that as a married woman she had no standing in law. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 made it illegal for an incorporated society to refuse admission on the grounds of an individual's sex or marital status. While the Society acknowledged the provision of section 1 of the Act in 1925, in reply to a question originally put to them by the Women's Engineering Society three years prior, it was not until 1943 that another woman was nominated for fellowship.

In 2013 she was chosen to speak at the Soapbox Science event in London which she then brought back to Swansea University to challenge the public's perception of women as scientists and to inspire the next generation of female scientists. Hilary also helped Newcastle University set up events. She presented a TED lecture in 2016 entitled \"MOVE OVER BOYS: Why we need more girls/women in STEM Careers\" about gender equality in science. In 2016 Hilary attracted the British Science Festival to Swansea University, the legacy of which continues in the form of the Swansea Science Festival, an annual event which aims to inspire generations around science and its applications in everyday life."]}]}}
