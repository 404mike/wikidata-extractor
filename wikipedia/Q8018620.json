He was born into a wealthy London family, the son of Col. William and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Sloan) Sotheby, and was educated at Harrow School and the Military Academy, Angers, France before joining the army at 17, where he served for six years until his marriage in 1780, when he devoted himself to literature.Sotheby then became a prominent figure in London literary society. His wealth enabled him to play the part of patron to many struggling authors, and his friends included Walter Scott, Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Robert Southey, Arthur Hallam, and Thomas Moore.He published a few dramas and books of poems that had limited success; his reputation rests upon his translations of the Oberon of Christoph Martin Wieland, the Georgics of Virgil, and the Iliad and Odyssey by Homer. The last two were begun when he was over 70, but he lived to complete them. His Georgics in particular advanced his reputation and was praised in the Edinburgh Review as, if not \"the most perfect translation of a classic poet now extant in our language, it is assuredly capable of being advanced to that high distinction.\"He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in November 1794.Sotheby died in London in 1833 and was buried in Hackney churchyard. Joanna Baillie, a close friend of Sotheby's for \"nearly thirty years\" mourned his passing: \"A more generous, high-minded, amiable man never lived, and this, taken together with his great talents & acquirements, makes a Character which cannot be replaced.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1757 in literature", "response": ["*November 9 \u2013 William Sotheby, English poet and translator (died 1833)"]}, {"page": "Netley Abbey", "response": ["Keate was followed by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight, 1790). Sotheby's view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of Richard Harris Barham's Ingoldsby Legends (1837\u20131845) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun in one of the vaults and ensuring God's revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, while at the same time showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins."]}, {"page": "Loughton", "response": ["Poets associated with Loughton include Sarah Flower Adams (1805\u20131848), and Sarah Catherine Martin (c. 1766 \u2013 1826), author of the nursery rhyme \"Old Mother Hubbard\", who is buried in the churchyard of St. Nicholas Church, Loughton.
