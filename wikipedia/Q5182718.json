He claimed that his step-daughter, Augusta Talbot, had been forced to join the Franciscan Convent in Taunton as a postulant (the first stage to become a nun), rather than a pupil. Her father had died in 1839 and then her mother, after remarrying, died in 1841, and with the subsequent death of her brother, she was due to inherit \u00a380,000. After the death of her mother, Talbot had been placed in the care of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, her father's half-brother. Berkeley alleged that the Shrewsburys first attempted to marry her to Fran\u00e7ois VII de La Rochefoucauld, and then when she refused, placed her at the Taunton convent against her will. The allegation followed that when Talbot became a nun, her inheritance, which was due to her in June 1852, would become property of the convent, or the greater Catholic church. Berkeley also protested that he and his daughter were not allowed to communicate with Talbot, though Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro, the Lord Chancellor, noted that Berkeley had not tried to see Talbot for nine years. Lord Truro contacted Talbot, who stated that she was not a postulant, and she was amenable to his plans to remove her from the convent and place her in the care of a new guardian in London. He duly did so, and rejected Berkeley's petition, upon the basis of his previous lack of contact with Talbot."]}, {"page": "Thomas Doyle (priest)", "response": ["The case involved Craven Berkeley, Augusta's stepfather. He had married Augusta Talbot (n\u00e9e Jones), widow of George Henry Talbot and Augusta's mother, in 1839; she died in 1841. Doyle made a petition for access to Augusta (Doyle v Wright) in 1840. The custody petition of March 1851 continued that case. Popular interest in the issue linked anti-Catholic feeling with Augusta Talbot's status as an heiress to \u00a380,000, around the allegation that the Catholic Church would profit if she died a nun."]}]}}
