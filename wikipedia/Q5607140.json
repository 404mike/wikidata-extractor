On the other hand, he also describes the snow on frozen Long Island Sound in February and March 1968 (when he was composing Stimmung in Madison, Connecticut), as \"the only landscape I really saw during the composition of the piece\". In a letter to Gregory Rose written on 24 July 1982 (printed in the liner notes to Hyperion CDA66115), he describes how, in the small house his wife Mary had rented it was only possible for him to work at night because their two small children needed quiet during the day. He could not sing aloud, as he had done initially, but began to hum quietly, listening to the overtone melodies. Mary reports that Stockhausen first discovered the technique when listening to their small son Simon producing multiple tones while humming in his crib after falling asleep. In this way, Stockhausen became \"the first Western composer to use this technique of singing again\u2014in the Middle Ages it had been practised by women and children in churches, but was later entirely supplanted by masculine Gregorian music\".", "* Stockhausen: Stimmung (Singcircle version).
