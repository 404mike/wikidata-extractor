Alan Young belonged to a Dickens Society and was asked to help adapt the story to fit in Disney characters. Young, whose parents were Scottish and who lived in Scotland for a few years when he was an infant, voiced Scrooge for this record in addition to voicing Mickey Mouse and Merlin from The Sword in the Stone. When Disney decided to adapt the record into the 1983 theatrical short, Mickey's Christmas Carol, Young returned to voice Scrooge. Young remained as Disney's official voice for Scrooge until his death in 2016, although Will Ryan voiced Scrooge for the 1987 television special, Sport Goofy in Soccermania and Alan Reid voiced Scrooge for Tuomas Holopainen's 2014 album, Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge. Young's last performance as Scrooge was in the 2016 Mickey Mouse short, \"No\"."]}, {"page": "Battlefield Band", "response": ["Battlefield Band was formed in 1969 by five student friends from Strathclyde University (Brian McNeill, Jim Thomson, Alan Reid, Eddie Morgan and Sandra Lang, who became crime fiction author Alex Gray) and took its name from the Glasgow suburb where McNeill was living at the time. After several line-up changes and an album recorded for a minor Breton label, the band was signed to Topic records and released its official self-titled debut in 1977 with the line-up of McNeill (fiddle, vocals), Reid (keyboards, vocals), Jamie McMenemy (bouzouki, vocals), and John Gahagan (whistle). Gahagan left before the recording of the follow-up, At the Front (1978), and was replaced by Irish singer-guitarist Pat Kilbride. The departure of both Kilbride and McMenemy shortly afterward brought in Jen Clark (vocals, cittern, dulcimer) and Duncan MacGillivray (Highland pipes) for Stand Easy (1979), thus beginning Battlefield Band's tradition of using bagpipes on their albums. Clark was replaced by Northumbrian singer-guitarist Ged Foley on Home is Where the Van Is (1980), which marked a switch from Topic records to producer Robin Morton's label Temple. Home is Where the Van Is also inaugurated the band's practice of placing original songs alongside traditional material. The line-up changes continued, though the group remained based around the core of McNeill and Reid until 1990, when McNeill left to pursue a solo career. Reid finally left the band at the end of 2010, concentrating on his musical duo with guitarist & singer Rob van Sante, the Battlefield Band's sound engineer.", "The band's 2006 album, The Road of Tears, deals explicitly with the theme of displacement. Many of the songs deal with emigration, both voluntary and forced. Battlefield Band's 2007 album, Dookin\u2032 (the Scots word for what you do at hallowe'en \u2013 as in \"'dookin' for apples\") has a lighter feel, after the eloquently somber tone of The Road of Tears. Dookin' includes instrumentals and a mix of vocals, with lead being shared by Alan Reid and Sean O'Donnell.", "#Alan Reid [1969\u20132010] (founding member; keyboards, guitar, vocals, accordion, melodica, Hammond organ, writing) \u2013 "]}, {"page": "Alan Reid", "response": ["Alan Reid may refer to:", "*Alan Reid (artist) (born 1976), American artist", "*Alan Reid (Australian footballer) (born 1956), businessman and former Australian rules footballer for East Fremantle, Essendon and Geelong", "*Alan Reid (courtier) (born 1947), Treasurer to Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom", "*Alan Reid (cricketer) (born 1931), Australian cricketer", "*Alan Reid (footballer, born 1926) (1926\u20131988), Australian rules footballer for Geelong", "*Alan Reid (journalist) (1914\u20131987), Australian political journalist", "*Alan Reid (musician) (born 1950), Scottish musician (ex-Battlefield Band member)", "*Alan Reid (politician) (born 1954), Scottish Liberal Democrat MP for Argyll and Bute", "*Alan Reid (Scottish footballer) (born 1980), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Alan Reid,  folk multi-instrumentalist and songwriter"]}, {"page": "Threads (Battlefield Band album)", "response": ["*Alan Reid"]}, {"page": "Across the Borders", "response": ["*Alan Reid"]}, {"page": "Leaving Friday Harbor", "response": ["* Alan Reid (keyboards, guitar, vocals, writing...)"]}, {"page": "Rain, Hail or Shine", "response": ["* Alan Reid (keyboards, guitar, vocals, writing...)"]}, {"page": "Home Is Where the Van Is", "response": ["*Alan Reid: vocals, organ, synthesizer, electric piano", "The band played the album in its entirety at the 2009 Celtic Connections, as part of the festival's Classic Albums series.
