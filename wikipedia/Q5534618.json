He was Commissioner and then Governor of British Somaliland between 1913 and 1922, and was responsible for finally quelling the twenty-year-long Dervish resistance wherein Diiriye Guure was monarch and Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (\"Mad Mullah\") was the emir of Diiriye Guure.\nFrom 1922 to 1925, Archer was appointed Governor of Uganda. He later served as Governor-General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan between 1925 and 1926. In the Sudan, Archer paid a formal but friendly visit to Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, son of the self-proclaimed Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad, whose forces had killed General Gordon in 1885. Abd al-Rahman was leader of the neo-Mahdists in Sudan. Archer was eventually forced to resign due to the resultant flap, and spent the remainder of his career organising salt works in India.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Archer's ground robin", "response": ["The bird's common name commemorates the British explorer and colonial official Sir Geoffrey Francis Archer."]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors of British Somaliland", "response": ["|May 1914 to October 1919||rowspan=2| ||Geoffrey Francis Archer, Commissioner||", "|October 1919 to 17 August 1922||Geoffrey Francis Archer, Governor||From 5 June 1920, Sir Geoffrey Francis Archer"]}, {"page": "List of governors of pre-independence Sudan", "response": ["|5 January 1925 to 6 July 1926|| ||Sir Geoffrey Francis Archer, Governor-General||The first civilian Governor-General"]}, {"page": "1920 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Geoffrey Francis Archer  Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Somaliland Protectorate"]}]}}
