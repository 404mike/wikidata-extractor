He claimed a notable Classic double-double in 1978 when landing The Derby and Irish Derby on Shirley Heights and the Oaks and Irish Oaks on Fair Salinia. Other big races he won in this country included the Ascot Gold Cup (3 times), the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes, Eclipse Stakes (twice), Champion Stakes and Sussex Stakes.\nAs well as Classic success on Shirley Heights and Fair Salinia, Starkey landed the 1964 Oaks on Homeward Bound and the 2,000 Guineas on To-Agori-Mou in 1981 and Dancing Brave in 1986.

Over the same course and distance two weeks later he started 15/8 favourite against fourteen opponents in the 2000 Guineas. Ridden by Greville Starkey, he quickened in the closing stages of a slowly run race to win by three lengths from Green Desert and Huntingdale. After the race, Starkey was confident that the colt would stay one and a half miles in the Derby, although Harwood was more cautious.", "In The Derby a month later Dancing Brave started favourite, despite concerns about his ability to stay the distance of twelve furlongs. Starkey employed exaggerated waiting tactics and Dancing Brave was close to last place entering the home straight. Switched to the outside to make his challenge, Dancing Brave accelerated in the last quarter mile, being clocked at 10.3 seconds for the penultimate furlong. He failed to catch the leader Shahrastani finishing second by half a length. His jockey, Greville Starkey, was widely criticised for his tactics, but he has been defended by others, including Harwood, who pointed out that the race was run at a muddling pace and that Starkey could only have won if he had \"cut the horse in half\", which as the stable jockey he was unwilling to do. Starkey kept the ride for Dancing Brave's next race, Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. Racing against older horses for the first time he won in \"breathtaking style\" by four lengths from Triptych and Teleprompter. However, when Starkey was injured and unable to ride the horse in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot he was replaced by Pat Eddery who became the preferred choice in the colt's remaining races. The Ascot race saw a rematch between Dancing Brave and Shahrastani. Since winning the Derby, Shahrastani had won the Irish Derby by eight lengths and started favourite for the King George. Eddery produced Dancing Brave's run earlier than usual, taking him into the lead over a furlong from home and the colt had to be ridden out to hold off Shardari by three-quarters of a length, with Triptych third, Shahrastani fourth and Petoski fifth."]}, {"page": "Irish 1,000 Guineas", "response": ["| Greville Starkey"]}, {"page": "Irish Oaks", "response": ["| Greville Starkey"]}, {"page": "Pat Eddery", "response": ["In the following decade, Eddery became associated with the Irish Ballydoyle stable of Vincent O'Brien and gained further classic success on Kings Lake, Lomond, Golden Fleece, Assert and El Gran Senor. In 1986, on the choice of the horse's owner, he took over from Greville Starkey as the rider of Dancing Brave. He partnered Dancing Brave to victory in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and became the worldwide retained jockey of the colt's owner, Khalid Abdullah. While the press played up in the course of years the controversy between Starkey and Eddery, Eddery had been most reticent and underplayed the apparent falling out. Major winners in the Abdullah colours included Zafonic, Quest for Fame, Warning and Toulon. He was Champion Jockey a further seven times in eleven years between 1986 and 1996. His epic battle for championship in 1987 with American Steve Cauthen was particularly intense, with Cauthen winning the title with 197 and Eddery coming close at 195, and but for an objection from the third horse after the last definitive race in which Eddery won against Cauthen making the Championship a tie, the title would have been a shared one.To be a Champion, by Pat Eddery In the year 1988, Eddery completed 183 winners from 480 odd rides \u2013 which was a great strike rate, and regained the title."]}, {"page": "Sun Chariot Stakes", "response": ["| Greville Starkey"]}, {"page": "Poule d'Essai des Poulains", "response": ["| Greville Starkey", "| Greville Starkey"]}, {"page": "Prix Jean Prat", "response": ["| Greville Starkey"]}, {"page": "Prix du Moulin de Longchamp", "response": ["| Greville Starkey"]}, {"page": "Prix Vermeille", "response": ["| Greville Starkey"]}, {"page": "Prix Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re", "response": ["| Greville Starkey"]}]}}
