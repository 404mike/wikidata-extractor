She defeated McKane in singles and mixed doubles, the latter of which was with Henri Cochet as her partner for the second consecutive year. With Ryan absent, however, Lenglen partnered with Golding and lost to the British team of McKane and Geraldine Beamish. At the French Championships, Lenglen defended her triple crown without losing a set in spite of the challenge round format being abandoned. She partnered with Brugnon in mixed doubles for the third straight year, while pairing up with Julie Vlasto for the first time in doubles. She faced the most adversity in the singles final when the crowd uncharacteristically booed her for trailing 0\u20134 to Golding in the second set. At Wimbledon, Lenglen won the singles and doubles titles with ease, never dropping more than three games in a set. In mixed doubles, however, she was defeated by Ryan and Lycett for the second time in the year. In September, Lenglen travelled outside of France and won titles in Belgium, Spain, and Portugal."]}, {"page": "Henri Cochet", "response": ["| 1922 || World Hard Court Championships || Clay ||  Suzanne Lenglen ||  Geraldine Beamish   John Gilbert || 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 6\u20130"]}, {"page": "Queen's Club Championships", "response": ["| 1923 ||  Elizabeth Ryan ||  Geraldine Beamish || 6\u20132, 1\u20136, 6\u20132"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Ryan", "response": ["| style=\"background:#98fb98;\" | Win || 1921 || Wimbledon || Grass ||  Suzanne Lenglen ||  Geraldine Beamish   Irene Bowder Peacock || 6\u20131, 6\u20132"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1920 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Geraldine Beamish", "| Alfred Beamish  Geraldine Beamish", "| Geraldine Beamish  Edith Holman"]}, {"page": "Dorothy Holman", "response": ["Holman was born in Kilburn, London.
