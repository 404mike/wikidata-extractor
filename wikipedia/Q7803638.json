In the first series, the men live and work on a building site in D\u00fcsseldorf. The series was created by Franc Roddam after an idea from Mick Connell, a bricklayer from Stockton-on-Tees, and mostly written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who also wrote The Likely Lads, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? and Porridge. It starred Tim Healy, Kevin Whately, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, Christopher Fairbank, Pat Roach and Gary Holton, with Noel Clarke replacing Holton for series three and four and the two-part finale. The series were broadcast on ITV in 1983\u20131984 and 1986.

The rest of the series is driven by the interactions and growing friendships between the various characters. Barry (Timothy Spall), an electrician from the Black Country, is an obsessive bore; Neville (Kevin Whately), one of the Geordie bricklayers, is an insecure young newlywed; fellow Geordie Oz (Jimmy Nail), another bricklayer, is aggressive and jingoistic; and London joiner Wayne (Gary Holton) is a womaniser. The third Geordie is Dennis (Tim Healy), a bricklayer who, being older, more experienced and generally more mature than the others, becomes the de facto leader of the group. The others are Bristolian bricklayer Bomber (Pat Roach) and Scouse ex-con plasterer Moxey (Fairbank). Over the course of 13 episodes the \"Magnificent Seven\" enjoy comic, dramatic, and romantic adventures, until a change in German tax laws forces them to return home.", "The second series had several on-set problems. Actor Gary Holton died before some of the final indoor scenes were filmed, and the scripts had to be reworked to explain Wayne's absence from these indoor scenes. Examples of this include various characters enquiring about Wayne's whereabouts, only to be told that he was chatting up a girl in the next room or that he had gone away for the day. A double was used in other scenes, such as one where Bomber manhandles Wayne away from Ally's girlfriend in a nightclub. The transmission of the final episode of Series 2 (Quo Vadis Pet) saw an introduction by Tim Healy dedicating the episode to Holton.", ":Dennis (Tim Healy) is the co-opted leader of the \"Magnificent Seven\". When introduced, he is in the middle of divorcing his wife Vera. He later has an affair with a German on-site secretary named Dagmar, played by Brigitte Kahn.  In series two, he is working for a Newcastle upon Tyne gangster, Ally Fraser, to whom he has fallen in debt. Dennis has two children and can sometimes be short-tempered, but is basically a thoughtful man of high moral standards and has good people skills. At the opening of the third series, he is driving a mini-cab for a living and supplementing his income, much to his own shame, by working as a drug-dealer's driver."]}, {"page": "James Maxwell (actor)", "response": ["* Zack by Harold Brighouse with Tim Healy and Bridget Turner (1986)"]}, {"page": "Vic and Bob", "response": ["In 2004, in collaboration with Steve Coogan, Reeves and Mortimer produced The All Star Comedy Show, a two-part special for ITV.
