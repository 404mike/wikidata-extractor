The sport of cricket in this period had already acquired most of its modern features such as eleven-a-side, the three-stump wicket and the lbw law, although pitch preparation was rudimentary and play was largely dictated by the weather. The main difference was in bowling which was still mostly underarm, the key development of the period being the movement towards roundarm bowling which began in the late eighteenth century and was gathering pace by 1825.\nThe principal club throughout the period was Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in 1787. MCC organised the early Gentlemen v Players matches and most of the games played by occasional XIs such as those led by Colonel Lennox, Lord Frederick Beauclerk, George Osbaldeston and others. Inter-county cricket was rare during the Napoleonic Wars and there were no formally constituted county clubs at the time, but the main centres at county level were Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex. Towards the end of the period, Cambridge University became prominent, especially through its series of matches against the Cambridge Town Club. In the north of England, cricket was developing through town clubs which became the focal points of the game in their respective counties, especially Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1787 and 1825 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dean (surname)", "response": ["Dean is a surname of Anglo-Saxon English origin. Retrieved 29 June 2018 It is originally derived from the Old English word \"denu\" (Middle English, \"dene\") meaning \"valley.\" Another common variant of this surname is Deane.", "Dean is thought to be a habitational name from any of several places in various parts of England that are known by a variation of the name. The first bearers of the name lived in Anglo-Saxon England in mountainous or hilly areas where they would have adopted the name as a habitational marker. The surname is historically concentrated in the West Country in South West England, particularly in and around the county of Gloucestershire, Retrieved 29 June 2018 and there are several places called Dean in the area (including other areas of Southern England), suggesting that this region may be the surname\u2019s likely area of origin. Dean and Deane are also historically found as surnames in Scotland and Ireland.", "Perhaps less likely, it may also be a descriptive name for someone thought to resemble an ecclesiastical Dean, or an occupational name associated with the servant of a Dean, derived from the Middle English word \"deen,\" which is itself ultimately derived from the Latin word \"decanus\" (modern English, Deacon), meaning \"a leader of ten men\".", "Recorded usage of the name dates back to the late 11th century when it was recorded as the surname of several individuals. The first known person on record to use the Dean surname appears to have been an individual named Robert de Dene, who was a \"Pincema\", or, an official in charge of wine and beverage for King Edward the Confessor (1042\u20131066). His descendants, known as Denn or Denne, were landowners in Kent and Sussex, but apparently died out by the 1600s. Another known early Dean was an individual named Ralph De Dene, who was recorded in the Domesday Book for Sussex during the reign of William the Conqueror (1066\u20131087) in 1086.", "The official use of surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. Until the gradual standardization of English spelling in the last few centuries however, English lacked any comprehensive system of spelling. Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents, meaning that a person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. As such, different variations of the Dean surname usually have the same origin.", "*Angela Dean, British statistician", "*Anna-Maria Ravnopolska-Dean, harpist", "*Bashford Dean, American ornithologist", "*Brenda Dean (1943\u20132018), British trade unionist and politician", "*Brett Dean (born 1961), Australian composer", "*Charles Dean (died 1974), brother of Howard and Jim", "*Charmaine Dean (born 1958), statistician from Trinidad, president of Statistical Society of Canada", "*Christopher Dean, British figure skater", "*Dean (Middlesex cricketer) (fl. 1787\u20131790), English amateur cricketer", "*Dixie Dean, English footballer", "*Dizzy Dean (1910\u20131974), baseball pitcher", "*Dora Dean (c. 1872\u20131949), vaudeville dancer", "*Eddie Dean (disambiguation), several people", "*Elton Dean, jazz musician", "*Everett Dean (1898\u20131993), American college sports coach", "*Fred Dean (1952\u20132020), American football player", "*Gordon Dean (disambiguation), several people", "*Henry Clay Dean, American orator and author", "*Howard Dean, U.S. presidential candidate in 2004", "*Jamel Dean (born 1996), American football player", "*James Dean (disambiguation), several people", "*James Dean (1931\u20131955), American actor", "*Janet Dean Fodor, American professor of linguistics", "*Jim Dean (activist), chairman of Democracy for America", "*Jimmy Dean (1928\u20132010), American singer and actor", "*Joe Dean (1930\u20132013), American basketball player, sportscaster, and sports administrator", "*John Dean (born 1938), White House counsel to President Nixon and central Watergate figure", "*Julia Dean (actress, born 1830) (1830\u20131868), actress", "*Julia Dean (actress, born 1878) (1878\u20131952), actress", "*Kevin Dean (disambiguation), multiple people", "*Letitia Dean (born 1967), English actress and singer", "*Madeleine Dean, American politician", "*Margia Dean, (born 1922), American actress", "*Mark Dean (swimmer), American swimmer", "*Matt Dean (born 1966), American politician", "*Matthew Deane (disambiguation), several people", "*Mike Dean (disambiguation), multiple people", "*Millvina Dean (1912\u20132009), British civil servant, last living survivor of the Titanic disaster", "*Nakobe Dean (born 2000), American football player", "*Nathan Dean (1934\u20132013), American businessman and politician", "*Nathaniel Dean, Australian actor", "*Nathaniel W.
