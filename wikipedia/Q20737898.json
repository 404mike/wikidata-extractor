He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire and died at Warwick.\nA right-handed lower-middle-order batsman, right-arm off-break bowler and a very occasional wicketkeeper, Bromley made his first-class debut on his 17th birthday in 1947 against Scotland and was 12 not out at the close of play, though he had failed to take a wicket when Scotland batted. He did not add to his score the following day, and then played only occasional matches for the first team, through to 1951, though he was a regular in the second eleven which competed in the Minor Counties competition from 1949.From 1952 to 1954 he played in around half of Warwickshire's matches, though with a few exceptions he had limited impact with both bat and ball. Against Essex in 1952, he scored an unbeaten 121, but it was his only century and in the 1952 season as a whole his batting average was just 21.88. In the 1953 game with Worcestershire, he took five second innings wickets for 61 runs, his only return of five wickets in an innings; but in the very next match he was upstaged by the part-time off-breaks of Bert Wolton and was dropped from the team.Bromley left regular cricket after the 1954 season, although he returned, without success, for a single match in 1956. He continued to play intermittently for Warwickshire's second team in the Minor Counties Championship and the Second Eleven Championship through to 1968.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bromley (surname)", "response": ["* Philip Bromley (1930\u20132007), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Philip Bromley (1947\u20131956) : P.
