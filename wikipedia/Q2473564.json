A monk named Gao Juhui sent to the Western Regions writes that the people in Ganzhou (now Zhangye) taught him how to make \"horse hoof muse\", which had four holes in it that connected to four holes in the horse's hoof, and were thus put together. They also recommended using yak skin shoes for camel hooves. Iron horseshoes however did not become common for another three centuries. Zhao Rukuo writes in Zhu Fan Zhi, finished in 1225, that the horses of the Arabs and Persians used metal for horse shoes, implying that horses in China did not. After the establishment of the Yuan dynasty in 1271 AD, iron horseshoes became more common in northern China. When Thomas Blakiston travelled up the Yangtze, he noted that in Sichuan \"cattle wore straw shoes to prevent their slipping on the wet ground\" while in northern China, \"horses and cattle are shod with iron shoes and nails.\" The majority of Chinese horseshoe discoveries have been in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Sichuan, and Tibet.http://culture.people.com.cn/BIG5/n/2015/0430/c22219-26930801.html"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Thomas Blakiston (1832\u20131891), English naturalist. \"Blakiston's Line\" separates animal species of Hokkaid\u014d and northern Asia, from  those of Honsh\u016b and  southern Asia.
