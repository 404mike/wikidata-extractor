Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4\u20130 at home to Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8\u20132 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973\u201374 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodeve; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and spent too much time away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; he felt that he had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975\u201376, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976\u201377 and then into the top-flight in 1978\u201379."]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Andy Rollings", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Andy Rollings", "| Andy Rollings", "| Andy Rollings"]}, {"page": "Rollings", "response": ["*Andy Rollings (born 1954), English football centre back"]}]}}
