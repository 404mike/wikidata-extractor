The Impressions Show with Culshaw and Stephenson also contains sketches where impressionist Debra Stephenson portrays Pat in situations, often with Coronation Street character Ken Barlow, played by Jon Culshaw.  She is also the frequent target of jokes in Harry Hill's TV Burp, usually alluding to her former prostitution and alleged sexual promiscuity. Comedian Lee Evans had once used Pat as one of his jokes in his tour Live at the O2 Arena.
