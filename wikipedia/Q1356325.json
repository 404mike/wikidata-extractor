Two of his brothers also played tennis, including 1890 Wimbledon quarter finalist David Grainger Chaytor. Tom played at Wimbledon once in 1894, where he beat Horace Chapman, Clement Cazalet and Ernest George Meers, before handing a walkover to Wilfred Baddeley in the semi finals (he couldn't play because of badly blistered feet). In 1894, Chaytor reached the final of the Irish Open, where he faced Joshua Pim. Chaytor hit great passing shots and his backhand was winning him a lot of points. Pim won, but only by the score of 9\u20137 in the fifth set."]}, {"page": "Essex Championships", "response": ["| 1887 || Ernest George Meers || P. M.
