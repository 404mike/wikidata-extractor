This is so due to the rivalry between the Gunners and the Blues being non existent at the time. Upon Drake's arrival at Chelsea, he made a series of sweeping changes, doing much to rid the club of its previous amateurish, music hall image. He discarded the club's Chelsea pensioner crest and with it the Pensioners nickname, and insisted a new one be adopted. From these changes came the Lion Rampant Regardant crest and the Blues nickname. He introduced scouting reports and a new, tougher, training regime based on ballwork, a rare practice in English football at the time. The club's previous policy of signing unreliable big-name players was abandoned; Drake instead used his knowledge of the lower divisions and the amateur game to recruit little-known, but more reliable players. These included John McNichol, Frank Blunstone, Derek Saunders, Jim Lewis and Peter Sillett"]}, {"page": "London XI", "response": ["Team: Ron Reynolds (Tot), Peter Sillett (Che), Jim Fotheringham (Ars), Stan Willemse (Che), Ken Armstrong (Che), Derek Saunders (Che), Harry Hooper (Wes), Johnny Haynes (Ful), Cliff Holton (Ars), Eddie Firmani (Cha), Billy Kiernan (Cha).", "Team: Jack Kelsey (Ars), Stan Charlton (Ars), Peter Sillett (Che), Ken Coote (Bre), Bill Dodgin (Ars), Derek Saunders (Che), Roy Dwight (Ful), Jimmy Greaves (Che), Cliff Holton (Ars), Johnny Haynes (Ful), Billy Kiernan (Cha)."]}, {"page": "Ware F.C.", "response": ["* Derek Saunders"]}, {"page": "List of Chelsea F.C. players", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" data-sort-value=\"Saunders, Derek\" |  Derek Saunders"]}, {"page": "History of Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["In 1954\u201355, the club's jubilee year, everything clicked.

He juggled his playing time with working as a salesman for Thermos flasks which, unlike many of his fellow players, allowed him to have a car.
