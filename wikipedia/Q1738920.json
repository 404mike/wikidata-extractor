Coming into politics through local government in West Yorkshire, Woolmer was elected to Parliament for the Labour Party in 1979. He became an effective Parliamentarian and was rapidly promoted, despite clearly allying to the party's right-wing and playing an active role in the intra-party conflict. Partly due to adverse boundary changes, he lost his seat in 1983 and was unable to win it back. Later in life he received a life peerage and was an active member of the House of Lords.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kenneth Woolmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Woolmer, Baron Woolmer of Leeds"]}, {"page": "Baron Woolmer of Leeds", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Woolmer, Baron Woolmer of Leeds"]}, {"page": "Kenneth John Woolmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Woolmer, Baron Woolmer of Leeds"]}, {"page": "Lord Woolmer of Leeds", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Woolmer, Baron Woolmer of Leeds"]}, {"page": "Kettering Grammar School", "response": ["* Kenneth Woolmer, Baron Woolmer of Leeds, Labour MP from 1979 to 1983 for Batley and Morley"]}, {"page": "Ken Woolmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Woolmer, Baron Woolmer of Leeds"]}, {"page": "Woolmer (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Kenneth Woolmer, Baron Woolmer of Leeds (born 1940), British university lecturer and politician"]}]}}
