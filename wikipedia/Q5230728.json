The plaintiff's lawyers wrote a letter which concluded \"His attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of your reply\". The magazine's response was, in full, \"We acknowledge your letter of 29th April referring to Mr J. Arkell. We note that Mr Arkell's attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of our reply and would therefore be grateful if you would inform us what his attitude to damages would be, were he to learn that the nature of our reply is as follows: fuck off\". In the years following, the magazine would refer to the exchange as a euphemism for a blunt and coarse dismissal, \"We refer you to the reply given in the case of Arkell v. Pressdram\".
