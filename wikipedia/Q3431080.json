O'Dwyer's lawyer Ben Cooper opposed extradition, stating that the site acted as a mere conduit, and should be afforded the same protection given to search engines such as Google and Yahoo!. Ben Cooper also argued that any criminal prosecution should be brought in the UK, as TVShack was not hosted on American servers.On 13 January 2012, UK District Judge Quentin Purdy rejected those arguments and ruled that O'Dwyer could be extradited to the U.S. to face copyright infringement allegations. The extradition order was approved by then UK Home Secretary Theresa May in March, 2012, and O'Dwyer launched an appeal.On 28 November 2012, it was announced that O'Dwyer had signed a deferred prosecution agreement to avoid extradition. He was ordered to pay a fine of \u00a320,000 and remain in contact with a US correctional officer over the next six months. In return, the United States would drop all charges.Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the judge, called the outcome \"very satisfactory\", adding, \"It would be very nice for everyone if this was resolved happily before Christmas\".O'Dwyer now works as director of a computer software business and racing driver.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sheffield Hallam University", "response": ["* Richard O'Dwyer, TV Shack creator"]}, {"page": "Bolsover", "response": ["* Richard O'Dwyer \u2013 computer programmer, creator of TVShack.net, whom the United States sought to extradite over alleged copyright infringement"]}, {"page": "Gary McKinnon", "response": ["* Richard O'Dwyer"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Wales", "response": ["In 2012, the Home Secretary of the U.K. was petitioned by Wales in regard to his opposition to the extradition of Richard O'Dwyer to the U.S. After an agreement was reached to avoid the extradition, Wales commented, \"This is very exciting news, and I'm pleased to hear it ...
