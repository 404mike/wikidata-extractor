Later in the century, painters followed Ruskin's ideas about 'natural composition', that is Nature, rather than human beings, was the model to go to, rather than pictorialism and the making of panoramas. The close-up view and accuracy of observation led to the \"Romantic cult of the sketch or study\" that was taken up by later painters of the Lake District. The landscape realists of the 1850s onwards did detailed studies in front of the subject and were often linked with the Pre-Raphaelite movement and with the newly established National Schools of Art and the increasing patronage of the museums and galleries of Liverpool and Manchester. Atkinson Grimshaw and Daniel Alexander Williamson are two representatives of this movement.Victoria and Albert Museum (1984), pp. 94, 138\u2013140."]}, {"page": "List of Pre-Raphaelite paintings", "response": ["===Daniel Alexander Williamson==="]}, {"page": "James Campbell (artist)", "response": ["*Daniel Alexander Williamson"]}, {"page": "William Davis (artist)", "response": ["*Daniel Alexander Williamson"]}, {"page": "John Lee (artist)", "response": ["* Daniel Alexander Williamson"]}, {"page": "William Lindsay Windus", "response": ["*Daniel Alexander Williamson"]}]}}
