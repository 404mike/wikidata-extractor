He was loaned out to Northampton Town, Oldham Athletic, Notts County and Bristol Rovers, but never won a regular first team place at Wolves. He made a permanent move to Sheffield Wednesday in June 2010, and was a squad member as the \"Owls\" were promoted out of League One in 2011\u201312. He joined Port Vale in January 2013, and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313. He left the club in April 2014 after a training ground bust-up, and signed with Chesterfield the following month. After three years with Chesterfield, he joined Notts County in July 2017. He left County after the club were relegated out of the Football League and went on to sign for Cambridge United in July 2019.

Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons.

On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place \u2013 far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation.

Oldham played a Friday night match versus local rival Stockport County, who sat in 7th place at the time. Oldham controlled the first half of the match, as an Andy Liddell goal in the 24th minute gave them a 1\u20130 halftime lead. However, Stockport dominated the second half, scoring three goals en route to giving Oldham their first defeat of the season. An 82nd-minute goal from Stockport defender Michael Raynes secured the victory, as the Hatters defeated Oldham 3\u20131. After dropping to third place, Oldham looked to regain the top spot in the league versus Hereford United. Lee Hughes got the action started quickly, scoring his fourth goal in the fifth minute of the game. Oldham continued their early pressure against the Hereford defence, which included Hughes earning Oldham a penalty kick after he was taken down in the area by Frenchman Bruno Ngotty\u2014with Andy Liddell converting on the penalty to give Oldham a 2\u20130 advantage. Wolves loaned defender Daniel Jones netted in the 36th minute for the Latics, giving the home side a 3\u20130 lead at the halftime break. Stephen O'Leary picked up a yellow card in the 81st minute for taking down Jones with a bad challenge, and was sent off only a minute later, forcing Hereford to play out the final minutes with only ten men. Danny Whitaker took advantage of the sending off, netting the final goal in the 90th. Oldham played their third game of the month on 18 October against Leicester. A lackluster first half of action led to scoreless action until the 54th minute, when a Steve Howard header gave the visitors a 1\u20130 lead. Danny Whitaker equalised a quarter-hour later, earning a 1\u20131 draw as Oldham maintained an unbeaten home record. Three days later, Oldham traveled to Memorial Stadium to face Bristol Rovers. A solid attack was stifled by Rovers goalkeeper Steve Phillips, who stopped all seven shots that were on target. Rickie Lambert netted his 11th goal of the season in the 16th minute, which led the way to a Chris Lines goal in the 35th minute. Phillips and Oldham's Mark Crossley both kept out the opposition for the remainder of the match, as Oldham dropped their second consecutive away match. For their second straight away match, Oldham faced Swindon Town who sat in 18th place in League One. Oldham looked to be in control in the first 20 minutes of the match, putting pressure on Swindon's net without any success. Shortly after their barrage on the goal, defender Sean Morrison scored for Swindon. A handball in the penalty area by Lee Hughes gave Swindon the opportunity to net another in the 34th minute, which was converted by Jack Smith to double Swindon's lead. The ball was bogged down in midfielder for second half, as neither side put pressure on goal\u2014letting Swindon wrap up their third home victory of the season. A Lewis Alessandra assured that Oldham would end October on a high note, as the striker scored his first hat trick in a 3\u20130 victory over Scunthorpe United. The 19-year-old led Oldham struck first in the 26th, before quickly earning his hat trick in the second half with goals in the 50th and 60th minutes.

The game started in a slow fashion, although Wednesday did look the more likely team to score as it was not until midway through the first half until goalkeeper Stephen Bywater had a touch of the ball. And although both sides created hardly any chances, it was a foul in the box by Lewis Buxton that gave MK Dons a penalty. Shaun Williams dispatched the ball into the net to give the home side the lead. Seconds later MK Dons should have had another penalty, but it was not given, after Martin Taylor appeared to foul his man in the box. Paul Corry and Nejc Pe\u010dnik came close, but the Owls trailed at half-time by a goal to nil. The second half started much more lively, but chances for both sides were still rare. Danny Mayor tested the opposition goalkeeper before the second goal of the match came. With fifteen-minutes to go a free-kick by Dean Bowditch, aiming for players in the box, managed to miss everyone and find its way into the net. Ex-Owl Ryan Lowe had a chance to score a third before the full-time whistle, but it was nt to be.

With severe weather conditions of snow affecting the country with many postponed games, Sheffield Wednesday's home game against Wolverhampton Wanderers did manage to beat off the snow and continue. Wednesday were sitting at the top of the form table coming into this game and the first half it was obviously why. The Owls dominated the first half with Michail Antonio coming very close on several occasions, meanwhile Jermaine Johnson also came close on many occasions. Kieran Lee was inches wide with a couple of chances, while R\u00e9da Johnson had his header stopped just on the line by the opposing goalkeeper. Somehow though it remained goalless at the break. Into the second half and Michail Antonio again had some wonderful chances which were not taken, and J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan also missed the back of net with two glorious opportunities.

Another tough match followed with Coventry City, and supporters were treated to an entertaining game that saw the Valiants twice come from behind to record a 3\u20132 victory. Immediately following the game Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery. His first game in charge was a 1\u20130 victory at Tranmere Rovers, with Chris Lines' well taken free-kick being enough to win the three points. Page also took charge of the 1\u20131 home draw with Bristol City, and admitted the players performed well below their best. Adams returned on crutches for the home encounter with high-flying Peterborough United and tried a new diamond formation in midfield; the tactic brought a good performance out of the side, but a late strike for \"Posh\" left Vale with a 1\u20130 defeat. The next game was against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, and Adams was again disappointed at his boyhood club as Vale were beaten 2\u20131, with Daniel Jones sent off for two yellow cards after just 20 minutes. After the match Adams showed concern over the lack of club discipline on display as Myrie-Williams publicly argued with Adams after being substituted and Pope and Robertson had a heated discussion on the pitch.
