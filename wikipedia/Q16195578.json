He is the author of seven books and the editor of three. He has published over one hundred articles and reviews in such journals as The Nation, The New Criterion, In These Times, The Athenaeum Review, the Journal of the History of Ideas, the Journal of Interdisciplinary Economics, the Huntington Library Quarterly, ELH, ELR, Modernist Cultures, Renaissance Quarterly, Literature and Theology and many other academic and popular publications. He is a regular contributor to the Times Literary Supplement. He currently lives in Phoenix AZ, Philadelphia PA, and Istanbul, Turkey.\nHawkes' monographs are: Idols of the Marketplace: Idolatry and Commodity Fetishism in English Literature, 1580-1680 (Palgrave 2001), Ideology (Routledge 2003), The Faust Myth: Religion and the Rise of Representation (Palgrave 2007), John Milton: A Hero of Our Time (Counterpoint 2010), The Culture of Usury in Renaissance England (Palgrave 2011), Shakespeare and Economic Criticism (Bloomsbury 2015), and The Reign of Anti-logos: Performativity in Postmodernity (Palgrave 2020). He has edited John Milton's Paradise Lost (Barnes and Noble 2004), John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (Barnes and Noble 2005) and The Book of Nature and Humanity (Brepols, 2013).\nIn 2002 a lengthy correspondence in The Nation followed Hawkes' critical review essay on Stephen J. Gould's final book. In 2012 a special issue of the journal Early Modern Culture was devoted to a discussion of his anti-materialist literary theory. In 2013 his 20,000-word article on Recent Studies in the English Renaissance for the journal Studies in English Literature angered critics with remarks on the contemporary economy that many found irrelevant to the topic. Hawkes' work generally explores the connections between economics, literature and philosophy from an anti-capitalist perspective. His later work specifically addresses the performative, cultural and ethical connections between usury and non-procreative sexuality or 'sodomy.'", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard", "response": ["* Lyotard was quoted as having privately said, in a conversation with David Hawkes, that \"capital is the enemy\".Hawkes, David, 'A \"Cultural Marxist\" Critique of Logos Rising', Culture Wars Magazine, May 2020"]}, {"page": "Heil Honey I'm Home!", "response": ["Television historian Marian Calabro described it as \"perhaps the world's most tasteless situation comedy\".Zap! A Brief History of Television, Marian Calabro, Four Winds Press, 1992, (p. 150).  However, some commentators also point out the crassness was intentional, and an element of the parody - among these is David Hawkes, professor of English, who cites Heil Honey, I'm Home! as a \"heavy-handed concept\", and argues that the show was a failure as a comedy because it \"disastrously exceeded\" the limits of irony.David Hawkes, \"British Contemporary Comedy\", in Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide, edited by Maurice Charney.
