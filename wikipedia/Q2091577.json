A major addition in 1949 was the twin cylinder Model 7, known as the Norton Dominator, a pushrod 500\u00a0cc twin-cylinder machine designed by Bert Hopwood. Its chassis was derived from the ES2 single, with telescopic front and plunger rear suspension, and an updated version of the gearbox known as the \"lay-down\" box. More shapely mudguards and tanks completed the more modern styling to Nortons new premium model twin.", "Also during this period Norton developed a family of three similar smaller-capacity twin cylinder machines: first the Norton Jubilee 250 and then the Navigator 350 and the Electra 400, which had an electric starter. These models were Norton's first use of unit construction. The engine was an entirely new design by Bert Hopwood and the frame and running gear were from the Francis-Barnett range, also owned by AMC. These machines had a reputation for poor reliability."]}, {"page": "Matchless", "response": ["In 1960 Bert Hopwood resigned from AMC and joined Triumph.

The Trident's three-cylinder design  was developed from Triumph's 1959 5TA unit-construction 500\u00a0cc parallel-twin (which had origins in Edward Turner's 1937 Triumph Speed Twin). The Trident has an extra cylinder and, following Triumph practice, its OHV pushrod engine has separate camshafts for the inlet and exhaust valves.Bacon, 1995. p.108. Although the prototype was ready by 1965, the factory delayed for years for a cosmetic redesign which meant that its eventual introduction was overshadowed by the apparently more modern Honda CB750, introduced in 1969.", "US BSA vice-president Don Brown felt that the BSA/Triumph triples needed a different look to succeed in the US. He commissioned designer Craig Vetter to redesign the BSA A75 (making it sleeker and better balanced) and disclosed the Vetter project to Peter Thornton (president of BSA/Triumph North America). In October 1969, Vetter displayed his customised A75. The bike was then sent to the UK, where it received a lukewarm reception from chief designer Bert Hopwood (but a favourable public reaction); the Vetter BSA Rocket3 became the Triumph X-75 Hurricane.", "The best-known bike was a production-class Trident prepared by a team led by Les Williams called Slippery Sam, a roadster prepared for production-class road racing to controlled specifications using selected adaptations only, available from the factory as part-numbered inventory. Williams' team won consecutive 750\u00a0cc production races at the Isle of Man TT for the five years between 1971 and 1975, and in the new F750 event for race-specification machines, Triumph and BSA machines with Rob North frames placed first and second.IoM TT official site, 1971 overview Retrieved 7 March 2015 Bert Hopwood recommended a production version of the racing triple, producing  at 8,250\u00a0rpm, but his suggestion was not adopted.

The 350\u00a0cc continued as before. Spring plunger frames were most commonly used, along with a standard B type rigid option for trials competition use. In 1950 both received larger 8\" front brakes. In late 1951 the 500 gained a new barrel and Bert Hopwood design head with separate rocker box, and the 350 had a new barrel and head of that design the following year  The earlier  connecting rod was shortened by , which with other improvements gave a useful increase in power. This engine redesign initially used sand-cast heads and barrels, still designated as ZB.

(In this new position Turner received a 5% commission on the company's net profits, and became a shareholder with 4.9% of the equity). The first thing he did was clear space on the production floor for an office and an adjoining drawing office.  Val Page had left Triumph four months before and joined BSA.  Bert Hopwood came to Triumph as Turner's Design Assistant. Ted Crabtree, who was also at Ariel before, became Chief Buyer, and Freddie Clarke was made Chief Development Engineer: both were motorcycle racers.", "In 1942, Turner designed a generator, using an all-alloy Triumph vertical twin engine, for the Air Ministry. After a heated disagreement with Jack Sangster, Turner quit his position at Triumph and promptly became chief designer at BSA, where he worked on a side-valve vertical twin for the War. Bert Hopwood was made Triumph's new designer and Sangster put him to work on a 500\u00a0cc side-valve twin competing for the same contract.", "By 1943 Bert Hopwood completed the design, but it was never produced. Triumph's prototypes were released in February, before BSA's planned launch. The design later became the post-war TRW model. In late October, Turner went back to Triumph. Hopwood had been working on a design for a 700\u00a0cc inline four-cylinder engine that could produce 50\u00a0bhp, but Turner's return to Triumph put an end to that plan.", "Ernie Lyons won the first Manx Grand Prix on a Tiger 100 built by Freddie Clarke using an alloy wartime generator engine and the unreleased sprung hub in 1946. Turner, away in America, and anti-racing, was furious when he heard, but threw Lyons a victory dinner anyway, and a small batch of replica T100 were made for sale. Clarke resigned and joined AMC as Chief Development Engineer.  Bert Hopwood had an argument with Turner over racing, left Triumph, and stayed away for 14 years.", "By 1961 Turner was under pressure to retire. Bert Hopwood resigned from AMC, and accepted Turner's offer to work for Triumph as Director and General Manager. It was at this time that Hopwood conceived the idea of a three-cylinder bike and engineer Doug Hele completed the drawings.

In the lineup was an ohc 350\u00a0cc twin with twin carburettors and five-speed transmission, designed by Turner (already retired) as his last project, and further refined by Bert Hopwood and Doug Hele. It was to be sold as both the Triumph Bandit and BSA Fury, each distinguished by minor cosmetic changes and paint schemes, with 34\u00a0bhp and capable of 110\u00a0mph.

Motor Cycle's Technical Editor Vic Willoughby concluded his 1967 interview with Hele's confirmation that \"...a high-performance seven-fifty parallel twin is not exactly at the top of the desirability stakes\", and the triples were developed into the most successful race bikes of their time, dominating the 750cc races in Europe and the US.
