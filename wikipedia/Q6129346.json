He immigrated to Canada in 1952. His lifelong interest in food and writing and his increased knowledge in these areas naturally led him to become a cookbook author. Following his retirement, he spent his remaining years on his farm in British Columbia's Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island. An energetic and passionate man with a large personality, Barber strove to empower others to do things for themselves.\nBarber was married twice and fathered five children; 3 sons and 2 daughters. Perhaps fittingly, Barber died peacefully on 29 November 2007, at his farm of natural causes while sitting at the dining room table reading a cookbook with a pot of chicken soup simmering on the stove. He was 84 years old and is survived by his wife and five children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 29", "response": ["*2007 \u2013 James Barber, Canadian chef and author (b. 1923)"]}, {"page": "1923 in Canada", "response": ["*March 23 - James Barber, cookbook author and television chef (d. 2007)"]}, {"page": "Charles de Lint", "response": ["Among dozens of public appearances, on October 9, 2007, de Lint was one of the guests who appeared as part of the Bolen Books Fall Series (with Jack Whyte (Oct. 13), Will Ferguson (Oct. 16) and James Barber (Oct. 20)).
