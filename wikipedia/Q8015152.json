Their family name may have inspired the character of Richard Marshall in the 1968 film Witchfinder General, which is set in that area during the English Civil War.\nHis younger brothers John and James Garth were both MPs for Leeds. The fourth brother, Henry Cowper, was Mayor of Leeds in 1842\u20131843. Marshall's daughter, Elizabeth Margaret, was the mother of the diplomat, Sir Cecil Spring Rice.", "link_mentions": {}}}
