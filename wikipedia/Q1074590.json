This led to an emergence of acts that, while influenced by or initially started out making grime, were moving into a more commercialised, hip-hop influenced form of music. Artists from this new wave included N-Dubz, Tinchy Stryder, Tinie Tempah, and Chipmunk (later known as Chip) who emerged in the late 2000s to great commercial success. Tinchy Stryder scored two number ones with songs \"Number 1\" and \"Never Leave You\" and became the best-selling British solo artist of 2009. The following year continued the success of the previous, with acts like Professor Green and Tinie Tempah breaking through to even bigger commercial success and also critical appreciation. The debut album from Tinie Tempah called Disc-Overy went to number one in the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum on 1 March 2011. He also won a Brit Award for his number one single \"Pass Out\". Rapper Plan B found success with his 2010 Hip Hop and Soul fusion album The Defamation of Strickland Banks, followed by the soundtrack album Ill Manors in 2012, both of which peaked at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart. In 2014, Scottish alternative hip-hop trio Young Fathers won the Mercury Music Prize for their album Dead. The album entered the UK chart at 35 after they won the award.

Instead, acts such as Tinchy Stryder, Tinie Tempah, N-Dubz and Chip were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility.

Record labels, radio, and the media struggled with knowing what to do with grime, and as a result limited its impact and exposure. The rise of dubstep and UK funky also made it harder for grime to gain a limelight. Many grime MCs also began to move towards commercial electro house-influenced rap and away from grime music. Artists such as Tinchy Stryder, Chip, and Wiley began to shift away from grime music and instead began releasing music with pop elements to much success. Wiley's track \"Wearing My Rolex\", produced by Bless Beats, has been credited for kickstarting this wave of commercialisation, but while it managed to gain a number 2 spot in the official singles chart, many of the initial attempts to replicate this success failed. Tinchy Stryder's \"Stryderman\" only managed to peak of No. 73, while Roll Deep's \"Do Me Wrong\" failed to chart at all. Skepta's \"Rolex Sweep\" only peaked at number 86, although it did briefly start a dance craze after it was released, received a remix by the band Coldplay, and featured on the comedy show Misfits.

On November 15, 2012, B.o.B released his ninth mixtape, entitled Fuck 'Em We Ball. The mixtape features guest appearances from T.I., Juicy J, Mac Miller, Playboy Tre, Snoop Lion, Spodee and Iggy Azalea, with much of the production coming from B.o.B himself. The mixtape also spawned a single, with the release of the club banger, \"We Still in This Bitch\". In early December, B.o.B revealed to MTV plans to release a rock music-influenced extended play: \"I've been holding back so much rock for so long. I have been performing with my band for a while, so I guess this is a real good canvas for me to paint on. No one's really expecting anything so I can do what I want to do.\" He also spoke lightly on his third studio album as well: \"My album is basically a continuation of The Adventures of Bobby Ray and Strange Clouds. I feel like it kinda bridges the gap between where all my fans are and finally getting everybody up to speed on what my sound is and exactly where I'm going.\""]}]}}
