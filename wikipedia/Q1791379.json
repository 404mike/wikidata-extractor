She trained at the Stedman Ballet Academy and learned from accomplished dancers including Anna Pavlova and Enrico Cecchetti.\nBorn in Wanstead as Hilda Tansley Munnings, the daughter of Frederick Tansley Munnings and the widowed Emma Catherine Gaulton (n\u00e9e Such), she began her career at the Savoy Theatre in London in 1910 and then joined the company of Mikhail Mordkin for a tour of the United States and the Koslov company for a tour of Europe.\nShe joined Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1913 to become the company's first English ballerina. She was the principal character dancer of the company until it disbanded in 1929. Sokolova's most famous role was that of the Chosen Maiden in L\u00e9onide Massine's reworking of The Rite of Spring (1920). She won approbation for \"what is generally agreed to be the longest and most exhausting solo in the history of theatrical dance\". Other notable performances include La Boutique fantasque (1919), The Three-Cornered Hat (1919), Les matelots (1925) and Le Bal (1929).\nAfter the Ballets Russes disbanded, Sokolova returned to England to teach, coach, work on choreography and occasionally perform. Her last performance was in 1962 when she danced in the Covent Garden Royal Ballet performance of Massine's The Good-humoured Ladies.\nIn 1945, Henry Gibbs dedicated to Sokolova his book Affectionately Yours Fanny:  Fanny Kemble and the Theatre (Jarrolds Publishers, London, 1945); she had helped him trace \"authoritative material\" (author's note, p. 8).\nSokolova wrote an autobiographical work on her years with the Ballets Russes titled Dancing for Diaghilev (John Murray, London, 1960).\nSokolova had one daughter, Natasha Kremnev (1917\u20131968), by her first husband Nikolai Kremnev (married 1917).  She subsequently married Leon Woizikovsky, a long-time dancer at Ballets Russes.  When she died on 5 February 1974, in Sevenoaks, Kent, England, she was survived by her third husband Ronnie Mahon.", "link_mentions": {}}}
