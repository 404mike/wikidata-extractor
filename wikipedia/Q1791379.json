She trained at the Stedman Ballet Academy and learned from accomplished dancers including Anna Pavlova and Enrico Cecchetti.\nBorn in Wanstead as Hilda Tansley Munnings, the daughter of Frederick Tansley Munnings and the widowed Emma Catherine Gaulton (n\u00e9e Such), she began her career at the Savoy Theatre in London in 1910 and then joined the company of Mikhail Mordkin for a tour of the United States and the Koslov company for a tour of Europe.\nShe joined Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1913 to become the company's first English ballerina. She was the principal character dancer of the company until it disbanded in 1929. Sokolova's most famous role was that of the Chosen Maiden in L\u00e9onide Massine's reworking of The Rite of Spring (1920). She won approbation for \"what is generally agreed to be the longest and most exhausting solo in the history of theatrical dance\". Other notable performances include La Boutique fantasque (1919), The Three-Cornered Hat (1919), Les matelots (1925) and Le Bal (1929).\nAfter the Ballets Russes disbanded, Sokolova returned to England to teach, coach, work on choreography and occasionally perform. Her last performance was in 1962 when she danced in the Covent Garden Royal Ballet performance of Massine's The Good-humoured Ladies.\nIn 1945, Henry Gibbs dedicated to Sokolova his book Affectionately Yours Fanny:  Fanny Kemble and the Theatre (Jarrolds Publishers, London, 1945); she had helped him trace \"authoritative material\" (author's note, p. 8).\nSokolova wrote an autobiographical work on her years with the Ballets Russes titled Dancing for Diaghilev (John Murray, London, 1960).\nSokolova had one daughter, Natasha Kremnev (1917\u20131968), by her first husband Nikolai Kremnev (married 1917).  She subsequently married Leon Woizikovsky, a long-time dancer at Ballets Russes.  When she died on 5 February 1974, in Sevenoaks, Kent, England, she was survived by her third husband Ronnie Mahon.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sergei Diaghilev", "response": ["Diaghilev was known as a hard, demanding, even frightening taskmaster. Ninette de Valois, no shrinking violet, said she was too afraid to ever look him in the face. George Balanchine said he carried around a cane during rehearsals, and banged it angrily when he was displeased. Other dancers said he would shoot them down with one look, or a cold comment. On the other hand, he was capable of great kindness, and when stranded with his bankrupt company in Spain during the 1914\u201318 war, gave his last bit of cash to Lydia Sokolova to buy medical care for her daughter. Alicia Markova was very young when she joined the Ballets Russes and would later say that she had called Diaghilev \"Sergypops\" and he had said he would take care of her like a daughter.", "Dancers such as Alicia Markova, Tamara Karsavina, Serge Lifar, and Lydia Sokolova remembered Diaghilev fondly, as a stern but kind father-figure who put the needs of his dancers and company above his own. He lived from paycheck to paycheck to finance his company, and though he spent considerable amounts of money on a splendid collection of rare books at the end of his life, many people noticed that his impeccably cut suits had frayed cuffs and trouser-ends.

Diaghilev negotiated his release in 1916 for a tour in the United States, but the dancer's mental health steadily declined and he took no further part in professional ballet after 1917. In 1920, when Diaghilev decided to revive The Rite, he found that no one now remembered the choreography.Buckle, p. 366 After spending most of the war years in Switzerland, and becoming a permanent exile from his homeland after the 1917 Russian Revolution, Stravinsky resumed his partnership with Diaghilev when the war ended. In December 1920 Ernest Ansermet conducted a new production in Paris, choreographed by L\u00e9onide Massine, with the Nicholas Roerich designs retained; the lead dancer was Lydia Sokolova. In his memoirs, Stravinsky is equivocal about the Massine production; the young choreographer, he writes, showed \"unquestionable talent\", but there was something \"forced and artificial\" in his choreography, which lacked the necessary organic relationship with the music.Stravinsky 1962, pp. 92\u201393 Sokolova, in her later account, recalled some of the tensions surrounding the production, with Stravinsky, \"wearing an expression that would have frightened a hundred Chosen Virgins, pranc[ing] up and down the centre aisle\" while Ansermet rehearsed the orchestra.Hill, pp. 86\u201389"]}, {"page": "Bronislava Nijinska", "response": ["\"She was a very strong dancer, and danced very athletically for a lady, and had a big jump,\" commented Frederic Franklin, a dancer and ballet master. \"She had incredible endurance, and seemed never to be tired,\" recalled Anatole Vilzak, who was a principal dancer in many of her mature choreographies.Baer (1986), pp. 74-77: Vilzak for Ballets Russes, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Ida Rubinstein.
