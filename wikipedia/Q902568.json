The designer recalled the time he took the singer to the Paris Opera dressed in one of his tuxedos: \"People screamed and hollered. It was an outrage\".

Likewise, she told Vanity Fair in 2018: \"My songs had little interest compared to the Anglo-Saxon production. So I took it to heart to dress well every time I went to London or New York.

Hardy's fashion choices, such as her white Courr\u00e8ges pantsuits and Yves Saint Laurent's first Le Smoking, are distinctly '60s and streamlined, yet they also have an edge.\" In addition to high-fashion ensembles, Hardy was known for her pared-down style, with discreet hairdos and makeup, and often wearing a simple sweater and pants combination. Her signature look was defined by her famous bangs and use of white boots by Courr\u00e8ges and miniskirts, considered one of the first people to wear the latter.
