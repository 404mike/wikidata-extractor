He worked in the 1950s for the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, before returning to Britain where he initially worked as a stage manager on outside broadcasts.   He then became an announcer on the Home Service, moving to work on television in 1963. He became part of the team of regular BBC newsreaders, the others being Robert Dougall, Michael Aspel and Richard Baker.   After leaving BBC Television  in 1967, he presented Look East, and, as a freelance broadcaster, contributed to the Today programme.  He also chaired editions of Any Questions? and Any Answers?.Corbet Woodall appeared in many television series, and also in some films, in which he invariably acted as either a television newsreader, or as an announcer.    On television, Corbet Woodall appeared in several episodes of The Goodies, as well as Steptoe and Son, A Fine Romance and Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, among others. Increasingly disabled by rheumatoid arthritis from the late 1960s, Woodall's frequent appearances on The Goodies (1970-1981) would have been more frequent, but according to author Robert Ross in his book The Goodies Rule OK his contract was often marked \"Artist ill\". In an interview with Ross, Tim Brooke-Taylor praised Woodall's professionalism in wake of his debilitating illness. \"He wasn't a well man at all, but (on camera) he rose from the dead and delivered every time.\"\nTowards the end of his life, Woodall became a committed supporter of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council (now Arthritis Research UK) and by appearing in a Christmas television appeal for the charity in 1981, raised the sum of \u00a372,000; at that time a record for an appeal of that kind. Woodall recounted his struggle with the illness in his autobiography Disjointed Life, which he hoped would help medical professionals to understand the mental and emotional aspects of the condition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Aspel", "response": ["Aspel worked as a drainpipe-layer and gardener, and sold advertising space for the Western Mail newspaper in Cardiff.

The new mixture instantly knocks the drinker unconscious, as proven by its test subject Bill who goes into a three-day sleep. After Windcheater and the Board of Directors try the new formula, they too are instantly put into a long-term sleep for being a bit too hasty. Soon after, Bill starts sleepwalking and leaves the office. Tim must chase Bill as he sleepwalks, while Graeme sets to work on an antidote. Upon finishing it, Graeme plans to test it by drinking some of the new improved Snooze but falls asleep before being able to drink the antidote. Tim, who is still chasing Bill, catches up with him. However, when Tim gets Bill to sleepwalk back to the office, he notices Graeme is now sleepwalking. Tim manages to get them both back to the office, where he then gives them the antidote and they wake up. They check the news, but as a result of Snooze being shipped out to the entire country, the newsreader (Corbet Woodall) has fallen asleep on his desk. Graeme says that the effect will be lessened if they add the antidote to every reservoir in the country."]}, {"page": "The Goodies and the Beanstalk", "response": ["*Corbet Woodall - the newsreader"]}, {"page": "Don't Just Lie There, Say Something!", "response": ["* Corbet Woodall as TV newsreader"]}, {"page": "List of The Goodies guest stars", "response": ["|Corbet Woodall (as himself) ||||| \"Snooze\" \u2014 \"The Music Lovers\" \u2014 \"Kitten Kong\" \u2014 \"The Goodies and the Beanstalk\" \u2014 \"Clown Virus\" \u2014 \"Lighthouse Keeping Loonies\" \u2014 \"Goodies and Politics\" \u2014 \"Pollution\" \u2014 \"The End\" \u2014 \"Hype Pressure\" \u2014 \"The Goodies Rule \u2013 O.K.?\""]}, {"page": "Corbett Woodall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Corbet Woodall"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British journalists", "response": ["Corbet Woodallnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Woodall", "response": ["*Corbet Woodall (1929\u20131982), British newsreader for the BBC"]}, {"page": "Corbet Woodall (gas engineer)", "response": ["Sir Corbet Woodall (27 August 1841 \u2013 17 May 1916) was an English gas engineer.
