They received neither pay nor special training during peacetime, though matrons underwent seven days of training in a military hospital bi-annually. By March 1909, enough nurses for 15 hospitals in England and Scotland had volunteered. Opposition from the Army Nursing Board, Sydney Holland (Chairman of the London Hospital) and senior London nurses delayed the establishment of the TFNS in the capital until the middle of March. On the 15th, 400 nurses were recruited as a result of a public meeting attended by many well-known speakers, including Elizabeth Haldane (vice-chairwoman of the Territorial Nursing Council and sister of Richard), Isla Stewart (Matron at St Bartholomew's Hospital) and Sir Alfred Keogh (Director General Army Medical Services). This was enough to establish two hospitals: No.1 (City of London) General Hospital, to be staffed exclusively by nurses from St Bartholomew's Hospital; and No.2 (City of London) General Hospital, to be staffed by nurses from the London Hospital and Guy's Hospital. Also in 1909, the TFNS was augmented by the affiliation of the Red Cross-organised Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADs). By January 1911, some 3,000 nurses had enrolled in the TFNS, and the next year the VADs numbered some 26,000 members.Beckett 2011 p. 221 In 1913, TFNS nurses were given permission to volunteer for overseas service."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Isla Stewart, became the matron of St Bartholomew's Hospital and founded the Royal British Nurses Association"]}, {"page": "Isla stewart", "response": ["#REDIRECT Isla Stewart"]}, {"page": "Susan Villiers (nurse)", "response": ["Susan Alice Villiers, born on 6 September 1863 in Edmonton, Middlesex, was the daughter of Mary Ann (n\u00e9e Sharp) and John Fitzpatrick Villiers, a barrister, and had a private education. Her middle-class family with nine children was not wealthy, especially after her father died when she was eleven years old. In 1892 she began three years of training at St Bartholomew's Hospital (Barts), London, and worked there as a staff nurse for a year after she qualified, until March 1896.Margaret R. Currie, \u2018Villiers, Susan Alice (1863\u20131945)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 The matron at Barts was Isla Stewart who was known to believe that the best possible post-qualification training for matrons was working with the Metropolitan Asylums Board (MAB), which ran institutions catering for the sick poor of London, including isolation hospitals. This may have encouraged Villiers to embark on a career with a series of MAB fever hospitals. She was one of the first generation of nurses to have the opportunity to train under a matron who was fully trained herself."]}, {"page": "Mary Snell Rundle", "response": ["Mary Snell Rundle was born in Saltash, Cornwall, in 1874. After her fianc\u00e9, a naval officer, died, Rundle decided to become a nurse. She moved to London to undertake her nursing training at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where she was the first recipient of the Isla Stewart Scholarship. This funded a year of training in New York, which she took at Teacher's College, Columbia, in hospital economics and teaching in American nursing schools. She gained a certificate in massage therapy."]}]}}
