He was born and grew up in Farnham, Surrey, the son of Ellen n\u00e9e Smith (1829\u20131890) and Francis Sturt (1822\u20131884).\nHe attended Farnham Grammar School and for a short period aged 15 years he was a pupil-teacher there, at one time having the ambition to be a sub-inspector of local schools. When his father died in 1884 he took over the administration of the family wheelwright business founded in 1706. During this time he also contributed as an assistant to the various craftsmen working in the business.However, the work became either too onerous or he found his preference would be to spend more time writing so he took on a partner Eventually that partner died and his own ill health became a problem in 1916, so another partner was found who bought him out in 1920.He wrote numerous books and articles under the name George Bourne, including a novel - his first published book - A Year's Exile (1898), which dealt with country life among the people of Surrey. Many of Sturt's later books, essays, and articles concerned the dealings of country people and their life and often included details of the practices and tools of the wheelwright and farmer. Among such books were The Bettesworth Book (1901), Change in the Village (1912), Lucy Bettesworth (1913), A Farmer's Life, with a Memoir of the Farmer's Sister (1922), and The Wheelwright's Shop (1923), often considered to be his best book.
