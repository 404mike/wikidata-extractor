British historian Laurence Rees described Ribbentrop as \"the Nazi almost all the other leading Nazis hated\".Rees, p. 243. Joseph Goebbels expressed a common view when he confided to his diary that \"Von Ribbentrop bought his name, he married his money and he swindled his way into office\".Snyder, p. 295. Ribbentrop was among the few who could meet with Hitler at any time without an appointment, however, unlike Goebbels or G\u00f6ring.", "Ribbentrop's negotiating style, a mix of bullying bluster and icy coldness coupled with lengthy monologues praising Hitler, alienated many.Bloch, pp. 116\u2013117. The American historian Gordon A. Craig once observed that of all the voluminous memoir literature of the diplomatic scene of 1930s Europe, there are only two positive references to Ribbentrop.Craig, p. 419. Of the two references, General Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg, the German military attach\u00e9 in London, commented that Ribbentrop had been a brave soldier in World War I, and the wife of the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Elisabetta Cerruti, called Ribbentrop \"one of the most diverting of the Nazis\". In both cases, the praise was limited, with Cerruti going on to write that only in the Third Reich was it possible for someone as superficial as Ribbentrop to rise to be a minister of foreign affairs, and Geyr von Schweppenburg called Ribbentrop an absolute disaster as ambassador in London.Craig, pp. 419\u2013420. The British historian/television producer Laurence Rees noted for his 1997 series The Nazis: A Warning from History that every single person interviewed for the series who knew Ribbentrop expressed a passionate hatred for him. One German diplomat, Herbert Richter, called Ribbentrop \"lazy and worthless\", while another, Manfred von Schr\u00f6der, was quoted as saying Ribbentrop was \"vain and ambitious\". Rees concluded, \"No other Nazi was so hated by his colleagues\"."]}, {"page": "Wannsee Conference", "response": ["The Wannsee Conference lasted only about ninety minutes. The enormous importance which has been attached to the conference by post-war writers was not evident to most of its participants at the time. Heydrich did not call the meeting to make fundamental new decisions on the Jewish question. Massive killings of Jews in the conquered territories in the Soviet Union and Poland were ongoing, and a new extermination camp was already under construction at Belzec at the time of the conference; other extermination camps were in the planning stages. The decision to exterminate the Jews had already been made, and Heydrich, as Himmler's emissary, held the meeting to ensure the cooperation of the various departments in conducting the deportations. Observations from historian Laurence Rees support Longerich's position that the decision over the fate of the Jews was determined before the conference; Rees notes that the Wannsee Conference was really a meeting of \"second-level functionaries\", and stresses that neither Himmler, Goebbels, nor Hitler were present. According to Longerich, a primary goal of the meeting was to emphasise that once the deportations had been completed, the fate of the deportees became an internal matter of the SS, totally outside the purview of any other agency. A secondary goal was to determine the scope of the deportations and arrive at definitions of who was Jewish and who was Mischling. \"The representatives of the ministerial bureaucracy had made it plain that they had no concerns about the principle of deportation per se. This was indeed the crucial result of the meeting and the main reason why Heydrich had detailed minutes prepared and widely circulated\", said Longerich. Their presence at the meeting also ensured that all those present were accomplices and accessories to the murders that were about to be undertaken."]}, {"page": "Bank for International Settlements", "response": ["* , Timewatch, Paul Elston, producer Laurence Rees, narrator Sean Barrett (UK), BBC, 1998 (a video documentary about the BIS role in financing Nazi Germany)"]}, {"page": "Nanjing Massacre", "response": ["* Horror in the East (2000),IMDb: Horror in the East  a documentary film produced by Laurence Rees for BBC, an examination of atrocities and depredations committed by Imperial Japanese military forces, from 1931 to 1945.

Richard J. Evans wrote that his views on these subjects have often been called \"social Darwinist\", but that there is little agreement among historians as to what this term may mean.Richard J.

Hitler also identified himself as a Christian in Mein Kampf. However, historians, including Ian Kershaw and Laurence Rees, characterize his acceptance of the term \"positive Christianity\" and his involvement in religious policy as being driven by opportunism, and a pragmatic recognition of the political importance of the Christian churches in Germany. Nevertheless, efforts by the regime to impose a Nazified \"positive Christianity\" on a state-controlled German Evangelical Church essentially failed, and it resulted in the formation of the dissident Confessing Church which saw great danger to Germany from the \"new religion\". The Catholic Church also denounced the creed's \"blood and soil\" ideology in the 1937 papal encyclical Mit brennender Sorge.", "In Mein Kampf, Hitler reassured his readers that both Christian denominations (Catholicism and Protestantism) were valid bases for the German people, provided the churches did not intervene in state affairs.

There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church\".Laurence Rees; The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler; Ebury Press; 2012; p. 135. Considering the religious allusions found in Mein Kampf, Rees writes that \"the most coherent reading of Mein Kampf\" is that Hitler was prepared to believe in an initial creator God, but did \"not accept the conventional Christian vision of heaven and hell, nor the survival of an individual 'soul'.\"Laurence Rees; The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler; Ebury Press; 2012; p. 135", "Laurence Rees described the thrust of the work as \"bleak nihilism\" revealing a cold universe with no moral structure other than the fight between different people for supremacy: \"What's missing from Mein Kampf\", wrote Rees\"and this is a fact that has not received the acknowledgement it shouldis any emphasis on Christianity\"though Germany, Rees noted, had been Christian for a thousand years.

Hitler had called his book \"derivative, pastiche, illogical rubbish!\"The Face of the Third Reich, Joachim Fest, p. 255 But in January 1934, Hitler appointed Rosenberg as the cultural and educational leader of the Reich \u2013 the official Nazi philosopher and ideologist. Rosenberg was notoriously anti-Christian.Richard Bonney; Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936\u20131939; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ; pp. 122 Church officials were perturbed by Hitler's appointment of Rosenberg as Nazi philosopher as it apparently endorsed Rosenberg's anti-church and neo-pagan philosophy. The Vatican banned The Myth of the Twentieth Century in February, 1934.Gill, 1994, see Chronology During the War, Rosenberg outlined the future he envisioned for religion in Germany. Among its articles: the National Reich Church of Germany was to claim exclusive control over all churches; publication of the Bible was to cease; crucifixes, Bibles and saints were to be removed from altars; and Mein Kampf was to be placed on altars as \"to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book\"; and the Christian Cross was to be removed from all churches and replaced with the swastika. But Rosenberg was, in the end, a marginalised figure in the Hitler regime.The Face of the Third Reich, Joachim Fest, pp. 247\u2013264", "Laurence Rees in contrast, notes that there is little emphasis on Christianity in Mein Kampf, which presents a view of the universe conspicuously at odds with traditional Christian notions long established in Germany. Hitler's vision is ordered instead around principles of struggle between weak and strong. Rees argues that Hitler's \"bleak and violent vision\" and visceral hatred of the Jews had been influenced by sources outside the Christian tradition. The notion of life as struggle Hitler drew from Social Darwinism, the notion of the superiority of the \"Aryan race\" he drew from Arthur de Gobineau's The Inequality of the Human Races; from events following Russia's surrender in World War One when Germany seized agricultural lands in the East he formed the idea of colonising the Soviet Union; and from Alfred Rosenberg he took the idea of a link between Judaism and Bolshevism, writes Rees.Laurence Rees; The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler; Ebury Press. 2012; pp. 61\u201362"]}, {"page": "Solihull", "response": ["*Laurence Rees (b. 1957), historian and documentary filmmaker, attended Solihull School"]}]}}
