He was born in Bombay (now Mumbai).\nStewart played Second XI cricket for Warwickshire in 1966, but then moved to Worcestershire. He made his first-class debut for Scotland against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in June 1969, scoring 51 and 6 in a thrilling four-run Scottish victory. He also played for Scotland against Surrey later that year, then in 1970 played his first two first-class games for Worcestershire.\nStewart played eight first-class matches in 1971, the most of any single season in his career, although he averaged only 18. His 1972 and 1973 summers were similarly unconvincing, although he did make a match-winning 62 in a List A game against Glamorgan late in 1972 and a first-class career-best 69 against the New Zealanders in April of the following year.\nHe left Worcestershire after the 1973 season, and played exclusively for Scotland for the remainder of his career, captaining the side against Ireland in Clontarf, and hitting 53 and 10 in a victorious Scottish performance. His final first-class appearance was in the same fixture at Dublin two years later, though on this occasion he scored only 0 and 11, and Scotland lost by seven wickets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Stewart", "response": ["David Stewart may refer to:", "*David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn (1357\u2013c. 1386), Scottish magnate", "*David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay (1378\u20131402), heir to the throne of Scotland", "*David Stewart (bishop) (died 1476), Bishop of Moray", "*David Stewart, Earl of Moray (c. 1455\u20131457), son of King James II of Scotland", "*David Stewart (RAF officer) (1890\u20131924), World War I flying ace", "*David Stewart (Scottish politician) (born 1956), Scottish politician", "*David Stewart (Maryland politician) (1800\u20131858), U.S. Senator from Maryland", "*J.
