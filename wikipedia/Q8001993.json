As a child, Bentley learned several musical instruments, and while still in his teens was a staple on the Melbourne cabaret circuit as a comedian and singer, his act consisting of playing a few bars of music deliberately badly, interspersed with jokes and legitimate musical numbers. He made his first appearance on ABC Radio in the early 1930s and by 1938 had become a fairly prominent personality, notably on Wilfrid Thomas's show Out of the Bag. In that year he moved to London, and worked for the BBC. Newly married to Petronella \"Peta\" Curra, with the war raging in England, he returned to Australia, and during the years of World War II, he spent entertaining the troops in the Pacific theatre."]}, {"page": "Rose, Rose, I Love You", "response": ["\"Rose, Rose, I Love You\" () is a 1940 Mandarin popular song composed by Chen Gexin and first recorded by Yao Lee. An English-language version whose lyrics have little in common with the original Mandarin was first recorded by Frankie Laine in 1951. The song was brought back to England by broadcaster Wilfrid Thomas in 1951 after doing commentary on the war in Malaya. When he played it on his BBC program he received a barrage of requests for a repeat and he played it again in several more programs. The song is also known under the titles \"Shanghai Rose\" and \"China Rose.\"", "The English-language lyrics were written by the British radio presenter Wilfrid Thomas. It was recorded by American singer Frankie Laine and the Norman Luboff Choir, with Paul Weston and his orchestra, on 6 April 1951, and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39367. The song reached number 3 on the Billboard music chart. At this time Columbia also released Yao Lee's original Mandarin version in the US and UK under the English title, \"Rose, Rose, I Love You.\" When the songwriter Chen Gexin's youngest son went to the United States for advanced education, he was able to meet Laine and maintained a correspondence. The English lyrics have little in common with the original Mandarin, but they pay subtle tribute to the titular Mandarin phrase \"m\u00e9igui m\u00e9igui\" (lit. rose, rose) by including the similar-sounding English phrase \"make way\" with its normal English meaning three times."]}, {"page": "Order of the Star in the East", "response": ["* In the first seven-and-a-half minutes of this interview, published in a 29-minute YouTube video by the J.
