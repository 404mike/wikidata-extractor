J. Kenney, was a British Latinist who served as the Kennedy Professor of Latin until his retirement in 1984. Specialising in transmission and textual criticism, he was considered a leading expert on the work of Ovid and Lucretius. He spent the majority of his career at Cambridge University, where he was an emeritus fellow of Peterhouse until his death in 2019.He was known for his exacting but constructive criticism.  When interviewing candidates for admittance to the college, he would assess them using the \"Fufu test\".  His pet cat Fufu would be on the candidate's chair and they would be judged by the manner in which they treated it.  The more kindly they treated the cat, the more likely they were to be admitted.", "link_mentions": []}}
