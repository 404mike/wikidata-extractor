She holds, or held, all three world and championship records relating to ironman-distance triathlon races: firstly, the overall world record, secondly, the Ironman World Championship course record (from 2009 until Mirinda Carfrae lowered it in 2013), and thirdly, the official world record for all Ironman-branded triathlon races over the full Ironman distance.\nShe won the World Championship in three consecutive years (2007\u20132009), but could not start the 2010 World Championship race because of illness, then \u2013 while suffering from injuries so severe that her former coach Brett Sutton said she should \"not even be on the start line\" \u2013 regained the title in 2011. She is the first British athlete to hold the Ironman Triathlon World Championship, and was undefeated in all thirteen of her races over the ironman distance. She is the only triathlete, male or female, to have won the World Championship less than a year after turning professional, an achievement described by the British Triathlon Federation as \"a remarkable feat, deemed to be a near impossible task for any athlete racing as a rookie at their first Ironman World Championships.\"She lowered the world record on all three occasions (2009\u20132011) she raced Challenge Roth (formerly Quelle Challenge Roth) at Roth in Bavaria, Germany. Her current record of 8 hours 18 minutes 13 seconds is more than 32 minutes faster than the record which stood from 1994 to 2008, when Yvonne van Vlerken broke it by just over 5 minutes. Following her 2010 world record, her former coach Brett Sutton described Wellington as \"a person of true international sporting excellence that is overshadowed by no one in any other sport.\"Paula Newby-Fraser's course record at the Ironman World Championships had stood for 17 years until Wellington broke it in 2009. At the time of her retirement, Wellington held the four fastest times ever recorded by a woman over the ironman distance, and had the greatest number of sub-9 hour times \u2013 nine, five more than Newby-Fraser's previous record. In addition to the Ironman titles, she was also the 2006 International Triathlon Union (ITU) Age Group World Champion and the 2008 ITU long-distance World Champion.\nBefore becoming a professional triathlete, Wellington worked for the British government as an adviser on international development and, for Rural Reconstruction Nepal, on development projects in Nepal. International development remains one of her passions. She is actively involved in supporting charities relating to international development and supporting and encouraging women and girls to take up sport.\nShe became, after meeting the parents of Jon Blais at her first world championship, an ambassador for the Blazeman Foundation, performing a \"Blazeman roll\" in his memory at the finish line of all her triathlon races since then. She campaigns for full equality of women in prize money, sponsorship, and media reporting of sport, and equal opportunities, notably in cycling, for women to be able to compete on the same terms, and over the same race distances, as men.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wellington (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Chrissie Wellington (born 1977), English triathlete"]}, {"page": "Ironman Triathlon", "response": ["* Chrissie Wellington", "|Chrissie Wellington", "|Chrissie Wellington"]}, {"page": "Cannondale", "response": ["In triathlon racing, Cannondale has sponsored 2005 Ironman world champion Faris Al-Sultan, Dejan Patr\u010devi\u0107, Croatian triathlon champion, as well as three time Ironman world champion Chrissie Wellington, Sarah Reinertsen, the first amputee woman to finish the Ironman Triathlon, 2004 Paralympics 200 IM gold medalist Rudy Garcia-Tolson."]}, {"page": "University of Birmingham", "response": ["Triathlete Chrissie Wellington and Rachel Joyce won the ITU Long Distance World Championship on 2008 and 2011, and Chrissie holds the four fastest times in the World Ironman competition.

He is known for his forthright views on training methods and strong criticism of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) and its officials.", "Sutton emphasises the supreme importance of mental attitude, especially in Ironman, where, as he told Chrissie Wellington, \"there are six times in every race where you enter a dark place of doubt and must have that passion to overcome.\" Examples of the importance of mental strength given by Sutton include: determination; the need to remain calm and composed when things go wrong; building on mistakes rather than dwelling on them; dealing positively with injury rather than fearing it; resting the mind as well as the body\u2014these are \"the makings of a great triathlete\", otherwise \"success will always be elusive.\" When asked the three most important components for Ironman, Sutton replied, \"Consistency, strength and self discipline.\"", "Sutton has an authoritarian coaching style, in which the athlete is expected to trust the coach completely, and to follow instructions without question. At the start of her trial period with Sutton, he told Chrissie Wellington that she needed to \"switch off\" her mind and \"follow orders and not question everything\"\u2014something she found very difficult to do.", "He is sceptical of gadgets such as power meters and heart rate monitors, and prefers instead to draw on his experience as a swim coach and as a trainer of greyhounds and racehorses. Greg Bennett, whom Sutton coached in the late 1990s and who become an Olympian and double World Cup winner, said, \"He has learned how to read animals that are fatigued\", a skill which, Bennett says, enables Sutton to push athletes to the limit, but not over it. Sutton regards interval training as a very important part of his programmes, saying, \"If it's not long, it's got to be hard.\" He is infamous for his \"black days\", such as \"Black Wednesday\"s, when he requires a seemingly endless succession of hard intervals, or of other very hard sessions. The value of these sessions lies, in Chrissie Wellington's view, in psychological toughening.", "Sutton has a reputation for being hard on his athletes, and was described as being \"infamous for his tough training sessions.\" Sutton says that his training depends on the individual athlete, and that he spends most of his time slowing his athletes down, giving as examples Chrissie Wellington and James Cunnama, who trains less under Sutton than in his \"first 5 years in the wilderness\". On the other hand, Hillary Biscay once ran 65\u00a0km as a training run under Sutton, but Sutton said, \"I saw her in 3 years get her dream. I saw her win an Ironman, I saw her get on a great deal of podiums and I saw her beat some great athletes whose talent dwarfed hers. It is about the individual and their needs.\"", "Athletes can shorten their careers, believes Sutton, by trying to break records in Ironman races. He said, \"I've seen plenty of people bust themselves and have bad seasons because they're chasing records.\" and \"This sport is the ultimate tough test, each race hurts your body so much at the top level.\" Referring to Chrissie Wellington's world record in Roth, her subsequent withdrawal from the 2010 world championships in Kona, and M-dot world record six weeks later, he commented, \"To drive it to the edge of oblivion when you have a 20-minute lead is complete negligence. It has cost her dearly last season, but there we were busting it again for the triathlon fraternity by the end of the season.\" He added, \"Ironman is not a 200\u00a0m freestyle swim event, it is a body shattering nine hours. We have always treated it with respect. When you have the win you shut it down and work on recovery for the next battle. We both agree to disagree and that is what I most like about Chrissie. We could discuss everything and no recriminations after, it's one of her many strengths.\"", "In response to criticism, Chrissie Wellington wrote that she did her \"due diligence\" before her trial week in January 2007 with Sutton's squad. She stated that \"child abuse is a serious crime and one which personally revolts me to the core of my being. And I speak from experience\", and said that her decision about Sutton was \"based on evidence I gathered, both from Brett and from other athletes who were present at the time the incident took place. I did this, and also spoke at length to the rest of the team about his past. This coupled with my own gut feeling about Brett as a man and as a coach led me to accept the offer of a place on the team.\""]}, {"page": "Yvonne van Vlerken", "response": ["On 13 July 2008, van Vlerken set a then new world record of 8:45:48 for Ironman-distance races at the Quelle Challenge Roth, more than five minutes faster than Paula Newby-Fraser's world record time of 8:50:53, which had stood for 14 years. The race took place in wet and cold conditions with non-stop rain and wind. Yvonne van Vlerken broke the old record with the then second-fastest female Ironman-distance marathon time of 2:54:22.
