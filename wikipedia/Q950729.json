He spent the 2006\u201307 season with third-tier side Morton, where he won the Second Division title and received individual accolades. Having made only two appearances following his return to Celtic, he spent the second half of the 2008\u201309 season with Hamilton Academical in the SPL.\nHe moved on loan to another SPL side, St Mirren, for the 2010\u201311 season, after which Celtic released him from his contract and he signed with St Mirren permanently. In December 2011 he won the SPL player of the month award, and won the Scottish League Cup with the club in 2013.\nHe joined Dundee in June 2014 and has been a key player for the side throughout his tenure there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Airdrie, North Lanarkshire", "response": ["*Paul McGowan"]}, {"page": "Dundee F.C.", "response": ["Paul Hartley was quick in the transfer window for the following season, bringing in no fewer than twelve new players, to rebuild the squad for top-flight football, having already signed Greg Stewart on a pre-contract from Cowdenbeath and Philip Roberts who joined before the end of May.
