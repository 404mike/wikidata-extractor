In 1999 he was selected for the Carlton Screenwriters course.  This led to his writing the anthology tribute Inspector Morse: Rest In Peace, and to his first television episode commissions.  As a lead writer on the soap opera Family Affairs, he wrote the UK's first ever interactive soap episodes.\nLindsey directed Michael Palin in the short How to Use Your Coconuts for the DVD of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  With BreakThru Films, he wrote and directed the short film The Clap starring Steve Furst which was a finalist in Turner Classic Movies Classic Shorts 2005.\nFor BreakThru Films' Magic Piano, Lindsey wrote the screenplay, and selected and arranged the musical score performed by Lang Lang.  He also directed Lang Lang and Heather Graham in the live action segments of the feature-length The Flying Machine.\nLindsey is also a pronunciation coach and gives workshops on contemporary English pronunciation, at University College London and internationally.  He was interviewed on intonation as the studio guest of Stephen Fry on the BBC radio series Fry's English Delight.  He has argued that the phonetic transcriptions for Received Pronunciation used in dictionaries are outdated as the upper-class accent of the 20th century has died out.  He has proposed a replacement transcription system for a more modern form of British English.Lindsey previously worked as a lecturer in phonetics at University College London. He has an MA from UCL and an MA and PhD from University of California Los Angeles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Received Pronunciation", "response": ["The linguist Geoff Lindsey has argued that the system of transcription for RP has become outdated and has proposed a new system as a replacement."]}, {"page": "Open front unrounded vowel", "response": ["The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) that represents this sound is , and in the IPA vowel chart it is positioned at the lower-left corner.
