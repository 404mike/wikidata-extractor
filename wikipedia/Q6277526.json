With an impressive record over Hartlepool United in previous encounters, The Owls built on this fact and scored on the thirty-third minute through Reda Johnson, whose goal turned out to be the winning goal with the game finishing 0\u20131. The next two games were the biggest of the season so far, with Wednesday facing rivals Chesterfield at home, and then there was the Steel City derby against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Going into the Chesterfield game Wednesday were without Liam Palmer who had been called up to the Scotland U-21 side, and defender Reda Johnson being called up to the Benin national football team. With Johnson scoring the winning goal in the previous game and being named in the team of the week, Wednesday would have to deal without him. Wednesday did go onto win the game comfortably in a 3\u20131 win, with goals from Lewis Buxton, Gary Madine, and loanee Ben Marshall, with former Sheffield Wednesday player Leon Clarke getting a consolation goal just before Wednesday's third. The win took The Owls into the automatic-promotion position of second. In the build-up to the biggest game of the season so far, the Steel City derby against Sheffield United, Wednesday had some good news with top scorer Gary Madine winning The Football League Young Player of the Month award for September. The highly anticipated first Steel City derby of the season was at Bramall Lane in front of over 28,000 fans, and an over a further 11,000 watched the game at Hillsborough Stadium on three large television screens. Wednesday started the game well, and was neutrally supported to have been unlucky to find themselves behind, but at half-time The Owls had not taken their chances and The Blades had taken their two, with Stephen Quinn and Ched Evans finding the net to make it 2\u20130. The second half was more of an even contest, but The Owls still seemed to be making more chances. Finally, their well and truly deserved goals came twice in four minutes with ten minutes of the game left to play, Chris O'Grady and Gary Madine both scored with headers. Captain Rob Jones nearly grabbed an amazing win in the final minutes but his header was straight at goalkeeper Steve Simonsen. The game finished 2\u20132, and although Megson felt 'over the course of the game' Wednesday deserved to win, although it was the Wednesday fans who went home the happier. The week after Wednesday's amazing comeback saw David McGoldrick go back to Nottingham Forest after spending one-month on loan, scoring one goal and making four appearances. Also, youngster Nathan Modest left the club by mutual consent on 18 October, after making four appearances in 2008 for the club, and unable to break into the side since, he later signed for local club Sheffield F.C. The Owls built on the Steel City derby result as they won Colchester United 2\u20130 the next weekend. Goals from captain Rob Jones and Reda Johnson in the second half won the game at Hillsborough. Tuesday 25 October saw Wednesday travel to Carlisle United. Unfortunately for The Owls they ended up dropping points and went two points behind second-place Huddersfield Town after losing 3\u20132. Impressive loanee Ben Marshall scored against his former club to open the game, before Carlisle United scored three in the second-half, with goals from Lee Miller, Rory Loy, and Liam Noble. To make matters worse, top scorer Gary Madine gained his second bookable offence and got sent-off, but still pushing to somehow get back in the game Rob Jones scored his second in two games, but it was not enough for Sheffield Wednesday. Wednesday were away again in the league at the weekend, this time against Wycombe Wanderers. Vice-captain Jose Semedo scored his first goal for the club to put The Owls in the lead. However, the lead just lasted six-minutes when a wonderful solo dribble and shot saw Jordon Ibe score. Jordon Ibe became the youngest ever player to score for Wycombe Wanderers at just an amazing 15 years and 244 days old on his first-start for the club. Another, first goal for a club came when Ryan Lowe scored to put Wednesday back in the lead, after recently coming back from injury. The goal was enough to seal a 2\u20131 victory for The Owls. The last piece of news in October was that Wednesday were drawn away in Round 1 to Morecambe in the 2011-12 FA Cup, with the game due to be played on the weekend of 12 November."]}, {"page": "Roberto Firmino", "response": ["Firmino made his Liverpool debut in a pre-season friendly away to Swindon Town on 2 August, and his league debut a week later, replacing Jordon Ibe for the final 12 minutes of a 1\u20130 win at Stoke City.

Left-back Tyler Blackett was substituted after only 24 minutes, after the second goal went in, Robinson's half-time departure with concussion weakened an already porous defence, Packwood's neat finish into his own goal gave Wednesday a third, and Huws' hip injury left Birmingham with ten men for the last few minutes.Tattum, Colin (21 March 2014). \"Blues: Emyr on the mend and Robbo is okay\". Birmingham Mail. Retrieved 10 April 2014. An improved showing at home to Reading still resulted in defeat. Huws lasted only half an hour before aggravating his injury, Reading scored on the break, and Caddis equalised from the penalty spot after Reilly, who had begun the match at left back rather than his usual central midfield, was fouled. In the second half, Macheda headed against the crossbar, \u017digi\u0107, Ibe and Burke drew saves or last-ditch blocks, and \u017digi\u0107's far-post header was disallowed because the corner was judged to have curved out of play, but Reading scored after 82 minutes, again on the break, and that one counted.Tattum, Colin (24 March 2014). \"Birmingham City 1\u20132 Reading\". Birmingham Mail. Retrieved 23 April 2014. The traditionally high-scoring visit to fellow strugglers Millwall did not disappoint. Jordon Ibe's first Birmingham goal was equalised when Steve Morison's shot went in off Robinson, but Shinnie's header from Blackett's cross regained the lead before half-time. Millwall were denied a penalty when Robinson appeared to handle, and \u017digi\u0107 headed home Burke's cross soon afterwards. Millwall's all-out attack at the end produced a penalty for a foul by Aaron Martin, but Birmingham held on.
