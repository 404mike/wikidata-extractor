Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett was fond of using a Zippo lighter as a slide, but this was largely for special effects.

Clapton and Whitlock considered adding the Delaney & Bonnie horn section to their new band, but this plan was abandoned. Whitlock later explained the ethos of Derek and the Dominos: \"we didn't want any horns, we didn't want no chicks, we wanted a rock 'n' roll band.

Biographer Harry Shapiro points out that \"Purple Haze\" is most likely \"a pot-pourri of ideas\" which Hendrix developed over time.  As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting.  Hendrix read Night of Light, a 1966 novel by Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer, that expanded on a short story published in 1957.  In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a \"purplish haze\" which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants.  An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled \"Purple Haze \u2013 Jesus Saves\", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted.  In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, \"I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.\"  He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song:"]}, {"page": "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs", "response": ["Atco Records issued Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs in November 1970 in the United States, with a UK release following in December, on Polydor. The album failed to chart in the United Kingdom, while in the US, it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Top LPs chart. Despite this achievement, Layla was viewed as a commercial failure, according to authors Harry Shapiro and Jan Reid.Reid, pp. xvii, 145. Dowd later rued the difficulty of getting airplay for the songs on US radio,Santoro, p. 69. while Shapiro attributes its lack of success in Britain to minimal promotion by Polydor and what he terms \"the unrelenting and monotonous Press litany of a post-Cream withdrawal syndrome\".Shapiro, pp. 123, 126. Concerned that the press and the public were unaware of Clapton's involvement, Atco and Polydor distributed badges reading \"Derek is Eric\"."]}, {"page": "Are You Experienced", "response": ["According to Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro, the music on Are You Experienced incorporates a variety of music genres from rhythm and blues to free jazz; author Peter Doggett noted its \"wide variety of styles\", while journalist Chris Welch said \"each track has a different personality\".: \"wide variety of styles\"; : \"each track has a different personality to it\"; : \"Are You Experienced contains a wide range of material\"; : \"the music ranges across all the genres of popular music, from R&B to free jazz\". Musicologist Gilbert Chase asserted that the album \"marked a high peak in hard rock\", and music critic Jim DeRogatis characterized the LP and its preceding singles as \"raw, focused psychedelic rock\".For a high peak in hard rock see: ; for \"raw, focused psychedelic rock\" see:  A contemporary review published in Newsweek in October 1967 identified the influence of soul music on the Experience and the album. In 1989, Hit Parader magazine ranked it number 35 in a list of the top 100 heavy metal albums. In 2006, writer and archivist Reuben Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote: \"it's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&B, blues\u00a0... musical tradition. It altered the syntax of the music\u00a0... in a way I compare to, say, James Joyce's Ulysses.\"", "Although the lyrics to \"Purple Haze\", which opened the US edition of Are You Experienced, are often misinterpreted as describing an acid trip, Hendrix explained: \"[It] was all about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.\": \"about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea\"; : often misinterpreted as describing drug use. He speculated that the dream may have been inspired by a science fiction story about a purple death ray. Redding stated that Hendrix had not yet taken LSD at the time of the song's writing, which was after a gig in London on December 26, 1966.: \"Purple Haze\" was written after a gig in London on December 26, 1966; : Hendrix had not yet taken LSD. The first draft of the lyrics was exceedingly long, so Chandler and Hendrix reduced its length to something appropriate for mainstream pop music. It opens with a guitar/bass harmony in the interval of a tritone that was known as the diabolus in musica during the time of the Spanish Inquisition. The Catholic Church prohibited medieval composers of religious music from using the tritone, or flattened fifth, because as musicologist Dave Whitehill wrote: \"to play it was like ringing Satan's doorbell.\" In the opinion of the author Ritchie Unterberger, the opening riff has \"become a permanent part of rock's vocabulary.\" Whereas Rolling Stone described the song as the beginning of late-1960s psychedelia, the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek identified Hendrix's use of R&B, funk, and soul elements in the track.: : the beginning of late-60s psychedelia."]}, {"page": "Little Wing", "response": ["Jimi Hendrix began his career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and performed and recorded with several popular R&B artists, including the Isley Brothers, Don Covay, and Little Richard. He learned from other R&B guitarists, including Curtis Mayfield, who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording.  Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963.  He described the experience: \"The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions.  Curtis was a really good guitarist\u00a0... I learned a lot in that short time.  He probably influenced me more than anyone I'd ever played with up to that time, that sweet sound of his, you know\".  In 1966, Hendrix recorded a song titled \"(My Girl) She's a Fox\" with the Icemen, an R&B duo. Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro has described it as \"paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield, [that] is virtually a blueprint for 'Little Wing'\".  Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to \"She's a Fox\" (included on the 2010 West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology) \"perhaps the strongest of his pre-Experience career.  Hendrix's Curtis Mayfield-influenced guitar styling is the song's strongest attribute\"."]}, {"page": "Band of Gypsys", "response": ["The mix of improvisation and R&B/funk elements is evident in \"Who Knows\", which was the opening number for the second (after the brief \"Auld Lang Syne\") and third shows. It is a loose jam rather than a structured song and during the performance for second show Hendrix teases the audience with \"I hope you don't mind us jamming a little bit, we're just messing around\u00a0... seeing what we're gonna play next\".  Built on Hendrix's guitar figure, \"Who Knows\" is framed by Cox's economical funk-blues bass line and Miles' steady drum beat, which Murray describes as \"a thick, lazy twitch\".  Hendrix explores guitar phrases using different tones and effects between vocal sections.  According to Cox, Hendrix used a new combination of effects for the first time.  These included a Uni-Vibe phase shifter, an Octavia harmonizer (developed for him by Roger Mayer during the recording of his first album), a Fuzz Face distortion box, and a wah-wah pedal.  One mixture of them produces a \"whistling, shimmering, ring-modulated tone so rich with upper harmonics\" in the higher range, while in the lower range \"it almost sounds like 'Froggy Went a-Courtin\u00a0... all these [lower] oct[ave]-intervals give it such a dramatic effect\".  His use of the wah-wah employs \"rapid foot movement and wide sweeps [which] tend to make the melody fade in and out\".  Also, by using a triplet rhythm with the pedal, a polyrhythm with the prevailing 4/4 beat is created.  The lyrics, some which borrow from other R&B songs, are also improvised and show considerable differences between the two renditions.  As it unfolds, there is an R&B-style vocal call and response section between Hendrix and Miles, then separate vocal sections for each, which Miles follows with scat singing.  During the middle section, most of the instrumentation drops out and returns with more Hendrix guitar tonal explorations before winding down at 8:23 (second show) and 9:32 (third show).  While McDermott feels that the jam is underdeveloped and biographer Harry Shapiro criticizes Miles' vocals, Shadwick and writer David Henderson focus on the \"easy groove\" and \"lilting flow\".  Besides adding a fresh rhythmic element to his music, it also gives Hendrix more room to experiment with different approaches and sounds on guitar."]}, {"page": "Foxy Lady", "response": ["  Prior to the recording, the group had not worked out an ending for the song and bassist Noel Redding claimed that using the last IV chord was his idea.  Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro suggests that song's lyrics were inspired by Heather Taylor, who later married Roger Daltrey of the Who. Hendrix later commented that he did not approach women in such a straightforward manner as the lyrics suggested. Lithofayne \"Faye\" Pridgon, Hendrix's girlfriend in the mid 1960s, has also been suggested as the inspiration for the song."]}, {"page": "Bobby Whitlock", "response": ["His next solo album was One of a Kind, co-produced with Bill Halverson and released in 1975 on Capricorn Records.
