Fawlty Towers became a huge success in almost all countries in which it aired. Although it initially was a flop in Spain, largely because of the portrayal of the Spanish waiter Manuel, it was successfully resold with the Manuel character's nationality changed to Italian except in Spain's Catalan region where Manuel was Mexican. To show how badly it translated, Clive James picked up a clip containing Manuel's \"\u00bfQu\u00e9?\" phrase to show on Clive James on Television in 1982.

Hilary Rubinstein, who accepted Lucky Jim for Victor Gollancz, commented, \"I doubted whether Jim Dixon would have gone to the pub and drunk ten pints of beer.... I didn't know Kingsley very well, you see.\"Quoted in Bradford, Chapter 5.

For \"many years\" Amis imposed a rigorous daily schedule on himself, segregating writing and drink.
