They ran a successful costume jewellery business through the 1980s; however, the stock market crash of 1987 ended it in almost complete bankruptcy. Don made his television debut in 1989 as a regular on This Morning, which led to further presenting work across the decade, including his own shows for BBC Television and Channel 4. Don began his writing career at this time and published his first of over 25 books, in 1990. Between 1994 and 2006, Don wrote a weekly gardening column in The Observer.\nIn 2003 Don replaced Alan Titchmarsh as the lead presenter of Gardeners' World, only leaving the show between 2008 and 2011 due to illness. Since then he has written and produced several garden series of his own; the most recent being Monty Don's Adriatic Gardens which began broadcast in January 2022.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gardening", "response": ["Monty Don has speculated on an atavistic connection between present-day gardeners and pre-modern peasantry."]}, {"page": "University Challenge", "response": ["|Television (Monty Don, Martha Kearney, Andrew Neil, Clare Balding)"]}, {"page": "Magdalene College, Cambridge", "response": ["File:Monty Don Left.jpg|Monty Don, television presenter and writer"]}, {"page": "Richard Jefferies", "response": ["*Mike Pringle, Wild Life, A Unique Vision of Our World (with a foreward by Monty Don and Victorian contextual information by Liz Howell), Swindon: Richard Jefferies Museum Trust, 2021).
