He studied the smallpipes with Old William Lamshaw, of Morpeth, and later with Joseph Turnbull, of Alnwick.\nHis playing was highly regarded in his lifetime: Thomas Bewick, the engraver, who also lived and worked in Newcastle, wrote  Some time before the American War broke out, there had been a lack of musical performers upon our streets, and in this interval, I used to engage John Peacock, our inimitable performer, to play on the Northumberland or Small-pipes; and with his old tunes, his lilts, his pauses, and his variations, I was always excessively pleased. William Green, piper to the Duke of Northumberland from 1806, considered him  the best small pipes player he ever heard in his life.\nHe is also closely associated with the first printed collection of music for smallpipes, A Favorite Collection of Tunes with Variations Adapted for the Northumberland Small Pipes, Violin, or Flute, published by William Wright, of Newcastle, probably in 1801. The book had an engraved title page in the style of Thomas Bewick, and probably from his workshop, and the 1801 date is suggested by entries in the account books of Bewick for work done for Wright, between February and June 1801; in any case, Wright gave the address of his shop as High Bridge, so the date of publication definitely preceded the move of the business from High Bridge to Pilgrim Street, which he announced in April and May 1803.\nAs well as containing 50 tunes for smallpipes, the book also contains an engraving, also thought to have been done in Bewick's workshop, showing 2 chanters and their fingering charts; one is a simple keyless chanter with an octave range from G to g, the other is J. Peacock's New Invented Pipe Chanter with the addition of Four Keys, these keys were for the notes low D, E, F sharp, and high a. \nPeacock was thus probably the first player of the instrument to play an extended keyed chanter. Such chanters continued to be developed in the first decades of the 19th century, by  John Dunn, in association with Peacock, and slightly later by Robert Reid, and subsequently by others, including Reid's son James.\nThomas Bewick encouraged Peacock to teach pupils to become  masters of this kind of music; one of these pupils was Bewick's own son, Robert Eliot Bewick.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Bewick", "response": ["Bewick was fond of the music of Northumberland, and of the Northumbrian smallpipes in particular.Uglow, 2006. pp. 121\u2013122.

Its policy aim was to encourage and stimulate 'the younger generation of pipers and beginners in pipe playing'. Billy Pigg, an influential piper, was a vice-president from 1930, while Tom Clough, known as the 'Prince of Pipers', accepted a vice-presidency in 1933.

The Society's regular meetings and annual competitions are currently held the Chantry Bagpipe Museum, in Morpeth. It also holds an annual concert in Morpeth. It publishes a quarterly newsletter and an annual magazine, as well as many important collections of pipe music, including, in 2000 The Clough Family of Newsham,The Clough Family of Newsham, , edited by Chris Ormston and Julia Say a detailed study of the music of Tom Clough and his family, and, in 1997, The Border Minstrel,Billy Pigg, The Border Minstrel, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2nd edition, 2 vols., C.

He was a tall man, more than six feet in height, and 'with a muscular development that entitled him to be classed among the forms gigantic', he cut an imposing figure. Despite his massive build, he was something of an athlete: 'and this welterweight could have been backed to any amount to run one hundred yards against any individual in the county'. The obituary states that he assisted in extending the compass of the Northumbrian smallpipes, until it was in some degree a new instrument. The two pipemakers most involved in this redesign were first John Dunn, and later Robert Reid; it would have made sense for Reid to work closely with an expert piper like Green, as Dunn had done earlier with John Peacock. It also states that he originated the 'new arrangement' of duet playing, so that with the aid of his nephew Robert Nicholson, or of his own son Tom, he achieved results of which the older instrument, with a single-octave compass, had been incapable.

Another important group of tunes have an attribution to Robert Reid, or his children James Reid and Elizabeth Oliver.

This version was known, from the Rook manuscript, but its association with the Reid family was not.
