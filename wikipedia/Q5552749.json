He played in 41 games in 1950\u201351, one game short of being an ever-present.Gazzard moved to Brentford in 1954, after sustaining a cartilage injury and losing his first team place to John Dick. He later returned to Penzance as an amateur.His two sons, Paul and Roger, also played for Penzance, and grandson Carl is a former county cricketer for Somerset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in September 2006", "response": ["*Gerry Gazzard, 81, English footballer."]}, {"page": "Carl Gazzard", "response": ["His grandfather, Gerry Gazzard was a footballer who played 126 games for West Ham United from 1949\u201350 to 1953\u201354."]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. players", "response": ["| Gerry Gazzard"]}, {"page": "Penzance A.F.C.", "response": ["*  Gerry Gazzard"]}, {"page": "Gazzard", "response": ["*Gerry Gazzard (1925\u20132006), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Six defeats and just one win from the opening 9 Second Division matches saw Tommy Lawton quit the club in favour of a \u00a310,000 move to Arsenal, a transfer which saw James Robertson arrive at Griffin Park in part-exchange. Full back Fred Monk took over as caretaker manager until the appointment of Bill Dodgin Sr. on 1 October 1953. Dodgin's arrival heralded three consecutive wins, which lifted the Bees out of the relegation places. Ineffective forwards Broome and McPherson were transferred out and replaced by Cardiff City's Johnny Rainford and Frank Dudley. Despite their arrivals, Brentford showed poor form over the Christmas and New Year period and a money-raising FA Cup run ended in a third round replay defeat to Hull City. Gerry Gazzard arrived on loan from West Ham United in January 1954 and despite Gazzard and Dudley forming something of a strike partnership during the final 10 weeks of the season, Brentford were relegated in 21st-place after the club's final match on 24 April.", "|Gerry Gazzard", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gerry Gazzard", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gerry Gazzard", "| Gerry Gazzard"]}]}}
