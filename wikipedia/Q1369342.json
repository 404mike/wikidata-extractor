The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the mischievous and impulsive Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as easy-going everyman Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as uptight and arrogant Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter C \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show, often becoming reluctantly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines.", "Initially, the only certain cast member for the show was Peter Sallis.

He frequently  clears his throat with a hacking sound. He disappears without explanation after series 5 (as actor Michael Bates had died) and is never mentioned again.", "The casting of the white actor Michael Bates as the Indian bearer Rangi Ram has been seen as an example of blackface. Jimmy Perry rejected the claim that Bates \"blacked-up\", saying all he \"wore was a light tan\", in the 2013 Daily Telegraph interview. A frequently recurring gag connected with Rangi Ram is his continual references to \"we British\" and \"us British\" while at the same time referring to the other Indian characters as \"ignorant coolies\" or \"damned natives\". Bates was born in India to English parents but had learned to speak Urdu, which he used during the show and had fought in the Burma Campaign giving him some insight into his characterisation.
