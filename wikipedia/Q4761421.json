Both the lead designer and executive producer of Shift 2 spoke out against GT5, implying that it has way too many cars. Andy Tudor, lead designer of the game, said that games like Gran Turismo 5 and Forza Motorsport 3, were more like encyclopedias than games, and featured hundreds of \"irrelevant cars\". Tudor said \"You can add hundreds of cars to your game, but people will ignore most of them.\"", "Lead designer, Andy Tudor said Shift 2: Unleashed is injecting \"emotional and social aspects\" into the sequel, which take it beyond \"being a numbers game\". \"The simulation genre, really, is just a numbers game at the moment; it's all about, 'We've got the greatest physics engine, and we're going to add 1,000 cars, tracks etcetera.' It's quite a dry experience. We want to turn that on its head, by adding in social features, such as Autolog. I've gone on record before saying GT5 and Forza are on pedestals at the moment: everyone believes they are the games to beat. They have great products, but they stop at being a numbers game, a mathematical simulation of great physics, whereas we go beyond that with the emotional and social aspects.\""]}]}}
