Though many Scottish clubs were watching his performances as a centre forward, he began his career as an apprentice with English club Blackpool but returned to Scotland to join Hibernian in 1987. After two years on the fringes he became an important part of the team under manager Alex Miller, who played McGinlay as a midfielder instead of a forward/winger. He was in the Hibs side that won the Scottish League Cup in 1991, and went on to make over 150 appearances in his first stint at Easter Road.In 1993, he was signed by Celtic, the club he supported as a child, for a fee of \u00a3525,000 after he impressed then boss Liam Brady. He made his debut on 7 August 1993 as a substitute in a 2\u20132 draw away to Motherwell. However, after just over fifteen months he was on the move again as he was not part of new manager Tommy Burns's plans, in spite of McGinlay being Celtic's top goalscorer in the previous season. With the cash raised from selling McGinlay, Burns bought Tosh McKinlay \u2013 one of McGinlay's old St Peters Boys teammates \u2013 from Hearts.\nMcGinlay rejoined Hibs for a fee of \u00a3420,000 on 1 November 1994. He remained at Easter Road for six seasons, experiencing a relegation followed by a promotion before moving to Ayr United. Whilst at Ayr, McGinlay enjoyed a cup run which ended with him being on the losing side in the 2002 Scottish League Cup Final. He made 74 appearances in all competitions for the Honest Men and scored 23 goals before retiring in 2005. He later operated a cleaning business in Cambuslang with his wife Margaret.McGinlay represented Scotland B once, in a 3\u20130 win against Northern Ireland B at his club ground Easter Road in 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2002 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|RM ||8 || Pat McGinlay"]}, {"page": "1991 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||11||Pat McGinlay"]}, {"page": "List of Celtic F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Pat McGinlay"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["| Pat McGinlay"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["As a club newly promoted to the SPL, Hibs entered at the second round stage of the competition, in which they defeated Clyde in a penalty shootout.

This left youngsters like Burns sidelined, and in 1999 he was signed by legendary Manager John Lambie (footballer, born 1941) for Partick Thistle on loan with a view to a permanent move. He made 6 appearances in an impressive spell, but chances of a permanent move were scuppered when Ayr demanded a transfer fee and he was recalled to Somerset Park."]}, {"page": "List of outfield association footballers who played in goal", "response": ["|Irvine had to take over for Theo Snelders, who was dismissed for violent conduct after conceding a penalty in an away fixture at Hibernian.
