Ramsay was a member of the Royal Commission on Endowed Schools in Scotland in 1872.

It continued in production throughout the 1970s and was closed in 1983,Diageo booklet, Special Releases, 2012 although supplies of its single malt whisky are still available. When Port Ellen was closed in 1983, Diageo did knock down some of the buildings, repurposed others, and destroyed the stills. The distillery houses a malting which continues to supply all Islay distilleries, as per an agreement signed in 1987. The dwindling stocks of Port Ellen whisky are owned by Diageo; due to the closing of the distillery, its whisky is a collectors item."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Ramsay"]}, {"page": "Stirling Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Ramsay "]}, {"page": "Falkirk Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|  John Ramsay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Ramsay", "| John Ramsay"]}, {"page": "John Ramsay", "response": ["John Ramsay may refer to:", "*John Ramsay (British Army officer) (1775\u20131842), General and Member of Parliament for Aberdeen Burghs, 1806\u20131807", "*John Ramsay (of Kildalton) (1814\u20131892), Member of Parliament for Stirling Burghs, 1868, and Falkirk Burghs, 1874\u20131886", "*John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie (1847\u20131887), Scottish politician, Member of Parliament for Liverpool, 1880", "*John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell (c. 1464\u20131513)", "*John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness (c. 1580\u20131626), Scottish nobleman", "*John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736\u20131814), Scottish writer", "*John Ramsay (businessman) (1841\u20131924), Scottish-born Australian businessman", "*John Ramsay (commissioner) (1862\u20131942), Chief Commissioner of Balochistan", "*John Ramsay (surgeon) (1872\u20131944), Australian surgeon", "*John Ramsay (magician) (1877\u20131962), Scottish magician", "*John Ramsay or Johnny Ramensky (1905\u20131972), Scottish criminal", "*John Ramsay (Australian footballer) (1930\u20131983), Australian rules footballer", "*John Ramsay (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131917), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1874 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Ramsay"]}, {"page": "Ramsay (surname)", "response": ["*John Ramsay (disambiguation), several people, including", ":*John Ramsay (British Army officer) (1775\u20131842), MP for Aberdeen Burghs, 1806\u20131807", ":*John Ramsay (of Kildalton) (1814\u20131892), MP for Stirling Burghs, 1868, and Falkirk Burghs, 1874\u20131886", ":*John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie (1847\u20131887), Scottish politician, MP for Liverpool, 1880", ":*John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell (c. 1464\u20131513)", ":*John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness (c. 1580\u20131626), Scottish nobleman", ":*John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736\u20131814), Scottish writer", ":*John Ramsay (businessman) (1841\u20131924), Scottish-born Australian businessman", ";*John Ramsay (commissioner) (1862\u20131942), Chief Commissioner of Balochistan", ":*John Ramsay (surgeon) (1872\u20131944), Australian surgeon", ":*John Ramsay (magician) (1877\u20131962), Scottish magician", ":*John Ramsay or Johnny Ramensky (1905\u20131972), Scottish criminal", ":*John Ramsay (Australian footballer) (1930\u20131983), Australian rules footballer", ":*John Ramsay (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131917), Scottish footballer", ":*John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness (c. 1580 \u2013 1626), Scottish courtier"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868\u20131885)", "response": ["|John Ramsay", "|John Ramsay"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1857\u20131868)", "response": ["|John Ramsay"]}, {"page": "Kildalton Castle", "response": ["Kildalton was designed in 1867 by John Burnet and built by 1870 for the Islay distiller and MP John Ramsay.
