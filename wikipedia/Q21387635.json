He was a pioneer in the study of lichens as \"environmental indicators, especially in atmospheric pollution\".Peter W. James grew up in Sutton Coldfield, which was then a rural suburb of Birmingham. He graduated with a B.Sc. in botany from the University of Liverpool. There he enrolled as a Ph.D. student with the intention of studying lichenology, but never completed his doctorate. In 1955 he started work as a lichen specialist at London's Natural History Museum. He spent his career there, became a deputy Keeper of Botany, and retired in 1990. In 1958 he was one of the founders of the British Lichen Society. From 1958 to 1977 he was the editor of the British Lichen Society's journal The Lichenologist.\nMany of Peter's publications are landmarks in the recent history of lichenology. Of his earlier works are his \"New checklist of British Lichens\" (1965) and his major contribution to Ursula Duncan's Introduction to British Lichens (1970) \u2013 both were a major stimulus to lichen taxonomy and field-studies in NW Europe. Other landmarks include, for example, his paper on cephalodia (with Aino Henssen, 1976), the preliminary prospectus of lichen communities in the British Isles (with David Hawksworth and Francis Rose, 1977), and the monographs on Nephroma (with Joy White, 1987, 1988).\nHe was a coeditor and senior contributor for editor-in-chief Ole William Purvis's Lichen Flora of Great Britain of Ireland (1992). James contributed to the sections on Agyrium, Degelia, Megalospora, and Megaspora.\nHis interests extended overseas to temperate South America as well as Australia, New Zealand and the Atlantic islands. He was a founder member, acting treasurer and first president of the International Association for Lichenology and co-ordinated its first field meeting in the Austrian Alps in 1971.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James (surname)", "response": ["*Peter Wilfred James (1930\u20132014), British botanist"]}, {"page": "Peter James", "response": ["*Peter Wilfred James (1930\u20132014), English botanist and lichenologist"]}, {"page": "Metus (fungus)", "response": ["Metus is a genus of three species of lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae.

W. Shimwell, an important study of lichen dynamics in managed heathland. After receiving his B.Sc. in 1970, Coppins became a graduate student at King's College London and studied lichen ecophysiology under the supervision of Francis Rose. Coppins changed the focus of his doctoral studies to the taxonomy of Micarea species found in Europe and became in 1974 an Ascomycete Taxonomist in the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE). He spent his career there, retiring in May 2009. He received his Ph.D. in 1982 from University College London. His dissertation, supervised jointly by Francis Rose and Peter Wilfred James, was published in 1983. The work was based upon examination of about 3500 lichen collections and involved field work not only in the British Isles but also in Denmark and Sweden. His field research has been mostly in Scotland but he has also collected lichens in \"Borneo, Chile, the Carpathians, Thailand, USA, Norway and Canada\". His preserved specimens in the RBGE's herbarium number about 25,000. His co-collectors include Ursula Katherine Duncan, David John Galloway, Peter W. James, and Francis Rose."]}, {"page": "Peter Crittenden", "response": ["Crittenden studied botany at the University of London, where he graduated in 1971. He spent two summer vacation studentships working under the supervision of Peter Wilfred James. For his PhD, he moved to Sheffield to study ecology under David Read, researching the effect of sulphur dioxide pollution on pasture grasses. Crittenden started working with lichens after moving to Canada as a research fellow at McMaster University. With his supervisor Ken Kershaw, he studied the role of lichens in the nitrogen cycle in boreal-arctic ecosystems. Much of his research involved determining nitrogenase activity in the mat-forming lichen Stereocaulon paschale. Crittenden eventually settled into a lectureship at the University of Nottingham in 1981, where he remains and is Leverhulme Emeritus Professor as of 2021."]}]}}
