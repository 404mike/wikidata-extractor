The Good, the Bad and the Ugly broke previous conventions on how the two had previously collaborated. Instead of scoring the film in the post-production stage, they decided to work on the themes together before shooting had started, this was so that the music helped inspire the film instead of the film inspiring the music. Leone even played the music on set and coordinated camera movements to match the music. The distinct vocals of Edda Dell'Orso can be heard permeating throughout the composition \"The Ecstasy of Gold\". The distinct sound of guitarist Bruno Battisti D\u2019Amorio can be heard on the compositions 'The Sundown' and 'Padre Ramirez'. Trumpet players Michele Lacerenza and Francesco Catania can be heard on 'The Trio'. The only song to have a lyric is 'The Story of a Soldier', the words of which were written by Tommie Connor. Morricone's distinctive original compositions, containing gunfire, whistling (by John O'Neill), and yodeling permeate the film. The main theme, resembling the howling of a coyote (which blends in with an actual coyote howl in the first shot after the opening credits), is a two-pitch melody that is a frequent motif, and is used for the three main characters. A different instrument was used for each: flute for Blondie, ocarina for Angel Eyes, and human voices for Tuco. The score complements the film's American Civil War setting, containing the mournful ballad, \"The Story of a Soldier\", which is sung by prisoners as Tuco is being tortured by Angel Eyes. The film's climax, a three-way Mexican standoff, begins with the melody of \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" and is followed by \"The Trio\" (which contains a musical allusion to Morricone's previous work on For a Few Dollars More)."]}, {"page": "John O'Neill", "response": ["John O'Neill may refer to:", "*John O'Neill (guitarist) (born 1957), Northern Irish guitarist of rock band The Undertones", "*John O'Neill (musician) (1926\u20131999), English musician", "*John O'Neill (Canadian politician) (1858\u20131922), Liberal politician in Ontario, Canada", "*John O'Neill (congressman) (1822\u20131905), U.S. Representative from Ohio", "*John O'Neill (Fenian) (1834\u20131878), member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (Fenians)", "*John O'Neill (Irish senator) (died 1941), Irish  Senator in 1925", "*John O'Neill (philosopher), political philosopher, Professor of Political Economy at the University of Manchester ", "*John O'Neill (political activist) (born 1946), fervent opponent of John Kerry and a leader of the groups Swift Vets and POWs for Truth", "*John O'Neill (Wisconsin politician) (1830\u2013?), Wisconsin State Assemblyman", "*John O'Neill, 1st Viscount O'Neill (1740\u20131798), Irish politician", "*John O'Neill, 3rd Viscount O'Neill (1780\u20131855), Irish Tory politician", "*John O'Neill (Australian rules footballer) (born 1935), Geelong player during the 1950s", "*John O'Neill (baseball), baseball player", "*John O'Neill (field hockey) (born 1968), American former field hockey player", "*John O'Neill (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u20132012), Republic of Ireland and Preston North End player", "*John O'Neill (footballer, born 1958), Northern Ireland player", "*John O'Neill (footballer, born 1974), Former Scottish football player with Queen of the South and former manager of Stirling Albion", "*John O'Neill (rugby league) (1943\u20131999), Australian rugby league footballer and coach", "*John O'Neill (Tipperary hurler) (born 1990), Irish hurler", "*John O'Neill, architect who oversaw the completion of St Peter's Cathedral, Belfast", "*John O'Neill (businessman) (born 1951), CEO of the Australian Rugby Union and former head of Football Federation Australia", "*John O'Neill (editor), founding editor of Black Gate magazine", "*John O'Neill (poet) (1777\u20131854), Irish shoemaker poet and playwright", "*John O'Neill (sociologist) (1933\u2013), Canadian sociologist", "*John O'Neill (VC) (1897\u20131942), Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross during the First World War", "*John O'Neill (video game designer) (born 1948), experimental art video game designer", "*John O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone (died 1641), the son of Hugh O'Neill", "*B.

The whistling on the record was, according to most sources, by John O'Neill, a trumpeter and singer with the Mike Sammes Singers who was known for his whistling skill, though other sources credit Noel Walker.  The song is noted for its false ending: after the last chorus, a male voice shouts \"Oi\" (on the album version) and \"Hey\" (on the single version), and the tune starts up again with the repeated chorus, then fades out."]}, {"page": "List of people who performed on Beatles recordings", "response": ["*John O'Neill\u2014vocalist; session musician and member of the Mike Sammes Singers.
