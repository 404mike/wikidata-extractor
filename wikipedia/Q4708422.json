Writing for Gramophone in 1969, Nigel Hunter found the songs to be \"of absorbing power and depth\", but complained of the electric guitar parts. Alasdair Clayre, in the same magazine, questioned whether the \"occasional guitar gobbling\" reflected Axelrod's genuine ideas or \"an obligatory concession to contemporary sound\", but he ultimately regarded Song of Innocence as a compelling record. In his opinion, the producer's impressions of Blake \"reveal a depth of imagination and skill warranting attention beyond the confines of pop music\", proving he could compose innovative pieces for a large orchestra, which Clayre felt comprised the best of California's studio musicians on the album. Billboard magazine called it \"an aesthetic mix of music and philosophy\u00a0... chock full of mysticism, creativity, and change\", believing that Axelrod's idyllic music would be interesting enough to impact the record charts."]}, {"page": "1974 in poetry", "response": ["* Alasdair Clayre, A Fire by the Sea"]}, {"page": "1984 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Alasdair Clayre, author, broadcaster, singer-songwriter and academic (born 1935)"]}, {"page": "Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind \u2013 Singles and Demos 1964 to 1967", "response": ["# \"Train Song\" (Vashti Bunyan, Alasdair Clayre, Jennifer Lewis)"]}, {"page": "A Cold Wind Blows", "response": ["*A Cold Wind Blows, a 1966 UK album and title track composed and sung by Cyril Tawney, Matt McGinn, Johnny Handle and Alasdair Clayre"]}, {"page": "Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre production history", "response": ["*Encore Brel! by Jacques Brel, English lyrics by Richard Ouzounian, Alasdair Clayre, Rod McKuen, and Paul Austen"]}, {"page": "Felicity Bryan", "response": ["She was married to the economist Alex Duncan of The Policy Practice and lived near Oxford.
