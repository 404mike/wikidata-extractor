Upon completing training, in 1917 he was posted to the Western Front where he was transferred again, to The East Yorkshire Regiment. During the German spring offensive of 1918 his unit, the 1/4th Battalion the East Yorkshires, was sent to reinforce the line at B\u00e9thune. \nThe Germans used infiltration tactics, where stormtroopers aimed to infiltrate weak points in defences, bypassing strongly held front line areas. Troops with heavier weapons would then attack the isolated strongpoints. Lawton, with troops from the Durham Light Infantry, did indeed become isolated in a forward trench during the assault; when they ran out of ammunition and food after three days' fighting, they surrendered. He was imprisoned at a prisoner of war camp at a fort in Lille and afterwards in Minden, Germany.\nAfter the war, he completed a Master's degree in French at the University of Wales in Bangor, and received a doctorate in Latin and French from the Sorbonne in 1926. He became a lecturer, then a Professor of French at the University College Southampton. He later took the position of Professor of French, and was promoted within the university administration as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Pro Vice-Chancellor, at the University of Sheffield. \nDuring World War II, he briefed behind the lines operatives and was listed in The Black Book of key people to be arrested upon a successful Nazi invasion of Britain.He published a Handbook of French Renaissance Dramatic Theory in 1950, and Poems, Selected with Introduction and Notes (on the work of Joachim du Bellay) in 1961.\nIn 1999, Lawton received the L\u00e9gion d'honneur of the French Republic, honouring his services in World War I.\nHe died on 24 December 2005. at the age of 106.", "link_mentions": {}}}
