On February 25, the Spaniards landed near Fort Charlotte. The outnumbered British garrison resisted stubbornly until Spanish bombardment breached the walls.  The garrison commander, Captain Elias Durnford, had waited in vain for relief from Pensacola, but was forced to surrender. Their capitulation secured the western shore of Mobile Bay and opened the way for Spanish operations against Pensacola."]}, {"page": "Gulf Coast campaign", "response": ["In early 1780 G\u00e1lvez embarked on an expedition to capture Mobile, which was one of only two major British military establishments left in West Florida, the other being the capital, Pensacola.  Assembling 750 men at New Orleans, he sailed for Mobile on 11 January, reaching Mobile Bay on 9 February after being delayed by storms. He was joined on 20 February by a supporting force of 450 from Havana, but did not begin siege operations until the 1 March. After 14 days of bombardment, Fort Charlotte's walls were breached, and its commander, Captain Elias Durnford, surrendered."]}, {"page": "History of Pensacola, Florida", "response": ["Following Great Britain's victory over both France and Spain in the Seven Years War (known in America as the French and Indian War), in 1763 the British took control of Pensacola under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763). During the period of British rule, the area began to prosper following establishment of the Panton, Leslie Company in 1785, which had a trading post attracting Creek people from southern Alabama and Georgia. The British designated Pensacola as the capital of British West Florida and developed the mainland area of fort San Carlos de Barrancas, building the Royal Navy Redoubt.  Surveyor and engineer Elias Durnford laid out the town in its current form, creating the Seville Square district. Working with Durnford was George Gauld, a British naval surveyor. He also painted several views of Pensacola during the British period."]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors of Florida", "response": ["|Captain-Lieutenant Elias Durnford"]}, {"page": "Montfort Browne", "response": ["Browne in 1768 led a successful expedition to the region of Natchez, bringing back a report of the fertility of the land and its lack of population, and suggesting that it be developed. For his services in the war he had been awarded  in the province, and he used the trip to stake out large parcels of land on the eastern banks of the Mississippi River, just north of present-day Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Irregularities in Browne's bookkeeping in 1768 drew criticism from his patron Hillsborough, and Browne formally requested that his books be audited when Johnstone's successor John Eliot arrived in April 1769. Unfortunately, Eliot committed suicide a month after his arrival, and Browne reluctantly retook the reins of power. He sent the provincial surveyor, Elias Durnford, to London in May 1769 to answer ongoing complaints that colonists were making against him, but Durnford returned that December with orders removing Browne from power and granting Durnford an acting governorship."]}, {"page": "Durnford", "response": ["* Elias Durnford, British Army officer"]}, {"page": "John Eliot (Royal Navy officer)", "response": ["Eliot was buried outside the Pensacola fort with military honours. The only major action begun during his brief time in office was to institute legal proceedings against Lieutenant Governor Browne on charges that he had misappropriated colonial funds.
