Frank Calderon (London 1865 \u2013 21 April 1943), was a British painter of portraits, landscapes, figure subjects and sporting pictures. He was the third son of the painter and Keeper of the Royal Academy in London, Philip Hermogenes Calderon and was married (in 1892) to Ethel Wells Armstead (b. 1864), third daughter of the noted sculptor Henry Hugh Armstead, RA.\nWhen fourteen, Calderon was awarded the Trevelyan Goodall Scholarship and later a scholarship to the Slade School under Professor Alphonse Legros. He and Charles Edward Johnson, a landscape artist, started the School of Animal Painting at 54 Baker Street, London in April 1895; Calderon acted as principal until 1916. Some of their students were Cecil Aldin, Lionel Edwards, Alfred Munnings, Lady Helena Gleichen, Frederic Whiting and George E. Studdy. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1881\u20131921, and had his first Royal Academy painting bought by Queen Victoria. His 1936 book Animal Painting and Anatomy is still considered a useful reference source. He illustrated numerous books such as \"The Most Delectable History of Reynard The Fox\" edited by Joseph Jacobs and published by Macmillan in 1895. The cover, designed by A. A. Turbayne, was gold-blocked in art nouveau style and inspired designers to create work using \"asymmetrical designs, sinuous curves, and simplified shapes with minimal shading.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cecil Aldin", "response": ["Born in Slough, Aldin was educated at Eastbourne College and Solihull Grammar School. Cecil Aldin's father, a builder, was a keen amateur artist so Cecil started drawing at a very young age. He studied art at the studio of Albert Joseph Moore in Kensington but, unhappy with the teaching methods Aldin left after a month to study animal anatomy at the National Art Training School in South Kensington. After this he attended a summer school run by the animal painter and teacher, William Frank Calderon at Midhurst, Sussex. Aldin left when he developed rheumatic fever but shortly afterwards he sold his first drawing, which appeared in The Building News of 12 September 1890. This was followed by a dog show picture purchased by The Graphic in 1891. He rented a studio in Chelsea and in 1892 he began a long association with The Illustrated London News. Whilst at Chelsea he would often draw in the London Zoological Gardens and an early work on a tiger in the zoo which was drawn from life was found to be a copyright of a photograph by Gambier Bolton. He also did some work for Cadbury's advertising. Aldin was commissioned by The Pall Mall Budget in 1894 to illustrate the serialisation of stories from Rudyard Kipling's The Second Jungle Book.

Butler like her friend Rose Barton, who also studied under Naftel, did not follow his choice of landscape, instead she devoted herself to cattle, birds, and flower gardens. She continued her studies at Westminster School of Art under William Frank Calderon who specialised in animal painting and later opened a school of animal painting.  At Frank Calderon's School she studied the subject of cows, and it was that work for which she was elected to the Old Society, the Royal Academy.()"]}, {"page": "W.

She also exhibited works in Germany, Italy and the United States. Her best known work is Companions of Labour, a bronze group of horses dating from 1926. For many years Askew lived at Newmarket in Suffolk and later, in the 1920s, at Berwick upon Tweed. From Berwick, she exhibited at a number of galleries in the north-east of England and Scotland but appears to have given up her artistic career to take up acting in the 1950s."]}, {"page": "Frank Calderon", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Frank Calderon"]}]}}
