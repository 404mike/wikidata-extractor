When responsible for the regular orchestral concerts at the Crystal Palace, he wrote a series of programme notes from which eventually grew his musical dictionary. His interest in the music of Franz Schubert, which was neglected in England at that point in the nineteenth century, led him and his friend Arthur Sullivan to go to Vienna in search of undiscovered Schubert manuscripts. Their researches led to their discovery of the lost score of Schubert's Rosamunde music, several of his symphonies and other music in 1867, leading to a revival of interest in Schubert's work.\nGrove was the first director of the Royal College of Music, from its foundation in 1883 until his retirement in 1894. He recruited leading musicians including Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford as members of the College faculty and established a close working relationship with London's older conservatoire, the Royal Academy of Music.\nIn addition to his musical work, Grove had a deep and scholarly knowledge of the Bible. He contributed to the English literature on the subject, including a concordance in 1854 and about a thousand pages of Sir William Smith's 1863 Bible Dictionary. He was a co-founder of the Palestine Exploration Fund.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 13", "response": ["*1820 \u2013 George Grove, English musicologist and historian (died 1900)"]}, {"page": "Syncopation", "response": ["(3)\tBy inserting silences (rests) at points where a listener might expect strong beats, in the words of George Grove, \"nine bars of discords given fortissimo on the weak beats of the bar\":"]}, {"page": "1900", "response": ["* May 28 \u2013 Sir George Grove, English music writer (b. 1820)"]}, {"page": "Don Pasquale", "response": ["* Chouquet, Gustave (1889). \"Ventadour, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\" in A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by George Grove, Vol. 4,  pp.\u00a0237\u2013238.

An important step towards the recovery of the neglected works was the journey to Vienna which the music historian George Grove and the composer Arthur Sullivan made in October 1867. The travellers unearthed the manuscripts of six of the symphonies, parts of the incidental music to Rosamunde, the Mass No. 1 in F major (D. 105), and the operas Des Teufels Lustschloss (D. 84), Fernardo (D. 220), Der vierj\u00e4hrige Posten (D. 190), and Die Freunde von Salamanka (D. 326), and several other unnamed works.

The former was well received at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, \"It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic.\" The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, \"The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [Stanford's] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation.\"\"Savonarola\", The Theatre, 1 August 1884, p. 79 The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden.

Love not at all \u2013 that I heard not a grain of. ... And I do think that there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely.\" In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had \"just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy.\"Willeby, pp. 293\u2013294", "In 1883, the Royal College of Music was set up to replace the short-lived and unsuccessful National Training School for Music (NTSM).Wright, David. \"The South Kensington Music Schools and the Development of the British Conservatoire in the Late Nineteenth Century\", Journal of the Royal Musical Association, Vol. 130, No. 2 (2005), pp. 236\u2013282  Neither the NTSM nor the longer-established Royal Academy of Music had provided adequate musical training for professional orchestral players, and the founder-director of the college, George Grove, was determined that the new institution should succeed in doing so. His two principal allies in this undertaking were the violinist Henry Holmes and Stanford. In a study of the founding of the college, David Wright notes that Stanford had two main reasons for supporting Grove's aim. The first was his belief that a capable college orchestra was essential to give students of composition the chance to experience the sound of their music. His second reason was the severe contrast between the competence of German orchestras and the performance of their British counterparts. He accepted Grove's offer of the posts of professor of composition and (with Holmes) conductor of the college orchestra.
