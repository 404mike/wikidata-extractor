In 1887, Lyne and WRU secretary Richard Mullock became the Welsh representatives to the International Board, the body set up to regulate the sport in Britain.Smith (1980), pg 50. Lyne served on the board of the IB, which later became the International Rugby Board, from 1887 to 1938. He was in demand as an administrator, and was known to be very fair-minded.Smith (1980), pg 51. He was also a progressive thinker, and voiced concerns about the North of England breaking away from the IRB years before the formation of rugby league. As the chair of the Welsh Football Union, he met with Neath secretary Walter E. Rees, with whom he later ran the WRU for near four decades. In 1892, Lyne was elected one of four vice-presidents of the WRU, with joint responsibilities for Cardiff and the East area. During the same meeting, Mullock, who was extremely unpopular with the Welsh rugby clubs, was replaced as secretary by William Gwynn.Smith (1980), pg 78."]}, {"page": "David Gwynn", "response": ["David 'Dai' Gwynn (28 December 1861\u00a0\u2013 8 March 1910) was a Welsh international rugby union wing who played club rugby for Swansea, and county rugby for Lancashire.

While Tom Williams of Neath complained that Mullock, as treasurer, had not provided a balance sheet for members since 1884. Gwynn called for Mullock to be replaced as Secretary by Walter E. Rees; but Rees withdrew after W.D. Phillips and Horace Lyne argued Mullock's case, reminding the members how Mullock financed the Union in its early years. Mullock retained his position as Secretary but stood down as Treasurer in favour of William Wilkins."]}, {"page": "Walter E. Rees", "response": ["Rees was born in 1863 in Neath, the son of Joseph Cook Rees, a builder and contractor. Rees was educated in his home town and later in Barnstable, and on leaving school followed his father into the local building trade.Smith (1980), p. 98. In 1888, Rees began his long association with rugby when he was appointed as secretary of Neath Rugby Football Club, a position he would hold until 1894, when he was made the club's treasurer. In 1889 he was elected to the Match Committee of the Welsh Football Union, later to be renamed the Welsh Rugby Union, along with Horace Lyne.Smith (1980), p. 51. In a hostile meeting of the WRU in 1891, several members of the board attempted to unseat the then secretary and treasurer Richard Mullock. Rees was proposed by Swansea member William Gwynn as a replacement for the secretary post, but after a plea from Lyne and W.D. Phillips, who reminded how Mulloch, as WRU founder, had financed the union through its early years, Rees withdrew his tender.Smith (1980), p. 52.", "In 1892, Rees made two proposals to the WFU; the first was for the union to donate 100 guineas to the Tondu Park Slip Colliery disaster, the second was to introduce a set of standards that clubs would be required to achieve before becoming members of the union.Smith (1980), p. 53. That same year, Mullock resigned as secretary of the WFU, and was succeeded by William Gwynn; but in 1895 Gwynn suffered a mental breakdown and his duties were covered by the Treasurer, William Wilkins. At the next Annual General Meeting, Rees was elected to the post of Secretary instead of Gwynn."]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union families", "response": ["*David Gwynn and William Gwynn; brothers"]}, {"page": "Gwyn (name)", "response": ["*William Gwynn (1856\u20131897), Welsh rugby player"]}, {"page": "Gwynn, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Gwynn"]}]}}
