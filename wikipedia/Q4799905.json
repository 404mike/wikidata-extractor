These aircraft continued shadowing. At about 1830, Tenedos was detached to return to Singapore, because she was running low on fuel, with instructions to contact Rear Admiral Arthur Palliser, detailed to act as liaison to RAF in Malaya,Stephen, p. 106. Phillips' intention was no longer to attack Singora, though Phillips changed course at 1900 toward Singora, to deceive the shadowing aircraft, then south toward Singapore at 2015, when darkness covered him. Tenedos dutifully reported at 2000, thereby preserving the secrecy of Phillips' position."]}, {"page": "American-British-Dutch-Australian Command", "response": ["** Rear Admiral Arthur Palliser, (British) Royal Navy, deputy commander naval forces"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**Arthur Palliser, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Arthur Palliser, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Sir Arthur Palliser, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Sir Arthur Palliser, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Sir Arthur Palliser, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Sir Arthur Palliser, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Sir Arthur Palliser, Fourth Sea Lord", "**Sir Arthur Palliser, Fourth Sea Lord"]}, {"page": "Palliser", "response": ["* Arthur Palliser (1890\u20131956), British Royal Navy admiral"]}, {"page": "Fourth Sea Lord", "response": ["*Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Palliser 1944\u20131946"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Layton", "response": ["In January 1942, the short-lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) was formed, to direct Allied forces in South East Asia and the South West Pacific.

Phillips had long held the opinion that aircraft were no threat to surface ships, and so he took Force Z, consisting of HMS Prince of Wales, HMS Repulse, and four destroyers (HMS Electra, HMS Express, HMAS Vampire and HMS Tenedos) to intercept the Japanese without air cover. That decision has been discussed ever since. Force Z sailed from Singapore at 17:35 on 8 December. Admiral Phillips left his chief of staff, Rear Admiral Arthur Palliser, at the command post ashore. Phillips used HMS Prince of Wales as his flagship."]}, {"page": "East Indies Station", "response": ["|36 ||Admiral || 25px || Sir Arthur Palliser ||(1946\u20131948)"]}, {"page": "Alan Scott-Moncrieff", "response": ["After the war, Scott-Moncrieff was made Chief of Staff to Admiral Sir Arthur Palliser, Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies and then commanded  from 1949.
