He is considered as the last lob bowler to play first-class cricket purely as a bowler.\nTrevor Molony studied at Repton and Pembroke College, Cambridge. He appeared in but did not take any wickets in the Freshers match but another fine performance for his college won the attention of Digby Jephson. Jephson, himself a former first-class cricketer who bowled underarm, who was then involved in Cambridge cricket, recommended him for Surrey's pre-season trial match at The Oval in April 1921. He took the wicket of Jack Hobbs (who apparently gave away his wicket) in the first innings and three more in the second.\nThis led to him being selected for the Surrey's match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May at the recommendation of the Surrey captain Percy Fender. Surrey was dismissed for 76 and Notts reached 170 for 5 when Molony was introduced into bowling. The Cricketer reported that Molony \"is a lob bowler who bowls leg theory and bowls it accurately, too. He varies the flight of the ball excellently and bowls an exceedingly good full-toss at awkward height\". Bowling with eight men on the leg side, Molony went on to take three wickets for 11 runs in seven overs, Notts being all-out for 201. Cricketer recorded  that \"the attempts of the last few batsmen were ludicrous, which evinced much laughter from the crowd, which showed their unmistakable delight in seeing a lob bowler go on\".\nMolony took one wicket in his next match against Leicestershire, Albert Lord being caught by the Surrey wicket-keeper Herbert Strudwick who \"had to catch it or be almost decapitated\". Possibly on the protest from Strudwick, he was then dropped from the side. Molony was given one more match against Warwickshire in June, but he took no more wickets. He was never again selected for Surrey or their Second XI.\nHe continued in Club cricket for many more years playing for Repton Pilgrims. During the war he was a Station Commander in the RAF.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Underarm bowling", "response": ["The last specialist lob bowler to play first-class cricket in England was Trevor Molony who made three appearances in the County Championship for Surrey in 1921, by which time the style was already essentially defunct. ", "Underarm bowling became virtually extinct after the First World War.  Trevor Molony, who represented Surrey in three matches in 1921, is considered as the last specialist lob-bowler to play first-class cricket. However, Gerald Brodribb in his book on this subject lists about twenty-five instances since that time when underarm lob bowling was employed as an occasional tactic in first-class matches. The list of bowlers who have tried this includes Hedley Verity, Jack Iverson, Mike Brearley, George Brown, Wilf Wooller, Maharaja of Patiala and Fred Root."]}, {"page": "Percy Fender", "response": ["Fender had greater success for Surrey in 1921. For the second year in succession Surrey played Middlesex in the final game of the season, to decide the County Championship, and again they lost. They finished second in the table, but were hampered throughout the season by a lack of quality bowling. Wisden praised Fender's intelligent handling of his modest bowling resources, and stated that much of Surrey's success came from his captaincy. Several of Surrey's victories were very close, and had came after Fender declared.Streeton, p. 119. Fender took the brave decision to include a lob bowler, Trevor Molony, in three games; lob bowling had practically died out from first-class cricket by this time, and Molony was the last specialist underarm bowler selected in county cricket. But Molony met with fairly limited success and faded out of cricket.Streeton, p. 121. Owing to the lack of penetrative alternatives, Fender had to use his own bowling frequently, and often conceded many runs. Wisden said he was generally effective with the ball and described his slip fielding as \"dazzling\", but suggested that perhaps his best batting came for teams other than Surrey. In all first-class matches Fender completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets for the first time; he scored 1,152 runs at 21.33 and took 134 wickets at 26.58. He also took 53 catches to become the first cricketer to pass 50 catches while completing the double; as of 2021, only Peter Walker has also done so.Streeton, p. 116."]}, {"page": "Molony", "response": ["*Trevor Molony (1897\u20131962), cricketer"]}]}}
