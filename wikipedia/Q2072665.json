After serving as a pilot, then a flight commander and finally as a squadron commander during the First World War, he served as a flying instructor during the inter-war years before becoming Director of Staff Duties and then Assistant Chief of the Air Staff at the Air Ministry.\nDuring the Second World War Douglas clashed with other senior commanders over strategy in the Battle of Britain. Douglas argued for a more aggressive engagement with a 'Big Wing' strategy i.e. using massed fighters to defend the United Kingdom against enemy bombers. He then became  Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Fighter Command in which role he was responsible for rebuilding the command's strength after the attrition of the Battle of Britain, but also for bringing it on the offensive to wrest the initiative in the air from the German Luftwaffe.\nDouglas went on to be Air Officer Commanding in Chief of RAF Middle East Command in which role he was an advocate of Operation Accolade, a planned British amphibious assault on Rhodes and the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea, and was disappointed when it was abandoned. He became commander of the British Zone of Occupation in Germany after the war.\nFrom 1949 to 1964 he served as chairman of British European Airways.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Douglas (surname)", "response": ["* Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside (1893\u20131969), British air force officer"]}, {"page": "Baron William Sholto Douglas of Kirtleside", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside"]}, {"page": "Marshal of the air force", "response": ["|United Kingdom||1946||75px||Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside||Marshal of the Royal Air Force||1893||1969||Promoted 1 January 1946."]}, {"page": "William Sholto Douglas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside"]}]}}
