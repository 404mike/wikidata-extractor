He thought that it was built by the British Celtic peoples, and surmised that \"it is natural to imagine, from the many sacred erections, that this place must have been intended for holy uses, or a court of justice\". In 1861 historian John Gardner Wilkinson wrote that the site \"bears the marked characteristics of an ancient British [Iron Age] fort\", whilst antiquarian and barrow-digger Thomas Bateman stated that he thought the encampment had been set up as a defence against Constantine the Great during the Roman rule of Britain. Isaac Chalkley Gould also dismissed Rooke's idea that the enclosure had a sacred use, writing that it may have been used as a temporary fortified camp or refuge. Following a limited excavation of the turf embankment by Frank Gerald Simpson in 1950, Cecily Margaret Piggott concluded that the rampart was constructed in the Early Middle Ages possibly in the 5th or 6th centuries as it is similar in construction techniques to some ramparts of this period in Scotland. Some more recent historians agree with the view that the fortifications date from 'the Romano-British period at the start of the Dark Ages, maybe about 500 AD'. https://www.cressbrook.co.uk/visits/carlwark.php.

Since the late 20th century, the Nine Ladies has been regarded as a sacred site by modern Pagan groups who conduct rituals there.

", "The antiquarian Hayman Rooke noted the existence of the Nine Ladies, which he considered \"a Druid temple,\" in a 1782 article about the heritage of Stanton Moor published in the journal Archaeologia. The idea that Britain's prehistoric monuments had been built by the druids, ritual specialists present in parts of Iron Age Western Europe, was one that had attracted broad support among antiquarians over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, having been adopted by influential writers such as John Aubrey and William Stukeley.  This idea was repeated by the antiquarian Thomas Bateman in his 1848 book Vestiges of the Antiquities of Derbyshire, where he described the Nine Ladies as a \"druidical circle.\" He included an illustration of the monument, in which the surrounding landscape had been embellished.
