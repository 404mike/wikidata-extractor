He was the first holder of the Rylands Chair of Biblical Criticism and Exegesis in the University of Manchester, from its establishment as an independent institution in 1904. He was thus the first non-Anglican to become a professor of divinity in an English university.Peake popularized modern biblical scholarship, including the new \"higher criticism.\" He approached the Bible not as the infallible word of God, but as the record of revelation written by fallible humans.", "link_mentions": {}}}
