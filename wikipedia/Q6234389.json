This involved a  drive to Sheikh Meskine then a  journey north, which took nearly two days due to the state of the roads. Meanwhile, Blackburn was recalled to Rosh Pinna in Palestine to receive orders from the commander of the Damascus front, Major General John Fullerton Evetts of the British 6th Infantry Division, who directed him to assist the \"weary and disheartened\" Free French forward to Damascus. To achieve this task, his force was trimmed to a reinforced company of the 2/3rd and five anti-tank guns, totalling around 400 men. Blackburn arrived at Free French headquarters on 20 June, where he was told that their attack had faltered about  south of Damascus."]}, {"page": "Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Sir John Fullerton Evetts"]}, {"page": "Special Night Squads", "response": ["The British 16th Brigade, under Brigadier John Fullerton Evetts, supplied three twelve-man squads including officers, to the new unit.

Evetts Field is now only semi operational, mostly used as an emergency runway for the Flying Doctor and for RAAF operations. It features two runways, each  long. Evetts Field was used for launching the Jindivik target drone from 31 October 1950 to June 1975. The airfield was virtually abandoned in the 1970s, with its control tower and other buildings sold off and removed.
