He remained very active as a Swahili language scholar until his death in Nairobi, 1967. Many Africanists, anthropologists and linguists greatly benefited from H.E. Lambert's expert knowledge and generous assistance in the field and in their subsequent research. Among those he mentored were A. H. J. Prins, who did ethnographic research on the Taita and, subsequently, the coastal Swahili,Returning from fieldwork in Kenya, Prins named his 4th son after Lambert, who thus became a \"classificatory grandfather\" to the newborn who became an anthropologist as well and Philip Gulliver who researched the Turkana."]}, {"page": "Legal anthropology", "response": ["One example of such an interest is expressed by Philip Gulliver, 1963, Social Control in an African Society in which the intimate relations between disputes are postulated as being important.
