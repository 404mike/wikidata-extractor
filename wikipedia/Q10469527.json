A striker, he made over 150 appearances in the English Football League and had spells playing in Hong Kong and the Netherlands.\nA product of the Scottish Highland Football League, Clayton began his professional football career with his home town club, Elgin City FC, then of the Scottish Highland Football League, prior to transferring to England with Derby County, signing with the club at the age of 17 after completing his A-levels. He was forced to retire in 1993 due to persistent back problems that required surgery.Following his retirement, Clayton moved to Bristol in 1995 because of his wife's business and started assisting Bristol City to coach the various levels of youth football at their academy where his son Jon was playing. He later worked as assistant to Keith Millen with the club's under-17 side and, in October 2006, he was appointed as head coach of Bristol City's academy. In a backroom reshuffle in 2012, Clayton was put in charge of the under-18's side with Willie McStay replacing him as academy boss.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tommy Tynan", "response": ["In the 1984/85 season, Tynan was joint top scorer in all 4 divisions of the Football League with 31 goals, level with Tranmere's John Clayton. Clayton, ironically, joined Argyle as Tynan's replacement, when Tynan signed for Rotherham United in the summer of 1985. However, Tynan rejoined Argyle in early 1986, initially on loan, as the club pushed for promotion to the second tier. His excellent goalscoring record continued at that level and he became a club legend. In total Tynan scored 126 goals in 262 appearances for Plymouth. Former England manager Graham Taylor described him as one of the best natural finishers he had ever seen."]}, {"page": "Colin Clarke (footballer, born 1962)", "response": ["Along with fellow striker John Clayton, he formed one of the deadliest strike-forces in the Football League by scoring 22 goals that season, but the 1984\u201385 campaign ended in disappointment as Tranmere just missed out on promotion. He was then transferred to Third Division club AFC Bournemouth and scored 26 goals, though again his goals were not enough to win his club promotion."]}, {"page": "John Clayton", "response": ["John Clayton may refer to:", "*John Clayton (painter) (1728\u20131800), English artist", "*John Clayton Adams (1840\u20131906), English landscape artist ", "*John Clayton (Australian actor) (1940\u20132003), Australian actor", "*John Clayton (British actor) (1845\u20131888), British actor", "*John Clayton (bassist) (born 1952), American jazz bassist", "*John Clayton (sportswriter) (born 1954), writer and reporter for ESPN and SportsCenter", "*John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, birthname of the fictional character Tarzan", "*John Clayton (Roundhead) (1620\u2013?), English politician", "*John Clayton (town clerk) (1792\u20131890), antiquarian and town clerk of Newcastle upon Tyne, England", "*John Clayton Allen (1860\u20131939), American politician", "*John Clayton (cricketer) (1857\u20131938), English cricketer", "*John Clayton (footballer, born 1961), Scottish footballer", "*John Clayton (footballer, born 1907), English footballer", "*John Clayton (rugby union) (1848\u20131924), England rugby union player", "*John Clayton (1657\u20131725), rector of Crofton, West Yorkshire, and scientific author", "*John Clayton (botanist) (1694\u20131773), colonial Virginia", "*John Clayton (divine) (1709\u20131773), English cleric, Methodist and Jacobite", "*John Clayton (minister) (1754\u20131843), English Independent"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 in English football", "response": ["*John Clayton (Tranmere Rovers) \u2013 31 goals"]}, {"page": "Sigi Lens", "response": ["Lens left AZ in 1986 and signed a new contract at Fortuna Sittard.
