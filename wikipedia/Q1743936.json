Shaw believed that the interview would last 1 hour and 30 minutes but it actually lasted just under 7 hours. Shaw went ahead with the interview as he believes that schools attempting to teach the Holocaust in a 50-minute history lesson is 'a disgrace', and is also trying to get the interview played at schools. Listener feedback has said that the interview has been inspiring and interesting and makes one think in disbelief that the Holocaust only happened 60 years ago. Shaw himself has said \"This has changed my life and the best thing I have done in a long time\" and audience feedback has been generally positive."]}, {"page": "Holocaust Educational Trust", "response": ["Lord Browne also chaired a steering group with Regional Ambassadors on 9 July 2013 along with Doreen Lawrence OBE, Prof. Yehuda Bauer and Holocaust survivor, Kitty Hart-Moxon, discussing \"why and how we remember the Holocaust and how we can communicate its relevance in contemporary British society.\""]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (K)", "response": ["# Kitty Hart-Moxon"]}, {"page": "Essie Harrison", "response": ["Holby City Producer Simon Harper personally decided to create the storyline because he had a European upbringing and studied the Holocaust extensively. He was particularly interested in stories of escaped war criminals and he believed it was inevitable that he would cover the subject during his career. Harper explained to a representative of the Holocaust Educational Trust, that Holby City thrives from stories of character's professional ethics being challenged by their personal demons. He noted that Joe's story worked well against pitted Jewish registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) having to treat a patient pretending to be \"a sweet old man\" despite him helping to kill Jews in World War II. The production team was also keen to portray antisemitism in the spotlight. Harper added Kate Verghese, the story producer, pitched the idea of a Jewish doctor being conflicted by a Nazi.
