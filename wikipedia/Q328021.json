He is best known for his acclaimed completion of Edward Elgar's third symphony, which subsequently gained wide acceptance into Elgar's oeuvre. Apart from opera, his own works include representatives of most traditional genres, and although he made substantial contributions to orchestral and choral repertoire, he is particularly noted for his chamber music. Many of these chamber works were written for his wife, the soprano Jane Manning, and the new music ensemble Jane's Minstrels, which he founded with Manning in 1988. Initially an unrelenting proponent of modernist music, by the 1980s his compositions had embraced aspects of the late romanticism of England, described by his colleague Susan Bradshaw as \"modernized nostalgia\". His mature style is thus characterised by a highly individualised combination of modernism and English romanticism, as well as numerology, wide spaced harmonies, specific intervallic characterisations, and the frequent alternation between strict and fluid rhythmic frameworks.\nBorn in London, Payne first seriously studied music at Durham University. Though a composer since childhood, his professional career began around 1969 with his first major work, the Phoenix Mass for choir and brass band, which was firmly rooted in the modernist tradition. He continued to write choral and vocal works, almost exclusively to British poets, particularly Thomas Hardy, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Edward Thomas. From his 1981 chamber work A Day in the Life of a Mayfly on, he synthesised aspects of English romanticism from his primary influences, Elgar, Delius and Vaughan Williams. Two orchestral commissions for The Proms, The Spirit's Harvest (1985) and Time's Arrow (1990) were well received. After several years, Payne created a completed version of Elgar's unfinished third symphony, which brought him international attention and future commissions for completions and orchestrations of works by Delius, Elgar and Finzi. Unsure of his musical identity, Payne found difficulty in subsequent composition until the 2002 orchestral Proms commission, Visions and Journeys (2002). Further major works include The Period of Cosmographie (2010) and Of Land, Sea and Sky (2016) for The Proms. He died in April 2021, a month after the death of his wife.\nPayne held academic posts at various institutions throughout his career, including Mills College, the London College of Music, the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, the University of Western Australia and the University of East Anglia. Despite regular commissions from a variety of English ensembles, Payne was not a particularly mainstream composer and was forced to supplement his income with writings. A renowned critic, he wrote for The Daily Telegraph, The Independent and Country Life. Other writings include publications on a variety of musical topics, notably Schoenberg (1968)\u2014a study on the composer Arnold Schoenberg\u2014and numerous works on the music of Frank Bridge, to whom he was particularly devoted.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 30", "response": ["*2021 \u2013 Anthony Payne,  English composer (b. 1936)"]}, {"page": "August 2", "response": ["*1936 \u2013 Anthony Payne, English composer and author (d. 2021)"]}, {"page": "Edward Elgar", "response": ["In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932.Reed, p. 142 He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion.Moore (1979), pp. 42\u201347, 56\u201359, 96\u201398Aldous, p. 124 He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would \"tinker\" with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony,Reed, p. 145 but at other times he said, \"If I can't complete the Third Symphony, somebody will complete it \u2013 or write a better one.\"Payne, Anthony (1998), Liner notes to NMC compact disc D053 After Elgar's death, Percy M.

The Third Symphony sketches were elaborated by the composer Anthony Payne into a complete score in 1997.", "After the Cello Concerto, Elgar completed no more large-scale works. He made arrangements of works by Bach, Handel and Chopin, in distinctively Elgarian orchestration, and once again turned his youthful notebooks to use for the Nursery Suite (1931). His other compositions of this period have not held a place in the regular repertory. For most of the rest of the twentieth century, it was generally agreed that Elgar's creative impulse ceased after his wife's death. Anthony Payne's elaboration of the sketches for Elgar's Third Symphony led to a reconsideration of this supposition. Elgar left the opening of the symphony complete in full score, and those pages, along with others, show Elgar's orchestration changed markedly from the richness of his pre-war work. The Gramophone described the opening of the new work as something \"thrilling\u00a0... unforgettably gaunt\".Cowan, Rob, Review, Gramophone, March 2000, p. 61 Payne also subsequently produced a performing version of the sketches for a sixth Pomp and Circumstance March, premiered at the Proms in August 2006.Clements, Andrew, \"BBCSO/Davis\" , The Guardian, 4 August 2006. Retrieved 27 October 2010. Elgar's sketches for a piano concerto dating from 1913 were elaborated by the composer Robert Walker and first performed in August 1997 by the pianist David Owen Norris.

Also included was an article titled \"Circumstantial Evidence\" by the Elgar authority Christopher Kent from the August 1997 Musical Times explaining the sketches. One idea in the sketches was marked by the composer \"jolly good\". Kent believed that Elgar's compositional thoughts and time were by then engaged with the Third Symphony and The Spanish Lady, and that the main theme for the march was \"unpromising\". Payne felt there was not enough in the sketches to complete the march, but three pages of score in Elgar's handwriting were discovered at the Royal School of Church Music Colles Library marked \"P&C 6\". In 2006, the score and sketches were turned into a performing version. Payne observed in the programme notes that \"Nowhere else in the Pomp and Circumstance marches does Elgar combine compound and duple metres in this way\". Payne concluded the piece with a brief allusion to the first Pomp and Circumstance March. The world premiere of Payne's version was on 2 August 2006 with Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at The Proms at Royal Albert Hall. The first recording was by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Richard Hickox."]}, {"page": "Alan Bush", "response": ["Many of Bush's best-known works were written in the immediate postwar years.  Anthony Payne described the Three Concert Studies for Piano Trio (Op. 31) of 1947 as exceeding Britten in its inventiveness, \"a high-water mark in Bush's mature art\".  The Violin Concerto (Op. 32, 1948) has been cited as \"a work as beautiful and refined as any in the genre since Walton's\". Foreman considers the concerto, which uses twelve-tone themes, to be the epitome of Bush's thematic theory of composition, although Bush's contemporary, Edmund Rubbra, thought it too intellectual for general audiences.Foreman, pp. 118\u201319 The Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue for timpani, percussion and strings, (Op. 52, 1959), involves eight variations in the Dorian mode, followed by eight in other modes culminating in a final quadruple fugue in six parts.Foreman, p. 141 Musical Opinions critic praised the composer's \"wonderful control and splendid craftsmanship\" in this piece, and predicted that it could become the most popular of all Bush's orchestral works.

In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: Tony Palmer's O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams and John Bridcut's The Passions of Vaughan Williams.Frogley and Thomson, p. 2 British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer.

The early music is often instrumentally difficult or orchestrally and harmonically complex; from about 1913 onwards he moved towards a simpler, sparer style. The composer and musicologist Anthony Payne considered that Bax's best works date from the period between 1910 and 1925: he instances The Garden of Fand, Tintagel, November Woods, the Second Piano Sonata, Viola Sonata, and first two symphonies.Payne Anthony \"Review: Bax at Length\", The Musical Times, August 1973, 114 (1566), p. 798 By the 1930s Bax's music ceased to be regarded as new and difficult, and towards the end of that decade it was attracting less attention than before."]}, {"page": "Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["The orchestra under Paavo Berglund made the world premiere recording of Sibelius's Kullervo in 1970.

An ability to construct long musical paragraphs is, according to the Delius scholar Christopher Palmer, Delius's lasting debt to Wagner, from whom he also acquired a knowledge of chromatic harmonic technique, \"an endlessly proliferating sensuousness of sound\".Palmer, pp. 95\u201396 Grieg, however, was perhaps the composer who influenced him more than any other. The Norwegian composer, like Delius, found his primary inspiration in nature and in folk-melodies, and was the stimulus for the Norwegian flavour that characterises much of Delius's early music.Palmer, pp. 46\u201350 The music writer Anthony Payne observes that Grieg's \"airy texture and non-developing use of chromaticism showed [Delius] how to lighten the Wagnerian load\". Early in his career Delius drew inspiration from Chopin, later from his own contemporaries Ravel and Richard Strauss,Fenby (1971), p. 82, Palmer, p. 98 and from the much younger Percy Grainger, who first brought the tune of Brigg Fair to Delius's notice.Palmer, pp. 89\u201390"]}]}}
