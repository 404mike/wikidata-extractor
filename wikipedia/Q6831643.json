Protestant views were set forth by Stokes, \"Ireland and the Celtic Church to 1172\" (London, 1886), Loofs (1882), and Zimmer (1907).

Thomas Scott, and its first patron was Robert Jocelyn, 3rd Earl of Roden,Reformed Romanist Priests' Protection Society 1854, p.3 a leading evangelical within the Second Reformation of Anglicanism, who said that the Society helped \"unfortunate men [who] would be persecuted by the Church they left, and suspected by that which they joined\". Its foundation on 5 May 1844 was marked by a service in St. Audoen's Church of Ireland church in which \"the Rev. Solomon Frost renounced Popery\". Scott was curate of St. Audoen's parish from 1831 to 1848, and maintained a parish register instigated by Mortimer O'Sullivan in 1827 listing such conversion services. In the three years after Frost, Scott recorded the conversion at St. Audoen's of four more priests, a monk, and two seminarians. Although Michael John Brenan was said by the Catholic Encyclopedia to have been supported by the Priests' Protection Society in the interval from his conversion to his recantation, in fact this was in 1809, decades before the Society's foundation.
