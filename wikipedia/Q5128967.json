After living on the Isle of Wight in his father's house at Cowes, he moved in 1892 to Ipswich where worked with John Ellor Taylor, then Curator of the Ipswich Museum.\nHe married in 1904, living in Monk Soham until his death. He had no radio, telephone, or electricity in his house. E.A. Elliott was a close friend as was Arthur Chitty.\nMorley worked first on Coleoptera, then Hemiptera and then Ichneumonidae. His magnum opus was the five volume Ichneumons of Great Britain (1903\u20131914). \nMorley's collection of mainly Suffolk material covering the period 1898\u20131951 is in Ipswich Museum.

His interest deepened after Lord Walsingham and George Hampson published \"On Moths Collected at Aden and in Somaliland\" in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London in 1896. This article was based on Nurse's specimens and species new to science were described. Nurse later widened his interest to other orders of insects, especially Hymenoptera. At this time, Indian Hymenoptera were neglected. Nurse described many new species and added greatly to knowledge of the group. Many Nurse Hymenoptera specimens were described by Charles Thomas Bingham, Peter Cameron, and Claude Morley in The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma."]}]}}
