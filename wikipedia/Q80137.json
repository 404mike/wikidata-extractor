Thus, for example, Lockwood, the first narrator of the story, tells the story of Nelly, who herself tells the story of another character.

This debate had been launched in 1844 by Robert Chambers.

Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Bront\u00ebs.\" In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel \u2014 while acclaiming it as \"the first presentment of that Feminist novel\", she stated that \"it bores to tears.\" Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: \"If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines.\" The only thing Sinclair wholly approved of was the author's treatment of marital laws of the time: \"Anne Bront\u00eb attacks her problem with a freedom and audacity before which her sisters\u2019 boldest enterprises seem cowardly and restrained...
