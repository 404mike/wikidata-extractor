His career best of 6 for 91 against Derbyshire County Cricket Club at Dewsbury,  helped spin Yorkshire to a win by an innings and 22 runs. Wilfred Rhodes, who had destroyed the Derbyshire batting in the first innings, failed to take a wicket as the 21-year-old Bedford bowled 32 overs with six maidens for his 6 for 91. He scored 57 runs at 14.25, with a top score of 24 against Essex.\nHe played at least 27 times for Yorkshire Second XI from 1926 to 1933, and was unlucky not to feature again in the first team.\nBedford died aged 60, in July 1968 in Croydon, Surrey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Bedford", "response": ["Harry Bedford may refer to:", "*Harry Bedford (rugby) (1866\u20131929), rugby union footballer of the 1880s and 1890s for England and Batley", "*Harry Bedford (music hall) (1873\u20131939), English music hall entertainer", "*Harry Bedford (politician) (1877\u20131918), New Zealand politician", "*Harry Bedford (footballer) (1899\u20131976), English footballer", "*Harry Bedford (cricketer) (1907\u20131968), English cricketer"]}]}}
