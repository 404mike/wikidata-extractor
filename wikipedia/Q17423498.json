After ten years serving under the captaincy of his step-mother's brother, Henry Blackwood, Jones reached the rank of commander by age 25, and captain at 38, but never actually sailed as a captain.\nAged 40, Jones entered Parliament for County Londonderry, in the interest of the Marquess of Waterford.\nAn Orangeman and Ultra Tory\nof \"plain unassuming manners\",\nhe sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at Westminster from 1830 until he stood down from Parliament in 1857.
