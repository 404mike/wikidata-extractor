The County Londonderry-born son of a Church of Ireland clergyman, Jones was descended from a 17th-century Welsh settler in Ireland. Several generations of his family had held public office in the Kingdom of Ireland, including membership of the pre-union Parliament of Ireland.\nEntering the navy aged 13 during the Napoleonic Wars, the teenage Jones survived several naval engagements and the burning of his ship at night when he was 16. After ten years serving under the captaincy of his step-mother's brother, Henry Blackwood, Jones reached the rank of commander by age 25, and captain at 38, but never actually sailed as a captain.\nAged 40, Jones entered Parliament for County Londonderry, in the interest of the Marquess of Waterford.\nAn Orangeman and Ultra Tory\nof \"plain unassuming manners\",\nhe sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at Westminster from 1830 until he stood down from Parliament in 1857.  A member of several learned societies, he occupied his retirement from politics by making the first comprehensive catalogue of Irish lichens, laying the foundation of Irish lichenology.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"5\" | Theobald Jones"]}, {"page": "Toby", "response": ["* Toby or Theobald Jones (1790\u20131868), Irish Royal Navy admiral, Tory politician, lichenologist and fossil collector"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|County Londonderry(two members)||Theobald Jones||Conservative"]}, {"page": "1868 in Ireland", "response": ["*7 February \u2013 Admiral Theobald Jones, lichenologist and Unionist politician (born 1790)."]}, {"page": "1864 in Ireland", "response": ["* May \u2013 Theobald Jones presents his Report on the progress made in collecting the Irish lichens to the Natural History Society of Dublin."]}, {"page": "1790 in Ireland", "response": ["*15 April \u2013 Theobald Jones, British Royal Navy officer, lichenologist and Unionist politician (died 1868)."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Jones", "response": ["*Theobald Jones (1790\u20131868), also known as Toby Jones, Irish officer in the Royal Navy, MP for County Londonderry, and lichenologist"]}, {"page": "Toby Jones (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Theobald Jones (1790\u20131868), also known as Toby Jones, Irish officer in the Royal Navy, MP for County Londonderry, and lichenologist"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|County Londonderry(two members)||Theobald Jones||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|County Londonderry(two members)||Theobald Jones||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of paleontologists", "response": ["* Theobald Jones (Ireland, 1790-1868)"]}, {"page": "Theophilus Jones", "response": ["* Theophilus Jones (Royal Navy officer) (1760\u20131835), Irish Admiral in the Royal Navy, uncle of Theobald Jones"]}, {"page": "Theophilus Jones (Royal Navy officer)", "response": ["His older brother Walter (1754\u20131839) was governor of County Leitrim, and an MP for Coleraine in the latter years of the Irish Parliament, and then sat for Coleraine at Westminster for most of the period until 1809.
