The team had an indifferent start to the season, with the highlight being a 1\u20130 victory at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 22 September. Having seen their team pick up just seven points from an available 27 in November and December, a section of travelling supporters booed and heckled Aspin during a 1\u20131 draw at Lincoln City on New Year's Day; Aspin reacted badly to the fan's \"lack of respect\" towards him and considered quitting his role, but said that he decided to stay because he had the support of the players and chairman Norman Smurthwaite. However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch. I fully accept results from December have been poor and expected to be higher up the table and know the players are capable of doing that.\""]}, {"page": "Aston Villa F.C.

Aspin made his fourth loan signing of the summer later that week, bringing in 19-year-old Aston Villa full-back Mitch Clark as cover for James Gibbons and Cristian Monta\u00f1o.
