It comprehensively fails contrast testing:  (foreground: #0645a8, background: #808080). I request we change the 'priest' background colour to #bdbdbd (which passes three out of four without becoming too pale.) Alternatively we could do something with bold dark borders like e.g. :Template:Deans of Winchester. (PS: the cardinal colour #ff66666 also fails; #ffa4a4 is the closest that passes.)
