Believing that he has no choice but to end it all, Tom ventures into a derelict squat in East London, in an attempt to purchase a gun from homeless crack addict D (Ashley Walters). However, D attempts to extort more than the agreed price, in order to pay off his debt to local drug dealer Hoodwink (Andy Serkis), to whom he owes a significant amount of money. However, the gun is not his to sell - it actually belongs to Hoodwink, who will do anything in his power to get it back. Tom's attempts to reason with Hoodwink leave him with more trouble than he bargained for - and trying to buy him off only gets him seriously abused. Despite trying unsuccessfully to shift the blame onto not-so-macho drug dealer Ray (Adam Deacon), Tom and D gradually get to know what makes each other tick - and digress for reasonable life - as they try to find a way out of the situation.
