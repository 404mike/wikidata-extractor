The album was delayed due to scheduling conflicts and continued work in the studio, and the band's sixth studio album Kicking Up the Dust was eventually released 21 April 2017.

Shields relocated to a total of 19 other studios and hired a number of engineers, including Alan Moulder, Anjali Dutt and Guy Fixsen. As the recording was taking so long, Shields and Creation agreed to release two interim EPs, Glider (1990) and Tremolo (1991).

Critical reception to Loveless was almost unanimous with praise, although the album was not a commercial success, peaking at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failing to chart internationally.

These labels allowed Dextrous further creative freedom, the former being his platform to express his jazz roots. As a trio, Paul, Jon and Dex recorded under the moniker Solid State. Collectively, they have been credited as one of the pioneers of the liquid funk scene. Together they created the sound they branded \"urban fusion\" to cover all of the creative influences evident in their music, including jazz, dub, Detroit techno, garage, funk and reggae.

The backing track was faster than intended, with what Morris described as \"a really bad speed up during the first three bars of the first chorus\", but the take had to be used because those involved were impressed with Liam's vocals, and Morris had to mix the track three times, using delay and other processing to hide the mistakes. When the album was finished, Morris said it would \"wipe the field with any competition\u00a0... It's astonishing. It's the Bollocks for this decade.\" Creation Records boss Alan McGee was similarly enthused, saying that \"You just cannot slag this record. It's gonna speak to real, working class lads in a way that a Suede or Radiohead could only dream of doing.\" The title (What's the Story) Morning Glory? was inspired by Noel's friend Melissa Lim answering the phone with said phrase, which is itself derived from a line from the film Bye Bye Birdie - presumably itself a reference to the 1938 Mary Lou Williams jazz standard of the same name."]}, {"page": "Souvlaki (album)", "response": ["While touring Europe in early 1992, Slowdive began tentative work on Souvlaki, writing and recording multiple takes of around 40 potential songs.

Dave Simpson of Melody Maker wrote: \"'Sing' aside, I would rather drown choking in a bath full of porridge than ever listen to it again.\" John Mulvey of NME reacted with muted praise, calling Souvlaki \"another exemplary product from spangly guitar heaven\" but ultimately deeming it a \"pretty but unfulfilled\" album.

I thought it was too confrontational.\" However, in an interview with the music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a \"regular, everyday collection of tunes.\" To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising.
