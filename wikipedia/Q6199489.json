The government had decided that the shipyards should operate without state subsidy, which would have resulted in at least six thousand job losses. An engineer by trade and shop steward of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, Reid, along with his colleagues Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Gilmore and Sammy Barr, decided that the best way to show the viability of keeping the yards open was by staging a work-in rather than by going on strike. This meant that the workers would continue to complete what orders the shipyard had until the government changed policy."]}, {"page": "Upper Clyde Shipbuilders", "response": ["Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) was a Scottish shipbuilding consortium, created in 1968 as a result of the amalgamation of five major shipbuilders of the River Clyde. It entered liquidation, with much controversy, in 1971. That led to a \"work-in\" campaign at the company's shipyards, involving shop stewards Jimmy Airlie and Jimmy Reid, among others.", "The work-in was led by a group of young shop stewards, including Jimmy Reid, Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Barr and Sammy Gilmore, the former three being members of the Communist Party of Great Britain.  Reid wanted to ensure the workers projected the best image of the yard workers he possibly could, and he insisted on tight discipline. He addressed the workers at the yards, where he instructed them that there should be \"no hooliganism, no vandalism and no bevvying [drinking]\".There will be bevvying, The Scotsman, 16 July 2002"]}, {"page": "Charlie Whelan", "response": ["In 1980 Whelan became a foreign exchange dealer.

Barr was credited with coming up with the idea for a work-in, which gained a lot of publicity and forced the UK Government into a reversal, saving 6,000 jobs at the shipyard.    Barr was a lifelong friend to fellow UCS activists Jimmy Airlie and Sammy Gilmore.
