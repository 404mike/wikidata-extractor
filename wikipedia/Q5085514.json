He played as a centre half or wing half.\nSimms was born in Birmingham in 1859. He played for Calthorpe and Mitchell St George's before joining Small Heath Alliance in 1884. His first FA Cup match for the club came in the same year, and in the 1885\u201386 season he played in all their games up to and including the semi-final, which Small Heath lost 4\u20130 to West Bromwich Albion. By the time Small Heath became involved in league football, in the Football Alliance in the 1889\u201390 season, injury problems meant he could play only rarely, though he continued until 1892\u201393, the inaugural season of the Football League Second Division. He made his only appearance in the Football League on 7 January 1893, in a 4\u20133 win at Lincoln City, as a late replacement for Caesar Jenkyns who had missed his train.When he retired as a player Simms became the club's trainer, and when the new St Andrew's ground opened in 1906, he was appointed head groundsman, a post he held until January 1914, at which point he retired from football after 30 years' service to the club.Simms died in Birmingham in 1935 at the age of 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1892\u201393 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["All the regular first-team members during the previous season \u2013 goalkeepers Chris Charsley and George Hollis, backs Tom Bayley and Fred Speller, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Harry Morris, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon \u2013 remained with the club. Others from the Football Alliance side included the versatile Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, and the long-serving Charlie Simms, who was by 1892 employed as the first-team trainer, but retained his playing registration for emergencies. Among the newcomers were back Fred Jones from Newton Heath, forward Harry Edwards, signed from Singer's of Coventry,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 124, 141. and centre-forward Frank Mobley, who joined soon after the start of the season, also from Singer's. They played in the same kit as in the previous season: royal blue shirts and stockings with white knickerbockers.", "Small Heath returned to winning ways the following week at home to Walsall Town Swifts, producing what remains, their record League victory: they won 12\u20130. Six goals came in each half, three from Mobley, three by Walton, whose third was the culmination of a \"brilliant run\", and two each from the other three forwards, Hallam, Wheldon and Hands. The goalscoring continued on Christmas Eve with a 6\u20130 victory at Northwich Victoria, and a 3\u20131 home win against Crewe Alexandra which meant Small Heath would begin the new year at the top of the table. On Boxing Day, they visited Aston Villa for a friendly attended by 7,000 spectators. Without both Charsley and George Hollis, trainer Charlie Simms played in goal as Villa won 3\u20132 with the last kick of the game."]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["All the regular first-team members during the previous season remained with the club for the forthcoming Football League season, as did fringe players including the long-serving Charlie Simms, who was by 1892 employed as the first-team trainer, but retained his playing registration for emergencies.

After the match, the Post correspondent described Small Heath as \"a most erratic combination\".Notes on Sport and The Alliance. Small Heath v. Grimsby Town. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 23 February 1891. As if to illustrate the point, they beat leading club Nottingham Forest twice in three days. At Nottingham, on a frosty pitch with bright, low sun that made goalkeeping difficult, the two teams scored alternately, Forest taking the lead and Heath equalising, until 4\u20134, when Short's 73rd-minute winner inflicted Forest's first home league defeat of the season.Football.
