With a career background as an Inspector for local government, he published several known works. First was Report on the Destruction of Town Refuse, published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office in 1888. This was only a short pamphlet of 48 pages, including illustrations of furnaces in use at the time.\nCodrington went on to write the slightly more substantial 172 page work The Maintenance of Macadamised Roads in 1879, published by E. & F.N. Spon.\nHowever, by far Codrington's most famous work was also one of his last. Roman roads in Britain, published originally in 1903, was the first attempt by any author to catalogue fully the evident remains of the Roman transport network in the United Kingdom. Several further editions were subsequently published, and indeed reprinted. The last of these was a reprint of the 3rd edition in 1928.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ladykirk and Norham Bridge", "response": ["It was designed by Thomas Codrington and Cuthbert A.

Archaeologist David E Johnston states that the structure is crossed by numerous perpendicular drainage culverts with small becks trickling through them since the ground is often boggy. This could suggest a reason for the embankment, and its early attribution as a causeway\u2014a route across the wetland, normally supported on earth or stone in the form of a raised embankment. Nineteenth-century antiquarian Thomas Codrington argued that Roman roads in Britain were generally built on embankments regardless of the underlying ground's drainage. He states that the common appellation of \"causeway\" in the names of Roman roads may, therefore, relate to their embankments rather than indicate that the ground on which they were constructed was ill-drained. Some historians translate Livy's phrase for Roman military construction of roads, via munire, as \"making a causeway\".", "Drake personally visited and examined the structure's length and incorporated its description into one of his published works (1736). The causeway was also mentioned in nineteenth-century publications by Walley Oulton (1805), Thomas Hinderwell (1811), George Young (1817), John Phillips (1853), Robert Knox (1855), George Bevan (1884), John Atkinson (1894) and Ralph Horne (1897); and in the twentieth century by Thomas Codrington (1903), Boyd Dawkins, A Austen (1903), Frank Elgee (1912,1923,1933), Kitson Clark (1935), Ivan Margary (1957), Hayes & Rutter (1964) and Nikolaus Pevsner (1966)."]}, {"page": "Codrington", "response": ["* Thomas Codrington (1829\u20131918), British engineer and antiquarian", "* Thomas Codrington (priest) (died  1691), English Catholic theologian"]}, {"page": "Port Way", "response": ["The road was studied by antiquarians such as Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Henry MacLauchlan, Charles Roach Smith, Thomas William Shore, Thomas Codrington, and Ivan Margary, and much of the route can still be traced. The section east of Hannington in Hampshire, however, has not been definitively traced in over 100 years and sources differ on the precise route into the Roman town at Calleva Atrebatum.", "From Calleva Atrebatum, the road continued the south-westerly course of The Devil's Highway (Margary route 4a) from Londinium. Both Ivan Margary and Thomas Codrington believed the road left the town on its western side; Margary favoured the theory that it connected with the town's Lower West Gate, although it possibly connected with the main West Gate. Sir Richard Colt Hoare suggested that the road branched off Margary route 42 \u2013 the road from Calleva Atrebatum to Venta Belgarum (Winchester) \u2013 immediately outside the town's South Gate; this theory was supported in an 1846 article by the British Archaeological Association. The Ordnance Survey's 1911 25 inch to the mile map shows the road to be on a heading congruent with the theory it connected to Calleva Atrebatum's West Gate, although a 1989 article in the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies' Britannia journal shows it leaving the town at the Lower West Gate."]}, {"page": "Codrington, Thomas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Codrington"]}]}}
