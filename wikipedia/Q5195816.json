This result moved Derby up to 11th in the table, 5 points off the play-offs with 4 games remaining, Derby manager Nigel Clough however ruled out a play-off place, wishing there was more the 4 games left as the club picked up 14 points from a possible 21. A 1\u20130 defeat from a late Curtis Main winner against Middlesbrough and a 2\u20130 defeat at Cardiff City with goal from Joe Mason and a goal from defender Mark Hudson from his own half, mathematically ended Derby's play-off chances and ensured Derby will stay in the Championship for a 5th consecutive seasons as Derby dropped to 14th in the table, 8 points off the play-offs with two games to play.

In the biggest attendance of the season at Hillsborough the home players played to match the great atmosphere as they started brilliantly, with Jermaine Johnson firstly dribbling between several players before shooting well wide. After the early first chance the Owls could not stop creating chances as soon after Seyi Olofinjana volleyed over the bar. Wednesday's early attacking pressure soon paid off with just nine-minutes gone. A fantastic long through ball by Miguel Llera saw Steve Howard turn his man and fire an unstoppable shot into the roof of the net, sending Hillsborough wild. Middlesbrough's best chance of the half was a solo effort by Curtis Main but his shot went comfortably wide. Sheffield Wednesday continued to pressurise the Middlesbrough defence though and good play by Owls' Player of the Year Lewis Buxton lead to Jermaine Johnson's distance shot just going wide. As the half hour make just passed a corner whipped in by Lewis Buxton was poked into the net by Leroy Lita to double the Owls' advantage and to step them closer to the win that would secure survival. Soon after the second-goal J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan won back the ball from the wide position and put in a clever ball towards Steve Howard to tap into the net, however Howard missed his kick and the ball deflected back off the goalkeeper back into his path, but this time his shot was somehow kept out by a magnificent goal line clearance. Before the half-time whistle was blown Wednesday created another great chance, or at least Danny Pugh did. Pugh took on two-players before firing a shot into the side netting. It could have been at least three or four goals for Sheffield Wednesday by half-time and they should have scored the third early in the second half as a back pass by Middlesbrough went straight to Leroy Lita whose shot was saved well by the opposing goalkeeper. The second half developed into a different game as neither team created many chances but Middlesbrough had the better of the play, a free header from a corner went over the bar and then Grant Leadbitter's long-distance shot went just wide of pulling a goal back for Middlesbrough. Sheffield Wednesday did have the last main chance of the game though when Leroy Lita's header went just wide, but at first the outcome looked terrifying as Lita collided with another player leading to teammates from both teams urgently going to the attention of Lita and calling for the club doctors and physios immediately. However, luckily Leroy Lita soon got up and although was subbed, walked off looking okay. The final whistle eventually came at the end of five-minutes of stoppages, leading to a pitch invasion in celebration of Sheffield Wednesday confirming their place in next season's Football League Championship. Elsewhere, Wolverhampton Wanderers joined Bristol City in next season's League One along with Peterborough United after a last-minute conceded goal saw them go down instead of Barnsley. So far Doncaster Rovers and Bournemouth from League One, and Reading and Queens Park Rangers from the Premier League are confirmed be playing Championship football next season."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Middlesbrough F.C. season", "response": ["| Curtis Main", "| Curtis Main", "|9 February || 1 || Curtis Main ||   || Crystal Palace (A)", "| Curtis Main"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["In their first home game of the new year, Bolton went 2\u20130 down in the first twenty minutes of the game against Middlesbrough.

Alex Baptiste then scored his fourth goal of the season before half-time, and David N'Gog scored in the final minute of normal time to rescue the point for Bolton. In their next game, Bolton were thoroughly beaten by Reading at the Madejski Stadium. Adam Le Fondre scored a first half hat-trick within 33 minutes, before Pavel Pogrebnyak added a fourth after Alex Baptiste handled in the box to concede a penalty.
