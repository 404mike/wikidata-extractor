His works are mainly in watercolour and often plein-air sketches with only a small number of oil paintings being known. He was clearly professionally taught, and was a pupil of Nathaniel Everett Green, who would become his father-in-law.  Green's influence can be seen, particularly in Bomford's early work.  His landscape paintings are characterised by delicate brushwork in a semi-impressionist fashion with excellent perspective and composition, and good contrasts between light and shade. Several still life studies of flowers are known and the odd seascape is also recorded, again primarily in watercolour.  He travelled widely to paint, with works depicting locations throughout England and Wales, with a particular love for South Devon, and North Wales which are represented in many of his works.  There exists a smaller number of pieces from Scotland, and from an overseas excursion to Switzerland and northern Italy in 1906."]}, {"page": "Mary Queen of Scots House", "response": ["The house was recorded in a watercolour by the astronomer and artist Nathaniel Everett Green."]}]}}
