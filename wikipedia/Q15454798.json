She specialises in Renaissance and women's literature, witchcraft and the English Civil War.\nPurkiss was born in Sydney, Australia, and was educated at Roseville College, Our Lady of the Rosary Convent, and Stuartholme School. She received a BA with first class Honours from  the University of Queensland and D.Phil. from Merton College, Oxford. She became lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia in 1991, and lecturer in English at the University of Reading in 1993.  In 1998 she became Professor of English at Exeter University, before taking up her current post at Keble College in 2000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Murray", "response": ["In 1975, the historian Norman Cohn commented that Murray's \"knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of historical method was non-existent\", adding that her ideas were \"firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould\". That same year, the historian of religion Mircea Eliade described Murray's work as \"hopelessly inadequate\", containing \"numberless and appalling errors\". In 1996, the feminist historian Diane Purkiss stated that although Murray's thesis was \"intrinsically improbable\" and commanded \"little or no allegiance within the modern academy\", she felt that male scholars like Thomas, Cohn, and Macfarlane had unfairly adopted an androcentric approach by which they contrasted their own, male and methodologically sound interpretation against Murray's \"feminised belief\" about the witch-cult."]}, {"page": "Fairy", "response": ["One belief held that fairies were spirits of the dead.Lewis (1994) p. 136. This derived from many factors common in various folklore and myths: same or similar tales of both ghosts and fairies; the Irish , origin of their term for fairies, were ancient burial mounds; deemed dangerous to eat food in Fairyland and Hades; the dead and fairies depicted as living underground.Silver (1999) pp. 40\u201341. Diane Purkiss observed an equating of fairies with the untimely dead who left \"unfinished lives\". One tale recounted a man caught by the fairies, who found that whenever he looked steadily at a fairy, it appeared as a dead neighbor of his.Briggs (1967) p. 15. This theory was among the more common traditions related, although many informants also expressed doubts.Briggs (1967) p. 141.", "* Diane Purkiss, Troublesome Things: A History of Fairies and Fairy Stories (Allen Lane, 2000)"]}, {"page": "Isobel Gowdie", "response": ["Gowdie's confessions formed the crux of historian Margaret Murray's thesis about covens consisting of thirteen members; Murray also asserted cults were structured this way throughout Europe although her work was later discredited. Wilby opines there may have been dark shamanic aspects contained in the fairy elements. Despite the Privy Council's April 1662 proclamation, torture was often still employed and Levack speculates some form of it may have been applied to Gowdie; she may have become unbalanced by the imprisonment and lengthy inquisitions. While kept in solitary confinement, she was probably prevented from sleeping and mistreated. Scholars, such as Callow and Diane Purkiss, suggest Gowdie's narratives about sumptuous meals are indicative of a woman who was continually hungry; other details may be evidence of a powerless woman, angry and sexually frustrated by the austerity imposed by the ministers. Church and court records show rape as a recurrent crime during civil unrest and in the mid-16th century; Gowdie described her first carnal experience with the Devil as being in 1647 when soldiers may still have been in the area and Wilby postulates the lurid sexual details may be Gowdie's \"fantasy-response to the trauma of rape.\""]}, {"page": "Sieges of Taunton", "response": ["In his history of Taunton, H. J. Wickenden suggests that over half of the town was burned or destroyed during the three sieges,Wickenden 1947, p. 92. while Diane Purkiss claims that it was as high as two thirds of the town.Purkiss 2006, p. 439. Several compensation payouts were made to the town and some of its residents, funded by fines against those who had fought for the Royalists, such as Sir William Portman, who had been the Member of Parliament for Taunton at the outbreak of the war and was fined \u00a37,000. Although the Parliamentarians destroyed many of the castles that had featured in the Civil War, Taunton Castle was considered a Parliamentarian stronghold, and remained intact. In 1647, only two years after the end of the sieges, the castle was sold as part of the estate of Taunton Manor.Wickenden 1947, pp. 106\u2013107. In 1660, shortly after taking the throne, Charles II stripped Taunton of its town charter for its part in the Civil War, and had the castle's outer walls removed.Wickenden 1947, p. 110."]}, {"page": "Evil Queen", "response": ["The Grimm brothers invented the motif of the Queen's execution at Snow White's wedding; the original story sees her punished by the King. The Grimms noted on the margin of their 1810 manuscript: \"The ending is not quite right and is lacking something.\"Michelle Ann Abate, Bloody Murder: The Homicide Tradition in Children's Literature, page 57.

This motif changed in subsequent versions,Terri Windling, \"Snow, Glass, Apples: the story of Snow White \". after 1819.Cay Dollerup, Tales and Translation: The Grimm Tales from Pan-germanic Narratives to Shared International Fairytales, page 339. The earliest version was known as \"Snow Drop\".Diane Purkiss, The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations, page 278. Jack Zipes said \"the change from 'evil mother' to 'evil stepmother' for example, was because the brothers 'held motherhood sacred'. According to Sheldon Cashdan, Professor of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, a \"cardinal rule of fairy tales\" mandates that the \"heroes and heroines are allowed to kill witches, sorceresses, even stepmothers, but never their own mothers\". Zipes' 2014 collection of Grimm fairy tales in their original forms reinstated the Queen as Snow White's mother."]}, {"page": "People's history", "response": ["*The English Civil War: A People's History by Diane Purkiss (New York: Basic Books, 2006)"]}, {"page": "Roseville College", "response": ["*Diane Purkiss \u2013 Author, Editor, Fellow and Tutor of English at Keble College, Oxford (also attended Our Lady of the Rosary Convent and Stuartholme School)"]}, {"page": "Purkiss", "response": ["*Diane Purkiss (born 1961), British literary historian"]}, {"page": "Sacred Weeds", "response": ["*Dr Diane Purkiss, historian and lecturer at the University of Reading"]}, {"page": "Tobias Druitt", "response": ["Tobias Druitt is an author of fantasy novels.
