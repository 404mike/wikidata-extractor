After completing the album and touring with the band in support of it, Lander died on 11 October 2015.", "In terms of musicality, Allmusic's Fred Thomas told that the release is \"another installment of brilliant pop\". At American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz touched on how \"these songs soar, glide and seem effortless in their innocent simplicity.\" Consequence of Sound's Bryant Kitching felt that \"they\u2019ve honed their brutally honest and quirky take on heartbreak into something they can now wield with delightful precision.\" Andy Gill of The Independent alluded to how \"songwriter Tracyanne Campbell couches harsh, sometimes brutal sentiments in soothing musical surroundings.\" At The Skinny, Chris Buckle highlighted that the release \"conveys a warm familiarity\" that will be repaid with \"many revisits\" to listen to the album. Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine evoked that \"Desire Lines sees Camera Obscura straining harder for complexity; they maintain their famous sweetness while dialing back on some of the stronger melodies\", but this leads to \"their most balanced and monotonous effort to date, with such little distinction between its dozen sleep tracks that it makes ideal background music\", which he called \"sugary but tasteless syrup.\" Drowned in Sound's Jon Clark felt the album was consistent, which he told that \"Desire Lines bears witness to a band that sound at ease with themselves\", and this was accomplished in \"layered with interest, the instruments subtly interweaving with one another to create music that is somehow both complex and simplistic.\" In addition, Clark called this \"polished, luxurious pop\", which contains \"Campbell\u2019s excellent vocal, [and this] makes for a consistently concise, effective and moving record.\" At Paste, Evan Rytlewski noted that \"the result is the purest late-night album that Camera Obscura has recorded yet\". This Is Fake DIY's Gareth Ware found this to be \"literate, swooning pop music in the shape of new long-player 'Desire Lines'.\" At The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski noted that the album \"unlike previous Camera Obscura efforts, its songs aren\u2019t as immediate or arresting\" because it \"has a few sleepy spots\" that \"causes it to drag on occasion.\"", "In the realm of lyrics, Thomas said it has the \"now trademark mixture of heartbreaking and sharply astute lyrical turns guiding the songs through either romantic longing, dour tragedy, or touches of the band's more and more familiar dry sense of humor.\" Horowitz noted that \"her slightly retro, girl group pop features often edgy lyrics that belie the music\u2019s droolingly pretty, perky and persistent melodies.\" The Guardian's Maddy Costa told that \"it's love that's the culprit: love that makes people approaching middle-age gauche as teenagers; love that wraps up heartbreak in happiness \u2013 a contradiction Campbell has long embodied, singing acidic lyrics in a sugary voice golden with optimism.\" Susannah Young of Under the Radar evoked that \"typically, Tracyanne Campbell writes Camera Obscura's lyrics from an omniscient narrator's perspective, but even when she gets more personal, there's still a bit of a guarded tone at play.\" Clark felt that the lyrics are \"thoughtful and sardonic\", which were done with \"a certain tastefulness to this record that is achieved by its potent, thoughtful lyrics that never seem stale or badly written.\" Ware felt that the \"record oozes an elegant stream of sophistication and songwriting\".", "On the subject of production, Thomas called it \"somewhat more clear than previous efforts, relying less on reverb and stuffing the frequency ranges with even more string sections, odd percussion, and pop accents than before.\" Horowitz called the production \"bigger,\" and \"the recording a touch more sophisticated but by and large, it\u2019s all about auteur/lead singer Tracyanne Campbell\u2019s sweet, innocent, succulent vocals.\" Gill told that the album was \"produced in [an] understated manner by Tucker Martine\".
