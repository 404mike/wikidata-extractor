The French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, later questioned Vosmaer's decision to affiliate the animal with sloths, arguing that it was more closely aligned with the lorises of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Bengal.  The word \"loris\" was first used in 1765 by Buffon as a close equivalent to a Dutch name, loeris.  This etymology was later supported by the physician William Baird in the 1820s, who noted that the Dutch word loeris signified \"a clown\"."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish scientists", "response": ["| William Baird"]}, {"page": "William Thompson (naturalist)", "response": ["George Dickie's Flora of Ulster contains records of Thompson's frequent botanical contributions and his Hortus Siccus and he is mentioned in William Baird's Natural History of British Entomostraca."]}, {"page": "William Wing", "response": ["Wing illustrated many zoological and entomological works including John MacGillivray's Narrative of the Voyage of HMS Rattlesnake (2 vols, Boone, London 1852), Synopsis of the Species of Whales and Dolphins in the Collection of the British Museum by John Edward Gray, The Natural History of the British Entomostraca by William Baird and lithography for Albany Hancock's illustrations for A Monograph of the British Nudibranchiate Mollusca."]}, {"page": "Eccles, Scottish Borders", "response": ["* William Baird (physician) (1803-1872), physician and zoologist"]}, {"page": "William Baird", "response": ["William Baird may refer to:", "* William Baird (MP) (1796\u20131864), Conservative MP for Falkirk Burghs", "* William Baird (physician) (1803\u20131872), Scottish physician and zoologist", "* William Baird (footballer) (1874\u2013?), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh", "response": ["* William Baird (1803\u20131872), zoologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| William Baird ||06/06/1867||1803 \u2013 27 January 1872"]}, {"page": "William Baird (zoologist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Baird (physician)"]}, {"page": "Christine Jurine", "response": ["She has been referred to as Jurine's \"accomplished daughter\", who \"faithfully portrayed [the Entomostraca], as seen by the microscope.\" (William Baird, as quoted by Damkaer, 2002)."]}, {"page": "Macrothrix", "response": ["The genus was described in 1843 by William Baird."]}]}}
