Later he returned to Kirkcaldy, working as a hand-loom weaver. In around 1800 he moved to Edinburgh (where his younger brother William was training in the law), and established himself as a draper.\nIn 1816 he helped to finance his brother's new venture, The Scotsman newspaper.\nFollowing his brother's death in 1831, he became much more involved with the newspaper, giving up the drapery business. Within a few years he was the sole proprietor, having bought out the other shareholders. He turned the paper into a daily in 1855, selling at the price of 1d.\nIn 1842, Ritchie's great-nephew John Ritchie Findlay came to live with Ritchie, and entered the business.\nIn addition to his newspaper activities, Ritchie was a town councillor in Edinburgh, a magistrate, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and one of the founders of the United Industrial School.\nOn Ritchie's death in 1881, John Ritchie Findlay succeeded him in the ownership of The Scotsman. They are buried in the same family plot at the south end of \"Lords Row\" on the western wall of Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1778", "response": ["** John Ritchie, British newspaper founder (d. 1870)"]}, {"page": "Dean Cemetery", "response": ["The separated section north of Ravelston Terrace (previously Edgehill NurseryOrdnance Survey 1851 : Edinburgh) was purchased in 1877 in anticipation of a sales rate matching that of the original cemetery, but this was not to be, and the area only began to be used in 1909 (excepting John Ritchie Findlay (1898) alone for a decade).
