During the Crimean War he served as Assistant Adjutant-General of the Cavalry Division, under Lord Lucan, at the Battle of Alma in September 1854, at the Battle of Balaklava in October 1854 and at the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 as well as at the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War. He was then given command of the rear area, including the Bosphorus, Gallipoli and the Dardanelles before returning to England. He later became Commander of the 1st Brigade at Aldershot in 1856, General Officer Commanding South-West District in 1860 and finally Adjutant-General to the Forces in 1865.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan", "response": ["There is no doubt that Cardigan had reached and overrun the enemy battery: he was recognised beyond the guns by Prince Leon Hieronim Radziwi\u0142\u0142 (ru), an enemy officer with whom he was acquainted before the war; Radziwi\u0142\u0142 issued instructions that Cardigan was to be taken prisoner and not killed.On 1 June 1844 Tsar Nicholas I docked at Woolwich on a diplomatic mission to London. Prince Leon Radziwi\u0142\u0142 was one of Nicholas\u2019s aides-de-camp for the duration of the visit and it was during this time that he and Cardigan met. At the time of the Battle of Balaclava, Radziwi\u0142\u0142 had just been promoted to major-general commanding the Uhlan division and, as Kinglake notes, it was in this capacity he again encountered Cardigan.Kinglake (1863) II pp. 534\u2013537. Cardigan, considering his duty then done and disdaining, as he later explained, to \"fight the enemy among private soldiers\", turned about and made his way steadily\u2014he himself said that his return was at the walk to avoid any unseemly appearance of haste\u2014for his own lines. Lord Lucan recalled things differently, later giving evidence that Cardigan had been galloping back, only slowing to walk when he realised he was being watched.David (1997), p. 459. This hurried retreat was also noticed by General Liprandi, Russian commander, who made enquiries to identify the English officer whom he saw galloping away after the attack.Kinglake (1863), II p. 509. Officers and men of the second and third lines\u2014men for whom as brigade commander Cardigan remained responsible\u2014were still advancing at the charge when they saw their commander riding in retreat.David (1997), p. 407. Lord George Paget of the 4th Hussars later declared that Cardigan alone could issue the required orders when the time came to break off the engagement and some needless fighting, hand-to-hand and intense against great odds, could thus have been avoided. Other officers too had noticed his absence: one, Lord William Paulet on Lucan's staff, had noticed Cardigan \"riding like a madman\" towards the rear. When Colonel Paget, one of the last to return, encountered a \"composed\" Cardigan, he challenged him to account for himself. Unsatisfied with the response, Paget wrote an official complaint to the new Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge.Woodham-Smith (1953), pp. 240\u2014250. Cambridge forwarded the letter to Cardigan for comment and Cardigan's reply in turn complained that Paget had not in fact taken the part he claimed during the attack that day.Thomas (1974) p. 288 quotes from Cardigan's letter: \"I never can admit that [Paget] led [the] second line into action on that day.\". Inconclusive claim and counter-claim followed, until Cardigan's attentions were diverted to the allegations made public when Calthorpe's book Letters went on sale.David (1997), p. 453"]}, {"page": "Battle of Balaclava", "response": ["In accordance with his usual practice Lucan had gone forward at daybreak to inspect the redoubts and outposts, accompanied by his staff: Lord George Paget, Lord William Paulet, and Major Thomas McMahon.
