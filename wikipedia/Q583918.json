However, in the absence of proof to support his claim, he withdrew his proposal in 1939. Abel Chapman considered it a colour morph of the normally spotted cheetah.

Consequently, it was visited by British naturalists and hunters including Abel Chapman and Walter J. Buck, both of whom wrote books that alerted a wider audience in Europe to the strategic importance of Do\u00f1ana for migratory birds traveling to Africa. Later, when Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Caro (1865-1915) became the 19th Duke of Medina Sidonia, he inherited large debts and to pay them was forced to sell off various assets, including the Coto de Do\u00f1ana, which he sold for 750,000 pesetas, finally detaching it from the noble house."]}, {"page": "Kruger National Park", "response": ["Before the Second Anglo-Boer War, the area now covered by the park was a remote section of the eastern South African Republic's last wild frontier.

James Stevenson Hamilton noted many kraals along the Sabi River and also further north beyond the Letaba River although the north was sparsely populated compared to the south. Many of the local natives were employed by railway companies for construction of rail connections, notably that between Pretoria (now in South Africa) and Loren\u00e7o Marques (now Maputo, Mozambique) during the end of the 19th century.

In August 1901 he is recorded as visiting his old friend Frederick Jackson, now Acting Commissioner of Uganda in Entebbe. and that his intention was to head north to hunt near the Abyssinian border. In fact Neumann probably returned shortly after to Britain as he is recorded buying a large-bore, double barrelled rifle from the Southwark gunsmith John Rigby & Company whilst staying at the Union Club. He was present at a Norfolk shooting party in late 1901 that was attended by several notable hunters of the period including Frederick Selous and J.G.
