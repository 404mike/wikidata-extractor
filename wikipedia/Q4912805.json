A prolific goalscorer with a touch of class, Billy soon emphasised his impact with the Lurgan Blues by scoring a hat-trick in a league match against Bangor that clinched the 1959\u201360 Irish League title. Over the next few seasons Billy's goal tally and reputation grew, and he scored 4 goals when the Irish League Select played the Italian League Select at Windsor Park in 1962, in a 6\u20132 victory. He then picked up his full Northern Ireland international cap in a match against Wales, just after his 20th birthday.In June 1966, then manager of Oldham Athletic, Jimmy McIlroy, signed him for \u00a310,000, and he also scored his first international goal in a 4\u20131 victory over Mexico at Windsor Park just before the 1966 World Cup. Unfortunately for Billy, he picked up a serious ankle injury just 4 weeks into his Football League career, that forced him to retire at the age of just 26.During the 1971\u201372 season, he took over the reins at Crusaders, winning the league title in 1972\u201373 and 1975\u201376, leading the club to famous ties against the likes of Dinamo Bucharest and Liverpool.A few years after that second title he went on to manage Ballymena United and Glentoran, where he also won a league championship, before retiring from management.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stranmillis University College", "response": ["* Billy Johnston; former Northern Ireland football (soccer) international"]}, {"page": "Glentoran F.C.", "response": ["* Billy Johnston (1985\u201387)"]}, {"page": "Ballymena United F.C.", "response": ["Former favourite from the 1958 side Eddie Russell became player-manager and scored as United won the County Antrim Shield for the first time in 25 years \u2013 beating Distillery 4\u20130 at Inver Park.

Todd was replaced with Billy Johnston in early 1971, and he set about restructuring the squad. Under Johnston unprecedented success was to follow, with the Irish League championship trophy finding a home at Seaview in 1972\u201373, with the attacking duo of Tommy Finney and Jackie Fullerton scoring 47 goals between them. The club also set a record of going through the whole league campaign unbeaten at home, a feat which was repeated 40 years later in the 2012\u201313 season. This led to the club's first ever participation in the European Cup, in which they faced Dinamo Bucharest and had the misfortune of setting the record for a defeat in that competition, losing 0\u201311 in the away leg on 3 October 1973.", "| Billy Johnston"]}, {"page": "Bangor F.C.", "response": ["| Billy Johnston"]}, {"page": "Bill Johnston", "response": ["Bill or Billy Johnston may refer to:", "* Billy Johnston (footballer, born 1901) (1901\u20131964), Scottish football player", "* Billy Johnston (footballer, born 1942), Irish football player and manager"]}]}}
