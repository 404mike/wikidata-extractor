At that time, smallpox was a dreaded disease and many princes and princesses were becoming infected around Europe. Near two years old, Alfred became ill after his inoculation against the smallpox virus; his early death at the age of nearly two, along with the demise of his brother Prince Octavius six months later, was a complete shock to their parents as both children were healthy. In his later bouts of madness, King George would have imagined conversations with both of his youngest sons.", "link_mentions": []}}
