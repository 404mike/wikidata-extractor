He was sold on to First Division club Stoke City for \u00a3262,000 in 1980. He spent four season at the Victoria Ground and made his most telling contribution in his last match for the club, scoring all the goals in a 4\u20130 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on the final day of the 1983\u201384 season. He spent 1984\u201385 in the United States with the Tacoma Stars, before joining Port Vale in June 1985.

His brother also made the switch later in the season. Asked if this move caused him to receive any \"stick\" from his friends, he replied: \"No not really. Mind you I wouldn't, I didn't really have any mates.\" He proved to be a good signing for manager Richie Barker, and got the better of Arsenal's left-back Kenny Sansom. He replaced Paul Maguire on the left-wing and scored six goals in 39 appearances in 1982\u201383 as the \"Potters\" finished 13th in the First Division. Chamberlain scored seven goals in 46 games in 1983\u201384, helping the club to avoid relegation by two places and two points. However, he scored just twice in 32 appearances in 1984\u201385, as Stoke finished bottom of the division with a mere 17 points; they won just three of their 42 games and were 23 points short of safety.
