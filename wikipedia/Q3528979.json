Kent batted first and posted a total of 239 for eight, aided by scores of 66 from both Colin Cowdrey and Brian Luckhurst. During Essex's reply, Norman Graham bowled well to take four wickets and restrict the opposing batsmen to 19 runs from his 12 overs, helping Kent to a 42-run victory. In their quarter-final match against Surrey, Alan Dixon took seven wickets for 15 runs, while Graham and John Shepherd also bowled economically to bowl Surrey out for 74 runs. Writing for The Times, A. A. Thomson opined that although Dixon's bowling was \"magnificent\", the opposition batting was equally poor. In a facile chase, Kent lost four wickets, but reached their winning total in less than half the available overs to win by six wickets. In their semi final against Sussex, good batting performances from Luckhurst, Shepherd and Cowdrey helped Kent to a total of 293 for five. In response, Sussex were bowled out for 175. The wickets were shared amongst the Kent bowlers, but Alan Brown and Derek Underwood were particularly miserly.", "Played in front of a sell-out crowd of 20,000 people at Lord's, Kent captain Colin Cowdrey won the toss and chose to bat first. Mike Denness and Brian Luckhurst opened the batting for Kent. Denness began by scoring quickly, accounting for 50 of the team's 78 runs after just over an hour of the match, before being caught behind by Geoff Clayton off the bowling of Bill Alley. John Woodcock, writing in The Times described Denness' contribution as being \"the one innings of quality\" in an \"ordinary\" match. Luckhurst played a patient innings, and shared a second-wicket partnership of 60 with Shepherd. Once their top-order batsmen were out, Kent collapsed from 138 runs for the loss of one wicket to 150 for seven. Cowdrey, Dixon, Stuart Leary and Alan Brown were all dismissed for scores of one or less. A late partnership between Alan Knott and Alan Ealham, who scored 21 and 17 respectively before both were run out, helped to push Kent's score on to 193 all out after 59.4 overs, two deliveries short of the full 60-over innings. Somerset's bowling was led by Alley, who took three wickets and conceded 22 runs from his 12 overs. Woodcock described his bowling during the match as being of \"the utmost cunning\". Somerset's other bowlers fared less well; Roy Palmer also collected three wickets, but was expensive, conceding nearly five runs per over.", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Alan Brown", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Alan Brown b John Shepherd || 8", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Alan Knott  b Alan Brown || 27", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Alan Brown "]}]}}
