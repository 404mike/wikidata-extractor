However, he did not play on The Reptile House EP. Subsequently, the band signed to WEA and Ben Gunn quit in disgust, claiming personal differences between himself and Eldritch (the same reason as was later stated when Gary Marx, Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams left between 1984 and 1985). He claimed that the Sisters started as a joke on rock outfits, and now they had become one.He later played in a band named Torch, and afterwards formed Anabas (on his own label 'Flame On'), releasing two singles under this banner. Whilst in bands he often would not allow himself to be photographed by interviewers.\nFollowing the lack of success for his post-Sisters of Mercy projects, Matthews left the music industry.

Later in 1981, Ben Gunn was recruited as the Sisters' second guitarist. Eldritch's melancholic baritone, Craig Adams's pulsating bass, Doktor Avalanche's beat and Marx's flowing guitar led the band to early underground success.

The gig was followed by a short American tour until 16 April.
