In their formative years, McLaren built Formula Two, hillclimbing, Formula 5000 and sports racing cars that were sold to customers. Lacking the capacity to build the desired numbers, Trojan was subcontracted to construct some of them. In Can-Am, Trojan built customer versions of the M6 and M8 cars and ex-works cars were sold to privateers when new models arrived; half of the field was McLarens at some races. Author Mark Hughes says, \"over 220\" McLarens were built by Trojan. In USAC competition and Formula One, too, many teams used McLarens during the late 1960s and 1970s. A 1972 M8F was rebuilt as the C8 for use in Group C racing in 1982, but had little success."]}, {"page": "Jenson Button", "response": ["Button has a smooth driving style; journalist Mark Hughes wrote in 2009, \"Button has a fantastic feel for how much momentum can be taken into a corner and this allows him to be minimal in his inputs\u2014his steering and throttle movements in particular tend to be graceful and beautifully co-ordinated.\" This allows him to perform well in wet-weather where the front of the car tends to slide more than the rear, and many believe his smooth style better preserves the tyres during a race. He adapted his style in go-karts and transferred it to more powerful machinery. Since 2000, Button has braked with his left foot, by dragging the brake pedal and stopping the car in less time to control and modulate power. He likes to turn into a corner early under braking and balance the car on pedal application and steering, creating more strain in tyre loads for a longer physical lap but allowing for a higher minimum corner entry speed and allowing Button to adapt to a changeable or slippery track."]}, {"page": "Tommy Byrne (racing driver)", "response": ["He co-authored a book with Mark Hughes which was released in the UK on 8 August 2008, titled Crashed and Byrned: The Greatest Racing Driver You Never Saw.

Massa in particular was praised for his performance. The Ferrari team principal, Stefano Domenicali, said it was, \"the best race of his career. It was fantastic the way he managed the race.\" Journalist Mark Hughes described it as \"almost certainly his best race to date\", and colleague Simon Arron termed it as \"one of the finest afternoons of his F1 career\". Both drew attention to his controlled aggression at the first corner of the race, followed by his relentless, mistake-free pace. Arron, in particular, noted that Massa's first-corner passing move was more typical of Hamilton's attacking style than his own, and was a \"defining moment\" in Massa's championship campaign. Hamilton himself later expressed surprise that Massa had been able to overtake him in such a manner, and warned his rival that \"it won't happen again\". Hughes described the Grand Prix as \"a throwback race\", in that the leaders had suffered from unreliability, and the winner had not been in contention on speed alone; It was a situation reminiscent of earlier times in the sport, when the cars were generally less reliable."]}, {"page": "Motor Sport (magazine)", "response": ["* Mark Hughes, Grand Prix Editor (current)"]}, {"page": "British Sports Book Awards", "response": ["*2006   Speed Addicts: Grand Prix Racing \u2013 Mark Hughes (Collins Willow)"]}, {"page": "William Hill Irish Sports Book of the Year", "response": ["* 2008 Crashed And Byrned: The Greatest Racing Driver You Never Saw, Tommy Byrne with Mark Hughes"]}, {"page": "Mark Hughes (motorsport)", "response": ["Mark Hughes has worked in professional motorsport for over 20 years having started in the UK with rallying before moving to circuit racing and circuit operations.", "*Article concerning Mark Hughes move to Abu Dhabi"]}, {"page": "2015 Belgian Grand Prix", "response": ["Max Verstappen received particular praise for his overtake on Felipe Nasr through Blanchimont.
