The letters and Motion's biography fuelled further assessments of this kind, such as Lisa Jardine's comment in The Guardian that \"The Britishness of Larkin's poetry carries a baggage of attitudes which the Selected Letters now make explicit\". On the other hand, the revelations were dismissed by the novelist Martin Amis in The War Against Clich\u00e9, arguing that the letters in particular show nothing more than a tendency for Larkin to tailor his words according to the recipient. A similar argument was made by Richard Bradford in his biography on Larkin from 2005.Bradford 2005, pp. 210 & 224.Motion 1993, p. 332.
