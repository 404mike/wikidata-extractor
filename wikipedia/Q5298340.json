Dent (1956), p. 24. This digest of European press coverage was exclusive to the Magazine, and gave it disproportionate influence in political circles. For example, Robert Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn, used the Notes from the foreign press to advocate to the Marquess of Lansdowne in 1916 against bellicose claims and attitudes on the British side.", "During 1917 the Magazine came under heavy criticism, with its neutral use of foreign press extracts being called pacifism, particularly by the pro-war patriotic Fight for Right Movement headed by Francis Younghusband. Dorothy Buxton's husband Charles Roden Buxton was closely associated with the Union of Democratic Control. Sir Frederick Pollock who chaired Fight for Right wrote to The Morning Post in February 1917 charging the Magazine with pacifist propaganda, and with playing on its connection with the University as if it had official status.C. K. Ogden: A Collective Memoir, p. 38. Gilbert Murray, a supporter of Fight for Right but also a defender of many conscientious objectors and the freedom of the press, intervened to protest, gaining support from Bennett and Hardy.Duncan Wilson, Gilbert Murray (1987), p. 236. John George Butcher, Conservative Member of Parliament for the City of York, asked a question in Parliament about government advertising in the Magazine, during November 1917.

Golden was appointed general secretary of Save the Children Fund, which had been founded in May 1919 to alleviate child starvation in post-war Europe. As the Fund's first general secretary, he worked closely with its founders, Dorothy Buxton and Eglantyne Jebb, who recruited him with a view to establishing the charity on sustainable, business-like foundations. As a salaried member of staff, he took on work which Buxton had been undertaking on a voluntary basis. Whilst Jebb took responsibility for the organisation's policy and overall vision, Golden, with his managerial background, was relied upon to run the administrative side. Golden drove forward the Fund's publicity and fundraising agenda, by taking the innovative step of taking out full-page advertisements in daily newspapers. His particular achievement was the organisation of the Russian famine relief operation in 1921\u20131922. Despite criticism from those who believed that the severity of the famine was exaggerated, and those opposed to the feeding of \"Soviet\" children, the campaign was a success, with Save the Children Fund distributing over 121\u00a0million children's meals."]}]}}
