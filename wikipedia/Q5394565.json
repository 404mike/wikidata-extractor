According to the wing-half Joe Mallett, Ramsey was also motivated to leave by a dressing-room row with his captain Bill Rochford at half-time during that final league match against Sheffield Wednesday: one of the Sheffield Wednesday goals was blamed on Ramsey's failure to play an opposing winger offside. The Southampton chairman and board tried to persuade Ramsey to stay, but his mind was made up\u2014he told them that if he played in the reserve team it would hinder his chances of playing internationally. Liverpool, Luton Town and Burnley were among the clubs who expressed interest in buying him but by the time of the transfer deadline on 16 March only Sheffield Wednesday had made an official bid. Tottenham Hotspur came in with a last-minute offer, but there was no time for the transfer to go through, and Ramsey was forced to stay at Southampton for the rest of the season.

The group all attended the same school and played football at the local park, using a tennis ball, as no local family could afford a football at the time. Nurse was active in numerous sports, taking part in long-jump and javelin as well as captaining his school's football and cricket teams. At the age of 14, he was selected to play for the Swansea schoolboys team and played matches for the side at Vetch Field. The following year, he was selected to play for Wales' schoolboys and played in a 3\u20133 draw with England at Wembley Stadium, the opposition side containing Bobby Charlton and Wilf McGuinness. Outside football, Nurse was also a keen carpenter and briefly worked as an apprentice for a local carpenter before his football career progressed."]}, {"page": "Ernie Jones", "response": ["Ernie Jones may refer to:", "*Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman) (1869\u20131943), Australian cricketer and Australian rules footballer", "*Ernie Jones (wide receiver) (born 1964), American football player", "*Ernie Jones (defensive back) (born 1953), American football player", "*Ernie Jones (footballer, born 1920) (1920\u20132002), Welsh footballer", "*Ernie Jones (footballer, born 1919) (1919\u20132011), footballer for Chester City", "*Ernie Jones (golfer) (1932\u20132019), Irish golfer"]}, {"page": "Syd Thomas", "response": ["When the Football League resumed in 1946, Thomas made his professional debut for Fulham eight years after originally signing with the club, playing in a draw with Tottenham Hotspur in November 1946.
