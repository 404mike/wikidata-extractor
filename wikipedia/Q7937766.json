Millington notes that \"Ionic became a distinct design in its own right\" while Hoefler comments that it is now \"chiefly associated with bracketed faces of the Century model\". A decline of interest in Clarendons for display use did, however, take place in the early twentieth century: by 1923, American Type Founders, which specialised in creating demand for new designs of display face, could argue \"Who remembers the Clarendons[?]\" in its specimen book, and did not show them (aside from some numerals) in its 1,148 pages. In addition, the market of slab serifs was disrupted by the arrival of new \"geometric\" slab-serifs inspired by the sans-serifs of the period, such as Beton and Memphis. However, a revival of interest did appear after the war both in America and Europe: Vivian Ridler commented that \"What seemed pestiferous thirty years ago is now regarded as rugged, virile and essential for an advertising agency's self-respect.\""]}, {"page": "Perpetua (typeface)", "response": ["Perpetua's appeal to fine book printers has been long-standing since its release, both in the UK and abroad. Christopher Sandford wrote of Perpetua and Gill\u2019s similar type for the Golden Cockerel Press that \u201cit is important that type in combination with finely cut engravings should not be so \u2018bold\u2019 as to 'kill' the artists' work, it is also important that it should not be too light to make a comfortable combination. While Gill's Perpetua is probably better suited to combine with line-engravings in copper, etchings, mezzotints or watercolour paintings, the [somewhat bolder] 'Golden Cockerel' type undoubtedly fulfilled Gill's intention for it to combine most charmingly with surface printing from wood-blocks.\" Vivian Ridler, some years later to become Printer to the University of Oxford, was so inspired by Gill's work around this time that he named his side printing project the Perpetua Press after the font in 1933. OUP book designer Hugh Williamson, in his Methods of Book Design (1956), however warned that Perpetua's 12 pt size was smaller than \"any other series now in general use\" but commented that Gill had proven that \"the design of alphabets for printing has further achievements to offer to artists of the stature to reach them.\""]}, {"page": "Joanna (typeface)", "response": ["All the Monotype versions are somewhat different to the original Caslon type made for Gill, that used in the first edition of An Essay on Typography (historian James Mosley considers it as superior to Monotype's, and Vivian Ridler also felt the Monotype version in some ways less characterful than the metal), and Jones described his goal as being to compromise between the different versions \"to create a version of Joanna that appears in your mind when you think of Joanna.\""]}, {"page": "1913 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 2 October \u2013 Vivian Ridler, printer and typographer (died 2009)"]}, {"page": "1913 in Wales", "response": ["*2 October - Vivian Ridler, printer (died 2009) "]}, {"page": "2009 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Vivian Ridler, printer and typographer (b. 1913)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2009", "response": ["*Vivian Ridler, 95, British printer."]}, {"page": "Ridler", "response": ["*Vivian Ridler (1913\u20132009), English printer, typographer and scholar"]}, {"page": "Perpetua Press", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vivian Ridler"]}, {"page": "List of Sephardic prayer books", "response": ["*Book of Prayer of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Congregation, London (5 vols.): Oxford (Oxford University Press, Vivian Ridler), 5725 - 1965 (Hebrew and English; since reprinted)"]}]}}
