The fight was supposed to be on the preliminary part of the event, but a last minute illness to main card fighter Alessio Sakara moved the bout to the main card. Ludwig scored with strikes, including multiple grazing headkicks in the first round until Osipczak landed a combination, buckling the veteran. The round ended with Osipczak landing ground and pound from the top, bloodying Ludwig. The second round was pretty even with mixed striking exchanges and takedown attempts. The third round saw Ludwig land a big left early on and basically stalk Osipczak the rest of the round, scoring but failing to finish as Osipczak was seemingly out on his feet, walking away from exchanges and covering up. The bout was Ludwig's first since an eight-month recovery from a severe leg injury.
