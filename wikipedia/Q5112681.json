He was inspired by a 1917 book he had read, The Hindu History by Akshay Majumdar, which wrote about an alternate history of India by combining legends and mythology. Doyle was also intrigued by the Indian epic Mahabharata which translated into \"this is what happened\". He thought about the basis of the epic in history and science and moved forward with his writing.
