As Speroni continued to play understudy to Kir\u00e1ly, he found himself competing with new signing Scott Flinders over a spot in the substitute bench, as well as facing his own injury concern. It was not until on 16 December 2006 when Speroni made his first appearance of the season, in a 1\u20130 loss against Derby County. This was followed up by keeping his first clean sheet for the club, in a 1\u20130 win against Sunderland. After the match, newspaper Your Local Guardian praised his performance, saying: \"he instilled confidence in his defence, made some crucial saves and kept a clean sheet\". After Kir\u00e1ly was dropped from the first team, manager Peter Taylor announced that Speroni would be stepping in as his replacement. He made his first appearance for Crystal Palace in four months, as the club lost 2\u20130 against Barnsley on 21 April 2007. Speroni started the remaining two matches of the 2006\u201307 season, helping Crystal Palace keep two clean sheets. Manager Taylor revealed that he is planning to use him as the club's first choice goalkeeper next season and have no intention of signing a new goalkeeper.

After spending a period of pre-season with the club in 2009 he finally signed following the lifting of the club's transfer embargo. Lovell's contract came to an end after the 2010\u201311 campaign, but was offered a further year plus one-year option by Cherries boss, Lee Bradbury, and put pen to paper on 25 May 2011 keeping him at Bournemouth until at least May 2012. Lovell had struggled to overcome an ankle injury and only returned to the squad in April 2011 but showed enough quality to merit a new deal. On 1 September 2011, Lovell announced his retirement from professional football with immediate effect after struggling with injuries for the past two seasons. Lovell scored four goals during his second spell at Bournemouth. His first goal came against Hartlepool in the league, a game in which Bournemouth confirmed their spot in the 2010\u201311 play offs despite conceding an injury time goal scored by Hartlepool goalkeeper Scott Flinders. However, his two goals against Huddersfield in the play off semi final second leg were unable to prevent them from losing on penalties.
