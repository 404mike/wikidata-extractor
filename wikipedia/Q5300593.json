Gibson is critical of Robins's efforts to replace Hutton as captain in 1954, an action which Wilde describes as \"disloyal and unhelpful\". It seems that Robins was not particularly popular with the players of a later generation, and that he made little effort to understand them. According to Wilde, Robins failed to recognise the extent to which, in the postwar era, international cricket had changed from his own heyday in the 1930s. It had, says Wilde, become much more tough and attritional, hence Robins's repeated calls for more attacking, brighter cricket were often inappropriate and doomed to failure."]}, {"page": "Essex County Cricket Club", "response": ["After World War II Essex fell off, taking their first wooden spoon in 1950.
