His style features lifelike drawings of British wildlife, in cartoon-like situations. Ostensibly produced for children, they include sufficient visual puns to be of interest to adults. He first worked as a technical illustrator for Hawker Siddeley and also illustrated album sleeves, not least for guitarist Anthony Phillips and over 200 designs in the popular Harbottle Hamster range of greetings cards for Gordon Fraser.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anthony Phillips", "response": ["Several of his albums feature artwork by Peter Cross."]}, {"page": "Peter Cross", "response": ["Peter Cross may refer to:", "* Peter Cross (illustrator) (born 1951), British illustrator", "* Peter Cross (engraver) (1815\u20131862), American engraver", "* Peter Cross (rugby union), English rugby mascot", "* Pierre Cressoy (1924\u20131980) is an actor credited as Peter Cross"]}, {"page": "Private Parts and Pieces VI: Ivory Moon", "response": ["The album's cover painting is a work entitled Sea-Dogs Motoring by Peter Cross, who had designed the sleeves for many of Phillips's previous albums. The painting is based on Leith Hill Tower in Dorking. The back cover features a photograph of Phillips taken by Cross in 1985 during a cricket game at Hambledon, Hampshire. As per most of Phillips albums, the liner notes to Ivory Moon contain a running joke reference to Phillips's friend Ralph Bernascone: \"Ralph Bernascone appears courtesy of Ravaged Records\".

Instead, the change in style of music is represented in the sleeve design, replacing the more detailed, fantasy-inspired, and hand drawn illustrations for a dark and more minimalist feel designed by Under the Stairs Productions. Phillips felt Cross's style would not have fit the musical direction of the album. The cover depicts an open small cage with a black background, a reference to the cage affixed to the head of Winston Smith, the protagonist in Nineteen Eighty-Four when he is taken to Room 101.

Perry on bass, the three rehearsed them for one week at Giles's home studio in Dorset, and recorded the developed tracks onto 4-track tape. After Phillips secured a deal with Arista Records, the original plan was for Wise After the Event to be released as an album with an accompanying EP of extra material. Artist Peter Cross began to design the cover art when the decision was made, but when the decision was made to scrap the EP Cross had moved onto other projects and there was insufficient time to correct his design, resulting in discrepancies with the running order of the tracks.

Phillips received assistance from his friend Dennis Quinn in naming many of the tracks on the album, having played the demo versions to him. Previous albums by Phillips included the artwork of English author and illustrator Peter Cross, but he was unavailable to produce for A Catch at the Tables due to other projects.

Upon discussions with illustrator Peter Cross on cover designs, they looked ways of reintroducing a figure with a kit bag that Cross had drawn on the cover for Private Parts & Pieces (1978). In a departure from the norm, Cross had to complete a design before the music was completed and discussions between them about the American War of Independence had the region of New England come up.
