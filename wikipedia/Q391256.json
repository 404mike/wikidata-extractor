Petitions for justice were normally addressed to the king and the curia, but in 1280, Edward I instructed his justices to examine and deal with petitions themselves as the Court of King's Bench.  Important petitions were to be sent to the lord chancellor for his decision; the more significant of these were also to be brought to the king's attention. By the reign of Edward III, this chancellery function developed into a separate tribunal for the lord chancellor. In this body, which became known as the High Court of Chancery, the lord chancellor would determine cases according to fairness (or \"equity\") instead of according to the strict principles of common law.  The lord chancellor also became known as the \"keeper of the king's conscience\". Churchmen continued to dominate the chancellorship until the 16th century.  In 1529, after Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who was lord chancellor and archbishop of York, was dismissed for failing to procure the annulment of Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, laymen tended to be more favoured for appointment to the office. Ecclesiastics made a brief return during the reign of Mary I, but thereafter, almost all lord chancellors have been laymen. Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (1672\u201373) was the last lord chancellor who was not a lawyer, until the appointment of Chris Grayling in 2012. The three subsequent holders of the position, Michael Gove (2015\u201316), Elizabeth Truss (2016\u20132017) and David Lidington (2017\u20132018) are also not lawyers. However, the appointment of David Gauke in January 2018 meant that once again the lord chancellor was a lawyer."]}, {"page": "Chief Secretary to the Treasury", "response": ["| David GaukeMP for South West Hertfordshire"]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Work and Pensions", "response": ["|David Gauke"]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Justice", "response": ["In the Cabinet reshuffle of August 2012 Chris Grayling was promoted to Lord Chancellor, and, by convention, Secretary of State for Justice.
