He also began the violin. In his twelfth year he was introduced by Carrington to the Revd Richard Eastcott of Exeter, a well-known amateur, who afterwards, in his Sketches of the Origin, Progress, and Effects of Music (Bath, 1793), gave some account of Davy's extraordinary musical faculties. Eastcott recommended his friends to article him to William Jackson, the organist of Exeter Cathedral. Davy's progress in the study of composition was rapid, and he soon became a capable performer on the organ, violin, viola, and cello."]}]}}
