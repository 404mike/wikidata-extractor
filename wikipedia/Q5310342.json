Set in present-day rural England, the film presents a multi-narrative tale following the young and old on their journeys of withdrawal and commitment to each other.", "Other critics drew visual and thematic connections to Romanticism, noting imagery \"reminiscent of Gainsborough or Constable \u2013 to grandiloquent, tempestuous shots evoking Caspar David Friedrich, and the bold style of other late Romantics\". Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i is similarly referenced, as well as \"the film\u2019s most vivid and direct quotation \u2013 that of Henry Wallis\u2019 Chatterton\". Much was made of the film's perceived stylistic innovations that moved away from the traditional British Social Realist modes of Loach or Leigh whilst still rendering avowedly realist characters and subject matter. With Better Things Hopkins was positioned as part of a 'British New Wave' of directors, alongside Steve McQueen and others, demonstrating that there was a 'new generation of British cinema coming to the boil'. This thread was later taken up in New Cinemas: Journal of Contemporary Film, with a detailed analysis of contemporary British realist cinema that used Better Things as a point of entry in discussing how 'the likes of Hopkins, Andrea Arnold and Lynne Ramsay can be seen to adopt an approach that places a greater emphasis on the poetic potentials of realist imagery at the expense of social-political didacticism'.http://www.atypon-link.com/INT/doi/abs/10.1386/ncin.8.1.31_1 Other critics found a strong vein of social intent in the film and emphasised its uncommon vision of life in present day rural communities; in hailing a 'steelily impressive debut' the Radio Times stated that \"Duane Hopkins's first feature is a compelling and highly credible insight into the deterioration of life in rural Britain\".http://www.radiotimes.com/servlet_film/com.icl.beeb.rtfilms.client.simpleSearchServlet?frn=48244&searchTypeSelect=5 Better Things won several awards and nominations internationally following its premiere at Cannes, including the FIPRESCI Critics Award for Best Film at Stockholm International Film Festival."]}, {"page": "New unreviewed article/Duane Hopkins", "response": ["#REDIRECT Duane Hopkins"]}, {"page": "Michael Socha", "response": ["In 2008, he was cast in Kenneth Glenaan's BAFTA Scotland-award winning film Summer, where he acted opposite Robert Carlyle.
