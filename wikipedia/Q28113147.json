This version is an initially unpowered-Black British man, nicknamed \"Ches\", who fell in love with an Empath from Ikthanol named Fiona Byrne (portrayed by Tiya Sircar); she describes him as \"a man who goes into a gunfight with a knife and still wins\". In \"Ahimsa\", Manchester worked with Martian Manhunter to find Fiona after she was captured by the Children of Liberty. When they find a badly-wounded Fiona in Mercy Graves and Otis Graves' van, Manchester had his final moments with a dying Fiona as Martian Manhunter tries to take away her pain. Following Fiona's death, Manchester went to buy guns in order to get revenge on those responsible for Fiona's death. In the episode \"Call to Action\", Manchester begins his revenge by targeting some members of the Children of Liberty. After shooting most of them, Manchester interrogated a surviving member on the identity of his supervisor. After getting the name of Caldwell from the Children of Liberty member, Manchester shoots him. Later, in \"Rather the Fallen Angel\", Manchester helps Jimmy Olsen fight the Children of Liberty. Afterwards, he goes after Ben Lockwood. In \"Bunker Hill\", Manchester makes use of the Lockwood Factory to confront Ben in his Agent Liberty alias where Manchester has his wife Lydia as a hostage. Despite some obstacles, Supergirl and Nia Nal thwart Manchester's attempts and Agent Liberty taking revenge. Both Manchester and Ben are arrested by the police. After being visited by Martian Manhunter at National City Men's Central Jail, Manchester watches from the windows as Ben is brought into the prison as the protesters chant \"Liberty\". In \"Menagerie\", Manchester sends Menagerie a letter that pleases her. In \"What's So Funny About Truth, Justice and the American Way?\", Manchester, now with dyed purple hair like his comic counterpart, escapes from prison and forms the Elite with Menagerie, a fifth-dimensional alien named Hat, and an unnamed Morae/Mo. They form the Elite in response to the bigotry of Agent Liberty and the Children of Liberty as well as the ineffectiveness of the government and D.E.O.. They attempt to use an military satellite from space to destroy the White House in the military base, but they were prevented by Supergirl and her allies. In \"Stand and Deliver\", after Menagerie was found and arrested by Supergirl and Nia Nal, Black and Hat want to make pro-alien rally, despite their initial disagreements, against Ben Lockwood and his supporters in anti-alien rally. Both sides go into the conflict, where during the battle J'onn J'onzz tries to defeat him, but he escapes from the scene. His colleague Hat is defeated and arrested. In the episode \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\", Black uses a rare Martian artifact that grants telepathic powers to its user called the Staff of H'ronmeer, using it to mentally torture J'onn and to destroy the dam to flood National City. When he tries to make a flood, Black is killed by a vengeful J'onn J'onzz after the latter believed that he was the one who shot Olsen, disintegrating Manchester, who, in his last moments, found J'onn's unleashed rage \"beautiful\"."]}, {"page": "The Elite (DC Comics)", "response": ["* The Elite appeared in the fourth season of Supergirl with Manchester Black portrayed by David Ajala, Menagerie portrayed by Jessica Merez, and Hat portrayed by Louis Ozawa Changchien.

Manchester recruits Menagerie and Hat while in jail and they break out alongside the unnamed Morae. Believing that the government can\u2019t be trusted and superheroes will not stop killers who don\u2019t share their principles, they set out to kill the Children of Liberty and anyone else who would harm earthbound aliens, daring Supergirl to challenge them. They steal Brainiac 5's Legion Ring for Manchester Black and attempt to have the Claymore satellite - originally created to destroy alien ships within Earth's vicinity - fire at the White House. Menagerie is captured before an assassination attempt on Lockwood and the remaining members steal equipment from the Fortress of Solitude which they use to incite violence at a peaceful alien protest against an anti-alien rally. Supergirl and her friends are able to defeat and arrest Mo and Hat.
