The world wasn't changed, it was remade.\" Mark Glanville wrote in The Times Literary Supplement: \"Lebrecht's book is an extended meditation on the question of what it is about Jews that has enabled them to change the world in so many different ways. He guides us through his chosen period (1847\u20131947) in a breathless present continuous, with an enthusiasm that holds the reader's attention. Besides major, familiar figures, such as Einstein, Freud, Marx, Proust and Schoenberg, his kaleidoscope of characters includes Rosalind Franklin, whose important work on the double helix has still not been fully recognized; Leo Szilard, who split the atom; and Albert Ballin, to whom Lebrecht attributes the invention of the hamburger.\"\"Bottled energies\" by Mark Glanville, The Times Literary Supplement, 28 February 2020"]}, {"page": "Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize", "response": ["* Mark Glanville, The Goldberg Variations: From Football Hooligan to Opera Singer (Flamingo)"]}, {"page": "Pro Musica Hebraica", "response": ["* Mark Glanville"]}, {"page": "1988 Great Britain Lions tour", "response": ["|LK ||8||Mark Glanville"]}, {"page": "Glanville, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Glanville"]}]}}
