His Autobiography, an abstract of the Diary, to 3 September 1695, was edited (1852, 2 vols.) for the same society by Richard Parkinson, with a family memoir (written 1846) by Thomas Newcome. It has none of the graphic power of the contemporary Life of Adam Martindale, and is very introspective, but gives a clear picture of the writer in his much-tried sensitiveness and his unascetic puritanism. Newcome was no stranger to the shuttle-board or the billiard table; though he never drank healths he drank wine, and had a weakness for tobacco. As a contributor to the local history of his time he is in one respect more useful than Martindale; he very rarely conceals names."]}, {"page": "James Heywood (philanthropist)", "response": ["James Heywood was born on 28 May 1810 in Manchester, Lancashire.

In June that year he was \"botanising\" on Kersal Moor when he met John Horsefield, a handloom weaver from Whitefield, who was president of the Prestwich Botanical Society and president of the general botanical meetings held at a number of different places in Lancashire. Buxton had long wished to meet a man such as Horsefield, who was not merely a country herbalist but an excellent scientific botanist. At that time in Lancashire many amateur, working class, naturalists pursued their interests in their spare time, and a number of local societies had been formed. Horsefield introduced him to other local botanists such as James Percival, Thomas Heywood and John Shaw with whom, during the summer of 1826, he made a number of excursions to Mere Clough in Prestwich, Clifton Moss and Baguley Moor."]}, {"page": "Thomas Heywood (disambiguation)", "response": ["Thomas Heywood was a playwright and actor.", "Thomas Heywood may also refer to:", "*Thomas Heywood (railway engineer) (1877\u20131953), British locomotive engineer", "*Thomas Heywood (antiquarian) (1797\u20131866), English member of the Chetham Society ", "*Thomas Heywood (organist) (born 1974), Australian concert organist"]}, {"page": "John Horsefield", "response": ["Horsefield and his father were members of an early 19th-century loose grouping of Mancunian amateur botanists, and of a short-livedCash (2011), p. 73. botanical society for working men in Whitefield.
