It was attended by many people, and attracted much newspaper publicity. It followed the death of Kate Dover's 61-year-old employer and lover, Thomas Skinner from arsenic poisoning. Known as the Queen of Heeley for her fashionable taste in clothes, Dover was 27 years old at the time, and was Skinner's housekeeper. She was convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to penal servitude for life, which she served at Woking Female Prison. By 1901, she was out of jail. She lived her remaining years with her sisters in Rotherham.", "Kate Dover (Sheffield, 1855 \u2013 Rotherham, 26 March 1925) was the daughter of a woodcarver. She lived with her family at 4 Thirwell Terrace, Heeley, Sheffield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. According to The Scotsman and The Sheffield Independent, Dover was known as the Queen of Heeley due to her use of make-up and fashionable clothes. She became a housekeeper to Thomas Skinner of 24 Glover Place, Sheffield, who was also her \"sweetheart\".", "==Thomas Skinner, victim==", "Thomas Skinner (Sheffield, 16 June 1819 \u2013 Sheffield, 6 December 1881) was an etcher, inventor and amateur oil-painter. When he met the 26-year-old Kate Dover in 1880, he was a widower aged 60 years, a drunkard, and was fairly well-to-do as a result of the income from his invention which related to etching on steel blades.", "On 2 December 1881, Jane Jones received a gift of produce including onions and potatoes, \"from her husband's brother in Bedfordshire\". On the same day she and her husband ate some of the produce, and forwarded the remainder, including \"fifteen potatoes, four large onions and some apples\" to Thomas Skinner. Ada Wheatley delivered the vegetables. On receipt, Skinner said, \"These are extra to what we get here\", but Dover said \"Humph\", and \"pitched the onions down the cellar steps\". On the same day, Dover asked the chemist J.J. Redding for prussic acid on sugar to kill a cat, but he refused because cats do not eat sugar.", "File:The Big Tree - Chesterfield Road 02-06-05.jpg|alt=Two-storey brick building|The Big Tree pub where Kate Dover and Thomas Skinner had a friendly drink, the night before his death", "Thomas Skinner was killed on 6 December 1881. On that morning, Dover told Taylor that Skinner \"was very ill, and always dozing and sleepy, and said she believed he would die\", when in truth he \"appeared to have been in his usual state of health\". Dover \"was the one that made the dinner and attended to it in all respects\". Although Dover had prepared a roast chicken, she made goose stuffing with herbs, bread and onions, not chicken stuffing of forcemeat or sausage meat as was usual in the Victorian era. Moreover, she split the stuffing into two portions, cooking one portion inside the chicken, and one in a separate tin. Dinner consisting of stuffed chicken and Yorkshire pudding was served around midday, but the servant Emma Bolsover ate a lamb chop separately in the kitchen and did not join Dover and Skinner for the meal. Skinner called out for his meal, saying that \"he did not know when he felt so hungry as he did then\", however he had to wait another half-hour for his meal. Skinner's plate was piled with stuffing but Dover's was much less so. Five minutes after beginning the meal, Dover declared herself ill. Skinner immediately said, \"I feel bad too...My God, she has done for us both this time,\" referring to Jane Jones who had sent the onions. He then \"vomited, very considerably\", and \"seemed to be suffering very much\". Dover \"seemed to have got frightened, (possibly) at the results of administering the poison, and was trying to remedy what she had done\".", "The inquest into the death of Skinner was opened at the Royal Hotel (later called the Victoria Inn) at the convergence of London Road and Abbeydale Road, Sheffield, on 9 December 1881, and reopened at 1.00\u00a0pm on 18 December 1881. Kate's mother Catharine gave evidence \"full of contradictions to other witnesses\" in place of her daughter who was ill. She spoke of the affection between Kate Dover and Skinner, Kate's need to use make-up to hide her pallid complexion, and the innocent purposes for which Kate obtained various poisons. The coroner published more than thirty love notes between Dover and an old man of 85 years. These had been found hidden in a picture frame at Skinner's house. The letters make clear that Skinner knew about and did not object to meetings between Dover and the old man \"Emerson\" or \"E.M.\", who regularly gave her money for clothes. The jury decided twelve to three that Dover had administered the poison to Skinner. The coroner recorded that Dover \"wilfully and of malice aforethought did kill and murder the said Thomas Skinner\".", "File:Gravestone of Thomas Skinner etcher (7).JPG|alt=gravestone|The victim's grave at All Saints Church, Ecclesall "]}, {"page": "Kate Dover", "response": ["Felicia Dorothea Kate Dover (1855 \u2013 26 March 1925) was an English woman who was tried for murder and convicted of manslaughter in 1882 following the death of Thomas Skinner from arsenic poisoning.
