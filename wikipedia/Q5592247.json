He was Chairman of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) from 2002\u20132003. One of Graeme's trademarks is his Scooby-Doo wardrobe. He has said of his work that \"I've not stuck to any one genre, platform or IP throughout my career, and I hope people eventually work out that's just fine.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ataxx", "response": ["In 1993, Virgin released the Trilobyte-produced game The 7th Guest, which contained a version of Ataxx as its Microscope Puzzle. Graeme Devine of Trilobyte, co-creator of The 7th Guest, had overseen the production of Spot while working at Virgin. The Microscope Puzzle is one of the most popular versions of Ataxx. The player faces off with the AI in the game, in this case the antagonist \"Stauf\", who is incredibly difficult to beat\u2014all the while laughing and ridiculing the player with phrases like \"Ooooooooo Baaaaaaaad Mooooooooove,\" and \"We'll all be dead by the time you solve this!\" If the player makes a particularly successful move, Stauf yells \"Curses!\" The pieces were seen through a microscope on a slide, interpreted as bacterial cells, two sets blue and two sets green. Passing over this puzzle in the game requires two trips to the library to the hint book. In April 2011, an updated version of the Microscope Puzzle was released as a stand-alone app for iPad under the title The 7th Guest: Infection."]}, {"page": "Full-motion video", "response": ["With the re-popularization of FMV games in the early 1990s following the advent of CD-ROM, higher-end developers usually created their own custom FMV formats to suit their needs.  Early FMV titles used game-specific proprietary video renderers optimized for the content of the video (e.g., live-action vs. animated), because CPUs of the day were incapable of playing back real-time MPEG-1 until the fastest 486 and Pentium CPUs arrived. Consoles, on the other hand, either used a third-party codec (e.g., Cinepak for Sega CD games) or used their own proprietary format (e.g. the Philips CD-i). Video quality steadily increased as CPUs became more powerful to support higher quality video compression and decompression. The 7th Guest, one of the first megahit multiple-CD-ROM games, was one of the first games to feature transparent quality 640x320 FMV at 15 frames per second in a custom format designed by programmer Graeme Devine."]}, {"page": "The 7th Guest", "response": ["The 7th Guest was the brainchild of game designer/graphic artist Rob Landeros, and a Virgin MasterTronics programmer, Graeme Devine. When Landeros and Devine presented their idea for the game to Martin Alper, CEO of Virgin Games, they were promptly \"fired\" so that with Virgin's help they could start their own company, Trilobyte, dedicated solely to the development of this game. They originally intended to create the movements through the mansion using video. 3D graphics and animation were introduced to the title early in 1991 when Robert Stein III joined the team."]}, {"page": "Trilobyte (company)", "response": ["Trilobyte is a computer game developer founded in December 1990 by Graeme Devine and Rob Landeros.

Internally RoQ uses vector quantization to encode video and DPCM to encode audio. While the format itself is proprietary it was successfully reverse-engineered in 2001, and the actual RoQ decoder is present in the Quake 3 source code release. RoQ has seen little use outside games based on the id Tech 3 or id Tech 4 engines, but is supported by several video players (such as MPlayer) and a handful of third-party encoders exist. One notable exception is the Unreal Engine-based game Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend, which uses RoQ files for its intro and outro cutscenes, as well as for a joke cutscene that plays after a mission at the end of part one."]}]}}
