The company was founded as DMA Design in Dundee in 1987 by David Jones, soon hiring former classmates Mike Dailly, Russell Kay, and Steve Hammond. During its early years, DMA Design was backed by its publisher Psygnosis, primarily focusing on Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64 games. During this time, they created successful shooters such as Menace, and Blood Money, but soon turned to platform games after the release of Lemmings in 1991, which was an international success and led to several sequels and spin-offs. After developing Unirally for Nintendo, DMA Design was set to become one of their main second-party developers, but this partnership ended after Nintendo's disapproval of Body Harvest.", "In 1984, David Jones, Russell Kay, Steve Hammond and Mike Dailly often met at the Kingsway Amateur Computer Club (KACC) in Dundee. While Jones used an Amiga 1000, the others used Sinclair Spectrum or Commodore 64. They developed numerous small games while attending the KACC: Jones and Kay developed Moonshadow (eventually renamed Zone Trooper), Daily developed Freek Out, and Jones and Dailly collaborated on The Game With No Name. When later attending the Dundee Institute of Technology, Jones began development on a game tentatively titled CopperCon1, working under the temporary name \"Acme Software\", alongside Kay, Hammond and Dailly. To publish the game, Jones first approached Hewson Consultants, where Andrew Braybrook played and recommended the game. When Jones was informed that Hewson wanted the game to be the \"Amiga version of Zynaps\", he realised that sales would be limited, and refused to sign the contract, instead signing a deal with publisher Psygnosis. The game was renamed Draconia, with Tony Smith working on graphics and Jones designing levels."]}, {"page": "Uniracers", "response": ["Shortly after the game's release, DMA Design was sued by Pixar for allegedly copying the unicycle design and concept from their 1987 short film Red's Dream. Mike Dailly, one of the developers at DMA Design, commented, \"The problem with Pixar was that they seemed to think that any computer generated unicycle was owned by them.\" DMA Design lost the lawsuit, and as a result, Nintendo had to terminate production of further Unirally cartridges. According to Dailly, \"The deal was that Nintendo wouldn't make any more carts so Unirally only sold the 300k initial run\". Fellow DMA Design developer Robbie Graham recalled, \"They took footage from Red's Dream and compared it to Unirally and the unicycles were virtually the same; this isn't a big surprise as there\u2019s not a lot of ways you can bring life to a unicycle without looking like the one Pixar did.

The larger character size really spoiled it, but it was done like that because we had been approached by The Children's Television Workshop who wanted to use the character and the game; they wanted the characters to be bigger, and that really complicated things, and spoiled it. By the end of Lemmings 3, I think we were all ready to move on.\" DMA Design head David Jones similarly remarked, \"We needed a break for a while after Lemmings. Three years of hell.\" A 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was announced to be in development and slated to be published by Psygnosis during E3 1995, however this port was never released for unknown reasons."]}, {"page": "Blood Money (video game)", "response": ["With Blood Money, Jones was determined to use the full colour range of the Amiga, opting to use the blitter as opposed to the hardware scrolling; the blitter allowed graphics to be drawn quickly. Tony Smith, who had worked on Menace, produced the graphics for Blood Money, while Jones began work on a new scrolling system. While developing his own game, Talisman, Mike Dailly created a compact method to move enemies on-screen, which Jones incorporated into Blood Money. The game's animations fascinated Jones' friend Gary Timmons, who then began experimenting with Deluxe Paint; his work on the program led to his employment at DMA Design, and inspired some of the animations used in DMA's next game, Walker (1993). The game's introduction required a star field, which Jones took from a quick demonstration that Dailly had been working on."]}, {"page": "List of best-selling video game franchises", "response": ["| colspan=\"3\" |Grand Theft Auto is an open-world action-adventure video game series created by David Jones and Mike Dailly; the later titles of which were created by brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut.
