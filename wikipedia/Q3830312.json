In August 1897, he sent the publisher Leonard Smithers an initial draft of the Ballad, which made such an impression that Smithers was enthusiastic about publishing it and even approached Aubrey Beardsley to do an illustration for it (which was not done). Thereafter there was a very active correspondence between the two of them, as Wilde was repeatedly revising and expanding the text, and supervising from afar the choice and size of typeface and the layout of the work. However, even the printing house hired to do the book demanded a change\u2014for fear that the prison doctor would sue over the line which originally read \"While the coarse-mouthed doctor gloats\", it was changed to \"While some coarse-mouthed doctor gloats\". As one biographer, Leonard Cresswell Ingleby, said, \"Never, perhaps, since Gray's Elegy had a poem been so revised, pruned, and polished over and over again as this cry from a prison cell\". Originally the first edition\u2014with no assurance of a second edition\u2014was planned for only 400 copies, but when Wilde calculated the printing expenses, he realised that even selling all 400 would not cover costs, and at his instigation Smithers instructed the printing house to double the number of copies and keep the printing plates in hopes of a reprinting. As publication day approached, Wilde was occasionally seized by a sort of panic over his finances and the risks of the poem failing to sell well, and made some half-hearted efforts to sell the poem's copyright for immediate cash; there were only a few disappointing nibbles and no such sale was made. Fortunately, the poem sold very well and very quickly, and caused such a stir that subsequent printings also sold well for more than a year, assuring Wilde of a steady income which he did not outlive, as he died less than four years after the Ballad first appeared.Nelson, James G., Publisher to the Decadents: Leonard Smithers in the careers of Beardsley, Wilde, Dowson (2000, Pennsylvania State Univ.) chapt. 6, pages 173\u2013224; Harris, Frank, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916, NY) vol. 2, pages 387\u2013400; Ingleby, Leonard Cresswell, Oscar Wilde (1907, London) pages 283\u2013298 (the line quoted is on page 286); Mason, Stuart, Bibliography of the Poems of Oscar Wilde (1907, London) pages 76\u201384; Mason, Stuart, Bibliography of Oscar Wilde (1914, London) pages 407\u2013423."]}, {"page": "Priapeia", "response": ["In 1890, the Priapeia were translated into English by Leonard Smithers and Sir Richard BurtonThe Priapeia Index - Sacred Texts (the latter of whom also freely translated The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night), who provided numerous glosses concerning the sexual practices and proclivities that are referenced in the poems.

In 1899, Gyles illustrated Wilde's The Harlot's House, which was published by Leonard Smithers. Gyles became involved with Smithers, which eventually caused Yeats to distance himself from her. Later in 1899, she designed the covers for Ernest Dowson's Decorations, which featured a stylised rose that Yeats described as her \"central symbol.\" For the top board of The Night (1900), by John White-Rodyng, she pictured four swirling birds pecking at a heart between a sun and a moon, with stars. By mid-September 1900, Arthur Symons discovered her in an empty room at 15, Granby Place, Hampstead Road, \"without a thing in the place, except five books (one a presentation copy from Oscar Wilde) and one or two fantastic gold ornaments which she used to wear; chloral by her side, and the bed strewn with MSS.\" Gyles had left her library with Yeats, to save it from the bailiffs. Symons sold Gyles's poem For a Sepulchre to the Saturday Review. She was recovering in the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, in the City Road, when Smithers went bankrupt.
