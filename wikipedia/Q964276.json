He was the leader of the Monaghan Brigade of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and a prominent figure in the Ulster IRA during the Irish War of Independence. In this capacity he became Chief of Staff of the IRA in 1922. He accepted the Anglo-Irish Treaty and served as a general in the National Army in the Irish Civil War, on the pro-Treaty side.\nO'Duffy became the second Commissioner of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the police force of the new Irish Free State, after the Civic Guard Mutiny and the subsequent resignation of Michael Staines. He had been an early member of Sinn F\u00e9in. He was elected as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for Monaghan, his home county, during the 1921 election. After a split in Sinn F\u00e9in in 1923, he became associated with Cumann na nGaedheal and led the movement known as the Blueshirts. After the merger of various pro-Treaty factions under the banner of Fine Gael, O'Duffy was the party leader for a short time, before leaving the party in 1934.\nO'Duffy was attracted to the various fascist movements on the continent. He raised the Irish Brigade to fight for Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War as an act of Catholic solidarity and was inspired by Benito Mussolini's Italy to found the National Corporate Party. During the Second World War, he offered to Nazi Germany the prospect of raising an Irish Brigade to fight against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, but this was not taken up.\nO'Duffy was active in multiple sporting bodies, including the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Irish Olympic Council.", "link_mentions": {}}}
