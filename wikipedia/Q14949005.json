After studying zoology at the University of Edinburgh he began his career in marine science before joining The Times newspaper as the world's only Ocean Correspondent (between 2008 and 2011) to cover the fast-changing science, environment and geopolitics of the sea and help increase visibility of the crisis facing marine ecosystems. During this time he published two books, Dragon Sea (Penguin, 2007) and 72 Hours (Orion, 2011) and hosted the BBC Series Britain's Secret Seas. \nAfter joining Save the Elephants in 2012 Pope helped establish the Elephant Crisis Fund (a joint initiative between Save the Elephants & the Wildlife Conservation Network), supporting more than 58 different partner organisations across Africa and the world in conducting over 180 projects in the realms of anti-poaching, anti-trafficking and demand reduction. An experienced bush pilot, Pope is married to Saba Douglas-Hamilton, daughter of STE founder Iain Douglas-Hamilton. They live in Kenya with their three children. In 2015, they made the BBC Natural History Unit series This Wild Life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saba Douglas-Hamilton", "response": ["In February 2006, Saba married conservationist and journalist Frank Pope in a traditional Kenyan ceremony.

The site where the remains lie was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 on 24 October 2008.  The wreck is considered important partly for its historical references and partly for its insight into an important period in British naval history.  Although the Port of London Authority had voluntarily taken action to reduce the risk of damage to shipping, the removal of bronze cannon from the site without any archaeological investigations being carried out showed that the site was at risk of destruction through looting and hence required immediate protection."]}]}}
