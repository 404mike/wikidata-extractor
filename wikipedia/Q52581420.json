DNA had been identified as the carrier of genetic information by the Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment in 1944, but the mechanism of how genetic information was stored in DNA was unclear.X-ray diffraction patterns of DNA by Florence Bell in her Ph.D. thesis (1939) were similar to (although not as good as) \"photo 51\", but this research was interrupted by the events of World War II."]}, {"page": "Raymond Gosling", "response": ["When he arrived at King's College London, Gosling was directed by Sir John Randall to work on the problem of the structure of DNA.  Randall was convinced that DNA was the material which transmitted the genetic code. Randall assigned him to work on X-ray diffraction with Maurice Wilkins, analysing samples of DNA which they prepared by hydrating and drawing out into thin filaments and photographing in a hydrogen atmosphere.  He made the first x-ray diffraction image of crystallized DNA.  His comment on this discovery was \"I must be the first person ever to make genes crystallize\", although he was probably unaware of the prior work of Florence Bell."]}, {"page": "William Astbury", "response": ["But proteins were not the only biological fibre that Astbury studied. In 1937 Torbj\u00f6rn Caspersson of Sweden sent him well prepared samples of DNA from calf thymus. The fact that DNA produced a diffraction pattern indicated that it also had a regular structure and it might be feasible to deduce it. Astbury was able to obtain some external funding and he employed the crystallographer Florence Bell. She recognised that the \"beginnings of life [were] clearly associated with the interaction of proteins and nucleic acids\". Bell and Astbury published an X-ray study on DNA in 1938, describing the nucleotides as a \"Pile of Pennies\".", "Franklin and Gosling's 'Photo 51' provided one of several important clues to Watson and Crick -but Astbury's response to Beighton's very similar X-ray images of DNA could not have been more different. He never published them in a journal or presented them at a scientific meeting. Given that Astbury was such a renowned expert in X-ray studies of biological molecules this apparent neglect of such an important clue may seem surprising. One explanation is that, although Astbury recognised the importance of DNA, he did not understand that biological information was carried in the one-dimensional sequence of bases within the molecule but rather, that it resided in subtle and elaborate variations in its three-dimensional structure. Far from making his jaw drop and his pulse race, the revelation that DNA was a simple a twisting helix would therefore have been a disappointment but it is intriguing to speculate on how differently history might have unfolded had Astbury shown Beighton's image to his friend and colleague the eminent US chemist and Nobel Laureate, Linus Pauling when he visited Astbury at his home in Headingley, Leeds in 1952. Pauling was, at that time, Watson and Crick's greatest rival in trying to solve the structure of DNA and was desperate to obtain a good quality X-ray diffraction image of DNA. In 1952, he had already proposed an incorrect model of DNA based on Astbury and Bell's early work but had Astbury shown Pauling these new images taken by Beighton, it might well have been Caltech, Pasadena and not Cambridge, UK that is today remembered for the discovery of the double-helix. Despite this missed opportunity, Astbury, together with Florence Bell, had made a major contribution by showing that the methods of X-ray crystallography could be used to reveal the regular, ordered structure of DNA.", "*'Florence Bell \u2013 the other Dark Lady of DNA'"]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2000", "response": ["*Florence Bell, 87, British scientist."]}, {"page": "Florence Bell", "response": ["Florence Bell may refer to:", "*Florence Bell (writer) (1851\u20131930), British writer and playwright", "*Florence Bell (scientist) (1913\u20132000), British DNA researcher", "*Florence Bell (skier) (born 1996), British alpine skier"]}, {"page": "Florence Ogilvy Bell", "response": ["#redirect Florence Bell (scientist)"]}, {"page": "Bell, Florence Ogilvy", "response": ["#redirect Florence Bell (scientist)"]}, {"page": "Florence Ogilvy Sawyer", "response": ["#redirect Florence Bell (scientist)"]}]}}
