This product is sometimes called the Frobenius product. In general, the product of two subgroups S and T is a subgroup if and only if ST = TS, and the two subgroups are said to permute. (Walter Ledermann has called this fact the Product Theorem,Walter Ledermann, Introduction to Group Theory, 1976, Longman, , p. 52 but this name, just like \"Frobenius product\" is by no means standard.)
