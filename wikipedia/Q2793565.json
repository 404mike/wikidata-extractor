Kyle Campbell of IGN said Ardbert \"stole the show\" while debriefing the hero after each mission. Natalie Flores of VG247 felt that Emet-Selch was a true foil to the main character and that the writing for his character was a high water mark for the series. She commended scenario writer Natsuko Ishikawa for balancing him as a sympathetic villain without justifying his reprehensible supremacist beliefs. Messner called Emet-Selch the \"best Final Fantasy nemesis since Kefka\". Alexandra appreciated the \"adversarial\" but \"genuinely playful\" dynamic that he brought to the group. She attributed part of his appeal to his voice actor, Ren\u00e9 Zagger. However, she criticized the use of fatphobic tropes in the depiction of Vauthry. Natalie Flores from Vice called Elidibus a \"chilling adversary\" and \"populism incarnate\", while Chingy Nea from Kotaku lauded him as one of the most brilliant and memorable villains in the entire Final Fantasy series, \"a fascinating character with a compelling and metatextual emotional arc\". The voice cast overall was well received. Many reviewers also enjoyed the immersive quality of Trust companions' dialogue and preferred to explore dungeons for the first time using Trusts as a result."]}]}}
