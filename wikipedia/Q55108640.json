It was the first perfect game for the Giants franchise (first in San Francisco), the ninth in NL history, the fifth no-hitter thrown by MLB pitchers in 2012, and the second perfect game of the season after Chicago White Sox pitcher Philip Humber threw one on April 21. Cain threw 125 pitches, the most by a pitcher in a perfect game, and received the most run support ever for a pitcher throwing a perfect game. Cain also singled against Rhiner Cruz and scored in the fifth inning. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, in recognition of the perfect game, presented Cain with the key to the city and made a proclamation that June 13 every year will be known as \"Matt Cain Day\". In addition, Cain set a franchise record for a single-game score at 101 and is currently the first and only Giants pitcher to break the 100 barrier."]}, {"page": "Madonna: Truth or Dare", "response": ["Joe Coscarelli from The New York Times felt that \"[Truth or Dare] has transcended cult-classic status and been elevated to the modern canon by pop obsessives and queer audiences of a certain generation. It also in many ways presaged the celeb-reality complex\".  Nina Metz from the Chicago Tribune, noted an impact on reality television, as it was released just  a year before MTV's The Real World premiered. Lee Barron wrote on his book Celebrity Cultures: An Introduction, that the film was a precursor to the confessional technique many reality shows would go on to adopt. A similar opinion was shared by The Daily Telegraphs Matt Cain, who also added that it predated \"the modern wave of manipulated and 'structured' reality TV\". According to Benjamin Halligan, Robert Edgar and Kirsty Fairclough-Isaacs, authors of The Music Documentary: Acid Rock to Electropop, \"echoes of this particular documentary can be seen throughout contemporary celebrity culture, particularly in reality TV. It answered, or reflected or engendered, an intense public fascination with all facets of celebrity life\". These thoughts were shared by Jason Baily from Flavorwire, who concluded that it's impossible to imagine something like Keeping Up with the Kardashians without the \"precedent\" of Truth or Dare.

In the Summer of 2019, the Bolton Museum hosted the British Museum touring exhibition \"Desire Love Identity\" exhibition in its renovated temporary exhibition space.  The exhibition told the story of LGBT+ history in the UK with this iteration featuring several Bolton specific objects and documents to tell the story of local LGBT+ history in the context of the major national history. The exhibition also featured \"Museum Monologues\", five in-gallery dramatisations produced by Inkbrew Productions. Talks given included Matt Cain (writer) in conversation with James Edgington, discussing his book 'The Madonna of Bolton'. Displays included recalling the progress and creation of 'Bolton Pride' and looked back at the local history of activism, campaigns, events and figures from Bolton's LGBT+ past including displays of photographs and documents of Bolton's first LGB youth group, YGLIB volunteers meeting Anne, Princess Royal. There were also exhibits illustrating the roles of James William Wallace (of the Eagle Street College), Vesta Tilley and Humphrey Spender."]}, {"page": "Cultural impact of Madonna", "response": ["Called a \"major 'historical figure'\" by academic Camille Paglia, Madonna attained the status of a \"cultural icon\" as was noted by cultural theorists like Stuart Sim. Professors in Ageing, Popular Culture and Contemporary Feminism (2014) commented that \"her status as a cultural icon is acknowledged in all press accounts\". Frenchman scholar Georges Claude Guilbert proposed her as a postmodern myth while an author from El Cultural wrote in 2015 that she \"surpasses the laws of physics, time, popular culture, and even metaphysics\". A subject of diverse listicles during her career, scholars such as Frances Negr\u00f3n-Muntaner, Robert M. Grant or George Claude Guilbert have seen and commented how Madonna was labeled during her career as the \"most famous female (artist)/woman\" on the planet, while writer Matt Cain expressed she is \"one of the most famous women ever to have lived\". Both Madonna's references and impact are found \u2014but not limited to\u2014 in the arts, literature, cinema, the music and even science.", "Madonna has been also noted for her constantly image and style changes (often called reivention), with Ludovic Hunter-Tilney Financial Times commenting that \"her image changes have launched countless fads and fuelled a boom in jargon-filled academic studies about her as a post-feminist chameleon\". Writer Matt Cain said that \"she popularized reinvention\". Australian scholar McKenzie Wark assured that alongside David Bowie both \"raised this to a fine art\".  Authors of Queer Style (2013), the New Zealand fashion academic Vicki Karaminas and Australian lecturer Adam Geczy explained: She \"transmogrified from virgin to dominatrix to \u00dcber Fran, each time achieving iconic status\", asserting that Madonna is \"the first woman to do so-and with mainstream panache and approbation\". The importance of those changes was expressed by Roger Ebert who felt: \"Pop sociologists have made a specialty out of Madonnaology, claiming she changes images so quickly that she is always ahead of her audience\". American journalist Chris Smith added another significance and wrote in 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music (2007) that she \"manipulated her image beyond the limits of music's traditional media, and in doing so extended her reach as a musical artist to that of near-legendary cultural phenomenon\". John Intini from Canadian magazine Maclean's said: \"The art of reinvention\u2014of which Madonna is queen\u2014has saved many musical careers\". ", "* Scholar Frances Negr\u00f3n-Muntaner commented: \"[Madonna] has been labeled \"the most famous woman alive who has imprinted, one way or another, not only a generation but the world\". French academic Georges Claude Guilbert documented that \"in the American, British, Australian and French press\" (his four principal sources) \"it is generally taken for granted that Madonna is the most famous female in the world\". In similar approaches, British scholar and economist Robert M. Grant described her as \"the best known woman on the planet\" in a class about her in 2008. More context and similar perceptions were provided by multiple authors, with political advisor Aaron Klein commenting in 2007 that she is probably \"the most well-known American celebrity in the Middle East\". When she was living in the United Kingdom Rosie Millard from BBC described her as \"arguably the most famous persona currently residing in the UK\". British author Matt Cain summarized in 2018: \"she's one of the most famous women ever to have lived\". According to Orlando Sentinel, Cornell University ranked Madonna in 2014 as the \"most influential woman in history\" based in a study of Wikipedia algorithms. Furthermore, financial adviser Alvin Hall placed Madonna in 2003 as the \"world's most powerful celebrity\" at that time."]}, {"page": "The Madonna of Bolton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Matt Cain (writer)"]}, {"page": "The Secret Life of Albert Entwistle", "response": ["#REDIRECT Matt Cain (writer)"]}]}}
