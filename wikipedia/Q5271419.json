Connell and Jackson, outside of their usual roles as Manchester musicians in A Certain Ratio and Magazine, were producing Electro tracks for Morgan Khan's Streetwise label with a degree of underground success. This activity triggered interest from a few major labels including Phonogram/Mercury Records. Vocalised songs were asked for, so Connell, who knew Charlemagne through Factory Records, approached her to sing on the Phonogram demos. These demos helped secure Connell and Jackson's major label contract. This was the period in which 52nd Street moved from Factory Records to Virgin Records and as a result, Diane Charlemagne's Swing Out Sister involvement ended."]}, {"page": "52nd Street (band)", "response": ["McDonald was replaced by Diane Charlemagne (later lead vocalist with Moby and would go on to bigger UK success with the Urban Cookie Collective)."]}, {"page": "Liquid funk", "response": ["On 1 October 2007, High Contrast brought liquid funk back to the mainstream with his album, Tough Guys Don't Dance, releasing tracks such as \"If We Ever\" (featuring Diane Charlemagne) which made Radio 1's Dance singles chart, \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", and \"Tread Softly\".

It has been described as a ghetto-blues ballad, 'a yearning reverie of sanctuary from \"inner-city pressure\"' and features a sample from Ike Turner's song \"Funky Mule\", from his 1969 album, A Black Man's Soul. Goldie/Metal Heads became the first jungle act to make the Radio One playlist, albeit the N-list, with the track.", "Andy Kellman from AllMusic described the song as \"emotive\".

Diane Charlemagne's superb vocal soars over the plunging bass, galloping beats and almost ambient synth sweeps. It is a powerful combination that is earning DJ plays from unlikely quarters and deserves to cross over.\" Brad Beatnik from the magazine's RM Dance Update said, \"Perhaps the most talked about record of this month, 'Inner City Life' is actually only a small part of an impressively large picture. (...) The use of the strings and strong female vocals are the defining characteristics on a tune that deserves a standing ovation.\" Another editor, James Hamilton noted that \"Diane Charlemagne calmly wails in jazz samba style through swirling shrill strings and explosively skittering 0-155-0bpm jungle beats, weird and atmospheric\". Rupert Howe from Muzik wrote, \"This is a masterpiece of melancholy, with all the dark/light, bass/melody contrasts in jungle thrown into kaleidoscopic relief. The spectral strings move disturbingly in and out of focus, the low frequencies seem to open up underneath you, and the eerie mutations of Diane Charlemagne's vocals float in the ether, utterly lost in space. Emotionally, it's all over the place - joyful one minute, intense enough to suck the daylight out of you the next.

Charles Aaron from Spin commented, \"...Goldie has been doing time for a couple of years in London's hardcore techno and jungle scene where insanely speedy breakbeats mixed with goofy vocal snatches run on endless loop. But with \"Inner City Life\", he inhabits another realm altogether. Like Marvin Gaye ruminating while rushing, he fades a breathtaking vocal by Diane Charlemagne (plus muted trumpet) in and out of ethereal beats. Fraught with dub's tensely apocalyptic vision and techno's hopeful twitch, this is finally the sound of an urban pulse that acknowledges both black and white expressions and tensions, and the feeling of coming up, going down, and needing to keep dancing forever. No other jungle I've heard has sounded like this. Or any other dance music, for that matter.\" Shane Danielsen from The Sydney Morning Herald noted the \"swirling strings\" of the track, \"underpinned by complex poly-rhythms and booming subsonics.\"Danielsen, Shane (December 11, 1995). \"CD Guide > Electronic > Goldie: Timeless\". p. 13.
