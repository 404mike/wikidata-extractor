He is now also a commentator/pundit and TV personality. He is also referred to by the nickname \"Billy Whizz\". In April 2017, he was critically injured after being involved in a collision at Donington Park that caused both of his legs to be amputated, one below the knee and the other above the knee. Until that, he had been heavily involved in kart racing all over the UK and the Channel Islands and then a successful Ginetta Junior racer.\nAfter treatment and therapy, Monger returned to competition in November 2017. In 2018, Monger was awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity.From 2019, he supplied analysis for Channel 4's F1 coverage. He also competed in the Formula 3 based Euroformula Open championship for Carlin Motorsport, achieving his first single seater race win at the 2019 Pau Grand Prix.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlwood", "response": ["* Billy Monger, British Formula 3 racing driver, survived a huge accident at Donnington Park in 2017, lost both of his lower legs."]}, {"page": "Segrave Trophy", "response": ["The inaugural recipient of the Segrave Trophy was Australian-born Charles Kingsford Smith who flew solo from Ireland to Newfoundland, across the Atlantic, in just over 31 hours.

British aviatrix Amy Johnson became the first female recipient of the trophy in 1932 when she was cited for her flight from London to Cape Town in a de Havilland Puss Moth.
