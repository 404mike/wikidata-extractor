He made his competitive debut for his new club on 15 September in the 3\u20131 away win at Droylsden, replacing Conal Platt as a substitute in the 65th minute.

His first goal for the club was scored on 26 January 2008, away at Rushden & Diamonds, as Weymouth were defeated 3\u20132. Paolo Vernazza took a free kick in the 25th minute after Stuart Beavon was fouled just outside the penalty area by Curtis Osano. Doe scored with a header, which took a slight deflection as the ball crossed the goal line. During Weymouth's 2\u20131 away defeat on 1 March to Halifax Town, Doe was controversially sent off three minutes into stoppage time. He was sent off for a tackle on Andy Campbell, but manager John Hollins claimed \"there is no doubt that Scott got the ball\". Weymouth finished the season in 18th position, defying relegation, with Doe ending the 2007\u201308 season having made 33 appearances in the Conference, scoring once. Doe won the \"Supporters Player of The Year\" award, describing it as \"the best thing in the World\". He admitted he did not expect to play more than 15 games during the season, saying \"when I first came to the club I thought I might play 15 games throughout the whole season but I have ended up playing over twice that and it has just been fantastic\" stated Doe."]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Paolo Vernazza "]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["! scope=\"row\"|Paolo Vernazza", "!scope=\"row\"|Paolo Vernazza "]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Paolo Vernazza "]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Paolo Vernazza "]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Watford F.C. season", "response": ["*  Paolo Vernazza \u2013  Rotherham United, free"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Paolo Vernazza"]}]}}
