Rogers hosted social breakfasts with guests such as Thomas Macaulay, Henry Hallam, Sydney Smith, George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope, Nassau Senior, Charles Greville, Henry Hart Milman, Anthony Panizzi, George Cornewall Lewis, and Sylvain Van de Weyer. An invitation to one of Rogers's breakfasts was a formal entry into literary society, and his dinners were even more select. His social success was due less to his literary position than to his powers as a conversationalist, his educated taste in all matters of art, and no doubt to his sarcastic and bitter wit, for which he excused himself by saying that he had such a small voice that no one listened if he said pleasant things. \"He certainly had the kindest heart and unkindest tongue of any one I ever knew,\" said Fanny Kemble. He helped the poet Robert Bloomfield, he reconciled Thomas Moore with Francis Jeffrey and with Byron, and he relieved Sheridan's difficulties in the last days of his life. Moore, who refused help from all his friends, and would only owe debts to his publishers, found it possible to accept help from Rogers. He procured a pension for HF Cary, the translator of Dante, and obtained Wordsworth his sinecure as distributor of stamps. John Mitford, while maintaining his country livings, rented permanent lodgings in Sloane Street, where he enjoyed \"the most perfect intimacy with Samuel Rogers for more than twenty years\"."]}, {"page": "George Howard", "response": ["* George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle (1802\u20131864), British politician and statesman"]}, {"page": "George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle", "response": ["# George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle (1802\u20131864), who did not marry."]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle"]}, {"page": "George William Frederick Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle", "response": ["#redirect George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle"]}, {"page": "Brampton, Carlisle", "response": ["The town is overlooked by the large medieval motte known as The Mote, which is surmounted by a statue of George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire", "response": ["*George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle 18 June 1847 \u2013 5 December 1864"]}, {"page": "George Frederick William Howard Carlisle", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle"]}]}}
