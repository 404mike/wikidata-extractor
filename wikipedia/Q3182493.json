What seems to have lifted use of Cumbrian dialect from a passing curiosity to a demonstration of regional pride in the hands of labouring class poets was the vogue of Robert Burns, among whose disciples the calico worker Robert Anderson counted himself. His Ballads in the Cumberland Dialect were published from Carlisle in 1805 and were reprinted in several different formats over the following decades. Some of these publications also incorporated the work of his precursors and a few other contemporaries, such as Ewan Clark and Mark Lonsdale. One such collection was Ballads in the Cumberland dialect, chiefly by R. Anderson (1808, second edition 1815, Wigton),Google Books and a third from Carlisle in 1823."]}, {"page": "Stagg", "response": ["*John Stagg (poet) (1770\u20131823), English poet", "*SS John Stagg, a tanker ship (1943\u20131968)"]}, {"page": "John Stagg", "response": ["John Stagg may refer to:", "* SS John Stagg, a tanker-type Liberty ship, named after John Stagg (1864\u20131915), president of Alabama Presbyterian College for Men", "* John Stagg (poet) (1770\u20131823), English poet "]}, {"page": "Robert Anderson (poet)", "response": ["Although Anderson was largely responsible for the contemporary popularisation of English dialect poetry, his 1805 Ballads were far from the first.
