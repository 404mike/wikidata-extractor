He scored 101 goals in 464 league and cup appearances over the course of a 14-year professional career.\nHe started his career with Wimbledon in 1999, leaving the club following its controversial move to Milton Keynes. He then had a two years spell with Southend United, one year with Yeovil Town and spent 2007 to 2009 with Leyton Orient. He made almost 300 appearances in the English Football League. He then dropped into non-League football with AFC Hornchurch in 2009, before joining Grays Athletic in 2010. The following year he moved on to Chelmsford City via Cambridge United. He signed for Woking in summer 2011, and stayed at the club for one season. Following a brief stint at Carshalton Athletic, he returned to AFC Hornchurch in September 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Ademeno", "response": ["Ademeno made his debut for Southend in the 4\u20131 win against Brentford on 14 March 2006. He came on in the 87th minute for Wayne Gray. His second first-team appearance came in the 3\u20131 defeat to Luton Town on 28 April 2007, when he came off the bench to replace Richie Foran.

He made his debut for Chelmsford on the same day as his signing was announced, replacing Wayne Gray as a 79th-minute substitute in Chelmsford's 2\u20131 away defeat at Eastleigh. Boylan made a further four appearances for Chelmsford, all of which were from the substitute's bench, before being released by the club on 30 March 2011. A day later, Boylan joined Conference South rivals Thurrock until the end of the 2010\u201311 season. He scored a hat-trick on his debut in a 3\u20130 win against Weston-super-Mare, a win that moved Thurrock four points away from the relegation zone. Boylan scored five goals in six matches for Thurrock, although the club were relegated as a result of finishing in 20th position, the final relegation place. However, they were later reprieved following the demise of Rushden & Diamonds, meaning Thurrock remained in the Conference South for the 2011\u201312 season. Boylan opted to stay at Thurrock for the 2011\u201312 campaign, scoring on the first day of the season in a 1\u20131 draw away at Salisbury City on 13 August 2011. He went on to score twelve times in 34 appearances for the club during the campaign, finishing as the club's top goalscorer. Thurrock were relegated from the Conference South after finishing in last place, and Boylan left the club in May 2012."]}, {"page": "Wayne Gray", "response": ["Wayne Gray may refer to:", "* Wayne Gray (footballer) (born 1980), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Wayne William Gray", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wayne Gray (footballer)"]}, {"page": "2007 Football League One play-off Final", "response": ["Yeovil Town had been promoted from non-League football after they finished the 2002\u201303 Football Conference season as champions, and had been promoted to the third tier of English football two seasons later.

This was Blackpool's fifth appearance in the play-offs and their fourth final: they lost to Torquay United on penalties in the 1991 Football League Fourth Division play-off Final at the old Wembley Stadium, defeated Scunthorpe United in a penalty shootout in the following season's final and beat Leyton Orient 4\u20132 in the 2001 Football League Third Division play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

During this run the Vale renewed hostilities with rivals Stoke City, recording a 1\u20131 draw at Burslem on 17 September. Their form stabilized with a four-game unbeaten run throughout November, but then no points were gained from any of the four December games. Horton attempted to sign Isaiah Rankin on loan from Bradford City, but Bill Bell rejected the move as he felt the wage bill was already too high. In January, young striker Steve Brooker was signed from Watford for a \u00a315,000 fee. Jamaican international striker Onandi Lowe also arrived on a short-team deal, and Wayne Gray joined on loan from Wimbledon. Vale then found their feet in February, and managed to avoid defeat to Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, as they lost just three of their final 21 league games. In March, Jeff Minton was transferred to Rotherham United, and Ashley Dodd arrived at Vale Park on loan from Manchester United. The next month Richard Burgess also joined the club after leaving Bromsgrove Rovers. A cup run and numerous fixture postponements meant the club were forced to play eight games in April, of which only two ended in defeat; for this achievement Horton was named Manager of the Month.
