He remained there until September 1959, when he joined Southern League team Headington United. That club changed its name to Oxford United the following summer. Mathers returned to Partick in December 1960, but did not make any more first team appearances for the club. He signed for East Stirlingshire in the summer of 1961 and retired after one season there.\nMathers played once for Scotland, against Finland in what was their final preparation match before the 1954 FIFA World Cup finals. Although named in Scotland's 22-man squad for Switzerland, Scotland decided to take only 13 of the 22 to the finals. Mathers stayed at home on reserve, along with the likes of Bobby Combe and Jimmy Binning. Inside forward George Hamilton was also on reserve, but travelled after Bobby Johnstone withdrew through injury. Mathers also represented the Scottish League once, in 1956.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1956 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|LH ||||David Mathers", "|LH ||||David Mathers"]}, {"page": "1958 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|RH ||||David Mathers"]}, {"page": "David Mathers", "response": ["David Mathers may refer to:", "*David Mathers (footballer), Scottish footballer", "*David Mathers (curler), Canadian curler"]}]}}
