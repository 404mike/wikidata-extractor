After a 0\u20130 draw at full-time, the match went into extra time, and York took the lead through a Gary Swann goal. However, Dave McKearney scored a penalty kick after Steve Tutill was adjudged to have handled the ball a minute before the end of time so the match had to be resolved in a penalty shootout. York won the shoot-out 5\u20133, with Gareth Whalley's spot kick being saved by York City's goalkeeper Dean Kiely.", "Fourteen minutes into the first half of the additional period, Barnes flicked the ball onto Swann who ran onto it and struck it into the Crewe goal, according to Frank McGhee of The Observer, \"as though scoring were the easiest thing in the world\", making it 1\u20130 to York.  Clarkson then came on for Walters in Crewe's second substitution.  Three minutes into the second half, York made their first change with Paul Stancliffe being replaced by Steve Tutill.  With a minute of extra time remaining, Tutill was adjudged to have handballed a cross from McKearney who scored the subsequent penalty to level the score at 1\u20131 and ensured the match was to be decided by a penalty shootout.  York took the first of the penalties, and the first five spot kicks were converted.  Whalley then saw his penalty saved by Kiely to his left-hand side.  It was to be the only miss of the shootout and York won 5\u20133 to secure promotion to the Second Division.", "|DF ||12||Steve Tutill || || "]}, {"page": "2000 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||5 ||Steve Tutill"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 York City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=row|Steve Tutill"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 York City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=row|Steve Tutill "]}]}}
