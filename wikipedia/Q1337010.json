After being relegated in their first Premier League season, they made an immediate return to the top flight in 2003\u201304. In 2004\u201305, Megson's successor, former Albion midfielder Bryan Robson, led the team to a last-day \"Great Escape\", when Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas, as well as bottom on the final day of the season. They failed to avoid the drop the following season, and Robson was replaced by Tony Mowbray in October 2006.

The following season, Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again, this time in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost 1\u20130 to Portsmouth. One month later, Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship, but were relegated at the end of the 2008\u201309 campaign.

Early into its run, analysis of bigger games was provided by Robbie Earle and Andy Townsend, however, as the show progressed, their appearances became more sporadic and punditry was all but scrapped from the show by 2007. Much like The Premiership, one or two \"featured\" matches would usually be the primary focus of an episode, shown in an 8-10 minute highlight format at the start of the programme. Coverage of League One, League Two and smaller Championship games was less extensive, and usually limited only to goals, red cards, injuries, and other notable incidents. Post-game interviews with managers, chairmen, players and fans were also a regular fixture.
