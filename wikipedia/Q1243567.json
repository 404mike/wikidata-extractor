Due to the lack of funds in 1908, it was forced to shut down, but reopened the following year. After Thomas Strangeways' unexpected death in 1926, the future of his research facility, then known as the Cambridge Research Hospital, was in doubt. After advocacy by Fell and collaborator F.G. Spear, the institution's trustees decided to keep the research group open, with funding from the Medical Research Council. Fell was named the new director in 1928 and the institution's name was changed to the Strangeways Research Laboratory in honor of its founder.  A great reason to appoint Fell was she did not require salary. Fell was funded by the Beit Memorial Fellowship and supported by the Royal Society Research Fellowship. The researchers who worked at the laboratory were never funded by the funds from the research lab, which were obtained from different sources. Fell served as director until 1970 when she was succeeded by Michael Abercrombie. During that time, she also maintained an active research program in tissue and organ culture."]}, {"page": "Abercrombie (surname)", "response": ["* Michael Abercrombie (1912\u20131979), British cell biologist and embryologist"]}, {"page": "Development (journal)", "response": ["*1953\u20131978: Michael Abercrombie"]}, {"page": "David Abercrombie (linguist)", "response": ["Abercrombie was born in Birkenhead on 19 December 1909.
