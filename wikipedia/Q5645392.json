Among Moore's contributions to Scottish music are his development of a revived form of the bellows-blown Scottish smallpipes; his 1985 recording of the Lowland and smallpipes, Cauld Wind Pipes, was the first contemporary complete recording of this instrument. In the 1980s and 1990s, Moore was also instrumental in exploring the links between the Scottish diaspora music of Canada's Cape Breton Island, and earlier Scottish traditions. Moore taught at Cape Breton's Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts, and in 1996 returned to South Uist, Scotland, to form his Ceolas musical summer school, which included Cape Breton instructors and influences.Hamish is father of Fin Moore, also a Scottish smallpiper and border piper.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fionn mac Cumhaill", "response": ["In 1987 Harvey Holton (1949-2010) published Finn with the Three Tygers Press, Cambridge.

Competitive solo piping is currently popular among many aspiring pipers, some of whom travel from as far as Australia to attend Scottish competitions. Other pipers have chosen to explore more creative usages of the instrument. Different types of bagpipes have also seen a resurgence since the 70s, as the historical border pipes and Scottish smallpipes have been resuscitated and now attract a thriving alternative piping community.Hamish Moore of Dunkeld \u2013 maker of Scottish smallpipes and Highland bagpipes  Two of Scotland's most highly regarded pipers are Gordon Duncan and Fred Morrison."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Hamish Moore, maker and player of Scottish smallpipes"]}, {"page": "List of nontraditional bagpipe usage", "response": ["* Scottish Duo Hamish Moore and Dick Lee recorded two albums, available on Greentrax, in the early 1990s."]}, {"page": "Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies", "response": ["*Hamish Moore, (grad. 1975),http://www.pipersgathering.org: Instructors maker, musician and teacher of Scottish Bagpipes, especially the Scottish Smallpipes."]}, {"page": "List of bagpipe makers", "response": ["| Hamish Moore"]}, {"page": "Hamish", "response": ["* Hamish Moore, Scottish maker, musician and teacher"]}, {"page": "Nigel Eaton", "response": ["Eaton has collaborated and recorded with a wide range of other artists including Afro Celt Sound System, Loreena McKennitt, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, Scott Walker, Shelleyan Orphan, New London Consort, Heidi Berry, Gary Kemp, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blue Aeroplanes, Martin Simpson, The Palladian Ensemble, Moya Brennan, Robert Plant, Maddy Prior, June Tabor, Silly Sisters, The Tavener Consort, Jake Walton, and Hamish Moore."]}, {"page": "Maggie MacInnes", "response": ["* Hamish Moore & Dick Lee \u2013 The Bees Knees (1991)"]}, {"page": "Colin Ross (pipemaker)", "response": ["In the late 1970s, he was the Curator of the Black Gate Museum, Newcastle, which then housed the Cocks collection of historic bagpipes.
