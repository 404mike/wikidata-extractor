She is the author of six novels, and has also written four works of non fiction.

Shortly thereafter he and Norma moved to a larger house (Finings) in Great Stukeley; Major generally spent his weekends there, and weekdays at a rented flat in Durand Gardens, Stockwell. Major was invited to join the prestigious 'Blue Chip' group of rising stars in the Conservative Party, and he was promoted to Treasury Whip in October 1984. It was later revealed (in 2002) that during this period Major had conducted an affair with Edwina Currie, a Conservative backbencher and later Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Health and Social Security; the affair ended in 1988.\"Major and Currie had four-year affair\" , BBC News Online, 28 September 2002.\"Currie interview in full\" , BBC News Online, 2 October 2002.

Commentators were quick to refer to Major's previous 'Back to Basics' platform to throw charges of hypocrisy. An obituary of Tony Newton in The Daily Telegraph claimed that if Newton had not kept the affair a closely guarded secret \"it is highly unlikely that Major would have become prime minister\".", "During his leadership of the Conservative Party, Major was portrayed as honest (\"Honest John\") but unable to exert effective control over his fractious party. However his polite, easy-going manner was initially well received by both his supporters and his critics. Major's appearance was noted for its greyness, his prodigious philtrum, and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in Spitting Image, Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a literally grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying \"nice peas, dear\", while at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague Virginia Bottomley \u2013 an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with Edwina Currie, which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring \"oh dear\". Long-standing Conservative MP Enoch Powell, when asked about Major, stated \"I simply find myself asking \u2013 does he really exist?\", whereas on the left Labour's Alastair Campbell dismissed him as a \"piece of lettuce that passes for prime minister\" and Labour MP Tony Banks said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council. Every time he gets up now I keep thinking, 'What on earth is Councillor Major doing?'
