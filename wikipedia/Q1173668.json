Supposedly a play by Arthur Serious, this sketch parodies a typically miserable family Christmas, with David Battley complaining about everything and suggesting \"a nice game of suicide\". Eric Idle relates a charming childhood memory that quickly turns nasty, and Neil Innes arrives as a postman, with an unusual present in the shape of a sexy showgirl, prompting Battley's remark \"they make lovely presents, women\".

The documentary's narrator decides that \"the little man from the off-licence\" (Woolf) is to blame, not just for Sutcliffe's misfortune, but for everything, including Leicester City Football Club's failure to win the FA Cup, racial prejudice and the unequal distribution of wealth.

A man (David Battley) is despondent after he scores zero in an IQ test, but since he managed to get his name right at the top of the paper, the examiner (Eric Idle) gives him two points and membership to the Cretin Club, whose perks include cufflinks, a club tie and an 'I Am A Cretin' T-shirt.
