During a game against Dunfermline Athletic, Aluko won a penalty which was converted by Nikica Jelavi\u0107 and which proved to be the decisive goal. Dunfermline manager Jim McIntyre claimed it was \"never a penalty\" as there was no contact, and that Aluko was \"obviously trying to get his team into a lead\". Former referee Kenny Clark said that, while there was contact, it was \"not enough to cause a man to spill a pint in a pub far less to fall over\". After a club appeal had failed, Rangers manager Ally McCoist said he was \"shocked and extremely angry\" at the decision of the panel, which included former referee Jim McCluskey, who McCoist was critical of in particular, saying \"his decision making hasn't improved any since he stopped refereeing\"."]}, {"page": "John McStay", "response": ["He had an on-field altercation with Duncan Ferguson during a Scottish Premier Division encounter between Rangers and Raith Rovers at Ibrox Stadium on 16 April 1994.

The second half started in a similar way to the first, with neither team in control. United felt they should have been awarded a penalty in the 53rd minute when Cuellar appeared to pull back Christian Kalvenes in the box, but referee Kenny Clark inexplicably waved play on. Walter Smith made another substitution in the 61st minute when the left back Papac was replaced by Striker Kris Boyd. Darcheville headed the ball into the net in the 77th minute from a quickly-taken free-kick, but the referee decided that Ferguson had taken the set-piece too quickly. Rangers scored the equalizing goal with 6 minutes of normal time remaining, Mark Kerr attempted a pass back to his goalkeeper but Boyd was there to score the goal that would take the match into Extra time."]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["During Rangers' league encounter against Raith Rovers at Ibrox on 16 April 1994, Duncan Ferguson headbutted the visitors' John McStay in the south-west corner of the Ibrox pitch.
