Wellman's Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds combined the elements of Holmes canon with H.G. Wells's science fiction classic and describes Holmes' and Watson's adventures in the Martian-occupied London (in passing, the book also asserts that Holmes had a long-lasting romantic relationship with Mrs. Hudson, but the puritanical Dr. Watson never noticed it). Laurie R. King recreates Sherlock Holmes in her Mary Russell series (starting with The Beekeeper's Apprentice), set during World War I and the 1920s. Her Holmes is (semi-)retired in Sussex, where he gradually trains a teenage Russell as his apprentice. The series includes 11 full length novels and a short story tie-in with a book from her Kate Martinelli series, The Art of Detection. Repercussions is a short comic story by Dwight Baldwin and J. M. DeSantis in the literary trade paperback Iconic (Summer 2009) by members of the Comicbook Artists Guild. In it, Holmes and Watson are on the trail of the legendary Jack the Ripper. Another story which pits Holmes and Watson against Jack the Ripper is Lyndsay Faye's Dust and Shadow (2009). In Robert Wilton's 'The Adventure of the Distracted Thane', Holmes investigates the assassination of King Duncan I of Scotland, previously explored by William Shakespeare in Macbeth (which itself, according to this interpretation, featured Dr. Watson)."]}, {"page": "Thomas Rainsborough", "response": ["He plays a minor but crucial role in the historical novel Traitor's Field, by Robert Wilton, published in 2013."]}, {"page": "Cultural depictions of Charles I of England", "response": ["* In Traitor's Field by Robert Wilton, published in May 2013 by Bloomsbury Publishing, the reader follows him from his imprisonment in Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight to his trial and, ultimately, execution in Whitehall."]}, {"page": "Cultural depictions of Charles II of England", "response": ["*The young Charles is a character in Traitor's Field by Robert Wilton (2013), following him from the aftermath of the Battle of Worcester in 1651 to his flight into exile on the continent."]}, {"page": "Robert wilton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Wilton (author)"]}, {"page": "Napoleonic Wars in fiction", "response": ["*Robert Wilton's Treason's Tide (Corvus, 2011) is an espionage tale set in 1805.
