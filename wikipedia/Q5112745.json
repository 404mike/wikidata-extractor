He was born in Wigan, Greater Manchester. His short career was plagued by a persistent back problem which eventually forced his premature retirement.\nLiptrot made his first-class debut early in the 1999 season against Oxford University. Although he took only the wicket of tail-ender Tom Hicks in each innings, he was retained in the Worcestershire side for the County Championship matches which followed. His best performance was later in April, when he took 5-51 on the only day of four in which play was possible in a weather-ruined game against Surrey. After mid-June, however, he dropped out of the first team, although he did play three Youth Tests and three Youth ODIs for England U-19s with fair success against their Australian counterparts.\n2000 saw Liptrot still in the seconds, failing to capitalise on one first-class opportunity in June when he went wicketless against the touring West Indians. However, some good performances followed at Second XI level, including two seven-wicket innings hauls, and these saw him force his way into the first team in mid-August. At last making his first List A appearance against Sussex, he took the wicket of opposing captain Chris Adams, but was frustrated as only 3.1 overs were bowled before the match was called off. Over the next few days, however, he recorded his career-best returns in both first-class cricket (6-44 against Warwickshire) and the one-day format (3-44 against Kent).\nLiptrot bowled more in 2001 than in any other season, and although he never dismissed more than three batsmen in an innings he nevertheless managed to total 35 first-class wickets at 27.60 over the course of the summer. This promise was never fulfilled: he appeared hardly at all in 2002 and 2003 (though he did play a handful of Twenty20 games in the latter year) and after the end of the 2003 season he announced his injury-enforced retirement from the game.\nLiptrot is now pursuing a career in the rail industry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Liptrot", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Liptrot"]}, {"page": "Liptrot", "response": ["* Christopher Liptrot (b. 1980), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Liptrot, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Liptrot"]}]}}
