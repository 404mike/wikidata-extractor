Hordern immediately accepted the title role but later said that it was a character he never much cared to play.Hordern, p. 138. Writing about Miller in his autobiography, Hordern stated: \"It was one of the most exhilarating and funny experiences I have had in the theatre.\"Hordern, pp. 138\u2013139. Miller recruited Frank Middlemass to play the fool,Croall, p. 64. but contrary to tradition, Miller made the character an intimate of Lear's as opposed to a servant, something which Shakespearean purists found difficult to accept.Hordern, p. 139. Miller decided to further defy convention by concentrating on the relationships between the characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume; he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for the fear of detracting from the characterisations and the sentimentality of the storyline. As such, the sets were bleak and the costumes more so; it was a style that was also used when the play was televised by the BBC later that decade.", "Hordern made a return to the London stage in 1987 after a four-year absence. The play in which he starred, You Never Can Tell, transferred to the Haymarket Theatre that December having made its debut at the Theatr Clwyd in Wales earlier that year.Hordern, p. 158. It was the second time the actor had appeared in the play, the first being back in Bristol fifty years previously when he starred as the youthful lead, Valentine. This time he was cast as William, the elderly waiter, a part which he considered to be \"a real hell to play\", partly because of the many meals he had to serve up on stage, whilst at the same time trying to remember the complex script. He enjoyed the play immensely and was thrilled at its successful run. His engagement also gave him a chance to reunite with some old friends, including Irene Worth, Michael Denison and Frank Middlemass, all of whom were in the cast. Hordern admitted that, on the whole, the experience made him feel \"a little happier\" about life.Hordern, pp. 158\u2013159."]}, {"page": "2000 in film", "response": ["| The 10th Kingdom || NBC / Hallmark Entertainment || David Carson, Herbert Wise (directors); Simon Moore (screenplay); Kimberly Williams, John Larroquette, Scott Cohen, Dianne Wiest, Rutger Hauer, Ed O'Neill, Camryn Manheim, Ann-Margret, Daniel Lapaine, Hugh O'Gorman, Dawnn Lewis, Jeremiah Birkett, Warwick Davis, Robert Hardy, Edward Jewesbury, John Hallam, Edward Highmore, Frank Middlemass, Peter Vaughan, Lucy Punch, Natasha Collins, John Shrapnel, Jimmy Nail, Aden Gillett, Gudrun Ure, Amelda Brown, Liz May Brice, Moira Lister, Timothy Bateson, Jeffry Wickham, Sheila Steafel, Adam James, Nigel Whitmey, Leon Herbert, James Cosmo, Adam Levy, Bob Barrett, Douglas Blackwell, Marcus Clarke || Fantasy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| Dreamchild || Thorn EMI || Gavin Millar (director); Dennis Potter (screenplay); Coral Browne, Peter Gallagher, Ian Holm, Jane Asher, Nicola Cowper, Caris Corfman, Amelia Shankley, Alan Bennett, Ken Campbell, Tony Haygarth, Fulton Mackay, Frank Middlemass, Julie Walters, Big Mick, Ron Mueck, Karen Prell, Michael Sundin, Steve Whitmire || Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Island || Universal Pictures / Zanuck/Brown Company || Michael Ritchie (director); Peter Benchley (screenplay); Michael Caine, David Warner, Angela Punch McGregor, Frank Middlemass, Don Henderson, Dudley Sutton, Colin Jeavons, Jeffrey Frank, Zakes Mokae, Brad Sullivan, Reg Evans || Action, Adventure, Thriller || Live action"]}, {"page": "Henry VI, Part 1", "response": ["Inspired by the notion that the political intrigues behind the Wars of the Roses often seemed like playground squabbles, Howell and production designer Oliver Bayldon staged the four plays in a single set resembling a children's adventure playground. However, little attempt was made at realism. For example, Bayldon did not disguise the parquet flooring (\"it stops the set from literally representing [...] it reminds us we are in a modern television studio\"Quoted in Graham Holderness, \"Radical potentiality and institutional closure: Shakespeare in film and television\", in Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield (eds.), Political Shakespeare: Essays in Cultural Materialism, 2nd edition (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1984), 222), and in all four productions, the title of the play is displayed within the set itself (on banners in 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI (where it is visible throughout the entire first scene), on a shroud in 3 Henry VI, and written on a chalkboard by Richard himself in Richard III). Many critics felt these set design choices lent the production an air of Brechtian verfremdungseffekt.Neil Taylor, \"Two Types of Television Shakespeare\", Shakespeare Survey, 39 (1986), 106\u2013107Dennis Bingham, \"Jane Howell's First Tetralogy: Brechtian Break-out or Just Good Television?\", in J.C. Bulman and H.R. Coursen (eds.), Shakespeare on Television: An Anthology of Essays and Reviews (New Hampshire: University Press of New England, 1988), 221\u2013229 Stanley Wells wrote of the set that it was intended to invite the viewer to \"accept the play's artificiality of language and action,\" Michael Hattaway describes it as \"anti-illusionist,\"Hattaway (1990: 51) Susan Willis argues that the set allows the productions \"to reach theatrically toward the modern world\"Susan Willis. The BBC Shakespeare Plays: Making the Televised Canon (Carolina: North Carolina Press, 1991), 28 and Ronald Knowles writes \"a major aspect of the set was the subliminal suggestion of childlike anarchy, role-playing, rivalry, game and vandalism, as if all culture were precariously balanced on the shaky foundations of atavistic aggression and power-mad possession.\"Ronald Knowles (ed.) King Henry VI, Part 2 (London: Arden, 1999), 22. See also Burns (2000: 306) Another element of verfremdungseffekt in this production is seen when Gloucester and Winchester encounter one another at the Tower, both are on horseback, but the horses they ride are hobby-horses, which the actors (David Burke and Frank Middlemass respectively) cause to pivot and prance as they speak. The ridiculousness of this situation works to \"effectively undercut their characters' dignity and status.\"Kingsley-Smith (2005: lxvii) The \"anti-illusionist\" set was also used as a means of political commentary; as the four plays progressed, the set decayed and became more and more dilapidated as social order became more fractious.Roger Warren, (ed.) Henry VI, Part Two (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), 15 In the same vein, the costumes become more and more monotone as the four plays move on. The First Part of Henry the Sixt features brightly coloured costumes that clearly distinguish the various combatants from one another, but by The Tragedy of Richard III, everyone fights in similarly coloured dark costumes, with little to differentiate one army from another.Mich\u00e8le Willems, \"Verbal-Visual, Verbal-Pictorial, or Textual-Televisual? Reflections on the BBC Shakespeare Series\", Shakespeare Survey, 39 (1986), 101 Graham Holderness saw Howell's non-naturalistic production as something of a reaction to the BBC's adaptation of the Henriad in seasons one and two, which had been directed by David Giles in the traditional and straightforward manner favoured by then series producer Cedric Messina; \"where Messina saw the history plays conventionally as orthodox Tudor historiography, and [David Giles] employed dramatic techniques that allow that ideology a free and unhampered passage to the spectator, Jane Howell takes a more complex view of the first tetralogy as, simultaneously, a serious attempt at historical interpretation, and as a drama with a peculiarly modern relevance and contemporary application. The plays, to this director, are not a dramatisation of the Elizabethan World Picture but a sustained interrogation of residual and emergent ideologies in a changing society [...] This awareness of the multiplicity of potential meanings in the play required a decisive and scrupulous avoidance of television or theatrical naturalism: methods of production should operate to open the plays out, rather than close them into the immediately recognisable familiarity of conventional Shakespearean production.\"Graham Holderness, \"Radical potentiality and institutional closure: Shakespeare in film and television\", in Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield (eds.), Political Shakespeare: Essays in Cultural Materialism, 2nd edition (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1984), 221An analysis of the entire tetralogy can be found in Susan Willis.

In 1975, he remounted that same production for the BBC Play of the Month, a heavily truncated version, which happened to be the BBC's last Shakespeare production prior to the beginning of the Television Shakespeare. During his producership, Miller tried to persuade the BBC to use the Play of the Month production as their Lear, but they refused, saying a new production had to be done. At the end of the fourth season, Miller's last as producer, his contract stipulated that he still had one production to direct. In-coming producer Shaun Sutton offered him Love's Labour's Lost, but Miller wanted to do one of the three remaining tragedies; Lear, Macbeth or Coriolanus. He had never directed Macbeth or Coriolanus before, but he felt so comfortable with Lear that he went with it. The production was much the same as his 1969/1975 version, with the same two leading actors, the same costumes design, the same lighting, and the same design concept. The only significant difference is that more of the text is used in the latter production. Miller used a \"board and drapes\" approach to the play; all interiors were shot on or near a plain wooden platform whilst all exteriors were shot against a cycloramic curtain with dark tarpaulins. As such, although exteriors and interiors were clearly distinguished from one another, both were nonrepresentational.Willis, p. 128. To enhance the starkness of the look of the production, Miller had lighting technician John Treays desaturate the colour by 30 per cent.Willis, p. 129. Miller also used colour to connect characters; the Fool wears white makeup which washes off during the storm, Edgar wears a white mask when he challenges Edmund to fight, and Cordelia wears white make-up after her death. Similarly, the Fool has red feathers in his hat, Edgar has a red tunic, and Cordelia's red welts on her neck stand out starkly against the white of her skin after her death.Willis, p. 130.", "Another element of verfremdungseffekt in this production is seen when Gloucester and Winchester encounter one another at the Tower; both are on horseback, but the horses they ride are hobbyhorses, which actors David Burke and Frank Middlemass cause to pivot and prance as they speak.
