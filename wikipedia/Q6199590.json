Despite Bentley proving a worthy successor to Bloomer, breaking Bloomer's records of Most Goals in a League Season as he struck 27 goals in 35 matches, Derby struggled to challenge for promotion, finishing just 6th in the table, eight points off of Champions Bradford City. The following campaign saw Derby reach another FA Cup Semi Final, where they lost out 2\u20131 to Bristol City in a replay, but could only finish 5th in the league, despite another exceptional season from Bentley, who broke another Bloomer record, this time of most League and Cup Goals in a Single Season, as he hit 32 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 victory over Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup Fourth Round. Derby again improved by one place in the 1909/10 season, finishing fourth, just one point behind Champions Manchester City, and behind Oldham Athletic and Hull City on goal-difference. The nickname of 'The Busy B's' was given to the attacking trio of Bentley, Horace Barnes and Jimmy Bauchop, who, between them, accounted for 59 of Derby's 72 league goals that season, with Bentley becoming the first ever Derby player to hit thirty goals in a single campaign."]}, {"page": "List of Crystal Palace F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Jimmy Bauchop||||FW||1907\u20131909||46||25||||"]}, {"page": "List of Lincoln City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["All players who have made between 25 and 99 appearances in senior first-team matches for Lincoln City, in league or cup competition, are listed below.
