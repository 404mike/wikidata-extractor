She was among the first to begin a campaign to abolish the use of the harmonium in Indian music. She noted that keyed instruments and their rigid notes had caused the decline in vocal skills in Western music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Microtonal music", "response": ["Microtonal music can refer to any music containing microtones. The words \"microtone\" and \"microtonal\" were coined before 1912 by Maud MacCarthy Mann in order to avoid the misnomer \"quarter tone\" when speaking of the srutis of Indian music. Prior to this time the term \"quarter tone\" was used, confusingly, not only for an interval actually half the size of a semitone, but also for all intervals (considerably) smaller than a semitone. It may have been even slightly earlier, perhaps as early as 1895, that the Mexican composer Juli\u00e1n Carrillo, writing in Spanish or French, coined the terms microtono/micro-ton and microtonalismo/micro-tonalit\u00e9."]}, {"page": "Enrique Fern\u00e1ndez Arb\u00f3s", "response": ["His many pupils included Maud MacCarthy (later Omananda Puri), the wife of the composer John Foulds."]}, {"page": "A World Requiem", "response": ["Foulds wrote the work between 1919 and 1921, and conceived it as a memorial to the dead of all nations in the wake of the First World War. The text (in English), assembled by his wife Maud MacCarthy, to whom the score is dedicated, is not liturgical, though it uses sections of the Requiem Mass plus several other Biblical passages as well as excerpts from John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, a poem by the Hindu poet Kabir and a few passages she wrote herself. There are 20 movements arranged in two parts of 10 movements each, though some movements are quite brief.", "It was premiered under the auspices of the Royal British Legion on Armistice Night, 11 November 1923 in the Royal Albert Hall by up to 1,250 instrumentalists and singers; the latter were called the Cenotaph Choir. The soloists were Herbert Heyner, Ida Cooper, Olga Haley and William Heseltine. The programme-book for that occasion proclaimed on its cover that the work was 'A Cenotaph in Sound'Cover reproduced in Chandos CD booklet. and it is likely that Foulds wished to present his work as a musical equivalent of the Cenotaph recently erected in Whitehall and designed by his friend Sir Edwin Lutyens. The performance brought Foulds such popular acclaim that after his death Maud MacCarthy was able to publish a book devoted to the positive responses to the work, though critical reaction was mixed. The work was repeated from 1924 to 1926 and constituted the first Festivals of Remembrance."]}, {"page": "Maud MacCarthy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Maud MacCarthy (Omananda Puri)"]}, {"page": "Maud McCarthy (Omananda Puri)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Maud MacCarthy (Omananda Puri)"]}, {"page": "Ethel Merston", "response": ["Financially independent, she traveled the world, settling in India in 1934.

It was a school of general education, but music and art were given a prominent place in the curriculum. Drawing upon her network of associates, Weisse had many musical celebrities visit the school, including Joseph Joachim, Maud MacCarthy, flautist Louis Fleury and cellist Pablo Casals.
