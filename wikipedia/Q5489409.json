He soon made his presence felt when he punched club legend Dave Mackay during training, though no long-term rift developed because of the incident. Spurs went on to have a good 1966\u201367 season though, finishing third in the league and beating Millwall (after a replay), Portsmouth, Bristol City, Birmingham City (after a replay) and Nottingham Forest to reach the 1967 FA Cup Final to face his former club Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. Spurs won the cup with a 2\u20131 victory, Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul providing the goals before Bobby Tambling scored a late consolation goal for Chelsea. Ironically, earlier in the season Venables had bet \u00a325 on Chelsea to win the cup at odds of 25/1, which would have paid out \u00a3500 if Spurs had lost the game, exactly the same figure as the \u00a3500 cup bonus he would receive for winning the match; in fact after tax deductions, Venables would have been better off financially if Chelsea had won."]}, {"page": "Martin Chivers", "response": ["In January 1968, Tottenham Hotspur manager Bill Nicholson signed Chivers for a club record fee of \u00a3125,000, which also made him the country's most expensive player at that time.
