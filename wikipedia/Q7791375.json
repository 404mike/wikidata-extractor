He played as an outside left.\nJones was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. He signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers, initially as an amateur, in 1898 and spent several years with the club, but never played for them in the Football League. A spell with Shrewsbury Town preceded his joining Small Heath of the Football League First Division in 1904. He played three times during the 1904\u201305 season, twice in the League and once in the FA Cup, as a replacement for Oakey Field, but was out of his depth at that level, and returned to non-league football with Shifnal Town in 1905.", "link_mentions": {}}}
