This was due to added competition for the defensive midfield position with Richard Smallwood, Grant Leadbitter and Adam Clayton. However, in a 4\u20130 win over Brentford on 20 September, he was sent\u2013off \"for an over the top tackle\", leading the referee giving him a straight red card. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the first-team from suspension, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2\u20130 win over Fulham on 2 October. Whitehead captained the side for the first time in the league, in a 1\u20131 draw against Watford on 25 October. However, throughout the 2014\u201315 season, Whitehead was demoted to the substitute bench. But he did provide cover, playing twice at right\u2013back and six times in central midfield. He also captained the side once again this season against Sheffield Wednesday on 28 February, which ended in a 2\u20130 defeat. In the Championship play-offs, Whitehead was featured three times as a right\u2013back, including the play-off final at Wembley, where they lost 2\u20130 to Norwich City.

Once again, he helped the club go on a fourteen matches unbeaten run between 1 September 2012 and 17 November 2012, resulting in them being placed at the top of the table at one point. In a match against Huddersfield Town on 22 December 2012, Speroni performed well throughout the match and saved a penalty from Adam Clayton but he conceded the equaliser goal, in a 1\u20131 draw. After the match, manager Ian Holloway defended Speroni's performance and said if it weren't for him, Crystal Palace would have lost the match. He then made his 300th appearance for the club, in a 4\u20131 loss against Birmingham City on 29 March 2013. Speroni helped Crystal Palace qualify for the Championship play\u2013offs after beating Peterborough United on the last game of the season. He played in both legs of the play\u2013offs semi\u2013final against Brighton & Hove Albion and kept a clean sheet, as the club won 2\u20130 on aggregate. In the Football League Championship play-off Final, Speroni started in goal throughout the match and played 120 minutes, as Crystal Palace beat Watford 1\u20130 to seal their promotion return to the English top tier after an eight-year absence.

Naylor played in Leeds' Football League Trophy second leg Northern Area final match against Carlisle United and Naylor was at fault for one of the goals conceded when his error let in Adam Clayton to slot the ball home for Carlisle. Leeds were knocked out of the Football League Trophy after losing 6\u20135 on penalties. After a solid start in defence, Leeds have continued to leak goals with 19 goals being conceded in the nine games since the Manchester United victory. He scored two goals against Yeovil Town 5 April 2010. On 1 May 2010, during a game in which a win would have seen Leeds promoted, Naylor scored an own goal which gave Charlton Athletic the victory, and ensured that Leeds' season came down to the final match. Due to a hamstring injury sustained in the pregame warmup, Naylor missed the final game of the season against Bristol Rovers. Despite his absence, Leeds went on to win the game, after stand-in captain Jermaine Beckford scored the match winning goal to ensure a 2\u20131 victory for Leeds.

Following his debut, Mills started each of Nottingham Forest's first eight matches of the season, scoring twice, before an injury sustained shortly after equalizing against Middlesbrough on 19 September 2015, forcing him to miss the club's next away match Huddersfield Town. He returned to the starting eleven in Nottingham Forest's next game at home to Hull City on 3 October 2015, but received a straight red card from referee Nigel Miller in the 87th minute of the game following an aerial challenge with Hull's on-loan Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom, as the club lost the game 1\u20130. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the starting line\u2013up as captain against Sheffield Wednesday on 31 October 2015, as Nottingham Forest lost 1\u20130. Since returning to the first team, Mills regained his first team place, playing in the centre\u2013back position and resumed his captain duties in the absence of Chris Cohen and Andy Reid. On 5 December 2015, he scored twice in a 3\u20130 defeat of Fulham, with a third headed effort in injury time hitting the crossbar. Following his performance, Mills was named Team of the Week. Having played an integral role in an unbeaten December for the club, he was nominated for the SkyBet Championship Player of the Month Award on 7 January 2016, but lost out to Adam Clayton. Five days later on 12 January 2016, just after the announcement, he scored his fifth goal of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw against Birmingham City.

He stated that the promise of being played in his favoured position of centre forward was a major factor in his decision to join the club. Three months later both he and teammate Adam Clayton were dropped from the first team amid rumours of a training ground bust-up between the pair where Paterson was alleged to have punched Clayton. On 23 November, both players were re-instated to the first team against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough Stadium, in which Paterson scored his first goal of the season, set-up by Clayton; following the goal Paterson celebrated by re-enacting a 'mock-fight' with Clayton. Paterson went on to fall behind Nahki Wells and James Vaughan in the pecking order however, and on 15 March he joined Bristol City on loan for the rest of the season. Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill had previously tried to sign Paterson when he was manager of Portsmouth. He made his debut for the \"Robins\" in a 0\u20130 draw with Swindon Town at Ashton Gate Stadium on 15 March, and admitted he was \"disappointed not to score\" after missing a good chance to win the game.
