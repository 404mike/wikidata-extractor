He is a leading member of the Law in Context movement, and has contributed especially to jurisprudence, evidence and proof, legal method, legal education, and intellectual history. He has focused recently on \"globalization\" and legal theory.Central themes of Twining's contributions to legal matters include the variety and complexity of legal phenomena; the proposition that many so-called \u201cglobal\u201d processes and patterns are sub-global, linked to empires, diasporas, alliances, and legal traditions; that diffusion, legal pluralism, and surface law are important topics for both analytical and empirical jurisprudence; that, in a world characterized by profound diversity of beliefs and radical poverty, the discipline of law needs to engage with problems of constructing just and workable supra-national institutions and practices; and that adopting a global perspective challenges some of the main working assumptions of Western traditions of academic law.\nAt the start of his career, Twining taught for seven years in Sudan and Tanzania. He has maintained an interest in Eastern Africa, and more broadly the Commonwealth. He has studied and taught in several leading UK and American law schools as well.  Twining is currently a visiting faculty member at the University of Miami School of Law.\nTwining has held chairs in Belfast and Warwick.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "H. L. A.
