The Musical Times called him \"the prince of accompanists\". As a composer he wrote throughout his career, many of his works being well received, though few are regularly performed in the 21st century.\nIn his career as a conductor, which began in 1904, Harty was particularly noted as an interpreter of the music of Berlioz. From 1920 to 1933 he was the chief conductor of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester, which he returned to the high standards and critical acclaim that it had enjoyed under its founder, Charles Hall\u00e9. His last permanent post was with the London Symphony Orchestra, but it lasted only two years, from 1932 to 1934. During his conducting career, Harty made some recordings with his orchestras. Shortly after his dismissal by the LSO, Harty began to suffer the symptoms of a brain tumour. After surgery, he resumed his career until 1940, but the tumour returned to cause his death at the age of 61.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1900s (decade)", "response": ["*Hamilton Harty"]}, {"page": "List of Irish people", "response": ["* Hamilton Harty \u2013 composer and arranger"]}, {"page": "Lionel Tertis", "response": ["| rowspan=\"3\" | George Frideric Handel (1685\u20131759) || Arietta || published 1910; transcription (violin and piano) by Hamilton Harty of \"Si che lieta goder\u00f2\" from Rodrigo; viola part by Tertis"]}, {"page": "Piano quintet", "response": ["*Hamilton Harty"]}, {"page": "William Walton", "response": ["Walton's first major composition after Belshazzar's Feast was his First Symphony.

Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the London Symphony Orchestra.

The orchestra first rehearsed at 9.30am on 4 September 1920, in the band room at the Birmingham City Police's Steelhouse Lane station. The CBO's first concert was given under Matthews' baton as part of the Sunday series at the Theatre Royal on 5 September 1920, with the first piece of music performed being Granville Bantock's Saul. After two months of preparing the orchestra with the popular concerts, the inaugural concert of the Symphony Concerts series was given at the Town Hall on 10 November 1920, with Edward Elgar conducting a concert of his own works, including his Cello Concerto with Felix Salmond as the soloist. The first season continued with a remarkable series of programmes, including Ralph Vaughan Williams conducting his own London Symphony, Hamilton Harty conducting Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, Adrian Boult conducting Rachmaninov's Second Symphony, Landon Ronald conducting Brahms' Second Symphony and Jean Sibelius conducting his own Third Symphony. Two features that would become longstanding traditions for the orchestra were also established during this first year: performances of then-recent works by Holst, Vaughan Williams and Bax saw a strong representation of new music in the orchestra's programmes; and from February 1921 the orchestra's commitment to musical education was underlined with a series of concerts for city schoolchildren held in the Town Hall on Saturday afternoons."]}, {"page": "Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["Godfrey remains the longest serving principal conductor of the orchestra, and his stewardship ensured that, unlike many of the seaside orchestras that functioned from the end of the 19th century up until the outbreak of World War II, the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra established an ongoing tradition of music making.

"]}, {"page": "Music of Ireland", "response": ["Apart from the harper-composers of the 16th century, composers in the 16th and 17th century usually came from a Protestant Anglo-Irish background, as due to the discrimination of Catholics no formal musical education was available to them. Composers were often associated with either Dublin Castle or one of the Dublin cathedrals (St Patrick's and Christ Church). These include immigrants in the 18th century such as Johann Sigismund Cousser, Matthew Dubourg, and Tommaso Giordani. Thomas Roseingrave and his brother Ralph were prominent Irish baroque composers. Among the next generation of composers were the Cork-born Philip Cogan (1750\u20131833), a prominent composer of piano music including concertos, John Andrew Stevenson (1761\u20131833), who is best known for his publications of Irish Melodies with poet Thomas Moore, who also wrote operas, religious music, catches, glees, odes, and songs. In the early 19th century Irish-born composers dominated English-language opera in England and Ireland, including Charles Thomas Carter (c.1735\u20131804), Michael Kelly (1762\u20131826), Thomas Simpson Cooke (1782\u20131848), William Henry Kearns (1794\u20131846), Joseph Augustine Wade (1801\u20131845) and, later in the century, Michael W. Balfe (1808\u20131870) and William Vincent Wallace (1812\u20131865). John Field (1782\u20131837) has been credited with the creation of the Nocturne form, which influenced Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. John William Glover (1815\u20131899), Joseph Robinson (1815\u20131898) and Robert Prescott Stewart (1825\u20131894) kept Irish classical music in Dublin alive in the 19th century, while mid-19th-century emigrants include George William Torrance and George Alexander Osborne. Charles Villiers Stanford (1852\u20131924) and Hamilton Harty (1879\u20131941) were among the last emigrants in Irish music, combining a late romantic musical language with Irish folklorism. Their contemporary in Ireland was the Italian immigrant Michele Esposito (1855\u20131929), a figure of seminal importance in Irish music who arrived in Ireland in 1882. The years after Irish independence were a difficult period in which composers tried to find an identifiable Irish voice in an anti-British climate, which included ressentiments against classical music as such. The development of Irish broadcasting in the 1920s and the gradual enlargement of the Radio \u00c9ireann Orchestra in the late 1930s improved the situation. Important composers in these years were John F. Larchet (1884\u20131967), Ina Boyle (1889\u20131967), Arthur Duff (1899\u20131956), Aloys Fleischmann (1910\u20131992), Frederick May (1911\u20131985), Joan Trimble (1915\u20132000), and Brian Boydell (1917\u20132000). The middle decades of the 20th century were also shaped by A.J. Potter (1918\u20131980), Gerard Victory (1921\u20131995), James Wilson (1922\u20132005), Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada (1931\u20131971), John Kinsella (b. 1932), and Se\u00f3irse Bodley (b. 1933). Prominent names among the older generation of living composers in Ireland today are Frank Corcoran (b. 1944), Eric Sweeney (b. 1948), John Buckley (b. 1951), Gerald Barry (b. 1952), Raymond Deane (b. 1953), Patrick Cassidy (b. 1956), and Fergus Johnston (b. 1959) (see also List of Irish classical composers)."]}, {"page": "Royal Hillsborough", "response": ["*The composer and conductor Hamilton Harty (1879\u20131941), whose father William Harty was organist in the Parish Church, was born in Hillsborough."]}, {"page": "Sea Pictures", "response": ["*Clara Butt, Unidentified Orchestra, Hamilton Harty \"Where corals lie\" only.
