He was noted as playing in bands formed by ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan, and later worked extensively in composing soundtracks for film, television and commercials. Learning piano as a child, by the age of 13 he was earning money playing at weddings and birthdays in his neighbourhood of the East End of London. He went on to play in numerous dance bands, jazz ensembles and also became a session musician. His main musical passion is jazz and he has made several well-received albums together with his big band, the Mask Orchestra. He has also founded an independent record label, Provocateur.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Ham", "response": ["*Colin Towns, composer and keyboardist"]}, {"page": "Whitesnake", "response": ["In July 1978, the band (now known simply as Whitesnake) entered Central Recorders in London to begin work on their first proper studio album with Martin Birch again producing. The recording and mixing only took ten days. Towards the end of the sessions, Pete Solley's keyboard parts were completely replaced by Coverdale's former Deep Purple bandmate Jon Lord, who agreed to join Whitesnake after much coaxing from Coverdale. Colin Towns and Tony Ashton were also approached, having previously played with fellow Deep Purple offshoots the Ian Gillan Band and Paice Ashton Lord, respectively. Whitesnake's debut album Trouble was released in October 1978, and it reached number 50 on the UK Albums Chart. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Eduardo Rivadavia stated: \"A few unexpected oddities throw the album off-balance here and there, [...] but all things considered, it is easy to understand why Trouble turned out to be the first step in a long, and very successful career.\" The release of Trouble was followed by an 18-date UK tour, beginning on 26 October 1978. The final show at the Hammersmith Odeon in London was recorded and released in Japan as Live at Hammersmith. According to Coverdale, this was done to appease Japanese promoters who allegedly refused to book Whitesnake without some kind of a live recording."]}, {"page": "John Taylor (jazz)", "response": ["| 1993, 1997 || Colin Towns Mask Orchestra w/ Skidmore, Surman, Nigel Hitchcock a.o. || Mask Orchestra (Bolt from the Blue) || The Jazz Label, Provocateur"]}, {"page": "Capital City (TV series)", "response": ["*Music: Colin Towns", "*The music for the series was composed by Colin Towns and enjoyed some success in its own right."]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Colin Towns"]}, {"page": "Full Circle", "response": ["* Full Circle, a 1997 soundtrack album by Colin Towns"]}, {"page": "Saturn Award for Best Music", "response": ["| Colin Towns"]}, {"page": "Towns (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Colin Towns (born 1948), English composer"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Royal Ballet", "response": ["| Colin Towns", "| The Dave Brubeck Quartet transcribed by Colin Towns"]}, {"page": "Ian Gillan Band", "response": ["Initially called Shand Grenade, a combination of Shangri-la and Grenade, Gillan was persuaded by the management to change the band's name to the Ian Gillan Band.
