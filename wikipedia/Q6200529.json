Anderson became aware of the side after meeting with former teammate Brian Godfrey who had recently joined Portland. The team was managed by Anderson's former Aston Villa boss Vic Crowe and, after learning of Anderson's interest, Crowe contacted the winger who agreed to join despite not knowing the team's full name or where in the country they were based. He arrived after the start of the season after Cardiff reached the final of the Welsh Cup and, despite suffering jetlag after travelling to America two days earlier, he made his debut in a 2\u20130 victory over Vancouver Whitecaps. In his following match, he scored his first goal for the club, netting the game-winning goal in overtime against Rochester Lancers. The club were sponsored by an American alcohol company named Blitz who included a 24 pack of beer each week with each player's wages. Forming an effective wing partnership with Jimmy Kelly, he helped the team achieve a 16\u20136 record, winning the Western Conference before suffering defeat to Tampa Bay Rowdies in the pre-season final."]}, {"page": "Jim Kelly (footballer born 1954)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Kelly (footballer, born 1954)"]}, {"page": "James Kelly (footballer born 1954)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Kelly (footballer, born 1954)"]}, {"page": "Soccer Bowl '75", "response": ["|F ||11 || Jimmy Kelly"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Kelly (footballer born 1954)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Kelly (footballer, born 1954)"]}]}}
