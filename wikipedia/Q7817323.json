His first year away from home proved troublesome and he describes it as \"the hardest year of my life\", regularly crying himself to sleep at night after suffering from homesickness. Each apprentice was assigned to a senior player for whom they performed basic tasks such as cleaning boots or making tea. Bellamy was paired with John Polston but found the experienced defender difficult to work with and believed Polston tried to \"humiliate\" him. Bellamy's homesickness was lessened after he became friends with another apprentice from Cardiff, Tom Ramasut, but problems with his discipline became commonplace. On one occasion, Bellamy received a final warning from staff after he broke the arm of a trialist goalkeeper during a fight on the training ground; Bellamy later wrote that he believed Norwich showed him leniency when disciplining him in fear of losing a player regarded as having a bright future. Bellamy reached a turning point in his career when his girlfriend Claire became pregnant while he was a youth player. He has credited the conception of his first child as a catalyst for his career that saw him become more determined to become a professional footballer, stating, \"I have had the career I have had because of that moment when Claire phoned me up to tell me she was pregnant\". At the end of the first year of his YTS deal, Bellamy was the only player promoted to the club's reserve side by coach Mike Phelan."]}, {"page": "Cardiff City F.C.", "response": ["| Assistant Manager || Tom Ramasut "]}, {"page": "Thais in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The Samaggi Games are an annual event for Thai students in the UK, normally attracting around 1,000 participants.
