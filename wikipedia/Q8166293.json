Born in Blackpool, Lancashire, Hurst joined the youth system for Everton, making his first team debut in the 1965\u201366 season. Originally a striker, Everton manager Harry Catterick made Hurst into a centre-half, a position in which he appeared in the 1968 FA Cup Final. He formed a defensive partnership with Brian Labone, the club captain of Everton at the time. Following the introduction of substitutes to English football in 1965 (for injury only) Hurst became Everton's first ever sub replacing Fred Pickering at Stoke City's Victoria Ground in August 1965. Everton won the league title in the 1969\u201370 season and Hurst was an ever-present during this campaign, making 42 appearances and contributing 5 goals. He also won the 1970 FA Charity Shield with Everton. Hurst was transferred to Oldham Athletic following the 1975\u201376 season.\nAfter his playing career Hurst remained in the game, working as a coach at Everton, and as a scout for Manchester City, then managed by his former teammate, Joe Royle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maghull", "response": ["Several Liverpool and Everton footballers have lived in the area, including Ian Callaghan, Duncan Ferguson, Brian Labone, Steve Staunton, Gordon West, Mick Lyons, Joe Parkinson, Roger Hunt, Tommy Wright, Roger Kenyon, John Hurst, Peter Thompson, Terry Darracott, Steve Heighway, Tony Hateley and Ian St John."]}, {"page": "List of Everton F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|John Hurst||||MF||1964\u20131976||388||34"]}, {"page": "Gordon West", "response": ["His funeral was attended by Martin Buchan, Colin Harvey, Dave Hickson, John Hurst, Cliff Marshall, Peter Reid, George Telfer, Derek Temple, Tommy Wright and former player and manager Joe Royle, along with former chairman Sir Philip Carter, who paid tribute at the service."]}]}}
