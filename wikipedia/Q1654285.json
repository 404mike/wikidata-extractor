He turned professional in 1985 and has finished in the top 100 on the European Tour Order of Merit more than a dozen times, with a best placing of tenth in 1992. His two European Tour wins came at the 1992 Canon European Masters and the 2000 Moroccan Open.\nIn 2003 he succeeded Mark James as the Chairman of The European Tour's Tournament Committee.Spence also appeared on the Sky TV scientific programme Brainiac: Science Abuse where he took part in \"Brainiac Golf\", in which a Brainiac went head to head against Spence. Every time a ball was putted it set off a fuse which ignited a caravan filled with a unique chemical compound, e.g. lead nitrate, which coloured the explosive flame.\nSpence also has a radio show named in his honour, 'The Jamie Spence Show' on Bolton FM.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 26", "response": ["*  1963   \u2013 Jamie Spence, English golfer"]}, {"page": "Bernhard Langer", "response": ["| Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Retief Goosen", "response": ["| Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Alfred Dunhill Cup", "response": ["| 1992 ||  || David Gilford, Steven Richardson, Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Open de France", "response": ["| 1997 ||  Retief Goosen || align=center|271 || align=center|\u221217 || 3 strokes ||  Jamie Spence || Le Golf National"]}, {"page": "Troph\u00e9e Lanc\u00f4me", "response": ["| 1991 ||  Frank Nobilo || align=center|267 || align=center|\u221213 || 1 stroke ||  Ian Baker-Finch Peter Fowler David Gilford Jamie Spence || "]}, {"page": "Robert Karlsson", "response": ["| Retief Goosen,  Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Dutch Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2002 ||  Tobias Dier || align=center|263 || align=center|\u221217 || 1 stroke ||  Jamie Spence || Hilversumsche"]}, {"page": "David Gilford", "response": ["| Stephen Ames,  Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Deutsche Bank Players Championship of Europe", "response": ["| 1995 ||  Bernhard Langer (2) || align=center|270 || align=center|\u221218 || 6 strokes ||  Jamie Spence || align=center|151,662"]}, {"page": "Frank Nobilo", "response": ["| Ian Baker-Finch,  Peter Fowler,  David Gilford,  Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "BMW International Open", "response": ["| 1998 ||  Russell Claydon || align=center|270 || align=center|\u221218 || 1 stroke ||  Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Omega European Masters", "response": ["| 1992 || EUR ||  Jamie Spence || align=center|271 || align=center|\u221217 || Playoff || Anders Forsbrand ||"]}, {"page": "James Spence", "response": ["* Jamie Spence (born 1963), English golfer"]}, {"page": "Russell Claydon", "response": ["| Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Anders Forsbrand", "response": ["| Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Tobias Dier", "response": ["| Jamie Spence"]}, {"page": "Austrian Open (golf)", "response": ["| 1992 || EUR ||  Peter Mitchell || align=center|271 || align=center|\u221217 || 1 stroke ||  Peter Fowler David J.
