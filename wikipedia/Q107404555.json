It is not known whether this location was chosen due to the great size of the sculpture or because it did not fulfil Warren's expectations. In 1914 the sculpture was loaned to the Lewes town council and put on public display in Lewes Town Hall. A number of puritanical local residents, led by headmistress Miss Kate Fowler Tutt, objected to the erotic nature of the sculpture. They were particularly concerned that it might encourage the ardour of the large number of soldiers who were billeted in the town at that time, and successfully campaigned to have the sculpture draped and screened from public view.  It was returned to Warren's residence at Lewes House in 1917 where it remained stored in the stable for 12 years until Warren's death in 1928. The beneficiary of Warren's will, H. Asa Thomas, put the sculpture up for sale with Gorringes, the local auctioneers, but it failed to meet its reserve price and was withdrawn from sale. A few years later it was loaned to the Tate Gallery in London. In 1955 the Tate bought the sculpture for the nation at a cost of \u00a37,500.  In 1999 between 5 June and 30 October, The Kiss returned briefly to Lewes as part of an exhibition of Rodin's works. Its regular home is now the Tate Modern - however, in September 2007, the work was transferred to the Tate Liverpool, Albert Dock where it assumed pride of place for the duration of the celebrations surrounding both that city's 8th Centenary and Liverpool's European Capital of Culture status in 2008. It was on loan to Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki in Auckland, New Zealand until 16 July 2017. It was loaned to Christchurch Mansion in Ipswich, UK for the 'Kiss and Tell' exhibition running from November 2018 to April 2019."]}, {"page": "Lewes Town Hall", "response": ["The sculpture, The Kiss, by Auguste Rodin, was placed on display in the assembly room of the town hall during much of the First World War but was removed in 1917, supposedly after a local headmistress, Kate Fowler Tutt, objected to its erotic nature. Later investigation has found no documentary evidence for this narrative.", "In 1999 the Tate's copy of The Kiss was returned on loan to Lewes Town Hall. During the ensuing debate a descendant of the headmistress, Kate Fowler Tutt, noted that she only appears prudish today. In fact she was formidable and the first woman in Lewes to serve on the council."]}]}}
