He served as King Alfred Professor of English Literature at Liverpool University from 1951 to 1974.\nMuir edited volumes 19 through 33 of the Shakespeare Survey, and served as chairman of the International Shakespeare Association. He authored and edited a wide range of scholarly articles and books \u2013 primarily on Shakespeare and other Elizabethans, but also on various other subjects, including John Keats, Jean Racine, and Pedro Calderon de la Barca. He edited modern texts of many classic plays of the English Renaissance, including Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, Troilus and Cressida, and Richard II. He also edited the collected poems of Sir Thomas Wyatt.\nMuir is vulnerable to confusion with other authors with very similar names: John Kenneth Muir, Kenneth B. Muir, Kenneth R. Muir, and Kenneth W. Muir.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Macbeth", "response": ["Like Richard III, but without that character's perversely appealing exuberance, Macbeth wades through blood until his inevitable fall. As Kenneth Muir writes, \"Macbeth has not a predisposition to murder; he has merely an inordinate ambition that makes murder itself seem to be a lesser evil than failure to achieve the crown.\" Some critics, such as E. E. Stoll, explain this characterisation as a holdover from Senecan or medieval tradition. Shakespeare's audience, in this view, expected villains to be wholly bad, and Senecan style, far from prohibiting a villainous protagonist, all but demanded it.", "All references to Macbeth, unless otherwise specified, are taken from the Arden Shakespeare, second series edition edited by Kenneth Muir. Under their referencing system, III.I.55 means act 3, scene 1, line 55. All references to other Shakespeare plays are to The Oxford Shakespeare Complete Works of Shakespeare edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor."]}, {"page": "King John (play)", "response": ["King John is closely related to an anonymous history play, The Troublesome Reign of King John (c. 1589), the \"masterly construction\" the infelicitous expression of which led Peter Alexander to argue that Shakespeare's was the earlier play. E. A. J. Honigmann elaborated these arguments, both in his preface to the second Arden edition of King John, and in his 1982 monograph on Shakespeare's influence on his contemporaries. The majority view, however, first advanced in a rebuttal of Honigmann's views by Kenneth Muir, holds that the Troublesome Reign antedates King John by a period of several years; and that the skilful plotting of the Troublesome Reign is neither unparalleled in the period, nor proof of Shakespeare's involvement."]}, {"page": "Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca", "response": ["Although not well known to the current English-speaking world, Calder\u00f3n's plays were first adapted into English during the 17th century. For instance, Samuel Pepys recorded attending to some plays during 1667 which were free translations of some of Calder\u00f3n's. Percy Bysshe Shelley translated a substantial portion of El M\u00e1gico prodigioso. Some of Calder\u00f3n's works have been translated into English, notably by Denis Florence MacCarthy, Edward FitzGerald, Roy Campbell, Edwin Honig, Kenneth Muir & Ann L. Mackenzie, Adrian Mitchell, and Gwynne Edwards."]}, {"page": "John Davies of Hereford", "response": ["In a 2007 monograph, Shakespeare, \"A Lover's Complaint,\" and John Davies of Hereford, Brian Vickers attributes to Davies the poem \"A Lover's Complaint\", which was published by Thomas Thorpe with Shakespeare's Sonnets in 1609. This attribution goes against scholarly consensus, and in particular studies by Kenneth Muir, Eliot Slater and MacDonald P. Jackson, but is based on both a detailed demonstration of the non-Shakespearean nature of the poem and a list of numerous verbal parallels\u2014such as 'What brest so cold that is not warmed heare' and 'What heart's so cold that is not set on fire'\u2014between the Complaint and the known works of Davies. On Vickers's attribution it was omitted from the 2007 RSC Shakespeare Complete Works, a decision Jackson called a mistake in his RES review of Vickers's book, arguing, among other reservations, that \"Evidence that, in poems undoubtedly his, Davies exhibits an intimacy with Shakespeare's works equal to that of the author of 'A Lover's Complaint' is very meagre.\""]}, {"page": "Chronology of Shakespeare's plays", "response": [":Evidence: the date of The Tempest can be securely fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, it must have been completed before November, and it is unlikely that the Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The terminus post quem of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for Virginia, carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the Sea Venture, was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda. All hands were thought lost, but on 23 May 1610 her passengers arrived safely in Virginia, having found shelter on Bermuda, where they repaired the pinnaces and completed their journey. The play is particularly indebted to William Strachey's A True Reportory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, written in Virginia, and dated 15 July. The MS was carried back to England by Gates himself, who arrived in London in early September. Although True Reportory was not published until 1625, it is known to have been read widely in MS form. Two pamphlets published later in 1610 were also used as sources; Sylvester Jourdain's A Discovery of the Bermudas, the dedication of which is dated 13 October 1610, and the Virginia Company's own A True Declaration of the Estate of the Colonie in Virginia, which was entered into the Stationers Register on 8 November. It is worth noting that although most scholars accept these texts as sources and evidence of dating, not all do so. Kenneth Muir is a notable example of a scholar who questions the argument that Shakespeare used Strachey. Stylistically, a rare vocabulary test, a colloquialism-in-verse test and Ants Oras' pause test all place the play after Coriolanus, Winter's Tale and Cymbeline."]}, {"page": "George Chapman", "response": ["Chapman wrote one of the most successful masques of the Jacobean era, The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn, performed on 15 February 1613.

The four main contenders, presented as such by Kenneth Muir in Shakespeare's Sonnets, are: \"Apart from some candidates too absurd to merit discussion- William Himself, Willie Hughes- there are four main contenders: William Harvey, William Hatcliffe, William Hervert and Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton\". Out of these four, Henry Wriothesley is one of the favorites, as Shakespeare had dedicated two of his narrative poems to the Earl. Muir had another idea that, \"It is, of course possible that the Sonnets were inspired by Shakespeare's relationship with more than one patron\u00a0... but, if so, this would undercut the poet's vows of eternal fidelity. It is possible, too, that W.H. has not yet been identified; and it is possible that there is such a large admixture of fiction in the sonnet story that it is a waste of time to treat them as contributions to the biography of any of the four candidates.\""]}, {"page": "King Alfred Chair of English Literature", "response": ["*1951\u20131974: Kenneth Muir FBA"]}, {"page": "1949 in poetry", "response": ["* James Kirkup, editor, Leeds University Poetry, including work by Kirkup, Wilfred Rowland Childe, Derrick Metcalfe, and Kenneth Muir (Hull: Lotus Press)\"James Kirkup\" , Leeds University Library website, retrieved November 30, 2008"]}, {"page": "Sonnet 86", "response": ["The sonnet begins with the speaker asking whether it was the \"great verse\" of his rival poet that had prevented the speaker from expressing his own \"ripe thoughts.\" According to Duncan-Jones, \"As in the final line of the preceding sonnet, the speaker claims to be unable to voice his thoughts of love: they are ready for utterance (ripe), but remain buried (in-hearsed) in his brain because [the speaker's question proposes] he is intimidated by his rival.\" Harold Bloom considers this intimidation is not caused by the artistic skill of his rival. In the opening lines of the sonnet, \"[Shakespeare] charmingly suggests an inhibition through jealousy, not of superior poetic powers, but of encountering the Fair Young Man's portrait in a rival's verses.\" Kenneth Muir writes: \"Whether \u2018the proud full sail of his great verse\u2019 is sincere admiration [by the speaker of the sonnet] or a hint that [the rival's verse] is bombastic is still debated.\""]}]}}
