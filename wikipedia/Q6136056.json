Born in Dundee, his family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne and he lived there or Gateshead for the remainder of his short life. He is famous as the composer of many fine common-time hornpipes for fiddle, including The High Level Bridge, The Beeswing, The Hawk and The Omnibus. He was sufficiently well known that many other tunes by others, such as Blaydon Flats, were also mistakenly attributed to him.\nHe was of much more than local importance. The Newcastle style of hornpipe, of which he was the best-known exponent, became the model for many later-19th-century examples. Many of his tunes, particularly The High Level Bridge and The Beeswing became well-known wherever hornpipes were played \u2013  both of these were published in Ryan's Mammoth Collection, which was first published in Boston in 1884.\nA book, The Lads like Beer was compiled by Graham Dixon and first published in the 1990s by Wallace Music. A new revised edition was published in 2013 (Mitchell Music ISBN 978-0-9926696-0-7) with additional information and background to Hill's known compositions and those attributed to or known to be played by him. The Fiddle Music of James Hill (ISBN 0-902510-27-4), a collection of Hill's compositions and other tunes, transposed into keys suitable for Northumbrian smallpipes, has been published by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society. Some of the early manuscript sources for his music may be viewed in facsimile on the FARNE (Folk Archive Resource North East) archive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*James Hill"]}, {"page": "1853 in music", "response": ["*date unknown \u2013 James Hill, folk musician (b. c. 1811)"]}, {"page": "1811 in music", "response": ["*probable \u2013 James Hill, folk musician (d. 1853)"]}, {"page": "Earl Grey", "response": ["The Gateshead fiddler James Hill (b 1811 d 1856) composed the tune \"Earl Gray\" in the Scottish Strathspey style, possibly to commemorate the opening of Grey's Monument in 1838.

The High Level is one. Many dance tunes in idioms similar to fiddle tunes have been composed by pipers specifically for their own instrument \u2013 The Barrington Hornpipe, by Thomas Todd, written in the late 19th century, is typical. Borrowing from other traditions and instruments has continued \u2013 in the early-to-mid 20th century, Billy Pigg,Billy Pigg, The Border Minstrel, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2nd edition, 2 vols., C. Ross and J. Say, , . and Jack Armstrong (The Duke of Northumberland's Piper) for instance, adapted many tunes from the Scottish and Irish pipe and fiddle repertoires to smallpipes, as well as composing tunes in various styles for the instrument."]}, {"page": "Hornpipe", "response": ["* The most common use of the term nowadays refers to a class of tunes in  time.  The dance is done in hard shoes.  Perhaps the best known example is the \"Sailors' Hornpipe\". There are two basic types of common-time hornpipe, ones like the \"Sailors' Hornpipe\", moving in even notes, sometimes notated in , moving a little slower than a reel, and ones like \"The Harvest Home\", moving in dotted notes. Some 19th-century examples mix the dotted and even styles. These led the form to being called the 'Newcastle Style'  The form dates back to the mid-18th century or earlier but became much more popular in the early 19th century. Many hornpipes were written in this period, often with well-known composers. In Ireland, examples include \"The Groves Hornpipe\" and \"The Boys of Bluehill\". In England, a noted composer of hornpipes on Tyneside was the influential fiddler-publican James Hill  (c.1811-1853). The form also became very popular in the United States \u2013 \"President Garfield's Hornpipe\" being an example."]}, {"page": "Music of Northumbria", "response": ["In the nineteenth century the most notable feature of the region's music was the popularity of the hornpipe in 4/4 time, and in particular the very influential playing of the publican, fiddler and composer James Hill. His compositions include 'The High Level Bridge', 'The Great Exhibition', 'The Beeswing', 'The Hawk' and many others. Many other fine tunes have been attributed to him, but these include some he cannot possibly have written. Another local composer, in the later 19th century, was the fiddler and dancing master Robert Whinham, some 60 of whose compositions survive, notably the hornpipe 'Remember Me', and 'Whinham's Reel'."]}, {"page": "Northumbrian Pipers' Society", "response": ["The Northumbrian Pipers' Society was founded in 1928 in Newcastle upon Tyne, under the patronage of the Duke of Northumberland. The first President was G. V. B. Charlton, who had been active in encouraging the playing of the smallpipes, and particularly the revival of the half-long pipes. Its policy aim was to encourage and stimulate 'the younger generation of pipers and beginners in pipe playing'. Billy Pigg, an influential piper, was a vice-president from 1930, while Tom Clough, known as the 'Prince of Pipers', accepted a vice-presidency in 1933. At first they met in each other's homes to exchange tunes and to organise the occasional dance. In 1937 they acquired a permanent home in the Morden Tower in Newcastle. The Society's regular meetings and annual competitions are currently held the Chantry Bagpipe Museum, in Morpeth. It also holds an annual concert in Morpeth. It publishes a quarterly newsletter and an annual magazine, as well as many important collections of pipe music, including, in 2000 The Clough Family of Newsham,The Clough Family of Newsham, , edited by Chris Ormston and Julia Say a detailed study of the music of Tom Clough and his family, and, in 1997, The Border Minstrel,Billy Pigg, The Border Minstrel, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2nd edition, 2 vols., C. Ross and J. Say, , . which included all of Billy Pigg's known compositions, and some other tunes from his repertoire. Other important recent tunebooks include a new edition of John Peacock's early tunebook,Peacock's Tunes, 2nd ed., Northumbrian Pipers' Society (1999),  and a book of James Hill's hornpipes and other tunes, adapted for the smallpipes,The Fiddle Music of James Hill, () and a tunebook and tutor for the Border pipes. They also published an important book on pipemaking, by William Alfred Cocks and Jim F.
