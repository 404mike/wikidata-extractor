However, despite continued success in the FA Cup, form slipped. Between 17 December 2011, and 13 March 2012, Crawley won just two league games out of a possible 14. Many argued the sales of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett for \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31,100,000 respectively, as well as failing to reach a deal over Andy Drury contributed to their dip in form. Three Crawley players were involved in a post-match brawl against Bradford City, including former club captain Pablo Mills (suspended for six matches) and fellow defender Claude Davis (suspended for four matches). Five players from both clubs were suspended in total equalling the record for the most dismissals in an English game. Consequently, Crawley were fined \u00a318,000. Following an FA inquiry into the events that took place, Kyle McFadzean was handed a four-game suspension after being found guilty of violent conduct. All three players have since released apology statements, and were all fined two weeks' wages. Despite apologising, Mills was stripped of his captaincy for behaviour not befitting the role of a club captain. He was released by the club at the conclusion of the 2011/12 season."]}, {"page": "Nathan Elder", "response": ["On 31 January 2008, Elder joined Brentford for \u00a335,000. He scored an own goal on his debut for Brentford against Mansfield Town after just 15 minutes (though the goal was later credited to Mansfield player Michael Boulding), but scored the winner as Brentford eventually won 3\u20132. Elder won a 2008\u201309 League Two championship medal with the Bees, but his season was ended early after suffering a double fracture of the cheekbone, a fractured eye socket, severe trauma to the eyeball and extensive bleeding in and around the eye in a \"horror clash\" with Rotherham United's Pablo Mills in a match on 7 March 2009. In the days following the incident, Elder had no sight in his left eye and Brentford manager Andy Scott called for justice to be done. On 12 March, it was reported that the FA would be unable to take disciplinary action against Mills. Elder recovered sufficiently to be included in the squad for the final match of the season against Luton Town, but he remained an unused substitute and would not play again for the club. He revealed in April 2009 that the vision in his left eye would never be 100% again."]}, {"page": "David Flitcroft", "response": ["Flitcroft was appointed as manager of Bury on 9 December 2013, who were then 20th in League Two. He told the press that his team were too inexperienced and he wanted to bring in \"that middle range \u2013 that bracket of 25 to 30-year-olds that have been around the game and know the game, but are still dynamic\". However he also acknowledged that the squad was too big and that players would have to leave. In the January transfer window he released five players \u2013 Gareth Roberts, Shaun Harrad, Marlon Jackson, Euan Holden and Jessy Reindorf, and renovated the defence by signing Pablo Mills, Robbie McIntyre, James Burke, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Veseli and Jim McNulty. He was named as League Two Manager of the Month for February after overseeing an unbeaten month that gained the club 11 points, including a 4\u20131 win at Mansfield Town.

(1967\u2013present)", "response": ["Derby had budgeted for a fourth bottom finish (i.e. survival) in the Premier League and when this was not achieved the club was once again plunged into financial crisis. In an attempt to bounce back to the top flight at the first time of asking the club rejected offers for their better players over the summer -such as Malcolm Christie, Mart Poom, Danny Higginbotham and Chris Riggott \u2013 and an opening day 3\u20130 win over Reading seemed to have justified the decision. However, this proved a false dawn and a 1\u20130 defeat away to Gillingham in the next game signalled what was to come as the club won just 10 of its opening 29 fixtures and suffered embarrassing cup exits to lower league teams Brentford (FA Cup) and Oldham Athletic (League Cup). Players weren't paid on time (resulting in Danny Higginbotham going on strike), with high earning players such as Georgi Kinkladze and Fabrizio Ravanelli underperforming, and the club was trading insolvent. Christie, Riggott, Higginbotham and Poom were eventually sold in the January 2002 Transfer window, netting considerably less than they would have if sold the previous summer, and joined players like Horacio Carbonari, Darryl Powell and Deon Burton in exiting the club (Burton leaving as the club's most capped ever player, with 42 appearances for Jamaica). With the club low on registered professionals, home grown youngsters were given a chance at first team level, with Lee Holmes (who became the youngest player in the club's history when he took the field against Grimsby aged 15 years and 268 days), Lee Grant, Pablo Mills, Izale McLeod and Lee Camp all handed debuts throughout the course of the season. Although the club won its first game following the exodus 3\u20130 against Rotherham United they then embarked on 9 match winless streak which seriously threatened relegation. The eight match of this run was a 0\u20133 defeat by Nottingham Forest and Gregory was suspended the next day, the club alleging serious misconduct. Nothing specific was ever offered ad the next board had to pay Gregory a seven figure settlement. Gregory's replacement (initially on a short-term contract until the end of the season but then appointed full-time) was former Ipswich Town boss George Burley. His remit was simple: avoid relegation. A 2\u20131 win over Norwich City in Burley's first match got his reign off to the perfect start, and although only 6 points were taken from the next 6 games, it was enough to finish 18th in the league with 52 points, 6 clear of relegated Sheffield Wednesday in 22nd.", "With no money to spend, Burley played the markets and made two key free signings in I\u00f1igo Idiakez and Grzegorz Rasiak.

Behind the scenes circumstances were deteriorating, and Burley left his position, citing interference from football agent turned Director of Football Murdo Mackay, and the sale of Huddlestone, to Tottenham Hotspur, against his wishes. Financial circumstances were worsening as the debt spiralled to \u00a330m plus, despite Burley building success on the pitch without using any transfer funds.

Rotherham then had chances to score with Pablo Mills missing a header before three separate efforts from Ryan Taylor all failed to produce a goal.  In the 30th minute, Romain Vincelot's bicycle kick was saved by Warrington before Sharps received the first yellow card of the match for unsporting behaviour:  Warrington kept the resulting free kick from Green out.  Three minutes later, Le Fondre was also booked, also for unsporting behaviour.  In the 38th minute, a low cross from Damien McCrory found Benson in space who scored with a curling shot into the bottom corner of the Rotherham goal.
