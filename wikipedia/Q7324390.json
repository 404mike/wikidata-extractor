He played in both the Football League and the Premier League, representing Sheffield Wednesday, Blackburn Rovers, Maidstone United and Stockport County. He began his career with Ilkeston Town and also played non-league football for several other clubs.\nBrown played youth football with local club Nottingham Forest and was an associated schoolboy at the club. However he was not offered professional terms and dropped out of league football to play for Ilkeston, where his performances caught the attention of Sheffield Wednesday, with whom he turned professional. However Brown did not make a first team appearance and returned to the non-league scene, initially with Ilkeston before playing for Grantham Town, Boston United and Kettering Town. It was from the latter that he returned to the Football League, signing for Blackburn Rovers in 1990. Due to his lack of league experience he was loaned out to Maidstone United in 1991 and made his Football League debut on 23 February at Hereford United.Returning to Blackburn, Brown, who although right-footed operated on either flank in a full back role, made his Rovers debut in a home game against Port Vale on 14 September 1991 but was rarely used by the club thereafter. He returned to the first team for a run of games following the appointment of Kenny Dalglish as manager although his path into the first team was usually blocked by Chris Price and David May. He remained at the club until 1995, when he moved on a free transfer to Stockport County. Brown retired from football aged 27 after being dogged by injuries throughout his career.As of 2017 Brown was reported as working for Salford Community Leisure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Brown", "response": ["Richard Brown or Browne may refer to:", "* Richard Brown (cricketer) (1811\u2013?), English cricketer and clergyman", "* Richard Brown (footballer) (born 1967), retired English footballer", "* Richard Brown (rugby union) (born 1984), Australian rugby union footballer", "* Richard Brown (linebacker) (born 1965), former American football linebacker", "* Richard Brown (American football center) (1907\u20131990), played for Portsmouth Spartans", "* Richard Browne (hurler) (born 1962), retired Irish sportsman", "* Richard Browne (athletics) (born 1991), USA sprint runner and high jumper", "* Richard Browne (footballer) (born 1946), Australian rules footballer for Hawthorn", "* Richard Brown (Canadian politician) (born 1956)", "* Sir Richard Browne, 1st Baronet, of Deptford (c. 1605\u20131682/83), English ambassador to the court of France", "* Sir Richard Browne, 1st Baronet, of London (c. 1610\u20131669), Major-General in the English Parliamentary army; Lord Mayor of London", "* Richard Browne (died 1604) (c. 1538\u20131604), MP for Lichfield, Newton (Isle of Wight), Cirencester and Harwich", "* Richard Browne (died 1614?), MP for Steyning, Arundel, Lewes, Gatton and Midhurst", "* Richard Brown (Ohio politician), member of the Ohio House of Representatives", "* Richard Brown (lawyer) (1932\u20132019), American attorney and politician from the state of New York", "*Richard Brown (Missouri politician), member of the Missouri House of Representatives", "* Richard Brown (captain) (1753\u20131833), shipmaster and friend of Robert Burns", "* Richard Brown (journalist), Canadian television journalist", "* Richard Brown (professor) (c. 1712\u2013?), academic at the University of Oxford", "* Richard Brown (transport executive) (born 1953), British chief transport executive & chairman of Eurostar", "* Richard Browne (painter) (1776\u20131824), early Australian convict artist and illustrator", "* Sir Richard Browne, 2nd Baronet (before 1634\u20131684), barrister", "* Richard Brown (TV and Film Producer)", "* Richard Brown, rocket developer of Corpulent Stump", "* Richard Brown, openSUSE Chairman", "* Richard Brown, British musician, original drummer for the new wave-post-punk band Modern English"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|15||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Richard Brown", "|3 March 1995 || Richard Brown|| Stockport County||Free"]}]}}
