Born in Darwen, Lancashire, he began his career with his hometown club, Darwen F.C., before moving to Manchester United in May 1921 in a \u00a3750 joint transfer that also brought George Haslam to Old Trafford. He made his debut in January 1922 in a 3\u20130 away defeat to Sheffield United, playing alongside Charlie Radford in the absence of Jack Silcock. Howarth played three more games that season, this time with Silcock in place of Radford, including a 3\u20132 win in the return fixture against Sheffield United. Manchester United were relegated at the end of the season, but although they used 29 players in the Second Division in 1922\u201323, Howarth never played for the club again. He was transfer-listed at the end of the season, but was reported to still be without a club by the start of the 1927\u201328 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Haslam (footballer)", "response": ["George Haslam (born 23 March 1898 \u2013 13 August 1980) was an English footballer who played as a centre-half. Born in Turton, Lancashire, he began his career with Darwen before joining Manchester United in May 1921, signed along with John Howarth for a combined fee of \u00a3750. He made his debut nine months later in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Birmingham City on 25 February 1922. In just over six seasons with Manchester United, Haslam made just 27 appearances for the first team, although he was a regular for the reserves, whom he captained to second place in The Central League in 1926\u201327. In April 1927, he shared a benefit match against Sunderland with club veterans Lal Hilditch and Jack Silcock. Haslam was transferred to Portsmouth for a fee of \u00a32,500 in November 1927, but left at the end of the season, returning to Lancashire to play for Cheshire County League side Ashton National. He became something of a journeyman in his later career, playing no more than a season for each of Whitchurch, Lancaster Town, Chorley, Burscough Rangers and Northwich Victoria."]}, {"page": "John Howarth", "response": ["John Howarth may refer to:", "* John Howarth (politician) (born 1958), British Labour Party politician and MEP", "* John Howarth (cricketer) (born 1945), English county cricketer", "* John Howarth (footballer) (1899\u2013?), English footballer"]}]}}
