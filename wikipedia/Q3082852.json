According to the botanical criteria of Frank WhiteWickens, Gerald E. (1998) Ecophysiology of Economic Plants in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands. Springer, Berlin.  and geographer Robert Capot-Rey, the northern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the northern limit of date palm cultivation and the southern limit of the range of esparto, a grass typical of the Mediterranean climate portion of the Maghreb and Iberia. The northern limit also corresponds to the  isohyet of annual precipitation."]}, {"page": "Frank White", "response": ["Frank White may refer to:", "* Frank White (North Dakota politician) (1856\u20131940), Republican politician, eighth Governor of North Dakota, Treasurer of the United States", "* Frank White (British politician) (born 1939), British Labour Member of Parliament for Bury and Radcliffe, 1974\u20131983", "* Frank White (Florida politician) (born 1978), member of the Florida House of Representatives", "* Frank White (footballer) (1911\u20131985), English footballer", "* Frank White (hurler) (1913\u20131984), Irish hurler", "* Frank White (baseball) (born 1950), American baseball player", "* Frank White (botanist) (1927\u20131994), expert on African flora and curator of the Oxford University herbarium", "* Frank White (bishop) (born 1949), Church of England priest who served as Bishop of Brixworth and Assistant Bishop of Newcastle", "* Frank White, an alias of The Notorious B.I.G.

The mountains intercept humid southwesterly winds from the Indian Ocean, which form clouds and rain and create a cooler, wetter climate than the surrounding lowlands. These mountains are home to lowland evergreen forests with a similar flora to the coastal lowland forests, and higher-elevation montane forests, woodlands, grasslands, and heathlands which are home to many Afromontane species.\"Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane Coastal Forest Mosaic\".
