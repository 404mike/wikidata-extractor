On 12 September 2018, Bolton reached an agreement with their main creditor BluMarble Capital Ltd over an unpaid loan, avoiding administration and a points deduction from the EFL. Bolton were served a winding-up order on 27 September 2018 after failing to make a payment to HM Revenue and Customs. This was the fourth such petition the club had faced in the previous 14 months. After the collapse of the permanent signing of on-loan striker Christian Doidge, Forest Green Rovers commenced legal action over lost earnings. In February 2019, Bolton were again issued a winding-up petition by HMRC which was subsequently adjourned until the end of the season as their search for a new owner continued. The match against Brentford on 26 April was called off by the English Football League 16 hours before kick off after Bolton's players, supported by the Professional Footballers' Association, refused to play until they had received their unpaid wages;  the EFL awarded the win to Brentford. The Bolton Whites Hotel, owned by Ken Anderson, was also issued with a winding-up petition in March 2019 (it closed on 1 May and went into administration on 14 May). The team was relegated to League One in April after a 23rd-place finish."]}, {"page": "Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.", "response": ["|Christian Doidge 8"]}, {"page": "Croesyceiliog A.F.C.", "response": ["During the club's history, four players have gone on to play professionally in the English Football League: Terry Cooper, Andy Dibble, Glyn Garner and Christian Doidge.", "*  Christian Doidge"]}, {"page": "List of people from Newport", "response": ["* Christian Doidge"]}, {"page": "Doidge", "response": ["* Christian Doidge, Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Professional Football League monthly award winners", "response": ["| Christian Doidge(Hibernian)"]}, {"page": "List of Forest Green Rovers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"#D0F0C0\"| Christian Doidge", "| Christian Doidge", "| Christian Doidge"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Christian Doidge"]}]}}
