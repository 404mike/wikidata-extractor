In this series, the two lampooned themselves as incapable of getting any work done: Saunders later characterised it as \"a fairly accurate rendition of our writing process\", but asserted that, while they appeared to others to be procrastinating, they were actually generating writing ideas. The series also starred Liza Tarbuck as a heavily fictionalised version of herself, forced to be the fictional show's producer despite her actual career goal of creating and producing game shows, and Lorna Brown as the production assistant, Abba. Maggie Steed appeared in two episodes as the duo's agent, Mo, based on their real agent, Maureen Vincent, while Eileen Essell and Brenda Cowling appeared briefly in several episodes as Abba's imagination of French and Saunders, respectively, as old women.
