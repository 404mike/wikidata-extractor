She became the first female editor-in-chief at The Guardian on 1 June 2015 succeeding Alan Rusbridger. Viner previously headed The Guardian's web operations in Australia and the United States, before being selected for the editor-in-chief's position.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Naomi Wolf", "response": ["In an interview with Melinda Henneberger in The New York Times, Wolf said she had been appointed in January 1999 and denied having advised Gore on his wardrobe. Wolf said she had mentioned the term \"alpha male\" only once in passing and that \"[it] was just a truism, something the pundits had been saying for months, that the vice president is in a supportive role and the President is in an initiatory role ... I used those terms as shorthand in talking about the difference in their job descriptions\". Wolf told Katharine Viner of The Guardian in 2001: \"I believe his agenda for women was a really historic agenda. I was honoured to bring the concerns of women to Gore's table, I'm sorry that he didn't win and the controversy was worth it for me.\" She told Viner the men in Gore's campaign, at the equivalent level, were paid more than she was.", "\"I feel absolutely staggered by what I discovered after giving birth,\" Wolf said at the time Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood (2001) was published  \"Birth today is like agribusiness. It's like a chicken plant: they go in, they go out.\" she told Katharine Viner. \"Pregnancy, birth and motherhood\" has \"made me a more radical feminist than I have ever been.\" The book is mostly told through the prism of Wolf's experience of her first pregnancy. She describes the \"vacuous impassivity\" of the ultrasound technician who gives her the first glimpse of her new baby. Wolf laments her C-section and examines why the procedure is commonplace in the United States, advocating a return to midwifery. The second half of the book is anecdotal, focusing on inequalities between parents to child care. In the section describing being on the operating table having a caesarian, Wolf compares herself to Jesus at his Crucifixion. She outlines a \"mothers' manifesto\" in the book including flexi-time for both parents, neighborhood toy banks and a radical mothers' movement."]}, {"page": "Alan Rickman", "response": ["With Katharine Viner, Rickman compiled the play My Name Is Rachel Corrie and directed the premiere production at the Royal Court Theatre in London, which opened in April 2005. He won the Theatre Goers' Choice Awards for Best Director. Rickman befriended the Corrie family and earned their trust, and the show was warmly received. But the next year, its original New York production was \"postponed\" over the possibility of boycotts and protests from those who saw it as \"anti-Israeli agit-prop\". Rickman denounced \"censorship born out of fear\". Tony Kushner, Harold Pinter and Vanessa Redgrave, among others, criticised the decision to indefinitely delay the show. The one-woman play was put on later that year at another theatre to mixed reviews, and has since been staged at venues around the world. Despite the adverse reaction from pro-Israel groups, overall, the film was very popular, especially in London. \"I never imagined that the play would create such acute controversy,\" Rickman said. He added, \"Many Jews supported it. The New York producer was Jewish and we held a discussion after every performance. Both Israelis and Palestinians participated in the discussions and there was no shouting in the theater. People simply listened to each other.\"", "In early 2005, My Name is Rachel Corrie, a play composed from Corrie's journals and emails from Gaza and compiled by Rickman and journalist Katharine Viner, in a production directed by Rickman, was presented in London and later revived in October 2005.
