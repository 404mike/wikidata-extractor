In 1991, a steam locomotive which had previously hauled coal at Ashington Colliery where Milburn had worked was renamed Jackie Milburn in his honour. After a fundraising initiative launched in 2006, by Jack Milburn Jr to restore the locomotive, it was displayed in Milburn's hometown again in 2011. In 2006, Milburn was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his contribution to English football. In 2008, Excelsior Academy School in Newcastle's West End was assigned the official name 'Milburn School of Sport and Health-related Studies'. In 2009, Goal.com listed Milburn 43rd in their list of the 'top English players of all time'. A feature in the Belfast Telegraph to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Linfield, listed Milburn as the second greatest player to have ever represented the club.
