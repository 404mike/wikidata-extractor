He believed healing was the main focus of the ministry of Jesus Christ and believed in a dual atonement; \"salvation for the soul and healing for the body\". He believed and taught that miracles ascribed to Christ in the New Testament were also possible in modern times. Branham believed all sickness was a result of demonic activity and could be overcome by the faith of the person desiring healing. Branham argued that God was required to heal when faith was present. This led him to conclude that individuals who failed to be healed lacked adequate faith. Branham's teaching on divine healing were within the mainstream of Pentecostal theology and echoed the doctrines taught by Smith Wigglesworth, Bosworth, and other prominent Pentecostal ministers of the prior generation."]}, {"page": "List of Christian preachers", "response": ["* Smith Wigglesworth (1859\u20131947) Pentecostalism"]}, {"page": "Influencers Church", "response": ["The church was founded in 1907 by British evangelist Smith Wigglesworth., later becoming known as Adelaide Assembly of God, when down-town property on Franklin Street, Adelaide, was purchased in 1944.Accessed 2014-04-15 In 1951 Tom Evans, a British missionary from India, became senior pastor.My Father \u2013 Thomas Lever Evans 1901 \u2013 1996 Accessed 2014-04-16 Pastors John and Beryl Jobe commenced as senior pastors in 1959.

His manner was bookish, but he was such a skilled teacher that he kept our attention long enough to teach us biblical theology in terms we could understand. We eventually heard him teach on every passage in the Bible, and he backed up his positions, putting them in the context of church history and current events.

Evangelist Francisco Olaz\u00e1bal was converted to Pentecostalism by the Montgomerys in 1916. This experience deeply impacted her life and spirituality and the theme of Spirit baptism became integrated into her magazine and her teaching. Because of her great reputation, she was used as a bridge between Evangelicals and Pentecostals. To the Evangelicals, she had a voice to introduce Spirit baptism to them without all the fanaticism and to the Pentecostals, she remained balanced and didn\u2019t overemphasize the practice of speaking in tongues. By 1914, she was part of what would later be called the Assemblies of God, starting as a charter member before becoming an assemblies minister in 1917. Throughout her life, Carrie became personal friends with Charles Cullis, A.B. Simpson, William Booth, Minnie Abrams, Pandita Ramabai, Elizabeth Baxter, Maria Woodworth-Etter, and William J. Seymour. She was connected to Smith Wigglesworth, Aimee Semple McPherson, John G. Lake, Finis E. Yoakum, George Peck, and many other prominent Christian leaders in her time. In 1922, she published Heart Melody and her autobiography in 1936.
