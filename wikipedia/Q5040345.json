Scott had been a familiar face on the Liverpool music circuit since the early 1980s; his first band, Hello Sunset, had been supported by an early line-up of The La's. Scott and Murphy had previously performed together in The Substitutes before renaming the band Space. Although most of the band were in their mid-20s, Murphy was only 17, and turned up to the band's first rehearsal session dressed in his school uniform. Space recorded their debut single, \"If It's Real\", to fulfill a publishing deal they had signed with BMG. It was released on 5 July 1993 as a 12\" single through Hug Records, set up by the band's long-time manager and supporter Mark Cowley, with artwork designed by Carl Hunter of The Farm. However, the trio were unhappy with the results, feeling it sounded 'generic' and too similar to other Liverpool bands at the time, and set out to find a new direction."]}, {"page": "The Farm (British band)", "response": ["In 2018, Carl Hunter directed the feature film Sometimes Always Never, which was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce and starred Bill Nighy, Sam Riley, Alice Lowe, Jenny Agutter and Tim McInnerny.

The film was previously known under the title The Allotment.", "The original idea for the film came from Carl Hunter's involvement with the Merseyside community group \"Art in Action\". With the project he had worked with a number of refugees who had taken up residence in Liverpool. The refugees were each given an allotment as part of a Liverpool City Council initiative. This led Hunter to produce a series of documentaries about the lives of the refugees entitled Putting Down Roots, they were broadcast as part of the \"3-minute wonder\" slot on Channel 4. Frank Cottrell Boyce saw some potential in the concept and asked Hunter if he wished to work with him to turn the real-life story into a film.
