In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamics, initiating the Kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases. In 1761, Joseph Black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting. In 1772, Black's student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen, which he called phlogisticated air, and together they developed the phlogiston theory.Biographical note at \"Lectures and Papers of Professor Daniel Rutherford (1749\u20131819), and Diary of Mrs Harriet Rutherford\" . In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion.\"Sur la combustion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" (\"On Combustion in general\", 1777) and \"Consid\u00e9rations G\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la Nature des Acides\" (\"General Considerations on the Nature of Acids\", 1778).

Best, Lavoisier's 'Reflections on Phlogiston' II: On the Nature of Heat, Foundations of Chemistry, 2015, 17. In this early work, Lavoisier calls it \"igneous fluid\".The 1880 edition of A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar, a 19th-century educational science book, explained heat transfer in terms of the flow of caloric. In 1804, Sir John Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of black-body radiation. In 1808, John Dalton defended caloric theory in A New System of Chemistry and described how it combines with matter, especially gases; he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight. In 1824, Sadi Carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory; he developed the notion of a reversible process and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics."]}, {"page": "Nitrogen", "response": ["Nitrogen is the chemical element with the symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name nitrog\u00e8ne was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the  \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used instead in many languages, such as French, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Portuguese and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.", "The discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it noxious air.Rutherford, Daniel (1772) \"Dissertatio Inauguralis de aere fixo, aut mephitico \" (Inaugural dissertation on the air [called] fixed or mephitic), M.D. dissertation, University of Edinburgh, Scotland. English translation:  Though he did not recognise it as an entirely different chemical substance, he clearly distinguished it from Joseph Black's \"fixed air\", or carbon dioxide.Aaron J. Ihde, The Development of Modern Chemistry, New York 1964. The fact that there was a component of air that does not support combustion was clear to Rutherford, although he was not aware that it was an element. Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by Carl Wilhelm Scheele,Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Chemische Abhandlung von der Luft und dem Feuer [Chemical treatise on air and fire] (Upsala, Sweden: Magnus Swederus, 1777; and Leipzig, (Germany): Siegfried Lebrecht Crusius, 1777).

He concluded (p. 13): \"So viel sehe ich aus angef\u00fchrten Versuchen, da\u00df die Luft aus 2 von einander unterschiedenen Flu\u00dfigkeiten bestehe, von welchen die eine die Eigenschaft das Phlogiston anzuziehen gar nicht \u00e4ussere, die andere aber zur solchen Attraction eigentlich aufgeleget ist und welche zwischen dem 3:ten und 4:ten Theil von der ganzen Luftmasse aus machet.\" (So I see [this] much from the experiments [that were] conducted: that the air consists of two fluids [that] differ from one another, of which the one doesn't express at all the property of attracting phlogiston; the other, however, is capable of such attraction and which makes up between 1/3 and 1/4 part of the entire mass of the air.) Henry Cavendish, ; see p. 225.  and Joseph Priestley, ; see: \"VII. Of air infected with the fumes of burning charcoal.\" pp. 225\u201328.  who referred to it as burnt air or phlogisticated air. French chemist Antoine Lavoisier referred to nitrogen gas as \"mephitic air\" or azote, from the Greek word  (azotikos), \"no life\", due to it being mostly inert.Lavoisier, Antoine with Robert Kerr, trans., Elements of Chemistry, 4th ed. (Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech, 1799), pp. 85\u201386. [p. 85]:  \"In reflecting upon the circumstances of this experiment, we readily perceive; that the mercury, during its calcination [i.e., roasting in air], absorbs the salubrious and respirable part of the air, or, to speak more strictly, the base of this respirable part; that the remaining air is a species of mephitis [i.e., a poisonous gas emitted from the earth], incapable of supporting combustion or respiration; \u2026 \" [p. 86]:  \"I shall afterwards shew, that at least in our climate, the atmospheric air is composed of respirable and mephitic airs, in the proportion of 27 and 73; \u2026 \"Lavoisier, Antoine with Robert Kerr, trans., Elements of Chemistry, 4th ed. (Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech, 1799), p. 101: \"The chemical properties of the noxious portion of the atmospheric air being hitherto but little known, we have been satisfied to derive the name of its base from its known quality of killing such animals as are forced to breathe it, giving it the name of azot, from the Greek privitive particle \u03b1 and \u03be\u03c9\u03b7, vita; hence the name of the noxious part of atmospheric air is azotic gas.\" In an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, animals died and flames were extinguished. Though Lavoisier's name was not accepted in English, since it was pointed out that almost all gases (indeed, with the sole exception of oxygen) are mephitic, it is used in many languages (French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Albanian, Turkish, etc.; the German Stickstoff similarly refers to the same characteristic, viz. ersticken \"to choke or suffocate\") and still remains in English in the common names of many nitrogen compounds, such as hydrazine and compounds of the azide ion. Finally, it led to the name \"pnictogens\" for the group headed by nitrogen, from the Greek \u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \"to choke\".Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 406\u201307"]}, {"page": "November 3", "response": ["*1749 \u2013 Daniel Rutherford, Scottish chemist and physician (d. 1819)"]}, {"page": "Phlogiston theory", "response": ["Joseph Black's student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen in 1772 and the pair used the theory to explain his results. The residue of air left after burning, in fact a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, was sometimes referred to as phlogisticated air, having taken up all of the phlogiston.
