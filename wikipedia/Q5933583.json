Contemporary newspaper reports state that he hit the post late on with a shot which could have given him double figures.Russell remained at the club after its re-election to the Football League, but could not repeat his non-league scoring feats, registering just 8 goals in over 60 matches. He was forced to retire through injury in 1952 and later served as the club's trainer before leaving football entirely to work as a hotelier.
