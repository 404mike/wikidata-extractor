A number of clubs were interested at the time, including his home town club Swansea Town, but he signed a contract with Cardiff in February 1949. Despite suffering numerous small injuries during his seven years at the club, he quickly became a regular in the side providing numerous chances for the club's prolific striker Wilf Grant to score 26 goals during the 1951\u201352 season. His injuries meant he never played a full season for the club and in 1956 he was allowed to leave and join Northampton Town. His spell at the club was brief and he moved into non-league football with Bath City and Lovells Athletic before retiring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Williams", "response": ["*Roley Williams (1927\u20131999), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Colin Gale", "response": ["A centre half, Gale began his career with Cardiff City in 1950 but was forced to wait until January 1954 before making his debut for the club in a 3\u20130 win over Manchester City as a right back.
