He was elected to the Royal Society in 1891 and was known for his work as an electrical engineer and as an author. Thompson's most enduring publication is his 1910 text Calculus Made Easy, which teaches the fundamentals of infinitesimal calculus, and is still in print. Thompson also wrote a popular physics text, Elementary Lessons in Electricity and Magnetism, as well as biographies of Lord Kelvin and Michael Faraday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Calculus", "response": ["* Silvanus P.

With these improvements, the system was capable of transmitting signals up to  and over hills.Hong, pp. 20\u201322Marconi, \"Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture, 11 December 1909.\" Nobel Lectures.

The monopole antenna reduced the frequency of the waves compared to the dipole antennas used by Hertz, and radiated vertically polarized radio waves which could travel longer distances. By this point, he concluded that a device could become capable of spanning greater distances, with additional funding and research, and would prove valuable both commercially and militarily. Marconi's experimental apparatus proved to be the first engineering-complete, commercially successful radio transmission system.The Saturday review of politics, literature, science and art, Volume 93. \"THE INVENTOR OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY: A REPLY.

Thompson as Treatise on Light (London: Macmillan, 1912; Project Gutenberg edition, 2005), p.19. proposed that every point to which a luminous disturbance reaches becomes a source of a spherical wave; the sum of these secondary waves determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time. He assumed that the secondary waves travelled only in the \"forward\" direction and it is not explained in the theory why this is the case. He was able to provide a qualitative explanation of linear and spherical wave propagation, and to derive the laws of reflection and refraction using this principle, but could not explain the deviations from rectilinear propagation that occur when light encounters edges, apertures and screens, commonly known as diffraction effects. The resolution of this error was finally explained by David A. B. Miller in 1991. The resolution is that the source is a dipole (not the monopole assumed by Huygens), which cancels in the reflected direction."]}, {"page": "June 19", "response": ["*  1851   \u2013 Silvanus P.
