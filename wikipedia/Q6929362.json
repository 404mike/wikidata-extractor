The family consists of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, and their five daughters, Jane, the novel's protagonist Elizabeth, Mary, Catherine and Lydia.Set in the Regency era, the family belong to the landed gentry of Hertfordshire. Living in a society where marriage is the only purpose and possible future for a young woman of good family, the complex relationships between the Bennets influence the evolution of the plot.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pride and Prejudice", "response": ["* Mr Bennet\u00a0\u2013 A logical and reasonable late-middle-aged landed gentleman of a more modest income of \u00a32000 per annum, and the dryly sarcastic patriarch of the now-dwindling Bennet family (a family of Hertfordshire landed gentry), with five unmarried daughters. His estate, Longbourn, is entailed to the male line. His affection for his wife wore off early in their marriage and is now reduced to mere toleration. He is often described as 'indolent' in the novel. ", "* Mrs Bennet ()\u00a0\u2013 the middle-aged wife of her social superior, Mr Bennet, and the mother of their five daughters (Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Catherine and Lydia). Mrs Bennet is a hypochondriac who imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations (her \"poor nerves\") whenever things are not going her way. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters off to wealthy men. Whether or not any such matches will give her daughters happiness is of little concern to her. She was settled a dowry of \u00a34,000 from her father, Mr Gardiner Sr., most likely invested at 4 percent, allowing her to receive \u00a3160 per annum; it was indicated by Mr Collins during his proposal to Elizabeth [\"to fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demands of that nature on your father since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to\"] that it is probable that her settlement had increased to \u00a35,000 over the years, but remains invested at 4 percent.", "* Mr William Collins\u00a0\u2013 Mr Collins is Mr Bennet's distant second cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir presumptive to his estate of Longbourn House. He is an obsequious and pompous man, prone to making long and tedious speeches, who is excessively devoted to his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.", "Inheritance was by descent but could be further restricted by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her security but she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because married women did not have independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and the children she was to have. The irony of the opening line is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband to have a prosperous life."]}, {"page": "Smirk", "response": ["A smirk may also be an affected, ingratiating smile,B.

This is only established  for Collinses, father and son, are described as Mr. Bennet's 'distant' cousins, that would make Mr. Collins Sr. at the very least Mr. Bennet's first cousin once removed.", "The presumption is that a younger Collins son (possibly an ancestor of Mr. Bennet's) once changed his name to Bennet, possibly in anticipation of receiving an inheritance (as Jane Austen's own brother did; it was a common practice in Georgian England), or vice versa. Readers of the time would have recognized the impossibility of Mr. Collins being the descendant of a female relative of Mr. Bennet's, as entails always descended through a strict male line (although this would not account for how the Bennets and Collinses came to be related to each other in the first place). However, as a grandson born to a daughter would be a closer relative, it is possible that the Collinses do, in fact, descend from a female - they are next in line because his daughters aren't married and there are no other male heirs to inherit, so it passes to the \"son via daughter of a distant Mr Bennet ancestor\", like it would for Mr Bennet's own grandson.", "Emily Auerbach criticises Mr Bennet for ignoring the fate of his daughters and suggests that he possesses \"too little sense of duty or responsibility\".  It is also possible that when he speaks of '[living] for making sport for [one's] neighbours, and laughing at them in our turn', he is also saying the same of himself and his folly of having married Mrs. Bennet in the first place. It is likely that this mistake he had made back as a bachelor is why he is the way he is now (see below).", "If the narrator remains silent on the ancestors of Mr Bennet, we know a little more about the family of his wife: Mrs. Bennet, born a Gardiner and married for twenty-three years (at the start of the novel), is the daughter of an attorney of Meryton in Hertfordshire. She has a brother and a sister, both married. Though equally vulgar, ignorant, thoughtless, tasteless and gossipy, the marriages of the two sisters have resulted in them revolving in different circles (one married a member of the local gentry, the other is wed to one of her late father's law clerks (doing so was probably what made him the successor to his employer's local town law firm)), while their naturally genteel brother has gone on to acquire an education and a higher social status in general trade (in a respectable line of trade) in London.", "Some critics, however, point out that it would be unfair to see only her faults. Her obsession is justified by the family's situation: the cynicism of Mr Bennet will not prevent Mr Collins from inheriting Longbourn. She, at least, unlike her husband, thinks about the future of her daughters in seeking to place them socially, (although it is just as likely that she anticipates being able to rely on them financially in the event of being left a widow). In an environment where there are numerous young ladies to be married (all neighbors: the Longs, the Lucases, have daughters or nieces to marry) and few interesting parties, she is much more attentive to the competition than her husband. She does not neglect her daughters, while he merely treats them mostly as \"stupid and ignorant as all the girls\", and is shut selfishly in his library."]}, {"page": "Death Comes to Pemberley (TV series)", "response": ["* James Fleet as Mr Bennet"]}]}}
