He was educated at Winchester College and received a first class degree in literae humaniores (\"the Greats\") from New College, Oxford.  Stevens remained at Oxford after graduation, receiving scholarships and, in 1933, a  research fellowship at Magdalen College. During the Second World War he worked for British military intelligence, specialising in propaganda. Stevens produced German-language newspapers and broadcasts and suggested the use of the first notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony for Allied broadcasts.  After the war he returned to Magdalen, taking on a huge teaching workload of up to 72 hours per week. Stevens enjoyed success, in partnership with the philosopher J. L. Austin, in preparing students for examination in the Greats.  He served as vice-president of the college from 1950\u201351.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Inklings", "response": ["* Courtenay Edward Stevens"]}, {"page": "Marcian", "response": ["Marcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize Avitus, who succeeded Maximus. Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian Hydatius states that in 455 Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian \"for the sake of unanimity of power,\" and that, \"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\". The exact usage of concord ( in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as Thomas Hodgkin, J. B. Bury, and William Bayless consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; Ernst Stein suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas Norman Baynes believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly. Classicist Courtenay Edward Stevens interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states."]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)", "response": ["Since the Second World War, it has sometimes been referred to as the \"Victory Symphony\". \"V\" is coincidentally also the Roman numeral character for the number five and the phrase \"V for Victory\" became a campaign of the Allies of World War II after Winston Churchill starting using it as a catchword in 1940. Beethoven's Victory Symphony happened to be his Fifth (or vice versa) although this is coincidental. Some thirty years after this piece was written, the rhythm of the opening phrase \u2013 \"dit-dit-dit-dah\" \u2013 was used for the letter \"V\" in Morse code, though this is also coincidental. During the Second World War, the BBC prefaced its broadcasts to Special Operations Executives (SOE) across the world with those four notes, played on drums.  This was at the suggestion of intelligence agent Courtenay Edward Stevens."]}, {"page": "Leila Buckley", "response": ["She married, firstly, the renowned Oxford classicist Courtenay Edward Stevens in 1938. She and Courtenay Stevens were divorced. She married, secondly, Philip Strachan Buckley in 1949."]}]}}
