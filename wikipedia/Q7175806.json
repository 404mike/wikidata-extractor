He is the CEO of Max Learning Limited, the educational arm of the Max Group. He was Headmaster of The Doon School. Before joining Doon in 2009, he served as Headmaster of Douai School, and Principal of the British International School in Cairo and of Casterton School in England. McLaughlin retired from Doon in May 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eton College", "response": ["The Doon School, founded in 1935, is an all-boys' public school in India that was modelled along the lines of Eton and Winchester.  The School's first headmaster was an Englishman, Arthur E. Foot, who had spent nine years as a science master at Eton College before joining Doon. In Doon's early years, teachers from Eton travelled to India to fill the academic posts. Peter Lawrence was one of the first few masters to go to Doon. This led to similar slang being introduced in Doon which is still in use today, such as trials, dame, fagging, and schools (as opposed to 'periods'). In February 2013, Eton's headmaster Tony Little visited Doon to hold talks with the then headmaster of Doon, Peter McLaughlin, on further collaboration between the two schools. Both schools participate in an exchange programme in which boys from either school visit the other for one academic term. Doon has often been described as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as The New York Times, BBC, Channel 4, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, and Forbes, but the school eschews the label."]}, {"page": "The Doon School", "response": ["* Peter McLaughlin, 2009\u20132016", "Kanti Bajpai was the third old boy, after Gulab Ramchandani and Shomie Das, to become headmaster, when appointed to the post in 2003. He introduced numerous punishments, notably \"yellow cards\" (informally known as 'YCs'), to control an outburst of bullying at Doon. In 2006, Bajpai found himself embroiled in a controversy when the parents of Hindu and Sikh students complained on discovering that the school's dining hall only serves halal meat. The fact came to light after a visiting Pakistani delegation was assured of their meal's halal status. Despite mounting pressure, the school's board of governors appealed for maintaining the status quo. As of 2016, the school was serving both halal and non-halal (jhatka) meat varieties in the dining hall.https://www.doonschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2434-FINAL.pdf In 2009, Peter McLaughlin, an Irish academic, was chosen to lead the school, becoming the first non-Indian headmaster in almost four decades.", "In June 2016, the school announced the appointment of Matthew Raggett, principal of the Leipzig International School's secondary department, to succeed Peter McLaughlin as headmaster. Until the start of McLaughlin's headmastership, the student demographic was dominated by boys hailing from the North Indian states. To make the school more diverse, Raggett continued McLaughlin's outreach initiative of inviting more applications from boys in South and Northeast Indian states. The school was the subject of a 2018 Channel 4 documentary series called Indian Summer School, which was based on a social experiment to see if five under-performing British boys would thrive in Doon. In January 2020, Matthew Raggett stepped down as the tenth headmaster citing personal reasons. In March 2020, the school was shut down for the first time since its founding in 1935, and boys were sent home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Indian lockdown. Online classes are being conducted for students through video conferencing apps. Jagpreet Singh was appointed the eleventh headmaster of Doon in April 2020; he is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, UK.", "As private schools became more widespread in India, several other schools used \"Doon\" as part of their names, causing some confusion. Among them are Doon Global School, Doon Presidency School, Doon International School, Doon Preparatory School, Doon Cambridge School, Doon Girls School, Doon Public School (in West Delhi, not the Doon Valley) and the Doon College of Spoken English. None of them are related to The Doon School. Former Headmaster Peter McLaughlin had, during his tenure, sought to copyright the school's name and initiate legal proceedings against institutions falsely presenting themselves as connected to the school, but was unsuccessful."]}, {"page": "Prince Edward School", "response": ["* Peter McLaughlin \u2013 academic, historian, and educator"]}, {"page": "Mount Pleasant, Harare", "response": ["* Peter McLaughlin, Northern Irish-Zimbabwean educator, historian, and school administrator"]}, {"page": "Hennepin County Sheriff's Office", "response": ["Hundreds of citizens protested daily at Hennepin County Government Center and Minneapolis City Hall  Among political leaders opposed to Sheriff Rich Stanek's decision were Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith, U.S. Representative  Keith Ellison, state Representative Peggy Flanagan, state Representative Karen Clark, state Senator Patricia Torres Ray, Minneapolis City Council members Alondra Cano and Cameron Gordon, Civil rights organizer Clyde Bellecourt and Hennepin County commissioners Marion Greene, Linda Higgins, and Peter McLaughlin who, in a Facebook post said, \"Indian Nations have a special interest in this issue and that interest must be protected!

Moorcraft and McLaughlin comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been \"impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits.\" Sibanda describes Freedom Camp as \"a refugee camp for boys\", and says \"351 boys and girls\" were killed.
