Born in Bilston, Staffordshire, to an Irish father and a Welsh mother, Doughty started his football career with Druids before joining Newton Heath in June 1886. He was in the Heathens team that first joined the Football Alliance in the 1889\u201390 season, and made his debut on 30 October 1886 against Fleetwood Rangers in the FA Cup. He left Newton Heath in 1891.\nDoughty made his debut for the Welsh national team in 1886, in a match against Scotland. He scored four goals in one match for Wales in a game against Ireland national football team in March 1888, a match in which his brother Roger, also a Newton Heath player, scored two goals.

The second of these, at Ninian Park on 11 April 1962 for the 1962 British Home Championship, finished 4\u20130, and it was Charles who scored all four of the goals.
