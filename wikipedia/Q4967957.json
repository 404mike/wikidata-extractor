She was the eldest of four daughters of the Swedish-born artist Anthony Rubens Montalba, all of whom achieved considerable artistic success, though Clara was arguably the most successful and best-known of the four. Between 1879 and 1889 she exhibited her work at the Grosvenor Gallery, London. An early feminist, in 1886 she was named by Millicent Garrett Fawcett as one of twenty successful and accomplished women who had given \"warm help and support\" to the movement. In 1892, in recognition of her artistic talent, she was admitted into the Royal Watercolour Society. She died in Venice in 1929.", "link_mentions": {}}}
