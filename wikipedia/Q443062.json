Gosse created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and coined the term \"aquarium\" when he published the first manual, The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea, in 1854. His work was the catalyst for an aquarium craze in early Victorian England.Gosse was also the author of Omphalos, an attempt to reconcile the geological ages presupposed by Charles Lyell with the biblical account of creation. After his death, Gosse was portrayed as an overbearing father of uncompromising religious views in Father and Son (1907), a memoir written by his son, Edmund Gosse, a poet and critic.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 6", "response": ["*1810 \u2013 Philip Henry Gosse, English biologist and academic (d. 1888)"]}, {"page": "Creationism", "response": ["The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, Omphalos by Philip Henry Gosse, in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be functional God must have created the Earth with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with fully grown hair, fingernails, and navels (\u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 omphalos is Greek for \"navel\"), and all living creatures with fully formed evolutionary features, etc..., and that, therefore, no empirical evidence about the age of the Earth or universe can be taken as reliable."]}, {"page": "Omphalos hypothesis", "response": ["The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, Omphalos by Philip Henry Gosse, in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be \"functional\", God must have created the Earth with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with fully grown hair, fingernails, and navels (\u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 omphalos is Greek for \"navel\"), and all living creatures with fully formed evolutionary features, etc..., and that, therefore, no empirical evidence about the age of the Earth or universe can be taken as reliable."]}, {"page": "1888", "response": ["* August 23\u00a0\u2013 Philip Henry Gosse, British scientist (b. 1810)"]}, {"page": "Worcester, England", "response": ["*Philip Henry Gosse, naturalist, was born in Worcester in 1810."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Philip Henry Gosse (1810\u20131888), English naturalist,Abbreviation in zoology: Gosse originator of the Omphalos hypothesis, or \"Last Thursdayism\""]}, {"page": "Evelyn Waugh", "response": ["Arthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903Eade, p. 13 to Arthur Waugh (1866\u20131943) and Catherine Charlotte Raban (1870\u20131954), into a family with English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Huguenot origins.

His father was a naturalist and his mother an illustrator who published a number of books of poetry. Both were deeply committed to a small Protestant sect, the Plymouth Brethren. His childhood was initially happy as they spent their summers in Devon where his father was developing the ideas which gave rise to the craze for the marine aquarium. After his mother died of breast cancer when he was eight and they moved to Devon, his life with his father became increasingly strained by his father's expectations that he should follow in his religious tradition. Gosse was sent to a boarding school where he began to develop his own interests in literature. His father re-married in 1860 the deeply religious Quaker spinster Eliza Brightwen (1813\u20131900), whose brother Thomas tried to encourage Edmund to become a banker. He later gave an account of his childhood in the book Father and Son which has been described as the first psychological biography. At the age of 18 and working in the British Museum in London, he broke away from his father's influence in a dramatic coming of age.", "* The Life of Philip Henry Gosse, F.R.S.
