Most of his career took place before cricket's statistical record began with regular scorecards in 1772.  He made five known appearances in first-class cricket matches between 1773 and 1778.\nPhillips was primarily a batsman who scored a known total of 117 runs in 10 innings with a highest score of 31.  He has not been credited with any wickets.  He took just 1 catch, which suggests he may have been an outfielder.", "link_mentions": {}}}
