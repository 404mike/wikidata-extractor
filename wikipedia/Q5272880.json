According to Nigel West the SIS believed that Ellis had been a spy for the Abwehr. Ellis was accused by Chapman Pincher of being a traitor. During the 1980s, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to confirm or deny Pincher's allegation caused distress to the Ellis family.Ellis was born in Sydney, to parents who had emigrated from Devon, and spent his early life in Melbourne and Tasmania. In 1914, he travelled to England, intending to study at Oxford University.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
