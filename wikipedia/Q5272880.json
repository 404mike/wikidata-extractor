According to Nigel West the SIS believed that Ellis had been a spy for the Abwehr. Ellis was accused by Chapman Pincher of being a traitor. During the 1980s, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to confirm or deny Pincher's allegation caused distress to the Ellis family.Ellis was born in Sydney, to parents who had emigrated from Devon, and spent his early life in Melbourne and Tasmania. In 1914, he travelled to England, intending to study at Oxford University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Ellis", "response": ["*Dick Ellis (1895\u20131975), British intelligence officer"]}, {"page": "Ellis", "response": ["* Dick Ellis (1895\u20131975), treacherous intelligence officer"]}, {"page": "British Security Co-ordination", "response": ["* Dick Ellis \u2013 deputy-head, post-war accused of being spy for the Germans and the Soviets"]}, {"page": "Annandale, New South Wales", "response": ["*Dick Ellis, a soldier and intelligence officer"]}, {"page": "Charles Ellis", "response": ["* Dick Ellis (Charles Howard Ellis, 1895\u20131975), Australian soldier and intelligence officer"]}, {"page": "Malleson mission", "response": ["Dick Ellis served as an officer with the Malleson mission, writing his account, The Transcaspian Episode, after he had retired."]}, {"page": "Charles Howard Ellis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dick Ellis"]}, {"page": "Mr C.
