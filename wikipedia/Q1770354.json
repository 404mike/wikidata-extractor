He had loans at Stockport County, Colchester United, Carlisle United and Scunthorpe United before moving permanently to the latter in 2012. In his two seasons as a Scunthorpe player, the team were relegated from, and promoted back to, League One. He then represented Exeter City, and two years later moved to Oxford United.
