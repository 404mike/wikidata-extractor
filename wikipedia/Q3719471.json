Edmund Fellowes praised it as the last masterpiece in the English school of lutenist song before John Attey's First Booke of Ayres of Foure Parts, with Tableture for the Lute (1622). \"Not the least remarkable feature of [The English School of Lutenist song-writers] was the shortness of the period during which it shone so brilliantly: for it began with the publication of John Dowland's first volume in 1597 and practically ended with the same composer's A Pilgrim's Solace published in 1612; John Attey's volume followed this [...] in 1622 as an isolated and final example of the same class of composition.\" John Palmer also wrote, \"Although this book produced no hits, it is arguably Dowland's best set, evincing his absorption of the style of the Italian monodists.\""]}, {"page": "Orlando Gibbons", "response": ["By the 1610s Gibbons had become a composer of high repute and the most outstanding organist in England. He became a close friend of Sir Christopher Hatton, the second cousin and heir of the more famous Christopher Hatton, favourite of Queen Elizabeth I. Though Hatton was a minor figure in court, he became an important patron to Gibbons. The next few years saw the publishing of various works by Gibbons, firstly his 1612 First Set of Madrigals and Motets from the patronage of Hatton. One of the Madrigals in the set was, The Silver Swan, often considered the most famous English madrigal. Gibbons dedicated the entire set of works to Hatton: \"[The songs] were most of them composed in your owne [sic] house, and doe therefore properly belong unto you, as Lord of the Soile; the language they speake you provided them, I onely furnished them with Tongues to utter the same name\". The English musician Frederick Bridge interpreted this as implying that Hatton wrote some or all of the poems that Gibbons set to music in his Madrigals and Motets. Additionally, the musicologist Edmund Fellowes noted that it is unlikely Gibbons was an actual resident of Hatton's household, although their friendship suggests that Hatton may have set a room aside for him to compose. The death of King James's son, Prince Henry Frederick, was a considerable shock to the English, as many considered him a promising heir to the Kingdom. James in particular went into a deep depression; many wrote works to mourn his death, including writers Ben Jonson and George Chapman as well as composers John Coperario and the retired Byrd. Among these was probably Gibbons's Nay let me weep from the recently published First Set of Madrigals and Motets. It is also possible that the full anthem I am the resurrection was for Prince Henry's burial, though there is no firm evidence for this."]}, {"page": "The Triumphs of Oriana", "response": ["Recently, the attribution of \"Oriana\" to Elizabeth has come into question.  Evidence has been presented that \"Oriana\" actually refers to Anne of Denmark, who would become Queen of England alongside James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) in an apparently failed early attempt to remove Elizabeth in order to restore England to Catholicism.Jeremy L. Smith, \"Music and Late Elizabethan Politics: The Identities of Oriana and Diana.\"  Journal of the American Musicological Society, vol. 58, pp 508-558 (Fall, 2005).

While studying for his doctorate with Thurston Dart, he found over 50 music manuscripts from a single documented scriptorium, and identified the hitherto anonymous songs for voice and viols in one of the manuscripts as late works of William Byrd. He edited the whole corpus for Musica Britannica in 1967 and Byrd's own songs separately in 1970. Brett collaborated with Dart in revising a series by Edmund Fellowes on English madrigal composers. He also revised one of the volumes in the Collected Works of William Byrd (another Fellowes project) and demonstrated the doubtful authenticity of many of the pieces which Fellowes had attributed to Byrd.Scott and Morgan On Dart's recommendation, Brett was appointed General Editor of the new seventeen-volume Byrd Edition, which revised (and in some cases replaced) the work begun by Fellowes. Brett worked on the series right up until his death and edited several of the volumes himself. The final volume was published in 2005. According to Anthony Bye writing in The Musical Times, it was to become the first modern multi-volume, critical edition of a major English composer to reach completion.Bye (2002) The extensive introductions which Brett had written to the volumes on Byrd's Gradualia were published posthumously as a separate monograph in William Byrd and His Contemporaries: Essays and a Monograph (2007)."]}, {"page": "Ellis Gibbons", "response": ["At the age of 28 he became the only composer, other than the editor Thomas Morley himself, to contribute two madrigals to The Triumphs of Oriana, a collection of 25 madrigals by 23 composers (most a part of the informal English Madrigal School), published in 1601. He is known to have married Joan Dyer, likely the sister of the James Dyer who married Gibbons' sister Elizabeth in 1600, by at least November 1602; the couple did not have children. In April 1603, Gibbons' mother died and left him as executor and residuary legatee of her will. Soon after Gibbons himself would write his own will on 14 May 1603, from which much of what is known about Gibbons comes from. Since the will was proved only 4 days later by his brother Edward, musicologist Edmund Fellowes speculated that the 14 May 1603 was also Gibbons' date of death. He was probably buried in the parish of St Benet Paul's Wharf, London and while his cause of death is unknown, he may have succumbed to the plague which killed nearly a quarter of London's population that year. His will gave his properties as life estates to his wife Joan, with the remainder to his brother Edward; he gave a legacy of \u00a320 to the child of his sister Elizabeth."]}, {"page": "English Singers", "response": ["In 1917 the bass singer Cuthbert Kelly founded a quartet of singers, having previously staged wartime concerts at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields.Pears, p. 1.

The audience was entranced.

He lived in King's for the rest of his life, never leaving it for more than a few weeks."]}, {"page": "Edward Gibbons", "response": ["By 1598, Hammond likely resumed his position as choirmaster, with Gibbons's subsequent whereabouts being uncertain for a few years. At no point was he the organist of Bristol Cathedral as Wood and other early biographies record. Modern musicologists do not accept this claim since the detailed surviving records of Bristol do not include Gibbons's name. Musicologist Edmund Fellowes noted, however, that \"It is not impossible that he may have been organist of one of the city churches in Bristol, for the tradition is of early origin\". Gibbons is known to have lived in Exeter by 1607, as his son William was baptised there on 24 October 1607. Gibbons's mother died in April 1603, and his brother Ellis two months later; in Ellis's will, Edward Gibbons is recorded as \"of Acton\", presumably Acton, London. However, no records of his activity there exist, and it is possible that 'Acton' is a typo for 'Exeter', meaning that Gibbons could have settled in Exeter as early as 1603. William Cotton had become Bishop of Exeter on 12 November 1598, and according to 18th-century historian John Walker, Cotton urged Gibbons to come to Exeter Cathedral at this time. This suggests Gibbons moved to Exeter immediately after his 1598 leave from King's, which would create a logical chronology of this period. From 25 June 1608 on, Gibbons taught choristers at the Exeter Cathedral, with a salary of 50 and a quarter shillings split between him and the organist John Lugge. From 1638 to 1641, and perhaps earlier, the future composer Matthew Locke was among his choristers. Records suggest that Gibbons often put his subordinate Greenwood Randall in charge. Some of Gibbons's few surviving compositions were probably written by this time."]}]}}
