The issue lies in the fact that there is no record of Egyptian princesses around this time being used to form alliances through marriage. As Brian Roberts stated, \"The problem is not with the synchronism of Solomon and [Pharaoh] Siamun per se, yet with the problems of attempting to fit the process of marrying out a daughter to a foreign leader. It is not a thing the ultra-orthodox Dynasty 21 would have done... We have an earlier example of the opposite, in fact. The king of the Mitanni had asked Amenhotep II for his daughter's hand in order to cement a political alliance. Amenhotep refused, offended by the suggestion that an Egyptian princess be submitted for that ridicule of being married off to a foreign leader.\""]}, {"page": "Brian Roberts", "response": ["Brian Roberts may refer to:", "*Brian Roberts (Australian rules footballer) (1945\u20132016), Australian rules footballer", "*Brian Roberts (English footballer) (born 1955), English football defender", "*Brian Roberts (New Zealand footballer) (born 1967), New Zealand international footballer", "*Brian Roberts (baseball) (born 1977), American baseball player", "*Brian Roberts (soccer) (born 1982), American soccer player", "*Brian Roberts (basketball) (born 1985), American basketball player", "*Brian Roberts (historian) (born 1930), British historian on South African history", "*Brian Robertson (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Brian Roberts (Historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Roberts (historian) "]}, {"page": "Philip Bawcombe", "response": ["Back in South Africa from 1968, art works for two books illustrating the historical townscapes of Johannesburg and Kimberley were amongst projects taken up in the early to mid-1970s.
