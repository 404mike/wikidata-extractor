He is best known for his 1982 single \"Hilly Fields (1892)\". Nicely released only one other record in the early 1980s, the single \"D.C.T. Dreams\", before retreating from the music industry. The influence of \"Hilly Fields\" has been noted on Bevis Frond, Robyn Hitchcock, Robert Wyatt, and XTC's psychedelic alter egos the Dukes of Stratosphear, as well as the hypnagogic pop movement of the 2000s.Nicely was born in Greenland during a transatlantic flight layover and grew up in Hitchin, a town near London. In the late 1980s, he became involved with the burgeoning acid house and rave scene in the UK. With collaborator Gavin Mills, the duo produced a number of house tracks in the early 1990s under the names Psychotropic, Freefall and Airtight and enjoyed some chart success. Following years of negotiations, a compilation of Nicely's two singles and unreleased tracks recorded between 1978 and 2004, titled Psychotropia, was released in 2004. Since then, he has released three LPs of new material: Lysergia (2011), Space of a Second (2014), and Sleep Safari (2017).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "XTC", "response": ["When Gregory joined the band in 1979, Partridge learned that they both shared a longtime enthusiasm for 1960s psychedelic music.

Stevie Moore and Martin Newell were earlier artists who anticipated Pink's sound. Matthew Ingram of The Wire recognized Moore's influence on Pink and hypnagogic pop: \"through his disciple ... he has unwittingly provided the [genre's] template\". Another precursor to the genre was Nick Nicely and his 1982 single \"Hilly Fields (1892)\". Red Bull Musics J.R. Moore wrote that Nicely's \"uniquely haphazard DIY aesthetic\" and contemporary take on 1960s psychedelic pop \"basically invented the sound of the 2000s Hypnagogic Pop movement decades beforehand.\""]}, {"page": "Psychotropia", "response": ["Psychotropia is the debut album by English psychedelic musician Nick Nicely (typically stylised in lower case as nick nicely), first released as an LP by Tenth Planet in 2003 and as a CD by Castle Music in 2004. Nicely had started fusing psychedelic and electronic music in the late 1970s, and in the early 1980s he released two singles, \"DCT Dreams\" and \"Hilly Fields (1892)\". While the singles were critically acclaimed, they were commercial failures, which partly contributed to Nicely's retirement from the public eye shortly after. While his works were being praised by several of his contemporaries, he continued to record  material into the mid-1980s, and then again in the late 1990s.", "===Nick Nicely's career===", "Growing up in Hitchin and Deptford, England, Nick Nicely developed an early fascination with intricate psychedelic music in the 1960s, from artists like Joe Meek, the Beatles, Pink Floyd and King Crimson. His discovery of the eclectic folk compilation Nice Enough to Eat (1969), which featured styles of \"guitar freak-outs, blues, pastoral folk and psych,\" was one of his formative influences, and in the mid-1970s he developed into a folk singer, but he soon found inspiration in Euro-disco and from German electronic groups like Neu!, Can and Kraftwerk. He moved to London and developed a solo career, and his 1978 home recordings attracted the attention of music publisher Heath Levy, who intended him to work as an in-house songwriter. Nevertheless, after hearing more of Nicely's demos, they let him record the songs \"DCT Dreams\" and \"Treeline\" on an advance sum in a professional studio.", "Phares states that while Nicely had other tracks ready to release as singles, the commercial failure of \"Hilly Fields\" and the lack of royalties he received from \"DCT Dreams\" meant Nicely was unable to create music in the fashion he desired and he thus retired from the public eye, his only released musical contributions for the remainder of the 20th century being backing vocals on Paul Roland's A Cabinet of Curiosities (1987) and acid house and rave music collaborations with his friend Gavin Mills under the names Psychotropic, Airtight and Freefall. Besides his rave music, he continued to be inspired by other music in the two decades, including New Order's \"Blue Monday\" (1983), Tears for Fears' Songs from the Big Chair (1985) and Portishead's Dummy (1994). In 1997, he once again began recording as Nick Nicely, with new tracks like \"On the Beach\" both reflecting his dance music productions as well as his early 1980s sound.", "During his time away from the public eye, Nicely's unusual blend of electronic pop and psychedelic rock had influenced contemporaries including Robyn Hitchcock of the Soft Boys and Andy Partridge of XTC, while Robert Wyatt spoke highly of \"49 Cigars\". XTC's psychedelic side project band the Dukes of Stratosphear were especially inspired by Nicely, with their debut album 25 O'Clock (1985) drawing strong influence from \"Hilly Fields (1892)\". Interest in Nicely as a \"lost legend\" continued to grow into the 2000s, to the point where British music reissue compiler David Wells, who specialised in compiling compilations of psychedelic music, discovered that Nicely had recorded a wealth of unreleased material beyond his early 1980s singles. Hoping to bring the unreleased material together, he chiefly conceived the idea for Psychotropia, a collection of both Nicely's released and unreleased material, to which Nicely agreed. The album is Nicely's first album and first release as Nick Nicely since 1982. John Reed, Jon Richards and Steve Hammonds are credited as the album's coordinators. Nicely remastered all the tracks himself.", "One account said that the album was released to acclaim from music critics. Reviewing the original LP release, Richard Mason of Ugly Things was favourable, praising the album's \"uncanny feel of a realised and structured album rather than the compilation it actually is. This is surely a testament to the singular originality and determinedly individualistic talent of Nick Nicely. The lyrical and musical continuity is startling. Beautiful, wistful melodies comprised with a lyrical bent of a deeply personal and impressionistic nature.\" Among those reviewing the CD, Matthjis Linneman of OOR highly recommended the album and wrote that, despite Nicely's career ending with commercial failure in 1982, Psychotropia \"proves that his song writing abilities have remained constant over the years\" while away from the public eye, citing for instance \"On the Beach (The Ladder Descends)\", which he felt \"approaches the quality of 'Hilly Fields'\". Adam Clayson of Record Collector called Psychotropia \"[a] retrospective that transcends mere period charm\".", "In gathering Nicely's material in an anthology style, Psychotropia helped make it easier to listen to his body of work, and since the album's release, his reputation has grown. Acclaim for the album poured in from artists including Ariel Pink and John Maus, both of whom Nicely would perform live dates with in 2012 and touring the USA opening for Maus in 2019. Other artists from American underground music such as Nite Jewel and Gary War also praised the album. The simultaneous hypnagogic pop scene, to which Ariel Pink and John Maus are linked, revived interest in Nicely's work, and today his 1980s recordings are seen as \"the sound of the 2000s hypnagogic pop movement decades beforehand\". Rock band Temples called Psychotropia a \"completely overlooked album. It should be a classic album, but it\u2019s overlooked completely.\" Unkle enjoyed the album, and approached Nicely for collaboration on their song \"Puppeteers\" (2011), a song Nicely described as more psychedelic than his usual style. Amorphous Androgynous included \"49 Cigars\" on their critically acclaimed various artists compilation A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind: Volume 1 (2008). Nick Nicely would begin making music more regularly, releasing several albums in the 2010s, including Space of a Second (2014) and Sleep Safari (2017).", "All songs written by Nick Nicely, except where noted", "*Nick Nicely \u2013 writing, remastering", "Category:Nick Nicely albums"]}, {"page": "Fruits de Mer Records", "response": ["*Nick Nicely"]}, {"page": "Hilly Fields, Lewisham", "response": ["In 1982, musician Nick Nicely, who lived in Brockley at the time, released the single \"Hilly Fields (1892)\" inspired by the park."]}]}}
