It starred Gary Sweet as Don Bradman, Hugo Weaving as Douglas Jardine, Jim Holt as Harold Larwood, Rhys McConnochie as Pelham Warner, and Frank Thring as Jardine's mentor Lord Harris. The series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama, including a depiction of angry Australian fans burning a British flag at the Sydney Cricket Ground, an event which was never documented.Frith, p. 386. Larwood, having emigrated to Australia in 1950, was largely welcomed with open arms, although received several threatening and obscene phone calls after the series aired.Frith, p. 387. The series was widely and strongly attacked by the surviving players for its inaccuracy and sensationalism."]}, {"page": "1988 in film", "response": ["| Crocodile Dundee II || Paramount Pictures || John Cornell (director); Paul Hogan, Brett Hogan (screenplay); Paul Hogan, Linda Kozlowski, John Meillon, Hechter Ubarry, Juan Fernandez, Charles S.
