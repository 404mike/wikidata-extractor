His only appearance in a World Championship Grand Prix came at the 1953 RAC British Grand Prix, in which - due to ignition failure - he failed to finish in his Ecurie Ecosse-entered Connaught-Lea Francis A. Stewart's main competition was as part of the Jaguar racing Ecurie Ecosse team.Stewart made a name for himself racing a Jaguar XK120 in British national events, winning 23 races in just three seasons, including the Jersey International and the Wakefield Trophy. He was a founder member of Ecurie Ecosse who adopted the colour he had resprayed his XK120 as their team colour, he was also responsible for their distinctive badge. During this period, he was one of three Ecurie Ecosse drivers for the team's debut race at Charterhall, which resulted in a second place for Stewart. It was with the Merchiston team that Stewart won most of his races. This success led to some works outings for the Jaguar marque at Le Mans.It is often said that during the 1954 Les 24 Heures du Mans he rolled an Aston Martin DB3S on the fast stretch between Arnage and White House corners; that however was Jimmy Stewart, Jackie's older brother. Ian had already retired from racing following a crash in the 1954 Argentinian 1000k sports car race to tend to his family's agricultural and public house businesses in Perth and Kinross.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 15", "response": ["*  1929   \u2013 Ian Stewart, Scottish race car driver (d. 2017)"]}, {"page": "Ian Stewart", "response": ["Ian Stewart may refer to:", "*Ian Stewart (RAF officer), current United Kingdom National Military Representative, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe", "*Ian Stewart (Labour politician) (born 1950), Scottish politician", "*Ian Stewart, Baron Stewartby (1935\u20132018), British Conservative Party politician and former MP for Hitchin, England", "*Ian Stewart (athlete) (born 1949), Scottish Olympic athlete", "*Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer) (born 1943), member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame", "*Ian Stewart (baseball) (born 1985), major league baseball player", "*Ian Stewart (Northern Ireland footballer) (born 1961), member of the 1986 Northern Ireland Football World Cup team", "*Ian Stewart (racing driver) (1929\u20132017), Scottish Formula One driver", "*Ian Stewart (Scottish footballer) (born 1945/46), Scottish football player and manager", "*Ian Stewart (mathematician) (born 1945),  English academic and science fiction author", "*Ian Stewart (musician) (1938\u20131985), British musician and early member of the Rolling Stones", "*Ian Stewart (police commissioner), former Commissioner of the Queensland Police Service (2012\u20132019)", "*Ian Stewart, founder of Gremlin Interactive and Zoo Digital", "*Ian Stewart (priest) (born 1943), Dean of Brechin"]}, {"page": "Jaguar C-Type", "response": ["In 1952, Jaguar, worried by a report about the speed of the Mercedes-Benz 300SLs that would run at Le Mans, modified the C-Type\u2019s aerodynamics to increase the top speed. However, the consequent rearrangement of the cooling system made the cars vulnerable to overheating, and all three retired from the race. The Peter Whitehead-Ian Stewart and Tony Rolt/Duncan Hamilton cars blew head gaskets, and the Stirling Moss-Peter Walker car, the only one not overheating having had a full-sized radiator hurriedly fitted, lost oil pressure after a mechanical breakage. Testing by Norman Dewis at MIRA after the race proved that the overheating was caused more by the revisions to the cooling system than by the altered aerodynamics: the water pump pulley was undersized, so it was spinning too fast and causing cavitation; also the header tank was in front of the passenger-side bulkhead, far from the radiator, and the tubing diameter was too small at 7/8 inch. With the pump pulley enlarged, and the tubing increased to 1 1/4 inch, the problem was eliminated. The main drawback of the new body shape was that it reduced downforce on the tail to the extent that it caused lift and directional instability at speeds over  on the Mulsanne Straight. These cars had chassis numbers XKC 001, 002 and 011. The first two were dismantled at the factory, and the third survives in normal C-type form.", "When new, the car sold for about $6,000, approximately twice the price of an XK120.

["Also in 1953, Coombs earned a test at Snetterton with the Connaught Engineering factory team, alongside Roy Salvadori, Jack Fairman and Ian Stewart. Salvadori was fastest with Coombs second, and Coombs was subsequently entered into a number of Formula Two races both in the UK and abroad. In 1954, he bought a 1.5 litre Connaught and soon replaced it with a Lotus Mark VIII, retaining the Connaught engine. With this car he achieved a number of second place finishes, and won the Cornwall MRC Formula 1 Race at Davidstow Circuit on 2 August 1954, marking the first victory for a Lotus in a Formula One race, although the Mark VIII was not a Formula One car.\"Davidstow: A History of Cornwall's Formula One Race Circuit\", Peter Tutthill, West Country Motor Books, 1996."]}, {"page": "Saint Helier Circuit", "response": ["|  Ian Stewart"]}, {"page": "1953 1000km of N\u00fcrburgring", "response": ["For the second round running, the Scottish Ecurie Ecosse finished second overall.

A total of 45 cars were initially registered for the event on 24 August. However, many teams decided to withdraw their registrations. These included the private Jaguar entrants of J. B. Swift and T. H. Wisdom, the Porsche's due to recent crashes in races at the weekend prior to the event. The Italian Stanguellini cars were withdrawn, potentially due to a shortage of cars due to recent crashes. Only 28 entrants arrived for practice and qualifying. None of the leading works teams made the trip across to Northern Ireland from mainland Europe. However, from England, the two works teams of Jaguar Cars Ltd. and Aston Martin took part. The team from Coventry arrived with three cars, Jaguar C-Types for the all British pairings of Tony Rolt/Duncan Hamilton, Stirling Moss/Peter Walker and Peter Whitehead/Ian Stewart. Aston Martin also brought along three of their DB3S, with Reg Parnell pairing up alongside Eric Thompson.
