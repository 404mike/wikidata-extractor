Meanwhile, Lester had to deal with an old rival Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson), an unscrupulous government official who hoped to obtain the power of the anomalies and the Future Predators for military uses. With the assistance of Sarah Page (Laila Rouass), a professor employed at the British Museum, Cutter begins to piece together a map of all anomalies, based on folklore, and begins using them to make predictions about where anomalies will occur next. Helen tries to invade the ARC with an army of cleaner clones (including a clone of Cutter), with the intention of killing the real Cutter to stop his research causing the downfall of life on Earth. Cutter takes an artefact from Helen, and is shot and killed by her in the process, with his \"prediction map\" being completely destroyed. Connor obtains the artefact and discovers that it was in fact a map similar to the one devised by Cutter to predict anomalies. However, they are not able to get it to work, but they do manage to create a device to lock anomalies and prevent creatures coming through. Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng), a former police detective who became involved after discovering his brother had been killed by a creature from the future, becomes the team leader following Cutter's death, while Jenny departs after having nearly died, and realising that Cutter's talk of Claudia Brown was in fact all true after seeing his photo of her. Connor and Abby's relationship grows, despite her brother Jack moving into her flat and going through an anomaly to the future. Helen returns near the series' end, with a device that opens anomalies at will, revealing that she will go back to eradicate the human race by killing the first hominids, in a second attempt to stop the future the team had seen coming to pass. She kills Christine and travels back to the future, followed by Danny, Connor and Abby. While Abby and an injured Connor are forced to remain in the late Cretaceous, Danny catches up with Helen in the prehistoric past and Helen is killed by a raptor that had followed Danny into the Pliocene.

Becker assisted the team in returning creatures, such as the Pristichampsus and Diictodon, back home, and began to become more involved in the action when a Giganotosaurus and a fungus from the future appeared. He often questioned Danny Quinn's (Jason Flemyng) judgement, but was nevertheless loyal and obeys orders, even if he disagrees with them. In episode 3.6 he appeared to be working with Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) after she took control the ARC from Lester, but this was later revealed to be a ploy between him and Lester to bring Johnson down. He helped Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) rescue the Dracorex in episode 3.7, and accompanied the team into the future in episode 3.8 (almost dying in a fight against a pack of Future Predators) in order to keep them safe. In episode 3.10 he and Sarah Page (Laila Rouass) fought the Megopteran in the present day, and as a result was one of only three main cast members to be in the present at the end of Series 3 (the others being Sarah and Lester).", "In episode 3.1 she is seen in a future time period stealing an artefact from Christine Johnson's (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) military force and barely escapes with her life as predators are in the building. At the conclusion of the episode, Helen sets up an operational headquarters in the present day, assisted by the clones. In episode 3.3, after taking the ARC with her clones, she attempts to explain herself to Cutter that she can prevent future atrocities (such as the rise of the Future Predators) by actively changing timelines in the past so that evolution and history take a different path. Cutter rejects this, insisting that Helen has no right to meddle. Helen also seems to believe that Cutter's work with the ARC is in some way responsible for the atrocities she has seen in the future and thus intended to kill him in order to avoid it once he translates the artefact for her. She is caught in the blast from the bomb in the ARC and Cutter returns to rescue her only for her to shoot him and leave him to die. Donning the alias of Eve (Kate Magowan), she uses Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) to get into the new ARC headquarters to regain the artefact, now believing that the only means to ensure the Future Predators' timeline never occurs is by negating humanity itself. She attempts to do this in the finale of Series 3 and is responsible for the death of the so-called \"First Family\". She briefly confronts Danny in the Pliocene, stating that when humanity is gone, other species will be able to develop in peace with no war or pollution. Helen is killed by a raptor before she can complete her mission.", "Christine Johnson (played by Belinda Stewart-Wilson, ex-wife of Ben Miller) is the military liaison to the ARC in series three. Ostensibly, her role is to provide the assistance of the armed forces to deal with the problems caused by the anomalies. However, it is apparent she has other objectives.", "In Series 3, Lester's fight become more personal when he discovers Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) working against him, who he has connections to. In episode 3.3 he is rounded up and imprisoned with the rest of the ARC by Helen and her clones, and shows little surprise at Cutter's apparent betrayal \"So, Cutter's finally gone native\". When Cutter lies dying after the ARC explosion, Lester yells desperately for an ambulance for him. In the following episode he makes Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown) team leader, and then assigns Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) to the same role the episode after. When he discovers Connor living in the ARC with the two Diictodon he offers him his spare apartment, although later appears to be annoyed at the mess Connor and his \"pets\" make. In episode 3.6 he is stripped of command of the ARC by Christine, although with the help of Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) he regains it later in the episode, telling Christine that she is \"sitting in his chair\" mirroring one of her lines earlier that episode. In episode 3.9 Lester commands Danny not to invade Christine's HQ to rescue Eve (Kate Magowan), and becomes annoyed at him when he does, and appears ready to hand Danny over to Christine until Eve is revealed as Helen.", "In episode 3.6, she is forced to go into hiding with Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng), Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) and Connor after Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) takes over the ARC, she and the rest of the team are forced to take refuge in an old abandoned cabin. When Lester is reinstated to the ARC thanks to Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield), Sarah kisses Becker on the cheek as a reward. After episode 3.6, she takes a more hands on approach and goes out with the team to the anomaly sites, she goes back in time to find out information about the knight who came through an anomaly. In episode 3.9, she finds out that the woman who Danny is with is actually Helen Cutter in disguise, but she is too late to stop her from taking Christine hostage. In episode 3.10, she and Becker are the only two members of the team to be in the present day, with Connor, Abby and Danny stuck on the other sides of different anomalies. She ends by saying she has an idea although it is unexplained what this is.", "While checking security in the ARC he breaks through the ventilation shafts and then battles the terror birds, tricking them into the anomaly by using a loud speakerphone recording of their calling. He later battles Sir William, a medieval knight, and is almost run through by his sword. He is revealed to know Latin fairly fluently. During a trip to the future in episode 3.8, he witnessed Eve (Kate Magowan) - Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) in disguise - enter the present, and in the following episode rescued her from Christine Johnson's (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) base, returning her to the ARC before realising who she really was. Along with Connor, Sarah, Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) and Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) he follows her back to Christine's HQ and witnesses the death of Christine at the hands of a Future Predator. In the following episode he travels back to the future with Connor and Abby, only to chase Helen into the past, and onwards into the deeper past alone, after Connor is injured. Danny witnesses the death of Helen in the deep past, and assures that the human race survives, before finding himself stranded when the anomaly closes. Trapped, alone in the past, Danny cries out in anger as Series 3 draws to a close.", "In the third season his and Abby's relationship continues to grow stronger, though neither continue to do anything about it. In episode 3.3, he adopts a pair of Diictodon trapped in the present, naming them Sid and Nancy. After the ARC exploded Connor ran back into the building to find Cutter. When he did he found that he had been shot. Connor wants to help him, but Cutter tells him to sit down and they start to talk. Cutter tells him that he is now in charge and has to carry on his work of tracking and exploring the anomalies. He then gives him the mysterious artefact that Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) was trying to work out what it was. Connor is then seen carrying Cutter's body out of the burning building and then after everyone realises he is dead he is seen crying and comforting a crying Abby. In episode 3.4 Connor was still distraught over his death, and set about creating a device to lock anomalies, and was worried when he heard Abby was hanging out with someone else. However it was only Abby's baby brother Jack (Robert Lowe), who was going to be staying at her flat, forcing him to move out for a while. He eventually moves in with James Lester (Ben Miller) after a short time staying in the ARC. In episode 3.6, he and Sarah Page (Laila Rouass) get the artefact to open for a short while, revealing that it predicted anomalies and that Cutter had been right about its importance, and did his best to keep it safe when the team was hiding from Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) and a flock of terror birds. At the end of episode 3.8, Abby kisses Connor after she finds out from Jack, that Connor got Rex back after Jack lost him in a game of poker which he did as he didn't want to hurt Abby when she was already distraught. In episode 3.9, they agree to try to not make things weird between them, and realised Helen had invaded the ARC with Sarah. In the Series 3 finale he, Abby and Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) go in pursuit of Helen and he discovers that Helen will be the cause of Site 333, the location of the First Family, a group of thirteen homonids who all died mysteriously at once, from Helen poisoning them. Connor was injured while fighting a pack of raptors in the Cretaceous, and Abby stays with him in the while Danny pursues Helen. They are last seen hiding in a tree as night falls, talking about going home.", "Captain Wilder, played by Alex McSweeney, is Christine Johnson's (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) head of security in Series 3. He takes an active role in several episodes and is Christine's choice to succeed Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) as leader of the anomaly response team, as part of her plot to seize control of the ARC from James Lester (Ben Miller). This fails, and Lester appoints Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) instead. It is also revealed that Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) from the ARC knew Wilder at Sandhurst. Later Wilder is recognised by Danny at a distance, leading to the discovery that Wilder and Christine have captured Eve (Kate Magowan) - actually the disguised Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) - from the future. In episode 3.9 he points his gun at Helen who threatens to kill Christine if the artefact is not given to her."]}, {"page": "The Peter Serafinowicz Show", "response": ["In addition to Serafinowicz, recurring cast members included Belinda Stewart-Wilson, Catherine Shepherd, Paul Putner, Alex Lowe, Bronagh Gallagher, Sarah Alexander and Benedict Wong.
