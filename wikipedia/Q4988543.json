However, before The Further Adventures could be published the manuscript was badly damaged in an accidental fire at her parents' home in 1941 in which she lost nearly all her possessions. By 1950 some of the chapters had been deciphered and were published in Collins Magazine, but Garnett then abandoned the work of recovering the rest of the manuscript. Eventually she deciphered most of the burned pages. That part of the manuscript which remained completely legible had already been published in Junior Bookshelf magazine. The two elements were combined and Heinemann published the book in hardback in 1956. Its setting is the late 1930s; earlier than its publication date.
