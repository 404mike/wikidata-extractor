His themes included boys bathing, sunbathing, posing with pansies and possibly boy prostitutes on a \"Saturday afternoon\" in Artwork (1924, I, p.\u00a075). He is one of the few modernist artists to use abstraction to express the essentials of male beauty in simplified forms like his painting of \"Ganymede\" or by contrasts of black and white as in \"Drawing\" (1922). As Candela has speculated, he may also be the creator of the photomontages that he published in Ray (pp.\u00a02, 15 and 27), as by the otherwise unknown P. Capeli. His work as a pioneer of British modernism and as an abstract gay artist deserves much more reassessment."]}, {"page": "Chubb (surname)", "response": ["*Ralph Chubb (1892\u20131960), British poet"]}, {"page": "List of people from St Albans", "response": ["* Ralph Chubb (1892\u20131960), lithographer"]}]}}
