John Behr characterizes Eastern Orthodox theology as having been \"reborn in the twentieth century.\" Norman Russell describes Eastern Orthodox theology as having been dominated by an \"arid scholasticism\" for several centuries after the fall of Constantinople. Russell describes the postwar re-engagement of modern Greek theologians with the Greek Fathers, which occurred with the help of diaspora theologians and Western patristic scholars. A significant component of this re-engagement with the Greek Fathers has been a rediscovery of Palamas by Greek theologians; Palamas had previously been given less attention than the other Fathers."]}, {"page": "Norman Atkinson Russell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Norman Russell"]}]}}
