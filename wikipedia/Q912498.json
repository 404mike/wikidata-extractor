In 1994, Laws became player-manager of Grimsby Town before taking a similar position with Scunthorpe United in 1997. For the next nine years, Laws served as manager of Scunthorpe, guiding them to promotion twice. In 2006, he accepted the managerial role at Sheffield Wednesday, lasting three years in the job during which time Burnley approached him for their managers job when Steve Cotterill left, but were put off by the compensation demanded by Wednesday. Wednesday later struggled with financial problems and he was dismissed in December 2009 after a poor run of results.\nAfter only a brief spell out of the game, Burnley appointed Laws as their manager, giving him his first chance to manage in the Premier League after Owen Coyle left the club for Bolton in January 2010 and took the entire management team with him. He was dismissed by the club in December that year.

Under the management of former Burnley player Brian Miller, they returned to the second tier as champions in 1981\u201382. However, this return was short-lived and lasted only one year. Managerial changes continued to be made in a search for success; Miller was replaced by Frank Casper in early 1983, he by John Bond before the 1983\u201384 season and Bond himself by John Benson a season later.Simpson (2007), pp. 550\u2013554 Bond was the first manager since Frank Hill (1948\u20131954) without a previous playing career at the club.

The team avoided relegation to the Football Conference, the highest level of non-League football, on the last day in 1986\u201387, after they won against Orient and their rivals drew or lost.

Laws was dismissed in December 2010 and replaced by Eddie Howe, who was succeeded by Sean Dyche in October 2012.

The side stayed up this time; the 2016\u201317 season ended with them in 16th place. The club completed construction of Barnfield Training Centre that season, which replaced Gawthorpe. Dyche was involved in the training ground's design and had willingly tailored his transfer budget as both he and the board focused on the club's infrastructure and future. Burnley finished seventh in 2017\u201318, which meant qualification for the 2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League and a return to European football after 51 years.
