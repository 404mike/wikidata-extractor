At that time that the field of child and developmental psychology was still in its infancy. One of the first documented systematic observations of children dates back to 1840 when Charles Darwin started to observe and note down the growth and development of his own children. This way of scientifically documenting the behaviour of children was in turn what inspired many European developmental psychologists. The birth of developmental psychology itself is often set to 1882. In that year, William Thierry Preyer published the first textbook on the development of children titled \"the mind of the child\". One of his successors is the German psychologist William Stern who contributed further to the newly formed discipline with his systematic observations on children."]}]}}
