Peter Wright, a film historian and lecturer at the University of Liverpool, believes that the \"atmospheric\" cave sequences and the mess hall scene preceding Ricky's madness may have been inspired by Ridley Scott's film, comparing the former to the sequences set on the desolate planetoid and the latter to the violent reveal of the alien \"chestburster\". Wright considers the Alien connection potentially \"exploitative\"; to Barry Langford of the University of London, it underlines UK cinema's dependence on its US counterpart. Alan Jones argues that \"any similarity between Inseminoid and Alien is totally intentional. Except here is the basic idea contained in Alien taken to its sleaziest extreme.\" He finds one such parallel in the character of Kate (Stephanie Beacham), whom he likens to Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). However, he also regards Contamination (1980) and Scared to Death (1981) as less effective imitations of Scott. Edward Jones argues that the plot of Inseminoid also borrows from the novel Dracula (1897), the TV series The Bionic Woman (1976\u201378) and the films The Thing from Another World (1951) and Night of the Living Dead (1968)."]}, {"page": "Assi Dayan", "response": ["He was married and divorced four times and had four children.
