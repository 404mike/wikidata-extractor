He also played with early incarnations of The Smiths and The Stone Roses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Fall (band)", "response": ["The Fall were an English post-punk group, formed in 1976 in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. They underwent many line-up changes, with vocalist and founder Mark E. Smith as the only constant member. The Fall's long-term musicians included drummers Paul Hanley, Simon Wolstencroft and Karl Burns; guitarists Marc Riley, Craig Scanlon and Brix Smith; and bassist Steve Hanley, whose melodic, circular bass lines are widely credited with shaping the band's sound from early 1980s albums such as Hex Enduction Hour to the late 1990s.", "This era, a favourite period amongst many critics and fans, was marked by Brix's effort to find a wider audience for the Fall. They achieved a few modest UK hits with singles, including their versions of R. Dean Taylor's \"There's a Ghost in My House\" (no. 30, 1987) and the Kinks' \"Victoria\" (no. 35, 1988) and their own songs \"Hey! Luciani\" (no. 59, 1986) and \"Hit the North\" (no. 57, 1987), and enjoyed a string of critically acclaimed albums: The Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall (1984), This Nation's Saving Grace (1985), Bend Sinister (1986), and The Frenz Experiment (1988). I Am Kurious, Oranj is notable as the fruit of a ballet project between Smith and dancer Michael Clark. Simon Rogers and later Marcia Schofield played keyboards. Paul Hanley quit during the tour supporting The Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall, and Simon Wolstencroft replaced other drummer Burns after This Nation's Saving Grace. Wolstencroft becoming sole drummer shifted the group's sound; his drumming was described as \"nimble\" and \"funky\" when compared to Burns. In 2014 Wolstencroft published a memoir You Can Drum But You Can't Hide about his 11-year stint in the Fall.", "In 1994 and 1996, the Fall played at the Phoenix Festival in Stratford-upon-Avon, England \u2013 the 1996 appearance being one of much surprise to many fans as they were not scheduled to play. The next album, Levitate (1997), toyed with drum and bass and polarised opinion (long-serving drummer Simon Wolstencroft left halfway through the recording sessions, and was replaced \u2013 again \u2013 by Karl Burns). Steven Wells in the NME (11 October 1997) wrote, \"Imagine pop without perimeters. Imagine rock without rules. Imagine art without the wank. If you've never heard the Fall then Levitate will be either the best or the worst record you've ever heard.\" The group was temporarily reduced to Smith and Nagle when a short US tour ended in April 1998 with onstage rows in New York, which resulted in Smith unplugging the amps during songs and lashing out at the other members, leading Burns to physically shove him. This led to the departure of Hanley (bassist of nineteen years), Burns, and guitarist Tommy Crooks. The following day, Smith was arrested and charged with assaulting Nagle in their hotel. Despite this, Nagle remained with the band. The Smith and Nagle line-up would release two albums: The Marshall Suite (1999) and The Unutterable (2000)."]}, {"page": "The Stone Roses", "response": ["Ian Brown (at the time the bassist) and guitarist John Squire, who knew each other from Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, formed a short-lived Clash-inspired band called The Patrol in 1980 along with singer/guitarist Andy Couzens and drummer Simon Wolstencroft.Robb, p. 40Taylor (2004) They played several gigs in 1980 and recorded a demo tape, but towards the end of that year decided on a change of direction.Robb, p. 46 Brown had got a taste of being a frontman during the last Patrol show, singing Sweet's \"Block Buster!\" to close the set, with the band's friend/roadie Pete Garner standing in on bass, and Couzens wanting to concentrate on guitar.

Robert Christgau gave it a three-star \"honorable mention\", with the comment \"great original sound, one hell of a cover band\".
