United won the league championship but were denied the 20th century's first \"double\" when they controversially lost the 1957 FA Cup Final to Aston Villa. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper Ray Wood carried off with a broken cheekbone after a clash with Villa centre forward Peter McParland. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate Jackie Blanchflower who ended up between the posts."]}, {"page": "Belfast", "response": ["* Jackie Blanchflower, football player"]}, {"page": "September 2", "response": ["*1998 \u2013 Jackie Blanchflower, Northern Irish footballer (b. 1933)"]}, {"page": "1998", "response": ["** Jackie Blanchflower, Northern Irish footballer (b. 1933)"]}, {"page": "1933", "response": ["* March 7 \u2013 Jackie Blanchflower, Northern Irish footballer (d. 1998)"]}, {"page": "Munich air disaster", "response": ["*Jackie Blanchflower (never played again, died 1998)", "Twenty people, including seven of Manchester United's players, died at the scene of the crash. The 21st victim was Frank Swift, a journalist and former goalkeeper who played with Busby at Manchester City; he died on his way to hospital. Duncan Edwards died from his injuries on 21 February at the Rechts der Isar Hospital in Munich, and the final death toll reached 23 several days later when co-pilot Ken Rayment died as a result of serious head injuries. Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower were both injured so severely that they never played again.Hall, p. 340. Matt Busby was seriously injured and had to stay in hospital for more than two months after the crash, and was given the Last Rites twice.Barnes et al., p. 17. After being discharged from hospital, he went to Switzerland to recuperate in Interlaken. At times, he felt like giving up football entirely, until he was told by his wife, Jean, \"You know Matt, the lads would have wanted you to carry on.\"Morrin, p. 155. That statement lifted Busby from his depression, and he returned by land and sea to Manchester, before watching his team play in the 1958 FA Cup Final.", "Martin Edwards was criticised for turning the match into a publicity stunt, while Elizabeth Wood, the divorced wife of Munich survivor Ray Wood, compared the treatment of the Munich victims to that of \"dancing bears at the circus\". Nevertheless, the match earned \u00a347,000 for each of the victims' families, while Eric Cantona recouped over \u00a390,000 in expenses directly from the testimonial fund, rather than from the club.Morrin, p. 205. The club has also received criticism from some quarters for its poor treatment of the survivors: Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower were forced to leave the flats they rented from the club to make way for new players. Berry was also notified by post that his employment with the club had been terminated. Another survivor, goalkeeper Ray Wood, complained about the lack of recognition from the club: \"We feel that we helped to build Manchester United... They received massive international support following the disaster but they didn't treat people properly then, did nothing for us all those years, and they're still making money out of it directly now.\""]}, {"page": "Duncan Edwards", "response": ["Edwards began his Manchester United career in the youth team and made several appearances for the team that won the first ever FA Youth Cup in 1953,Horne et al., p. 225. but by the time of the final had already made his debut for the first team. On 4 April 1953 he played in a Football League First Division match against Cardiff City, which United lost 4\u20131, aged just 16 years and 185 days, making him the youngest player ever to play in the top flight of English football. Mindful of the fact that his team contained a large number of relatively old players, Busby was keen to bring new young players through the ranks; and Edwards, along with the likes of Dennis Viollet and Jackie Blanchflower, was among a number of youngsters introduced to the team during 1953, who came to be known collectively as the Busby Babes. Reviewing his performance on his first-team debut the Manchester Guardian newspaper commented that \"he showed promise of fine ability in passing and shooting, but will have to move faster as a wing half\".McCartney, p. 22."]}, {"page": "Matt Busby", "response": ["By 1952, however, the side captained by Johnny Carey, was beginning to show its age, and a new set of players had to be found. Busby, who had achieved a great deal of success in spite of his lack of previous managerial experience, was expected to spend large sums of money on high-profile players. Instead, he gradually replaced the older players with players as young as 16 and 17. These included right-back Bill Foulkes, centre-halves Mark Jones and Jackie Blanchflower, wingers Albert Scanlon and David Pegg and forward Billy Whelan. Among them was Duncan Edwards, judged by many to be England's finest player of his era, and capped by England at 17 \u2013 setting a record for the youngest-ever full international that remained unbroken for more than 40 years. He made relatively few signings from other clubs between 1951 and 1957, rare examples being winger Johnny Berry, forward Tommy Taylor and goalkeeper Harry Gregg."]}, {"page": "Mark Jones (footballer, born 1933)", "response": ["Jones signed for Manchester United as an apprentice on leaving school in 1948, and also worked an apprentice bricklayer for a while afterwards, and made his first two senior appearances for United in the 1950\u201351 season, aged 17, and by the time of United's title glory in 1955\u201356 he was a regular first team player, although he often found himself out of the team in favour of Jackie Blanchflower (who was originally a wing-half or an inside-forward), having previously been understudy to the veteran Allenby Chilton. By the time United won the league title in 1956, he was a regular member of the first team, and collected another league title medal the following year."]}, {"page": "Bill Foulkes", "response": ["The 23 survivors were admitted to hospital, but Foulkes was discharged and spent the night in a hotel with Gregg. The next morning, Foulkes visited his teammates in the hospital. He visited Duncan Edwards, Johnny Berry, Jackie Blanchflower, Viollet, Scanlon, Charlton and Ray Wood. Then, he recalls, \"I was just beginning to think it didn't look too bad when I asked where the rest were. The nurse simply shook her head and said: 'That's it, everybody else has died.'\"", "On 10 October 1960, Busby played Foulkes at centre-half for the first time, having experimented with a string of players to fill the position after the crash had claimed the life of Mark Jones and ended the playing career of Jackie Blanchflower more than two years previously. Centre-half would prove to be his favoured position over the rest of his playing career, but he did not start to enjoy the game again until 1963. In the 1963\u201364 season, United finished second in the league, and finally won the Championship in the 1964\u201365 season, after a run of 13 wins in 15 games. By then, Foulkes and Charlton were the only two Munich survivors in the team. In 1966\u201367, Foulkes helped United win the Championship again, completing his haul of four Championship medals, more than any other United player of his era, and indeed any other player at the club for the next 32 years."]}, {"page": "Harry Gregg", "response": ["He is sometimes referred to as \"The Hero of Munich\" for his actions in the aftermath of the Munich air disaster, pulling his teammates \u2013 including Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and Dennis Viollet \u2013 from the burning plane.

In the sixth minute of the game Wood successfully claimed a cross; however, Villa outside-left Peter McParland clattered into him, breaking Wood's jaw due to him ducking to avoid the challenge. As this game was played in the era before substitutes Jackie Blanchflower was forced to play in goal following the incident, Wood eventually came back on after treatment to play as a forward, United went on to lose the game 2\u20131.

(2001), p. 12 When Busby took over in 1945 he overhauled the team; seven players were transfer listed, several changed positions and signed Jimmy Delaney from Celtic. These changes resulted in the club finishing the 1946\u201347 season as runners up in the First Division, and in 1948 the club won the FA Cup, beating Blackpool 4\u20132 in the final. At the start of the following season, Busby began selling some of the older players and replacing them with players from the Youth and Reserve teams. The term the 'Busby Babes' was coined in November 1951, after 18-year-old Jackie Blanchflower and 22-year-old Roger Byrne made their debuts against Liverpool at Anfield; Tom Jackson of the Manchester Evening News described them in a match report as 'United's Babes'.Barnes et al.
