Variety praised the film's acting and directing but stated that its \"theatrical prospects seem iffy.\" The cinematography of the film was praised by some critics. Sight & Sound magazine wrote that \"Andrew Piddington approaches his material in a resourceful way.\" Richard Schickel, the film critic for Time, reportedly approved of the film when he first viewed it, but several years later described it as \"a bit on the plodding side\" and as \"the kind of film that would have two weeks in the theater and then go straight to video.\" The New York Times considered the film to be a disaster, writing: \"Shuttlecock\" is a film for which things went very wrong. So wrong, in fact, that it makes a kind of negative case study for anyone thinking of investing in or producing an independent film. Its troubled history is a whole-earth catalogue of bad decisions, strategic miscalculations, painful rejections, misunderstandings and lots of old-fashioned bad luck. It is the film story that independent producers pray they will never live through. However, when the film was screened on 6 January 1994 on Channel 4 as part of its series \"Film on Four\", the Sunday Telegraph named the film its \"TV Pick of the Week,\" referring to it as \"a film with things to say and a muscular yet sensitive way of saying them.\""]}, {"page": "Piddington, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Piddington"]}, {"page": "Piddington (surname)", "response": ["* Andrew Piddington (born 1949), English film director"]}, {"page": "British Independent Film Award \u2013 The Douglas Hickox Award", "response": ["| Andrew Piddington"]}]}}
