Participants were given paper hearts on which they were asked to write what they loved about their body; they then displayed the hearts simultaneously at 1 p.m. Ruth Rogers said of the event: \"Too many people don't have anything that they love about their bodies, and we thought we should try to encourage them to really look at themselves and go 'you're gorgeous'. We're bombarded every single day with negative imagery and unattainable perfection. No matter what you feel that you should look like, you look like you, and you can be the best version of you.

At the 2013 International Dance Music Awards, the video was nominated in the categories of Best Dance Music Video and Best Pop Music Video, but failed to win either of them. Shortly after \"Girl Gone Wild\"s release to YouTube on March 21, 2012, the video was rated by many viewers as inappropriate. This caused YouTube to set an age restriction, only allowing those of age 18 or older to view the video. According to the website, the video was labeled explicit because of the \"raunchy\" and \"orgy\" scenes, thereby blocking it from getting uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. YouTube also asked Madonna's representative to upload a more PG-rated version. Madonna later commented, \"What's wrong with... what grinding? I'm supposed to be a 'girl gone wild' in the video\u2014how can I go wild and not grind? This is the question that people should be asking.\" During her interview with Jimmy Fallon on Facebook, Madonna jokingly confessed that if she were president, \"There would be no restrictions whatsoever on any of my videos, ever\". Jane Martinson of The Guardian expressed her disappointment with the ban, since she felt there were far more provocative content in YouTube than Madonna's video. Martinson also noted that the semi-nudity in question came from the men featured in the clip, and felt that Madonna had turned Francis' concept of girls going wild, to \"[girls who] can also be the ones in control. I watched the video ready to slate her and came away thinking, after 30 years Madonna can still show Rihanna how sex and music can subvert expectations.\""]}, {"page": "George Green's School", "response": ["* Jane Martinson, journalist on The Guardian"]}, {"page": "Causes of the vote in favour of Brexit", "response": ["The Guardian journalist Jane Martinson noted that many of the UK's biggest selling newspapers, The Sun and the Daily Mail in particular, but also including The Daily Telegraph and Daily Express, have been Eurosceptic for many years.
