He started his career in the music business in 1974, as an apprentice at Morgan Studios in London, one of the major independent recording studios in the UK at the time. Initially, he worked there as a tape operator and his first job as sound engineer was on Judas Priest's second album Sad Wings of Destiny in 1976. He engineered the British hit single \"Naughty Naughty Naughty\" in 1977, a pop song by Joy Sarney, whose success gave him much more work as engineer at the studio. In that period he engineered and mixed albums of new wave acts, such as Japan's Obscure Alternatives (1978), and jazz fusion releases of Colosseum II and Brand X. Tsangarides befriended Colosseum II guitarist Gary Moore, who requested him for his solo album Back on the Streets (1978) and gave him his first job as producer. The song \"Parisienne Walkways\", sung by Phil Lynott and contained in the album, was a hit in the UK. Tsangarides continued working with Moore on live albums and produced Back to the Blues in 2001."]}, {"page": "List of performances on Top of the Pops", "response": ["* Joy Sarney \u2013 \"Naughty Naughty Naughty\""]}, {"page": "Mickey Jupp", "response": ["At one time the Mickey Jupp Band had Joy Sarney as its vocalist."]}]}}
