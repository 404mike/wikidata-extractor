On 27 January 2021, he played and scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 Premiership win over Hibernian at Easter Road. His performance proved controversial due to an off the ball incident where he appeared to stamp on Hibernian player Ryan Porteous, and was subsequently given a three match ban. On 21 February, he scored a bizarre goal during a league match against Dundee United as a clearance from United's goalkeeper Benjamin Siegrist rebounded off Morelos's body into the goal. He followed this up four days later with a goal in the Europa League Round of 32 match against Royal Antwerp. On 21 March, he scored his first goal in the Old Firm derby during a 1\u20131 draw away at Celtic Park; later reports emerged that he was the subject of racial abuse over social media perpetrated by alleged opposition fans. With three goals in three appearances, Morelos ended March 2021 by being named Scottish Premiership Player of the Month. On 2 May, Morelos scored against Celtic again in a 4\u20131 win at Ibrox, which was a biggest margin of victory against their rivals in 14 years and ensured that Rangers stayed unbeaten against Celtic in all league matches for the first time since the 1999\u20132000 season.
