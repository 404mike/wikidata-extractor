William succeeded his father in 1861. \nWilliam was the grandson of Daniel Beat Christin, a Swiss of obscure origins who anglicised his surname to Christie on entering the service of the East India Company and who retired to England in the 1780s having made a sudden fortune and an advantageous marriage to the daughter of Sir Purbeck Langham which brought Glyndebourne into the Christin/Christie family.During the 1870s William made substantial alterations to Glyndebourne, adding a brick extension, ornate stonework and balustrading. In 1876 he engaged architect Ewan Christian to install bay windows and add decorative brickwork to give the house its current Jacobean appearance.He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lewes at the 1874 general election, having unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1865 and 1868. He was the first Conservative MP to represent Lewes in the House of Commons since Henry Fitzroy had died in 1860. Christie was re-elected in 1880, and retired from Parliament at the 1885 general election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Christie", "response": ["William Christie may refer to:", "* William Christie (Unitarian) (1748\u20131823), Scottish Unitarian writer", "* William Christie (dean of Moray, Ross and Caithness) (1816\u20131885), Scots Episcopal priest and first dean of the United Diocese", "* William Christie (Conservative politician) (1830\u20131913), British Member of Parliament for Lewes, 1874\u20131885", "* William Christie (astronomer) (1845\u20131922), British astronomer", "* William Christie (dean of Brechin) (fl. 1882\u20131931), Scots Episcopal priest and son of the above Dean of Moray", "* William Christie (Ulster politician) (1913\u20132008), British politician", "* William Christie (musician) (born 1944), American conductor and harpsichordist"]}, {"page": "Lewes (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Christie || Conservative"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Christie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1874 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Christie"]}, {"page": "Christie (surname)", "response": ["* William Christie (disambiguation), multiple people, including:", "** William Christie (musician) (born 1944), American musician", "** William Christie (astronomer) (1845\u20131922), English astronomer", "** William Christie (Ulster politician) (1913\u20132008), Irish politician", "** William Christie (Missionary) (1870-04-28 1955-01-11), In 1888 immigrated from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland to New York City, USA.
