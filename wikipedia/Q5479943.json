Francis Aglionby (born Yates; 12 May 1777 \u2013 1 July 1840) was an English Whig politician.Aglionby was born at Skirwith Abbey, Cumberland, the eldest son of John Ofeur Yates, and Mary Aglionby. In 1822, he assumed the Aglionby surname in order to inherit from his maternal aunt.He was educated at Rugby School. He earned his B.A. from Cambridge in 1799 and in November that year was admitted to the bar at Gray's Inn. However, instead of pursuing a career in law, he accepted a commission in the Royal Cumberland Militia, where he rose to the rank of Major. He served as chairman of the county's quarter sessions from 1818 until his death.Aglionby stood for election to Parliament in Cumberland Western at a by-election in 1833 and again at the 1835 general election, but without success. He won a seat at the 1837 general election, when he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for  Cumberland Eastern, and held the seat until his sudden death in 1840 while entering the courthouse in Carlisle.In 1814, he married Mary Matthews, daughter of J. M. Matthews, of Wigton Hall. They had three daughters and one son. He was buried at Ainstable, Cumberland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["Graham's conduct in Parliament alienated many of his traditional Whig supporters. In 1837, upon the death of William IV and the announcement of a general election, a requisition signed by over 2,500 county freeholders sought the election of two alternative Whig candidates. On the day of the election, freeholders flocked from every part of the division to offer support for the reform candidates. The cavalcade of horsemen, four abreast, many of whom had ridden many miles that morning, stretched over half a mile. Flags and banner, advertising the disapproval of Graham, flew profusely, many of them bearing skits relating to Graham's past conduct. On the hustings, Graham found it difficult to obtain a hearing, and in consequence he submitted to his opponents' cries. At the close of the poll the numbers were: for Francis Aglionby 2,294; for William James 2,124; for Graham 1,505. This ended Graham's influence in his home county."]}, {"page": "Musgrave Watson", "response": ["*Marble statues of Major Francis Aglionby, MP for East Cumberland, (1843)  and Lord Lonsdale (1845) in Carlisle."]}, {"page": "East Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Francis Aglionby || Radical"]}, {"page": "Henry Aglionby Aglionby", "response": ["In 1840, he inherited the rest of the Aglionby estates, including Nunnery, Cumberland, upon the death of his first cousin Francis Aglionby (formerly Yates).
