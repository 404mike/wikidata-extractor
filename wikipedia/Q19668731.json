However, he kept on fighting and was able to make a living outside of boxing for a while when he appeared in a play called \"Black against White\". An actress called Mabel Goldswain appeared with him in this vaudeville play, along with British lightweight champion Jack Goldswain.

With titles coming under the jurisdiction of the National Sporting Club, Joseph won his first regulated title in October 1908, beating Corporal Bill Baker to take the English welterweight title (later known as the British welterweight title). He took a 20-round points decision over Young Otto in April 1909, claiming the 142\u00a0lbs world title. He successfully defended his British title against Jack Goldswain in March 1910. In June 1910 he fought Harry Lewis in Whitechapel in a fight that was billed as a world welterweight title fight; Lewis stopped Joseph in the 7th round.Blady, Ken (1990) Jewish Boxers' Hall of Fame, Specialist Press International, "]}]}}
