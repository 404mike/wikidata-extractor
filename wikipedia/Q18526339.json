Once called \"the greatest inspired painter since William Blake\",Tit-Bits, 22 October 1932. Henry Stockley was arguably the most important primitive artists active in the period 1930 to 1960. Alan Clutton-Brock, art critic of The Times, was particularly impressed by his handling of figures and his ability \"to give its proper atmosphere to a landscape and keep a number of curious and unexpected colours in harmony with each other\".Alan Clutton, The Times, 4 October 1932. Stockley's work suffered years of neglect partially reversed with the publication of a number of articles on his life and artistic production and with a major exhibition devoted to his life and art at the London Transport Museum (July 1996 to March 1997). The location is significant. Although trained as a meat inspector, for many years Henry Stockley was a bus driver.", "She continued to show Stockley's work in London, Sussex, Manchester, at her gallery in Derbyshire. His work was frequently shown alongside Alfred Wallace and Christopher Wood, but never sold well. It did however receive some critical acclaim.  Alan Clutton-Brock, art critic for The Times, reviewed Stockley's work sympathetically in 1932, writing of his use of 'curious and unexpected colours' 'working in harmony to create atmosphere in a landscape', his 'curiously expressive' drawing especially of the human figure, and his originality of invention. The same critic wrote in 1934 of Stockley's 'dramatic and highly original forms'. A Daily Sketch writer compared him with Blake, an association that stayed with him for a number of years. A painting, Evelyn Laye in Hyde Park was shown in The Listener in that same year and this work is now in the Towner Gallery, Eastbourne, and was last exhibited in a travelling show in 1992. The press, with exceptions like the Times, and later the Daily Worker, generally treated Stockley's work either as simple-minded or as yet another deplorable example of the stupidity of 'modern art'. Stockley was deeply hurt by this hostility, especially by a Sunday Times review of 1932 which failed to find any positive qualities and talks of an \"evident lack of technical ability\" and  \"unsophisticated imaginings.\"  In 1938 Stockley's work was shown at the now-famous exhibition of Unprofessional Painting at the Bensham Grove Settlement, Gateshead-On-Tyne alongside the Ashington Group, the so-called Pitmen Painters, which attracted the interest of a number of leading left wing intellectuals of the 1930s [Feaver, 1985:77\u201379].
