His performance in that match persuaded Accrington Stanley manager John Coleman to sign Evans in October 2011, on a one-month youth loan deal with the Football League Two club. Evans scored five minutes into his Accrington Stanley debut, a 2\u20131 win over Bristol Rovers at the Crown Ground, playing ninety minutes on 5 November 2011. His second goal for the club came on 3 December 2011, in a 1\u20131 draw away at Hereford United, levelling from close range. Halfway through December after making four appearances for Accrington Stanley, his loan was extended until the end of the season. He scored again three days later with a tap in against Macclesfield Town in a 4\u20130 home win. His final appearance for Accrington came on the final game of the season, a 1\u20130 defeat to Crawley Town, replacing Marcus Carver in the second half. Despite his form slumped towards the end of the season, Evans made a total of 23 appearances for Accrington scoring three goals."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Accrington Stanley F.C. season", "response": ["|18||Marcus Carver||||Blackburn||||CF||15||1||1 June 2012||Academy||Trainee||30 June 2014", "|18||FW||Marcus Carver||0||0||1||0||1"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Accrington Stanley F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Marcus Carver"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Accrington Stanley F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2016 || CF ||  || Marcus Carver || Chorley || Free transfer || "]}]}}
