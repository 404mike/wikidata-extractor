After completing his National Service, he signed for Hibernian in 1955. He made his debut for Hibs in a match against Falkirk, playing in a pair of boots borrowed from Gordon Smith. Aitken became a key player in the Hibs team over the next few years, including their run to the 1958 Scottish Cup Final. Aitken's injury early in that match badly affected Hibs' chances, as substitutes were not yet allowed.\nAitken moved to West Bromwich Albion in September 1959, but was hindered by injury during his time with the Midlands club. He returned to Scotland with Falkirk, and helped them gain promotion to Scottish League Division One. He then moved on to Raith Rovers, helping them reach a Scottish Cup semi-final. Aitken also played for Gala Fairydean before retiring from the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andrew Aitken", "response": ["Andrew or Andy Aitken may refer to:", "*Andy Aitken (footballer, born 1877) (1877\u20131955), Scottish footballer for Newcastle United, Middlesbrough, Scotland ", "*Andy Aitken (footballer, born 1919) (1919\u20132000), Scottish footballer", "*Andy Aitken (footballer, born 1934) (1934\u20132005), Scottish footballer", "*Andy Aitken (footballer, born 1978), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Andy Aitken (footballer born 1934)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Aitken (footballer, born 1934)"]}]}}
