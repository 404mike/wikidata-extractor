Arthur Wharton was previously commonly thought to be the first black player, as he was the first black professional footballer to play in the Football League, but Watson's career predated him by over a decade. There is evidence that Watson was paid professionally when at Bootle F.C. in 1887, two years prior to Wharton becoming a professional with Rotherham Town F.C.; however, the Merseyside club did not play in the Football League at the time Watson played there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Andrew Watson (born 1857), world's first black international football player, captain and administrator"]}, {"page": "1881", "response": ["* March 12 \u2013 Andrew Watson makes his Scotland debut, as the world's first black international football player."]}, {"page": "Kew", "response": ["* Andrew Watson (1856\u20131921), the world's first black person to play association football at international level, retired to London in around 1910 and died of pneumonia at 88 Forest Road in 1921.
