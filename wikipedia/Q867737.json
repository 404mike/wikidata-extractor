She was also the former front-woman of Manchester based post-punk outfit 'Ludus'.For her solo shows at the Hepworth Wakefield and Tate St Ives in 2013, Sterling collaborated with choreographer Kenneth Tindall of Northern Ballet for a performance piece, The Ultimate Form (2013), inspired by the artist's research into the work of Barbara Hepworth.Recent solo exhibitions include Nottingham Contemporary, Kestnergesellschaft, Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de Paris, and Museum of Modern Art PS1, and Sterling's work has been included in group exhibitions at Tate Modern, Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Tate Britain, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. In 2017, Sterling was awarded the Paul Hamlyn Foundation Award. She is represented by Stuart Shave/Modern Art, London and Blum & Poe, Los Angeles.In one of her early works, the cover art for the 1977 single release of \"Orgasm Addict\" by the Buzzcocks, the collage depicts a naked woman with an iron for a head and grinning mouths instead of nipples. \"At this point, men's magazines were either DIY, cars or porn. Women's magazines were fashion or domestic stuff. So, guess the common denominator \u2013 the female body.
