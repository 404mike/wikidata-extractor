The great majority of the scorers of a hat-trick have played for the winning side, but there have also been a few occasions when the player's team have drawn or lost the game.Cristiano Ronaldo became the first to reach 10 international hat-tricks on 12 October 2021, and has scored 58 overall, more than any active player. According to Guinness World Records Pel\u00e9 has scored the most hat-tricks in history, however based on RSSSF's data the record belongs to Erwin Helmchen with at least 141. Pel\u00e9 still holds the record for the youngest player to strike three times in a FIFA World Cup match after achieving the feat in 1958, while Ntinos Pontikas became the youngest ever to score a hat-trick in 1996. Stjepan Lucijanic broke Masashi Nakayama's record with the most conscecutive hat-tricks in 2016, just over a century after Sophus Nielsen scored 10 goals in a single match of the Olympic tournament which still remains a record. When it comes to continental competitions Michel Platini is the only player who scored two hat-tricks in the UEFA European Championship, but there have been ten players who managed to achieve the same feat in the Copa America: Ademir, Javier Ambrois, David Arellano, Teodoro Fernandez, Herminio Masantonio, Pedro Petrone, Sylvio Pirillo, Jose Sanfilippo, Severino Varela, and Paolo Guerrero.
