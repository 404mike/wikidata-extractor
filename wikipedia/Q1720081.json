England led by 6 points with 3 minutes left to play and appeared to have won the game, but in one of the last plays of the match, Gibbs received a Scott Quinnell pass 20m from the try line and proceeded to 'sidestep' one player for one of the most celebrated tries in Welsh history. (In a 2013 article for The Guardian, Gibbs said that the play was inspired by a move that his old St Helens teammate Bobbie Goulding had regularly used to great success in the 13-man code, namely packing the midfield with forwards before allowing a back to cut through on a diagonal dummy run.)
