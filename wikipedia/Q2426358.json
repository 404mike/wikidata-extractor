Today he is known most of all for his travelogue of the Grand Tour, which was at that time popular particularly among English noblemen taking educational tours through Europe.   His detailed descriptions of the France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands of the time provide a rich source for historians of the situation in the second half of the 18th century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Duvet", "response": ["In the mid-18th century, Thomas Nugent, an Englishman on a grand tour then passing through Westphalia, observed with surprise:"]}, {"page": "The Spirit of the Laws", "response": ["The Spirit of Laws (French: De l'esprit des lois, originally spelled De l'esprit des loix) is a treatise on political theory, as well as a pioneering work in comparative law, published in 1748 by Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu. Originally published anonymously, partly because Montesquieu's works were subject to censorship, its influence outside France was aided by its rapid translation into other languages. In 1750 Thomas Nugent published the first English translation.Now best known as published in New York by Hafner Press in 1949, using Nugent's original version and with an introduction by Franz Neumann.  In 1751 the Roman Catholic Church added De l'esprit des lois to its Index Librorum Prohibitorum (\"List of Prohibited Books\"). Yet Montesquieu's treatise had an enormous influence on the work of many others, most notably: Catherine the Great, who produced Nakaz (Instruction); the Founding Fathers of the United States Constitution; and Alexis de Tocqueville, who applied Montesquieu's methods to a study of American society, in Democracy in America. Macaulay referenced Montesquieu's continuing importance when he wrote in his 1827 essay entitled \"Machiavelli\" that \"Montesquieu enjoys, perhaps, a wider celebrity than any political writer of modern Europe.\"", "* de Secondat, Charles, Baron de Montesquieu,  \"The Spirit of Laws\"  2 vols.
