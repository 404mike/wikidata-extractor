This process allowed increasing numbers of what might traditionally be classified as working-class people to assume the lifestyle and individualistic values of the so-called middle classes and hence reject commitment to collective social and economic goals. The opposite process is proletarianization. Sociologist John Goldthorpe disputed the embourgeoisement thesis in 1967."]}, {"page": "Cultural capital", "response": ["Some scholars such as John Goldthorpe dismiss Bourdieu's approach:"]}, {"page": "John H.
