Reid added Stevenage's fourth goal of the game when he poked the ball past the onrushing Kean. The goal was wrongly accredited as a Neal Trotman own goal, with there being \"conclusive proof\" that Reid made contact with the ball. The away side replied with their second of the match almost instantly, David Ball turning sharply before placing a shot that went in off of the post. A week later, Stevenage travelled to Oldham Athletic, earning a 1\u20131 draw.

Despite the visitors having a one-man advantage, it was Stevenage who doubled the lead, Mark Roberts heading in Robin Shroot's cross to score his fifth goal of the campaign.

Stevenage substitute Chuks Aneke was also sent-off in the second half for a high-footed challenge. In the week prior to Stevenage's trip to Rochdale, speculation mounted as to whether Stevenage manager Graham Westley would remain at the club amidst interest from fellow League One side, Preston North End. Westley eventually joined Preston on 13 January, leaving the club after three-and-a-half years in charge. Westley took his back-room staff with him to Preston, meaning captain Mark Roberts was named as player-manager for the club's trip to Spotland on 14 January. The game ended 5\u20131 to Stevenage. Luke Freeman, playing his first game since signing for the club on a permanent basis, scored the opening goal when his shot squirmed under Rochdale goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Kurucz.

Chesterfield doubled their advantage ten minutes later when Jordan Bowery capitalised a defensive mix-up to curl in a shot from the edge of the area.

Luke Freeman then doubled Stevenage's advantage ten minutes later, dispossessing Adam Thompson before cutting in and hitting a right-footed shot that crashed into the goal off the post. Saunders reduced the deficit in injury-time with a curling free-kick, although Stevenage held on to secure a vital victory. The third straight victory, coupled with Notts County's home loss to Bury, meant that Stevenage were back in the play-off places with just two games remaining.

With Wednesday yet to gain any points away from home this season, The Owls were happy with the eventual outcome of a 1\u20131 draw. Bradley Wright-Phillips scored from outside the box into the low corner in just the third minute, but Clinton Morrison earned the point when he equalised in the second half, three-minutes after coming on in the fifty-third minute. In the course of this game, Ryan Lowe made his debut for the club when coming off the bench, but then had to be replaced after an injury. Ryan Lowe did however win the League One Player of the Month award four days later, after scoring seven goals in the opening month of the season for his previous side Bury. The first home game of the month saw another tough opponent of Milton Keynes Dons who held first place in the league. After a poor performance in the first half, the game was goalless and Jermaine Johnson was replaced, as he had only been back in training after injury days earlier. Things changed in the second half with Gary Madine scoring twice in ten minutes, before Angelo Balanta pulled one back for Milton Keynes Dons. With Milton Keynes Dons pushing forward in the later stages of the game, Wednesday hit them on the counter-attack with 19-year-old Scotland U-21 international Liam Palmer scoring his first goal for the club. On 12 September The Owls were sad to hear that Wednesday-supporter and goalkeeper Nicky Weaver was to be 'sidelined for three months', due to an ongoing problem with the cartilage in his knee. This meant second-choice goalkeeper was expected to have an opportunity to impress in several matches on the bounce for Wednesday. His first appearance with the absence of Nicky Weaver however was one to forget. In the mid-week match away to Stevenage The Owls lost 5\u20131, after four goals in the first half from Craig Reid, John Mousinho, Michael Bostwick, and Lawrie Wilson. Then another to make it five in the second-half by Darius Charles, before Gary Madine scored nothing but a consolation goal in the seventy-fourth minute. Wednesday included their first sending-off of the campaign to make matters worse in the later stages of the game when Jermaine Johnson was sent-off for an off-the-ball incident. After this terrible defeat, Gary Megson felt the squad still needed some improvement, especially with the club having several injuries, including striker Ryan Lowe. Midway through the month David McGoldrick was brought in on a one-month loan, as the emergency-loan window was still open for football league clubs below the Barclays Premier League. David McGoldrick made his debut for Sheffield Wednesday that weekend, in which he started the game away to Yeovil Town. Ten-minutes into the game David McGoldrick scored on his debut to give Wednesday the lead. However, Yeovil Town striker Kieran Agard hit two goals before half-time and The Owls found themselves behind. Having been humiliated the previous away game, Wednesday went out in the second-half hoping to finish the game with a win. Wednesday did exactly that with goals from defender Julian Bennett on the fifty-first minute and twenty-minutes later top scorer Gary Madine scored the winning goal with the game finishing 2\u20133. Although manager Gary Megson felt goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell was up to the job at first, due to first-choice keeper Nicky Weaver out for three-months, Megson did bring in Stephen Bywater on loan from Derby County for three-months, as The Owls had let in seven goals in two games. With new signing Chris O'Grady coming back from injury that week, and Ryan Lowe soon to be back, striker Clinton Morrison was sent out on loan to Milton Keynes Dons for one-month on an emergency loan deal. The Owls back at home on 24 September they played Exeter City, James O'Connor scored the opener, and a double-brace from Gary Madine, including one from the penalty-spot, made the game finish 3\u20130."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Peterborough United F.C. season", "response": ["* 5 July - Stevenage rejects a joint \u00a31 million bid for Lawrie Wilson and Michael Bostwick."]}]}}
