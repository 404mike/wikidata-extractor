Following the abolition of slavery in 1886, the focus of Cuban literature shifted to themes of independence and freedom as exemplified by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, who led the modernista movement in Latin American literature. The poet Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n's famous Motivos del son focused on the interplay between races.
