As a member of the pan-African and repatriation movements, Christian traveled worldwide to help preserve the African languages, traditions, and heritage of the diaspora and encouraged study on the history and culture of Caribbean communities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Music of Anguilla", "response": ["The music of Anguilla is part of the Lesser Antillean music area. The earliest people of the island were the Caribs and Arawaks, who arrived from South America. English settlers from St Kitts and Irish people later colonized the island. Unlike regional neighbors, however, the plantation system of agriculture that relied on chattel slavery never took root in Anguilla, causing a distinctly independent cultural makeup. The most recent influences on Anguilla's musical life come from elsewhere in the Caribbean, especially the music of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica, as well as abroad, especially the music of the United States and the United Kingdom. Anguilla's Rastafarian heritage has played a role in the island's music and culture and produced influential figures like activist Ijahnya Christian and Robert Athlyi Rogers, author of The Holy Piby."]}, {"page": "Carol Patricia Rey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ijahnya Christian"]}]}}
