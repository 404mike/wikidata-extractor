Charles first became involved with dogs when he began to work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of dog biscuits. He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first dog show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895. He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois. He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 28", "response": ["*1852 \u2013 Charles Cruft, English showman, founded Crufts Dog Show (d. 1938)"]}, {"page": "September 10", "response": ["*1938 \u2013 Charles Cruft, English businessman, founded Crufts (b. 1852)"]}, {"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* Charles Cruft, founder of Crufts dog show"]}, {"page": "Jack Russell Terrier", "response": ["The club was later renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club. Badger digging required a different type of dog than fox hunting, and it is likely that Bull Terrier stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox terriers, a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell's name. Heinemann was invited to judge classes for working terriers at Crufts with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but Charles Cruft dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann's death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before World War II."]}, {"page": "The Kennel Club", "response": ["The first successful annual all-breed dog show was produced by Charles Cruft in 1891.

He bought up an entire issue of engravings by Edwin Landseer, the renowned dog portraitist, depicting a pointer in a turnip field to use on his cards.  His trademark became the 'X' that the young Cruft used to differentiate between trade and private customers in the company's ledgers.
