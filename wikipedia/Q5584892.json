He wrote for the Daily Mail and also worked as a scriptwriter and a feature editor for the BBC.\nIn 1951 Boshell left Fleet Street to join The World Health Organization as an information officer. During this time he worked in South East Asia and the Western Pacific, as well as in the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. Boshell returned to Britain in 1967 after which he and his wife lived in Wells, Somerset.\nBoshell's first published book was \"My Pen My Sword\" a collection of poetry originally published in the Daily Mail. The book was subtitled \"Bee of the Daily Mail\" which may have been Boshell's alias. Boshell then published two adult novels (\"John Brown's Body\", \"Dog's Life\"). His early works were influenced by the Second World War. For example, his poem \"The Aeroplane\" was written after watching the Battle of Britain dogfights from the streets of London.\nOn returning to the UK Boshell began writing children's books, beginning with the \"Captain Cobwebb\" series for which he is best known. He also wrote a trilogy of books known as \"The Secret Guardians\" series.\nBoshell co-created the \"Garth\" comic strip with Steve Dowling.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Garth (comic strip)", "response": ["Steve Dowling and Gordon Boshell were the originators of the Garth character.
