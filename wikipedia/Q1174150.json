Tyndale \"was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned\". His final words, spoken \"at the stake with a fervent zeal, and a loud voice\", were reported as \"Lord! Open the King of England's eyes.\" The traditional date of commemoration is 6 October, but records of Tyndale's imprisonment suggest that the actual date of his execution might have been some weeks earlier. Foxe gives 6 October as the date of commemoration (left-hand date column), but gives no date of death (right-hand date column).

Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut The use of the pseudonym \"Thomas Matthew\" resulted possibly from the need to conceal from Henry VIII the participation of Tyndale in the translation. A theory exists that indicates the name Thomas Matthew, which in Greek means \"A twin to the original gift from God\", may have been chosen to indicate that the largest contributing author was indeed William Tyndale and that his writings were preserved.", "Time and extensive scholastic scrutiny have judged Tyndale the most gifted of the three translators. Dr. Westcott (in his History of the English Bible) states that \"The history of our English Bible begins with the work of Tyndale and not with that of Wycliffe.\" The quality of his translations has also stood the test of time, coming relatively intact even into modern versions of the Bible. A. S. Herbert, Bible cataloguer, says of the Matthew Bible, \"this version, which welds together the best work of Tyndale and Coverdale, is generally considered to be the real primary version of our English Bible\", upon which later editions were based, including the Geneva Bible and King James Version. Professor David Daniell recounts that, \"New Testament scholars Jon NielsonPerhaps also written: John Nielson and Royal Skousen observed that previous estimates of Tyndale's contribution to the KJV 'have run from a high of up to 90% (Westcott) to a low of 18% (Butterworth)'. By a statistically accurate and appropriate method of sampling, based on eighteen portions of the Bible, they concluded that for the New Testament Tyndale's contribution is about 83% of the text, and in the Old Testament 76%.Daniell, David (2003) The Bible in English: history and influence.

Literary scholar David Daniell arrives at a similar conclusion, but from the opposite direction: as a good Protestant Shakespeare used many biblical allusions and quotations in his works, but only because his audience, well versed in the Bible in English, would quickly take his meaning.. Daniell cautions that Shakespeare's religious inclinations are not reliably deduced from his use of sources: Shakespeare knew Ovid and Plutarch well, but that didn't make him a Pagan. However, David Beauregard points out that the plays echo both Protestant and Catholic translations of the Bible, with some forty verbal correspondences to the 1582 Rheims New Testament, and they also conflict with the Elizabethan Homilies on at least ten theological topics, such as purgatory, prayers for the dead, indulgences, pilgrimages, merit, auricular confession and satisfaction.Beauregard, David (2008), pp. 24\u201339, 157\u201385 Schoenbaum suspects Catholic sympathies of some kind or another in Shakespeare and his family, but considers the writer himself to be a less than pious person with essentially worldly motives: \"...the artist takes precedence over the votary\".Schoenbaum (1977: 60\u201361):"]}, {"page": "David Daniell", "response": ["David Daniell may refer to:", "*David Daniell (musician) (born 1972), American guitarist and composer", "*David Daniell (cyclist) (born 1989), English competitive cyclist", "*David Daniell (author) (1929\u20132016), biographer of William Tyndale"]}, {"page": "David Daniell (Literary scholar)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Daniell (author)"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of St Catherine's College, Oxford", "response": ["* David Daniell"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of Hertford College, Oxford", "response": ["* David Daniell"]}, {"page": "The Half-Hearted", "response": ["David Daniell, writing in 1975, considered the novel to be flawed but interesting.
