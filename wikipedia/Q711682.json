The series features two major supporting characters, both prison officers: Mr Mackay played by Fulton Mackay, and Mr Barrowclough, played by Brian Wilde. The sitcom focuses on two prison inmates, Norman Fletcher (played by Barker) and Lennie Godber (played by Beckinsale), who are serving time in a fictional British prison. Porridge was critically acclaimed and is widely considered to be one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time.

Erwin James, an ex-prisoner who wrote a column for The Guardian, stated that: \"What fans could never know, however, unless they had been subjected to a stint of Her Majesty's Pleasure, was that the conflict between Fletcher and Officer Mackay was about the most authentic depiction ever of the true relationship that exists between prisoners and prison officers in British jails up and down the country.
