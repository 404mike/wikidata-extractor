The Labour party had hoped that following the death of Wilson, they would be able to either get a leading Durham miner to stand, such as Joseph Batey as their candidate or get a socialist to stand.  However, once the Durham Miners decided to back the Liberal Galbraith, a Labour candidate did not materialise.  The Unionists, who had not contested the seat for some time also decided not to contest the election.  The fact that Britain was now at war also contributed to the Unionist and Labour parties not contesting the seat."]}]}}
