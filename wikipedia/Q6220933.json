Willard was instrumental in passing the 18th and 19th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The 19th Amendment permitted women to vote in the U.S., and the 18th forbade the use of alcoholic beverage. Willard was the president of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union for 19 years (1879\u20131897).

Horatio Alger Jr., inspired by Gough's sketch, composed his own popular ballad in the summer of 1866 titled \"John Maynard, A Ballad of Lake Erie\". Already in November 1863, The British Workman (London, England) put out an untitled \"John Maynard\" ballad by the anonymous poet \"Josephine\", which accompanied the shortened sketch by J. B. Gough.

Her poems were meritorious productions, and she wrote enough to fill a large volume.

Her memorial odes to James A. Garfield and John Bartholomew Gough were widely quoted, as were also many other of her poems. Her lectures were always successful, and she was equally at home on the temperance platform, on the lecture platform, in the pulpit or at the author's desk.
