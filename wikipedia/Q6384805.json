Several of the buildings in the upper portion of the photograph were constructed under Madgwick's administration in the early 1960s.Between 1954 and 1960, the student body at New England more than doubled to over 500 students with a corresponding increase in staff and faculty, forcing the school to erect temporary, weatherboard huts to accommodate its expanded facilities and classrooms. In 1958, the university received \u00a3900,000 in government grants for facilities improvements and Madgwick presided over the planning and construction of over ten permanent buildings on the main campus, some of which were completed after Madgwick retired in 1966.Jordan, pp.\u00a085\u201390. The grant was the result of the Murray Committee's, led by Keith Murray, Baron Murray of Newhaven, report in 1957 which advised the Australian central government to greatly increase its spending and involvement with the nation's tertiary education system. The committee's work resulted in the Australian Universities Grants Committee, under the office of the Prime Minister, which from 1959 greatly increased the number and amounts of government grants provided to Australia's universities.
