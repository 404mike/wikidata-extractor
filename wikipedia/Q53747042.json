Pet of the Year names are in bold type and are typically featured in the January issue of the year for which they are selected. Unlike Playboy, it may be several years before a model becomes \"Pet of the Year\" after their initial centerfold. No model was selected in 1985.\nContrary to what has been written over the years by various media, the first Pet of the Year was not Evelyn Treacher. (Evelyn was on the cover of the first edition in the US (September 1969) and was the first Pet of the Month. She was also eligible for Pet of the Year as the selection process differs from Playboy's Playmate of the Year.) The election for the American edition of the magazine wasn't announced until the May 1971 issue. A few months later, the first Pet of the Year was selected, the winner being Stephanie McLean.", "link_mentions": []}}
