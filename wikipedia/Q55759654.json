He is best known as co-founder of The Violence Project and as co-author of the book, The Violence Project: How To Stop a Mass Shooting Epidemic. Densley has also published extensively on street gang issues and has been described as \"among the most accomplished rising leaders of modern gang research in criminology.\"Among criminologists, Densley is known for his ethnography of gang life in London, England, and his applications of economic signalling theory to gang membership. Densley's research examines group processes in gangs and compares gangs with other violent collectives such as hate groups and terror groups. He once compared the Islamic State to a \u201cstreet gang on steroids\u201d. Densley writes about the \u201cglocalisation\u201d of gang culture, cyber violence, and the role of rap music and social media in gang violence.Densley is a TEDx speaker and has written for CNN, The Conversation, The Guardian, The Herald, HuffPost, Los Angeles Times, MinnPost, Salon, StarTribune, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post, on a range of public issues, including gangs and gang responses, gun violence, knife crime, drug sales, school shootings, and violent extremism. He has appeared on CBS This Morning, CNN Tonight with Don Lemon, Viceland's Black Market: Dispatches with Michael K. Williams, and on local news to comment on criminal justice issues, including police use of force and law enforcement education and training.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Signalling theory", "response": ["Costly signalling can be applied to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates. When those peers are criminals or gang members, sociologists Diego Gambetta and James Densley find that risk-taking signals can help expedite acceptance into the group."]}, {"page": "University of Northampton", "response": ["* James Densley, academic and author"]}, {"page": "Gangs in the United Kingdom", "response": ["In 2018, researchers from London South Bank University found that gangs in the London borough of Waltham Forest that used to be organised around post code rivalries had moved beyond territorial disputes to focus on profit-making activities like drug dealing. They cite James Densley's gang evolution model, which details how gangs progress from recreational goals and activities like defending post codes to financial goals and activities like drug dealing. Densley concludes that fully evolved gangs \"resemble not just crime that is organized, but organized crime\". Densley also found that gangs in London also used handsigns and gang tattoos to denote gang membership. Some gangs in London are motivated by religion, as is the case with Muslim Patrol. However, profits arising from drugs and other criminal activity is a significant motivator for many gangs."]}, {"page": "Mass shooting", "response": ["In a 2019 op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, Jillian Peterson and James Densley of The Violence Project think tank presented a new, hopeful, framework to understand mass shootings. Based on a study funded by the National Institute of Justice, Peterson and Densley found mass shooters had four things in common: (1) early childhood trauma and exposure to violence at a young age; (2) an identifiable grievance or crisis point; (3) validation for their belief system, have studied past shootings to find inspiration; and (4) the means to carry out an attack. This new framework highlights the complexity of the pathway to a mass shooting, including how each one can be \u201csocially contagious,\u201d but also provides a blueprint to prevent the next mass shooting. Each one of the four themes represents an opportunity for intervention. By reducing access to firearms (means), slowing contagion (validation), training in crisis intervention de-escalation (crisis), and increasing access to affordable mental healthcare (trauma), a mass shooting can be averted."]}, {"page": "Densley", "response": ["*James Densley (born 1982), British-American sociologist"]}, {"page": "Densley, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Densley"]}]}}
