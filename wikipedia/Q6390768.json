Featuring a number of child actors, Todd Carty, Milo O'Shea, and Sydney Bromley also appear. The serial picture was produced for the Children's Film Foundation (CFF) by Roy Simpson of Mersey Film Productions, presenting a screenplay by Leo Maguire and soundtrack by Kenneth V. Jones. The story concerns an eccentric science teacher named Professor P. Popper, miniaturised with a group of pupils after accidentally consuming shrinking pills. A student apart from the group volunteers her help, as, separately, does a colleague of Popper's. As they search for an antidote, Popper and his entourage must see off multiple dangers, including criminals determined to steal his shrinking formula.", "The film's music was organised by Kenneth V. Jones, providing audio alongside sound recorder Laurie Clarkson. Drake sang the film's theme, \"I'm Big Enough for Me\", opined by writers Ian Jones and Graham Kibble-White to be a quintessential \"celebrity sing-a-long [...] the blessing of a star-led knees up\". The lead \"affected his best nasal upper-class vibrato\", they observe, \"cementing an otherwise unremarkable theme in the heads of a generation of viewers\". The song was also significant insofar as it became the B-side to Drake's track \"You Never Know\", released on 21 November 1975, notably featuring backing vocals by Peter Gabriel. Sandy Denny also sang a section in this latter tune, with instrumentals by Robert Fripp, Keith Tippett, Phil Collins, and Percy Jones.Easlea 2018, p. 44."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Victor Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth V.
