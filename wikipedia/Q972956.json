Tait, aged only 18, played poorly in his debut against Wales and was substituted by Olly Barkley who played in the remaining matches. Noon was solid, if unspectacular and retained his place.

At club level, he continued to play at 13, with the 12 shirt going to Henry Paul. The partnership was heavily criticised and Tindall reportedly spent much of the season showing a poor run of form despite selection. Henry Paul broke club rules and fell out of favour with Gloucester Rugby coach, Dean Ryan during an incident at Tindall's girlfriend's birthday party. Young centre, Anthony Allen, was subsequently introduced, which helped forge the start of a \"powerful\" centre partnership between the two towards the end of the season. His partnership with Jamie Noon was criticised, with claims that the bulky partnership lacked imagination and play-making ability. Tindall has a strong cult following however, and is often nicknamed \"The Fridge\" due to his sizeable bulk."]}, {"page": "2005 Six Nations Championship", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Jamie Noon||3||align=\"left\"|"]}, {"page": "CA Brive", "response": ["* Jamie Noon"]}, {"page": "Fyling Hall School", "response": ["* Jamie Noon"]}, {"page": "Noon (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Jamie Noon, English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Riki Flutey", "response": ["Flutey decided to join Top 14 club Brive, from the 2009\u201310 season, joining other English internationals such as Andy Goode, Steve Thompson and Jamie Noon.
