He started competing internationally at the age of 12 for the British Children's Ski Team. He represented Great Britain at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver where he took part in the men's downhill, super-G, giant slalom and combined despite partially tearing his anterior cruciate ligament shortly before the Games. Drake is a four-time British champion winning the giant slalom and combined in 2008 and 2009. In 2013 he switched from alpine skiing to ski cross after competing in his first ski cross event, a World Cup competition in Meg\u00e8ve, in January of that year when an alpine FIS race he was planning to enter was cancelled. He narrowly missed out on qualifying for the ski cross competition at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. In May 2016 Drake announced his retirement from racing. Following his retirement Drake turned to broadcasting, commentating on Eurosport's World Cup coverage and becoming a newsreader for 107.8 Radio Jackie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2009 \u2013 Men's super-G", "response": ["|align=left|Edward Drake ||align=left|"]}, {"page": "FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2009 \u2013 Men's downhill", "response": ["|align=left|Edward Drake ||align=left|"]}, {"page": "FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2009 \u2013 Men's super combined", "response": ["|align=left|Edward Drake ||align=left|"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's downhill", "response": ["| 38 || 43 || align=left| Edward Drake ||align=left|  || 1:57.91 || +3.60"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's combined", "response": ["|   || 36 || align=left| Edward Drake ||align=left|  || 1:56.63 ||  || 54.28 ||  || 2:50.91 || +5.99"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's giant slalom", "response": ["| 37  || 49 || align=left| Edward Drake ||align=left|  || 1:21.65 ||  || 1:23.48 || 34 || 2:45.13  || +7.30"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's super-G", "response": ["|  || 33 || align=left| Edward Drake ||align=left|  || 1:33.20 || +2.86"]}, {"page": "Ed Drake", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Drake (skier)"]}, {"page": "Edward Drake (Skier)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Drake (skier)"]}, {"page": "FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships 2013 \u2013 Men's ski cross", "response": ["|  42 || 54 || align=left| Edward Drake ||align=left|  || 58.52 ||"]}, {"page": "Edward Drake", "response": ["Edward Drake may refer to:", "* Edward Drake (skier) (born 1986), British alpine skier and ski cross racer", "* Edward Drake (cricketer) (1832\u20131904), English clergyman and cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of British alpine skiers", "response": ["* Edward Drake, competed at the 2010 Winter Olympics."]}]}}
