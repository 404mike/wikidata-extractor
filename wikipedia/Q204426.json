In addition, the pair wrote both sides of the non-album single, \"I Feel Fine\" backed with \"She's a Woman\", which accompanied the LP's release. At this stage in their partnership, Lennon and McCartney rarely wrote together as before, but each would often contribute key parts to songs for which the other was the primary author. Nevertheless, Lennon's level of contribution to Beatles for Sale outweighed McCartney's, a situation that, as on A Hard Day's Night, author Ian MacDonald attributes to McCartney's commitment being temporarily sidetracked by his relationship with English actress Jane Asher.", "The lyrics of \"What You're Doing\" concern McCartney's relationship with Jane Asher and demonstrate an aggrieved tone that was uncharacteristic of his writing. Author Simon Philo identifies the song's combination of musical arrangement, \"sonic texture\" and lyrics as an early example of the influence of cannabis on McCartney, who said the drug made him start \"really thinking for the first time\". The recording features a syncopated drum pattern and a jangly Rickenbacker guitar riff, as well as an instrumental coda that McCartney introduces by playing high up on the neck of his H\u00f6fner bass. A satisfactory arrangement proved elusive until the band remade the track on the final day of the Beatles for Sale sessions.

Gould identifies the song as the third consecutive track in which the narrative conveys miscommunication.

The verses use the same chord sequence as the Four Tops' hit \"It's the Same Old Song\", which was titled by its writers, the Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland team, in acknowledgement that they had already used the same pattern in their composition \"I Can't Help Myself\"."]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["\"For No One\" was inspired by McCartney's relationship with English actress Jane Asher. Along with \"Good Day Sunshine\", which similarly dispensed with guitar parts for Harrison and Lennon, Rodriguez cites the track as an example of McCartney eschewing the group dynamic when recording his songs, a trend that would prove unpopular with his bandmates in later years. The recording features McCartney playing piano, bass and clavichord, accompanied by Starr on drums and percussion. The French horn solo was added by Alan Civil, the principal horn player for the Philharmonia Orchestra, who recalled having to \"busk\" his part, with little guidance from McCartney or Martin at the overdubbing session. While recognising McCartney's \"customary logic\" in the song's musical structure, MacDonald comments on the sense of detachment conveyed in the lyrics to this \"curiously phlegmatic account of the end of an affair\".
