There have been at least eighteen English impressions, some published without the subtitle. The Readers Union edition (1953), and the 'concise' version (ed. S. H. Burton) brought out by Longmans and Green in their 'Heritage of Literature Series' for schools (1960), helped popularise the book. The dust-cover of the English 2nd edition (Kimber, London, 1974) gives a 1970s' photograph of Benuzzi, Balletto and Barsotti and biographical updates; the 3rd English edition (Patrick Stephens Ltd, Wellingborough, 1989, Introduction by Rick Ridgeway), updates the biographical information. In 1999 Lyon Press republished the book with the subtitle A Daring Escape, a Perilous Climb. In 2015 MacLehose Press brought out a new edition, with some twenty of Benuzzi's own watercolours from the expedition (all, for the first time, in colour), two contemporary photos of the Nanyuki POW camp, and a full translation of 'L'ignoto' (see above) from the Italian original."]}, {"page": "Port-Cros", "response": ["The last marquis of the islands was Louis de Colvet, Mirabeau's father-in-law.  Colvet sold the islands to Jean Joseph Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Simon de Savornin in 1783.  In 1793, the British attacked Port-Cros again.  Napoleon restored the defenses in 1811 and installed a garrison of veterans.  After the fall of the First French Empire, the garrison was replaced by a company of crippled soldiers.  The marquisate was purchased by the French state in 1815, and changed hands a number of times before being sold to a Dr. Crotte, who tried to develop the island into a tourist resort.  Some facilities for tourists, including a hotel, were built when the island was acquired by Marcel Henry and Claude Balyne.  Between the  interwar period, the island was visited by numerous figures of the artistic and literary world: Jean Paulhan, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Saint-John Perse, Paul Val\u00e9ry and Jules Supervielle. Vivienne de Watteville lived there from 1929, and wrote a book about her first year on the island, Seeds that the Wind may bring."]}, {"page": "List of travel books", "response": ["*Vivienne de Watteville (1900\u20131957)"]}, {"page": "St Mary's Church, Hopesay", "response": ["The churchyard contains two Second World War Commonwealth war graves of a soldier of the Royal Army Service Corps and the ATS.
