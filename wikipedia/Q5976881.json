Wihan and others had asked for a cello concerto for some time, but Dvo\u0159\u00e1k refused, stating that the cello was a fine orchestral instrument but completely insufficient for a solo concerto.Smaczny, 1999, p. 1 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed the concerto in New York while serving as the Director of the National Conservatory. In 1894 Victor Herbert, who was also teaching at the Conservatory, had written his Second Cello Concerto op. 30 and presented it several times that year, including its successful premiere with the New York Philharmonic under Anton Seidl. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k attended at least two performances of Herbert's cello concerto and was inspired to fulfill Wihan's request for a cello concerto. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's concerto premiered in London on 16 March 1896, with the English cellist Leo Stern. The reception was \"enthusiastic\". Brahms said of the work: \"Had I known that one could write a cello concerto like this, I would have written one long ago!\" Agreeing with Schonberg, the cellist and author Robert Battey wrote \"I believe it to be the greatest of all cello concertos...an opinion shared by most cellists\". A compiler of discographies of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music wrote that his is the \"king\" of cello concertos.Yoell, John H., \"Dvo\u0159\u00e1k in America: A Discography\", Appendix C of "]}, {"page": "1896 in music", "response": ["*March 19 \u2013 Leo Stern is soloist in the premi\u00e8re of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Cello Concerto, in B minor, Op. 104, B. 191, at the Queen's Hall in London."]}, {"page": "Cello Concerto (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)", "response": ["The Cello Concerto in B minor, Op.\u00a0104, B.\u00a0191, is the last solo concerto by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.

An account of the sequence of events whereby it did not happen is given by Clapham.Clapham 1979, Norton, pp. 86, 148\u2013149 Francesco Berger, Secretary of the London Philharmonic Society, wrote to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k in November 1895 to invite him to conduct a concert of some of his works in London. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k agreed and proposed to conduct the premiere of his Cello Concerto with Wihan as soloist. Berger proposed the date 19 March 1896, but that date was not convenient for Wihan (it may have clashed with concert dates for the Bohemian Quartet, to which Wihan was already contracted). The Philharmonic Society insisted on the date and hired the English cellist Leo Stern without consulting Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. The composer then at first refused to come for the concert. \"Berger was horrified and greatly embarrassed,\" as the concert had already been advertised. Clapham conjectures that Wihan released Dvo\u0159\u00e1k from his promise. Stern traveled to Prague to prepare his performance under Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's supervision. By early March, all was agreed, and the premiere took place on 19 March in Queen's Hall, London, with Dvo\u0159\u00e1k conducting.

Wihan made various suggestions for improvement, some of which Dvo\u0159\u00e1k accepted.  But he would not accept Wihan's suggested cadenza for the final movement as it clashed with his idea of the movement as a tribute to his seriously ill sister-in-law. It was intended that Wihan would perform the premiere of the work in London on 19 March 1896, but his contractual obligations with the Czech String Quartet clashed with the only possible date for the premiere.  The soloist was the little-known Leo Stern. There was no truth to a rumour that the two men had any sort of falling out over the matter. Wihan did perform the concerto in The Hague (under Willem Mengelberg, or Dvo\u0159\u00e1k), Amsterdam and Budapest (the last under the composer's baton), and he took part in the premiere of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's G major Quartet, Op. 106, that year.  Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's original score, before it was altered with Wihan's suggested changes, has been described as \"much more musical\", and this version has been performed from time to time.Dimitry Markevitch, Some Thoughts on More Rational Cello Fingerings"]}, {"page": "List of Stradivarius instruments", "response": ["|General Kyd; ex-Leo Stern", "|Leo SternLos Angeles PhilharmonicRobert deMaine"]}]}}
