Nicknamed \"Big Mal\", he was one of English football's most flamboyant and intriguing characters because of his panache, fedora and cigar, controversies off the pitch and outspoken nature.\nAllison's managerial potential become apparent while in his youth at West Ham United, where he became a reliable defender and acted as a mentor to the younger players including future England World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore. His playing career was cut short in 1958 when he had to have a lung removed because of tuberculosis.\nAs a coach, he is remembered for assisting manager Joe Mercer in the transformation of the team he supported as a young boy \u2013 Manchester City. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Allison won six major trophies in seven years with Mercer. After Mercer left, he managed the club on two occasions whilst offering his managerial services for a third time in 1989. He also managed several more English clubs including Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough, as well as three in Portugal and the Kuwait national team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plymouth Argyle F.C.", "response": ["* 1964  Malcolm Allison", "* 1978  Malcolm Allison"]}, {"page": "Walter Winterbottom", "response": ["He soon created a national coaching scheme with summer residential courses at Lilleshall, Shropshire, and persuaded some of his international players to take the courses that led to exams for the FA preliminary and full coaching badges.

He gathered around him a cadre of young FA staff coaches: men like Bill Nicholson, Don Howe, Alan Brown, Ron Greenwood, Dave Sexton, Malcolm Allison, Joe Mercer, Vic Buckingham, Jimmy Hill and Bobby Robson.

The club had its first major period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, European Cup Winners Cup, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in its history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001\u201302 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002\u201303.", "After being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.Ward, The Manchester City Story, p. 57 In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.Penney, Manchester City \u2013 The Mercer-Allison Years, pp. 27\u201336 Two seasons later, in 1967\u201368, Manchester City claimed the League Championship for the second time, clinching the title on the final day of the season with a 4\u20133 win at Newcastle United and beating their close neighbours Manchester United into second place.Penney, Manchester City \u2013 The Mercer-Allison Years, pp. 37\u201356 Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 before achieving European success by winning the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970, beating G\u00f3rnik Zabrze 2\u20131 in Vienna.Gardner, The Manchester City Football Book No. 2, pp. 13\u201322 City also won the League Cup that season, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.", "A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s.

Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 and finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of Peter Reid.James, Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p. 68 However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season they endured three seasons of struggle before being relegated in 1996.  After two seasons in Division One, City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third league tier, after 1.

Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs \u2013 Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.James, Manchester: The Greatest City pp. 14\u201315 The red and black away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison, who believed that adopting the colours of A.C. Milan would inspire City to glory. Allison's theory worked, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup Final, 1970 League Cup Final and the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Malcolm Allison     || DF (centre half)", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Malcolm Allison || centre half || assistant mgr.  manager"]}, {"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["In March 1984, Malcolm Allison left Middlesbrough and Charlton agreed to manage the club until the end of the 1983\u201384 to help steer the club away from the Second Division relegation zone.

Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.", "There were variations on this theme until 1963 when the club adopted the away strip of yellow shirts as its home colours. In 1964, the club changed to an all-white strip modelled on Real Madrid whom Palace had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club continued with variations on this theme up until Malcolm Allison's arrival as manager in 1973. Allison overhauled the club's image, adopting red and blue vertical stripes for colours and kit, inspired by FC Barcelona.
