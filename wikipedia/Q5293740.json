Not an accomplished player, though he had previously captained the club's Second XI, he was a good man-manager and a firm disciplinarian who could get the best out of what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons.Arlott, pp. 98\u201399. The other \"trouble-maker\", Appleyard, lost his ability as a result of his illnesses and Yorkshire dropped him for good mid-season. Although the team could only finish 11th in the County Championship, having lost 24 full days to the weather, it was a much happier dressing room than it had been since 1946. Regular team members now included Binks, Brian Bolus, Burnet, Close, Cowan, Trueman, Illingworth, Lowson, Padgett, David Pickles, Phil Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman, Don Wilson and Vic Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was really beginning to take shape.Arlott, p. 99.", "In 1962, Yorkshire regained the County Championship title, but had to defeat Glamorgan on the final day of the season to secure the necessary points. Vic Wilson retired at the end of the season. The main players were Binks, Bolus, Close, Illingworth, Padgett, Ryan, Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman, Don Wilson and Vic Wilson. In another outstanding season of pace and swing, Trueman took 153 first-class wickets in 33 first-class appearances. He also scored 840 runs, which was the best season tally of his whole career but, because of inconsistency, he remained well short of the standard required if he was to be termed an all-rounder, though that is not something he ever pursued given his workload as a specialist bowler. In a five-Test series that year, England made short work of a Pakistan team that was weak in attack. As in 1961, Trueman played in the first four Tests but not the fifth Test at the Oval. He took 22 wickets in the series, his best match being the second Test at Lord's in which he took nine, the highlight being six for 31 in the first innings to bowl Pakistan out for only 100.Playfair 1963, p. 52."]}, {"page": "Donald", "response": ["* Don Wilson (American football) (born 1961), American football player", "* Don Wilson (announcer) (1900\u20131982), American radio and television announcer and actor", "* Don Wilson (Australian footballer) (1914\u20132015), Australian footballer", "* Don Wilson (baseball) (1945\u20131975), American baseball pitcher", "* Don Wilson (cricketer) (1927\u20132012), English cricketer", "* Don Wilson (pastor) (born 1949), American Christian pastor and creationist"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Don Wilson"]}, {"page": "Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Don Wilson", "Geoff Boycott returned to the England team and, with perhaps a nod towards the venue, the selectors also picked his Yorkshire colleagues Don Wilson and the 21-year-old Chris Old. The World XI decided to strengthen their batting and Mushtaq Mohammad replaced Peter Pollock. Gary Sobers won the toss and Wisden recalled that he gambled by putting England in to bat \"on a slow-drying pitch\". Having struggled to reach 209 for four after a very poor start, England disintegrated completely in the face of a remarkable piece of bowling by Eddie Barlow who took four wickets in five balls, emulating the feat of Maurice Allom in New Zealand in 1930\u201331. Barlow dismissed Keith Fletcher, England's top scorer, and Alan Knott came in to bat. Barlow dismissed Knott second ball and then completed a hat trick by dismissing Chris Old and Don Wilson with his next two deliveries. The World XI's batting was impacted by back injuries sustained by Barry Richards and Rohan Kanhai while fielding. Richards could not open the innings so Deryck Murray was promoted and he scored a determined 95 in five hours but the World XI were on 152 for four when Gary Sobers came in to rally them, in Wisden's words, \"with another splendid century\". Once again, England staged a second innings recovery with half-centuries by Boycott, Brian Luckhurst, Fletcher and Ray Illingworth. Barlow with five for 78 completed a match analysis of twelve for 142. Needing 223 to win with a day and a half to go, the World XI slumped to 62 for five on the Monday afternoon. This brought Sobers and Intikhab together and they survived to the close with the overnight score at 75 for five. They needed another 148 to win and two of their remaining batsmen were the injured Kanhai and Richards. On Tuesday morning, a crucial incident occurred at 82 for five when Tony Greig at second slip dropped Intikhab off John Snow. Wisden reckoned that England would have won and squared the series if the catch had been taken. Intikhab and Sobers steadily moved the score forward until both were out shortly before lunch. Kanhai, batting despite his injury, was out immediately after lunch and the World XI were then on 183 for eight with 40 more needed.

Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever provided good support to the two quick bowlers, Lever took 7/83 against the Rest of the World at the Oval, and Shuttleworth 5/47 in the First Test at Brisbane, but neither held down a regular Test place. Basil d'Oliveira helped with his tidy medium pace swing bowling and occasional off-spin. Illingworth himself was an off-spinner of nagging accuracy who contained batsmen rather than took wickets, conceding only 1.91 runs an over in Tests.
