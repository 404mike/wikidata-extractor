His trademark rubber-neck dance, skeletal frame and peculiar speech impediment made him a formidable and funny comedian and pantomime dame. His later years were spent as a character actor in film and television, and appearing in pantomime. Jackley appeared in three Royal Variety shows, topping the bill in summer shows throughout Britain's seaside resorts and in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Widow Twankey", "response": ["*Nat Jackley 1951 London Casino"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Clitheroe", "response": ["* Stars in Your Eyes (1956) with Nat Jackley \u2013 as Joey"]}, {"page": "When the Boat Comes In", "response": ["|Left-winger Regan threatens a strike at Lewis Bishop unless a sacked worker is reinstated.

In one of these scenarios, she played a fairy in a take-off of the ballet Swan Lake. In others she used her singing talent to comedy effect as an opera singer, or a concert pianist whose only ability was to play only the wrong notes. Becoming successful in her own right, it was not long before other performers eventually persuaded her to let them join her - and consequently, she appeared on a number of occasions with the gangling and ungainly Nat Jackley in a much-loved turn called 'At the Ball'. Jackley's angular body contrasted marvellously with Jumel's small figure in an overtight ball gown, which was split up one side to reveal her funny, wafer-thin legs. In 1959 she appeared in an early broadcast on the very long running BBC TV programme, The Good Old Days, performing a chaotic routine as an Opera singer in a theatrical costume which fell apart while she fell about the stage in the time honoured tradition of music hall."]}, {"page": "List of Royal Variety Performances", "response": ["| From High Time - The Girls, Tony Hulley, Barbara Bentham, Brent Fields, Billy Castle, Bobby Tranter and Mary Naylor, The Cairoli Brothers, Nat Jackley with Harry Moreny, Dick Beamish, Arthur Vollum, Sammy Curtis, Bob Bromley and his puppets, Terry-Thomas Dance Ensemble with Alan and Blanche Lund, Gil Johnson, the Three Ross Sisters, Halama and Konarski, The Cabana Accordion Six, Nat Mills and Bobbie, Robert Lamouret, Arthur Askey, Harry Lester and his Hayseeds, Tessie O'Shea, Charlie Chester, Dick Henderson, Jimmy Jewel, Charlie Naughton, Jimmy Gold, Eddie Gray, El Grenadas and Peter, Jack Jackie, Koba and Kalee, Reggie Redcliffe, Rene Strange, Henri Vadden, Sid Field with Jerry Desmonde, Alfie Dean, The Wallabies and the Palladium Boys & Girls, Ben Warriss, Marianne Lincoln, Oscar Natzka, Band of the Training Ship.", "| Tommy Trinder, Sheila Matthews, The 20 John Tiller Girls, The Three Bentley Sisters, The Debonairs, Terrys Juveniles, Hall, Norman and Ladd, Max Bygraves, Billy Cotton and his Band, Frankie Howerd, The Five Smith Brothers, Kaye Ballard, Helen Gallagher, Carole Lynne, Allan Jones, The Merry Macs, Gracie Fields, The George Mitchell Glee Club, Jonathan Lucas, David Lober, Donald Peers, Jack Benny, Dinah Shore, Binnie Hale, Nat Jackley, Naughton and Gold, Max Wall, Nervo and Knox, Max Miller, Flanagan and Allen, The Band that Jack Built."]}, {"page": "List of acts that have appeared on the Royal Variety Performance", "response": ["*Nat Jackley: 1946, 1950"]}, {"page": "List of Minder episodes", "response": ["|colspan=\"3\"|Guest stars: James Booth as Godfrey, Avril Elgar as Mrs Bickerton-Jones, David Jackson as Marion, Norman Eshley as Rev.
