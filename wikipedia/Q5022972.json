By the end of the battle, the Allies had taken prisoner more than 500 Germans. A joint hospital was set up near Adele, with German and Australian doctors working alongside each other. Conditions for all of the wounded were grim, with parachutes being cut up for bandages and no anesthetics. Most of the German dead lay where they had fallen; there were more than 400 bodies in front of the Allied positions. They bloated in the sun and were attacked by ravens. Intelligence officers searched them for documents, they were looted for souvenirs and the locals stole their boots. Beevor states some bodies were \"hacked about by civilians\". The state of the bodies resulted in claims of the mutilation and torture of wounded paratroopers, which were picked up and broadcast by Nazi radio."]}, {"page": "Malcolm MacDonald (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Callum Macdonald (1912\u20131999), also known as Malcolm Macdonald, Scottish printer and publisher"]}, {"page": "Calum MacDonald", "response": ["* Callum Macdonald (1912\u20131999), Scottish publisher"]}, {"page": "Callum MacDonald (publisher)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Callum Macdonald "]}, {"page": "Callum Macdonald (publisher)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Callum Macdonald"]}, {"page": "1952 in Scotland", "response": ["* Poetry magazine Lines Review is founded by Callum Macdonald in Edinburgh."]}, {"page": "Victoria Crowe", "response": ["*National Galleries of Scotland: Portraits including Callum Macdonald (1996), Graham Crowden (1996) and Winifred Rushforth (1982)"]}]}}
