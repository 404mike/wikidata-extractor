He is equally well known for hosting the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful interactive DVD game Pub Quiz: Hosted by Vince Earl. In it, he deploys his famous wit and charm to crack jokes and ask questions in such a way that it creates a convivial, pub-like atmosphere.\nHe was involved in the Merseybeat scene of the 1960s as singer with the Vince Earl and the Talismen, and Vince Earl & the Attractions. He also played in the band \"Rory Storm and the Hurricanes\" and The Wirral band The Zero's who played in the Majestic nightclub Conway street Birkenhead in the early 1960s. He is a stand up comedian who appeared on the Granada Television show The Comedians before landing the Brookside part. As Frank in the film No Surrender his performance was both menacing and hilarious at the same time. He also appeared in Boys from the Blackstuff.In 2001, while still appearing in Brookside, Earl appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank. In November 2007, Earl returned to the set of Brookside in West Derby, Liverpool for an interview with ITV Local News to celebrate 25 years since the show started on Channel 4. He showed reporters around the Close, showing them his character's house, and the infamous patio where Trevor Jordache was found. Michael Starke, who played Sinbad Sweeney, also featured in the interview from the set of his new soap home at Coronation Street.\nHe is a supporter of Liverpool F.C.\nIn 2010, he was hospitalised with Goodpasture's syndrome which resulted in the need for regular dialysis. In the summer of 2012, he successfully underwent a kidney transplant.Earl has gone on record as saying that his favourite scene of Brookside was a breakfast scene filmed entirely in one shot. Earl's character, Ron, sat in the centre of the scene as various other characters attempted to steal his breakfast, ultimately leading Ron to exclaim: \"Hey! Where's me tea gone?\".\nEarl has also declared that he prefers stand-up to acting as he relishes the 'immediate feedback' offered by the former.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brookside (TV series)", "response": ["In 1990, there was a near-wholesale cast turnover: Billy and Sheila married and then departed for Basingstoke,20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White. Page 67-68 Jonathan Gordon-Davies left for London, the relatively new Chois emigrated to America and Harry Cross moved to St Helens. They were quickly replaced by a raft of new characters. The Farnhams bought number 7, the Dixons arrived at number 8, the reunited Johnson family settled into number 6, and Sue Harper married Terry Sullivan and they started married life at number 9 with baby Danny. The influx of new families had arrived in very quick succession. Max and Patricia Farnham (Steven Pinder and Gabrielle Glaister) moved into number 7 in September and were the soap's new 'professional' couple, along with their son Thomas, and live-in nanny Margaret Clemence (Nicola Stephenson). In direct contrast, working-class Ron and DD Dixon (Vince Earl and Irene Marot) drove onto Brookside Close during October in the 'Moby', a huge mobile shop, and moved into number 8 with their family, thus beginning a long-running feud between the two families which would last the rest of the series.Brookside: The First Ten Years.

Finally, with the rest of the Grant family gone, remaining original character of Barry Grant was developed and became increasingly involved in various dubious plots with the Liverpool underworld.", "Like many of the families who came and went in Brookside, the Dixon family also ended in divorce after Ron (Vince Earl) had an affair with Bev McLoughlin (Sarah White), which ended his long marriage to his first wife Deborah \"D.D\" O'Farrell (Irene Marot) who then left the series. During the break up of Ron and DD's marriage, Bev had a one-night stand with Ron's eldest son Mike (Paul Byatt), resulting in the birth of Josh. Ron and Bev lived together for a while, renaming number 8 Cassa-Bevron. This was until Ron almost had an affair with his employee at the Trading Post, Jackie Corkhill (Sue Jenkins), and when Bev eventually found out, she set fire to Cassa-Bevron and fled the Close in 1996. Ron then moved out of number 8 and rented it to Sinbad and his new girlfriend, Carmel O'Leary (Carol Connor), the mother of troublesome teenager Tim 'Tinhead' O'Leary (Philip Olivier). Later in 1999, Ron met and remarried an old flame, Anthea Brindley (Barbara Hatwell), the mother of his long-lost (and quickly forgotten) daughter, Megan, who looked identical to his Ron's other daughter Jacqui. Although initially happy and starting up their own successful business together, Great Grannies, this marriage also ended in divorce when Anthea refused to lie in court after Ron shot dead Clint Moffat (Greg Pateras) whilst being held hostage in the kitchen of number 8. This was alleged to be an act of 'self-defence', but resulted in Ron spending six months in prison. This storyline was based on the real-life case involving Tony Martin who shot an intruder on his property in an alleged act of self-defence.20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White. Page 145", "Although to a small degree Brookside's terminal ratings slide since its 1995 peak had been temporarily halted, plots started going around in circles before finally being resolved with Nikki Shadwick's date-rape storyline, Diane Murray's infatuation with pregnancy, and the long drawn-out breakdown of Jimmy and Jackie Corkhill's marriage being good examples of this. Another long term character, the notoriously accident prone Susannah Morrisey, was finally killed off when she fell down the stairs of number 7.

This was arguably the last time Brookside made a significant impact in the ratings, being pushed back up to over 6 million when Max was revealed to be the culprit, although a final twist was revealed in flashback; Susannah had actually tripped over a toy as she argued with Max at the top of the stairs resulting in the fatal fall. All murder charges were dropped, leaving Max free to marry his previous next-door neighbour, Jacqui Dixon (Alexandra Fletcher), who became his third wife in 2001. Max and Jacqui continued to live at number 7 where Max had resided with his previous two wives, before they swapped houses with Ron Dixon (Vince Earl) next door at number 8, where Jacqui had previously lived with her family. Mick Johnson, played by Louis Emerick for over 12 years, then fled the Close after a suicide attempt, and Jimmy Corkhill descended into madness, eventually being diagnosed bipolar, but these were storylines which, to viewers and critics alike, obviously demonstrated the writers were running out of steam and there were serious questions about the lack of direction the soap was now heading."]}, {"page": "The Comedians (1971 TV series)", "response": ["Comedians appearing on the show included Russ Abbot (as Russ Roberts), Lennie Bennett, Stan Boardman, Jim Bowen, Jimmy Bright, Duggie Brown, Mike Burton, Dave Butler, Brian Carroll, Frank Carson, Johnnie Casson, Eddie Colinton, Mike Coyne, Jimmy Cricket, Colin Crompton, Bob Curtiss, Pauline Daniels, Charlie Daze, Les Dennis, Vince Earl, Steve Faye, Ray Fell, Eddie Flanagan, Stu Francis, Mike Goddard (known as Mike Goodwin in the early years of the show), Ken Goodwin, Jackie Hamilton, Jerry Harris, Jimmy Jones, Mike Kelly, George King, Bobby Knutt, Bernard Manning, Jimmy Marshall, Mike McCabe, Paul Melba, Mick Miller, Pat Mooney, Hal Nolan, Tom O'Connor, Tom Pepper, Bryn Phillips, Don Reid, Mike Reid, George Roper, Harry Scott, Paul Shane, Phil Silvers, Pat Tansey, Sammy Thomas, Johnny Wager, Roy Walker, Jos White, Charlie Williams, Lee Wilson and Lenny Windsor."]}, {"page": "Dick & Dom in da Bungalow", "response": ["A running gag through the early seasons of the show featured a minor, and often somewhat cult, celebrity, locked in a cage in the dungeon of the Bungalow.
