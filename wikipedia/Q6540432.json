The rock climber found the rare hybrid on a Carboniferous Limestone cliff at Avon Gorge in 2005. DNA analysis of nuclear microsatellites at the University of Bristol was performed and confirmed the nature of the new hybrid. The tree was officially named after Houston in February 2009 in Volume 27, Part 3 of Watsonia, the journal of the Botanical Society of the British Isles. It is a member of the Sorbus latifolia group. The Somerset Rare Plants Group indicates that the tree's Red List status is critically endangered, although the site of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) indicates that the tree has not yet been assessed for the list, but is in the Catalogue of Life. The short film, Houston's Whitebeam (link below), which related the discovery of the tree, was a finalist in the ONSIGHT & Panasonic contest \"Bristol's Best Kept Secret\" at the Wildscreen Film Festival in 2008. The filmmaker proposed that Houston's whitebeam was Bristol's best kept secret. The festival, hosted every two years by Bristol, was founded in 1982 and is dedicated to \"celebrating, applauding and encouraging excellence and responsibility within the wildlife and environmental filmmaking industry.\"", "* Photograph of Libby Houston and Houston's Whitebeam, 2009"]}, {"page": "List of women botanists", "response": ["| Libby Houston"]}, {"page": "Andreas Weiland", "response": ["In 1967 he founded the poetry magazine Touch with Steven R.
