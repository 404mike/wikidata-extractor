Many went into the damp London tunnels. After the war, the British Museum, lucky enough not to be bombed, reassembled the collection. After two years stored in high humidity, the objects were severely damaged with metal corrosion, mold and salt efflorescence. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom) (DSIR) hired Scottish Alexander Scott (chemist) (1853-1947), as director of scientific research in what became the British Research Laboratory in 1920. In 1922, conservator and archaeologist, Harold Plenderleith (1898-1997), became the first full time chemist affiliated with a museum laboratory. Together they started the first scientific conservation in the United Kingdom while studying the instability of the rapid deterioration. In 1934, Harold Plenderleith published \u201cThe Preservation of Antiquities\u201d which contains vital information on the conservation preservation of metals and the Agents of Deterioration we know today.Simon Lambert (2014) The Early History of Preventive Conservation in Great Britain and the United States (1850-1950), CeROArt 9/2014, Online since 13 January 2014, connection on 29 April 2020.
