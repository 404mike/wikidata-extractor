Just like Californian officers, Boxhall attempted signaling the ship with a Morse lamp, but received no response. However, Titanic lookout Frederick Fleet, who was in the crow's nest when the iceberg was sighted and remained there for another forty minutes, testified at the US inquiry that he did not see the lights of another ship while in the crow's nest.

After serving with the Royal Navy in World War II and the Korean War, he resumed his acting career and appeared in over 30 cinema films from 1956 to 2004, including two cinematic dramatizations of the sinking of the doomed passenger liner the RMS Titanic, separated by 39 years, viz, Titanic (1997) (as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV) and the earlier version of the tragedy A Night to Remember (1958) (uncredited as Frederick Fleet). In the latter, he delivered the line \"Iceberg dead ahead, sir!\" while playing the part of the sailor in the ship's crow's nest. His other screen roles ranged from supporting parts in broad comedies (Yellowbeard, Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, and The Private Eyes, playing a homicidal butler in the last) to supplying the voice of the Chairmouse in the Disney animated features The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under. He played the role of Winston Havelock, a put-out-to-grass former Royal Flying Corps airman in the 1999 adventure film The Mummy. In 2004, Fox made his final appearance in Surge of Power: The Stuff of Heroes.", "|1958 || A Night to Remember || Lookout Frederick Fleet || Uncredited"]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["*Frederick Fleet: British sailor, known for being on look out on the HMS Titanic."]}, {"page": "Titanic (1996 miniseries)", "response": ["| Byron Lucas || Lookout Frederick Fleet"]}, {"page": "Miyu Irino", "response": ["*Titanic, Frederick Fleet"]}, {"page": "January 1965", "response": ["**Frederick Fleet, 77, British member of the crew of the RMS Titanic who had been the first to sight the iceberg that ultimately sank the ship in 1912"]}]}}
