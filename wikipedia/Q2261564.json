He is most associated with two of the UK's best known and influential punk bands, the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Rhodes was responsible for discovering John Lydon and arranging his audition in the King's Road which led to Lydon joining the Sex Pistols. He introduced Joe Strummer to Mick Jones and Paul Simonon, who with Keith Levene then formed The Clash.\nRhodes was an important force behind The Clash not only managing their business but also guiding their marketing and creative direction. Disagreement with the group about direction led to his sacking by the Clash in 1979. Rhodes meantime continued with other successful signings to his label Oddball Productions and major record companies. In 1981 singer Joe Strummer demanded his return to the Clash or he would quit the group.\nRhodes nurtured and managed other bands including Subway Sect, The Specials, Dexys Midnight Runners, Jo Boxers, The Lous, The Black Arabs, Twenty Flight Rockers, and Watts from Detroit. During this period Rhodes built and operated from his Camden studio Rehearsal Rehearsals, in what became Camden Market. The area around the studio became a well known hangout for punks and contributed to the growth of Camden as a hip area.\nHe is also known in Brazil for his friendship with  Supla and baptising the band \"Brothers of Brazil\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Punk rock", "response": ["Bernard Rhodes, an associate of McLaren, similarly aimed to make stars of the band London SS, who became the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer.Savage (1992), pp. 124, 171, 172. On 4 June 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in what became one of the most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig\u2014they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and\u2014in the 1980s\u2014the Smiths. In July, the Ramones played two London shows that helped spark the nascent UK punk scene.Taylor (2003), p. 56; McNeil and McCain (2006), pp. 230\u2013233; Robb (2006), pp. 198, 201. Quote: Robb (2006), p. 198. Over the next several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often directly inspired by the Sex Pistols.See, e.g., Marcus (1989), pp. 37, 67. In London, women were near the center of the scene\u2014among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors, while Sex store frontwoman Jordan not only managed Adam and the Ants but also performed screaming vocals on their song \"Lou\". Other groups included Subway Sect, Alternative TV, Wire, The Stranglers, Eater and Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20\u201321, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the Sex Pistols, Clash, Damned and Buzzcocks, as well as Paris's female-lead Stinky Toys. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested having thrown a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident reinforced punk's reputation as a social menace.Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 111; Gimarc (2005), p. 39; Robb (2006), pp. 217, 224\u2013225."]}, {"page": "Sex Pistols", "response": ["The group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes, and had performed publicly for the first time. Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale was kicked out of the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 84\u201385. According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones & His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it).Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 85\u201386. McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group. When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 93; Savage, Jon. England's Dreaming, pp. 98\u201399. As described by Matlock, \"Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer\".Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 110. For instance, Midge Ure, the former singer with boy band Slik who was also later to be the front man of Rich Kids (with Matlock) and Ultravox, claims to have been approached by McLaren, but to have refused the offer.\"Midge Ure interview\", Global Friends of Scotland. Archived 14 January 2009. With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who also turned down the invitation.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 93\u201394; Savage, Jon.

Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 110\u2013111; Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 120; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 98. According to Jones, \"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole\u2014but smart.\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to SEX, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \"I'm Eighteen\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 120\u2013121; Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, p. 71."]}, {"page": "The Clash", "response": ["Mick Jones played guitar in protopunk band London SS, which rehearsed for much of 1975 without ever playing a live show and recording only a single demo. London SS were managed by Bernard Rhodes, a sometime associate of impresario Malcolm McLaren and a friend of the members of the McLaren-managed band, the Sex Pistols. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols Glen Matlock and Steve Jones, who would assist them as they tried out potential new members. Among those who auditioned for London SS without making the cut were Paul Simonon, who tried out as a vocalist, and drummer Terry Chimes. Nicky Headon drummed with the band for a week, then quit.", "The recording sessions for Cut the Crap were chaotic, with manager Bernard Rhodes and Strummer working in Munich. Most of the music was played by studio musicians, with Sheppard and later White flying in to provide guitar parts. Struggling with Rhodes for control of the band, Strummer returned home.

Under the moniker Rhode-Twinn, Matlock (and Steve New) was brought to play on Gary Twinn's 1990 single \"Bike Boy\" on Bernard Rhodes' own Sacred record label.
