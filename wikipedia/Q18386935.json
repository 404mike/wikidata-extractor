He was not selected for that match, but after Hull's attempt to sign former Scotland international winger Jimmy Delaney fell through, Robson came into the team to face Nottingham Forest a fortnight later. Hull lost 4\u20131, but Robson kept his place for the next game, a 2\u20131 defeat at Brentford. He scored his side's goal, Hull's first from open play in five games, despite intending his left-wing cross as a centre for Nicklas. Neither youngster was retained for the next match. Robson stood in for the ageing Raich Carter for the Christmas Day visit to Blackburn Rovers, another defeat, but that was his last appearance for Hull."]}, {"page": "Nicklas", "response": ["*Charlie Nicklas (born 1930), English footballer"]}]}}
