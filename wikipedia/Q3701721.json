While Andy, named after Davies' boyfriend Andrew Smith, was a minor character and departed in the third episode, Holly featured throughout the entirety of the series. Bob & Rose thus followed a similar format to Queer as Folk, in particular, the triumvirate of main characters composed of a couple and an outsider who lived in contemporary Manchester, and inverted the traditional \"coming out\" story by focusing on Bob's uncharacteristic attraction to Rose; Bob describes his sexual life by simply speaking the line \"I fancy men. And her.\" The series was similar to the Kevin Smith film Chasing Amy (1997), as they both portrayed a romance between a straight character and gay character and the resulting ostracism from the couple's social circles, much like The Second Coming shared its concept with Smith's 1999 film Dogma."]}, {"page": "Glengarry Glen Ross", "response": ["On 26 October 2017, a revival in London's West End directed by Sam Yates opened at the Playhouse Theatre, running for 14 weeks.

It follows her various trials and tribulations in love and her relationships with her friends, in particular Jimmy McKenzie (Sean Gallagher), a mechanic at the car showroom where Linda works, and with whom she enjoys sexual relations when she feels like it, Michelle Fenton (Claire Rushbrook), a chiropodist, and Darren Alexander (Daniel Ryan), a kitchen-fitter. The latter two characters are a cohabiting couple with children, Jamie (Lee Shepherd) and Leanne (Jodie Hamblet), and, in series 2, a new baby, Eric. Despite the demands of parenthood, Michelle and Darren enjoy frequent nights out, usually at the club, with Linda and Jimmy. Linda's mother, Iris, who works as a clerk in the magistrates' court, is played by Rachel Davies, and her father, Frank, a deputy headteacher, by Dave Hill. Linda also has two siblings, both considerably younger than her: the very bright Katie (Jessica Harris), in whom Linda frequently confides, and the easy-going Philip, a.k.a. Fizz (Bruno Langley), who is hoping to join the Army, rather against his father's wishes. As well as being the eldest child, Linda is also her father's favourite, although he is always careful never to treat the other two less favourably. Both Frank and Iris are always ready to provide a shoulder to cry on when Linda is unhappy, usually as a result of a failed relationship. One of Linda's former boyfriends, the much younger Ricky Pinder (John Donnelly), becomes a semi-regular in the show when he becomes Katie's boyfriend. The other club singer, Coral (Jacinta Sloan) and the club comic (Danny De Bouy) also appear on a semi-regular basis."]}, {"page": "Messiah (British TV series)", "response": ["* DS Terry Hedges (Daniel Ryan, Series 5)"]}, {"page": "Steel River Blues", "response": ["* Daniel Ryan \u2014 Firefighter Andy Coulson"]}, {"page": "Bob & Rose", "response": ["* Daniel Ryan as Andy Lewis"]}, {"page": "Daniel Ryan", "response": ["* Daniel Ryan (figure skater) (died 1961), American ice dancer who competed with partner Carol Ann Peters", "* Daniel Ryan (actor) (born 1968), English actor and writer", "* Daniel Ryan Sr., American politician", "* Daniel Ryan (Tasmanian politician) (1870\u20131953), Australian politician", "* Daniel Ryan (Queensland politician) (1865\u20131952), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly"]}, {"page": "Royal Court Theatre", "response": ["* Posh by Laura Wade, starring Simon Sheperd, Joshua McGuire, Daniel Ryan, Richard Goulding, Kit Harington, Harry Hadden-Paton, Leo Bill, David Dawson, James Norton, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Tom Mison, Fiona Button and Charlotte Lucas (2010)"]}, {"page": "Don Warrington", "response": ["Warrington appeared as George in David Mamet's Glengarry Glenn Ross between October 2017 and February 2018 at the Playhouse Theatre alongside Christian Slater, Robert Glenister, Kris Marshall and Daniel Ryan."]}, {"page": "Fay Ripley", "response": ["In 2006, Ripley played the role of child abductor Linda Holder in the two-part ITV drama Bon Voyage, starring alongside Ben Miles, Rachael Blake and Daniel Ryan.

She liked the style of Canadian director John Fawcett in making the thriller, as it differed to that of other British thrillers, which she believed were poorly filmed.
