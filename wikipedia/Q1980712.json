He acknowledged Hector Berlioz as an influence, alongside Gustav Mahler, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and jazz. Several commentators have drawn a comparison with Jean Sibelius. Arnold's most significant works are generally considered to be his nine symphonies. He also wrote a number of concertos, including one for guitar for Julian Bream, one for cello for Julian Lloyd Webber, two for clarinet for Frederick Thurston and Benny Goodman, one for harmonica for Larry Adler and one \u2013 enthusiastically welcomed at its premiere during the 1969 Proms \u2013 for three hands on two pianos for the husband-and-wife team of Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick. His sets of dances \u2013 comprising two sets of English Dances (Opp. 27 and 33), along with one set each of Scottish Dances (Op. 59), Cornish Dances (Op. 91), Irish Dances (Op. 126), and Welsh Dances (Op. 138) \u2014 are mainly in a lighter vein and are popular both in their original orchestral guise and in later wind and brass band arrangements. The English Dances also form the basis for Kenneth MacMillan's short ballet Solitaire, and one of them has been used as the theme music for the British television programme What the Papers Say (the Cornish Dances has provided the theme music for the television programmes of the cook Rick Stein). Arnold also wrote some highly successful concert overtures,Cooke, Mervyn (2005). Malcolm Arnold: Concert Overtures  (PDF). Chandos Records. Retrieved 2011-07-03. including Beckus the Dandipratt (an important stepping stone in his early career), the strikingly scored Tam o' Shanter (based on the famous Robert Burns poem), the rollicking A Grand Grand Overture (written for a Hoffnung Festival and featuring three vacuum cleaners and a floor polisher, all in turn polished off by a firing squad in a mock 1812 manner), and the dramatic Peterloo Overture (commissioned by the Trades Union Congress to commemorate the historic massacre of protesting workers in Manchester). Another popular short work is his Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet (Op. 37). Arnold is also known for his relatively large number of compositions and arrangements of his own compositions for brass band. In 1954, Beckus the Dandipratt was given a radio studio performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski, who was thanked by the composer for his \"wonderful performance.\""]}, {"page": "National Gramophonic Society", "response": ["The most prolific NGS recording artists were three string quartets: the Spencer Dyke String Quartet and Andr\u00e9 Mangeot's Music Society String Quartet and International String Quartet.
