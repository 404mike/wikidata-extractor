Abraham spent most of his career in the United States and was the Albert Cook Outler Professor of Wesley Studies at Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University. He previously taught at Seattle Pacific University and was a visiting professor at Harvard Divinity School. \nAbraham was associated with the Confessing Movement in the United Methodist Church and was a proponent of canonical theism, a church renewal movement that looks to the canons of the ancient ecumenical church as a source for renewing mainline Protestant churches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Dummett", "response": ["In 1944, Dummett was received into the Roman Catholic Church and remained a practising Catholic.

The movement has been very successful in maintaining doctrinal standards and traditional United Methodist positions on theology and practice at the General Conferences in Cleveland (2000), Pittsburgh (2004), and Fort Worth (2008).  At the 2008 conference for instance delegates voted to retain language in the Social Creed defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman. General Conference closes with message of hope after addressing budget, social issues  They also maintained the traditional teaching, that although homosexuals \"are individuals of sacred worth\", homosexual practice is \"incompatible with Christian teaching.\" After the 2019 United Methodist General Conference, the denomination became sharply divided over the issue of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. Because of this split, there has been speculation about the UMC separating or dividing into two or more denominations. An exit plan for dissatisfied congregations was passed by the 2019 General Conference and upheld by the Judicial Council (top court of the United Methodist Conference). In addition, there are proposals for annual conferences to take place for the purpose of regular doctrinal evaluation."]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 602 || Methodism || William J.

Systematic theologian William J. Abraham defines analytic theology as \u201csystematic theology attuned to the deployment of the skills, resources, and virtues of analytic philosophy. It is the articulation of the central themes of Christian teaching illuminated by the best insights of analytic philosophy.\u201dWilliam J. Abraham, \u201cSystematic Theology as Analytic Theology,\u201d in Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology, ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford\u202f; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 54. Philosopher Michael Rea defines analytic theology as \u201cthe activity of approaching theological topics with the ambitions of an analytic philosopher and in a style that conforms to the prescriptions that are distinctive of analytic philosophical discourse. It will also involve, more or less, pursuing those topics in a way that engages the literature that is constitutive of the analytic, employing some of the technical jargon from that tradition, and so on. But, in the end, it is the style and the ambitions that are most central.\u201dMichael C. Rea, \u201cIntroduction,\u201d in Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology, ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 7. Cambridge theologian Sarah Coakley, by contrast, warns that attempts to set down an essentialist definition for analytic theology (i.e. a club that some are in and some are not welcome in) will distract from the productive work resulting from the recent flourishing of AT.Sarah Coakley, \u201cOn Why Analytic Theology Is Not a Club,\u201d Journal of the American Academy of Religion 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 604-605.", "* Analytic theology versus systematic theology. The difference between analytic theology and systematic theology is a third question that has been raised. Michael Rea's introduction in the 2009 analytic theology volume has not been received well by some theologians. Analytic Theology has thus been challenged as legitimately theology. Some suspect it is no more than philosophy in theological costume. William Abraham argues that analytic theology is systematic theology and that it was only a matter of time before something like analytic theology took root in the theological world.William J. Abraham, \u201cSystematic Theology as Analytic Theology,\u201d in Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology, ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford\u202f; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 54\u201369. Oliver Crisp has published an article demonstrating how analytic theology could qualify itself as systematic theology. Crisp cites leading theologians to demonstrate that there is no agreed-upon definition for systematic theology. He then shows how analytic theology shares a common task and goals with systematic theology and rises above a conceptual threshold established by the way various theologians view systematic theology.Oliver D. Crisp, \u201cAnalytic Theology as Systematic Theology,\u201d Open Theology 3, no. 1 (January 26, 2017): 156\u2013166. In a 2017 interview, Oliver Crisp suggests that analytic theology is not attempting to take over the work of theology, but is instead suggesting an additional set of resources that theologians could turn to find help in their theological projects.See https://www.closertotruth.com/episodes/what-analytic-theology", "* 2nd Generation (Writers who released their first works in the 1980s.)
