Born in Sheffield Bairstow had been playing for Sheffield Club when he was signed by newly formed Sheffield United in March 1890. He spent just over two years at Bramall Lane but as the team became more successful his appearances were limited to the large number of friendlies that the club still played at that time.Bairstow was eventually released and played for local side Penistone before joining Barnsley St. Peter's for whom he was a regular and made his FA Cup debut.  He was later reported to have died in Barnsley of typhoid.There appears to have been some confusion over Bairstow's family name as in early match reports the local press would often use a variety of spellings including Bairstoe, Bairsto, Baisto, Bastoe and Bastow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sheffield F.C.", "response": ["* Billy Bairstow"]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["Ironically, their first two new signings were a Scot, William Calder, and another local amateur, T.B.A. Clarke, who both arrived in December 1889 but the team was beginning to take on a more professional image. The team continued their campaign of friendly fixtures into 1890, with varying degrees of success, whilst competing in the FA Cup for the first time. With the club hoping to be accepted into the newly formed Midland Counties League for the following season the committee made a number of additions to the squad in March, signing Billy Bairstow from local side Sheffield Club but more significantly signing a trio of players from nearby Rotherham Swifts. Rab Howell, Arthur Watson and Michael Whitham would all become stalwarts of the team in the coming seasons, with both Howell and Whitham subsequently going on to represent England. They represented United's first reported entry into the transfer market, arriving for a combined fee of \u00a3200, and signalled a new era of full professionalism for the club."]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["|Billy Bairstow"]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["With United set to play in the newly formed Football League Second Division the club looked to strengthen its squad, as a number of fringe players departed Bramall Lane.  Squad players William Getliff and W. Nesbitt were not retained, and long-serving defender Ned Stringer retired from playing to take up a scouting post with the club.  Billy Bairstow was allowed to join local side Penistone, while Thomas Smith's brief stay with the club came to an end as he was signed by Yorkshire neighbours Barnsley."]}]}}
