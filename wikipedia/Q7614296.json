Injury and, according to Beattie, \"a combination of the drink and depression\" curtailed his spell at the club.Finch, p. 131. After failing to secure any coaching work, Beattie took up work as a labourer, and joined local team Harwich & Parkeston to supplement his income.Finch, p. 136. Accepting an offer from Ipswich's former scout Ron Gray, Beattie joined Swedish second-tier side Sandvikens IF under manager and former Swedish international player, Thomas Nordahl.Finch, pp. 136\u2013137. Soon afterward, Nordahl suddenly resigned and the club let Beattie go. He moved to Norway, signing for fourth division club Kongsberg IF, where he scored more than 60 goals in his first season.Finch, pp. 137\u2013138. He signed for Norwegian second division club Nybergsund IL-Trysil in 1988, making five appearances for them before moving back to England.Finch, pp. 139\u2013140. He also played for Clacton Town. He assisted Mike Walker and Duncan Forbes at Norwich City as a scout during Walker's time as manager and performed a similar role for Alan Ball Jr. at Portsmouth.Finch, p. 148. Beattie's first foray into coaching was a part-time position at his hometown club Carlisle United under Roddy Collins in the 2002\u201303 season.Finch, pp. 151\u2013152. Collins was sacked early in the 2003\u201304 season, and Beattie left the club, subsequently opting to coach school children in the United States.Finch, p. 153. His last coaching position was a short spell with Barry Fry at Peterborough United."]}, {"page": "Peter Rodrigues", "response": ["Rodrigues was signed by Leicester City in December 1965, to fill the right back position, moving John Sjoberg into the centre of the field. He was an established Welsh international when he arrived at City for a club record fee of \u00a342,500. Rodrigues' attacking full back play set a standard to City's play in the next decade and when Steve Whitworth replaced Rodrigues he played with the same passion to go forward. Rodrigues was a fine over-lapping full-back who was renowned for his sliding tackles."]}, {"page": "Eric Skeels", "response": ["From September 1960 he missed just eleven matches in seven seasons, establishing a reputation for his consistency and became known as 'Mr Dependable'. During his career at the Victoria Ground he played in every outfield position, filling in as and when required. In his natural position he was a defensive midfielder, although he made most of his appearances in the back four. Never a flashy player, he won a Second Division winner's medal in 1962\u201363 and a League Cup runners-up medal in 1964. Against Leicester City in August 1971, Skeels broke his leg in a tackle with Steve Whitworth. He battled his way back to fitness in time to replace the injured Denis Smith for the League Cup semi-final against West Ham United, helping Stoke to reach the 1972 League Cup Final, where they beat Chelsea 2\u20131. Skeels established a club record for league appearances towards the end of the 1974\u201375 season, and with war-time fixtures considered unofficial he also lays claim to record appearance holder in all competitions with 597. He had already been awarded a joint-testimonial match with Tony Allen against Derby County in February 1969 when he was given a free transfer by Stoke in June 1976."]}, {"page": "1971\u201372 in English football", "response": ["7 August 1971: The 1971 FA Charity Shield is held, but without reigning League and Cup winners Arsenal, who are on a pre-season tour abroad.
