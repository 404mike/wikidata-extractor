Kelvin calculated the age of Earth by using thermal gradients, and he arrived at an estimate of about 100 million years.

In 1895, John Perry produced an age-of-Earth estimate of 2 to 3 billion years using a model of a convective mantle and thin crust, however his work was largely ignored.

He published, both alone and jointly with others, a large number of papers on physical, and in particular electrical, subjects, and his name was especially associated, together with that of Professor John Perry, with the invention of a long series of electrical measuring instruments, including the spiral-spring ammeter, and the wattmeter.

The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem.  In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for the Electrician, explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). Her paper was entitled \"The Hissing of the Electric Arc\". Shortly thereafter, Ayrton was elected the first female member of the IEE; the next woman to be admitted to the IEE was Dorothy Smith in 1958. She petitioned to present a paper before the Royal Society but was not allowed because of her sex and \"The Mechanism of the Electric Arc\" was read by John Perry in her stead in 1901. Ayrton was also the first woman to win a prize from the Society, the Hughes Medal, awarded to her in 1906 in honour of her research on the motion of ripples in sand and water and her work on the electric arc. By the late nineteenth century, Ayrton's work in the field of electrical engineering was recognised more widely, domestically and internationally. At the International Congress of Women held in London in 1899, she presided over the physical science section. Ayrton also spoke at the International Electrical Congress in Paris in 1900. Her success there led the British Association for the Advancement of Science to allow women to serve on general and sectional committees.", "In 1902, Ayrton published The Electric Arc, a summary of her research and work on the electric arc, with origins in her earlier articles from the Electrician published between 1895 and 1896. With this publication, her contribution to the field of electrical engineering began to be cemented. However, initially at least, Ayrton was not well received by the more prestigious and traditional scientific societies such as the Royal Society. In the aftermath of the publication of The Electric Arc, Ayrton was proposed as a Fellow of the Royal Society by renowned electrical engineer John Perry in 1902. Her application was turned down by the Council of the Royal Society, who decreed that married women were not eligible to be Fellows. However, in 1904, she became the first woman to read a paper before the Royal Society when she was allowed to read her paper \"The Origin and Growth of Ripple Marks\" and this was later published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. In 1906, she was awarded the Royal Society's prestigious Hughes Medal \"for her experimental investigations on the electric arc, and also on sand ripples.\" She was the fifth recipient of this prize, awarded annually since 1902, in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications, and as of 2018, one of only two women so honoured, the other being Michele Dougherty in 2008."]}, {"page": "Physical Society of London", "response": ["*1906\u20131908 John Perry"]}, {"page": "John Perry", "response": ["John Perry may refer to:", "*John Perry (1845\u20131922), Australian politician, member for Richmond, Ballina and Byron", "*John Perry (1849\u20131935), Australian politician, member for Liverpool Plains", "*John Perry (Irish politician) (born 1956), Irish politician", "*John Perry (MP) (c. 1630\u20131732), English politician, MP for New Shoreham", "*John Perry (footballer) (born 1945), Australian football player", "*Pete Perry (basketball) (John Perry, born 1948), American basketball player", "*John Perry (American football, born 1950), American football coach", "*John Perry (American football, born 1969), American football coach", "*John Perry (musician) (born 1952), English musician, guitarist with The Only Ones", "*John Perry (philosopher) (born 1943), American philosopher", "*John Perry (bishop) (born 1935), Anglican Bishop of Southampton and Chelmsford", "*John Perry (engineer) (1850\u20131920), Irish engineer", "*John Perry (judge) (1937\u20132007), judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia", "*John Perry (shipbuilder) (1743\u20131810), British ship builder", "*John Perry (priest) (1920\u20132017), Archdeacon of Middlesex", "*John Perry, English singer, member of Grapefruit and Tony Rivers and the Castaways", "*John Perry, playwright who collaborated with M.
