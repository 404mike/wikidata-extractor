The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph.Dickinson (1995), p. 25 Head comments on the innovative character of the Hymn: \"At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s\". Matthews has written that the Hymns \"ecstatic\" quality is matched in English music \"perhaps only by Tippett's The Vision of Saint Augustine\"; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and \"explosive chordal dislocations\".", "After this, Holst tackled his final attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with The Wandering Scholar (1929\u201330), to a text by Clifford Bax.

A discussion about astrology piqued Holst's interest in the subject. Clifford Bax later commented that Holst became \"a remarkably skilled interpreter of horoscopes\".Short, p. 113 Shortly after the holiday Holst wrote to a friend: \"I only study things that suggest music to me.
