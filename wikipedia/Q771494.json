He made his debut for Leeds in a 2\u20131 West Yorkshire derby win over Huddersfield Town a week later. Less than a month after joining the side, Bamba was named captain for three games in place of Liam Cooper. In particular, he served as captain when Leeds beat the then league leaders Middlesbrough 1\u20130, with Bamba receiving praise for his performance.", "In the offseason, Bamba was appointed captain of Leeds by head coach Uwe R\u00f6sler, taking over from previous captain Liam Cooper. Bamba received the man of the match award in a 1\u20131 draw against Burnley in the league on the opening day of the season. Bamba scored a \"stunning\" long range volley against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 2\u20131 win late in the season. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, Bamba was again critical of Leeds owner Cellino, calling on him to put 'promises to action'. He revealed the players were unaware if head coach Steve Evans would be retained for the following 2016\u201317 season, that the players were unaware of when to return for pre season training and they were told they would find out 'by text' when Cellino had made a decision.", "Nonetheless, new head coach Garry Monk announced Bamba would remain as Leeds captain for the 2016\u201317 season. On 7 August, Bamba scored an own goal against Queens Park Rangers in a 3\u20130 defeat in the opening match of the season and was subsequently dropped from the side, falling behind Kyle Bartley, Liam Cooper and Pontus Jansson in the pecking order. On 1 September 2016, Bamba, despite being Leeds' captain, was released by the club. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent following the close of the transfer window the previous day. The decision was made after Monk informed him that he would no longer be first choice at the club."]}, {"page": "EFL Awards", "response": ["* Liam Cooper"]}, {"page": "Malet Lambert School", "response": ["*Liam Cooper,  Premier league footballer and captain of Leeds United"]}, {"page": "List of Leeds United F.C. players", "response": ["|2015||2015||Liam Cooper||Sol Bamba||", "|2015||2017||Liam Bridcutt||Liam Cooper||Kyle Bartley", "|2017||Pres.||Liam Cooper||Luke Ayling||Gaetano Berardi"]}, {"page": "Hull City A.F.C.

Trotman returned to the first team on 12 January 2013 after the club's injury crisis in defence and made an impressive performance in a 3\u20130 win over Northampton Town. After the match, Trotman was praised by Cook as \"absolutely magnificent\" and \"manful\". Since returning to the first team, he was featured in a number of matches for the side.

After returning from injury after six weeks out injured, Berardi in only his second game back, picked up a separate serious injury on 24 October 2018 in a 2\u20130 win against Ipswich Town after suffering a hyperextention injury to the hamstring, which would rule him out for several months. Rob Price, Leeds' Head of Medicine, revealed the seriousness of the injury by revealing Berardi \"tore his hamstring completely off the bone\". During the 2018\u201319 season, Berardi played 13 matches across the regular season after an injury hit campaign, with Leeds finishing the regular season in third place despite spending the majority of the season in the automatic promotion places, and therefore qualifying for the promotion play-offs. Berardi started the Championship semi-final first leg as Leeds went 1\u20130 up away to Derby County, but was sent off in the 78th-minute of the second leg for a foul on Bradley Johnson as Leeds lost 4\u20132 (4\u20133 on aggregate). The red card was the seventh of Berardi's Leeds career, equalling Alan Smith as the most red-carded player in the club's history."]}]}}
