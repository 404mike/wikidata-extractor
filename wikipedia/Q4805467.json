Crewe took the lead on thirteen minutes through Max Clayton, but Bolton equalised when Martin Petrov converted a penalty midway though the first half. With no further goals scored, Bolton still remained without a win during the pre season. The first win of the pre-season came in the following game, when two early goals from Chris Eagles and David N'Gog, playing his first game after injury had kept him out of the previous fixtures, gave Bolton a 2\u20130 victory over Morecambe. This was followed by a 3\u20130 loss at Portsmouth, where the home side scored two goals through Kieran Djilali and Liam Lawrence, with Ashley Harris scoring a third in the second half. New signing Benik Afobe made his first appearance for Bolton as a substitute during the game. Afobe made his second appearance for the club, and scored a hat trick, in Bolton's penultimate pre season game, as they beat Tranmere Rovers 3\u20131, Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro replying for the home team. Bolton concluded their pre-season with a 2\u20132 draw at home at Barcelona B. The home side, playing their only pre-season game at The Reebok Stadium, twice came from behind, Marvin Sordell and a Sergi G\u00f3mez own goal cancelling out efforts by Cristian Lobato and Iv\u00e1n Balliu."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Ashley Harris, footballer, was born in Purbrook"]}]}}
