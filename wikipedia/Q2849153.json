Ten years later, he started his first rock band with high school friends Phil Mogg and Pete Way called UFO. He joined the group at the age of 16 in 1969. While he joined the band, he recruited guitarist Mick Bolton. Later as the group was gaining momentum, Parker and Mogg started having \"run-ins\" with Bolton and fired him shortly after. Parker, Mogg, and Way then needed a guitarist and recruited German future virtuoso Michael Schenker.\nParker has been in UFO from 1969 to the present. Parker had medical problems between late 2005 and early 2007, and his spot in UFO was briefly filled by Jason Bonham, until Parker's medical issues were taken care of.He lives, together with his wife, in Granbury, Texas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Granbury, Texas", "response": ["* Andy Parker \u2013 founding drummer of the English rock group UFO; resides in GranburyThen Andy met Jo | Hood County News- A twice-weekly newspaper serving Granbury and Hood County, Texas  Retrieved 2018-04-11."]}, {"page": "UFO (band)", "response": ["UFO are  an English rock band that was formed in London in 1968. They became a transitional group between early hard rock and heavy metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. The band's current lineup includes vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, and drummer Andy Parker. They have gone through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had two breaks (1983\u20131984 and again from 1989 to 1991). The band are also notable for featuring former Scorpions guitarist and MSG founder Michael Schenker, who was a member of UFO from 1973 to 1978 and had rejoined the band sporadically between 1993 and 2003, when Moore replaced him. In May 2018, Mogg announced that he would retire from UFO after one last tour as a member of the band in 2019; however, the band plans to resume their farewell tour in 2022.", "Lead singer Phil Mogg, guitarist Mick Bolton, bassist Pete Way and drummer Andy Parker formed the band in 1968. Having originally called themselves Hocus Pocus, the group changed their name in October 1969 to UFO, in honour of the London club where they were spotted by Noel Moore, who signed them to the Beacon Records label, headed by Antiguan-born Milton Samuel. Their first album, UFO 1, released in 1970, is a typical example of early hard rock; it includes a heavy version of the Eddie Cochran classic \"C'mon Everybody\". Neither their first nor their second album, UFO 2: Flying, was successful, but the song \"Boogie For George\" from the first album reached No. 30 on the German singles chart, and \"Prince Kajuku\" from Flying reached No. 26. At this time UFO attracted little interest in Britain and America. Some of their early work was strongly influenced by space rock (their second album, featuring a 26-minute title track and a 19-minute-long track \"Star Storm\", was subtitled One Hour Space Rock) that was modestly popular at the time, but the band soon realised the style was somewhat limited. Mick Bolton left the group in January 1972, and UFO set out to find a guitarist who could provide the band with a more standard rock sound.", "In 2004, UFO released their 17th studio album You Are Here with their new permanent guitarist Vinnie Moore and Jason Bonham on drums (intermittently). UFO recorded their live set and released a double-DVD recording titled Showtime (2005) along with a double live CD on SPV in November 2005, mixing a number of re-recorded studio songs. In November 2005, Andy Parker returned to the band to play in the Piorno Rock Festival in Granada, Spain.
