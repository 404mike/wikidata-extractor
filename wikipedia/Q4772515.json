The Earl of Munster was the last of the male line of FitzClarences that began with King William IV (Duke of Clarence until his accession in 1830) and his mistress, the comic actress Dorothea Jordan (n\u00e9e Bland).\nThe King's eldest son by Jordan, George FitzClarence, was created Earl of Munster in 1831. He was granted arms at the same time, consisting of the royal arms of Great Britain surmounted by a baton sinister charged with anchors, as a mark of bastardy. The seventh earl made his way in the world without trading on his lineage, working variously as a publican, a graphic designer on newspapers, and latterly as an expert on medieval stained glass.\nOn 15 November 1983, he inherited the earldom on the death of his father Edward FitzClarence, 6th Earl of Munster. From then until the Government's expulsion of the hereditary peers in 1999, as part of the House of Lords Act 1999, he was a regular attender at the House of Lords. For a short time he sat on the cross benches, but soon moved to the Conservative side of the House. A shy man, he spoke rarely there, content to be one of those silent peers that made the Lords, as Byron thought, so formidable an audience.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Edward's School, Oxford", "response": ["* Anthony FitzClarence, 7th Earl of Munster"]}, {"page": "FitzClarence", "response": ["*Anthony FitzClarence, 7th Earl of Munster (1926\u20132000)"]}, {"page": "Henry Grayson", "response": ["* Monica Sheila Harrington Grayson (d. 1958), who married Edward FitzClarence, 6th Earl of Munster and was the mother of Anthony FitzClarence, 7th Earl of Munster."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society of Arts", "response": ["* Anthony FitzClarence, 7th Earl of Munster"]}]}}
