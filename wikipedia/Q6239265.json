He served on several ships during the years of peace between the end of the American War of Independence and the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, and was promoted to lieutenant shortly after the outbreak of the latter conflict. He served in the English Channel and the Mediterranean, and was one of the officers of HMS Minotaur at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. He was promoted to commander for his good service in the battle, but only commanded one ship, the troopship HMS Heroine, before the Peace of Amiens.\nHe distinguished himself in the service of the Transport Board during the Napoleonic Wars, overseeing the movement of troops to and from continental Europe and earning the thanks of Swedish royalty and the Duke of Wellington. Advanced to post-captain, he continued in this role for some years after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, until being appointed Captain-Superintendent of Deptford Victualling Yard. The remainder of his career was spent ashore at the navy's dockyards, moving to Sheerness Dockyard and then back to Deptford. He was knighted for his services in 1831, and while at Sheerness in 1838, oversaw preparations for selling HMS Temeraire. He retired in 1851 with the rank of rear-admiral and died in 1855.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HMS Temeraire (1798)", "response": ["Kennedy received orders from the Admiralty in June 1838 to have Temeraire valued in preparation for her sale out of the service.

Kennedy delegated this task to Captain Sir John Hill, commander of . Her masts, stores and guns were all removed and her crew paid off, before Temeraire was put up for sale with twelve other ships. She was sold by Dutch auction on 16 August 1838 to John Beatson, a shipbreaker based at Rotherhithe for \u00a35,530. Beatson was then faced with the task of transporting the ship 55 miles from Sheerness to Rotherhithe, the largest ship to have attempted this voyage. To accomplish this he hired two steam tugs from the Thames Steam Towing Company and employed a Rotherhithe pilot named William Scott and twenty five men to sail her up the Thames, at a cost of \u00a358."]}, {"page": "John Hill", "response": ["John Hill may refer to:", "* John Hill (planter) (1824\u20131910), Scottish-born American industrialist and planter", "* John Hill (businessman) (1847\u20131926), Australian coach-horse operator", "* John Hill (cartoonist) (1889\u20131974), New Zealand cartoonist", "* John Hill (game designer) (1945\u20132015), American designer of Squad Leader and other wargames", "* Dean Koontz or John Hill (born 1945), American author", "* John Hill (screenwriter) (died 2017), American screenwriter and television producer", "* John Hill (actor) (born 1978), American musical theater actor", "* John Hill (conductor) (born 1843), Australian church organist and choirmaster", "* John Hill (musician) (active from 1993), American guitarist with the Apples in Stereo and Dressy Bessy", "* John Hill (record producer) (active 2008 and after), American record producer, songwriter, and musician", "* John Hill (active 1968), English bassist in Band of Joy", "* John Hill, British conspiracy theorist and creator of the 2007 documentary 7/7 Ripple Effect", "*John Hill (courtier) (before 1690\u20131735), British general and courtier, brother of Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham", "*John Hill (British Army officer) (fl. 1777\u20131783), British Army officer during the American War of Independence", "*John Hill (Royal Navy officer) (c. 1774\u20131855)", "*John Hill (Indian Army officer) (1866\u20131935), British general", "*John Hill (died 1408), English Member of Parliament and Justice of the King's Bench", "*John Hill (MP for Wycombe) (fl. 1436), English MP for Wycombe", "*John Hill (MP for Dorchester) (1589\u20131657), English Member of Parliament for Dorchester", "*Sir John Hill, 3rd Baronet of the Hill baronets of Hawkstone (1740\u20131824), British MP for Shrewsbury", "*John Hill (British politician) (1912\u20132007), British Member of Parliament and Member of the European Parliament", "* John Hill (North Carolina politician) (1797\u20131861), United States Representative from North Carolina", "* John Hill (Virginia politician) (1800\u20131880), United States Representative from Virginia", "* John Hill (New Jersey politician) (1821\u20131884), United States Representative from New Jersey", "* John Hill (Texas politician) (1923\u20132007), American lawyer and politician", "* John Hill (Florida politician) (born 1931)", "*John Hill (Australian politician) (born 1949), member of the South Australian House of Assembly", "* John Hill (botanist) (1716\u20131775), English botanist, editor, journalist, and novelist", "* John Hill (physician) (1931\u20131972), American plastic surgeon", "* John Hill (English cricketer) (1867\u20131963), English cricketer", "* John Hill (baseball) (1876\u20131922), American Negro leagues player", "* John Hill (Irish cricketer) (1912\u20131984), Irish cricketer", "* John Hill (New Zealand cricketer) (1930\u20132002), New Zealand cricketer", "* John Hill (Queensland cricketer) (born 1956), Australian cricketer", "*John Hill (Scottish footballer) (fl. 1891\u20131892), Scottish footballer", "*John Hill (rugby union) (fl. 1925), Australian rugby union player", "*John Hill (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1940s and 1950s", "*John Hill (American football) (1950\u20132018), American football player", "*John Hill (New Zealand footballer) (born 1950), Irish-born New Zealand footballer", "*John Hill (boat racer) (1933\u20131993), British powerboat racer", "*John Hill (wrestler) (1942\u20132010), Canadian wrestler", "*John Hill (ice hockey) (born 1960), American ice hockey coach", "* John Hill (classicist) (1747\u20131805), Scottish minister and classicist", "* John Hill (explorer) (c. 1810\u20131860), English explorer of South Australia", "* John Hill (bishop) (1862\u20131943), English clergyman, inaugural Suffragan Bishop of Hulme", "* John Hill (trade unionist) (1863\u20131945), British trade unionist", "* John Hill (police officer) (1914\u20132004), British HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales", "* John Hill, a character in Cheers", "*James John Hill (1811\u20131882), English painter", "*John Hill & Company, a former British toy company", "*John Hill House, a historic home in Erie, Pennsylvania", "*John Hills (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Victualling Commissioners", "response": ["* 1827-1832 Captain, John Hill"]}, {"page": "Deptford Dockyard", "response": ["* 1841\u20131851, Captain John Hill.
