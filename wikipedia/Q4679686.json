Sometimes nonviolence is passive, and other times it isn't. For example, if a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn. At times there is confusion and contradiction about nonviolence, harmlessness and passivity. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person.Adam Roberts, Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, Oxford University Press, 2009 pp. 3 and 13-20.", "*  Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, ed.

Brock's successor in 1964 was Theodore Roszak.Richard K. S. Taylor, Against the Bomb: the British Peace Movement, 1958-1965. Oxford University Press, 1988, pp. 118, 271. In the same year, a Caribbean Quaker and PN writer, Marion Glean, \"contributed to a series of statements by post-colonial activists on 'race' in the run-up to the 1964 election, published by Theodore Roszak, editor of Peace News.\"Kalbir Shukra, The Changing Pattern of Black Politics in Britain. Pluto Press, 1998, p. 20.Ron Ramdin, The Making of the Black Working Class, Gower, 1987, p. 418. After the election, Glean helped bring together several activists, including David Pitt, C. L. R. James and Ranjana Ash to form the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination. Throughout the 1960s, Peace News covered issues such as opposition to the Vietnam War and the Biafran issue in the Nigerian Civil War. The magazine's coverage of the Vietnam War was notable for its support for the protests of the Vietnamese Buddhists, who it argued could become a nonviolent \"Third Force\" independent of both the Saigon and Hanoi governments.Chester and Rigby, p. 19. Peace News also ran lengthy analysis of left-wing thinkers, including E.P. Thompson's two-part study of C. Wright Mills\"C. Wright Mills: The Responsible Craftsman\", Peace News 22 November 1963 and 29 November 1963.
