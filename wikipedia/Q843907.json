He turned professional in 2009, and made his senior debut the same year while on loan to Darlington of League Two. He spent time on loan at three other clubs in the lower leagues \u2013 Walsall and Chesterfield of League One and League Two Shrewsbury Town \u2013 as well as at Scottish Premier League side Inverness Caledonian Thistle, before making seven appearances for Wolves in the Premier League at the end of the 2011\u201312 season during their unsuccessful fight against relegation. Although playing fairly regularly in the Championship, he never established himself as a consistent member of the starting eleven as Wolves were again relegated. He fell out of favour the following season, and left for West Midlands neighbours Birmingham City in August 2014. He spent six-and-a-half years with the club, during which he made nearly 200 appearances in all competitions and was voted Birmingham's Player of the Year for 2016\u201317 before falling out of favour and spending time on loan at Charlton Athletic. He was released by mutual consent in January 2021 and joined Shrewsbury Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Davis", "response": ["*David Davis (broadcaster) (1908\u20131996), British radio executive and broadcaster, head of the BBC's Children's Hour", "*David Davis (TV producer) (born 1937), American television producer", "*David Davis (bluegrass) (born 1961), American mandolinist and singer", "*David Davis (Supreme Court justice) (1815\u20131886), American Supreme Court justice and U.S. Senator", "*David Davis IV (1906\u20131978), American lawyer and politician", "*David Davis (Tennessee politician) (born 1959), American politician, U.S. Representative from Tennessee", "*David Davis (New South Wales politician) (1854\u20131927), Australian politician, member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "*David Davis (lord mayor of Birmingham) (1859\u20131938), British politician, first Jewish lord mayor of Birmingham, England", "*David Davis (British politician) (born 1948), British Member of Parliament, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union", "*David Davis (Australian politician) (born 1962), Australian politician, member of the Victorian Legislative Council", "*David Davis (cricketer) (1902\u20131995), New Zealand cricketer and judge", "*David Davis (handballer) (born 1976), Spanish handball player", "*David Davis (footballer) (born 1991), English association football player", "*David Davis (Castellhywel) (1745\u20131827), Welsh minister and poet", "*David Davis, Blaengwawr, (1797-1866) Australian industrialist, leading figure in the South Wales coal industry", "*David Davis, Maesyffynnon (coal owner) (1821\u20131884), Australian industrialist, son of David Davis, Blaengwawr", "*David Davis Mansion, historic home in Bloomington, Illinois, U.S.", "*David Davis Walker (1840\u20131918), American merchant, a first cousin of Justice Davis"]}, {"page": "Clayton Donaldson", "response": ["Away to Wigan Athletic on 16 August 2016, Donaldson's penalty was saved, although the encroaching David Davis scored from the rebound to give Birmingham a lead they failed to protect. Two weeks later, he converted a penalty to open his account for the season before taking advantage of a defensive error to complete a 3\u20130 win over Norwich City. In the next match, Donaldson again missed a penalty, then ignored managerial orders that Jacques Maghoma should take any further spot kick and scored the winning goal from the penalty awarded after 49 minutes. After the match, Rowett confirmed that Donaldson would remain as designated taker, but advised him to practise. He duly scored from the spot in the very next match. Donaldson's sixth goal, again a penalty, came against Ipswich Town in December. He was stretchered off soon afterwards with an Achilles tendon injury which kept him out for three months, by which time the team were in a relegation battle under the management of Gianfranco Zola, who had taken over the day after the Ipswich match. He made four appearances, with only one start, before a knee injured in training forced him out until the last 20 minutes of the final match, away to Bristol City, in which he helped Birmingham defend a 1\u20130 lead to avoid relegation."]}, {"page": "Carl Ikeme", "response": ["Ikeme started the 2012\u201313 season as Wolves' first choice goalkeeper in the Championship following injuries to Hennessey and De Vries; he maintained his place in the first team when the latter returned in September 2012. In March 2013 he conceded a bizarre own goal during a league game against Bristol City, when he allowed a David Davis backpass to go between his legs and roll over the line. Ikeme was substituted at half time, and it was later confirmed that he had broken his hand during the interval by punching a tactics board in the dressing room in frustration at the incident. This injury kept him out for the remainder of the season, which ended in relegation to League One."]}, {"page": "Stephen Gleeson", "response": ["On 9 June, Gleeson signed a two-year contract with Championship club Birmingham City, to begin when his MK Dons contract expired at the end of the 2013\u201314 season. The Irish Independent Daniel McDonnell suggested he was one of several Irish players who needed to prove themselves in the coming season. He made his debut in the starting eleven for the opening-day defeat at Middlesbrough, but failed to establish himself in the team: of the twelve league matches under Lee Clark's management, he started five and came on as a substitute in five as Birmingham dropped towards the relegation places. Clark's successor, Gary Rowett, included Gleeson in his first starting eleven, playing in front of the defensive line in a goalless draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers. This time, Gleeson did keep his place, tasked with \"launching the counter-attacks\" from Rowett's preferred 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation as his \"effective midfield partnership\" with David Davis started 18 consecutive league matches. Gleeson was sent off for retaliation in February 2016 as Birmingham beat Brentford, and new loan signing Robert Tesche of Nottingham Forest took his place alongside Davis. He returned to the side after his suspension as part of a three-man midfield, but when Rowett reverted to 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, it was Gleeson's passing that earned him selection ahead of Davis as Tesche's partner."]}]}}
