He scored his only goal of the campaign, the second of his Gillingham career, in a 3\u20131 win over bottom-placed Stockport County in December 2009, marking his 100th appearance for the club with an \"angled volley\" that beat Owain F\u00f4n Williams in the Stockport goal. Gillingham were relegated at the end of the season, finishing in 21st place. A 3\u20130 away loss to one of Nutter's former employers, Wycombe Wanderers, cemented their fate. Nutter made 41 appearances during the campaign. Stimson left the club by mutual consent days after the Wycombe match, and was replaced by Andy Hessenthaler. This meant that Nutter would be playing under a manager other than Stimson for the first time in six years (aside from a three-week spell under Peter Taylor at Stevenage). Nutter's contract was extended for a further year in June 2010 after he had \"played sufficient games last season to trigger a new deal\". During the season, Nutter received the first red card of his career in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Dover Athletic in the FA Cup, earning the dismissal for a \"professional foul\". He made 37 appearances during the 2010\u201311 season, scoring once, as Gillingham narrowly missed out on a place in the play-offs. In May 2011, Nutter left Gillingham when his contract expired at the end of the month.
