She had no formal training in archaeology, but had worked as a secretary for Flinders Petrie for a number of years before being given a field assignment. Olga then went on to join James Leslie Starkey in the expedition to find Lachish in 1929 and remained part of the team for the following seasons.\nWhen Starkey was killed in 1938, the team finished the season then closed the site. Olga volunteered to write up the report of the dig and spent the following twenty years researching and writing up the majority of the excavation report. Olga's work has been regarded as the \"pre-eminent source book for Palestinian archeology\". Once the report was published, she turned her attention to cataloguing scarabs and other seals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Merneferre Ay", "response": ["Merneferre Ay is well attested; no fewer than 62 scarab seals and one cylinder-sealCylinder Seal of King Merneferre Aya, Metropolitan Museum of Art, see the online catalog  bearing his name are known, 51 of which are of unknown provenanceFive scarab-seals of Merneferre Ay are now in the Petrie Museum, see three of them on Digital EgyptOlga Tufnell: Studies on Scarab Seals, vol.

They succeeded in finding Lachish, with a \"wealth of well-stratified pottery\", a \"key part of the ceramic corpus of Palestine\", and the Lachish Letters, c. \"written to the commander of the garrison at Lachish shortly before it fell to the Babylonians in either 589 or 586 B.C.\" Starkey was murdered in 1938 while travelling to Jerusalem to open the Rockefeller Archaeological Museum.

Other findings include an ancient Canaanite city, which experienced a catastrophic fire in the sometime in the 13th century BCE. The date and causes of the violent destruction of Canaanite Hazor have been an important issue ever since the first excavations of the site. One school of thought, represented by Yigael Yadin, Yohanan Aharoni and Amnon Ben-Tor, dates the destruction to the later half of the 13th century, tying it to biblical descriptions in Joshua which hold the Israelites responsible for the event. The second school of thought, represented by Olga Tufnell, Kathleen Kenyon, P. Beck, Moshe Kochavi and Israel Finkelstein, tends to support an earlier date in the first half of the 13th century, in which case there is no necessary connection between the destruction of Hazor and the process of settlement by Israelite Tribes in Cannan.
