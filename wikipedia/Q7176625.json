Both opening batsmen, Mike Denness and Brian Luckhurst scored half-centuries to help them score 193 runs. They were bowled out with two balls of their innings remaining; Roy Palmer and Bill Alley took three wickets each for Somerset. When Somerset batted, a few players made good starts, but none managed to make half-centuries or above. Peter Robinson achieved their highest score, with 48 runs. The county were eventually dismissed for 161, granting Kent victory by 32 runs. The victory was the start of a successful period of cricket for Kent, who won eleven trophies between 1967 and 1979.", "In Somerset's batting innings, Woodcock suggested that the team needed just one top-class performance to grant them victory after restricting Kent's score well late in their innings. Peter Robinson, opening with Roy Virgin, played well to score 48 runs, but that was the highest score that any Somerset player would manage. Each of the other top-order batsmen made starts, but none could convert them to big scores; Virgin got 17, Mervyn Kitchen 15 and Terry Barwell 24. Alley, identified by The Times as a key player for Somerset before the match, only scored one run before being caught behind square on the legside by Brown from the bowling of Shepherd. Graham Burgess provided some runs in the middle-order, but lacked support from his batting partners; of the five batsmen who were below him in the batting order, only Geoff Clayton added more than two runs to the score, and he only totalled eight. Derek Underwood finished as Kent's leading wicket-taker in the match, though his three wickets came late in the innings, as he had been held back against the top-order, as Cowdrey was concerned he might concede too many runs. Somerset were all out for 161 runs, with 54.5 overs bowled, giving Kent a 32-run victory.", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Peter Robinson b Ken Palmer || 1", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Peter Robinson "]}]}}
