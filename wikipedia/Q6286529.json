The most notable proponents of workers' co-operatives are, in Britain, the Christian Socialists, and later writers like Joseph Reeves who put this forth as a path to State Socialism.Reeves, Joseph, \u201cA Century of Rochdale Cooperation 1844-1944\u201d, London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1944. Where the Co-operative Federalists argue for federations in which consumer co-operators federate and receive the monetary dividends, rather, in co-operative wholesale societies the profits (or surpluses) would be paid as dividends to their workers. The Mondrag\u00f3n Co-operatives in Spain are commonly cited by Co-operative Individualists and a lot of Co-operative Individualist literature deals with these societies. The Mondrag\u00f3n Cooperative Corporation has drawn so much attention because in 2010 it was the seventh-largest company in Spain. It consists of about 250 different worker cooperative businesses. The business model they use includes \"extensive integration and solidarity with employees\", worker involvement in policy and committees, a \"transparent\" wage system, and \"full practice of democratic control\". These two schools of thought are not necessarily in opposition, and hybrids of the two positions are possible."]}, {"page": "Reeves, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Reeves"]}]}}
