Soranus was also a friend of Varro and is mentioned more than once in that scholar's multi-volume work on the Latin language.Marcus Terentius Varro, De lingua latina 7.31, 7.65, 10.70; Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae 2.10.3; Edward Courtney, The Fragmentary Latin Poets (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), p. 65.", "Cicero presents the Valerii brothers of Sora as well schooled in Greek and Latin literature, but less admirable for their speaking ability.Cicero, Brutus 169: non tam in dicendo admirabilis quam doctus et Graecis litteris et Latinis.

This attitude of social exclusivity may account for why Valerius Soranus, whose scholarly interests and friendships might otherwise suggest a conservative temperament, would have found his place in the civil wars of the 80s on the side of the popularist Marius rather than that of the patrician Sulla.John Pairman Brown, Israel and Hellas, vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), pp. 249\u2013250. It might also be noted that Cicero's expression of this attitude is double-edged: like Marius and the Valerii Sorani, he was also a man from a municipium, and had to overcome the same obstructing biases that he adopts and expresses.Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 34 et passim.", "Servius's account presents several difficulties.

Finally, it is unclear whether the ten tribunes should possess the knowledge of Rome's secret name,\u201cThis name and the name of the tutelary deity of Rome had to be handed down from one generation of Roman priests and magistrates to the succeeding one\u201d: Jerzy Linderski, \"The Augural Law,\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r\u00f6mischen Welt II 16.3 (1986), p. 2255, note 424. The story of Valerius Soranus, Linderski assumes, indicates that tribunes knew the name; the reasoning may be circular. or in what manner Soranus would have publicized it. Among sources earlier than Servius, both Pliny the Elder and Plutarch note that Valerius Soranus was punished for this violation.Pliny the Elder, Historia naturalis 3.65; Plutarch, Roman Questions 61. The late antique grammarian Solinus (1.4) also reports that Valerius Soranus was killed for profaning the name of Rome, connecting the act to the Roman goddess Angerona, whose cult statue depicted her with a sealed mouth. It has been suggested that the name was revealed in his one work for which a title is known, the Epoptides. The title, if interpreted as it sometimes is to mean \"tutelary deities,\" offers an apt context.Thomas K\u00f6ves-Zulauf, \"Die \u1f18\u03c0\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 des Valerius Soranus,\" Rheinisches Museum 113 (1970) 323-358. \"Tutelary deities\" is not the universal translation: see discussion under Literary Works. But elsewhere Servius \u2014 so too Macrobius \u2014 implies that the name remained unrecorded.Servius, Commentary on the Aeneid 1.277; Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.9; John Pairman Brown, Israel and Hellas, vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), p. 250. The ancient sources on the violation make a distinction without, in the outcome for Soranus, a difference; some say the arcanum not to be revealed was the secret name of Rome, and others that of Rome's tutelary deity, see L'identit\u00e0 segreta della divinit\u00e0 tutelare di Roma. Un riesame dell' affaire Sorano. Roma, Settimo Sigillo, 2011.", "But if Varro originated the story, his reasons are hard to tease out of the roiled politics of the Late Republic. Although Varro was the friend of Valerius Soranus, in the civil war of the 40s he was on the side of the Pompeians; Caesar, however, not only pardoned him, but gave him significant appointments.For the development of the story of Valerius Soranus as a cautionary tale, see Trevor Murphy, \u201cPrivileged Knowledge: Valerius Soranus and the Secret Name of Rome,\u201d in Rituals in Ink: A Conference on Religion and Literary Production in Ancient Rome (Stuttgart 2004), pp. 127\u2013137. The biases of the contemporary sources were not lost on Plutarch in his account of the killing:Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 105.", "Speaking the name could be construed as a political protest and also an act of treason, as the revelation would expose the tutelary deity and leave the city unprotected.John Pairman Brown, Israel and Hellas, vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), p. 250, citing Luigi Alfonsi, \"L'importanza politico-religiosa della 'enunciazione' de Valerio Sorano,\" Epigraphica 10 (1948) 81\u201389. This belief rests on the power of utterance to \"call forth\" the deity (evocatio), so that enemies in possession of the true and secret name could divert the divine protection to themselves.Pliny says that the Romans practiced evocatio when they laid siege to a city, with the priests calling out the foreign god and promising him a greater cult among them (Historia naturalis 28.18). Macrobius even provides the charm of evocation used against Carthage (Saturnalia 3.9). The secrecy surrounding prayer formularies, particularly the correct names of gods, was characteristic also of Judaism, Egyptian syncretistic religion, mystery religions, and later Christianity. See Matthias Klinghardt, \u201cPrayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion,\u201d Numen 46 (1999) 1\u201352, pp. 43\u201344 on this case; also article on \"Magic and Religion: The Name of God.\" The intellectual historian of the Republic Elizabeth Rawson ventured cautiously that Soranus's \"motive remains unclear, but may have been political.\"Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 300, note 12. More vigorous is the view of Luigi Alfonsi, who argued that Soranus revealed the name deliberately so that the Italian municipalities could appropriate it and break Rome's monopoly of power.Luigi Alfonsi, \"L'importanza politico-religiosa della enunciazione di Valerio Sorano (a proposito di CIL I\u00b2 337).\" Epigraphica 10 (1948) 81-89.", "The syntax poses difficulties in attempts at translation, and there may be some corruption of the text. It seems to say something like \"Jupiter All-powerful, of kings and the material world and of gods the Father (progenitor), the Mother (genetrix) of gods, God that is One and All \u2026 .\" Augustine says that his source for the quotation is a work on religion (now lost) by Varro, with whose conception of deity Augustine argues throughout Book 7 of the De civitate Dei. The view of Varro, and presumably of Soranus, was that Jupiter represents the whole universe which emits and receives seeds (semina), encompassing the generative powers of Earth the Mother as well as Sky the Father.Robert M. Grant, review of Varros Logistoricus \u00fcber die G\u00f6tterverehrung (\"Curio de cultu deorum\"), dissertation by Burkhart Cardauns (W\u00fcrzburg 1960) in Classical Philology 57 (1962), p. 140; Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 300, especially note 12; Jaime Alvar, \"Mat\u00e9riaux pour l'\u00e9tude de la formule sive deus, sive dea,\" Numen 32 (1985), pp. 259\u2013260. This unitarianism is a Stoic concept, and Soranus is usually counted among the Stoics of Rome, perhaps of the contemporary school of Panaetius.Eduard Zeller, A History of Eclecticism in Greek 'Philos', translated by S.F. Alleyne (Kessinger, 2006, originally published 1883), p. 74; Michael von Albrecht et al., A History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius, vol. 1 (Brill, 1997), p. 504, translated from Geschichte der r\u00f6mischen Literatur: von Andronicus bis Boethius (1992). The unity of opposites in deity, including divine androgyny, is also characteristic of Orphic doctrine, which may have impressed itself on Stoicism.Edward Courtney, The Fragmentary Latin Poets (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 66\u201368; Attilio Mastrocinque, \"Creating One's Own Religion: Intellectual Choices,\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 382, pointing out that the Hymn to Zeus of Cleanthes presents a similar view of the god, and that Laevius, a likely contemporary of Valerius Soranus, held that Venus was both female and male (according to Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.8.3). Marcello De Martino, in L'identit\u00e0 segreta della divinit\u00e0 tutelare di Roma. Un riesame dell' affaire Sorano. Roma, Settimo Sigillo, 2011, believes that Sorano revealed the name of Roman tutelar deity, who was androgynous.", "The couplet may or may not come from the Epoptides. The title is mentioned only in Pliny, and none of the known fragments of Soranus can be attributed to this large-scale work with certainty.Nicholas Horsfall, \u201cRoman Religion and Related Topics,\u201d review of Thomas K\u00f6ves-Zulauf, Kleine Schriften (Heidelberg 1988), Classical Review 41 (1991) 120-122. Soranus's innovation in providing a table of contentsAn innovation admired by Pliny the Elder, preface 33, Historia naturalis. \u2014 most likely a list of capita rerum (\"subject headings\")  at the beginning \u2014 suggests that the Epoptides was an encyclopedic or compendious prose work.Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 51; John Henderson, \u201cKnowing Someone Through Their Books: Pliny on Uncle Pliny (Epistles 3.5),\u201d Classical Philology 97 (2002), p. 275. Alternatively, the Epoptides may have been a long didactic poem. Soranus is known to have written didactic poetry and is likely to have been an influence when Lucretius chose verse as his medium for philosophical subject matter.C.

Much of what can be conjectured about the work derives from the interpretation of its title. The Greek verb \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9 (epopteuo) has the basic meaning of \"to watch, oversee\" but also \"to become an \u1f10\u03c0\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (epoptes, \"initiate,\" feminine epoptis and plural epoptides), the highest grade of initiate at the Eleusinian mysteries.Liddell and Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1843, 1985 printing), entry on \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 and related words, p. 676; Trevor Murphy, \u201cPrivileged Knowledge: Valerius Soranus and the Secret Name of Rome,\u201d in Rituals in Ink (Stuttgart 2004), p. 133. K\u00f6ves-Zulauf argued that Soranus's Epoptides was an extended treatment of mystery religions, and the title is sometimes translated into German as Mystikerinnen. The classicist and mythographer H.J. Rose, on the contrary, insisted that the Epoptides had nothing to do with initiates.H.J. Rose, \u201cLatin Literature for Italian Children,\u201d Classical Review 51 (1937) p. 229.

The achievements of Publius, named after his grandfather (consul in 97 BC) and uncle, eclipse those of his brother to such an extent that some have questioned the traditional birth order.G.V.

Although his poor remuneration is noted as evidence of Crassus's parsimony,Plutarch, Crassus 3.3; Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 81. it has been suggested that in failing to enrich himself at Crassus's expense Alexander asserted a positive philosophical stance disregarding material possessions.This was the view of Robert Burton in The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 1, section 2, p. 206 in the edition of Chatto and Windus (London, 1881). The Peripatetics of the time differed little from the Old Academy represented by Antiochus of Ascalon, who placed emphasis on knowledge as the supreme value and on the Aristotelian conception of human beings as by nature political (a z\u014don politikon, \"creature of politics\"). This view of man as a \"political animal\" would have been congenial to the family political dynamism of the Licinii Crassi.Miriam Griffin, \"Philosophy, Politics, and Politicians at Rome,\" in Philosophia togata: Essays on Philosophy and Roman Society (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), passim, including citations from Cicero.", "Little else is known about Publius's philosophical predispositions or political sympathies. Despite his active support on behalf of his father in the elections for 55 BC and his ties to Caesar, he admired and was loyal to Cicero and played a mediating role between Cicero and the elder Crassus, who was often at odds with the outspoken orator.Eve J. Parrish, \"Crassus' New Friends and Pompey's Return,\" Phoenix 27 (1973), p. 371, citing Cicero, Ad familiares 5.8.4 and 13.16.21; Ad Quintum fratrem 2.7.2; and Brutus 280\u2013282. In his friendship with Cicero, Publius showed a degree of political independence. Cicero seems to have hoped that he could steer the talented young man away from a popularist and militarist path toward the example of his consular grandfather, whose political career was traditional and moderate, or toward modeling himself after the orator Licinius Crassus about whom Cicero so often wrote.Elizabeth Rawson, \u201cCrassorum funera,\u201d Latomus 41 (1982), pp. 542 and 546; see Cicero, Brutus 282. Cicero almost always speaks of young Crassus with approval and affection, criticizing only his impatient ambition.Rawson, \"Crassorum funera,\" pp. 542\u2013543, citing D.R. Shackleton Bailey in his note to Ad fam. 13.16.1, as having introduced the question of whether Publius's ambition was the main impetus for the war against Parthia.", "The notoriously wealthy Marcus Crassus was around sixty and hearing-impairedCicero, Tusculan Disputations 4.40 (= 116), as cited by Rawson, \"Crassorum funera,\" p. 541. when he embarked on the Parthian invasion.

Elizabeth Rawson, however, suggested that in addition to these or other practical objectives, the war was meant to provide an arena for Publius's abilities as a general, which he had begun to demonstrate so vividly in Gaul.Rawson, \"Crassorum funera,\" passim; see also article Battle of Carrhae, discussion under Political background in Rome. Cicero implies as much when he enumerates Publius's many fine qualities (see above) and then mourns and criticizes his young friend's destructive desire for gloria:", "The civil war between Caesar and Pompeius is often said to have been made inevitable by the deaths of two people: Caesar's daughter Julia, whose political marriage to Pompeius surprised Roman social circles by its affection; and Marcus Crassus, whose political influence and wealth had been a counterweight to the two greater militarists. It would be idle to speculate on what role Publius Crassus might have played either in the civil war or during Caesar's resulting dictatorship. In many ways, his career follows a course similar to the early life of Decimus Brutus, whose role in the assassination of Caesar was far from foreseeable.Ronald Syme, Sallust (University of California Press, 1964, reprinted 2002), p. 40 online, \u201cThe Sons of Crassus\u201d reprint p. 1223, \u201cMarriage Ages for Roman Senators\u201d p. 325; Matthew B. Roller, Constructing Autocracy: Aristocrats and Emperors in Julio-Claudian Rome (Princeton University Press, 2001), p. 177 online. Elizabeth Rawson concludes:", "A lost biography of Publius Crassus was written by his Greek secretary Apollonius, who accompanied him on the Parthian campaign but presumably escaped with Cassius. Eight years after the battle, Cicero wrote a letter of recommendation to Caesar on behalf of Apollonius, praising him for his loyalty.Cicero, Ad familiares 13.16. Since he was manumitted as a term of Publius's will, he is by Roman custom likely to have taken the name Publius Licinius Apollonius as a freedman. The highly laudatory account of Publius's death found in Plutarch suggests that Apollonius's biography was a source.For the available evidence on Apollonius, see Andrew Lintott, \u201cA Historian in Cicero: Ad familiares \u2013 P.
