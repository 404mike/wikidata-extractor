As well as doing the regular afternoons service, in the summer of '89, they also had to provide a mornings service too, which was a rival to But... First This! on Children's BBC. Downs & radio presenter Clive Warren were both hired to present the mornings service, which ran from 9:25am to 12:30pm on weekdays throughout July and August. Also, the puppet character Scally the Dog often appeared in the mornings with them too. Additionally during this time, they both took separate turns as stand-ins for fellow Children's ITV presenter Jerry Foulkes in the afternoons, when he was away on holiday."]}]}}
