In 1979, initiated by Sir John Hegarty of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the Student Awards were launched. Bridging the gap between college and work, the awards present students with real world briefs to tackle. The awards had already started to recognise a wider range of categories through the 1960s and 1970s and photography, retail design (now environmental design), music videos, and product design became part of the awards in the 1980s. The awards also opened up to international entries for the first time in 1988. Controversy surrounded a decision to hold separate advertising and design awards in 1986 and 1987; the separation, made for practical reasons based on the chosen venue, was seen by members as a split between industries.

An advertising executive Dave Trott heard the duo performed \"Woortcha!\" in a pub in the East End in 1978, and decided to use the song for a series of adverts for Courage bitter.  The original version in One Fing 'n' Anuvver was slower, and Chas & Dave recorded a short version at a faster tempo so that it may fit into the adverts.  The advert was released in early 1979 and became popular, the record label EMI then requested a faster version of the song so that it may be released as a single. The duo re-recorded the song at Portland Studios in London, and the faster version was released as \"Gertcha\" early May 1979. The song is included in the album Don't Give a Monkey's."]}, {"page": "David Trott", "response": ["David Trott or Dave Trott could refer to: ", "*Dave Trott (politician) (born 1960), American politician", "*Dave Trott (advertising executive) (born 1947), English copywriter"]}]}}
