A Sinn F\u00e9in organiser of the time in Belfast described the party's role as \"agitation and publicity\".

In the words of Brian Feeney, \"\u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh would use Sinn F\u00e9in ard fheiseanna (party conferences) to announce republican policy, which was, in effect, IRA policy, namely that Britain should leave the North or the 'war' would continue\".Feeney, p. 272. Sinn F\u00e9in was given a concrete presence in the community when the IRA declared a ceasefire in 1975. 'Incident centres' were set up to communicate potential confrontations to the British authorities.

After his death on hunger strike, his seat was held, with an increased vote, by his election agent, Owen Carron. Two other Anti H-Block candidates were elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in the general election in the Republic.

The party narrowly missed winning additional seats in Belfast North and Fermanagh and South Tyrone. In the 1983 UK general election eight months later, Sinn F\u00e9in increased its support, breaking the six-figure vote barrier in Northern Ireland for the first time by polling 102,701 votes (13.4%). Gerry Adams won the Belfast West constituency, and Danny Morrison fell only 78 votes short of victory in Mid Ulster.", "The 1984 European elections proved to be a disappointment, with Sinn F\u00e9in's candidate Danny Morrison polling 91,476 (13.3%) and falling well behind the SDLP candidate John Hume.", "In the 1989 European election, Danny Morrison again failed to win a seat, polling at 48,914 votes (9%)."]}, {"page": "Gerry Adams", "response": ["In Long Kesh in the mid-1970s, writing under the pseudonym \"Brownie\" in Republican News, Adams called for increased political activity among republicans, especially at local level. The call resonated with younger Northern people, many of whom had been active in the Provisional IRA but few of whom had been active in Sinn F\u00e9in. In 1977, Adams and Danny Morrison drafted the address of Jimmy Drumm at the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown. The address was viewed as watershed in that Drumm acknowledged that the war would be a long one and that success depended on political activity that would complement the IRA's armed campaign. For some, this wedding of politics and armed struggle culminated in Danny Morrison's statement at the 1981 Sinn F\u00e9in Ard Fheis in which he asked \"Who here really believes we can win the war through the ballot box? But will anyone here object if, with a ballot paper in one hand and the Armalite in the other, we take power in Ireland?\" For others, however, the call to link political activity with armed struggle had already been defined in Sinn F\u00e9in policy and in the presidential addresses of Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, but this had not resonated with young Northerners.Robert White, Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, pp. 258\u201359.", "Even after the election of Bobby Sands as MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, a part of the mass mobilisation associated with the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike by republican prisoners in the H blocks of the Maze Prison (known as Long Kesh by republicans), Adams was cautious that the level of political involvement by Sinn F\u00e9in could lead to electoral embarrassment. Charles Haughey, the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland, called an election for June 1981. At an Ard Chomhairle meeting, Adams recommended that they contest only four constituencies which were in border counties. Instead, H-Block/Armagh candidates contested nine constituencies and elected two TDs. This, along with the election of Sands, was a precursor to an electoral breakthrough in elections in 1982 to the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly. Adams, Danny Morrison, Martin McGuinness, Jim McAllister, and Owen Carron were elected as abstentionists. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had announced before the election that it would not take any seats and so its 14 elected representatives also abstained from participating in the Assembly and it was a failure. The 1982 election was followed by the 1983 Westminster election, in which Sinn F\u00e9in's vote increased and Adams was elected, as an abstentionist, as MP for Belfast West. It was in 1983 that Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh resigned as President of Sinn F\u00e9in and was succeeded by Adams.", "Adams' leadership of Sinn F\u00e9in was supported by a Northern-based cadre that included people like Danny Morrison and Martin McGuinness. Over time, Adams and others pointed to republican electoral successes in the early and mid-1980s, when hunger strikers Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty were elected to the British House of Commons and D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann respectively, and they advocated that Sinn F\u00e9in become increasingly political and base its influence on electoral politics rather than paramilitarism. The electoral effects of this strategy were shown later by the election of Adams and McGuinness to the House of Commons."]}, {"page": "Martin McGuinness", "response": ["After his release, and another conviction in the Republic of Ireland for IRA membership in 1974, he became increasingly prominent in Sinn F\u00e9in, the political wing of the republican movement.

Both sides were initially involved in an armed campaign against the British state, but the Officials gradually moved into mainstream politics after the Official IRA ceasefire of 1972; the associated \"Official Sinn F\u00e9in\" eventually renamed itself the Workers' Party. The Provisional IRA, except during brief ceasefires in 1972 and 1975, kept up a campaign of violence for nearly thirty years, directed against security forces and civilian targets (especially businesses). While the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) represented the nationalists of Northern Ireland in initiatives such as the 1973 Sunningdale Agreement, republicans took no part in these, believing that a withdrawal of British troops and a commitment to a united Ireland was a necessary precondition of any settlement. This began to change with a landmark speech by Danny Morrison in 1981, advocating what became known as the Armalite and ballot box strategy. Under the leadership of Gerry Adams, Sinn F\u00e9in began to focus on the search for a political settlement. When the party voted in 1986 to take seats in legislative bodies within Ireland, there was a walk-out of die-hard republicans, who set up Republican Sinn F\u00e9in and the Continuity IRA. Following the Hume\u2013Adams dialogue, Sinn F\u00e9in took part in the Northern Ireland peace process which led to the IRA ceasefires of 1994 and 1997 and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. After elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, republicans sat in government in Northern Ireland for the first time when Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Br\u00fan were elected to the Northern Ireland Executive. However, another split occurred, with anti-Agreement republicans setting up the 32 County Sovereignty Movement and the Real IRA. Today, Irish republicanism is divided between those who support the institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement and the later St Andrews Agreement, and those who oppose them. The latter are often referred to as dissident republicans."]}, {"page": "1981 Irish hunger strike", "response": ["In January 1981, it became clear that the prisoners' demands had not been conceded.
