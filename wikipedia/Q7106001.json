Southampton won the game 3\u20131, meaning they moved above the home side in the league table. The game was an exciting encounter all-round, with Finnish teenage striker Lauri Dalla Valle, on loan from Fulham, opening the scoring for Bournemouth in the 6th minutes, despite Southampton players' protests of offside. Just five minutes later however, it was all level again when Lee Barnard's header was fumbled by the Bournemouth defence and found its way into the net for 1\u20131. In the second half, Southampton took the lead thanks to a goal from captain Dean Hammond, and top scorer Rickie Lambert assured the win in the 88th minute with a solo effort. In injury time, Oscar Gobern received a red card, but Southampton cruised to victory to move up to 4th place in the table once again. Southampton picked up a fourth league win in a row on 19 March, beating Sheffield Wednesday 2\u20130 in a late kick-off. Despite a number of good chances for the Saints in the opening 45 minutes, it took until 15 minutes into the second half for defender Jos\u00e9 Fonte to break the deadlock, heading in an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain corner. With the team in full flow now, Rickie Lambert scored his 17th goal of the season just six minutes later to make it two for Southampton and secure the win. It could have been more though, with Adam Lallana hitting the post shortly after Lambert's goal and a great performance from Wednesday goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell denying further opportunities from Oxlade-Chamberlain and others.", "Southampton faced Brighton on 23 April, and after trailing for most of the game managed to beat the new League One champions 2\u20131. The first half was evenly matched, with the Saints maybe edging the home side out slightly, but it was Brighton who broke the deadlock just before half time thanks to a goal from Ashley Barnes following an incident of miscommunication between Radhi Ja\u00efdi and Kelvin Davis. It took until the 84th minute for the Saints to equalise, and the goal came from substitute David Connolly, who had been on the pitch for less than ten minutes. Just five minutes later, in the last minute of normal time, Jos\u00e9 Fonte headed in a cross from Dean Hammond to put the visitors ahead and secure the three points. The Saints increased the pressure on Huddersfield by beating Hartlepool United 2\u20130 two days later. The first half was dominated by the home side, with a goal from Guly do Prado being disallowed for offside. Rickie Lambert opened the scoring in the second half with a penalty following a foul by defender Sam Collins which saw the visitors go down to ten men. Jos\u00e9 Fonte doubled the lead in the 82nd minute to secure the win and keep Southampton in the second automatic promotion place. Southampton beat Brentford 3\u20130 on 30 April to put them one win away from promotion. The Saints dominated from start to finish, with goals coming from Adam Lallana in the 16th minute, David Conolly on the half-hour mark, and Oscar Gobern in the first minute of added time at the end of the match.", "The draw for the Second Round took place on 7 November at 14:00 GMT, and gave Southampton a home tie against League Two side Cheltenham Town to be played on 27 November.

The game saw the first starts of the season for winger Lee Holmes, midfielder Oscar Gobern in the absence of Morgan Schneiderlin and Richard Chaplow, and goalkeeper Bartosz Bia\u0142kowski, and goals came from Adam Lallana, Guly do Prado and Gobern, who also had a goal disallowed in the second half.
