Mote), pp.66\u201367.", "While the \"general\" way for an overarm bowler to spin the ball is from off to leg (i.e., an off-break), the opposite was true for the underarm bowlers and Lamborn was thus one of bowling's great innovators.

Until the 1760s, bowlers had always rolled or skimmed the ball towards the batsman so spin bowling itself was a new skill.

The \"East Kent\" team, Mann's XI, included John Small, Richard Aubrey Veck and Lamborn of Hambledon and Hampshire.
