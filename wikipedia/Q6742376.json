He was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium and made his first-class debut for Hampshire County Cricket Club in the 1954 County Championship against Leicestershire.\nHeath played for Hampshire in 143 first-class matches from 1954 to 1962, with his final appearance for the county coming in 1962 against Derbyshire at the United Services Recreation Ground at Portsmouth. In his 143 matches for the county, Heath scored 569 runs at a batting average of 5.86, with a high score of 33. Heath, being a bowler, took 527 wickets at a bowling average of 25.11, with 18 five wicket hauls and 5 ten wicket hauls in a match, with best bowling figures of 8/43 against Sussex in 1958. The 1958 season was Heath's best with the ball, during which he took 126 wickets at an average of 16.42, with 10 five wicket hauls and 3 ten wicket hauls in a match. In addition, Heath played an important role in Hampshire's 1961 County Championship winning squad, taking 63 wickets at an average of 26.73, with one five wicket haul of 5-78. Throughout his career, Heath took 42 catches in the field. Heath later represented Scarborough Cricket Club, and had a coaching role at Lord's.\nIn 1969 Heath made a one-off appearance for the Marylebone Cricket Club in a non first-class match against Ireland at Lord's, taking a single wicket in the match.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The following years were mixed: a rise to second in 1958 with Malcolm Heath replacing Cannings as Shackleton's partner was followed by two disappointing years before Hampshire won the 1961 County Championship, their first ever County Championship success, finishing the season with 268 points, 18 ahead of Yorkshire. Hampshire won 19 of their 32 matches, losing only seven matches all season. The club were led by Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie with Marshall scoring the most runs for the club with 2,455.

The record attendance for a county match was made in 1948, when 10,000 watched Hampshire played Sussex. Hampshire continued to play four matches per season there going into the 1950s.  It was during this time that under the leadership of Desmond Eagar and Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie that the Hampshire team was beginning to become a powerful force in the county game.  Coupled with the batting of Roy Marshall (who in five matches there in 1957 scored 549, an unbeaten record for the ground), Jimmy Gray and Henry Horton, and backed up with the bowling of Derek Shackleton, Victor Cannings and Malcolm Heath, Hampshire had a fairly successful period, finishing runners-up in 1958, before winning the County Championship for the first time in 1961, with Hampshire winning four of their five matches there in that season.  They might have been successful in 1958, had it not been for two draws later in the season at the ground. A new format, List A cricket, was introduced in 1963, two years after its introduction, the ground held its first List A match when Hampshire played Kent in the 1965 Gillette Cup. Six first-class matches had been held there in 1962, before the schedule at the ground was reduced back to five, with the expansion of List A cricket with the Player's County League and John Player League, on average two or three List A matches were held there over the coming seasons. Hampshire were pressing for the Player's County League title in 1969, with a crowd of 8,000 watching their defeat to Essex. Hampshire finished that season's competition one point behind winners Lancashire.  A first-class match in 1971 between Hampshire and the touring Pakistanis saw protests by Bangladeshis protesting Pakistani actions in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time in 1973, though the 1970s saw a gradual reduction in the number of first-class matches held there, by the end of that decade three first-class matches and two List A matches were granted to the ground each season. This decade also saw logistical problems for the ground, when at the Railway End trees were destroyed, whose removal interrupted the batsman line of sight.  As such, no matches were held there in 1975, though the purchase of screens allowed county cricket to return in 1976.  1976 was also not without its problems, when a County Championship match against Yorkshire was interrupted by vandals who had attacked the pitch during the night.  Despite this setback, the match continued on an adjoining strip of pitch.", "* Best bowling in a match: 13\u201386 by Malcolm Heath for Hampshire v Sussex, 1958"]}, {"page": "Colin Roper", "response": ["Roper made a single first-class appearance for Hampshire against Oxford University at the University Parks in 1957.

This solution is put forth by classicist Malcolm Heath (not to be confused with English cricketer Malcolm Heath).Heath, Malcolm (2008) \"The Best Kind of Tragic Plot: Aristotle\u2019s argument in Poetics 13-14\" Anais de Filosofia Cl\u00e1ssica, vol. 2 No. 3, 2008Heath, Malcolm. \u201cAristotle on the Best Kind of Tragic Plot: Re-reading Poetics 13\u201314,\u201d 334-351. In: William Wians and Ron Polansky (eds.) Reading Aristotle: Argument and Exposition.  Series: Philosophia Antiqua, Volume: 146.  Leiden/Boston/Paderborn/Singapore: Brill, July 2017. Toward the end of Poetics chapter 13, Aristotle mentions that Euripides stands out among tragedians because \"so many of his tragedies end in misfortune.\" Aristotle then states that \"this is, as was earlier said, correct\" (1453a25-26).  Malcolm Heath finds that this praise of ending in misfortune is meant to justify a single plot over a double one.  As Elsa Bouchard writes, \"According to Heath, the prescriptions of chapter 13 are to be understood as essentially preliminary and polemic: they are above all intended to refute the partisans of the double plot,\"Bouchard 2012, 192 i.e., the plot in which a good man is saved and a bad man is punished or dies.  In other words, as Heath explains, ending in misfortune means the ending has only one quality, fitting one individual.Heath 2008 17, 2012 92 Consequently, according to Heath, the contradiction between chapters 13 and 14 is removed.  Bouchard also accounts for Heath's explanation of chapter 14: \"The reason Heath gives to explain [the] preference rests on the idea of technical purity: plays like Iphigenia in Tauris are devoid of acts of violence (pathos) and thus of the kind of sensational spectacle that Aristotle condemns at the beginning of chapter 14: 'Reliance on visual effect therefore becomes impossible in a plot of averted violence: the poet has to rely on the structure of the plot to achieve tragic effect.'\"Bouchard 2012, 192Heath 2008 14\u201315"]}]}}
