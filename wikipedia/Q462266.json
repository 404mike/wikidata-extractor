Valerie Martin's 2003 award saw her novel sales increase tenfold after the award, and British libraries, who often support the prize with various promotions, reported success in introducing people to new authors: \"48% said that they had tried new writers as a result of the promotion, and 42% said that they would try other books by the new authors they had read.\"", "No woman has won the award more than once but Margaret Atwood has been nominated three times without a win. Hilary Mantel was shortlisted three times without winning, for Beyond Black (2005) and the first two novels in her Tudor trilogy, Wolf Hall (2009) and Bring Up The Bodies (2012) which both won the Booker Prize. The third book in the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, was shortlisted in April 2020, a year in which the award (usually given in May) was postponed to September.
