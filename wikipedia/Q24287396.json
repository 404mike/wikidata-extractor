The 49er is a two-handed skiff-type sailing dinghy with high performance, and the 49erFX is a version designed for a lighter crew (120 kg). It has the same hull, wings, and foils as the 49er but the mast is shorter and the mainsail, jib and gennaker are smaller and lighter. This lowers the centre of gravity and makes the boat easier to sail while improving the overall performance. At the 2014 49er European Championships, held in Helsinki, Finland, the pair managed a sixth place."]}, {"page": "Saskia Tidey", "response": ["On 1 October, the British Olympic Association confirmed that Tidey had been selected to represent Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics in the 49er FX Skiff class alongside Charlotte Dobson.
