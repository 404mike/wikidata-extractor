He was the second officer on board the RMS Titanic and the most senior member of the crew to survive the Titanic disaster. As the officer in charge of loading passengers into lifeboats on the port side, Lightoller strictly enforced the women and children only protocol, not allowing any male passengers to board the lifeboats unless they were needed as auxiliary seamen. Lightoller served as a commanding officer in the Royal Navy during World War I and was twice decorated for gallantry. During World War II, in retirement, he provided and sailed as a volunteer on one of the \"little ships\" that played a part in the Dunkirk evacuation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 8", "response": ["*1952 \u2013 Charles Lightoller, English sailor (b. 1874)"]}, {"page": "March 30", "response": ["*1874 \u2013 Charles Lightoller, English 2nd officer on the RMS Titanic (d. 1952)"]}, {"page": "1952", "response": ["* December 8 \u2013 Charles Lightoller, British merchant marine officer, second officer of RMS Titanic (b. 1874)"]}, {"page": "Titanic (1997 film)", "response": ["* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller.

MacQuitty had actually seen Titanic being launched on 31 May 1911 and still remembered the occasion vividly. He met Lord and brought him on board the production as a consultant. The film diverges from both the book and the NBC TV adaptation in focusing on a central character, Second Officer Charles Lightoller, played by Moore. Its conclusion reflects Lord's world-historical theme of a \"world changed for ever\" with a fictional conversation between Lightoller and Colonel Archibald Gracie, sitting on a lifeboat. Lightoller declares that the disaster is \"different ... Because we were so sure. Because even though it's happened, it's still unbelievable. I don't think I'll ever feel sure again.

They also took Kitty, Astor's pet Airedale, and occupied one of the parlour suites. On the night of April 14, 1912, Colonel Astor reported to his wife that the ship had hit an iceberg. He reassured her that the damage did not appear serious, though he helped her strap on her life jacket. Whilst they were waiting on the boat-deck, Mrs. Astor lent Leah Aks, a third-class passenger, her fur shawl to keep her son, Filly, warm. At one point, the Astors retired to the gymnasium and sat on the mechanical horses in their life jackets. Colonel Astor found another life jacket which he reportedly cut with a pen knife to show Madeleine what it was made of. When it was time to board a lifeboat, Madeleine Astor, her maid, and her nurse had to crawl through the first-class promenade window into the tilting lifeboat 4 (which had been lowered down to A deck to take on more passengers). Astor had helped his wife to climb through the window and asked if he could accompany her as she was 'in a delicate condition'. The request was denied by Second Officer Charles Lightoller. An account of Madeleine's boarding of the lifeboat was given by Archibald Gracie IV to the US Senate Titanic inquiry. Gracie was a fellow passenger and recalled the events regarding Madeleine Astor  in the following terms."]}, {"page": "RMS Oceanic (1899)", "response": ["Oceanic was built to accommodate 1,710 passengers: 410 First Class, 300 Second Class and 1,000 Third Class, plus 349 crew.

All of the ship's crew transferred to the trawler via the ship's lifeboats and were then ferried to the waiting AMC HMS Alsatian, and HMS Forward.
