He continued to manage the artists and work in the music industry when Blast First was bought by Mute Records. Now he runs the very small label \"Blast First Petite\" on which he develops and sometime releases stuff that was refused by Mute's Blast First, including Rivulets and HTRK. He now has an exclusive contract with Pan Sonic.\nIn 2002 he produced a multimedia performance event at the Barbican to mark the release of Iain Sinclair's book London Orbital. The event featured a diverse range of artists from the literary and music worlds including J.G. Ballard and Bill Drummond. [1]\nPaul Smith also produced the final British tour of Ken Kesey, taking him on a bus tour around festivals in summer 1997. He is also known for King Mob, a record label of spoken word performances by famous counter-culture authors from the beat generation to Iain Sinclair and Stewart Home.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Smith", "response": ["Paul Smith or Paul Smith's may refer to:", "* Paul Smith (composer) (1906\u20131985), American film music composer", "* Paul Smith (pianist) (1922\u20132013), Los Angeles jazz pianist", "* Paul Smith (rock vocalist) (born 1979), vocalist and songwriter of British indie rock band Max\u00efmo Park", "* Paul Smith (Christian music singer) (born 1953), American contemporary Christian music performer and songwriter", "* Paul Smith (music industry executive) (fl. 1985\u2013present), British record label manager and art event producer", "* Paul Smith, drummer in the band Dengue Fever", "* Paul Smith (Irish writer) (1920\u20131997), writer and playwright", "* Paul Smith (television writer) (born 1961), British creator of television series and television writer", "* Paul Smith (blogger), 21st century British writer and creator of the Twitchhiker Project", "* Paul Smith (journalist) (fl. 2002\u2013present), British football journalist", "* Paul Smith (historian) (born 1937), British historian of Victorian England", "* Paul Smith (Australian actor) (born 1968), starred in the Australian sitcom Hey Dad...!", "* Paul Smith (animator) (1906\u20131980), American animator and director best known for his work in Woody Woodpecker cartoons", "* Paul Smith (American actor, born 1929), American comic character actor", "* Paul Smith (artist) (1921\u20132007), American typewriter artist", "* Paul Smith (fashion designer) (born 1946), British fashion designer", "* Paul Smith (comics) (born 1953), American comic book artist", "* M.

Tensions between Smith and the group had begun in 1986 when Smith arranged the release of live recordings by the band on the album Walls Have Ears without their input. Mindful about their work and image, Sonic Youth was irritated by the decision, especially when the album was distributed before Evol. The situation was compounded further when Smith took a bold negotiating stance with major record labels during the Daydream Nation tour and took long intervals to communicate information to the band. His stance, which had the potential to scare away record executives, represented the final straw for the band. On June 2, 1989, Sonic Youth went to Smith's apartment, ostensibly to discuss another music video for Daydream Nation, to announce an end to their partnership."]}, {"page": "Paul Smith (music industry)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Smith (music industry executive)"]}]}}
