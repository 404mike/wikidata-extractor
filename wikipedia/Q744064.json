In late January 1805 in a standup furore at Windsor Castle the King was furious to find out that the Prime Minister was trying to interfere.  Pitt's cronyism would eventually cause his downfall, and Manners Sutton was duly chosen to succeed John Moore as Archbishop of Canterbury. During his primacy the old archiepiscopal palace at Croydon was sold and the country palace of Addington bought with the proceeds. He presided over the first meeting which issued in the foundation of the National Society, and subsequently lent the scheme his strong support. He also exerted himself to promote the establishment of the Indian episcopate. As Archbishop of Canterbury, Manners-Sutton appointed his cousin, Evelyn Levett Sutton, a chaplain to Lord Manners, as one of six preachers of Canterbury Cathedral in 1811. "]}]}}
