One of the major items of the first AGM was a resolution passed to support a campaign that had been mounted to re-instate the Apprentice \"wheel\" badge.   The right to wear the \"wheel\" had been lost under the 1974 revision of the arrangements for the treatment of young airmen and apprentices under training.   The campaign resulted in the reinstatement of the \"wheel\" in time for the Graduation of the 134th Entry in September 1982.   Another major item was the recommendation that further Reunions should be held at three-year intervals with the first Triennial Reunion held in 1983.", "The Patron of the \"Old Haltonians\" Association is Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Armitage (56th entry, Aircraft Apprentices) and the Vice-Patrons are Air Marshal Cliff Spink (104th entry, Aircraft Apprentices) and Air Marshal Sir \"Dusty\" Graham Miller (RAF officer) (210th entry, Craft Apprentices)."]}, {"page": "Air Member for Materiel", "response": ["*7 February 1985 Air Marshal Sir Michael Armitage                      "]}, {"page": "Michael Armitage", "response": ["Michael Armitage may refer to:", "* Michael Armitage (artist) (born 1984), Kenyan painter", "* Michael Armitage (politician) (born 1949), former Australian politician", "* Michael Armitage (RAF officer) (born 1930), Royal Air Force commander"]}, {"page": "Sir Michael Armitage", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Armitage (RAF officer)"]}]}}
