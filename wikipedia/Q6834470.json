However the appointment of Sir Michael Smith in 1801 had been made in an effort to turn the office into a full-time judicial position which would attract first class lawyers. Given William's youth, and the blatant nepotism involved in his appointment, it might have been expected to cause controversy. In fact, according to Elrington Ball, there was no protest and the appointment worked out far better than had  been feared: William had a reputation for integrity, was popular  and hospitable, and a fairly good lawyer.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921  John Murray London 1926 An obituary notice published soon after his death in January 1837  bears Ball's assessment out: MacMahon was  praised for integrity and lack of political prejudice and as an exceptionally  painstaking and conscientious judge; while the writer admitted  that William   was very slow in giving judgment,  this was attributed to his desire to ensure that justice was done.Gentleman's Magazine April 1837 In 1827 he clashed publicly with the new Lord Chancellor of Ireland,  Sir Anthony Hart,  about his right to appoint his own secretary, but the misunderstanding was quickly resolved."]}, {"page": "Cusack-Smith baronets", "response": ["The Smith, later Cusack-Smith Baronetcy, of Tuam in the King's County, was a title in the Baronetage of Ireland.
