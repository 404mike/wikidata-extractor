Despite this, Torquay managed to register their biggest win of the campaign so far with a 3\u20130 defeat of the Silkmen thanks to first goals of the season from Brian Saah, Chris McPhee and Eunan O'Kane.  Howe was fit enough to be restored to the starting line-up alongside Bodin for the next match which, ironically, resulted in a lacklustre 0\u20130 draw with Northampton Town at the Sixfields Stadium.  This was then followed up by two further draws against Cheltenham Town and Rotherham United, both at Plainmoor.  Although these were far more entertaining matches than the Northampton stalemate, it was concerning that Torquay had fallen behind within the first five minutes of both games.  However, the Gulls did at least show the desire to fight back in both games, gaining a 2\u20132 result against Cheltenham and finishing the epic Rotherham encounter with a 3\u20133 scoreline.

However, it was not such good news on the pitch with the Shrews gaining revenge for last season's play-off defeat, beating the Gulls 2\u20130 in a match which also saw Rene Howe dismissed for a second bookable offence.  It was a disappointing end to a month which left the Gulls in 13th position in the League Two table having started it in 12th. It was now becoming clear that if Torquay were to avoid a season of mid-table mediocrity (or worse), they would need to start converting some of their draws into wins.", "While the Chesterfield match saw the earlier than expected return from injury of Ian Morris, the Gulls' next League encounter resulted in another long-term injury with defender Brian Saah picking up a serious tear to his groin. Although there was a ready-made replacement in Chris Robertson (who had recently lost his place in the team to Mark Ellis), the possible length of Saah's absence prompted Martin Ling to bring in young Colchester United defender Tom Aldred as cover until January. However, Saah's injury was probably the only negative point to a game which saw Torquay achieve their first League win over Devon rivals Plymouth Argyle since 1972.  A stunning second half brace from Eunan O'Kane helped the Gulls record a 3\u20131 victory over a Pilgrims side who were languishing at the bottom of League Two having only just been relegated from League One the previous season.", "For the second time during the season, Torquay achieved a clean sweep in the monthly awards with Martin Ling recognised as the League Two Manager of the Month again, this time being joined by captain Lee Mansell as the League's Player of the Month.
