Planning for this facility started in 1845 and he designed the first section\u2014a ward with 20 beds\u2014in 1848. It opened on 9 November 1849 and was first extended in 1852 when Hellyer built a laundry and an outpatients building.  He enlarged the original ward in 1864, and in 1874 designed a children's ward after a benefactor offered money for this purpose. Six years later a resident offered \u00a35,500 for the construction of a convalescent home within the hospital grounds as a memorial to her parents, and Hellyer designed the Milligan Block, also known as the Milligan Convalescent Home. The hospital closed in 1992 and all the buildings were demolished soon afterward. His last work for which a date is known, was a school at the top of St. John's Road in Ryde, built in 1883 and now used as a community centre. Like his school at nearby Green Street, it has mullioned windows and tall gabled bays. Another of his later works in Ryde, although the date is not known, was Appley Towers. This was a \"fine mock Elizabethan mansion\" occupied by the Hutt family and later by Sir Hedworth Williamson, 8th Baronet's son, the 9th Baronet Williamson. A lodge, folly (also designed by Hellyer  1875), and other associated buildings remain, but the house has been demolished."]}, {"page": "Hedworth", "response": ["* Sir Hedworth Williamson, 8th Baronet (1827\u20131900), British politician"]}]}}
