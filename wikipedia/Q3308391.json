He was seriously wounded at Dublin, and was a prisoner of war for two extended periods.At the end of the English Interregnum, Mohun was one of the men \u2014 George Jolly and John Rhodes were others \u2014 who attempted to restart dramatic performance. In 1659 Mohun performed with other pre-Commonwealth actors in an unlicensed troupe at the Red Bull Theatre. As the manager of the troupe, Mohun came to an agreement with the Master of the Revels to pay fees for the privilege of performing; but eventually, like Jolly and Rhodes, he was out-manoeuvred by Thomas Killigrew and Sir William Davenant. After a complex power struggle for the two company patents issued by Charles II at the Restoration of the monarchy, Mohun became a full sharer in Killigrew's King's Company. Along with Charles Hart, the other leading male actor, Mohun was in a position of some authority, often signing official papers on behalf of the sharing actors. He remained a member of the King's Company until he left the stage on account of age and ill-health in the late 1670s.\nMohun regularly acted leading and major roles, mostly villains. His interpretations of Iago and of the title role in Ben Jonson's Volpone were famous, and he brought a sinister edge to the part of Pinchwife in William Wycherley's The Country Wife. Mohun repeatedly seconded Charles Hart's leads, playing Iago to Hart's Othello, and Cassius to Hart's Brutus.\nMohun compiled a long list of noteworthy other roles in his career. He played Bellamente in Shirley's Love's Cruelty both before 1642 and after 1660, and he acted in other revivals besides those named above. He played:\n\nFace in The Alchemist\nTruewit in Epicene\nLeontius in The Humorous Lieutenant\nDon Leon in Rule a Wife and Have a Wife\nMelantius in The Maid's Tragedy\nMardonius in A King and No King\nAubrey in Rollo Duke of Normandy.He took roles in contemporary Restoration dramas, by John Dryden \u2014\n\nMaximin in Tyrannick Love\nVentidius in All for Love\nRhodophil in Marriage \u00e0 la mode\nthe Old Emperor in Aureng-zebe\nBeaumont in Amboyna\nPhilocles in The Maiden Queen\nBelamy in An Evening's Love\nthe Emperor in The Indian Emperour\nthe Duke of Mantua in The Assignation\u2014 and by other playwrights:\n\nPinchwife in Wycherly's The Country Wife\nClytus in Nathaniel Lee's The Rival Queens\nAugustus Caesar in Lee's Gloriana\nBritannicus in Lee's The Tragedy of Nero\nHannibal in Lee's Sophonisba, or Hannibal's Overthrow\nMythridates in Lee's Mythridates, King of Pontus\nLord Burleigh in John Banks's The Unhappy Favourite\nMatthias in John Crowne's The Destruction of Jerusalem\nBreakbond in Edward Howard's The Man of Newmarket\nKing Edward III in The Black Prince by Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery.Mohun retired from the stage in 1682, when the King's Company joined with the Duke's Company to form the United Company.

Her voice was weak, tho' very mellow; she generally acted the young innocent lady whom all the heroes are mad in love with\".Thomas Betterton's description of Boutell, quoted by Ogden, xxx. Boutell's previous recorded roles had in fact all been unmarried as well as innocent girls, and Margery was her first married role.Howe, 181; note however that the records for this time are extremely incomplete.

Killigrew beat Davenant to a debut, at Gibbon's Tennis Court in Clare Market, with the new King's Company. Its original members were Michael Mohun, William Wintershall, Robert Shatterell, William Cartwright, Walter Clun, Charles Hart and Nicholas Burt. They played for a time at the old Red Bull Theatre, but in 1663 the company moved to the new Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. (Unfortunately, Killigrew gained a reputation as an incompetent manager; he was constantly in disputes with his actors and had to bribe his stars to keep working for him.) Killigrew staged plays by Aphra Behn, John Dryden, William Wycherley...and Thomas Killigrew, as well as revivals of Beaumont and Fletcher. Having inherited the rights and repertory of the old King's Men, the King's Company  performed many of Shakespeare's works, in the rewritten forms that were so popular at the time and so disparaged later.

Internal power structures were the main reason for this difference: while Davenant skilfully commanded a docile young troupe, Killigrew's authority over his veteran actors was far from absolute.\"Apparently the King's Company had no strong, centralized management\u00a0... Of course Killigrew would have had trouble getting Mohun's troupe to accept the kind of absolute control Davenant was able to impose upon his fledglings. But squabbles over management and shares were to characterize the King's Company throughout its stormy career, and ultimately they led to its downfall\". Experienced actors Michael Mohun (who Pepys called \"the best actor in the world\") and Charles Hart held out for shares and good contracts in the King's Company. Such a division of power between the patentee, Killigrew, and his chief actors led to frequent conflicts that hampered the Theatre Royal as a business venture. Nevertheless, it was mostly at the struggling Theatre Royal, rather than at the efficiently run Lincoln's Inn Fields, that the plays were acted that are classics today. This applies especially to the new form Restoration comedy, dominated in the 1660s by William Wycherley and the Theatre Royal's house dramatist John Dryden. Actors such as Hart and Charles II's mistress Nell Gwyn developed and refined the famous scenes of repartee, banter and flirtation in Dryden's and Wycherley's comedies. With the appearance of actresses for the first time at Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields in the 1660s, British playwrights wrote parts for outspoken female characters, daring love scenes and provocative breeches roles.Byrd, Ann Marie. \"Violently Erotic: Representing Rape in Restoration Drama\"  in Greenfield (2015), p. 69 In any case, the competition between the King's Company and the Duke's was good for the rebirth and development of English drama."]}, {"page": "Charles Hart (actor)", "response": ["Just before the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, acting resumed on a larger scale, and Hart seems to have been then a member of a company performing at the Cockpit playhouse, led by Michael Mohun. As soon as the King's Company was formed in 1660, Hart became one of its leading men; he specialised in playing the male half of witty, bantering couples. This type of dialogue in Restoration comedy was largely influenced by the talents and personalities of Hart and Nell Gwyn, in plays like James Howard's The Mad Couple; Gwyn was his mistress before she became Charles II's. Hart's natural dignity in playing royal roles was also often commented on by contemporaries, and in the heroic play he \"was celebrated for superman roles, notably the arrogant, bloodthirsty Almanzor in John Dryden's Conquest of Granada.\"Peter Dixon, ed., William Wycherley: The Country Wife and Other Plays, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1996."]}, {"page": "Tyrannick Love", "response": ["In addition to Gwyn, the original 1669 production by the King's Company featured Margaret Hughes as St. Catherine, Michael Mohun as Maximus, Charles Hart as Porphyrius, Rebecca Marshall as Berenice, William Cartwright as Apollonius, Edward Lydall as Valerius, William Beeston as Nigrinus, Richard Bell as Amariel, Elizabeth James as Damilcar and Edward Kynaston as Placidius.

Performances in grand private houses were not unusual, and could have quite elaborate sets, as can be seen from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant's opera The Siege of Rhodes (1656) at his home Rutland House. This was public theatre in all but name, as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission. Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London, such as that of Michael Mohun at the Red Bull Theatre. Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle-aged, biding their time, and hoping for the monarchy to be restored. By the later 1650s, it was becoming obvious that that time was at hand, and William Davenant, for example, stepped up his theatrical activities.\"Sir William Davenant\", from Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 58: \"Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists.\"", "When the public performance ban was lifted at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II immediately encouraged the drama and took a personal interest in the scramble for acting licences and performance rights which followed. Two middle-aged pre-Commonwealth playwrights notable for their loyalty during Charles' exile emerged from the struggle with royal Letters Patent for new, or refurbished, patent theatre companies: Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant. Killigrew was able to take over Michael Mohun's skilled veteran troupe for his \"King's Company\" and to start with \"what was essentially a going concern\" (Hume), with the added advantage of the traditional performance rights Mohun brought with him for practically the whole classic repertory of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the Beaumont and Fletcher team. The competition, Davenant's \"Duke's Company\", seemed doomed to a secondary position with its young, scratched-together troupe and scarcely any performance rights. They were only allowed to put on abridged and modernized versions of Shakespeare plays, and a few that Davenant had written. However, Davenant, \"a brilliant impresario\" (Hume), was soon able to turn the tables on Killigrew by realising his old pre-Civil War dream of music, dance, and spectacular visual effects on the public stage.Hume, 233\u2013238.", "During the autumn of 1660, while the Duke's Company was still getting financed (mostly by means of the actors buying company shares) and having temporary quarters set up, the King's Company offered a string of well-received productions. Their new albeit traditional theatre in Vere Street was already fully operational. The devoted playgoer Samuel Pepys called it \"the finest playhouse... that ever was in England\" in his diary, a sentiment he would need to revise many times over the coming decade, and recorded his awe at seeing Michael Mohun, \"who is said to be the best actor in the world\", act on its stage. Davenant was far behind, but daringly put all his capital into the outfitting of a new superior playhouse in Lincoln's Inn Fields (simultaneously, with great foresight, prying loose the rising young star Thomas Betterton from the King's Company), and perfectly hit public taste.", "The Duke's Company, operating smoothly under what soon became Davenant's and Thomas Betterton's joint management, consistently led the way while the King's lagged further and further behind, moving only in forced response and suffering from chronic management conflict between Killigrew and powerful actor shareholders like Michael Mohun and Charles Hart, who insisted on actor-centred \"talk\" drama. The difference can be traced in Pepys' regular preference for performances at the Duke's, and in his ever-renewed admiration for Betterton's acting. In December 1667, the King's Company even ceased acting for some days because of a quarrel between Mohun and Hart. With the escalation of expense, days with zero takings were a very serious matter.
