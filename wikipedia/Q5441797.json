Baynham told the Guardian that \"despite the fact that people say he's awful, a lot of the time we were trying to build empathy: you're watching a man suffer but also at some level identifying with his pain\". Marber said Partridge's fundamental characteristic is desperation. Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge's assistant Lynn, felt he was vulnerable and loveable, and a good person \"deep down\". Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him, and that despite his failings he was \"the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime \u2013 he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum\".

Her presence is mainly indicated by her telephone calls to her husband. The nearest we get to seeing her is in one episode where we hear her footsteps, and another where we see her very large posterior hanging down above Mainwaring when they are in bunks in an air raid shelter, giving a clue to her figure. Wilson is the only one who has ever met her, but when asked to describe her, he cannot, although he admits she looks \"a bit odd\". Through dialogue it is clear that Mrs Mainwaring is cold, reclusive, and withholding of affection, and that she is clearly the dominant figure in the marriage. It is often implied she may be an alcoholic, as Mainwaring is repeatedly revealed to be buying bootleg whisky and gin from Walker for his wife, but insists she takes it only for \"medicinal purposes\". Mainwaring often uses the platoon as a means of avoiding her and prefers not to introduce her to other people, lest she upset them. Sometimes Captain Mainwaring appears sporting minor physical injuries, such as a black eye in the episode \"War Dance\" for which he offers comically unconvincing explanations such as \"walking into the linen cupboard door\". It is strongly insinuated that the injuries are the result of domestic violence and they often seem to happen before a function or event where other women may be present, to which Elizabeth is invited but cannot attend as it would involve going out. Perhaps she is an agoraphobic, but she does venture out of the house (off-camera) in \"The Godiva Affair\" and is away, visiting her sister, in various episodes. We discover in \"Never Too Old\" that Mrs Mainwaring was the daughter of the Suffragan Bishop of Clegthorpe (a fictional see) and her parents look down on Captain Mainwaring as \"marrying beneath her\". In \"A Soldier's Farewell\" Mainwaring claims she is vegetarian.
