Between 1853 and 1856 he visited Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand and various parts of the South Pacific (Huisman, 2000 & Papenfuss, 1976). His collection in Australia resulted in one of the most extensive collections of marine plants and it inspired others (Huisman, 2000). He published: Nereis Australis Or Algae of the Southern Ocean in 1847\u20131849 and in 1846\u201351 his Phycologia Britannica appeared. His Nereis Boreali-Americana was published in three parts (1852\u20131858) this was the first, and still is (1976) is the only marine algal flora of North America as it includes taxa from the Pacific coast (Papenfuss, 1976 p.\u00a027).

His Phycologia Britannica lists species recorded and collected from various parts of the British Isles. For example, he notes William Thompson (1805\u20131852), William McCalla (c.1814\u20131849), John Templeton (1766\u20131825) and D.

Checklists and annotated checklists were produced and updated so the actual numbers of different species became more precise. At first this was quite local.
