He retired in 2015 and is now Emeritus Professor.   He is recognised as one of the leading experts in the history of medieval England.Nigel Saul has written numerous books including Knights and Esquires, The Gloucestershire Gentry in the Fourteenth Century (Oxford, 1981), and The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval England (Oxford, 1997). His major biography Richard II (Yale, 1997) was the product of ten years' work and was acclaimed by P. D. James as \"unlikely to be surpassed in scholarship, comprehensiveness, or in the biographer's insight into his subject's character\".  In 2011 he published a comprehensive survey of English chivalry, For Honour and Fame. Chivalry in England, 1066-1500 (Bodley Head, 2011).  More recently he has written on the history of church monuments.  His English Church Monuments in the Middle Ages: History and Representation (Oxford 2009) earned wide praise as a successful attempt to tackle the subject from a historical perspective.  He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and served as President of the Monumental Brass Society between 1995 and 2002.\nProf. Saul has served as Honorary President of the college's Conservative Future Society.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard II of England", "response": ["Richard's mental state has been a major issue of historical debate since the first academic historians started treating the subject in the 19th century. One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was Bishop Stubbs. Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign, Richard's mind \"was losing its balance altogether\". Historian Anthony Steel, who wrote a full-scale biography of the king in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that Richard had schizophrenia.Steel (1941), p. 8. This was challenged by V. H. Galbraith, who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis, a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, such as Anthony Goodman and Anthony Tuck. Nigel Saul, who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II, concedes thateven though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illnesshe showed clear signs of a narcissistic personality, and towards the end of his reign \"Richard's grasp on reality was becoming weaker\".Saul (1997), pp. 460\u20134."]}, {"page": "Category talk:English historians", "response": ["List of all pages in category English historians retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.
