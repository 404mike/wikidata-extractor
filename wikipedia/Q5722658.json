There are a number of Henry's works stored in the permanent collections of various provincial museums and art galleries including Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum and the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) Gallery. As well as at the Birmingham Society of Arts (the precursor to the RBSA), Henry also exhibited at the Royal Academy, British Institution and Society of British Artists. The Wright family's patronage of the Lines family is also evident in William Rostill Lines's (Henry's younger brother) sculpture Bust of Mr. Thomas Wright Hill that was exhibited at the Birmingham Society of Arts Exhibition in 1829.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Line", "response": ["*** Henry Harris Lines (1800 or 1801\u20131889)"]}, {"page": "Malvern Hills", "response": ["Paintings of the Malvern Hills include Henry Harris Lines's The British Camp and Herefordshire Beacon (1872), now in the Worcester City Museums."]}, {"page": "Samuel Lines", "response": ["Lines' pupils included Thomas Creswick, Andrew Hunt, William Wyon, Bernard Walter Evans and his own sons Samuel Rostill Lines, Frederick Thomas Lines and Henry Harris Lines.
