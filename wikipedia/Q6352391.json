", "Arul Pragasam was the father of jewellery designer Kali Arulpragasam, musician/filmmaker/visual artist Mathangi \"Maya\" Arulpragasam (better known by her stage name, M.I.A.), and Sugu Arulpragasam. His family moved back to Sri Lanka when Maya was six months old. M.I.A. named her 2005 debut album Arular after her father, partly for him to get in contact with her. \"Arular\" was his nom de guerre during the civil war. M.I.A. said of her upbringing: \"I only had my mum. I never grew up with my dad so I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s like. I think I\u2019m a mixture of both. My mum\u2019s really passive, quiet and she\u2019s not feisty. She cared about bringing in food and getting us to school and stuff but that\u2019s as far as it went. Growing up without a dad, I was going to school and turning up at parents' meetings on my own. At the time everyone was like, \"Oh if you had a dad he\u2019d pay for your school and you\u2019d have a better future\". At the time, my mom was bringing us up and she was like, \"The only thing your father gave you was a name\". So that's why I used [his name \"Arular\"] on my album to turn it into a statement that my mom always made. If the only thing he's going to give me is a name, then that's what I'm going to use.\" In 2005, M.I.A. told EGO Magazine that despite her father's involvement in the conflict, she felt no affiliation to either armed party in the war, noting her work to be the voice of \"civilians and refugees that get caught up in the cross fire of politics\" and shocking enough to invoke discussion in young people that felt they had no right to talk. Following the end of the armed conflict in 2009, M.I.A. condemned the Government of Sri Lanka for engaging in systematic genocide against Tamils. In a 2010 feature for The Fader, she stated of the US and Sri Lankan government's behaviour towards her following her rise in prominence: \"He negotiated peace processes, brought in the new army, and when he goes to Sri Lanka, it\u2019s the government who gives him security against the Tigers\", she explains. \"They used it the other way and told the world my dad\u2019s a Tiger which got me to this point. It\u2019s like, 'Wow I didn\u2019t know this guy, and this guy has been working for you for 20 fucking years, and when you feel like it you want to use my own dad against me to discredit what I do.'\""]}, {"page": "List of British Sri Lankans", "response": ["* Kali Arulpragasam"]}, {"page": "List of Tamil businesspeople", "response": ["* Kali Arulpragasam"]}, {"page": "List of jewellery designers", "response": ["* Kali Arulpragasam"]}]}}
