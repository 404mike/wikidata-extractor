He was interested in politics from the time he was an apprentice electrician, and was active in the co-operative movement in Rutherglen.Cook was active in the Independent Labour Party until the early 1930s, when he joined the Scottish Socialist Party split. This affiliated to the Labour Party, under which label Cook served as Member of Parliament for constituencies in Dundee from 1945 until his death in 1952. He was first elected for the two member constituency of Dundee at the 1945 general election, being elected at the head of the poll. When that seat was abolished for the 1950 election he was elected as the first member for the new seat of Dundee East. In parliament he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the President of the Board of Trade, working under Stafford Cripps and Harold Wilson, and then from 1950 to 1951 was an Under-Secretary of State at the Colonial Office.The Glasgow Herald described him \"as one of the most popular Labour men in the House\".Cook died as a result of a road traffic accident a few minutes before midnight on 31 May 1952. He was driving on the Arbroath to Dundee road when the car he was driving left the road and collided with a tree and went over a low wall in to a field resulting in his instant death due to crush injuries to his chest. The owner of the car, a local businessman named John Ross, was also in the vehicle and was taken to Dundee Royal Infirmary to be treated for arm injuries. Cook's wife had died the previous December and he was survived by a son and a daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Thomas Cook"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Thomas Cook"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Thomas Cook"]}, {"page": "Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| 1950 || Thomas Cook || Labour"]}, {"page": "Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Thomas Cook"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Thomas Cook"]}, {"page": "Thomas Cooke", "response": ["Thomas Cooke or Thomas Cook may refer to:", "*Thomas Cooke (author) (1703\u20131756), English translator of the classics", "*Thomas Cooke (actor) (1786\u20131864), English actor", "*Thomas Cook (MP for Marlborough), Member of Parliament (MP) for Marlborough, 1399", "*Thomas Cook (MP for Exeter), MP for Exeter, 1417\u20131442", "*Thomas Cooke (mayor) (died 1478), Lord Mayor of London", "*Thomas Cook (MP for North Norfolk) (1902\u20131970), Member of the United Kingdom Parliament for North Norfolk, 1931\u20131945", "*Thomas Cook (Scottish politician) (1908\u20131952), Member of the United Kingdom Parliament for Dundee", "*Thomas Cooke (British Army officer) (1841\u20131912), British general", "*Thomas Cooke (soldier, born 1881) (1881\u20131916), Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*Thomas Cooke (bishop) (1792\u20131870), Canadian Roman Catholic bishop", "*Thomas Cook (bishop) (1866\u20131928), Anglican Bishop of Lewes", "*Thomas Cooke (English footballer) (fl. 1880s), English footballer for Notts County", "*Thomas Cooke (soccer) (1885\u20131964), American football player, and member of the 1904 US Olympic Team", "*Thomas Cooke (footballer, born 1913) (1913\u20131974), English footballer for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic and Mansfield Town", "*Thomas Cooke (banker) (died 1752), English merchant and banker", "*Thomas Cooke (scientific instrument maker) (1807\u20131868), telescope maker, founder of T.

On 31 May 1952 he was travelling between Arbroath and Dundee when his car left the road, struck a tree and went over a low wall in to a field, killing him instantly. Reporting Cook's death, The Glasgow Herald speculated that Labour should fairly safely hold the seat in the by-election to follow, arguing that while until October 1951 the seat might have been considered marginal, Cook's holding of it against a strong campaign suggested that the seat could now be considered a safe one for Labour. However the newspaper opined that the strength of Labour's majority would give some indication as to the extent of the \"alleged unpopularity\" of the Conservative Government."]}, {"page": "Scottish Socialist Party (1932)", "response": ["The party's first chair was Dollan, with councillors Andrew Gilzean as vice-chair and Arthur Brady as secretary.
