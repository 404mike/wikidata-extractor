His works include Chronicon Angli\u00e6, controversially attacking John of Gaunt, and Ypodigma Neustri\u00e6 (Chronicle of Normandy), justifying Henry V's invasion, and dedicated to him in 1419.\nHe is no relation to Sir Francis Walsingham, spymaster to Queen Elizabeth I.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lollardy", "response": ["A group of gentry active during the reign of Richard II (1377\u201399) were known as \"Lollard Knights\" either during or after their lives due to their acceptance of Wycliffe's claims. Henry Knighton, in his Chronicle, identifies the principal Lollard Knights as Thomas Latimer, John Trussell, Lewis Clifford, Sir John Peche (son of John Peche of Wormleighton), Richard Storey, and Reginald Hilton. Thomas Walsingham's Chronicle adds William Nevil and John Clanvowe to the list, and other potential members of this circle have been identified by their wills, which contain Lollard-inspired language about how their bodies are to be plainly buried and permitted to return to the soil whence they came. There is little indication that the Lollard Knights were specifically known as such during their lifetimes; they were men of discretion, and unlike Sir John Oldcastle years later, rarely gave any hint of open rebellion. However, they displayed a remarkable ability to retain important positions without falling victim to the various prosecutions of Wycliffe's followers occurring during their lifetimes.", "Religious and secular authorities strongly opposed Lollardy. A primary opponent was Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by bishops like Henry le Despenser of Norwich, whom the chronicler Thomas Walsingham praised for his zeal..

Shakespeare's Falstaff was originally named \"Oldcastle,\" following his main source, The Famous Victories of Henry V.

That friendship, and the prince's political opposition to Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, perhaps encouraged Lollard hopes.

This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386.McKisack (1959), pp. 425, 442\u20133. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.Saul (1997), p. 437.", "The popular view of Richard has more than anything been influenced by Shakespeare's play about the king, Richard II. Shakespeare's Richard was a cruel, vindictive and irresponsible king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power.Saul (1997), p. 1. Writing a work of fiction, however, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions, basing his play on works by writers such as Edward Hall and Samuel Daniel, who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham.Saul (1997), pp. 3\u20134. Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard.Saul (2005), pp. 11\u20132. The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard's misrule that did not end until Henry VII's accession in 1485. The idea that Richard was to blame for the later-15th century Wars of the Roses was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th. Some recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses in isolation from the reign of Richard II."]}, {"page": "Isabella of France", "response": ["Isabella was born in Paris on an uncertain date\u2014on the basis of the chroniclers and the eventual date of her marriage, she was probably born between April 1295 and January 1296. She is described as born in 1292 in the Annals of Wigmore, and Piers Langtoft agrees, claiming that she was 7 years old in 1299. The French chronicler Guillaume de Nangis and English chronicler Thomas Walsingham describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and of 1296. A papal dispensation by Clement V in November 1305 permitted her immediate marriage by proxy, despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since her brother Charles was born on 18 June 1294, and she had to reach the canonical age of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between April 1295 and January 1296.See Weir 2006, pp. 8\u20139.

Weighing the available evidence, Reese concludes that \"it seems doubtful if even a third of the foot soldiers returned to England.\" If his estimate is accurate, of 16,000 English infantrymen, about 11,000 were killed. The English chronicler Thomas Walsingham gave the number of English men-at-arms who were killed as 700,Mackenzie, p.88 referencing Walsingham, p.141 while 500 more men-at-arms were spared for ransom.

Among the key accounts was the anonymous Anonimalle Chronicle, whose author appears to have been part of the royal court and an eye-witness to many of the events in London. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham was present for much of the revolt, but focused his account on the terror of the social unrest and was extremely biased against the rebels.;  The events were recorded in France by Jean Froissart, the author of the Chronicles.
