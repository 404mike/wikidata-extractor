A boxer in his younger days, he was elected as a councillor to the then Glasgow Town Council in 1964 for Kelvinside, and moved over to the larger Strathclyde Regional Council in 1975 for Gorbals. He successfully blocked implementation of fluoridation in court by arguing it violated the 1946 Water Act and the 1968 Medicine Act.By the time he became an MP, Wray was a wealthy man. He was on the left-wing of the Labour Party, and joined the Campaign Group. His political stances were Eurosceptic, an advocate of Irish republicanism regarding Northern Ireland, and opposed to abortion and the abolition of Section 28. His views on Northern Ireland led him to be tagged \"I.R. Wray\" by Private Eye. In 2002, he attacked the Scottish Parliament, labeling its members \"odds and sods\".Wray stood down as an MP, aged 70, at the 2005 general election following a stroke in December 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 28", "response": ["*  1935   \u2013 Jimmy Wray, Scottish boxer and politician (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Jimmy Wray", "| Jimmy Wray"]}, {"page": "Socialist Campaign Group", "response": ["* Jimmy Wray (2005)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jimmy Wray"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jimmy Wray"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Provan (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Jimmy Wray"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Baillieston (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["In 1997, the addition of much of the Shettleston constituency increased the notional majority of the previous Provan MP, Jimmy Wray, to 14,165 (40.7%) over the SNP.", "| Jimmy Wray"]}, {"page": "1994 Labour Party leadership election", "response": ["| Jimmy Wray || Prescott || Prescott"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Jimmy Wray, Glasgow Provan, 1987\u201397; Glasgow Baillieston, 1997\u20132005"]}, {"page": "Hugh Brown (politician)", "response": ["He survived a reselection challenge by a Militant candidate before the 1983 general election, and retired before the 1987 general election.
