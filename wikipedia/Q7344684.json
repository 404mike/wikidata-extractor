Garside began his record-setting run following two aborted attempts from Cape Town, South Africa and London, England. Garside set off from New Delhi, India on 20 October 1997, completing his run back at the same point on 13 June 2003.\nWhile his run has been challenged by some ultra distance runners and some members of the press, subsequent publications clarified a number of the points raised, such as anomalies in his online diary, and his running of the Nullarbor plain without a support crew \u2013 a feat believed impossible according to classic ultrarunning methodologies but achieved using lateral thinking and relying upon passing traffic and local people to drop off water for him instead \u2013 and highlighted the clashes of personality, running approach, and actions, that had engendered the concerns.\nIn assessing his feat, Trailrunner senior editor Monique Cole stated he had clearly run more of the world than anyone else, while former media critic Dan Koeppel, who became one of the few journalists outside Guinness to discuss and examine his full records at length, became convinced by 2005 that Garside had indeed run around the world and expressed great remorse and \"haunting\" guilt at his past part in fuelling a media frenzy that, as he felt, \"screwed one of the greatest runners ever\" and \"erased... one of the most incredible things a runner had ever done\".Guinness World Records, who spent several years evaluating evidence, declared it authentic and the record was officially bestowed on Garside on 27 March 2007 at a ceremony in Piccadilly Circus, London, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Circumnavigation", "response": ["* On 13 June 2003, Robert Garside completed the first recognized run around the world, taking  years; the run was authenticated in 2007 by Guinness World Records after five years of verification."]}, {"page": "Nullarbor Plain", "response": ["In 1998, runner Robert Garside ran across the Nullarbor without a formal support crew, as part of an authenticated run around the world. Unconventionally, Garside obtained water and other support from \"passing traffic\" who would leave water cached ahead for him at agreed drop-offs, to achieve the feat.It took over ten years to get this story published: Redemption of the Runningman - Dan Koeppel's blog, Bananas, Los Angeles, and Transit Geekery, 2012-07-13 (archive.org copy); full PDF of the writing is also linked from the blog post; it is also republished in The Best American Sports Writing 2013, Ed. Stout & Moehringer,  | 978-0547884608. In 2010, columnist Dan Koeppel ran the  heart of the Nullarbor with a friend the same way, to vindicate Garside. Garside commented in his diary, that \"the key to running the Nullarbor turned out to be Australian hospitality\", and Koeppel concurred that \"[F]rom an armchair it is completely impossible to run the Nullarbor. Once you're out there, however, there is a way. Robert Garside discovered it. So would I\"."]}, {"page": "Jesper Olsen (runner)", "response": ["The concept of Olsen's world run originated as a suggestion made in 2001 by Olsen to David Blaikie, who published it with an invitation for comments on his website ultramarathonworld.com.How about a documented group run around the world?, letter by Olsen to David Blaikie/UltramarathonWorld\", 2001-06-24: \"Rather than trying to supply the debate [about Garside's run] with yet another view or perception of what is to be believed and what not, I would like to offer a maybe more constructive approach... It is my point of view that should we of the ultra society act in a truly sportsman's spirit ... we should take up the challenge and do it the proper way and perform a truly documented run around the world! I am ready to do so, but not alone. As I see it, it adds to the reliability of such an event if it is conducted by a number of athletes and not by a solo runner and his crew...\" Olsen suggested that, without taking sides in then-current controversies in the ultra-running world, a professionally organized world run would be a \"constructive\" and \"truly sportsman[like]\" response to widespread ultrarunner community skepticism and discussion concerning Robert Garside's world run, which had been in progress since 1997 but was viewed with great skepticism by Blaikie and many ultra-runners and had not yet been authenticated by Guinness at the time.Group Letter, Jesper Olsen, December 2002: \"We have had our first successful international media contacts... to explain about the basic principles of the World Run as well as about the difference between our concept of documentation vs. that of Robert Garside.... we have from the beginning had good contacts with Mr. Blaikie of the \"www.ultramarathonworld.com\" - from which site the whole idea of taking on the challenge of Mr. Garside originally came\". In his letter, Olsen stated that while he was \"fairly new to the 'real' ultra-running\" world, he did hold the Danish national record  for the 100\u00a0km run (6:58:31) and for the 24-hour run (223\u00a0km), had been running marathons since around 1986 (15 years), and having finished a degree, was able to commit the time required if the proposal gained the necessary support from others.", "Olsen's run around the world took 22 months.
