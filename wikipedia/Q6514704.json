He made his debut for Wednesday against Huddersfield Town on 21 August and in his next match, a League Cup tie against Walsall, he provided Lee Peacock with an assist and earned the praise from his manager. He scored his first goal for Wednesday in a 1\u20131 draw against Walsall in the league. His promising start to his Wednesday career took a knock as he was sent off in a League Cup tie against Coventry City for \"violent conduct\". However, caretaker manager Mark Smith criticised the referee's decision. Under new manager Paul Sturrock the team managed to finish in 5th position in 2004\u201305 claiming a play-off place where they defeated Brentford to reach the final. Whelan was voted \"man of the match\" in the League One play-off final against Hartlepool United at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff after scoring the match-winning third goal for Wednesday."]}, {"page": "Ashley Chambers", "response": ["On 21 August, Chambers joined League One club Wycombe Wanderers on loan until 2 January 2010.

He made his debut in the away defeat against Rotherham United a few days later. After making his debut, Chambers fell out of contention at Blundell Park with manager Neil Woods bolstering his squad with the signings of fellow forwards Lee Peacock and Tommy Wright. He failed to make another appearance until 20 March when he came off the bench late on to and score a 91st-minute winner in a 3\u20132 win against AFC Bournemouth.

Since then, Edge has had to wait in the reserve team, with the odd appearance for the first team. On 18 January 2005, Edge, who was still a member of the club's youth team, made his debut in the FA Cup against Leicester City when Brad Jones, on loan from Middlesbrough, was cup-tied and both Kevin Stuhr Ellegaard and Lee Jones were unfit.
