However, according to local historian E. T. Davies, a new manor of Newton-juxta-Mathern was formed out of the ecclesiastical lands, and was granted by the lord of Striguil (or Chepstow) to Sir Bogo (or Bevis) de Knovell (or Knovil), Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire in 1254.  A fortified manor house or castle \u2013 sometimes called Mathern Castle \u2013 was built on the site.  Earthworks to the southwest of the existing buildings suggest that it was roughly square in form, with a surrounding ditch and an outer bailey.  The only built remnant from the period is part of a gatehouse to the north, dating from the 14th century.  This is square in plan, with two external stair turrets and some mediaeval windows."]}, {"page": "E T Davies", "response": ["#REDIRECT E. T. Davies"]}]}}
