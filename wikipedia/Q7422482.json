She was an early supporter of the Young British Artists in general, and Tracey Emin in particular, helping her to get exposure. This has led to polarised reactions of praise and opposition for Kent. She adopts a feminist stance and has stated her position to be that of \"a spokesperson, especially for women artists, in a country that is essentially hostile to contemporary art.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Young British Artists", "response": ["Richard Cork (at one time art critic of The Times) has been a staunch advocate of the artists, as has art writer Louisa Buck, and former Time Out art editor, Sarah Kent.

Steve Bachmann, in his book Simulating Sex: Aesthetic Representations of Erotic Activity pointed out that \"perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Madonna's sexual phenomenon is the extent to which her book marked a new threshold in the pornographic franchise\". McNair wrote in his book that, \"Sex brought out the personal underground to the surface of pop culture\". London art critic Sarah Kent wrote in Time Out that the timing of Sex was \"impeccable. Obsession about the human body was in vogue.
