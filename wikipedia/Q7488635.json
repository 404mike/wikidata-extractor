The contemporary art of Wales is noted perhaps more for its variety, rather than having a single set agenda. However, perhaps due to market forces or the inspirational shapes and changing light, the Welsh landscape is still particularly well represented in commercial galleries throughout Wales and beyond, either through the expressive, almost abstract, techniques used by artists like David Tress or the more traditional approaches used by others like Rob Piercy."]}, {"page": "List of 20th-century women artists", "response": ["*Shani Rhys James (born 1953), painter"]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"J\"", "response": ["*Shani Rhys James (born 1953), Welsh/English painter"]}, {"page": "Llangadfan", "response": ["Successful painter Shani Rhys James MBE is based in the village.BBC Wales Arts Shani Rhys James, last updated 28 September 2010.
