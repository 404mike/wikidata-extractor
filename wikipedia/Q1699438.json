Notable among these is the development of the \"Taylor state\", describing a minimum-energy configuration that conserves magnetic helicity. Another development was his work on the ballooning transformation, which describes the motion of plasma in toroidal (donut) configurations, which are used in the fusion field. Taylor has also made contributions to the theory of the Earth's Dynamo, including the Taylor constraint.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Taylor", "response": ["*John Bryan Taylor (born 1928), British physicist known for the Taylor state and work in plasma physics"]}, {"page": "List of plasma physicists", "response": ["|John Bryan Taylor|| helicity conservation, bootstrap current, ballooning transformation, plasma theory James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics (1999) "]}, {"page": "Spheromak", "response": ["In 1957 the ZETA (fusion reactor) machine started operation in the UK. ZETA was at that time by far the largest and most powerful fusion device in the world. It operated until 1968, by which time many devices matched its size. During its operation, the experimental team noticed that on occasion the plasma would maintain confinement long after the experimental run had ostensibly ended, although this was not then studied in depth. Years later in 1974, John Bryan Taylor characterized these self-stable plasmas, which he called \"quiescent\". He developed the Taylor state equilibrium concept, a plasma state that conserves helicity in its lowest possible energy state. This led to a re-awakening of compact toroid research."]}, {"page": "ZETA (fusion reactor)", "response": ["John Bryan Taylor took up the issue and began a detailed theoretical study of the concept, publishing a groundbreaking 1974 article on the topic. He demonstrated that as the magnetic field that generated the pinch was relaxing, it interacted with the pre-existing stabilising fields, creating a self-stable magnetic field. The phenomenon was driven by the system's desire to preserve magnetic helicity, which suggested a number of ways to improve the confinement time."]}, {"page": "Q3 Academy Langley", "response": ["* John Bryan Taylor (1928\u2013 ), Fondren Professor of Plasma Theory at the University of Texas at Austin, 1989\u201394; Chief Physicist at the Culham Laboratory, 1981\u201389"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Taylor", "response": ["* John Bryan Taylor (born 1929), English physicist"]}, {"page": "Taylor state", "response": ["*John Bryan Taylor"]}, {"page": "James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics", "response": ["| John Bryan Taylor"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|John Bryan Taylor||19/03/1970||"]}, {"page": "Derek Robinson (physicist)", "response": ["Robinson was put on the task of better understanding the nature of the turbulence, running a series of experiments to characterize it.
