He also taught at the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture.Watkin's main research interest was neoclassical architecture, particularly from the 18th century to the present day, and he published widely on that topic. He also published on general topics including A History of Western Architecture (4th ed. 2005) and English Architecture: A Concise History (2nd ed. 2001), as well as more specialised monographs on architects.

Inspired by religious music, the band sought to broaden their musical palette by utilising elaborate choral samples, the Mellotron, and other new instruments to create a more naturalistic, emotive sound. The artwork was designed by longtime OMD collaborator Peter Saville, along with Brett Wickens, while its title was derived from the book Morality and Architecture by David Watkin.", "According to the album's credits, its title was suggested to the band by Martha Ladly (formerly of Martha and the Muffins), who had read the 1977 book Morality and Architecture by David Watkin. Ladly was the girlfriend of Peter Saville, the album's sleeve designer, at the time. McCluskey felt the title Architecture & Morality represented the interplay between the human and mechanical aspects of OMD: \"We had the 'architecture', which was the technology, the drum machines, the rigid playing, the attempt to break out of the box by playing specifically crafted sounds, and the 'morality', the organic, the human, the emotional touch, which we brought naturally.\""]}, {"page": "Howard Colvin", "response": ["He is most notably the author of A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600\u20131840 which appeared in its original form in 1954.
