He later moved to Sheffield United where he enjoyed the most prolific spell of his career, making over 100 appearances for the Blades and playing in the top tier of English football. He subsequently moved to Notts County for whom he also played over 100 games before finishing his career playing for a number of non-league teams.

He was then sold to Sheffield United, just relegated from the Second Division, for a fee of \u00a325,000. He first appeared for Sheffield United in an 8\u20131 friendly victory against Skegness Town. His first league goal came in the Third Division in the opening game of the season against Reading but his hero status did not really start until 17 September, when both he and Tony Agana hit hat-tricks in a 6\u20131 victory over Chester City. It was the first double hat-trick by Blades players since Harry Johnson and Arthur Mercer helped the Blades achieve their record 11\u20132 victory over Cardiff City on 1 January 1926. His goals helped the Blades win promotion as Third Division runners-up that season, and followed this up with a second successive promotion a year later which saw the club return to the First Division after 14 years away."]}, {"page": "Leek Town F.C.", "response": ["|Tony Agana (caretaker)"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 in English football", "response": ["12 November 1991 \u2013 First Division strugglers Notts County pay a club record \u00a3750,000 for Sheffield United striker Tony Agana."]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Tony Agana"]}, {"page": "History of Sheffield United F.C.", "response": ["Dave Bassett took charge on 21 January 1988 shortly before the club's relegation to the Third Division, via a loss in the playoffs against Bristol City.

With debts mounting and the club having made a loss of over \u00a3300,000, Turner was forced to sell key players such as White and Richard Wilkins. A terrible run of form when the club went three months without a win meant they were sucked into the relegation dogfight. Brighton & Hove Albion, with their own well documented troubles, had seemed destined for relegation for much of the season. But they climbed above Hereford on the penultimate day of the season, leaving the Bulls 24th and bottom of the entire Football League.  Both teams were level on points, and Hereford had a better goal difference, but the goals scored rule was in effect and Brighton had scored more goals. On 3 May 1997 the two clubs met in a relegation decider at Edgar Street, which was the subject of considerable media interest as one club would relegate the other. Hereford needed a win to survive while Brighton only required a draw thanks to their having scored more goals. A capacity crowd saw Hereford take the lead in the first half through an own goal by Kerry Mayo from Tony Agana's cross. Brighton equalised in the second half against the run of play through Robbie Reinelt, who snapped up the rebound after a shot crashed against the post. In the last minute Hereford had a chance to save themselves but leading scorer Adrian Foster shot weakly at the goalkeeper when one-on-one. The final whistle blew and Hereford were relegated after 25 years in the Football League. Graham Turner subsequently resigned as manager but withdrew his resignation after strong support from the board and supporters. The general belief around the club at the time was that the club were merely 'on loan' to the Conference, but it would prove to be a long road back."]}]}}
