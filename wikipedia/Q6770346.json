The title refers to Marillion's two distinct \"eras\" with lead singers Fish (1980\u20141988) and Steve Hogarth (since 1989). By the time this compilation was released, both line-ups had recorded four studio albums each. The second best-of since the 14-track one-disc compilation A Singles Collection (known as Six of One, Half a Dozen of the Other in the US) from 1992, this one additionally contains material from Brave (1994) and Afraid of Sunlight (1996). Two different covers were created for the compilation, one by Mark Wilkinson, who had worked for the band during the Fish years, and one by Bill Smith Studio, who took over after Fish's and Wilkinson's departure. The booklet was printed so that either of the covers could be displayed in the jewel case according to personal preference. The track list, comprising 29 songs, was put together by Lucy Jordache, then the manager responsible for the band in EMI, in close collaboration with the band's fans' mailing list, \"Freaks\" (named after the eponymous song). Jordache also motivated singers Fish and Hogarth to contribute liner notes\u2014at a time when both camps were not yet on friendly terms again\u2014by telling each of them the other had already agreed to do so.Big George Webley, \"Marillion: Doing Business With Their Fans\", Sound on Sound, September 2003, retrieved 8 August 2013."]}, {"page": "Wilkinson (surname)", "response": ["* Mark Wilkinson (disambiguation)", "** Mark Wilkinson, British album cover artist", "** Wilkinson (musician) (born 1989), Mark Wilkinson, British Dj and producer better known by the stage name Wilkinson", "** Mark Wilkinson (designer), carpenter, furniture designer, founder of MWF FURNITURE U.K."]}, {"page": "Out of the Silent Planet (song)", "response": ["The single features two live tracks from the 1999 Ed Hunter tour, which featured the band reunited with guitarist Adrian Smith and vocalist Bruce Dickinson, as well as the promotional video for \"Out of the Silent Planet.\" Cover art was by Mark Wilkinson.

He launched the Unfitted Kitchen in 1984. Made from freestanding furniture, this was an unorthodox idea for its time.  The now-widespread use of willow baskets as drawers was first invented by Grey in the Unfitted Kitchen. Willow baskets in cabinetry were registered for copyright by Grey jointly with Smallbone in 1987, though Mark Wilkinson objected that basketry can be traced to historic African applications."]}, {"page": "Mark R Wilkinson OBE", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Wilkinson (designer)"]}, {"page": "Mark Wilkinson OBE", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Wilkinson (designer)"]}, {"page": "Mark Wilkinson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Mark Wilkinson (born 1952) is an English cover art designer and illustrator.", "* Mark Wilkinson (designer) (1950\u20132017), English furniture designer", "* Mark Wilkinson (singer), English-born Australian singer-songwriter", "* Mark Wilkinson (rugby union) (born 1977), English former rugby union player", "* Wilkinson (musician) (born 1989), Mark Wilkinson, British Dj and producer better known by the stage name Wilkinson"]}, {"page": "2017 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Mark Wilkinson, 66, furniture designer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2017", "response": ["*Mark Wilkinson, 66, English furniture designer, pancreatic cancer.Popular designer dies after cancer battle"]}]}}
