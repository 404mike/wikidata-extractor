They took their name from an Elvis Presley film title. The band was signed to the London-based, but Japanese owned, Vinyl Japan UK Ltd. The band first gained attention in Europe when they released their EP \"Hospital, Heaven or Hell\" which received praise from well-known English radio personalities John Peel and Steve Lamacq. Because of this, they recorded six John Peel Sessions which were released throughout the 1990s and eventually released together in 2000 on a double album, The Six John Peel Sessions."]}]}}
