They held radio slots on South London's inconsistent pirate station \"Desire FM\" before moving to 2GFM before the split of Fearless Crew in 2002.

The track starts flowing into a \"widescreen reverb heavy fog\" containing sustained and echo-filtered vocals before the instrumental turns minimalist again, a structure compared by Simon Edmunds of contactmusic.com to the \"old loud/quiet/loud trick\" that was prominent in many tracks by rock band Nirvana. \"Control\" is the only cut on the release to have a 2-step drum rhythm, unlike the EP's three other tracks that are driven by four-on-the-floor drum beats. The Face closes with the most playful cut on the EP, the balearic techno song \"Lividup\".
