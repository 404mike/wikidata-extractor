The mix-up probably comes from the fact that \"Doppelganger\" was the first episode of the season to be filmed, and thus carries an internal production number of 401 at the studio.

In the following episode, his crew discover Wexford is so determined to kill the Abnormal he is willing to kill Magnus if she is in the way. Because of his reckless command, Magnus eventually overrules him and retakes command of the Sanctuary Network. In the next episode, because he broke several protocols, including firing at a passenger yacht, he is relieved of command from the New York Sanctuary. Paul McGillion stated that Wexford is \"a lot more evil than I thought he would've been\", but added \"it's a really fun character to play, it's always fun playing villains\".
