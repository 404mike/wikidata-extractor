I think they've probably got a grip on our party.\" An all-party group of Lords led by the former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, said her \"irresponsible and inappropriate\" comments \"evoked a classic anti-Jewish conspiracy theory.\" Defending her comments, Tonge said that Walt and Mearsheimer's article \"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\" that appeared in the 23 March 2006 issue of The London Review of Books provided evidence supporting her assertion that the \"'Israel lobby' had a disproportionate voice in Anglo-American foreign policy.\" Tonge was reprimanded by the Liberal Party leader Menzies Campbell, who commented \"I defend absolutely your right to express your views on the Middle East, including legitimate criticism of the state of Israel. But I do not believe that the remarks you used fell within that category.\" He added that the remarks had \"clear anti-Semitic connotations\" Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, was quoted as saying: \"If someone makes comments that are so at odds with what the party feels, and hopefully at odds with common decency, then one would hope that they are no longer made welcome in the party itself.\"", "In a December 2007 column, after the 2007 Labour party donation scandal (\"Donorgate\") broke, Assaf Uni of Haaretz wrote that there was concern in the Jewish community about \"conspiracy theories regarding a 'Jewish plot' in the United Kingdom, and the role of the pro-Israel lobby there\". In late 2007, it was revealed that David Abrahams, deputy chair of Labour Friends of Israel until 2002, had made secret and illegal donations through junior employees of 600,000 pounds sterling (approximately $1.2 million) to the Labour Party. Abrahams, \"a Jewish millionaire\", admitted in The Jewish Chronicle that he concealed his activity because \"I didn't want Jewish money and the Labour Party being put together.\" The Daily Telegraph ran a photograph of Abrahams with Israeli former ambassador to Britain, Zvi Heifetz, and \"insinuated that Israel was the source of the illegal campaign contributions.\" According to an article in Haaretz, several in the media have maintained there was a connection between money donated by Zionist Jews and the pro-Israel policy of British prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, told The Forward, \"Clearly there is a potential for it to turn against us.\" Writing about the scandal, journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown asked in The Independent about the roles of the Labour and Conservative Friends of Israel groups, given that former Labour Friends leader David Abrahams was involved. She questioned the role in Labour victories of Jon Mendelsohn, noting that Mendelsohn is \"a passionate Zionist and infamous lobbyist, described by The Jewish Chronicle as \"one of the best-connected power brokers\".\" She stated her assumption that Labour Friends of Israel plays a part in shaping British foreign policies in the Middle East. She also questioned the donations and \"back-room influence\" of Labour Friends of India and Muslim Friends of Labour."]}, {"page": "Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel", "response": ["When the Church of England Synod passed its motion of support for EAPPI, it was criticised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews.
