The novelist Anthony Burgess commended him: \"Very intelligent, also witty, with a wide stretch of subject matter and a great boldness.\" The playwright and novelist Michael Frayn wrote, \"I think of all the living poets whose work I know Anthony Thwaite speaks to me most strongly and intimately. He writes with simplicity and precision about difficult and ambiguous things....the vastness and richness of the past, the elusiveness of the present - and the heroic persistence of our efforts to fix some trace of all this.\" Thwaite was pleased to be called  \"a fine comic poet\" by Sean O'Brien. One of his best light poems was included by Christopher Ricks in his Oxford Book of English Verse, and Thwaite is also well represented in Larkin's Oxford Book of Twentieth Century Verse. Tobias Hill called him \"a master of domestic disquiet\" in The Times, reviewing his Collected Poems (2007). He wrote: \"This is spectacular poetry.

A shortlist of six was selected by Rachel Cooke, Katie Derham and Tobias Hill, and revealed in London on 25 March 2010 when voting commenced on the Man Booker Prize website.
