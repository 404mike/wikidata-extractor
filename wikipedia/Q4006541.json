Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse, written while expecting her first child, remained in print throughout her life from its publication in 1939.\nHer classic stories often involved brave creatures who overcome trials and cruelty in the outside world before finding a loving home.  They included The Good Little Christmas Tree of 1943, and Gobbolino, the Witch's Cat first published the previous year.  It immediately sold out but disappeared until re-issued in abridged form by Kaye Webb at Puffin Books twenty years later, when it became a best-seller.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Ursula Moray Williams (1911\u20132006) \u2013 Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse, Gobbolino the Witch's Cat"]}, {"page": "1911 in literature", "response": ["**Ursula Moray Williams, English children's writer (died 2006)"]}, {"page": "1938 in literature", "response": ["*Ursula Moray Williams \u2013 Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse"]}, {"page": "1939 in literature", "response": ["*Ursula Moray Williams \u2013 Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse"]}, {"page": "1942 in literature", "response": ["*Ursula Moray Williams \u2013 Gobbolino, the Witch's Cat"]}, {"page": "Stanley Unwin (publisher)", "response": ["The publisher Thomas Fisher Unwin was his father's youngest stepbrother, therefore Stanley Unwin's step-uncle.
