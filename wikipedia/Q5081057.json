According to Payne, de Botton argues that religion provides useful boundaries, in addition to inspiring a sense of awe. Payne praises de Botton's prose and charm, but notes that de Botton seems to find libertarianism distasteful.  Payne describes the book as being both prescriptive and optimistic, but sums it up in the book's central premisethe hope that religion can be made to \"really suit us\". Charles Moore, writing for The Telegraph, states that de Botton's purpose in the book is to study religions and learn from them.  Moore states that de Botton \"has an instinctively religious grasp of the power of paradox\" in that the concept of original sin is depicted in the book as \"comforting\".  Moore suggests that de Botton knows that his suggested secular solutions to the problems of life are \"mostly a bit silly\", and notes that while de Botton discusses failed attempts at secular religion, like August De Comte's, de Botton \"does not seem to ask himself why\" they failed.
