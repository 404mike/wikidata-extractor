The boot room connection was finally broken in 1991, 32 years after Shankly's arrival, with the appointment of Graeme Souness, who actually demolished the boot room itself to make way for a press room. It did still manage to produce a final Liverpool manager in Roy Evans, who won the League Cup, but upon his resignation in 1998, the era was over."]}]}}
