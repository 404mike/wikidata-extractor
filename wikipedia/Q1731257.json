He held post-doctoral appointments at the University of Durham and University of Cambridge before moving to the Anglo-Australian Observatory, where he played a central role in supporting the 2dF galaxy survey as its instrument scientist. He moved to Johns Hopkins University in 2000 where he was Professor of Astronomy until 2006, at which time he became Professor of Astronomy at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. His work has been cited over 40,000 times in the literature of astronomy.\nGlazebrook also developed the open-source Perl Data Language, a perl-based alternative to the commercial IDL.\nGlazebrook was one of the leaders of the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS) which measured the evolution of galaxies using Gemini Observatory and the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. The project, along with a number of other studies, determined in 2004 that massive galaxies formed surprisingly early in the distant Universe, explaining why a lot of them appear so remarkably old. As a whimsical side-project Glazebrook also determined that the bulk-averaged color of the Universe is Cosmic latte. Both pieces of work received wide publicity in the international press. The bulk-averaged color earned some additional international publicity because a software bug had initially suggested a pale turquoise instead of the bland beige. He is also well known in the astronomical community for his pioneering work in developing the baryon oscillation technique to use the distribution of galaxies as a probe of dark energy.\nAfter his move to Australia he played a leading role in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey between 2006 and 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeline of programming languages", "response": ["| Karl Glazebrook, Jarle Brinchmann, Tuomas Lukka, and Christian Soeller"]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| Karl Glazebrook || UK || 1965 ||  || Determined that the average color of the universe is Cosmic Latte", "*Karl Glazebrook (UK, 1965\u2013)"]}, {"page": "Swinburne University of Technology", "response": ["| Karl Glazebrook || Laureate Fellow of the Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing || "]}, {"page": "Meanings of minor planet names: 10001\u201311000", "response": ["| 10099 Glazebrook ||  || Karl Glazebrook (born 1965), an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University. || "]}, {"page": "Cosmic latte", "response": ["Cosmic latte is the average color of the universe, found by a team of astronomers from Johns Hopkins University.

At the end of his program in 1988, he briefly did research at Princeton University and Institute for Advanced Study; the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and the Space Telescope Science Institute before accepting a tenured professorship at Rice University in the space, physics, and astronomy department. He held this role until 1993, when he took another research fellowship, this time at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. Later that year, he moved to Australia and joined the Anglo-Australian Observatory in Sydney as a physicist until 2000, when he became the Head of Instrument Science. He was awarded with a ARC Federation Fellow Professorship in 2007 and left the Observatory to teach physics and work as Director of the Sydney Institute for Astronomy (SIfA) within the University of Sydney's School of Physics. In 2008, he was awarded the Muhlmann Award from the ASP and shared the inaugural Group Achievement Award from the Royal Astronomical Society with 33 groupmates including John A. Peacock, Warrick Couch, and Karl Glazebrook."]}]}}
