Among the first students were Delabere Pritchett Blaine and Bracy Clark. In its early years it was mainly concerned with horses, but the range of animals covered gradually increased. The original building was a quadrangle in a neoclassical style, and there was a paddock on the opposite side of Royal College Street, but this was later sold for housing development."]}, {"page": "Royal Army Veterinary Corps", "response": ["In 1795 a veterinary surgeon, William Stockley, was appointed on a trial basis for six months to the 1st Fencible Cavalry Regiment. The experiment was a success, and in April the following year a Board of Cavalry Officers recommended that a veterinary surgeon should be attached to each regiment of cavalry, agreeing to defray the costs of three years' training for up to six men per year at the recently-established Veterinary College of London. At the same time, Edward Coleman, Principal of the Veterinary College, was appointed 'Principal Veterinary Surgeon to the Cavalry and Veterinary Surgeon to the Board of Ordnance'. With regard to the cavalry, his duties were to recommend veterinary surgeons for regimental appointments, and to inspect the horses of regiments 'when ordered to do so by the Commander-in-Chief or by the commanding Officers'. He was also contracted to supply 'Horse Medicines', and, as Principal of the College, was closely involved in the process of veterinary training and in keeping surgeons abreast of new developments. With regard to the Board of Ordnance, he was in attendance at Woolwich (where the military establishment of the Ordnance was based) once a week, to give professional assistance in the purchase of artillery horses, advice to the resident veterinary surgeon in 'extraordinary cases', and instructions to farriers on shoeing. It was on his advice that some stables at Woolwich were set aside to serve as a hospital, and he appointed John Percivall as his assistant to reside there.", "In 1805 a sizeable Veterinary Establishment was opened on Woolwich Common to see to the equine needs of the Royal Artillery (whose Barracks were nearby). Later known as the Royal Horse Infirmary, it went on to function as a hospital, veterinary store and centre of veterinary research. John Percivall was provided with quarters there; and in 1816 he took over as Senior Veterinary Surgeon of the Ordnance from Edward Coleman (the latter remaining P.V.S. to the Army until his death more than 20 years later).", "* 1796\u20131839: Professor Edward Coleman ", "* 1796\u20131816: Professor Edward Coleman"]}, {"page": "Edward Coleman", "response": ["Edward Coleman may refer to:", "*Edward Coleman (martyr), victim of the Titus Oates plot", "*Edward Coleman (gangster) (died 1839), Irish gang founder in New York City", "*Edward Coleman (miner) (1830\u20131913), California Gold Rush mine manager, president and superintendent", "*Edward Coleman (veterinary surgeon) (1766\u20131839), English veterinary surgeon", "*Edward Coleman (cricketer) (1891\u20131917), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Bracy Clark", "response": ["Clark specialised in conditions of horses' hooves, and in 1806 patented a new pattern horse shoe;No 2913 of 26 March 1806 he was then in practice at Giltspur Street, London.
