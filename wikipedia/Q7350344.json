His first language was Welsh.  As a young man he was influenced by Silyn Roberts (1871\u20131930), the Welsh poet, social reformer and early ILP supporter, who was Minister of the Calvinistic Methodist chapel at Tanygrisiau in Blaenau Ffestiniog from 1905 to 1912.He was elected at the 1922 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Caernarvonshire, having unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1918. He was defeated at the 1923 general election by the Liberal Party candidate Goronwy Owen, and although he stood again for Caernarvonshire in 1924 and 1929, he was never returned to the House of Commons.Jones served on the TUC General Council from 1921 to 1932.  From 1908 to 1933, he was General Secretary of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Douglas-Pennant, 2nd Baron Penrhyn", "response": ["As an opponent of trade unionism, Lord Penrhyn refused to allow the intervention of outsiders in dealings with his men, and late in 1900 a second general strike began, known as the Great Strike. The quarries were again closed, but were re-opened after a prolonged stoppage with 600 of the former  non-union workmen. Penrhyn refused to re-engage the ringleaders or to recognise any trade union officials. On 9 August 1901, Robert Thomas Jones, raised a discussion as a matter of urgent public importance on the conduct of the local magistrates in requisitioning cavalry for maintaining peace in the district, but Penrhyn's position was unaffected. On 13 March 1903, he brought an action for libel against William John Parry, in respect of an article in the Clarion, accusing him of cruelty to his workmen; he received \u00a3500 damages and costs. Penrhyn acted throughout in accordance with what he believed to be stern equity and from a wish to obtain justice for non-union men. In 1907, he gave his workmen a bonus of 10 per cent on their wages, owing to a spell of bad weather which had interrupted work at the quarries."]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Robert Thomas Jones, Caernarvonshire, 1922\u201323"]}, {"page": "Robert Jones", "response": ["* Robert Thomas Jones (engineer) (1910\u20131999), NASA aeronautical engineer"]}, {"page": "1940 in Wales", "response": ["**Robert Thomas Jones, quarrymen's leader, 66"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who only sat in the 32nd Parliament", "response": ["*Robert Thomas Jones (Labour, Caernarvonshire)"]}, {"page": "General Council of the Trades Union Congress", "response": ["|rowspan=6| Robert Thomas Jones"]}, {"page": "Robert Thomas Jones", "response": ["Robert Thomas Jones may refer to:", "* Robert Thomas Jones (engineer) (1910\u20131999), aerodynamicist and aeronautical engineer"]}]}}
