His book A Course in Phonetics is a common introductory text in phonetics, and The Sounds of the World's Languages (co-authored with Ian Maddieson) is widely regarded as a standard phonetics reference. Ladefoged also wrote several books on the phonetics of African languages. Prior to UCLA, he was a lecturer at the universities of Edinburgh, Scotland (1953\u201359, 1960\u20131) and Ibadan, Nigeria (1959\u201360).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Allophone", "response": ["Peter Ladefoged, a renowned phonetician, clearly explains the consonant allophones of English in a precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior. Some of these rules apply to all the consonants of English; the first item on the list deals with consonant length, items 2 through 18 apply to only selected groups of consonants, and the last item deals with the quality of a consonant.

The IPA and authors such as Peter Ladefoged equate phonemically contrastive murmur with breathy voice in which the vocal folds are held with lower tension (and further apart) than in modal voice, with a concomitant increase in airflow and slower vibration of the glottis. In that model, murmur is a point in a continuum of glottal aperture between modal voice and breath phonation (voicelessness)."]}, {"page": "International Phonetic Alphabet", "response": ["* Nasalization, as in Palantla Chinantec lightly nasalized  vs heavily nasalized ,Peter Ladefoged (1971) Preliminaries of Linguistic Phonetics, p. 35. though in extIPA the latter indicates velopharyngeal frication."]}, {"page": "Manner of articulation", "response": ["The concept of manner is mainly used in the discussion of consonants, although the movement of the articulators will also greatly alter the resonant properties of the vocal tract, thereby changing the formant structure of speech sounds that is crucial for the identification of vowels. For consonants, the place of articulation and the degree of phonation of voicing are considered separately from manner, as being independent parameters. Homorganic consonants, which have the same place of articulation, may have different manners of articulation. Often nasality and laterality are included in manner, but some phoneticians, such as Peter Ladefoged, consider them to be independent."]}, {"page": "Phonetics", "response": ["Before the widespread availability of audio recording equipment, phoneticians relied heavily on a tradition of practical phonetics to ensure that transcriptions and findings were able to be consistent across phoneticians. This training involved both ear training\u2014the recognition of speech sounds\u2014as well as production training\u2014the ability to produce sounds. Phoneticians were expected to learn to recognize by ear the various sounds on the International Phonetic Alphabet and the IPA still tests and certifies speakers on their ability to accurately produce the phonetic patterns of English (though they have discontinued this practice for other languages). As a revision of his visible speech method, Melville Bell developed a description of vowels by height and backness resulting in 9 cardinal vowels. As part of their training in practical phonetics, phoneticians were expected to learn to produce these cardinal vowels in order to anchor their perception and transcription of these phones during fieldwork. This approach was critiqued by Peter Ladefoged in the 1960s based on experimental evidence where he found that cardinal vowels were auditory rather than articulatory targets, challenging the claim that they represented articulatory anchors by which phoneticians could judge other articulations."]}, {"page": "Phonation", "response": ["In linguistic phonetic treatments of phonation, such as those of Peter Ladefoged, phonation was considered to be a matter of points on a continuum of tension and closure of the vocal cords. More intricate mechanisms were occasionally described, but they were difficult to investigate, and until recently the state of the glottis and phonation were considered to be nearly synonymous.Ladefoged, Peter& Ian Maddieson. (1996). The Sounds of the World's Languages. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell."]}, {"page": "Vowel", "response": ["This conception of vowel articulation has been known to be inaccurate since 1928. Peter Ladefoged has said that \"early phoneticians... thought they were describing the highest point of the tongue, but they were not. They were actually describing formant frequencies.\"Ladefoged & Disner (2012) Vowels and Consonants, 3rd ed., p. 132. (See below.) The IPA Handbook concedes that \"the vowel quadrilateral must be regarded as an abstraction and not a direct mapping of tongue position.\"IPA (1999) Handbook of the IPA, p. 12.", "In the third edition of his textbook, Peter Ladefoged recommended using plots of F1 against F2\u00a0\u2013\u00a0F1 to represent vowel quality.Ladefoged, Peter (1993) A Course in Phonetics (Third Edition), Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, p. 197. However, in the fourth edition, he changed to adopt a simple plot of F1 against F2,Ladefoged, Peter (2001) A Course in Phonetics (Fourth Edition), Fort Worth: Harcourt, p. 177. and this simple plot of F1 against F2 was maintained for the fifth (and final) edition of the book.Ladefoged, Peter (2006) A Course in Phonetics (Fifth Edition), Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, p. 189. Katrina Hayward compares the two types of plots and concludes that plotting of F1 against F2\u00a0\u2013\u00a0F1 \"is not very satisfactory because of its effect on the placing of the central vowels\",Hayward, Katrina (2000) Experimental Phonetics, Harlow, UK: Pearson, p. 160. so she also recommends use of a simple plot of F1 against F2. In fact, this kind of plot of F1 against F2 has been used by analysts to show the quality of the vowels in a wide range of languages, including RP, the Queen's English,Harrington, Jonathan, Sallyanne Palethorpe and Catherine Watson (2005) Deepening or lessening the divide between diphthongs: an analysis of the Queen's annual Christmas broadcasts.

Its position creates different vibration patterns to distinguish voiced and voiceless sounds.\"Laver, John Principles of Phonetics, 1994, Cambridge University Press In addition, the pitch of the vowel is changed by altering the frequency of vibration of the vocal folds. In some languages there are contrasts among vowels with different phonation types.\"Peter Ladefoged and Ian Maddieson The Sounds of the World's Languages, 1996, Blackwell; "]}, {"page": "Endangered language", "response": ["Generally the accelerated pace of language endangerment is considered to be a problem by linguists and by the speakers. However, some linguists, such as the phonetician Peter Ladefoged, have argued that language death is a natural part of the process of human cultural development, and that languages die because communities stop speaking them for their own reasons. Ladefoged argued that linguists should simply document and describe languages scientifically, but not seek to interfere with the processes of language loss. A similar view has been argued at length by linguist Salikoko Mufwene, who sees the cycles of language death and emergence of new languages through creolization as a continuous ongoing process.Mufwene, Salikoko (2004). \"Language birth and death\". Annual Review of Anthropology 33: 201\u2013222.Mufwene, Salikoko (2008). Language Evolution: Contact, Competition and Change. Continuum International Publishing Group."]}]}}
