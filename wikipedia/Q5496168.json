Rogers started his career at amateur side Helsby Athletic before he signed professional terms with Liverpool. He signed for Liverpool in 1934, but only made 7 appearances during those years, as he was unable to displace Matt Busby and Tom Morrison in the side. He made more appearances in the 1937\u201338 season appearing 24 times for the club. A further 30 appearances were made the following season, which was to be his last at the club. The Second World War interrupted his career, as he never played for Liverpool after the war.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick Rogers", "response": ["*Fred Rogers (1928\u20132003), American educator, clergyman, songwriter, author, and television host", "*Fred Rogers (American football) (fl. 1890s), American college football coach", "*Fred Rogers (footballer) (1910\u2013?), English footballer", "*Fred Rogers (cricketer) (1918-1998), New Zealand cricketer"]}, {"page": "Fred Rogers (soccer)", "response": ["#redirect Fred Rogers (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Fred Rogers (soccer player)", "response": ["#redirect Fred Rogers (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Fred Rogers (association football player)", "response": ["#redirect Fred Rogers (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Fred Rogers (association football)", "response": ["#redirect Fred Rogers (footballer)"]}]}}
