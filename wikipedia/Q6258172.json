He is a barrister and deputy coroner, and was nominally made chairman and owner of two-thirds of Derby County in October 2003, in a move arranged by Murdo Mackay. There were also two other directors, Jeremy Keith, who owned one-third of the club, and Steve Harding. Mackay soon became more formally involved by Sleightholme, and he was promoted to director of football.\nIn early 2006, the club was facing a boardroom battle between Sleightholme and Keith. Following protests by the Rams Protest Group and RamsTrust, it didn't seem that Sleightholme and Keith would be chairman and chief executive respectively for much longer and, indeed, in April 2006, Sleightholme resigned, stating \"My position has been made untenable. Recently it has come to my attention that meetings have been held, important decisions taken and documents signed without my knowledge. Important information has been withheld from me.\" Keith himself departed later in the month, to be replaced by a new board led by Peter Gadsby.In March 2009, Sleightholme gave evidence in the court case against Jeremy Keith, Murdo Mackay, Derby County's former finance director Andrew MacKenzie, accountant Mark Waters and solicitor David Lowe who were all charged in relation to a fraud allegation centred on a loan from a Panama-based company that effectively saved Derby County after their relegation from the Premiership. Mackenzie, Keith, Mackay and Lowe were subsequently jailed for their involvement. Neither Sleightholme or Steve Harding, were implicated in the fraud, not charged with any offence, while Waters was found innocent", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pride Park Stadium", "response": ["Although the financing of the stadium's construction was carefully structured so that the club paid and owned the ground without encroaching on funds reserved for the development of the team, the club's eventual relegation from the top flight in 2002 saw it enter financial crisis and eventually it was temporarily entered into receivership by The Co-operative Bank, who instantly installed a new board composed of John Sleightholme, Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding, for the cost of \u00a31 each. Financial circumstances worsened as the debt spiralled to \u00a330\u00a0million plus and an unpopular refinancing scheme was put in place which saw the stadium sold to the \"mysterious\" Panama-based ABC Corporation and the club paying rent of \u00a31\u00a0million a year to play there, which local journalist Gerald Mortimer described as \"an affront ... to those who put everything into building [the ground]\". The ownership trio of Sleightholme, Keith and Harding were dubbed \"The Three Amigos\" and, after came under increasing criticism from the Derby's support, in the form of two separate supporters groups, the RamsTrust and the Rams Protest Group (RPG), they eventually sold out to a group of local businessmen, dubbed \"The League of Gentlemen\" by the local press, led by former board member Peter Gadsby, in April 2006. The Gadsby-led consortium returned Pride Park to club ownership. Three years later, Murdo Mackay, Jeremy Keith and finance director Andrew McKenzie were charged with taking a secret commission worth \u00a3440,625 from the club and were sentenced to a combined seven-and-a-half years in prison. As of August 2009, the club still owed \u00a315\u00a0million on the mortgage of the Pride Park Stadium which was later revealed to be due to be paid off in 2016."]}, {"page": "Lightwater Valley", "response": ["On 21 June 2001, 20-year-old Gemma Savage died following an accident the previous day when two carriages collided on Treetop Twister, a spinning Wild Mouse roller coaster, which had opened in May of that year. Police decided not to prosecute a maintenance worker, who claimed that he had only received an hour of training on the ride and had not seen its manual. Faulty wiring had also caused a malfunction on the ride. In October 2004, Deputy Coroner John Sleightholme at Skipton Magistrates' Court ruled death by misadventure."]}, {"page": "Murdo Mackay", "response": ["In October 2003 Mackay became involved in a takeover over of financially troubled Football League First Division club Derby County. A group of investors who wished to remain anonymous had purchased the club following it being placed into temporary receivership by the Co-operative Bank, and had installed barrister John Sleightholme as chairman. Sleightholme was a friend of Mackay's, the two being the only directors of a company called Finance for Football, which had been launched in 2002. Mackay's role at Derby was initially unspecified, although it was thought that he helped with attracting investment. He was subsequently appointed to the director of football role, and with his contacts in international football was instrumental in recruiting players such as Grzegorz Rasiak and I\u00f1igo Idiakez for the club."]}, {"page": "Lionel Pickering", "response": ["In October 2003, Derby County's parent company, Derby County Limited, briefly went into liquidation and Pickering, the majority shareholder, gave way to a new board of John Sleightholme, Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding, who bought the club for \u00a33.
