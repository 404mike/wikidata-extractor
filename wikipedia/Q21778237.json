He originated the Total Abstinence Society and was founder and first president of the Society for the Study and Cure of Inebriety which was founded in 1884.In his writings he insisted on regarding inebriety as a disease and not a vice: \"a disease of the nervous system allied to insanity\", an \"abnormal condition, in which morbid cravings and impulses to intoxication are apt to be developed in such force as to overpower the moral resistance and control.\"\n\nIn 1890 in a conference held in Christiania he coined the term \"narcomania\" for this illness.His influential textbook on \"Inebriety or Narcomania\" was first published in 1888 and went through three editions. Note that while 'inebriate' originally described a person intoxicated with alcohol, it later came to include other intoxicating drugs, especially narcotics, such as opium, chlorodyne, ether, chloral, chloroform or cocaine.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1873 and was also a member of the Obstetrical and Medical Societies of London, the Harveian Society and British Medical Association, being elected to the General Council for the Metropolitan branch.", "link_mentions": []}}
