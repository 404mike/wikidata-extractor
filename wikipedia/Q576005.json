She was a free-born black woman from Pennsylvania who was working as a schoolteacher in South Carolina, instructing both slaves and freedmen, and wrote that she \"came home with the blues\" because she felt lonesome and pitied herself. She overcame her depression and later noted a number of songs, such as Poor Rosy, that were popular among the slaves. Although she admitted being unable to describe the manner of singing she heard, Forten wrote that the songs \"can't be sung without a full heart and a troubled spirit\", conditions that have inspired countless blues songs.Paul Oliver (1969), The Story of the Blues, Barrie & Rockliff, page 8.", "Reports of blues music in southern Texas and the Deep South were written at the dawn of the 20th century. Charles Peabody mentioned the appearance of blues music at Clarksdale, Mississippi, and Gate Thomas reported similar songs in southern Texas around 1901\u20131902. These observations coincide more or less with the recollections of Jelly Roll Morton, who said he first heard blues music in New Orleans in 1902; Ma Rainey, who remembered first hearing the blues in the same year in Missouri; and W.C. Handy, who first heard the blues in Tutwiler, Mississippi, in 1903. The first extensive research in the field was performed by Howard W. Odum, who published an anthology of folk songs from Lafayette County, Mississippi, and Newton County, Georgia, between 1905 and 1908.Evans, David. In Nothing but the Blues. pp. 33\u201335.

The form was collectively developed by generations and communities of enslaved African Americans starting as \"unaccompanied work-songs of the plantation culture\". The historical roots of the blues have been traced farther back to West African sources by scholars such as Paul Oliver and Gerhard Kubik\u2014with elements such as the \"responsorial 'leader-and-chorus' form\". The blues became the \"most extensively recorded of all traditional music types\" and since the \"early 1960s, \u2014the \"most important single influence on the development of Western popular music,\" and are now widespread.According to Paul Oliver in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \"From obscure and largely undocumented rural American origins...Influential in its development were the collective unaccompanied work-songs of the plantation culture, which followed a responsorial 'leader-and-chorus' form that can be traced not only to pre-Civil War origins but to African sources. Responsorial work-songs diminished when the plantations were broken up, but persisted in the southern penitentiary farms until the 1950s. After the Reconstruction era, black workers either engaged in seasonal collective labour in the South or tended smallholdings leased to them under the system of debt-serfdom known as sharecropping. Work-songs therefore increasingly took the form of solo calls or 'hollers', comparatively free in form but close to blues in feeling. The vocal style of the blues probably derived from the holler... Blues instrumental style shows tenuous links with African music. Drumming was forbidden on slave plantations, but the playing of string instruments was often permitted and even encouraged, so the musicians among slaves from the savanna regions, with their strong traditions of string playing, predominated. The jelli, or griots \u2013 professional musicians who also acted as their tribe\u2019s historians and social commentators \u2013 performed roles not unlike those of the later blues singers, while the banjo is thought to be a direct descendant of their banza or xalam. One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation work songs with their call-and-response format, and more especially the relatively free-form field hollers of the later sharecroppers, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues.\""]}, {"page": "Ida Cox", "response": ["The Rabbit Foot Minstrels, organized by F.
