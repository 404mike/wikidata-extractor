Throughout his career, Domett was under the patronage of Alexander Hood, later Lord Bridport. During his service Domett was appointed as flag captain by several admirals, and saw action numerous times in this capacity, including seven years in command of HMS Royal George. He went on to be First Naval Lord and then Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth during the closing stages of the Napoleonic Wars. Later in life, ill-health forced early retirement and Domett retired to his country estate in Hawkchurch, Devon, close to Lord Bridport's estates.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Copenhagen (1801)", "response": ["* London 98 (flag of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, with 1st Captain William Domett and 2nd Captain Robert Walker Otway)"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**William Domett, Naval Lord", "**William Domett, Naval Lord", "**William Domett, Naval Lord", "**William Domett, Naval Lord", "**William Domett, Naval Lord", "**William Domett, Naval Lord", "**William Domett, First Naval Lord", "**William Domett, First Naval Lord", "**William Domett, First Naval Lord"]}, {"page": "Battle of Groix", "response": ["In common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year,James, p. 181 rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail; the only officer commended was Bridport's own flag captain William Domett, whose ship had joined the action only in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the Parliament of Great Britain, which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner of Queen. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral John Colpoys of London, whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's.Clowes, p. 265 Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, William James noting that Douglas and Queen Charlotte were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain Anthony Molloy and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet."]}]}}
