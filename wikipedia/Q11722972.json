Paul Crossley has described him as \"the most prolific and arguably the most influential writer on Gothic architecture in the post-war years\". He made extensive use of archival sources, and is particularly remembered for having \u2013 through his study of Henry Yevele (1944), and his biographical dictionary of English Mediaeval Architects (1954) \u2013 helped dispel the myth that the architects of medieval buildings were anonymous figures of whom little could be discovered. He also published more generally on England in the later middle ages, and was a pioneer in the field of garden history.", "link_mentions": {}}}
