Paul Crossley has described him as \"the most prolific and arguably the most influential writer on Gothic architecture in the post-war years\". He made extensive use of archival sources, and is particularly remembered for having \u2013 through his study of Henry Yevele (1944), and his biographical dictionary of English Mediaeval Architects (1954) \u2013 helped dispel the myth that the architects of medieval buildings were anonymous figures of whom little could be discovered. He also published more generally on England in the later middle ages, and was a pioneer in the field of garden history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward the Black Prince", "response": ["The black field of his \"shield for peace\" is well documented (see Arms and heraldic badge above). However, there is no sound evidence that Edward ever wore black armour, although John Harvey (without citing a source) refers to \"some rather shadowy evidence that he was described in French as clad at the battle of Cr\u00e9cy ' en armure noire en fer bruni ' \u2013 in black armour of burnished steel\". Richard Barber suggests that the name's origins may have lain in pageantry, in that a tradition may have grown up in the 15th century of representing the prince in black armour. He points out that several chronicles refer to him as Edward the IV (the title he would have taken as King had he outlived his father): this name would obviously have become confusing when the actual Edward IV succeeded in 1461, and this may have been the period when an alternative had to be found."]}, {"page": "Architecture of cathedrals and great churches", "response": ["The earliest large churches date from Late Antiquity.

The stonework of its pointed arcades and fluted piers bears pronounced mouldings and carved capitals in a foliate, \"stiff-leaf\" style. Its Early English front with 300 sculpted figures, is seen as a \"supreme triumph of the combined plastic arts in England\". The east end retains much ancient stained glass.

Wells is the first cathedral in England to be built, from its foundation, in Gothic style. According to art historian John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings.
