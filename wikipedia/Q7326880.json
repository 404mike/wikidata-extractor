At the Barnsley by-election of 1897, Potts supported the Liberal Party candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal Party was the working man\u2019s only hope\".David Rubinstein, \"The Independent Labour Party and the Yorkshire Miners: The Barnsley By-Election of 1897\", What Next?; earlier published in International Review of Social History, Vol.23, 1978. In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts retained the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper."]}, {"page": "List of presidents of the Methodist Conference", "response": ["|Richard John Soper MP"]}]}}
