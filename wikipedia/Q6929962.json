Among his clients he counted David Bowie's first group, The Konrads, although the Konrads, unlike the Stones, \"never progressed beyond the suburban pub circuit\", says Sandford, and may not have been particularly interested in them.  Easton also ran Julie Grant\u2014whom Easton saw as a successor to Helen Shapiro\u2014and booked her to back the Stones on their first UK tour. Easton claimed to have managed the Dave Clark Five before the Stones, and organised their first American tour. His partnership with them, though, says Easton, ended because the group thought him to be concentrating too much on the Stones and not enough on them. Easton also managed Bert Weedon, Mrs Mills and the host of ITV's popular music show Thank Your Lucky Stars, Brian Matthew. Through Matthew, Easton had arranged the Stones' first TV appearance. Clayson says that Easton was \"respected and liked by his many prestigious artistes\" due to his background in the industry and the fact that he was committed to their long-term success. For example, for Weedon he had obtained a residency on the BBC's Billy Cotton Band Show, and Mills he obtained a place for on ITV's children's series, the Five O'Clock Club. According to Peter Townsend, Easton believed that the Stones' impact would be ephemeral and that it would be his other clients\u2014Grant, Weedon and Mills\u2014who would be his long-term investments. Easton, says Townsend, also had other sidelines to buffer him financially, telling Townsend, \"if this popular music business collapses, I'm not terribly worried. I've got a nice little income guaranteed; I hire out 20 organs to Butlins.\"thumb|upright=1.5|alt=scan of a magazine advert from Eric Easton Ltd|Christmas greetings from Eric Easton Ltd on behalf of a number of clients, published in Pop Weekly, 21 December 1963"]}, {"page": "Don't Bring Lulu", "response": ["* Mrs Mills (instrumental) (1962)"]}]}}
