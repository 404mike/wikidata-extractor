King Juan Carlos of Spain made him a Commander of the Order of Isabel La Cat\u00f3lica in 1988, and the University of Salamanca awarded him the Elio Antonio de Nebrija prize in 2007.

The painting is identified as The Giant in this inventory of goods The painting was later owned by Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez Dur\u00e1n, who bequeathed his collection to Madrid's Museo del Prado, where it has been kept since 1931.", "The large body of the giant occupies the centre of the composition. It appears to be adopting a fighting pose due to the position of its one visible arm and its clenched fist. The picture was painted during the Peninsular War so it could be a symbolic representation of that war. Nigel Glendinning states that the picture is based on a patriotic poem written by Juan Bautista Arriaza called Pyrenean Prophecy published in 1810.Juan Bautista Arriaza's poem \"Profec\u00eda del Pirineo\" (vv. 25-36) refers to a Titan that roams the Pyrenees, the etymology of the range means burnt mountain, which is reflected in traditional Spanish literature, such as in The Fable of Polifemo and Galatea by Luis de G\u00f3ngora; the giant Polifemo is called \"this Pyrenees\" in verse 62. Ariaza's poem describes details such as the clouds that surround the giant's waist, which are reflected in the painting:", " The poem represents the Spanish people as a giant arising from the Pyrenees in order to oppose the Napoleonic invasion. Goya's painting The Eagle, which was found in the possession of Goya's son in 1836, is similar in size and allegorical character to The Colossus. Nigel Glendinning considers this proof that Goya conceived of paintings with a similar concept to The Colossus.Nigel Glendinning, \"En torno al Coloso atribuido a Goya una vez m\u00e1s\", Goya. Revista de Arte, 329 (October - December 2009) , page 294.", "The technique used in this painting is similar to that used in Goya's Black Paintings, which were originally painted on the walls of Goya's house, Quinta del Sordo. A later date for the painting of the picture has even been suggested, which would mean that The Colossus mentioned in the inventory of 1812 is a different painting. However, Nigel Glendinning has refuted this later dating with arguments solely based on stylistic features of the painting. Glendinning argues that all the stylistic features found in The Colossus are already present (although not to the same degree) in Goya's previous paintings from The Meadow of San Isidro in 1788, which contains small figures painted with quick strokes; to Los Caprichos (1799) numbers 3 (Here comes the bogeyman) and 52 (What a tailor can do) for the theme of an oversized figure that is frightening.Cfr. los cited Caprichos; No. 3 Que viene el coco (Here comes the bogey-man) and No. 52 Lo que puede un sastre (What a tailor can do) As well as some drawings found in Goya's sketchbooks such as A giant figure on a balcony, A hooded giant and Proclamation Dream of the Witches (Gassier and Wilson No.s. 625, 633 and 638).", "The Goya expert Nigel Glendinning rejects the idea that the picture was painted by Asensio Juli\u00e1, stating that the arguments supporting Mena's views are \"totally subjective\" and that the brush strokes that Mena claims are the signature \"A. J.\" are actually the first digits of the inventory number 176 that is visible in old photographs of the painting. It is also possible to see other numbers in these old photographs such as the number 18 that is alluded to in the sentence \"A giant with the number eighteen\" used in a description of the painting A Giant which was the name used for the painting in the inventory of Goya's works carried out in 1812 after the death of the painters wife Josefa Bayeu.See also page 30 of the cited article (Glendinning, 2002): In 2012 Jesusa Vega published an article entitled \"The Colossus is by Francisco de Goya\" in which she shows how the strokes of various figure eights drawn by Goya correspond to those visible on The Colossus. Vega rejects the basic premise that initially threw doubt on Goya's authorship of the painting. In addition, she shows that the other findings of the study carried out by the Prado have all indicated that the picture was painted by Goya; these included the analysis of pigments and binders, assessment of the artistic techniques used and the theme and composition of the painting along with its similarity to Goya's other Black Paintings. In 2009 the art historian Valeriano Bozal, after seeing Mena's press release, stated that \"the report is not conclusive\".\"Bozal: \"If I was Director of the Prado I would not remove The Colossus\" (from the catalogue of Goya's works)\", ABC, 28, January 2009. He later unsuccessfully tried to hold a congress of international experts with the objective of arriving at a consensus, declaring in June 2010 that \"Goya's authorship has been removed on the basis of weak irrelevant evidence. The heritage of the painting has been mutilated without conclusive evidence\".\"Arte bajo sospecha\", El Pa\u00eds, 19 June 2010.

J. were the signature of Asensio Juli\u00e1, one of the main arguments supporting the attribution of the painting to the Valencian painter.\"Conclusi\u00f3n: goyesco s\u00ed, de Goya no\", El Pa\u00eds, 27-1-2009. In March 2009, Nigel Glendinning and Jesusa Vega published an article in the academic journal Goya entitled \"A failed attempt to delist The Colossus by the Prado Museum?\"Nigel Glendinning in collaboration with Jesusa Vega, \"\u00bfUn fracasado intento de descatalogar El coloso por el Museo del Prado?\", Goya.

In addition, they attribute The Milkmaid of Bordeaux to the goddaughter of painter Rosarito Weiss.  However, in an article entitled The problem of the allocations from the 1900 Goya Exposition Nigel Glendinning and the then-director of the Museo del Prado, Fernando Checa, reject these claims.\"Museum rejects Goya claims\", BBC News, 05-04-2001.\"La mujer que le quit\u00f3 'El Coloso' a Francisco de Goya\" , adn.es, 28 January 2009.\"Nigel Glendinning: \"El coloso y La lechera de Burdeos son de Goya y me enfada que lo nieguen sin demostrarlo\"\", ABC, 5-5-2002.

This conjunction of ideas would not have existed if The Colossus had been painted later, which is an argument that Glendinning uses to refute Bareau-Wilson and Mena's hypothesis. This hypothesis tries to distance the painting from the inventory of the estate of Goya's wife, Josefa Bayeu, on her death in 1812. The inventory lists a painting with the same dimensions as The Colossus, which is called A Giant and which has traditionally been identified as the same painting.", "In July 2009 Spanish universities and numerous Goya experts signed a declaration in support of Nigel Glendinning, defending the use of the scientific method in the study of art history and attributing The Colossus to Goya.<ref name = \"consensus2\"></Ref>"]}, {"page": "Fight with Cudgels", "response": ["The British researcher Nigel Glendinning had already remarked on the differences between the final detail of the Black Paintings and the detail documented by Jean Laurent, before the transfer from the wall of Goya's home.

In Feminine folly (#1), a doll thrown by women wears a military uniform. In Fearful folly (#2), a soldier runs away in terror from someone who has disguised himself in large, ghost-like sheets. Despite the fact that the face peeking out from a sleeve gives him away, the military man does not notice it.
