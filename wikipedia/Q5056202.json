After the war, The Times carried reports on matches played by both the Royal Navy and by the United Services team in which Thomson features, and he was \"one of the outstanding players\" in the trial match for the Scottish national side in January 1921. On 12 January 1921 The Times reported his name among those picked to play for Scotland against France as a centre. The match itself was not a success for Thomson: he \"was entirely out of form\" and \"mishandled the ball practically every time it came to him\", said the report of the match, a 3\u20130 win for France. Thomson retained his place in the Scotland team for the next match against Wales at St Helen's, Swansea and was the subject of comment in The Times: \"A. E. Thomson's mishandling of the ball was so atrocious that the Scottish selectors may, perhaps, be pardoned for assuming that his form was too bad to be real. One knows that he does possess the quality of pace.\" This match was won by Scotland and Thomson was the scorer of the first try; the report in The Times, which dwelt largely on pitch invasions that once brought the match to a halt and impeded play throughout, praised Thomson's speed, though again it said his handling was \"weak\". An ankle injury prevented Thomson playing in the next international match away to Ireland, when Scotland were beaten, but he was recalled for the final international of the season, the Calcutta Cup match against England at Inverleith. It was again not a happy experience: his miss of a pass let in the England wing three-quarter for a try, and the report in The Times said that both Thomson and his Royal Navy colleague Cecil MacKenzie, the other centre three-quarter, were \"entirely at sea, both in attack and defence\". Thomson did not play any further international rugby in subsequent seasons, though he continued to play for the United Services club, moving successfully to full back."]}]}}
