He became a royal academician in 1808, and presented as his diploma work \"Venus and Adonis\" (exhibited the same year), perhaps the best of his creative subjects, apart from \"Expulsion from Paradise\". Meanwhile, he rose steadily in public favour, and in 1806, painted the Prince of Wales, the Marchioness of Stafford, the \"Marquess of Stafford's Family\", and Lord Thurlow. In 1807 he sent to the Royal Academy the well-known portrait of William Blake, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, which was engraved in line by Luigi Schiavonetti, and later etched by William Bell Scott."]}, {"page": "John Soane", "response": ["In Rome Soane's circle now included Henry Tresham, Thomas Jones (artist) and Nathaniel Marchant.
