Several trans rights campaigners made a direct comparison between the Leckie and Bindel nominations. A similar demonstration was planned for the awards ceremony, but was cancelled after Stonewall withdrew the nomination. Writing in The Guardian, Natacha Kennedy argued Stonewall was \"holding back transgender equality\", highlighting the nomination and claiming that trans people are unable to join the organisation despite having been \"central to the 1969 Stonewall riots\", as well as criticising the use of the pejorative term \"tranny\" in Stonewall's anti-homophobia film Fit, aimed at secondary schools."]}, {"page": "Derek Ferguson", "response": ["His autobiography, Big Brother, written with Bill Leckie, was published in 2006."]}, {"page": "Leckie", "response": ["* Bill Leckie"]}, {"page": "Des McKeown", "response": ["In 2001, he was the subject of a book published by Mainstream Publishing entitled \"Don't Give Up the Day Job: A Year in the Life a Part-time Footballer\" written by Bill Leckie, which gave an insight into the difficulties of juggling work commitments and family life, whilst playing as a part-time professional footballer for Queen of the South F.C. in the Scottish League.
