The first substantial action occurred on the morning of 22 August. At  the 4th Royal Irish Dragoons laid an ambush for a patrol of German lancers outside the village of Casteau, to the north-east of Mons. When the Germans spotted the trap and fell back, a troop of the dragoons, led by Captain Hornby gave chase, followed by the rest of his squadron, all with drawn sabres. The retreating Germans led the British to a larger force of lancers, whom they promptly charged and Captain Hornby became the first British soldier to kill an enemy in the Great War, fighting on horseback with sword against lance. After a further pursuit of a few miles, the Germans turned and fired upon the Irish cavalry, at which point the dragoons dismounted and opened fire. Drummer E. Edward Thomas is reputed to have fired the first shot of the war for the British Army, hitting a German trooper.", "The Germans established the St Symphorien Military Cemetery as a memorial to the German and British dead. On a mound in the centre of the cemetery, a grey granite obelisk  tall was built with a German inscription: \"In memory of the German and English soldiers who fell in the actions near Mons on the 23rd and 24th August 1914.\" Originally,  and  soldiers were interred at the cemetery.

A tablet in the cemetery sets out the gift of the land by Jean Houzeau de Lehaie. A bronze tablet was erected on a wall of Obourg railway station, commemorating British soldiers who lost their lives around Obourg including an unnamed soldier who is said to have stayed behind at the cost of his own life, perched atop the station, in order to cover his withdrawing comrades. The small portion of the wall supporting the plaque was preserved when the rest of the building was demolished in 1980."]}, {"page": "Private John Parr", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Parr (British Army soldier)"]}, {"page": "Merle Hay", "response": ["*John Parr, the first British Army soldier killed, 1914"]}, {"page": "1914 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 21 August \u2013 World War I: reconnaissance cyclist Private John Parr (aged 17) becomes the first British soldier to be killed on the Western Front, at Obourg in Belgium."]}, {"page": "Obourg", "response": ["It is the site of the first British soldier to be killed in the First World War, Private John Parr on 21 August 1914."]}, {"page": "Thomas Enright", "response": ["*John Parr, the first British Army soldier killed, 1914"]}, {"page": "John Parr (soldier)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Parr (British Army soldier)"]}, {"page": "St Symphorien Military Cemetery", "response": ["Notable Commonwealth burials in the cemetery include John Parr and George Lawrence Price, traditionally believed to be the first and last Commonwealth soldiers killed in action during the First World War, and Maurice Dease, the first posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross of World War I.
