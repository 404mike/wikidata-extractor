Henry Marsh was typically as much as 20 metres back off the pace.  Renner opened up several metres on the Kenyans but with two laps to go, the field began bunching behind Renner with Brian Diemer, Joseph Mahmoud, Colin Reitz and Marsh back in the fold, all getting ready to pounce.  Just before the bell, Renner started to fall back.  Korir accelerated and Marsh was the first to follow, Diemer was next to catch up, followed by Mahmoud.  Through the final turn, Marsh looked like the only one still with any shot at Korir, but he was still losing ground.  Marsh was unable to make any headway as Mahmoud passed in on the outside, with Korir taking the final barrier as a hurdler and sprinting to victory.  Mahmoud sprinted away to the silver medal while Diemer challenged Marsh on the outside.  Diemer got the edge on Marsh with 10 metres to go, with the beaten Marsh just striding the final few steps over the line.", "| 5|| align=\"left\" | Colin Reitz || align=\"left\" |  ||  8:29.33||", "| 4|| align=\"left\" | Colin Reitz || align=\"left\" |  ||  8:18.62|| ", "| 5 || align=left| Colin Reitz || align=\"left\" |  || 8:15.48 ||"]}, {"page": "1982 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 9 || align=left | Colin Reitz || align=left |  || 8:28.87 || ", "| 4 || align=left | Colin Reitz || align=left |  || 8:23.86 || q"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 4|| align=\"left\" | Colin Reitz || align=\"left\" |  ||  8:35.21|| ", "| 8|| align=\"left\" | Colin Reitz || align=\"left\" |  ||  8:29.75||"]}, {"page": "1983 European Cup (athletics)", "response": ["| Colin Reitz || 8:25.72"]}, {"page": "Tom Hanlon (athlete)", "response": ["Tom Hanlon (born 20 May 1967) is a Scottish former athlete who competed mainly in the 3000 metres steeplechase.
