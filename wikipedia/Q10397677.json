He compensated for his lack of frontline action by often playing as a centre-back when either Ronnie McKinnon or Colin Jackson was injured, and when the duo were ruled out of the 1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, Johnstone (still only 18) deputised in the match against Dynamo Moscow."]}, {"page": "Flesherin", "response": ["Flesherin () is a small village on the Point peninsula of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides.
