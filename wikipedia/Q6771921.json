He began his career in 1994 with Premier League club Blackburn Rovers, he was part of the squad that went on to win the title in the 1994\u201395 season but didn't play a match all season. Whilst with Rovers he spent time on loan with Swindon Town, Queens Park Rangers and Grimsby Town. In September 2001 he notably scored the equaliser in Grimsby's 2\u20131 victory over Liverpool in the League Cup third round. He later went on to join Sheffield Wednesday permanently before moving on to Preston North End, Stoke City, Blackpool, Crewe Alexandra and Tranmere Rovers. He dropped out of the professional game at the end of the 2010\u201311 season where he signed for Clitheroe. His stay with the club was brief and he moved back up the leagues by joining Conference North side Altrincham. He left Alty at the conclusion of the 2011\u201312 season.

Grimsby's push for promotion faltered and the team's form declined rapidly, with Lawrence being dismissed halfway into the season. Paul Groves, the skipper, was chosen to replace him and he steered them to a 19th in the final table, enough to avoid relegation, but a disappointing end to a season which had begun so promisingly. The season was overshadowed by loanee Martin Pringle's footballing career being ended after a leg-breaking tackle by Stockport County defender Dave Challinor, This was also aggravated more by the referee Mike Dean only awarding Challinor a yellow card for the horrific career ending challenge., As well as the collapse of ITV Digital putting enormous strain on finances for the club.", "* Marlon Broomes"]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Marlon Broomes||||CB||2001||15||0"]}, {"page": "Lewis Neal", "response": ["Neal started his career at Stoke City, making his debut in the Football League Trophy on 6 December 2000 against Scarborough.

Beharall gave away the penalty that Liverpool midfielder Gary McAllister scored as he was judged to have handled the ball in the penalty box.
