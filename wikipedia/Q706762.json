Duckworth, a vicar's son, achieved much in a naval career that began at the age of 11.\nServing with most of the great names of the Royal Navy during the later 18th and early 19th centuries, he fought almost all of Britain's enemies on the seas at one time or another, including a Dardanelles operation that would be remembered a century later during the First World War. He was in command at the Battle of San Domingo, the last great fleet action of the Napoleonic Wars.", "link_mentions": {}}}
