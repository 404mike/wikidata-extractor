Duckworth, a vicar's son, achieved much in a naval career that began at the age of 11.\nServing with most of the great names of the Royal Navy during the later 18th and early 19th centuries, he fought almost all of Britain's enemies on the seas at one time or another, including a Dardanelles operation that would be remembered a century later during the First World War. He was in command at the Battle of San Domingo, the last great fleet action of the Napoleonic Wars.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 31", "response": ["*1817 \u2013 Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet, English admiral and politician, 39th Commodore Governor of Newfoundland (b. 1747)"]}, {"page": "February 9", "response": ["*1748 \u2013 Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet, English admiral and politician, Commodore Governor of Newfoundland (d. 1817)"]}, {"page": "1810 in Canada", "response": ["*Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland: Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet"]}]}}
