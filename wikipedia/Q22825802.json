The eldest daughter of the actor and filmmaker Richard Attenborough and the actress Sheila Sim, she was first employed as overseas membership secretary at the Royal Academy of Dance. Attenborough later joined the Arts Council of Great Britain to its national touring programme in 1979 before moving to the Rambert Dance Company as dance liaison officer, expanding its education programme from schools activities to local community events. \nAt the University of Sussex she immersed herself in the life of the University being helped on her first few days by the School of Social Sciences Sponsorship Scheme through which she established her own social network separate to the Arts based network previously established by her elder brother Michael. Unusually for a first year she had her own car, a Hillman Imp, and helped new friends in the University Sailing Club transport people and dinghies to Weir Wood reservoir. Later in her time at Sussex she gravitated towards the Gardner Arts Centre and the Arts scene but was keen to avoid following in her brother's footsteps where possible. She was a positive, cheerful person, charming, popular and a good story teller. She delighted in telling friends about her wonderful \"Uncle David\" and about how her father had agreed to make A Bridge Too Far as the only way that he could obtain the funding for Gandhi a film that he spent a many years bringing to realisation.\nShe married Michael Holland, a Shipbroker in 1982 in Richmond. She had three children Samuel born 9th June 1984, Alice born 26th June 1987 and Lucy born 30th October 1989.\nIn 1985, she became administrator for the National Organisation for Dance and Mime (later Dance UK). Attenborough was later promoted its executive director, expanding the organisation's activities to help companies and choreographers to produce works by ignoring financial means and developed a programme to maintain the fitness of dancers. She worked as arts manager for the Paul Hamlyn Foundation from early 2000, promoting music education in schools in North East England and established links with four London theatres. In her final years Attenborough was manager of the experimental Musical Futures project. \nShe died together with her daughter Lucy and mother in law in the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami while holidaying in Thailand on 26th December 2004.\nAfter Attenborough's death, Dance UK established the Jane Attenborough One Dance UK Industry Award in her name and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation awarded the Jane Attenborough Dance in Education Fellowship to assist a retiring dancer transition to community and education work from 2005 to 2009. A drama and music facility at Waterford Kamhlaba in Eswatini and a small studio at the University of Sussex were named after her.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lady Eleanor Holles School", "response": ["* Jane Attenborough, arts administrator and Boxing Day Tsunami victim"]}, {"page": "Michael Attenborough", "response": ["Attenborough was born on 13 February 1950 in London, the only son of actress Sheila Sim and actor-director Richard Attenborough.
