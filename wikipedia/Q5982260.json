He became a first team regular at the start of the 1996\u201397 season, and his impressive performances earned him a call up to the Scotland under-21s. Later in the season, he was given trials at Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United, but a move failed to materialise. He finished the season with six goals as the club were relegated to the Second Division. In October 1997, Teale was involved a car crash, later admitting that he was \"lucky to be alive\".
