Exiting the Craner Curves, Schwantz is right behind Rainey and lunges up his inside, surprising him and snatching second away from him at the Old Hairpin. This gives Gardner some breathing room, but not for long as Schwantz now starts closing up on him. At the start of Starkey's Straight, the Australian looks behind to see how far behind Schwantz is. Exiting The Esses, the group has to deal with two backmarkers - Schmassmann and Peter Graves. Schmassmann can't get out of the way in time, blocking Gardner in the middle of the Melbourne Hairpin but passing Graves without any problems. As Lawson slows down for the hairpin, Garriga grabs his chance and dives down his inside, passing him for fourth as a result. Schwantz gets blocked by Graves at Goddards, costing him vital time to leader Gardner and allowing Rainey to catch up.", "|  Peter Graves", "| Peter Graves Racing Team"]}, {"page": "Peter Graves (motorcycle racer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Graves (motorcyclist)"]}]}}
