He coxed the men's four, men's lightweight eight and women's eight at the 1994 Commonwealth Regatta representing Scotland. After going up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge University at the end of 1994, he was winning coxswain in the record-breaking CUWBC crew at the 1995 Women's Boat Race, having trialled unsuccessfully for the men's squad. This was quickly followed by coxing Trinity Hall BC to the headship in the May Bumps. In 1996, returning to trial for the men's Boat Race squad for a third time, Potts was finally selected for Goldie, which beat Isis by 11 lengths in a then record time. That year, he also won the Ladies' Challenge Plate at Henley Royal Regatta with CUBC (rowing as Goldie Boat Club). In 1998 he steered the record-breaking Cambridge Blue Boat in the Boat Race.\nPotts won a silver medal at the 1999 World Championships at St. Catharines, Canada in the coxed four with Jonny Searle, Jonny Singfield, Rick Dunn and Graham Smith. Gold came in 2000 at Zagreb in the same boat class with Dunn, Smith and Toby Garbett and Steve Williams. This was the first time Great Britain had won the coxed four at the World Rowing Championships since its inception. That same crew also won the Prince Philip Challenge Cup at Henley.\nPotts' rowing career finished in 2000 coinciding with the completion of his doctoral thesis on \"The Development of the Playhouse in Seventeenth-Century London\". Potts is now a writer and broadcaster, and had a brief acting part in the Australian soap opera Neighbours in 2004. He and his wife Emily are directors of Party Ark, an internet-based children's party supplies business and administer the Titulus Regius website on the history of Richard III. Since 2013 he has been a director of New York-based solar finance company Open Energy Group.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trinity Hall, Cambridge", "response": ["* Alistair Potts \u2013 British World Champion coxswain"]}, {"page": "Steve Williams (rower)", "response": ["* 2000 \u2013 Gold, Coxed Four (with Alistair Potts, Rick Dunn, Toby Garbett and Graham Smith)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Alistair Potts (Trinity Hall), world champion cox"]}, {"page": "List of Old Wykehamists", "response": ["*  Alistair Potts, world champion coxMaclure and Stevens, 2014. p. 743"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh University Boat Club", "response": ["*Alistair Potts, GB Coxswain, 2000 World Champion and Boat Race winner"]}]}}
