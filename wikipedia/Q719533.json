He began performing professionally during childhood, eventually earning acclaim in the UK jazz scene as an adult. Feldman emigrated to the United States in the mid-1950s, where he continued working in jazz and also as a session musician with a variety of pop and rock performers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Miles Davis", "response": ["In December 1962, Davis, Kelly, Chambers, Cobb, and Rollins played together for the last time as the first three wanted to leave and play as a trio. Rollins left them soon after, leaving Davis to pay over $25,000 (US$ in  dollars) to cancel upcoming gigs and quickly assemble a new group. Following auditions, he found his new band in tenor saxophonist George Coleman, bassist Ron Carter, pianist Victor Feldman, and drummer Frank Butler. By May 1963, Feldman and Butler were replaced by 23-year-old pianist Herbie Hancock and 17-year-old drummer Tony Williams who made Davis \"excited all over again\". With this group, Davis completed the rest of what became Seven Steps to Heaven (1963) and recorded the live albums Miles Davis in Europe (1964), My Funny Valentine (1965), and Four & More (1966). The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Davis's previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed."]}, {"page": "Vince Guaraldi", "response": ["| Nonet; with Conte Candoli (trumpet), Milton Bernhart (trombone), Herb Ellis (guitar), Monty Budwig, Peter Marshall (bass), Jack Sperling, Jerry Granelli (drums), Victor Feldman (percussion); music and dialogue version (no longer in print); nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score", "| Nonet; with Conte Candoli (trumpet), Milton Bernhart (trombone), Herb Ellis (guitar), Monty Budwig, Peter Marshall (bass), Jack Sperling, Jerry Granelli (drums), Victor Feldman (percussion); complete soundtrack; limited released of 1,000 copies", "* 1959 Latinsville!
