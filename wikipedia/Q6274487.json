The series was published in parts, some of which seem to have been issued as early as 1754; but Worlidge died before the work was completed. It was finished by his pupils William Grimaldi and George Powle, and, printed on satin, was published by his widow in 1768 at the price of eighteen guineas a copy.In its original form the volume bore the title, A select Collection of Drawings from curious antique Gems, most of them in the possession of the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom, etched after the manner of Rembrandt by T. Worlidge, printed by Dryden Leach for M. Worlidge, Great Queen Street, Lincolns Inn Fields; and M. Wicksteed, Seal-engraver at Bath, MD.CCLXVIII. The frontispiece, dated 1754, shows Worlidge drawing the Pomfret bust of Cicero; behind on an easel is a portrait of his second wife, Mary. No letterpress was included originally in the volume, but between 1768 and 1780 a few copies were issued with letterpress. After 1780 a new edition, but bearing the original date of 1768, appeared with letterpress in two volumes at five guineas each. The title-page omits mention of \u2018M. Wicksteed's\u2019 name, but is otherwise a replica of the first. Some of the old copper plates (108 in all) were reproduced in \u2018Antique Gems, etched by T. Worlidge on Copper Plates, in the Possession of Sheffield Grace, Esq.,\u2019 London, 1823, (privately printed). Charles William King in his Antique Gems (1872, i. 469) thought Worlidge's plates often inferior to those of Jonathan Spilsbury, and that the descriptions placed below contained some blunders."]}, {"page": "Maria Spilsbury", "response": ["Spilsbury was born at 68 Great Ormond Street, London, in 1776. She had a twin brother but he died at their birth. Her parents were Rebecca and Jonathan Spilsbury.
