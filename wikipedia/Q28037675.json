He was known in his time for political writing, and (flatteringly) as \"the Whig Johnson\", though his reputation has lasted less well than Samuel Johnson's, and the resemblances were at a superficial level; Parr was no prose stylist, even if he was an influential literary figure..  A prolific correspondent, he kept up with many of his pupils, and involved himself widely in intellectual and political life.", "Parr was born at Harrow on the Hill to Samuel Parr, a surgeon, and his wife Ann. Samuel was a determined and educated man who taught his only son Latin grammar at the age of four. At Easter 1752              Parr was sent to Harrow School as a free scholar, and when he left in the spring 1761, he began to assist his father in his medical practice.  His father tried to direct Samuel towards a medical career. Stubbornly, Parr repeatedly turned down offers to extend his medical knowledge. In early November 1762, Parr's mother died. Less than a year later, his father married again, this time to Margaret Coxe, much to the displeasure of his son, who was sixteen at the time.", "thumb|right|Samuel Parr by George DaweNational Portrait Gallery, London", "In Parr 1813 he wrote the Latin inscription on King Richard's Well at the site of the Battle of Bosworth, Shenton.The works of Samuel Parr: with memoirs of his life and writings ed.
