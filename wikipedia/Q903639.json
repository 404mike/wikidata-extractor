The song was recorded in 2011 at the Abbey Road Studios. According to Welch, \"No Light, No Light\" was the first song written for the album. During an interview with MTV News she confirmed the release of the song. Welch further revealed that the intro of the song was written during the tour in Amsterdam, \"We had gone out for Rob [Ackroyd]'s birthday to an all-night restaurant in Brussels called Midnights. We went to this funny restaurant and then got on the tour bus and everyone was a bit drunk and it was like, 'Yeah, let's write a song.'\" Welch also said that \"No Light, No Light\" was also recorded in Amsterdam, \"And we recorded the sound of the bus moving, a real drone-y bass sound, and that's the intro, and then the tour bus arrived in Amsterdam [and we were saying], 'Let's go toast this song! We will find a bar that will serve us drinks at 7 in the morning! Come!'.[...] So we trotted off into Amsterdam and managed to find a sports bar that would only serve us Midori. It was bright-green drinks and me and Isa [Summers] kind of looking like crazy old ladies.\" During an interview with Los Angeles Times, Welch further described the song as \"one of the biggest tracks on the album.\" Island Records released the song as the third single from Ceremonials on 16 January with two remixes by Dave Sitek and Breakage. Consequence of Sound's Chris Coplan gave a mixed review for the remix by Dave Sitek, saying: \"In the able hands of Sitek, 'No Light, No Light' loses some of its melodramatic air, replaced instead with an effervescent, club-ready vibe.
