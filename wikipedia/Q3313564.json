Four of the tracks on The Xmas Demos would appear on Puppy, while the remaining tracks, \"Liquid\" and the original \"Another Kind of Blues\", did not make the final cut. The release of Puppy was significantly delayed by a change to the band's record label, switching from Virgin Records offshoot Circa to One Little Indian. Speculation about a new album was furthered when, in 2003, the remaining members of Fluke released two singles forming the basis of this next album. Though the aptly titled \"Slap It: The Return\" signaled a break from the past, with the writing credits listed simply as \"Bryant/Fugler\" under the Appalooso label, \"Pulse\" exemplified a much darker style and was released on the One Little Indian label. In 2003, Fluke finally released their fifth studio album and first without Mike Tournier, Puppy, six years after their previous effort Risotto.
