The magazine soon obtained a large readership, with the management being taken over by Damodar K. Mavalankar, a Theosophist who introduced the idea of referring to the Masters as mahatmas. In December, Blavatsky and Olcott travelled to Allahabad, there visiting Alfred Percy Sinnett, the editor of The Pioneer and keen Spiritualist. A.O. Hume was also a guest at the Sinnett's home, and Blavatsky was encouraged to manifest paranormal phenomena in their presence. From there, they travelled to Benares, where they stayed at the palace of the Maharaja of Vizianagram. Blavatsky and Olcott were then invited to Ceylon by Buddhist monks. There they officially converted to Buddhism\u2014apparently the first from the United States to do soLori Pierce, \"Origins of Buddhism in North America\", in Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America, Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon (eds.).

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, scholars increasingly saw the term \"esotericism\" as meaning something distinct from Christianity\u2014as a subculture at odds with the Christian mainstream from at least the time of the Renaissance. The French occultist and ceremonial magician Eliphas L\u00e9vi (1810\u20131875) popularized the term in the 1850s, and Theosophist Alfred Percy Sinnett (1840\u20131921) introduced it into the English language in his book Esoteric Buddhism (1883). L\u00e9vi also introduced the term l'occultisme, a notion that he developed against the background of contemporary  socialist and  Catholic discourses. \"Esotericism\" and \"occultism\" were often employed as synonyms until later scholars distinguished the concepts."]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 26 June \u2013 Alfred Percy Sinnett, theosophist (born 1840)"]}, {"page": "Ascended master", "response": ["The first mention of Maitreya in a Theosophical context occurs in the 1883 work Esoteric Buddhism by Alfred Percy Sinnett (1840\u20131921), an early Theosophical writer. The concepts described by Sinnett were amended, elaborated on, and greatly expanded in The Secret Doctrine, a book originally published 1888. The work was the magnum opus of Helena Blavatsky, one of the physical founders of the Theosophical Society and of contemporary Theosophy. In it, the messianic Maitreya is linked to both Buddhist and Hindu religious traditions. In the same work Blavatsky was to assert that there have been, and will be, multiple messianic (or messianic-like) instances in human history. These successive appearances of \"emissarie of Truth\" are according to the Blavatsky writings part of the unceasing oversight of Earth and of its inhabitants by a physically hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, called Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. The Theosophist, Alice Bailey, who broke with the Indian branch of the Theosophical Society, and who was heavily influenced by orthodox Christianity, started the expectation that the \"\"Maitreya\" would actually be reborn on the earth  as a physical being, fulfilling the Christian ideal of a Second Coming, rather than the New Age ideal of the Christ being reborn in the heart of each individual."]}, {"page": "Theosophical Society in America", "response": ["By way of comparison, the modern Theosophical Society in America bases its studies on Helena Blavatsky, but draws from a broad group of other Theosophical teachers, including Annie Besant, Alfred Percy Sinnett, Charles Webster Leadbeater, Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa, Ernest Wood, Clara Codd, Geoffrey Hodson, Nilakanta Sri Ram, Joy Mills, Radha Burnier, Stephan A.
