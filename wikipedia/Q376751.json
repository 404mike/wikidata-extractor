The accident occurred shortly after the release of his book.In January 2018 he announced his intended-return as a TT rider, but had not sufficiently recovered to compete and in April announced a setback had prevented any competitive riding. He was able to complete a  Parade lap of the TT circuit on a Norton SG4 during the June 2018 event, but returned in August to win the 2018 Classic TT on the 500 cc Paton.In May/June 2019 McGuinness made a return to the TT races, riding a large capacity Norton without success, but again renewed his association with smaller-capacity Hondas finishing in places 15 and 17 for the two Supersport 600 races, second place in the TT Zero electric race, and another win in August's Classic TT, part of the Manx Grand Prix race weeks.In 2013, a left-hand bend on the Snaefell Mountain Course used for TT races before the top of Barregarrow on the main A3 road was named McGuinness's in recognition of his wins, together with Dave Molyneux who was similarly honoured.He was part of a multi-rider motorcycle endurance-racing team called Honda TT Legends.
