He served for many years as Professor of Political Science at the London School of Economics, and was also known for his popular publications. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he was Professor of Political Theory at the European University Institute in Florence (Italy).\nHe was born at 53 Harringay Road, Harringay and educated at South Harringay School, the University of London and the St Catherine's College, Oxford. As a young man, Cranston was a friend of the painter Denton Welch, and was immortalised as \"Markham\" in Welch's short story, \"Touchett's Party\". During the Second World War, Cranston was a conscientious objector, active in the Peace Pledge Union, and a \"frequent contributor\" to its newspaper Peace News.Cranston's major works include biographies of John Locke, for which he received the 1957 James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and Rousseau, Jean-Paul Sartre and others addressing the history of liberty.\nHe contributed to many publications in both Britain and the United States and wrote scripts for the BBC. In 1946 two of his detective novels were published by John Westhouse: Tomorrow We'll Be Sober and Philosopher's Hemlock. Under the name Michael Stone, he also wrote a children's school story The Master of Magic, published by Peter Lunn in 1947.Cranston's intellectual interests were varied. His first academic book, Freedom: A New Analysis (1954), covered history (the history of liberalism), politics (a precursive discussion of what Sir Isaiah Berlin would later analyse as negative and positive liberty) and a philosophical attempt to resolve or at least elucidate freedom of the will. The philosophical section was the least successful; and Cranston never again attempted pure philosophy. His main academic strengths were as a biographer and as an intellectual historian. In a controversial paper, Cranston argued that the scarcity of welfare goods and services meant that supposed welfare rights are not really rights at all.In his later years, Cranston moved to the political right, and expressed admiration for Margaret Thatcher. Cranston also contributed to The American Spectator magazine.\nCranston had a keen aesthetic sensibility. This was shown not only in his clothes but also in his elegant literary style. Elegance extended also to his conversation. At a party for politics students at the London School of Economics in 1965, sherry was much in demand. Professor Kingsley Smellie pointed to a bottle and said to Cranston: \"I hope you've ordered buckets of that stuff\". \"I have\", Cranston replied without malice, \"not quite in those terms\".\nMaurice Cranston was married twice; his first wife was the film editor Helga May his second wife was Baroness Maximiliana von und zu Fraunberg (\"Iliana\"), with whom he had two children. He died on 5 November 1993 of a heart attack while taping a television production in London for the BBC. He was 73. He had completed work on the third and final volume of his acclaimed Rousseau biography, which was published posthumously in 1997.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau", "response": ["*  'The Social Contract, trans.

Fictional content aside, the point of origin of virtually all of his stories is biographical: they are often set in places he knew or had visited, and feature thinly-disguised, often deeply unflattering, depictions of friends, family and acquaintances (to the extent that over thirty years after Welch's death, his art school friend, the artist Gerald Leet, refused to contribute to Michael De-la-Noy's biography, where he is identified only as 'Gerald' in the index.De-la-Noy, Michael (25 June 1998), Obituary: Gerald Leet, \"The Independent\"James Methuen-Campbell stated that before his death in 1998, Gerald Leet (who sometimes used his middle name \u2014Mackenzie\u2014as a surname) was more co-operative for his own biography of Welch, published in 2002.). Welch chose to depict himself a few times in fictionalised form, most notably as \"Orvil Pym\" in In Youth is Pleasure, and as \"Mary\" in \"The Fire in the Wood\". \"Robert\" was also one of his favourite personas. The philosopher Maurice Cranston, who had known him since his teens (and who featured in at least one story) observed that Welch was as unforgiving in depictions of himself as he was of others.Cranston, Maurice (1951) \"Denton Welch\" in The Spectator, 1 June 1951, reprinted in Spectator Harvest (1952), ed. Wilson Harris, London: Hamish Hamilton, p.74", "Many commentators who wrote about Denton Welch after his death had their views clouded by largely non-aesthetic concerns: by their perception of his sexuality,Phillips (1974) p. 147 or of his treatment of them personally in his writing, or of the \"hateful winsomeness\"Bailey, Paul (1984) \"Sensitive Plant\", The Observer, 25 November of his personality.

Simply labelling him ...'a homosexual' is to use a bright, pat word which will make foolish people think they have learned the secret of something they have not begun to understand.Cranston, Maurice (1963) \"The Courage of Naivet\u00e9\" in The Listener, May 30"]}, {"page": "A Critique of Pure Tolerance", "response": ["In 1970, the philosopher Maurice Cranston called A Critique of Pure Tolerance Marcuse's most popular and disturbing work to date. Cranston commented that it was published, \"in a peculiar format, bound in black like a prayer book or missal and perhaps designed to compete with The Thoughts of Chairman Mao as devotional reading at student sit-ins.\" The philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre argued that Marcuse's theory of the right of revolutionary minorities to suppress opinions is both false and could potentially become \"an effective barrier to any rational progress and liberation\". He accused Marcuse of having \"taken over from liberal and right-wing critics of the European revolutionary tradition a theory which they falsely ascribed to the left, but which was rarely held until Marcuse espoused it.\" Against Marcuse, he argued that the proper end of tolerance is not truth but rationality, and that Marcuse's proposals undermined the possibility of rationality and critical discussion. He stated that Marcuse's case against tolerance made those radicals who espouse it \"allies of the very forces which they claim to attack.\" The political scientist Ronald Bayer identified Marcuse's arguments about \"repressive tolerance\" as an influence on gay rights activists, who disrupted lectures by psychiatrists and refused to tolerate the views of their opponents as they campaigned for homosexuality to be declassified as a mental disorder."]}, {"page": "Tom-Gallon Trust Award", "response": ["* Maurice Cranston for \"A Visit to the Author\""]}, {"page": "Roger Woolhouse", "response": ["Cambridge University Press requested Woolhouse write a biography of Locke, the last major biography being Maurice Cranston's 1957 work.
