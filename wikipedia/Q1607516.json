As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York records that, in addition to these two productions of Patience, Carte was simultaneously managing many other projects. These included two companies touring with Patience, two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J.

Moncure Daniel Conway followed in 1883, then George Augustus Sala whom had earlier written to Smythe after hearing how much money Forbes had cleared during his tour. Smythe informed Sala that he would have to hear him first and Sala responded by telling Smythe to \"...go to the lower levels of Tartarus!.\" A local consortium then engaged Sala, brought him to Australia and upon finding him difficult to manage, asked Smythe to take him off their hands.

John Boyle O'Reilly and the Rev. D. E. Hudson, editor of the Ave Maria, urged her into magazine work. Her first three stories appeared almost simultaneously, \"The Knickerbocker Ghost\" and \"The Tsar's Horses\" in the Catholic World and \"Back from the Frozen Pole\" in Harper's Magazine. \"The Tsar's Horses\" traveled round the world, its last reproduction being in New Zealand. It was attributed at first, because of its accuracy of detail, to Archibald Forbes, the war correspondent. Dorsey's specialty was boys' stories. Midshipman Bob went through two editions in the United States and England in its first year, and was since translated into Italian. Scarcely second to it in popularity was Saxty's Angel and The Two Tramps, while two poems printed in the Cosmopolitan were received with marked favor. For many years, she served as special correspondent for Washington, Chicago, Boston, and Cincinnati papers.
