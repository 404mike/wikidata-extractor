Gell taught at the London School of Economics, among other places. He was also a Fellow of the British Academy.

Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.Robert Layton. (1981) The Anthropology of Art. Thus, there is no consensus on a single, cross-cultural definition of 'art' in anthropology.Howard Morphy & Morgan Perkins. (2006) Introduction, in The Anthropology of Art: A Reader.G. Angioni, Fare dire sentire: l'identico e il diverso nelle culture, Nuoro, il Maestrale, 2011 To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' Primitive Art, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss' The Way of the Masks (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally-specific 'aesthetics'. More recently, in his book Art and Agency, Alfred Gell proposed a new definition of 'art' as a complex system of intentionality, where artists produce art objects to effect changes in the world, including (but not restricted to) changes in the aesthetic perceptions of art audiences.Alfred Gell. (1998) Art and Agency. Gell's ideas have stirred a large controversy in the anthropology of art in the 2000s.Ross Bowden. (2004) A Critique of Alfred Gell on Art and Agency.

It concentrates on the cultivation practices the Trobriand Islanders used to grow yams, taro, bananas and palms which Malinowski's more famous ethnography Argonauts of the Western Pacific briefly mentioned in passing. It describes the gardens in which the Trobrianders grew food as more than merely utilitarian spaces, even as works of art. In 1988 Alfred Gell called the book \"still the best account of any primitive technological-cum-magical system, and unlikely ever to be superseded in this respect\". The book has been described as Malinowski's magnum opus."]}]}}
