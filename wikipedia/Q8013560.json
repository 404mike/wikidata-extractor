He was in the lobby of the House of Commons on 11 May 1812, when Spencer Perceval was shot, and was the first to seize the assassin.  By 1812, he had become editor of The Sun, a semi-official Tory paper started by John Heriot in 1792; he was still there in 1815 and occasionally inserted literary articles, then quite an unusual proceeding; but a quarrel with the chief proprietor brought that engagement to a close in 1817.  He passed next to the editor's chair of the Literary Gazette, which he conducted with success for thirty-four years.\nJerdan's position as editor brought him into contact with many distinguished writers.  An account of his friends, among whom Canning was a special intimate, is to be found in his Men I have Known (1866); the men featured in the book include William Buckland, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Edward Forbes, F.R.S. (with a colorful, eyewitness account of one of Forbes' early oceanographic dredging operations) and William Wordsworth. When Jerdan retired in 1850 from the editorship of the Literary Gazette, his pecuniary affairs were far from satisfactory.  A testimonial of over \u00a3900 was subscribed by his friends; and in 1853 a government pension of 100 guineas was conferred on him by Lord Aberdeen. He published his Autobiography in 4 volumes from 1852\u20131853.\nHis grave in Bushey has a memorial sculpted by Joseph Durham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1869 in literature", "response": ["*July 11 \u2013 William Jerdan, Scottish-born editor (born 1782)"]}, {"page": "1782 in literature", "response": ["*April 16 \u2013 William Jerdan, Scottish journalist (died 1869)"]}, {"page": "Letitia Elizabeth Landon", "response": ["An agricultural depression meant that the Landon family moved back to London in 1815. There John Landon made the acquaintance of William Jerdan, editor of The Literary Gazette. According to Mrs A. T. Thomson, Jerdan took notice of the young Letitia Landon when he saw her coming down the street, \"trundling a hoop with one hand, and holding in the other a book of poems, of which she was catching a glimpse between the agitating course of her evolutions\".Thomson (1860), 145. Jerdan later described her ideas as \"original and extraordinary\". He encouraged Landon's poetic endeavours, and her first poem was published under the single initial \"L\" in the Gazette in 1820, when Landon was 18. The following year, with financial support from her grandmother, Landon published a book of poetry, The Fate of Adelaide, under her full name. The book met with little critical notice, but sold well; Landon, however, received no profits, since the publisher shortly went out of business.Thomson (1860), 151. The same month that The Fate of Adelaide appeared, Landon published two poems under the initials \"L.E.L.\" in the Gazette; these poems, and the initials under which they were published, attracted much discussion and speculation. As contemporary critic Laman Blanchard put it, the initials L.E.L. \"speedily became a signature of magical interest and curiosity\".Quoted in Byron (2004).

The editor of the Literary Gazette, William Jerdan, had previously attempted to procure a living for him, but this had proved unsuccessful, the reason (according to Croly's obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine)  being a confusion between him and another clergyman, a former Roman Catholic, with a similar name. In 1835, however,  through the influence of  Lord Brougham, a distant relative of his wife he was appointed rector of St Stephen Walbrook in the City of London, a position he held until his death. He had previously turned down Brougham's offer of a remote living on the edge of Dartmoor. His son Frederick  wrote:This parish being very small, and most of the parishioners non-resident, the new rector could still devote a large portion of his time to general literature. A still greater advantage of his new position was, that it afforded an opportunity of exercising in a metropolitan church those remarkable powers as a preacher, which had been comparatively thrown away upon a rural congregation. The church of St Stephen's, previously almost deserted, soon became filled, under the influence of this powerful attraction, with a large and attentive congregation, most of whom came from a considerable distance.In 1847 he was appointed afternoon preacher to the Foundling Hospital, but soon resigned after criticism from its governors, who felt that his style was unsuitable for a congregation consisting mainly of children and servants. In his letter of resignation, Croly wrote \"Christianity is a manly religion, addressed to manly understandings, and which ought to be preached in a manly language.\"White p.335 He usually preached extemporare.
