The present school is still named Downe House School, and one of its houses is still named Darwin. The novelist Elizabeth Bowen, who was a pupil at the school during the First World War, wrote after revisiting Down House in the 1930s: \"I have never liked scientific people very much, and it mortifies me to think of them trampling reverently around there on visiting days, thinking of Charles Darwin and ignorant of my own youth.\"Bowen 1950, p. 194."]}, {"page": "Anne Ridler", "response": ["Anne Bradby was educated at Downe House School and later published a biography of her headmistress, Olive Willis.
