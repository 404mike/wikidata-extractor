In the 1950s and 1960s, Embleton also pursued a career as an oil painter, and he exhibited his works widely in Britain, Germany, Australia, Canada and the USA. He was a member of the London Sketch Club and the National Society of Painters, Sculptors and Printmakers, and in 1960 was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. \nFollowing Embleton's death at age 57, his obituary in The Times described him as \"responsible for some of the finest full-colour adventure series in modern British comics ... a grandmaster of his art.\" David Ashford and Norman Wright, writing in Book and Magazine Collector (March 2002), note that \"his work for such diverse periodicals as Express Weekly, TV Century 21, Princess, Boys' World, and Look and Learn have earned him the respect of every practitioner in the field and the gratitude of all of us who admire the art of the comic strip.\"His younger brother is fellow illustrator and comics artist Gerry Embleton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons", "response": ["The closing titles were originally intended to feature images of printed circuit boards and other electronic components to reflect the Andersons' initial conception of Scarlet as a \"mechanical man\".

In earlier episodes, the paintings are accompanied by the instrumental version of the Captain Scarlet theme music; in later episodes, this was substituted by a lyrical version sung by The Spectrum. The paintings were created by comic artist Ron Embleton, who would later illustrate the adult comic strips Oh, Wicked Wanda! and Sweet Chastity for Penthouse magazine.Bentley 2001, p.\u00a0102.Bentley 2017, p.\u00a0115.

Elements of the new series, including Captain Black, had been introduced as early as June 1967.

After the TV series finished its original run, the comic continued the story of Spectrum and the Mysterons, with subsequent adventures showing that the Mysterons deactivate their city on Mars and relinquish their control over Black while Scarlet leaves Spectrum to fight Earth-bound threats. The Mysterons eventually reawaken, prompting Scarlet and Spectrum to resume their struggle. Captain Scarlet was also featured in TV21 and Century 21 annuals for 1967, 1968 and 1969.
