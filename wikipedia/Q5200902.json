He scored 6,132 runs at 26.20, with two centuries, against Somerset (130) and Hampshire (115).  He took 181 catches, and 173 wickets at 30.75 with his right arm medium pace, with a best of 7 for 54 against Gloucestershire.  He took five wickets in an innings on four occasions.  He won his Yorkshire cap in 1935.  He was part of the team which dominated the County Championship in the 1930s.\nSir Leonard Hutton remembered Turner as a 'kind mentor and companion' in his formative years with Yorkshire in the 1930s, and a young Fred Trueman was a beneficiary of Turner's perception at a coaching session at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. Recognising Trueman's talent, Turner thrust the young Maltby Colliery haulage worker into the county spotlight.Turner died in November 1968, in Wath-on-Dearne, Yorkshire.  His brother, Francis Turner, played five matches for Yorkshire and his son, Brian Turner, also played twice for them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["At Maltby Secondary School, Trueman had two teachers called Dickie Harrison and Tommy Stubbs who recognised his talent as a bowler and picked him for the school team, even though he was much younger than the other players. His school playing career was interrupted for two years after he was seriously injured by a cricket ball that hit him in the groin. He started playing again in 1945 when he was fourteen but left school that summer to start work, initially in a newsagent. He had several jobs before becoming a professional cricketer.Arlott, p. 18. Inhibited by his injury, Trueman might have given up on cricket at this time but instead, motivated by his family, he joined a nearby village club called Roche Abbey, playing regularly for them in 1946. He was successful at Roche Abbey and, before the 1947 season when he was sixteen, came to the notice of former Yorkshire player Cyril Turner who was coaching the Sheffield United Cricket Club which played at Bramall Lane, a ground then in regular use by Yorkshire for first-class cricket.Arlott, p. 19.As It Was, p. 32.", "In his autobiography, Trueman acknowledged his debt to Cyril Turner, \"a superb coach\", who taught him how to \"hold the ball properly\", enable it to swing both ways and how to follow through properly to complete his bowling action.As It Was, p. 34. Trueman played some matches for Sheffield United's Second XI team in the 1947 season and was then promoted to the first team so that he could play in the Yorkshire Council League.As It Was, p. 35. The following winter, he received an invitation from Yorkshire to attend indoor coaching classes at Headingley, Leeds, under the supervision of Bill Bowes and Arthur Mitchell."]}, {"page": "Bill Bowes", "response": ["Yorkshire at this time was in a period of transition. They had won the championship four times between 1922 and 1925 but had since then been overshadowed by their great rivals Lancashire who had won the title in each of the preceding three seasons. In 1929, Yorkshire and Lancashire tied on points as runners-up, the title going to Nottinghamshire. Yorkshire's team relied on the experience and leadership of the veterans Rhodes and Robinson and on the expertise of established professionals like Sutcliffe, his opening partner Percy Holmes, Leyland and bowler George Macaulay. Otherwise, the team consisted of up and coming players who were effectively on trial and there was competition for places. Bowes, for example, had Frank Dennis as his main rival for the role of pace bowler. Other aspiring players active in 1929 were Wilf Barber, Horace Fisher, Arthur Wood and Cyril Turner while Arthur Mitchell had gained his county cap the previous year. Waiting in the wings, however, was Hedley Verity who was then playing in the Lancashire League and made his Yorkshire debut in 1930."]}, {"page": "1939 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire were captained by Brian Sellers, whose efforts earned him a place in Wisdens \"Five Cricketers of the Year\".  The team had five batsmen who all scored more than 1000 championship runs: Len Hutton (2167), Wilf Barber (1388), Herbert Sutcliffe (1230), Maurice Leyland (1191) and Arthur Mitchell (1087).  The bowling depended on Hedley Verity (165 wickets), Ellis Robinson (102), Bill Bowes (96) and Frank Smailes (49).  The wicket-keeper was Arthur Wood who completed 39 catches and 27 stumpings.  Other players included Cyril Turner and future England captain Norman Yardley."]}, {"page": "Brian Turner (cricketer)", "response": ["His father, Cyril Turner, and uncle, Francis Turner, were also professional cricketers, who both played in the first-class game for Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "Francis Turner (cricketer, born 1894)", "response": ["Born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, England, Turner was a right-handed batsman and right arm medium pace bowler, who scored 33 runs with a highest score of 12, for an average of 4.71. He also took two catches. Turner played for Scotland in 1935.  His brother, Cyril Turner, and nephew, Brian Turner, also played first-class cricket for Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1919\u20131927)", "response": ["Following the retirement of Geoffrey Wilson after the 1924 season, Yorkshire appointed yet another amateur as captain, this time Major Arthur Lupton who held the post from 1925 through 1927.  Otherwise the team was unchanged apart from representative calls and Yorkshire generally sent out Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Kilner, Rhodes, Robinson, Lupton, Macaulay, Dolphin and Waddington in 1925.  Arthur Mitchell was still a reserve and Cyril Turner made his first-class debut."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1933\u20131939)", "response": ["Sutcliffe's first-class aggregate for the 1934 season was 2,023 runs at 49.34 with 4 centuries and a highest score of 203 against Surrey at The Oval.  Yorkshire had a comparatively poor season by their recent standards and finished 6th in the County Championship behind Lancashire.  The team was never really settled and the loss of Holmes resulted in a number of opening partnerships being tried.  Sutcliffe generally opened with Mitchell but Barber also opened and so, in 14 matches, did a rising star from Pudsey called Len Hutton, who was 18 in June 1934.  Sutcliffe and Hutton opened for Yorkshire in one championship match in 1934 which was the game against Essex at The Circle, Kingston upon Hull, in July.  They shared 14 in the first innings but then Hutton was out and Sutcliffe went on to make 166.  In the second innings, Hutton opened with Mitchell and was out without scoring.  Sutcliffe did not bat and Yorkshire won comfortably by 123 runs.  Yorkshire had too many players missing several matches each: the team played 30 championship games but none of Bowes, Leyland, Macaulay, Sutcliffe or Verity managed to appear in 20.  Cyril Turner and Frank Smailes became first-team regulars."]}, {"page": "Cyril Turner (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cyril Turner"]}]}}
