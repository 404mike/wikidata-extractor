He scored 6,132 runs at 26.20, with two centuries, against Somerset (130) and Hampshire (115).  He took 181 catches, and 173 wickets at 30.75 with his right arm medium pace, with a best of 7 for 54 against Gloucestershire.  He took five wickets in an innings on four occasions.  He won his Yorkshire cap in 1935.  He was part of the team which dominated the County Championship in the 1930s.\nSir Leonard Hutton remembered Turner as a 'kind mentor and companion' in his formative years with Yorkshire in the 1930s, and a young Fred Trueman was a beneficiary of Turner's perception at a coaching session at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. Recognising Trueman's talent, Turner thrust the young Maltby Colliery haulage worker into the county spotlight.Turner died in November 1968, in Wath-on-Dearne, Yorkshire.  His brother, Francis Turner, played five matches for Yorkshire and his son, Brian Turner, also played twice for them.", "link_mentions": {}}}
