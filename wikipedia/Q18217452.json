He designed the St Peter\u2019s Hospital in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden (1880\u201384), the Hospital for Women in Euston Road (renamed the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital after the death of its founder), Chelsea Public Library (1890), and the School of Medicine for Women in Handel Street (1896). He also designed the Old Vestry Hall at the rear of the Chelsea Town Hall on King's Road, as well as the Government Offices Great George Street, which today house the Treasury, HM Revenues and Customs and part of the Cabinet Office.From 1871 he employed Agnes Garrett and Rhoda Garrett as apprentices, giving them an entry into training that no other practice was willing to allow, as architecture was not considered suitable for women. The two cousins became the first British women to open an interior design business.Brydon was the author of the entry on William Eden Nesfield in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.", "link_mentions": {}}}
