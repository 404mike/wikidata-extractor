Backgrounds of the African vistas in the \"Dawn of Man\" sequence were combined with soundstage photography via the then-new front projection technique.

The expansive backdrops for the African scenes required a screen  tall and  wide, far larger than had been used before. When the reflective material was applied to the backdrop in  strips, variations at the seams of the strips led to visual artefacts; to solve this, the crew tore the material into smaller chunks and applied them in a random \"camouflage\" pattern on the backdrop. The existing projectors using  transparencies resulted in grainy images when projected that large, so the crew worked with MGM's special-effects supervisor Tom Howard to build a custom projector using  transparencies, which required the largest water-cooled arc lamp available. The technique was used widely in the film industry thereafter until it was replaced by blue/green screen systems in the 1990s."]}, {"page": "Special effects supervisor", "response": ["*Tom Howard"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["|Tom Howard", "|Tom Howard"]}, {"page": "Professor Popper's Problem", "response": ["Filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, Professor Popper's Problem was serialised into six 14 to 16 minute episodes for television viewing. Akin to other CFF features of the 1970s, the film broke with the Foundation's earlier releases by accurately representing aspects of working-class Britain, albeit through a science fiction narrative. Though restricted by a small budget, props and special effects defined the film; in this respect, O'Hara praised Tom Howard for his work on the picture. Reviews have been few and mixed from its release on 1 January 1975. Upon immediate showings, the film was characterised as unpretentious entertainment. Conversely, the picture has since been appraised as a low-point in Drake's career, simply by his agreeing to act in something perceived as so small. These criticisms have nevertheless been matched by retrospective assessments approving of the film's realistic depictions of 1970s Britain, in addition to Drake's subsequent theatrical roles.", "The screenplay was written by Leo Maguire, based on an original story by Richard Loncraine. Maguire previously worked with producer Simpson on CFF film Kadoyng (1972), \"demonstrating the Foundation's preference for familiar faces\".Shail 2016, p. 77. Ian Millsted of Infinity magazine notes that CFF screenplays of the 1970s\u2014including Professor Popper's Problem\u2014remedied critiques of its features of the 1950s and 60s, which suggested \"that they seemed to be set on an alien world where all the children spoke the Queen\u2019s English [...], behaved with impeccable morals and were routinely smarter than any adult\". According to Millsted, this was achieved by deploying \"noticeably more regional accents and working class characters\", relegating science-fiction elements to jovial plot points rather than intrinsic storylines. Notwithstanding, \"gadgets and gimmicks became the order of the day\".Millsted 2017, p. 65. In this Professor Popper's Problem was typical, using special effects by Tom Howard and deliberately oversized props on a \"very small budget\" of \u00a3250,000. O'Hara remarked that many props were borrowed since \"nobody minded really as it was a CFF film\", also praising Howard, \"who was really talented at making the money go a long way\".
