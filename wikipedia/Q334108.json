Bessant to General Synod of the Church of England, February 2006, Church apologises for slave trade bbc.co.uk news, 8 February 2006. The same claim was repeated in the House of Commons by Chris Bryant, MP for Rhondda:The claim stated that \"The Bishop of Exeter kept 655 slaves until the time of Abolition of Slavery Act 1833 and he received \u00a312,700 in compensation, Hansard, 6 March 2006, column 600: 21. However, it has been shown that the Compensation of \u00a313089.4s.4d was paid to Phillpotts and three others acting as trustees and executors for John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley for 665 slaves on three plantations in Jamaica. It is not likely that any share of such funds, equivalent to more than one million pounds sterling in present value, went to Phillpotts as he would not have been permitted to be paid for acting as Executor nor to benefit under the terms of the Will.", "Both the office of the then Bishop of Exeter, Michael Langrish, at the time of the allegation, and the Devon County Library (which holds Diocesan records), have stated that they hold no record of any further involvement in the slave trade by Phillpotts other than the recording as a Trustee/Executor of a joint holding of the 665 slaves that were the property of John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley,"]}]}}
