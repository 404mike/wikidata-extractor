Devine was prepared to gamble on this play because he saw in it a powerful articulation of a new post-war spirit. Osborne was living on a houseboat on Cubitts Yacht Basin in Chiswick on the River Thames at the time with Creighton, eating stewed nettles from the riverbank. So keen was Devine to contact Osborne that he rowed out to the boat to tell him he would like to make the play the fourth production to enter repertory. The play was directed by Tony Richardson and starred Kenneth Haigh, Mary Ure and Alan Bates. George Fearon, a part-time press officer at the theatre, invented the phrase \"angry young man\". He told Osborne that he disliked the play and feared it would be impossible to market.", "In 1993, a year before his death, Osborne wrote that the opening night was \"an occasion I only partly remember, but certainly with more accuracy than those who subsequently claimed to have been present and, if they are to be believed, would have filled the theatre several times over\".

Had we honoured every one of those requests, this theatre would not have been able to survive\" Milton Shulman in the Evening Standard, for example, called the play \"a failure\" and \"a self-pitying snivel\".

Harold Hobson of The Sunday Times called Osborne \"a writer of outstanding promise\". During production the married Osborne began a relationship with Mary Ure, and would divorce his wife, Pamela Lane, to marry Ure in 1957.", "The play became an enormous commercial success, transferring to the West End and Broadway, and touring to Moscow.

The play turned Osborne from a struggling playwright into a wealthy and famous angry young man and won him the Evening Standard Drama Award as the most promising playwright of 1956.", "This was in the summer of 1955 and Osborne spent much of the next two years before their divorce hoping they would reconcile. In 1956, after Look Back in Anger had opened, Osborne met her at the railway station in York, at which meeting she told Osborne of her recent abortion and enquired after his relationship with Mary Ure, of which she was aware.
