He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He went to school at Silcoates School, Wakefield but later moved to Batley Grammar School.\nThe former-Yorkshire fast bowler made headlines for a spell of bowling against Uganda of 4 for 7, identical to fellow bowler Tim Bresnan.\nIn 2004 Stiff decided to leave Yorkshire amid a lot of interest from other counties. He apparently had interest from a dozen counties and took the opportunity to play for Kent. He toured Australia with the Under-17s in 2001, and with the Under-19s in 2003, also playing in the Under-19s World Cup in Bangladesh.\nIn 2007, Stiff was released by Kent and went to Leicestershire. At the start of the 2009 season Stiff joined Somerset on a two-month trial and on 14 May 2009 he accepted an extension to his contract which would last until the end of that season.  In August 2010, Somerset's Director of Cricket, Brian Rose announced that Stiff's contract would not be renewed for the 2011 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kent County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["|David Stiff ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm fast ||"]}, {"page": "Batley Grammar School", "response": ["*David Stiff, professional cricketer"]}, {"page": "Silcoates School", "response": ["* David Stiff (born 1984), County Cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* David Stiff (2009\u20132010) 12 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of Star Wars cast members", "response": ["| David Stiff"]}, {"page": "Weston-super-Mare Cricket Club", "response": ["*David Stiff - Formerly of Somerset, Yorkshire, Leicestershire and Kent"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2009", "response": ["Somerset promoted four players from their academy for the 2009 season, giving contracts to Jos Buttler, Adam Dibble, Chris Jones and James Burke. Of these, only Buttler appeared in the first-team during the season.

Caddick\u2014who made his first-class debut for Somerset in 1991\u2014only played five matches in 2009, and announced his intention to retire at the end of the season. He took ten wickets in 2009, and finished his career as Somerset's sixth highest wicket-taker of all-time. This placed the majority of the wicket-taking burden upon Charl Willoughby, the South African fast-medium pace bowler. He responded well, and took 54 wickets in the County Championship, more than any other bowler in the first division. He was aided by seam bowlers David Stiff, who returned to the first-class game for the first time since 2006, and Alfonso Thomas. Stiff took 31 wickets, more than quadrupling his career first-class wicket total, and Thomas took 35, his highest return in an English domestic season. Somerset lacked an effective spin bowler in 2009 following the departure of Ian Blackwell the previous season, and the spinners combined only claimed 31 wickets, bowling less balls between them than Willoughby alone."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2010", "response": ["| David Stiff ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm fast || "]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2011", "response": ["Somerset started the season as many people's favourites for the County Championship title, and many praised the signings of Gemaal Hussain, Steve Kirby, Ajantha Mendis and George Dockrell.
