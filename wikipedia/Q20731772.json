Voter registration took place between 30 December and 19 January 1963, in which 1,871,170 people registered for the general roll and 814 for the special roll. With so few people registering for the special role, Minister for Transport and Communications Colin Cameron campaigned for the abolition of the special roll, writing to every European resident in the country. The final decision of the Secretary of State was to reduce the number of special roll seats to three. Another brief period of registration was allowed between 24 and 29 February for Europeans who had missed out on registering for the special roll. However, the 620 people that registered in this period were added to the general roll. This gave a total of 1,871,790 people registered on the general roll."]}, {"page": "1964 Malawi cabinet crisis", "response": ["Before the elections, the Colonial Office had assumed that MPC would be entitled to three Executive Council seats through winning a majority of the \"lower roll\" seats. As the Lancaster House agreement provided that two Executive Council seats would go to ministers elected by the \"upper roll\" of largely European and Asian electors, it was thought that the mainly white United Federal Party would gain both these seats: with five officials also sitting, there would be a non-MCP majority on the Executive Council. In the event, the United Federal Party only won five Legislative Council seats, two going to MPC and one to an MCP-inclined independent, Colin Cameron. The Governor offered the United Federal Party a single Executive Council seat, which it refused. This left all five elected seats for MCP candidates. In theory, Jones, the Governor, was entitled to allocate portfolios, but he allowed Banda to make nominations. Banda decided to take two for himself, becoming both Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Local Government. Chiume became Minister of Education and Augustine Bwanausi became Minister of Labour. The two upper roll ministers were Colin Cameron (Minister of Works) and Mikeka Mkandawire as Minister without Portfolio. Two MCP parliamentary secretaries were also appointed, but did not sit in the Executive Council. These were Dunduzu Chisiza in the Ministry of Finance and Orton Chirwa in the Ministry of Justice. Two additional appointments were made in March 1962, of John Msonthi and Willie Chokani, and Chirwa became the Minister of Justice and Attorney-general at the start of 1964.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 381\u20132.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 45.", "Colin Cameron, the only European minister remaining at independence on 6 July 1964, stated that, at that time, all the African ministers apart from Chiume had decided to press for rapid Africanization and links with other African states, and to end Banda's dictatorial behaviour. On his return from a visit to Cairo on 26 July, Banda made a public speech threatening ministers; this had the perverse effect of uniting them all, including Chiume. Banda's proposal to reintroduce detention without trial at the cabinet meeting of 29 July 1964 united all the ministers against him, but only Colin Cameron resigned. Chipembere later explained that the other ministers did not resign as detention was a popular issue they could not oppose, but they hoped it would be used sparingly.C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 72. On 10 August, the ministers attending (Tembo was not present, and Chiume was probably also absent) asked Banda to stop making slighting references to them in speeches and not to hold so many government portfolios himself. Chipembere later recorded that Banda gave them a hearing, but was concerned that they were \"ganging up\" against him, and was reluctant to meet them as a group. However, Banda appeared to accept their concerns and apologised about the hurtful remarks he had made about them.C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 72\u20133."]}]}}
