He was educated at Cambridge and Oxford in economics and anthropology, and was formerly a consultant for NGOs and development agencies, and a journalist.\nKeen is a theorist of contemporary conflict, notably in African society. He has done fieldwork in Sudan, Sierra Leone and Iraq, and archival research.In Endless War and in several articles he has argued that \"winning war is rarely an end in itself; rather, war tends to be part of a wider political and economic game that is consistent with strengthening the enemy\". The \"war on terror\" is, for Keen, an extension of the Cold War.\nThe Benefits of Famine explored how the 1980s famines in Sudan were of use to certain groups.  Famines have powerful beneficiaries including political elites and traders. International intervention \"may offer significant political and bureaucratic benefits for international donors\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Structural functionalism", "response": ["* David Keen"]}, {"page": "Democratic peace theory", "response": ["This criticism is confirmed by David Keen who finds that almost all historical attempts to impose democracy by violent means have failed."]}, {"page": "Crisis States Research Centre", "response": ["The Centre ran through two phases, the first from 2000-2005, led by Prof. James Putzel.

Keen elaborates on the economic incentives for warfare and argues that there is more to war than simply \"winning.\" In some instances, it could be more beneficial for certain parties to prolong war, so long as they are in control of economic resources or power positions. This can become common in states with weak rule of law where violence becomes privatized. Elite groups within weak states attempt to harness economic agendas and resources within a given civil society and are motivated to create private profit by mobilizing violent means. Keen continues by citing various possible economic functions of violence.", "David Keen, a professor at the Development Studies Institute at the London School of Economics, has several innovative and new ideas regarding the ideas of war.T. Allen. \"Complex emergencies and humanitarian responses.\" University of London: International Issues (2012): 2-17. His work is considered by many to be one of the leading arguments against greed vs. grievance theory. His ideas look into the specifics of complex emergencies, which is a term officially defined by the InterAgency Standing Committee (IASC) as:\"A multifaceted humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is a total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires a multi-sectoral, international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing UN country program. Such emergencies have, in particular, a devastating effect on children and women and call for a complex range of responses.\"United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (2008). OCHA Glossary of Humanitarian Terms 2008.In his book, Complex Emergencies, Keen discusses how a conflict can never be simply a greed scenario. His definition of a \"complex emergency\" demonstrates this broader term and all of its various implications. He goes into several different conflict scenarios, such as 'war', 'famine', and 'information', and then sets up an argument against the idea of greed. He believes that although a conflict, whether it be the 'War on Terror' or the conflict in Sierra Leone, may be centered around some concept of greed or grievance, this can never solely explain a conflict. Although seemingly obvious, Keen looks to demonstrate that, \"the aims in a war are complex\".David Keen. \"Complex Emergencies: David Keen Responds\" African Arguments: Royal African Society. He does not believe that greed and grievance can be examined separately, but rather that they are partner terms that must be implemented in a complementary way. For example, when Keen discusses the conflict in Sudan, he says, \" the grievances of northern pastoralists were useful for a government trying to get its hands on oil in areas that famine and militia attacks helped to depopulate; meanwhile, the 'greed' of the Arab militias themselves (for labour, cattle and land) was itself intimately linked to their grievances\". He makes it clear that it is necessary to first spend ample time defining the type of conflict at hand because the differences between genocide and a civil war are substantial, so it is necessary to diagnose the incentives and solutions for the conflict with a mix of multiple theories."]}, {"page": "Keen, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Keen"]}]}}
