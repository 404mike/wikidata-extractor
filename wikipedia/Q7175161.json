He founded Clongowes Wood College and was also rector of the Jesuits in Ireland. A gifted administrator, Kenney made two trips to the United States, where he established Maryland as a vice-province and set up Missouri as a separate Jesuit mission.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clongowes Wood College", "response": ["* Peter Kenney (1814\u20131817) \u2013 founder of the college", "* Peter Kenney (1821\u20131830)https://www.clongowes.net/about-clongowes/history/#1474976222117-46b97115-d48f"]}, {"page": "Anthony Kohlmann", "response": ["Upon his arrival in Maryland in 1815, Kohlmann was made the master of novices at the novitiate in White Marsh. Shortly after that, Giovanni Antonio Grassi left Maryland for Rome, and Kohlmann succeeded him as the superior of the Jesuits' Maryland Mission on September 10, 1817. As superior, Kohlmann advocated selling the Jesuits' plantations in rural Maryland to finance the establishment of other colleges in the major American cities. The Anglo-American Jesuits fiercely opposed this proposal. Disagreements between the Continental European Jesuits in the United States and the Anglo-American ones became so entrenched that the Jesuit Superior General sent the Irish Jesuit Peter Kenney as an ecclesiastical visitor. He also assumed Kohlmann's role of mission superior on April 23, 1819."]}, {"page": "Thomas Betagh", "response": ["In Dublin he worked with Fathers Austin, James Mulcaile SJ, and Fullham in the old chapel at Rosemary Lane, and taught at the school in Saul's Court. With them, he also assisted the secular clergy for years. In 1773 the Jesuits was suppressed by pope Clement XIV, so Betagh had to seek incardination into a diocese. (The Order was restored only six months after his death.) He served as a curate, and succeeded the Rev. Field as parish priest of SS. Michael and John's on Exchange Street. The parish was located in one of the poorest areas of Dublin. Betagh established free schools in Schoolhouse Lane, off Cook Street, then in Skinner's Row, and finally in Smock Alley, catering for about 330 boys. Amongst his pupils were the future Archbishop of Dublin Daniel Murray, and the founder of Clongowes Wood Fr. Peter Kenney SJ who reestablished the Jesuits in Ireland, whose studies he sponsored."]}, {"page": "Giovanni Antonio Grassi", "response": ["In July 1817, Archbishop Neale sent Grassi to Rome to persuade the Congregation de Propaganda Fide to reverse a previous order to reinstate several priests in Charleston, South Carolina, whom Neale had removed from ministry. Grassi would remain in Europe for the rest of his life, despite the calls of Peter Kenney, the visitor to the United States on behalf of the Superior General, to return Grassi to Georgetown."]}, {"page": "Stephen Larigaudelle Dubuisson", "response": ["Dubuisson's assignment to rural Maryland did not last long, as by the following year, he again returned to Georgetown as the prefect of studies. He also taught French there, and became the de facto confessor of the nuns of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery and of the students at their school, the Georgetown Visitation Academy. With the arrival of Peter Kenney as visitor to the Maryland mission in 1830, Roothaan appointed Dubuisson as one of Kenney's four consultors. As the Jesuits debated whether to sell their farms in Maryland, which would significantly change the character of the order in the United States, Dubuisson argued against such a decision, believing landownership afforded them security in the event of economic disaster.", "Over time, Dubuisson became a close confidant of Kenney, and the visitor eventually sent Dubuisson to Philadelphia in 1831, where he was to organize the return of the Jesuits to Old St. Joseph's Church. In August of that year, Dubuisson was transferred back to Georgetown, once again becoming the pastor of Holy Trinity Church, where he replaced John Van Lommel. There, he revived the parochial school's Sodality of Our Lady. The parochial school had long suffered from sporadic funding, which forced it to intermittently close. Dubuisson secured a grant from Congress and raised additional funds, which put the school on stable financial footing. In 1831, Dubuisson also was made  to the superior of the Jesuits' Maryland mission, and continued as  to Peter Kenney, when he took over leadership of the mission as visitor."]}, {"page": "Thomas F. Mulledy", "response": ["Mulledy was appointed president of Georgetown College on September 14, 1829, following John William Beschter's brief leadership of the school. Several months before, Peter Kenney had been appointed apostolic visitor to the Jesuit mission in Maryland, and oversaw Mulledy, who was viewed cautiously by the Jesuit superiors in Europe for his ardent republicanism; at the same time, Mulledy was made a consultor to Kenney. When he assumed the presidency, the state of Georgetown was poor; the number of students had dropped to only 45. By 1834, this had rebounded to 140. During his presidency, the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum was more fully implemented, primarily under the direction of the prefect of studies, George Fenwick. In May 1830, the first observation in the United States of the Month of Mary was undertaken by Georgetown's chapter of the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin, which had been founded in 1808 as the first chapter of the sodality in the United States. With a growth in the number of books owned by the university under Mulledy's presidency, he undertook to organize the 12,000 volumes in a single library room in Old North on February 16, 1831."]}, {"page": "James A. Ryder", "response": ["James Ryder was born on October 8, 1800, in Dublin, in the Kingdom of Ireland. He emigrated to the United States as a young boy with his mother, who was widowed by James' father, a Protestant who died when he was a child. She took up residence in Georgetown, then a city in the newly formed District of Columbia. Ryder enrolled at Georgetown College on August 29, 1813, and entered the Society of Jesus in 1815 as a novice, at the age of fifteen. He began his novitiate in White Marsh, Maryland, before being sent to Rome in the summer of 1820 by Peter Kenney, the apostolic visitor to the Jesuit's Maryland mission.", "Founded on January 17, 1830, it was the first collegiate debating society in the United States, and it was Ryder who selected the name. He was also appointed by Peter Kenney as minister and admonitor to Mulledy. In this role, he received a severe lecture from Kenney in 1832 for not properly welcoming six Belgian Jesuits who arrived at the college. In 1834, Ryder became a professor of rhetoric at the university."]}, {"page": "William McSherry", "response": ["Eventually, McSherry left Livorno for the United States on a treacherous voyage that lasted 171 days, and caused some in the United States to fear that the three Jesuits aboard had perished. He arrived at Georgetown on December 22, 1828. The following year, he became a professor of humanities at Georgetown, and was named the minister for the school, procurator, and consultor one year later. He also served as a professor of theology during this time, and as head of the lower classes. From October 1831 to June 1832, he was appointed the socius (assistant) to Peter Kenney, who was the apostolic visitor to the Jesuits in St. Louis and the Missouri Valley. McSherry was recalled to Rome in 1832, where he professed his solemn vows to the Jesuit order, making him one of the first American Jesuits to complete the traditional Jesuit course of training."]}, {"page": "William Feiner", "response": ["Feiner was sent to the United States in 1822 to assist the American Jesuits in re-establishing their work following the worldwide restoration of the Society of Jesus in 1814. After his move, he anglicized his name to William Feiner. From 1823 to 1826, he was assigned as an assistant to Matthew Lekue at the Conewago Chapel in the town of Conewago, Adams County, Pennsylvania, where there was a large German-speaking population. In addition to his pastoral work, Feiner taught theology in Conewago in 1824. Peter Kenney, the Jesuit visitor to the United States, returned to Europe and appointed Feiner to the position in his stead; by this time Feiner was already in very poor health, suffering from tuberculosis."]}, {"page": "Enoch Fenwick", "response": ["The Jesuit visitor to the United States, Peter Kenney, recommended to Archbishop Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal of Baltimore that Fenwick be appointed president of Georgetown College in the summer of 1820. This recommendation heeded, he was informed that he would be named to the office in August of that year, and his term officially began on September 16, 1820. He assumed the office very reluctantly from Anthony Kohlmann, who quit the presidency to establish the Washington Seminary. Resenting his transfer from the cathedral in Baltimore to Georgetown, Fenwick viewed the college as having \"one foot in the grave of disgrace\" and little prospect for recovery."]}, {"page": "Francis Dzierozynski", "response": ["Dzierozynski played a role in the establishment of St. John's College in Frederick, Maryland, in 1829. He was relieved of his office in November 1830, when Peter Kenney arrived as an apostolic visitor to investigate the possibility of elevating the Maryland mission to the full status of a province. A future provincial superior, James A. Ryder, credited Dzierozynski with saving the Jesuit mission in the United States."]}, {"page": "Kenney (name)", "response": ["*Peter Kenney (1779\u20131841), Irish Jesuit priest"]}, {"page": "Kenney, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Kenney"]}]}}
