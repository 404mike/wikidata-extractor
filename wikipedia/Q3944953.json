Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Instead, after it was issued as a single to satisfy record company demand for a new release, the band adhered to their policy of omitting previously released singles from their albums. The song features numerous modulations that occur mid-verse and between its choruses. Session musician David Mason played a piccolo trumpet solo for its bridge section.", "McCartney was dissatisfied with the initial attempts at the song's instrumental fill, and was inspired to use a piccolo trumpet after seeing trumpeter David Mason play the instrument during a BBC television broadcast of the second Brandenburg Concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach. On 17 January, Mason recorded the instrumental solo used for the final mix. Martin later wrote, \"The result was unique, something which had never been done in rock music before.\" The solo is in a mock-Baroque style for which the piccolo trumpet (a small instrument built about one octave higher than the standard instrument) is particularly suited, having a clean and clear sound which penetrates well through thicker midrange textures. According to Emerick, Mason \"nailed it\" at some point during the recording; McCartney tried to get him to do another take but Martin insisted it was not necessary, sensing Mason's fatigue. He also played over the song's final chorus, replacing the oboe parts from that portion of the track.", "*David Mason \u2013 piccolo trumpet solo"]}, {"page": "A Day in the Life", "response": ["* David Mason, Monty Montgomery, Harold Jackson \u2013 trumpet"]}, {"page": "1 (Beatles album)", "response": ["* David Mason: piccolo trumpet solo on \"Penny Lane\", trumpet on \"All You Need Is Love\""]}, {"page": "All You Need Is Love", "response": ["*David Mason \u2013 trumpet"]}, {"page": "It's All Too Much", "response": ["* David Mason and three uncredited session players \u2013 trumpets"]}, {"page": "Magical Mystery Tour (song)", "response": ["On 3 May, a brass fanfare and other trumpet parts were added in a disorganised session where the four trumpet players, including David Mason and Elgar Howarth, began the evening without a score.
