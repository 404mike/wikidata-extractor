The Electric Telegraph Company used the system to acquire stock prices and other financial information to pass to subscribers of their service over their telegraph wires. The advantage of the pneumatic system was that without it the company would have had to employ runners to carry messages between the two buildings, or else employ trained telegraph operators within the Stock Exchange. In the mid-1860s, the company installed similar systems to local stock exchanges in Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester.Kieve, Jeffrey L., The Electric Telegraph: A Social and Economic History, p. 82, David and Charles, 1973 .  After the telegraphs were nationalised in Britain, the pneumatic system continued to be expanded under Post Office Telegraphs. This expansion was due to the invention in 1870 by Joseph William Willmot (previously employed at the Electric & International Telegraph Company) of improving Latimer-Clark's invention with the 'double sluice pneumatic valve' and in 1880 the 'intermediate signaller/quick break switch for pneumatic tubes' which dramatically speeded up the process which made it possible for multiple carrier messages in the tube at any one time.  By 1880 there were over 21 miles of tube in London.Kieve, p. 235  A tube was laid between the Aberdeen fish market office and the head post office to facilitate the rapid sale of a very perishable commodity.Kieve, p. 237"]}, {"page": "British Science Association", "response": ["The undertaking was suggested to the BA by William Thomson, and its success was due to the use of Thomson's mirror galvanometer. Josiah Latimer Clark and Fleeming Jenkin made preparations. Thomson, with his students, found that impure copper, contaminated with arsenic, introduced significant extra resistance.

They were strong advocates of establishing a unified system of electrical units, and a number of the proposals they made in a paper presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1861 were later taken up by the British Association Committee on Electrical Standards and formed the foundations of the system of ohms, amps, and volts still in use today. In 1865 he was awarded a Telford Medal for a paper on the possibilities of submarine cable telegraphy from England to China and Australia."]}, {"page": "Clark cell", "response": ["The Clark cell, invented by English engineer Josiah Latimer Clark in 1873, is a wet-chemical cell (colloquially: battery) that produces a highly stable voltage. In 1893, the output of the Clark cell at 15 \u00b0C was defined by the International Electrical Congress as 1.434 volts, and this definition became law in the United States in 1894. This definition was later supplanted by one based on the Weston cell."]}, {"page": "Latimer Clark", "response": ["#redirectJosiah Latimer Clark"]}, {"page": "Francis Ronalds", "response": ["Ronalds had a very modest and retiring nature and did little to publicise his work through his life. During his last years, however, his key accomplishments became well known and revered in the scientific community, aided in particular by his friends Josiah Latimer Clark and Edward Sabine and his brother-in-law Samuel Carter.  He was knighted at the age of 82.  Colleagues at the Society of Telegraph Engineers regarded him as \"the father of electric telegraphy\", while his continuously recording camera was noted to be \"of extreme importance to meteorologists and physicists, and\u2026 employed in all first-rate observatories\". His portrait was painted by Hugh Carter. Commemorative plaques have been installed on two of his former homes and a road was named after him in Highbury. Ronalds Point in Antarctica is named after Francis Ronalds."]}, {"page": "Edwin Clark (civil engineer)", "response": ["Clark was at one time a mathematical master at Brook Green, then became a Surveyor in the west of England. In 1846 Clark went to London where he met Robert Stephenson, who appointed him Superintending engineer of the Menai Bridge. Clark, in turn, appointed his brother Josiah Latimer Clark as his Assistant Engineer.

The telegraph lines became overloaded and the operating companies had to resort to sending messages by carriage between the two major telegraph stations on the Rue de Grenelle and the Place de la Bourse, with messages sometimes delayed by road traffic.  As early as 1853 a pneumatic tube message system was installed by Josiah Latimer Clark to link the London Stock Exchange with the offices of the Electric Telegraph Company.  Tests of a pneumatic message-carrying system were made by Ambroise Ador in Paris' Parc Monceau in 1852 and further tests were made by  in 1854."]}]}}
