It remained in ruins until 1880, when a three-year restoration project was undertaken. Nothing further was done until 1928, when Major-General Sir Ivor Philipps acquired the castle and began an extensive restoration of the castle's walls, gatehouses, and towers. After his death, a trust was set up for the castle, jointly managed by the Philipps family and Pembroke town council."]}, {"page": "Gwilym Lloyd George", "response": ["Educated at Eastbourne College and Jesus College, Cambridge, Lloyd George was commissioned into the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1914.  In 1915 he became Aide-de-Camp to Major-General Ivor Philipps, commander of the 38th (Welsh) Division. He transferred to the Anti-Aircraft branch of the Royal Garrison Artillery in 1916 and rose to the rank of Major, being known for most of his political career as Major Lloyd George. He was also mentioned in despatches."]}, {"page": "38th (Welsh) Infantry Division", "response": ["On 19 September 1914, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George stated publicly that he \"should like to see a Welsh Army in the field\". This thought quickly picked up support from politicians and from Kitchener; a Welsh Army Corps of two divisions totalling 50,000 men was approved on 10 October. The recruits were to be drawn from Wales as well as Monmouthshire and from Welshmen living in Liverpool, London and Manchester. The creation of the corps soon became a source of dispute between Lloyd George and Kitchener and was never realised due to a lack of potential recruits. Llewelyn Wyn Griffith, an officer within the 38th (Welsh) Division, commented that \"the population of Wales was not sufficient to raise two full divisions and all the corps units required\". By the end of 1914, it had been decided that only one division would be raised. The 10,000 men, who had since joined the Welsh Army Corps, were formed into the 43rd Division of Kitchener's Fifth New Army. The division comprised the 113th, 114th and 115th Brigades, and was made up of battalions from the Royal Welsh Fusiliers (RWF), the South Wales Borderers (SWB) and the Welsh Regiment (Welsh). On 19 January 1915, Major-General Ivor Philipps was assigned as the first divisional commander. By March, 20,000 men had been enlisted and over the coming months the first units reached full strength. Despite steady recruitment, by 30 June 1915, 20 per cent of recruits had been removed, having been discharged primarily for medical reasons or transferred to other units leaving 27,836 men within the ostensible Welsh Army Corps. The division was made up predominately of Welshmen, but it included soldiers from the rest of the United Kingdom and several other nations.", "When Horne found out that the 14th RWF had not moved and that their attack had been pushed back to 8 July, he summoned Ivor Philipps to Corps Headquarters and sacked him. General Douglas Haig, commander of the BEF, noted this event in his diary. He wrote: \"visited HQ XV Corps and saw General Horne. He was very disappointed with the work of the\u00a0... 38th Welsh Div\". Haig further commented that Philipps was relieved of his command as the majority of the division had \"never entered\" the woods despite the \"most adequate\u00a0... bombard[ment]\", had suffered \"under 150 casualties\" during their attack and that: \"a few bold men [who had] entered the Wood found little opposition\". Historian Don Farr wrote that Haig's entries are at odds with the facts and that he relied heavily on what Horne had told him. Farr states that Horne's account to Haig was self-serving, did no justice \"to the difficulties confronting the troops on the ground\", and did not acknowledge the failure of the bombardment. He also suggests that the sacking of Philipps may have been political, by a distrusting officer corps towards a perceived political appointee."]}, {"page": "Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne", "response": ["The divisions bypassed Mametz Wood, a position the Germans had heavily entrenched and needed to be captured to allow XV to carry on the advance. As the 7th Division had suffered heavy casualties, the 38th (Welsh) Division was assigned to the Corps and ordered to take the wood. Horne interfered in the division's efforts to attack the wood, issuing conflicting orders and going as far as to ordering a single platoon into action. Due to the miscommunication between Horne and the division's commander, Ivor Philipps was fired and replaced by the commander of the 7th Division. Horne wrote a \"self-serving\" account of this event that did no justice to men of the division or the difficulties they had faced. On 9 July the Welsh launched a full-scale attack on the woods and cleared it by the following day. During their 6 days on the Somme, the Welsh division suffered 3,993 casualties. Historian Don Farr wrote that the reputation of the Welsh division suffered due to the repeated interference by Horne in matters best left to the divisional or brigade staff and his \"inexperience of battlefield command at this level\". With the wood cleared, Horne would lead his Corps during the Bazentin Ridge, the Battle of Delville Wood, and the Battle of Flers\u2013Courcelette."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Ivor Philipps"]}, {"page": "Mametz Wood Memorial", "response": ["Infuriated by what he saw as a distinct lack of \"push\" Sir Douglas Haig with Lt-General Henry Rawlinson visited the HQ of the Welsh Division to make their displeasure known.

However, there were calls, led by local MP Sir Ivor Philipps and other public and political figures, for a more substantial memorial.

The vehicle was driven by Thomas Gerard Hetherington into tensioned barbed wire, across dummy shell holes and small piles of railway sleepers. The vehicle demonstrated good mobility but was not able to breakthrough the barbed wire. After a short while, Lt Kenneth Symes fitted the turretless armoured bodywork from a Delaunay-Belleville armoured car onto the vehicle, creating the first tracked armoured vehicle. It was envisioned for this vehicle to join the RNAS Armoured Car Section, but this was not realized due to the unit's imminent disbandment. The vehicle was transferred to the RNAS Barrow Airship Station in September 1915, serving as a tow tractor there. The project itself was also abandoned, as the vehicle was unable to fulfil all-terrain warfare requirements and could not cross wide trenches."]}, {"page": "General Philipps", "response": ["*Ivor Philipps (1861\u20131940), British Indian Army major general"]}]}}
