A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the Duke of Blacas's wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and John Turtle Wood discovered the remains of the 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC Temple of Artemis at Ephesos, another Wonder of the Ancient World.South from Ephesus \u2013 An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33\u201334,(Brian Sewell, 2002, )", "The British Museum has one of the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of antiquities from the Classical world, with over 100,000 objects. These mostly range in date from the beginning of the Greek Bronze Age (about 3200 BC) to the establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, with the Edict of Milan under the reign of the Roman emperor Constantine I in 313 AD. Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were Charles Newton, John Turtle Wood, Robert Murdoch Smith and Charles Fellows."]}, {"page": "Ephesus", "response": ["The history of archaeological research in Ephesus stretches back to 1863, when British architect John Turtle Wood, sponsored by the British Museum, began to search for the Artemision. In 1869 he discovered the pavement of the temple, but since further expected discoveries were not made the excavations stopped in 1874. In 1895 German archaeologist Otto Benndorf, financed by a 10,000 guilder donation made by Austrian Karl Mautner Ritter von Markhof, resumed excavations. In 1898 Benndorf founded the Austrian Archaeological Institute, which plays a leading role in Ephesus today."]}, {"page": "John (given name)", "response": ["*John Turtle Wood (1821\u20131890), British architect, engineer, and archaeologist"]}, {"page": "John Wood", "response": ["* John Turtle Wood (1821\u20131890), British architect, engineer, and archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Charles Thomas Newton", "response": ["Newton's keepership at the museum was marked by an amassing wealth of important acquisitions, which were largely attributable to his personal influence or initiation. Thus in the ten years 1864-74 alone he was enabled to purchase no less than five important collections of classical antiquities: the Farnese, the two great series of Castellani, the Pourtales, and the Blacas collections, representing in special grants upwards of \u00a3100,000. Meanwhile, his work in the Levant, bringing to the museum the direct results of exploration and research, was being continued by his successors and friends: Biliotti in Rhodes, Smith and Porcher at Gyrene, Lang in Cyprus, Dennis in Sicily, in the Cyrenaica, and around Smyrna, Pullan at Priene, John Turtle Wood at Ephesus were all working more or less directly under Newton on behalf of the museum."]}, {"page": "1863 in archaeology", "response": ["* Excavations at Ephesus by John Turtle Wood begin."]}, {"page": "1869 in archaeology", "response": ["* Temple of Artemis at Ephesus discovered by British archaeologist John Turtle Wood near Kusadasi, Turkey."]}, {"page": "1821 in architecture", "response": ["* February 13 \u2013 John Turtle Wood, English architect (died 1890)"]}, {"page": "List of Worthing inhabitants", "response": ["* John Turtle Wood, architect, engineer and archaeologist lived on Marine Parade and is buried in Christ Church in the town centre."]}, {"page": "List of Old Rossallians", "response": ["* John Turtle Wood \u2013 architect, engineer and archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Christ Church, Worthing", "response": ["Architect, engineer and archaeologist John Turtle Wood who lived at Marine Parade in Worthing is buried in Christ Church in the town centre.

These excavations continued until 1874. A few further fragments of sculpture were found during the 1904\u20131906 excavations directed by David George Hogarth. The recovered sculptured fragments of the 4th-century rebuilding and a few from the earlier temple, which had been used in the rubble fill for the rebuilding, were assembled and displayed in the \"Ephesus Room\" of the British Museum.The sculptures were published in the British Museum Catalogue of Sculpture, vol. II, part VI. In addition, the museum has part of possibly the oldest pot-hoard of coins in the world (600 BC) that had been buried in the foundations of the Archaic temple."]}]}}
