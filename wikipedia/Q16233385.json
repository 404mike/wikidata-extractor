He was also on the mountain and shot film for two documentaries. One of these documentaries was shown on TV4 in March 2007 and was called Fredrik Str\u00e4ng och mysteriet p\u00e5 Everest (Fredrik Str\u00e4ng and the Everest mystery) and was about the theory that George Mallory theoretically could have climbed the mountain as early as June 8, 1924. The other documentary was called 7 Summits and was about Fredrik Str\u00e4ng's climb of the tallest mountains on each continent on the planet. Fredrik Str\u00e4ng was even on Mount Everest to look for a Kodak Vest pocket camera which George Mallory's climbing partner Andrew Irvine would have carried and which hypothetically could contain a photograph of Mallory and Irvine on the summit."]}, {"page": "List of IMG Academy alumni", "response": ["* Jamie McGuinness"]}, {"page": "List of USL Pro transfers 2013", "response": ["| February 5, 2013 ||  Jamie McGuinness || VSI Tampa Bay FC (PDL) || VSI Tampa Bay || Free ||"]}, {"page": "List of USL transfers 2015", "response": ["| January 23, 2015 ||  Jamie McGuinness ||  IMG Academy Bradenton ||  Colorado Springs Switchbacks || Free |||"]}, {"page": "List of foreign USL Championship players", "response": ["*Jamie McGuinness \u2013 VSI Tampa Bay, Colorado Springs Switchbacks \u2013 2013, 2015"]}]}}
