Charlton's first Football League match was against Exeter City in August 1921, which they won 1\u20130. In 1923, Charlton became \"giant killers\" in the FA Cup beating top flight sides Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion, and Preston North End before losing to eventual winners Bolton Wanderers in the Quarter-Finals. Later that year, it was proposed that Charlton merge with Catford Southend to create a larger team with bigger support. In the 1923\u201324 season Charlton played in Catford at The Mount stadium and wore the colours of \"The Enders\", light and dark blue vertical stripes. However, the move fell through and the Addicks returned to the Charlton area in 1924, returning to the traditional red and white colours in the process.", "| Walter Rayner|| June 1920\u00a0\u2013 May 1925 ||"]}, {"page": "Rayner", "response": ["*Walter Rayner, British football manager"]}]}}
