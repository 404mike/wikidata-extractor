He joined the LDS Church in England in 1845. In 1850, Stenhouse married Fanny Warn and shortly thereafter joined Lorenzo Snow and Joseph Toronto on a mission to Italy; they became the first LDS Church missionaries to preach in that country. Later in the same year, Stenhouse was sent to Switzerland and became the first Mormon missionary to preach there.\nIn 1855, Stenhouse and his wife emigrated to Utah Territory. They settled in Salt Lake City; Stenhouse the editor of the Salt Lake Telegraph, a newspaper that was consistently pro-Mormon. Their daughter, Clara Federata Stenhouse, married Joseph Angell Young.  In 1870, Stenhouse was convinced by the writings of William S. Godbe, who criticised LDS Church President Brigham Young on political and religious grounds. The Stenhouses were particularly opposed to the LDS Church's practice of plural marriage. Stenhouse and his wife became part of the \"Godbeites\" and were excommunicated from the LDS Church.\nAs Godbeites, Stenhouse and his wife published several expos\u00e9s of Mormonism. Stenhouse's most famous work is his 1873 The Rocky Mountain Saints: A Full and Complete History of the Mormons. In 1872, Fanny Stenhouse published \"Tell it All\": The Story of a Life Experience in Mormonism.\nStenhouse died in San Francisco, California.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mountain Meadows Massacre", "response": ["Initial published reports of the incident date back at least to October of 1857 in the Los Angeles Star. A notable report on the incident was made in 1859 by Carleton, who had been tasked by the U.S. Army to investigate the incident and bury the still exposed corpses at Mountain Meadows. The first period of intense nationwide publicity about the massacre began around 1872 after investigators obtained Klingensmith's confession. In 1868 C.V. Waite published \"An Authentic History Of Brigham Young\" which described the events. In 1872, Mark Twain commented on the massacre through the lens of contemporary American public opinion in an appendix to his semi-autobiographical travel book Roughing It. In 1873, the massacre was given a full chapter in T. B. H. Stenhouse's Mormon history The Rocky Mountain Saints. The massacre itself also received international attention, with various international and national newspapers also covering John D. Lee's 1874 and 1877 trials as well as his execution in 1877."]}, {"page": "Adam\u2013God doctrine", "response": ["Young and other adherents of the doctrine claim that Smith was its originator; ;  (same); ;  . and that Smith privately taught it to them before his death, in 1844.

Joseph could not reveal what was revealed to him, and if Joseph had it revealed, he was not told to reveal it.\");  (citing Wilford Woodruff Journal of 4 September 1860, in which George Q. Cannon said \"that Adam is our Father [and] is a true doctrine revealed from God to Joseph & Brigham. For this same doctrine is taught in some of the old Jewish records which have never been in print.\");  (citing Wilford Woodruff Journal of 16 December 1867, stating that \"President Young said Adam was Michael the Archangel, & he was the Father of Jesus Christ & was our God & that Joseph taught this principle.\");  (citing an 1877 reminiscence of Anson Call, who said he heard Smith say that \"now regarding Adam: He came here from another planet [as] an immortalized being and brought his wife, Eve, with him, and by eating of the fruits of the earth became subject to death and decay and he became of the earth, earthly, was made mortal and subject to death.\"). However, the prevailing academic view is that the doctrine taught by Young and others was an elaboration of Smith's vague references to Adam's unique role in Mormon doctrine.;  (\"Young's Adam\u2013God teachings were an expansion of Joseph Smith's sermons in 1839-44\");  (stating that there is \"no reliable evidence contemporary to Smith's lifetime which lends support\" to the view that Smith taught the Adam\u2013God doctrine, and that Young \"was not above inventing support for beliefs where none existed previously\"). Although Young is generally credited with originating the doctrine, the original source may also have been Young's counselor in the First Presidency, Heber C. Kimball.

Stenhouse both attributed the doctrine to Kimball)."]}, {"page": "Media coverage of the Mountain Meadows Massacre", "response": ["The first historical work to discuss the massacre in any depth was an 1873 work by T.

Later that same year, a pamphlet containing the Book of Abraham's facsimiles was sent to the Louvre. Here, Theodule Deveria, an Egyptologist at the museum, had the opportunity to examine the facsimiles, which he recognized as \"common Egyptian funerary documents, of which he had examined hundreds.\". He argued that many of the hieroglyphic characters had been poorly transcribed and that several areas in the facsimiles seemed to have been reconstructed based on guesswork. Deveria consequently concluded that Joseph Smith's explanation was \"rambling nonsense.\" Despite this condemnation, the LDS Church did not respond to Deveria's critiques at the time.. Then, in 1873, Deveria's interpretation, juxtaposed with Smith's interpretation, was published in T. B. H. Stenhouse's book The Rocky Mountain Saints: A Full and Complete History of the Mormons, a work critical of the LDS Church. This time, the church responded by reiterating that the Book of Mormon was divinely inspired, and that the Book of Abraham's source papyri had \"two meanings\" (one that was obvious and easily understood by to a lay audience, and another that was more esoteric and only accessible to the priesthood).
