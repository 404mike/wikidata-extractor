Bone was an active member of both the British War Memorials Committee in the First World War and the War Artists' Advisory Committee in the Second World War.

Whitman's writings and those of Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Edward Carpenter were major influences on Holden's life. He incorporated many of their philosophies and principles into his style of living and method of working."]}, {"page": "Stanley Spencer", "response": ["Spencer lived in Cookham until April 1920 when he moved to Bourne End to stay with the trade union lawyer Henry Slesser and his wife. While there, he worked on a series of paintings for their private oratory. In all, during the year he spent at the Slessor's home, Spencer painted some twenty pictures including Christ Carrying the Cross, which is now in the Tate. In 1921 Spencer stayed with Muirhead Bone at Steep in Hampshire where he worked on mural designs for a village hall war memorial scheme which was never completed. In 1923 Spencer spent the summer in Poole, Dorset, with Henry Lamb. While there he worked on sketch designs for another possible war memorial scheme. These designs convinced two early patrons of Spencer's work, Louis and Mary Behrend, to commission a group of paintings as a memorial to Mary's brother, Lieutenant Henry Willoughby Sandham, who had died in the war. The Behrends planned to build a chapel in the village of Burghclere in Berkshire to house the paintings."]}, {"page": "Christopher R. W. Nevinson", "response": ["In April 1917, with the support of Muirhead Bone and his own father, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist by the Department of Information. Wearing the uniform of a war correspondent, he visited the Western Front from 5 July to 4 August 1917, a period which included the start of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July. Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Ch\u00e2teau d'Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an observation balloon above the Somme. Making his way to a forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to his reputation for recklessness.", "While on the trip, he did sketch a line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making their way to the rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the painting The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held."]}, {"page": "1876 in art", "response": ["* March 23 \u2013 Muirhead Bone, Scottish-born etcher (died 1953)"]}, {"page": "War artist", "response": ["* Muirhead Bone, 1888\u20131953."]}, {"page": "1916 in art", "response": ["* May \u2013 Muirhead Bone recruited as a war artist by the British War Propaganda Bureau.

The stylised mules painted at the top of Christie's Pilgrim's Progress mural also bear a notable resemblance to those painted by Spencer in his mural at the Sandham Memorial Chapel and his painting Travoys with Wounded Soldiers Arriving at a Dressing Station at Smol, Macedonia of 1919, held by the Imperial War Museum and it might possibly be argued that this minor feature in the Ilford mural is a passing homage to Spencer."]}, {"page": "William Edwin Rudge", "response": ["* 1925 Adams, Elbridge.
