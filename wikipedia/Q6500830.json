The Housing Act 1969 legislation was introduced to help authorities overcome problems with slum clearances by introducing the concept of General Improvement Areas, where improvement grants were available. It was estimated in 1970 that around 5 million people lived in condemned houses. The criteria to determine the type of house that could be defined as a slum was amended in the 1969 housing act, typically being applied to houses unfit for habitation and those beyond reasonable repair cost. In some cases, a slum clearance area could be declared without swift action, such as in South Kilburn, where 342 unfit houses were identified in 1965 yet only 22 had been demolished by 1970, with local MP Laurence Pavitt commenting that the housing problems was of the most importance to his constituents. In September 1971, the National House Condition Survey estimated that around 1.2 million unfit properties in England and Wales, of which 700,000 (58%) fell within existing or proposed areas for clearance. By the early 1970s, new housing estates were mostly occupied by residents who had been displaced by slum clearance, or those allocates homes who were deemed in greatest need."]}]}}
