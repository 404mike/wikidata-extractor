He produced a wide range of music, but is best known for masterminding the first studio recording of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, begun in 1958.\nGeorg Solti's prolific and award-winning recording career took off when Culshaw was put in charge of Decca's classical recording programme. For Decca, Solti made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. Among the international honours given Solti (and Decca) for his recordings were 31 Grammy awards \u2013 more than any other recording artist, whether classical or popular. For much of that time, Solti's career at Decca was closely linked with Culshaw.Largely self-educated musically, Culshaw worked for Decca from the age of 22, first writing album liner notes and then becoming a producer. After a brief period working for Capitol Records, Culshaw returned to Decca in 1955 and began planning to record the Ring cycle, employing the new stereophonic technique to produce recordings of unprecedented realism and impact. He disliked live recordings from opera houses, and sought to put on disc specially made studio recordings that would bring the operas fully to life in the listener's mind. In addition to his Wagner recordings, he supervised a series of recordings of the works of Benjamin Britten, with the composer as conductor or pianist, and recordings of operas by Verdi, Richard Strauss and others.\nCulshaw left Decca in 1967 and was appointed head of music programmes for BBC Television, where he remained until 1975, employing a series of innovations to bring classical music to the television viewer. He later undertook several academic posts. He remains best remembered for his Decca records; along with Fred Gaisberg and Walter Legge, he was one of the most influential producers of classical recordings. The Times said of him that \"he stood in that great tradition of propagandists from Henry Wood to Leonard Bernstein, who seek to bring their love and knowledge of music to the widest audience.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Britten", "response": ["Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, was signed up by a major British recording company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works.Stuart, Philip. Decca Classical 1929\u20132009, accessed 24 May 2013. Culshaw wrote, \"The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason that it did not seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were just trying to make music.\"Culshaw, John, \"Ben \u2013 A Tribute to Benjamin Britten (1913\u20131976)\", Gramophone, February 1977, p. 21"]}, {"page": "Gabriel Faur\u00e9", "response": ["By the 1940s there were a few more Faur\u00e9 works in the catalogues. A survey by John Culshaw in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by Kathleen Long (including the Nocturne No. 6, Barcarolle No. 2, the Th\u00e8me et Variations, Op. 73, and the Ballade Op. 19 in its orchestral version conducted by Boyd Neel), the Requiem conducted by Ernest Bourmauck, and seven songs sung by Maggie Teyte.Culshaw, John. \"The Return of Faur\u00e9\", The Gramophone, December 1945, p. 15 Faur\u00e9's music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s. The Record Guide, 1955, listed the Piano Quartet No. 1, Piano Quintet No. 2, the String Quartet, both Violin Sonatas, the Cello Sonata No. 2, two new recordings of the Requiem, and the complete song cycles La bonne chanson and La chanson d'\u00c8ve.Sackville-West, pp. 265\u2013268"]}, {"page": "War Requiem", "response": ["The first recording, featuring Vishnevskaya, Fischer-Dieskau and Pears, with the London Symphony Orchestra and The Bach Choir conducted by Britten, was produced by Decca in 1963. Within five months of its release it sold 200,000 copies, an unheard-of number for a piece of contemporary classical music at that time.Carpenter, Humphrey. Benjamin Britten: A Biography. London: Faber and Faber, 1992: p411. Recording producer John Culshaw reports that Vishnevskaya threw a tantrum during the recording, as she believed\u00a0\u2013 not having performed the work before\u00a0\u2013 she was being insulted by being placed with the choir instead of at the front with the male soloists.Culshaw Putting the Record Straight (1981): pp. 312\u201313 The newest (2013) CD reissue of this recording includes 50 minutes of surreptitiously taped rehearsal footage at the time of the recording."]}, {"page": "Decca Records", "response": ["Decca's emergence as a major classical label may be attributed to three concurrent events: the emphasis on technical innovation (first the development of the full frequency range recording [ffrr] technique, then the early use of stereo recording), the introduction of the long-playing record, and the recruitment of John Culshaw to Decca's London office.", "John Culshaw, who joined Decca in 1946 in a junior post, rapidly became a senior producer of classical recordings. He revolutionised recording \u2013 of opera, in particular. Hitherto, the practice had been to put microphones in front of the performers and simply record what they performed. Culshaw was determined to make recordings that would be 'a theatre of the mind', making the listener's experience at home not merely second best to being in the opera house, but a wholly different experience. To that end he got the singers to move about in the studio as they would onstage, used discreet sound effects and different acoustics, and recorded in long continuous takes. His skill, coupled with Decca's sound engineering capabilities, took the label into the first flight of recording companies. His pioneering recording (begun in 1958) of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen conducted by Georg Solti was a huge artistic and commercial success (to the chagrin of other companies). Solti recorded throughout his career for Decca, and made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. Among the international honours given Solti (and Decca) for his recordings were 31 Grammy awards \u2013 more than any other recording artist, whether classical or popular.\"Solti, Georg\", Decca Classics.

He recorded all eight then-existing symphonies by Vaughan Williams for Decca Records in the 1950s with the LPO, in the presence of the composer. The recording producer, John Culshaw, wrote that the composer \"said very little during the sessions because he was totally in favour of Sir Adrian's approach to his music.\"Culshaw, p. 121 Vaughan Williams was to have been present for the first recording of his Ninth symphony, for Everest Records in 1958, but he died the night before the session took place; Boult recorded a short introduction as a memorial tribute. All these recordings have been reissued on CD. In the 1960s Boult re-recorded the nine symphonies for EMI."]}, {"page": "Chicago Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["Sir Georg Solti, former music director and music director laureate, won thirty-one Grammy Awards\u2014more than any other recording artist. He received seven awards in addition to his twenty-four awards with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. In addition, Sir Georg Solti and producer John Culshaw received the first NARAS Trustees\u2019 Award in 1967 for their \"efforts, ingenuity, and artistic contributions\" in connection with the first complete recording of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen with the Vienna Philharmonic. Solti also received the Academy's 1995 Lifetime Achievement Award."]}, {"page": "London Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["In 1971 John Culshaw of BBC television commissioned \"Andr\u00e9 Previn's Music Night\", bringing classical music to a large new audience. Previn would talk informally direct to camera and then turn and conduct the LSO, whose members were dressed in casual sweaters or shirts rather than formal evening clothes. The programme attracted unprecedented viewing figures for classical music;\"Mr John Culshaw\", The Times, 29 April 1980, p. 16 Morrison writes, \"More British people heard the LSO play in Music Night in one week than in sixty-five years of LSO concerts.\"Morrison, p. 180 Several series of the programme were screened between 1971 and 1977.\"Broadcasting,\" The Times, 25 May 1977, p. 31 Previn's popularity with the public enabled him and the LSO to programme works that under other conductors could have been box-office disasters, such as Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony.Camden, Anthony, quoted in Previn, p. 215 In the early 1970s the LSO recorded two firsts for a British orchestra, appearing at the Salzburg Festival, conducted by Previn, Seiji Ozawa and Karl B\u00f6hm, in 1973, and playing at the Hollywood Bowl the following year."]}, {"page": "Erich Kleiber", "response": ["After the Second World War, Kleiber resumed his European activities, first with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1948, and at Covent Garden from 1950 to 1953. The post-war Covent Garden was very different from the star-studded international pre-war seasons. The new company, built from scratch with largely British singers, was not then of international calibre or even approaching it.Haltrecht, p. 145 Kleiber's contribution was of crucial importance to the development of the company.  The record producer John Culshaw wrote:"]}, {"page": "Pierre Monteux", "response": ["The record producer John Culshaw described Monteux as \"that rarest of beings\u00a0\u2013 a conductor who was loved by his orchestras ... to call him a legend would be to understate the case.\"Culshaw, p. 144 Toscanini observed that Monteux had the best baton technique he had ever seen. Like Toscanini, Monteux insisted on the traditional orchestral layout with first and second violins to the conductor's left and right, believing that this gave a better representation of string detail than grouping all the violins together on the left. On fidelity to composers' scores, Monteux's biographer John Canarina ranks him with Klemperer and above even Toscanini, whose reputation for strict adherence to the score was, in Canarina's view, less justified than Monteux's.Canarina, p. 83"]}, {"page": "Georg Solti", "response": ["In addition to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for Decca Records, not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist.Culshaw (1967), p 30 He made his first recording in 1947, playing Brahms's First Violin Sonata with the violinist Georg Kulenkampff. He was insistent that he wanted to conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven's Egmont overture. Twenty years later Solti said, \"I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very good at that time and I was so excited. It is horrible, surely horrible\u00a0\u2013 but by now it has vanished.\"Culshaw (1967), p. 31 He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London, Haydn's Drum Roll symphony, in sessions produced by John Culshaw, with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades.Culshaw (1967), p. 32 Reviewing the record, The Gramophone said, \"The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution.\"\"Haydn Symphony No. 103 in E flat\", The Gramophone, July 1950, p. 16 The Record Guide compared it favourably with EMI's rival recording by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic.Sackville-West, p. 355", "In the recording studios Solti's career took off after 1956, when John Culshaw was put in charge of Decca's classical recording programme. Culshaw believed Solti to be \"the great Wagner conductor of our time\",Culshaw (1967), p. 52 and was determined to record the four operas of Der Ring des Nibelungen with Solti and the finest Wagner singers available.Culshaw (1967), pp. 52\u201353 The cast Culshaw assembled for the cycle included Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, Birgit Nilsson and Wolfgang Windgassen.Culshaw (1967), pp. 273\u2013274 Apart from Arabella in 1957, in which he substituted when Karl B\u00f6hm withdrew, Solti had made no complete recording of an opera until the sessions for Das Rheingold, the first of the Ring tetralogy, in September and October 1958. In their respective memoirs Culshaw and Solti told how Walter Legge of Decca's rival EMI predicted that Das Rheingold would be a commercial disaster (\"'Very nice,' he said, 'Very interesting. But of course you won't sell any.'\")Culshaw (1967), p. 91 The success of the recording took the record industry by surprise. It featured for weeks in the Billboard charts, the sole classical album alongside best sellers by Elvis Presley and Pat Boone, and brought Solti's name to international prominence.Culshaw (1967), p. 124 He appeared with leading orchestras in New York, Vienna and Los Angeles, and at Covent Garden he conducted Der Rosenkavalier and Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream.", "Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\"Patmore, David. \"Sir Georg Solti and the Record Industry\", ARSC Journal 41.2 (Fall 2010), pp. 200\u2013232 ", "Record industry awards to Solti included the Grand Prix Mondial du Disque (14 times) and 31 Grammy Awards (Besides a special Trustees' Grammy Award, shared with John Culshaw, for the recording of the Ring (1967) and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1996)). He won more Grammys than any other recording artist, whether classical or popular. In September 2007, as a tribute on the 10th anniversary of his death, Decca published a recording of his final concert."]}]}}
