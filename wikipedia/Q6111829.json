However, the poem was originally published at the head of a story about the Battle of Jutland and appears to refer to a death at sea; the \"Jack\" referred to may be to the boy VC Jack Cornwell, or perhaps a generic \"Jack Tar\". In the Kipling family, Jack was the name of the family dog, while John Kipling was always John, making the identification of the protagonist of \"My Boy Jack\" with John Kipling somewhat questionable. However, Kipling was indeed emotionally devastated by the death of his son. He is said to have assuaged his grief by reading the novels of Jane Austen aloud to his wife and daughter.\"The Many Lovers of Miss Jane Austen\", BBC2 broadcast, 9\u00a0pm 23 December 2011 During the war, he wrote a booklet The Fringes of the FleetThe Fringes of the Fleet, Macmillan & Co., 1916. containing essays and poems on various nautical subjects of the war.

With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May/June 1940, however, the British Army's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum's artillery pieces return to military service. The museum's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard, while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS Lance (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross-winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell. The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery.
