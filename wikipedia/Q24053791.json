Game started off well, Miedema scoring the first inside 15 minutes. Halfway through the first half, Gabrielle George collided with Mead causing the latter to be stretchered off the field, letting Arsenal fans - all to familiar with injuries over the last seasons - fear the worst. The second half produced the end result: a Little penalty, another Miedema goal and an Everton goal by Chloe Kelly ending the game in 1\u20133. Luckily for the Gunners, Arsenal later reported that after taking x-rays of her leg, Mead's injuries weren't as bad as they seemed during the game - only sustaining bruising to her lower leg."]}]}}
