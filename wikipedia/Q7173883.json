The design is based on the tree of life, an ancient symbol representing the renewal of life. The completed nave is a square space that is enclosed by an outer ambulatory. The ambulatory is low and vaulted. Because the furniture in the nave is not fixed, it can be used for various means, including concerts and exhibitions as well as services. On the rood screen, beneath the nave organ case is a sculpture called Christus by Peter Eugene Ball. The nave organ case was designed by Didier Grassin in 2001; the inside of the panels were designed by Patrick Caulfield. The left side depicts night, with a stylised lighthouse shining on the sea (which alludes to the City of Portsmouth's motto, \"Heaven's Light Our Guide\"). The right door depicts day, showing the sun and the hull of a fishing boat."]}, {"page": "Chelmsford Cathedral", "response": ["In 2000 a sculpture, Christ in Glory by Peter Eugene Ball, was placed above the chancel arch.
