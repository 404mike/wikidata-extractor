Lunt, and others,  was the result of a flopping of consonants by a later Slavic scribe with the original word being  or Syriac and referring to the Aramaic language. Given the likely presence of Aramaic-speaking merchants and Syrian Christian refugees in Crimea, especially the port city of Cherson, at the time, this Syriac hypothesis remains the dominant belief."]}, {"page": "Anglo-Belarusian Society", "response": ["In 1965 the Society began publishing the Journal of Belarusian Studies', with an introduction by Prof. Robert Auty. The Journal was distributed annually to universities, libraries and private subscribers in the UK, the US, the Soviet Union and other countries throughout the world. As well as articles on Belarusian literature, linguistics, history and art, each number of the Journal included book reviews, a chronicle of current events, and a comprehensive bibliography for the preceding year.

Later she would translate songs and poems."]}, {"page": "Arnold McMillin", "response": ["Arnold McMillin studied at the University of London where he earned a PhD in Slavic Philology in 1971. The topic of his dissertation - the vocabulary of the Belarusian literary language in the 19th century - was suggested by a prominent slavist, Robert Auty. Belarus was a completely neglected field of Slavonic studies at that time. In writing the dissertation, McMillin drew upon the resources and expertese of what would become the Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum in London."]}, {"page": "Brian George Hewitt", "response": ["After flirting with the idea of joining the police service in Liverpool, he decided to embark in 1973 on a doctorate, wanting to compare/contrast Ancient Greek with another Indo-European language. The advice of Cambridge\u2019s then-Emeritus Professor of Sanskrit, the distinguished Indo-Europeanist Sir Harold Bailey, whom he consulted was to choose either Lithuanian or Armenian. Initially Hewitt thought that Lithuanian might be the more attractive option. However, as he would need a long-distance adviser for whichever language he selected (Cambridge not having a specialist in either), he contacted Oxford\u2019s Professor of Comparative Slavonic Philology, Robert Auty, for Lithuanian and Oxford\u2019s Professor of Armenian, Charles Dowsett, for Armenian. Prof. Auty proved difficult to reach and by the time his positive response was received, Hewitt had already elected to work on Old Armenian under the general supervision of Alan Sommerstein, but, when the latter moved to Nottingham in 1974, Bernard Comrie took over."]}]}}
