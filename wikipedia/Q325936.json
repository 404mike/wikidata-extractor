Horace Ov\u00e9's Pressure (1975) had been funded by the British Film Institute as was A Private Enterprise (1974), these being the first Black British and Asian British films, respectively. The 1980s however saw a wave of new talent, with films such as Franco Rosso's Babylon (1980), Menelik Shabazz's Burning an Illusion (1981) and Po-Chih Leong's Ping Pong (1986; one of the first films about Britain's Chinese community). Many of these films were assisted by the newly formed Channel 4, which had an official remit to provide for \"minority audiences.\" Commercial success was first achieved with My Beautiful Laundrette (1985). Dealing with racial and gay issues, it was developed from Hanif Kureishi's first film script. My Beautiful Laundrette features Daniel Day-Lewis in a leading role. Day-Lewis and other young British actors who were becoming stars, such as Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tim Roth and Rupert Everett, were dubbed the Brit Pack.Stern, Marlow, and in 1985 we saw the retirement of Roger Moore from the role of Bond after A View to a kill,at the age of 58.\"Gary Oldman Talks 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,' 'Batman' Retirement\".

In such a phenomenon, he continued, \"The surface of daily life (walk, talk, dress, symbolism, heroes, family affairs) is affected with such force that deep and substantive changes in the way large numbers of people think and act take place.\" According to author and film-maker Hanif Kureishi, the Beatles are \"the only mere pop group you could remove from history and suggest that culturally, without them, things would have been significantly different\"."]}, {"page": "2001 in literature", "response": ["*Hanif Kureishi \u2013 Gabriel's Gift"]}, {"page": "1990 in literature", "response": ["*Hanif Kureishi \u2013 The Buddha of Suburbia"]}, {"page": "Roshan Seth", "response": ["|Hanif Kureishi||"]}, {"page": "Shyam Selvadurai", "response": ["In 2004, Selvadurai edited a collection of short stories: Story-Wallah: Short Fiction from South Asian Writers, which includes works by Salman Rushdie, Monica Ali, and Hanif Kureishi, among others.
