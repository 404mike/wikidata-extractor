Shankly made two controversial signings in this period which did not turn out as he had hoped. In 1967, he signed striker Tony Hateley from Chelsea for a club record \u00a396,000 and then felt obliged to transfer him to Coventry City only a year later. He wrote that bad luck and injuries disrupted the progress of two other prospects Alf Arrowsmith and Gordon Wallace; Shankly had compared the latter to Tom Finney.Shankly, p. 110. In September 1968, he paid \u00a3100,000 ()to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their teenage striker Alun Evans who thus became \"football's first \u00a3100,000 teenager\". Evans started well and produced some outstanding performances during his four years at the club but Shankly eventually had to sell him to Aston Villa. He later recalled that Evans was scarred by a glass in a nightclub incident which, in Shankly's opinion, had a detrimental impact on his career.Shankly, pp. 110\u2013111."]}, {"page": "Gordon Wallace", "response": ["Gordon Wallace may refer to:", "* Gordon Wallace (judge) (1900\u20131987), first President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal", "* Gordon Wallace (boxer) (1929\u20132015), Canadian boxer of the 1950s", "* Gordon Wallace (footballer, born 1943), Scottish football player and manager (Dundee, Dundee United, Raith Rovers)", "* Gordon Wallace (footballer, born 1944), Scottish football player (Liverpool)", "* Gordon Wallace (footballer, born 1949), Scottish football player (Raith Rovers, Dundee United)", "* Gordon Wallace (soccer) (born 1955), Scottish-born Canadian international soccer player", "* Gordon Wallace (professor) (born 1958), scientist in the field of electromaterials", "* Gordon Wallace (American football) (1899\u20131931)"]}, {"page": "1964 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|IL ||10|| Gordon Wallace"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["*  Gordon Wallace"]}, {"page": "List of Liverpool F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["Since Liverpool's first competitive match, more than 700 players have made a competitive first-team appearance for the club. Many of these players spent only a short period of their career at Liverpool before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. The First and Second World Wars also disrupted the careers of footballers across the United Kingdom. Keith Burkinshaw only played one match for Liverpool but went on to have a successful managerial career at Tottenham Hotspur, where he won the FA Cup twice. Gordon Wallace, who made 22 appearances for the club, was the scorer of Liverpool's first goal in European competition. He scored the first goal in a 6\u20130 win over KR Reykjavik in the 1964\u201365 European Cup. Roy Evans made 11 appearances during his Liverpool career, and later managed the club from 1994 to 1998.
