He spent five years at the club, also spending time on loan at Leigh RMI, Salisbury City, and Kidderminster Harriers. He moved on to Southend United in 2010, and was initially loaned out to Rushden & Diamonds. He played for Southend in the 2013 Football League Trophy Final and was an unused substitute in the 2015 League Two play-off final victory. He was loaned out to Northampton Town in January 2016, and helped the club to win promotion as League Two champions in 2015\u201316. After being released by Southend, he joined Essex rivals Colchester United for a four-year stay starting in June 2016. He signed for Stevenage in August 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luke (given name)", "response": ["*Luke Prosser (born 1988), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Owen Garvan", "response": ["Garvan was replaced by Luke Prosser as captain by new manager John McGreal in August 2016 ahead of the 2016\u201317 season. Injury impeded his start to the new season. After initially recovering from injury in late August, he suffered a recurrence during training that continued to keep him out of action. He made his first appearance of the season on 22 November, providing an assist for Tom Eastman's goal in Colchester's 3\u20130 win at Cheltenham Town. He scored in his second game of the season on 26 November during Colchester's 4\u20130 home win over Crewe Alexandra."]}, {"page": "John McGreal", "response": ["After Kevin Keen left Colchester following the club's relegation to League Two on 26 April 2016, McGreal was appointed his successor on 4 May. He did not take charge of Colchester until after the final game of the 2015\u201316 season, in which his assistant Steve Ball was named caretaker. The club signed a number of players in preparation for the 2016\u201317 season, including defenders Luke Prosser (who he appointed as captain) and Lewis Kinsella; midfielders Brennan Dickenson, Craig Slater and Doug Loft; and forwards Courtney Senior, Kurtis Guthrie, and Denny Johnstone. However top-scorer George Moncur was sold to Barnsley for \u00a3500,000. In his first match in charge on 6 August, McGreal guided his side to a 1\u20131 opening day draw away to Hartlepool United. He earned his first win on 13 August as his side defeated Cambridge United 2\u20130 at the Colchester Community Stadium. After three wins and one draw in Colchester's opening five league fixtures, McGreal was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for August. After an eleven-game winless run, McGreal's side went undefeated in December, earning ten points from a possible twelve which propelled Colchester up the League Two table away from the relegation zone. In turn, McGreal was shortlisted for the League Two Manager of the Month award for December. He won the award on 6 January 2017, becoming the first Colchester manager to win the award since Paul Lambert in January 2009. Later that month he signed Sean Murray on a free transfer from Swindon Town. The \"U's\" finished the season eighth in the table, one place and one point behind Blackpool in the play-offs, who would go on to achieve promotion. McGreal released eight players, whilst also losing top-scorer Chris Porter, who left on a free transfer to sign with Crewe Alexandra.", "He signed a number of young players to replace those that had departed: Kwame Poku, Luke Gambin, Omar Sowunmi, Jevani Brown, Cohen Bramall and Callum Harriott. More senior players Paris Cowan-Hall and Dean Gerken were also signed, whilst Theo Robinson joined on a season-long loan from Southend United. Having made an indifferent start to the 2019\u201320 League Two season, Colchester entered the play-offs for the first time with a 3\u20131 win at Leyton Orient on Boxing day. The team reached the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup, eliminating both Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur on penalties after holding both Premier League teams to 0\u20130 draws. In the quarter-finals they were beaten 3\u20130 by Manchester United at Old Trafford. The season ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England and the table was decided on points per game with Colchester in the play-offs in sixth-place. However the club announced that 16 players would be released at their end of their contracts, with chairman Robbie Cowling admitting that he \"would have been determined to re-sign\" Brandon Comley, Ryan Jackson, Frank Nouble and Luke Prosser in normal circumstances. Colchester lost out to Exeter City after extra-time in the play-off semi-finals and McGreal was subsequently dismissed by the club on 14 July 2020 as Cowling felt that \"significant changes are required that will be best served with a new head coach\". McGreal said he was \"deeply saddened\" with the decision to end his 11-year association with the club and that \"the memories of this season will live with me forever\"."]}, {"page": "Sean Clohessy", "response": ["The 2012\u201313 season continued in similar fashion for Clohessy, holding down a regular starting berth as he registered his first goal of the campaign in a 3\u20131 win over Cheltenham Town on 15 September 2012, netting the equaliser. With that goal, he ended a 21-month-long goal drought, in which time he had played 83 matches without scoring. He played his 150th game for the Shrimpers on 16 February 2013 when they took on Northampton Town, a game which the Blues lost 2\u20131. He earned the captains armband from Luke Prosser who had been deputising for injured club captain Chris Barker on 2 March 2013. He then scored two goals in two games, the first in a 2\u20131 win against Port Vale on 9 March, and the second in a 3\u20131 loss to Wimbledon three days later. Clohessy also helped Southend to the 2013 Football League Trophy Final, where Southend took on Crewe at Wembley Stadium on 7 April 2013.

He made his debut for the \"Whites\" as a substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town at the Raymond McEnhill Stadium, former Vale teammate Kyle Perry was the goalscorer. He played seven games, mostly as a substitute, before returning to Vale Park. By mid-November, his impressive performances in the reserves showed a new 'appetite for the game', and earned him a place on the first-team bench. Before the month was out he was loaned out Rochdale, also of League Two. He returned to the Vale in early January, having played just two games as a late substitute, totalling just 25 minutes on the field. His opportunities at Spotland were limited by an in-form strike force and match postponements due to poor weather. Rochdale did not extend the loan spell, reportedly due to financial difficulties. However Glover said that the loan spell helped to boost his confidence. He still received abuse from some at Vale Park though, almost a year after his father's departure. In March 2010 he was informed that he would not be offered a new contract at the Vale at the end of the season, along with fellow youth graduates Luke Prosser and Ross Davidson.
