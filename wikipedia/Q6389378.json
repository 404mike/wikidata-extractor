She started as a backing vocalist for Gary Numan, D:Ream and Blur, and quickly developed a career of her own. She is known among video game music aficionados for working with award-winning composer Richard Jacques on the soundtracks of Sonic R and Metropolis Street Racer. She was a member of ABBA tribute band Bj\u00f6rn Again, performing as 'Frida Longstockin' from 1997 to 2004.\nHer track, \"Brilliant Feeling\", billed as Full Monty Allstars featuring TJ Davis, peaked at #72 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1996. She also released the trance single \"Wonderful Life\" - a cover of the song by Colin Vearncombe - in December 2001. It was a collaboration with trance outfit Ian van Dahl, and reached #42 on the UK Singles Chart.\nIn 2002, Davis recorded the vocals on the Sash! song, \"I Believe\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sonic R", "response": ["The soundtrack for Sonic R was composed by British composer Richard Jacques of Sega Europe, who had also previously worked on the soundtrack of the Sega Saturn and PC versions of Sonic 3D Blast. Work on the soundtrack began in March 1997 when Jacques travelled to Japan to meet with Sonic creator Yuji Naka to discuss the musical approach to take for the game. The first song written was \"Super Sonic Racing\", which would be used for the game's reveal in June at E3. British singer TJ Davis provided the vocals for the song, which Naka liked so much that he requested that she be featured in all the game's songs. Jacques wrote all the lyrics for the songs with the intention that they would complement the on-screen action but still be appealing to someone who had never played the game. Tracks were recorded and programmed at Sega Digital Studios, and then worked on for two weeks at Metropolis Studios in London, where a week was spent on vocals, and a week was spent on producing, mixing, and finalising the tracks. Jacques stated that this task was amongst the most difficult in his career because the lyrics needed to \"really mean something\". Sonic R features two separate mixes of each song in its in-game soundtrack; ones with vocals and instrumental versions, giving the player the option to disable vocals. An official soundtrack CD was released on 21 January 1998.Official Guide, p. 112."]}, {"page": "Metropolis Street Racer", "response": ["Metropolis Street Racer was also the first racer to have radio stations and DJs talking between music tracks.
