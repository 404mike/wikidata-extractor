A successful businessman he was a tea merchant and a commercial traveller. His company, John O'Mahoney & Co., was located on Middle Abbey St., and was destroyed during the 1916 Easter Rising. It subsequently reestablished on Parnell Square. He subsequently purchased and ran Fleming's Hotel which was located at 31-32 Gardiner Place, Dublin. A close friend of Arthur Griffith, he became an organiser for Sinn F\u00e9in and was elected to Dublin Corporation for the party.\nHe participated in the Easter Rising and was subsequently interned at Frongoch and Lincoln Jail. He remained with Sinn F\u00e9in after it was re-constituted as a republican party at the 1917 Ardfheis.\nHe was arrested during the German Plot of 1917 and was jailed in Lincoln Gaol in England. While imprisoned he was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in MP for Fermanagh South in the 1918 general election. He was released from prison in 1919 and attended the proceedings of the First D\u00e1il. He was re-arrested at the Sinn F\u00e9in offices in November 1919 and was imprisoned for three months in England. He would be arrested several more times throughout the Anglo-Irish War and his hotel was used as a meeting place by Sinn F\u00e9in members throughout the time.\nHe was elected in the 1921 general election to the Second D\u00e1il for Fermanagh and Tyrone. As a result of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 this election was to provide the membership of two assemblies: the Southern Ireland House of Commons and the Northern Ireland House of Commons. The eight seat Fermanagh-Tyrone constituency was one of several in the Northern Ireland House of Commons. As members of Sinn F\u00e9in did not recognise either assembly he and the other five Sinn F\u00e9in TDs continued to attend the D\u00e1il. During the debates on the Anglo-Irish Treaty he opposed ratification of the document and voted against ratification. He left the D\u00e1il with \u00c9amon de Valera and the other Anti-Treaty TDs.\nAs the only member of the Second D\u00e1il not elected to the Southern Ireland House of Commons, his status in the Third D\u00e1il in 1922 was unclear. O'Mahony was not invited to attend the opening of the Provisional Parliament. De Valera was keen for him to attend since if he had been refused entry it would have demonstrated, in the minds of Anti-Treaty supporters, that the assembly was not an All-Ireland D\u00e1il. In the end O'Mahony did not attend, but his case was taken up by Laurence Ginnell. O'Mahony remained an abstentionist MP to Stormont until the 1925 Northern Ireland general election, when he did not stand for re-election.\nHe remained with Sinn F\u00e9in after the 1926 split, serving on the party's Ard Chomairle until his death.\nHe died in 1934. His funeral was attended by representatives of Sinn F\u00e9in, the Irish Republican Army, Fianna F\u00e1il, Fianna \u00c9ireann, Cumann na mBan, and Mn\u00e1 na Poblachta. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.\nHe was survived by his wife, and a son, Malachy, and a daughter, M\u00e1ire.\nThe Gaelic football club Se\u00e1n O'Mahony's (Dundalk) is named after him.", "link_mentions": {}}}
