This was followed by the 1994 Indy Lights championship (both with Tasman Motorsports). He captured 7 wins during his 2 years in the series. He is one of only three Indy Lights champions to never race in Champ Car/IndyCar, the others being 1996 champion David Empringham and 2010 champion Jean-Karl Vernay.\nHe later raced in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in 1996, in a works Ford Mondeo. However, the car was not competitive and he finished 20th in the championship with only two points. In the first race of the season at Donington Park, he spun in front of his teammate Paul Radisich, and Radisich was unable to avoid colliding with him.After racing, Robertson went on, along with his father Dave, to manage young drivers. After leading Jenson Button to Formula One, the pair took on Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen would later make a big jump, from Formula Renault in the UK through to F1 with the Sauber team, the following year. Robertson continued to manage R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen throughout his career.In November 2004, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Robertson formed a racing team for the British F3 International Series (as it is now called), R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen Robertson Racing. In their second season with the help of Senna's F1 Engineer James Robinson (2006), \"Double R\" won the main Championship Class, with Brit Mike Conway.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen", "response": ["Despite the disappointment of the 2004 season, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was still seen as one of the rising stars of the sport, along with BAR's Button, Renault's Alonso and 2005 McLaren teammate Montoya. Many pundits predicted 2005 to be filled with great on-track battles from a resurgent team. He was also referred to by Ross Brawn and Jean Todt as a driver whom Ferrari might consider in the future. In early November 2004, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen announced his intention to create a racing team with his manager Steve Robertson, to be entitled R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen Robertson Racing (otherwise known as \"Double R\"), which would compete in Formula Three in 2005.", "R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen qualified third at the . Before the race, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen pushed noted photographer Paul-Henri Cahier to the ground as he lined up a close-up shot. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's manager Steve Robertson claimed the driver was provoked by Cahier touching him with his lens and standing on his belongings, but Cahier disputed this version of events.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  The race was in wet conditions and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen stayed third at the first corner behind Hamilton and Kovalainen. He kept pace and got up to second when Kovalainen spun. He then chased after Hamilton, and set the fastest lap as he drew up directly behind the McLaren. During the first pitstop, Ferrari did not change the intermediates on his car in the hope that the track would become dry. However, the track was hit by another shower, and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen rapidly lost pace, and dropped down to sixth before finally pitting for new tyres. He finished fourth, a lap down.", "On 17 November 2009, his manager Steve Robertson confirmed that R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen would not drive in Formula One in the 2010 season. But during 2010 itself, rumours emerged once again about another possible R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen comeback this time with the Renault team in . This followed a resurgence in Renault's form, and the fact that the Russian Vitaly Petrov had yet to be re-signed like team-mate Robert Kubica. Team principal \u00c9ric Boullier claimed he had been contacted by R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in connection with a possible return, but said that although he was flattered by R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's alleged display of interest:", "R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen had to retire from the first race of the season in Australia due to a loose wheel following a pitstop. Following that mishap, he recovered to finish fourth both in Malaysia and China. Another pit issue befell R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen during practice for the  as he was reprimanded for exiting the pitlane in a 'potentially dangerous manner' by the stewards, having swerved around a standing car in an undesignated area. However, he escaped a possible grid penalty. During the same weekend, his manager Steve Robertson suggested that R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was heading towards a contract extension with Ferrari. That would contradict previous suggestions from R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen himself that he would 'probably' retire at the end of his Ferrari contract, and that 2015 would be his last season. Courtesy of a considerate tyre strategy by the Ferrari team, at the , R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen finished second after gaining that position late in the race and starting from fourth on the grid. In the process, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen recorded his first podium since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix for Lotus, and the first in his second spell with Ferrari\u00a0\u2013 his most recent Ferrari podium was a third place finish at the 2009 Italian Grand Prix. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen said that he was hopeful in winning races in the near future after the team's strong recovery relative to . He also commented that, both the engine and downforce had been significantly improved and that the car handled much more to his liking. In a post-race interview, Ferrari team boss, Maurizio Arrivabene, described this result as a sign that R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen \"is back\" and that he \"showed what a race animal he is\", also implying that if he had a few more race laps available, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen would have challenged Hamilton for the race win."]}, {"page": "List of companies named after people", "response": ["* Double R Racing, formerly R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen Robertson Racing \u2013 Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Steve Robertson"]}, {"page": "Grand Prix of Long Beach", "response": ["|  Steve Robertson", "|  Steve Robertson"]}, {"page": "Indy Lights", "response": ["|  Steve Robertson"]}, {"page": "Grand Prix of Toronto", "response": ["|  Steve Robertson"]}, {"page": "Bruno Senna", "response": ["In 2005, he moved on to the British Formula Three Championship, driving for the R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen Robertson Racing team owned by then-McLaren Formula One driver Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and his business managers David and Steve Robertson.
