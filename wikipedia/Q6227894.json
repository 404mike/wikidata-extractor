After the enemy's front line had been captured, Private Cunningham went with a bombing section up a communication trench where much opposition was met and all the rest of the section were either killed or wounded. Collecting all the bombs from the casualties Private Cunningham went on alone and when he had used up all the bombs he had he returned for a fresh supply and again went up the communication trench where he met a party of 10 Germans. He killed all 10 and cleared the trench up to the new line.His Victoria Cross is displayed at York Army Museum, England.\nJohn was married to Eva Harrison in June 1917 at Hull and had two children, Annie who died in infancy and John who was born in 1920 at Hull.
