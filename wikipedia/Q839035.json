As a result, he missed out on a Premier League winners' medal as he managed only three league appearances all season, all of which came after Chelsea had secured the trophy. He did, however, feature in most of Chelsea's FA Cup and League Cup games that season. Chelsea reached the 2005 Football League Cup Final, however Cudicini was suspended as he had been sent off in an FA Cup tie the week before against Newcastle United.

He rejected advice to take an older mentor as his assistant and instead retained existing coaches Richard Cooper and Micky Moore, who he said were \"as hungry as I am for coaching\". Murray's first game as manager, a day later at Field Mill, was a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle. After a successful month as caretaker-manager, Murray was given the job on a permanent basis on 5 December, becoming the youngest manager in the top four divisions of English football. He made four free transfer signings in the January transfer window: defenders Junior Brown, Michael Raynes and Matty Blair, and midfielder Ricky Ravenhill. He sold Rob Taylor to Tranmere Rovers after the versatile player sought a move closer to his home. He also made use of the loan market, bringing in Billy Kee, Callum Elder, Lenny Pidgeley, Jeffrey Monakana, Adam Smith and Terry Hawkridge. Murray signed a new two-year contract in May. Mansfield ended the 2014\u201315 season in 21st-place, seven points above relegated Cheltenham Town, and Murray released seven players in the summer, saying that \"I feel the whole club needs a fresh start\".
