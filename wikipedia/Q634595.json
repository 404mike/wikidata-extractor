He probably sang in the choir of St. Paul's Cathedral from 1594, when a Thomas Raniscroft was listed on the choir rolls and remained there until 1600 under the directorship of Thomas Giles. He received his bachelor's degree in 1605 from Cambridge.Ravenscroft's principal contributions are his collections of folk music, including catches, rounds, street cries, vendor songs, \"freeman's songs\" and other anonymous music, in three collections: Pammelia (1609), Deuteromelia or The Seconde Part of Musicks Melodie (1609) and Melismata (1611), which contains one of the best-known works in his collections, The Three Ravens. Some of the music he compiled has acquired extraordinary fame, though his name is rarely associated with the music; for example \"Three Blind Mice\" first appears in Deuteromelia. He also published a metrical psalter (The Whole Booke of Psalmes) in 1621. \n\nAs a composer, his works are mostly forgotten but include 11 anthems, 3 motets for five voices and 4 fantasias for viols. \nAs a writer, he wrote two treatises on music theory. The Briefe Discourse of the True (but Neglected) Use of Charact'ring the Degrees (London, 1614) includes 20 songs as examples: seven by John Bennet, two by Edward Pearce and the rest by Ravenscroft himself. Of these, the group of dialect songs 'Hodge und Malkyn' from the fifth a final section was nominated by Jeffrey Mark as the earliest example of a song-cycle in English music history. There is also A Treatise of Musick, which remains in manuscript (unpublished).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Round (music)", "response": ["The term \"round\" first appears in English in the early 16th century, though the form was found much earlier. In medieval England, they were called rota or rondellus. Later, an alternative term was \"roundel\" (e.g., David Melvill's manuscript Ane Buik off Roundells, Aberdeen, 1612). Special types of rounds are the \"catch\" (a comic English form found from about 1580 to 1800), and a specialized use of the word \"canon\", in 17th- and 18th-century England designating rounds with religious texts. The oldest surviving round in English is \"Sumer Is Icumen In\"  , which is for four voices, plus two bass voices singing a ground (that is, a never-changing repeating part), also in canon. However, the earliest known rounds are two works with Latin texts found in the eleventh fascicle of the Notre Dame manuscript Pluteo 29.1. They are Leto leta concio (a two-voice round) and O quanto consilio (a four-voice round). The former dates from before 1180 and may be of German origin.

Tallis wrote nine psalm chant tunes for four voices for Archbishop Matthew Parker's Psalter published in 1567. One of the nine tunes was the \"Third Mode Melody\" which inspired the composition of Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis by Ralph Vaughan Williams in 1910. His setting of Psalm 67 became known as \"Tallis's Canon\", and the setting by Thomas Ravenscroft is an adaptation for the hymn \"All praise to thee, my God, this night\"  (1709) by Thomas Ken, and it has become his best-known composition. The Injunctions, however, also allowed a more elaborate piece of music to be sung in church at certain times of the day, and many of Tallis's more complex Elizabethan anthems may have been sung in this context, or alternatively by the many families that sang sacred polyphony at home. Tallis's better-known works from the Elizabethan years include his settings of the Lamentations (of Jeremiah the Prophet) for the Holy Week services and the unique motet Spem in alium written for eight five-voice choirs, for which he is most remembered. He also produced compositions for other monarchs, and several of his anthems written in Edward's reign are judged to be on the same level as his Elizabethan works, such as \"If Ye Love Me\". Records are incomplete on his works from previous periods; 11 of his 18 Latin-texted pieces from Elizabeth's reign were published, \"which ensured their survival in a way not available to the earlier material\"."]}, {"page": "Nine Lessons and Carols", "response": [":*Carol: \"Remember, O Thou Man\" \u2013 words, 16th century; music by Thomas Ravenscroft"]}, {"page": "Song cycle", "response": ["The songs are either for solo voice or an ensemble, or rarely a combination of solo songs mingled with choral pieces.One example is the set of Schubert songs from The Lady of the Lake.
