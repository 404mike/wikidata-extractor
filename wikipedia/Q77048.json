The team, including Eric Maskell whose report \"Flow Separation in Three Dimensions\" contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow,Three Centuries To Concorde, Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, , p.236 worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortices on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack. The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by Chuck Yeager in the Convair XF-92, but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be used deliberately to improve low speed performance."]}, {"page": "Area rule", "response": ["Subsequent German wartime aircraft design took account of the discovery, evident in slim mid-fuselage of aircraft including the Messerschmitt P.1112, P.1106 and Focke-Wulf 1000x1000x1000 type A long-range bomber, but also apparent in delta wing designs including the Henschel Hs 135. Several other researchers came close to developing a similar theory, notably Dietrich K\u00fcchemann who designed a tapered fighter that was dubbed the \"K\u00fcchemann Coke Bottle\" when it was discovered by US forces in 1946. In this case K\u00fcchemann arrived at the theory by studying airflow, notably the interference, or local flow streamlines, at the junction between a fuselage and swept wing. The fuselage was contoured, or waisted, to match the flow. The shaping requirement of this \"near field\" approach would also result from Whitcomb's later \"far field\" approach to drag reduction using his Sonic area rule.Design For Combat Aircraft,Ray Whitford 1987,,Fig.161"]}, {"page": "List of aerospace engineers", "response": ["* Dietrich K\u00fcchemann (1911\u20131976)"]}, {"page": "Swept wing", "response": ["One limiting factor in swept wing design is the so-called \"middle effect\". If a swept wing is continuous \u2013 an oblique swept wing, the pressure iso-bars will be swept at a continuous angle from tip to tip. However, if the left and right halves are swept back equally, as is common practice, the pressure iso-bars on the left wing in theory will meet the pressure iso-bars of the right wing on the centerline at a large angle.  As the iso-bars cannot meet in such a fashion, they will tend to curve on each side as they near the centerline, so that the iso-bars cross the centerline at right angles to the centerline. This causes an \"unsweeping\" of the iso-bars in the wing root region.  To combat this unsweeping, German aerodynamicist Dietrich K\u00fcchemann proposed and had tested a local indentation of the fuselage above and below the wing root. This proved to not be very effective.Meier, Hans-Ulrich, editor German Development of the Swept Wing 1935\u20131945, AIAA Library of Flight, 2010.

The extension beyond the trailing edge was considered secondary to the body on the wing surface which slowed the supersonic flow to give a weaker shock and acted as a fence to prevent outward flow.

Lift is generated in different ways at supersonic speeds and achieving reasonable lift-to-drag ratios requires the wings to have a very short span. This works well at supersonic speeds, but offers very little lift at low speed. In order to make a design that is able to take off and land on existing runways, either the aircraft would have to use wider wings and lose supersonic cruise economy, have enormous engine power, or be extremely large. A way out of this dilemma was presented in Britain by Johanna Weber and Dietrich K\u00fcchemann around 1955. Their team at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) noticed that delta wings generated large vortexes over the wing when flying at low speeds and high angles of attack (\"alpha\")."]}, {"page": "Dietrich Kuchemann", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dietrich K\u00fcchemann "]}, {"page": "Dietrich Kuechemann", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dietrich K\u00fcchemann "]}, {"page": "List of German inventors and discoverers", "response": ["* Dietrich K\u00fcchemann: Aeronautical pioneer, developed wings for supersonic speed, such as delta wings as used in the Concorde."]}, {"page": "Blue Envoy", "response": ["The initial layout, developed by Dietrich K\u00fcchemann, had the main portion of the wing swept at 75 degrees, lowered to 42 degrees outboard of the vertical stabilizers.
