A Japanese business owner living in the same building had told him that Japanese troops were on their way, approaching not around Singapore from the sea, as expected by the British, but from Kota Bharu in Kelantan, with bicycle infantry and rubber boats. The policeman informed the British Chief Police Officer in Ipoh, but his claim was laughed off. By 26 December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) had arrived in Ipoh, the capital, moving southwards from Thailand. The following day they went on to Taiping, leaving destruction and heavy casualties in their wake. The British forces, retreating from the north of the Malay Peninsula under Lieutenant-General Lewis Heath, had moved a further  to the Perak River, damaging the route behind them to slow the Japanese advance. With the approval of Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, the British mounted a defensive stand near the river mouth and in Kampar, leaving the towns of Ipoh, Kuala Kangsar and Taiping unguarded."]}, {"page": "East African campaign (World War II)", "response": ["In 1940, East Africa Force (Major-General Douglas Dickinson) was established for North East Africa, East Africa and British Central Africa.

The Keren defences had been reinforced with the arrival of 6th Colonial Brigade from Metemma and also the 11th Blackshirt Battalion of the Savoia Grenadiers. The defenders now totalled 25,000 facing an attacking force which had grown to more than 13,000. Beresford-Pierce would launch the 11th Indian Brigade, expanded to five battalions under command, against the peaks of the Sanchil mass and 5th Brigade against Mount Sammana on the left of his front.

Gazelle Force (Colonel Frank Messervy), based on Skinner's Horse, No. 1 Motor Machine-Gun Group of the SDF and a varying amount of field and horse artillery, was assembled near Kassala to probe forwards, to harass the Italians and keep them off-balance to make an impression of a much larger force and encourage a defensive mentality. By using the term Five instead of 5th in all communications, the British managed to persuade Italian military intelligence that five Indian divisions occupied the 5th Indian Division area. In November, after the failed British attack at Gallabat, Gazelle Force operated from the Gash river delta against Italian advanced posts around Kassala on the Ethiopian plateau, to the extent that Aosta ordered Frusci, the commander of the Northern Sector to challenge the British raiders.

News of the Italian disaster in Egypt, the harassment by Gazelle Force and the activities of Mission 101 in Ethiopia, led to the Italians withdrawing their northern flank to Keru and Wachai and then on 18 January to retreat hurriedly from Kassala, Tessenei and the triangle of Keru, Biscia and Aicota. Wavell ordered Platt to begin the March offensive early on 9 February and to begin on 19 January, when it seemed that Italian morale was crumbling. Wireless decrypts greatly aided British preparations and the decision to attack ahead of schedule. The Italian withdrawal led Wavell to order a pursuit and the troops arriving at Port Sudan (Briggs Force) to attack at Karora and advance parallel to the coast, to meet the forces coming from the west."]}, {"page": "Battle of Keren order of battle", "response": ["(Major-General Lewis Heath)"]}, {"page": "Mario Bonetti", "response": ["Bonetti was also the commander of the Massawa Fortress Area and its garrison, which numbered about 10,000 men; after the end of the Battle of Keren, this was the last Italian military presence in Eritrea, along with a few hundred men in the Assab naval base.I.

Bonetti twice refused the ultimatum; on April 8, the 7th and 10th Indian Infantry Brigade simultaneously attacked Massawa, supported by tanks of the 4th Royal Tank Regiment, Free French troops and the RAF, which bombed Italian artillery positions. While the attack of the 7th Indian Brigade was repelled, the 10th Indian Brigade and the tanks managed to penetrate the defenses on the western side, while the Gaullist forces broke through in the southwestern sector. Bonetti capitulated in the afternoon of April 8, after having as much equipment as possible dumped into the harbor."]}]}}
