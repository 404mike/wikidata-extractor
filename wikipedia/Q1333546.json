They sought a version more appropriate than the original for 19th-century women and children. Bowdler also published works reflecting an interest in and knowledge of continental Europe. His last work was an expurgation of Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published posthumously in 1826 under the supervision of his nephew and biographer, Thomas Bowdler the Younger. The term bowdlerize links his name with expurgation or omission of elements deemed unsuited to children, in literature and films and on television.", "link_mentions": {}}}
