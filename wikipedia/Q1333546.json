They sought a version they saw as more appropriate than the original for 19th-century women and children. Bowdler also published works reflecting an interested knowledge of continental Europe. His last work was an expurgation of Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published posthumously in 1826 under the supervision of his nephew and biographer, Thomas Bowdler the Younger.

A few years later in the 1820s, a set of four tunnels were hand-carved by Welsh miners to permit access to the beaches by horse-drawn carriage as well as by foot. Previously access was gained by climbing the cliffs, rounding the point by boat, swimming or at the lowest tides clambering around the rocks of the point. These tunnels led to a pair of tidal pools, which in accordance with Victorian morals, were used for segregated male and female bathing. Whereas women were constrained to a strict dress code covering up the whole body, men generally swam naked. The tunnels are still viewable and are signposted as Tunnels Beaches."]}, {"page": "Censorship in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Thomas Bowdler whose name is now used as the verb \"bowdlerise\" or \"bowdlerize\""]}, {"page": "List of physicians", "response": ["* Thomas Bowdler \u2014 censor"]}, {"page": "List of eponyms (A\u2013K)", "response": ["* Thomas Bowdler, British publisher \u2013 to bowdlerize"]}, {"page": "Bowdler", "response": ["* Henrietta Maria Bowdler (1750\u20131830), writer and expurgator of Shakespeare, sister of Jane, John and Thomas Bowdler", "*John Bowdler (1746-1823), moral reformer and brother of Henrietta and Thomas Bowdler", "* Thomas Bowdler (1754\u20131825), English physician, publisher and editor of the Family Shakespeare (1818), inspiration of the term bowdlerisation", "*Thomas Bowdler the Younger (1782-1856), Church of England priest and nephew and editor of Thomas Bowdler"]}, {"page": "Reputation of William Shakespeare", "response": ["The only aspects of Shakespeare's plays that were consistently disliked and singled out for criticism in the 18th century were the puns (\"clenches\") and the \"low\" (sexual) allusions.
