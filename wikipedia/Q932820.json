He was Sterling Professor of History at Yale University from 1993 to 2008. His most widely read book is The Search for Modern China, a survey of the last several hundred years of Chinese history based on his popular course at Yale. A prolific author, reviewer, and essayist, he published more than a dozen books on China. Spence's major interest was modern China, especially the Qing dynasty, and relations between China and the West. Spence frequently used biographies to examine cultural and political history. Another common theme is the efforts of both Westerners and Chinese \"to change China\", and how such efforts were frustrated.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 11", "response": ["*  1936   \u2013 Jonathan Spence, English-American historian and academic"]}, {"page": "Ming dynasty", "response": ["Wang Gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because \u2013 following the trend already apparent in the Song dynasty \u2013 communities in Ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking.

Jonathan Spence writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in Ming China, since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city. Not only was the blurring of town and country evident, but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations (Sh\u00ec n\u00f3ng g\u014dng sh\u0101ng, ), since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods, and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth."]}, {"page": "Zhou Enlai", "response": ["* The Mystery of Zhou Enlai by Jonathan Spence from The New York Review of Books"]}, {"page": "Nanjing Massacre", "response": ["Jonathan Spence writes:Spence, Jonathan D.
