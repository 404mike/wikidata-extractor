His opening words were \"This is Radio Caroline on 199, your all-day music station\".The first song played on Radio Caroline was by the Rolling Stones. At its peak in 1967, the station had millions of listeners, and it revolutionised radio broadcasting in the UK. In 1991, Moore was interviewed extensively for the BBC TV show A Pirate's Tale, where he described his key role in detail.\nMoore is a member of the Pirate Radio Hall of Fame. Moore, who had variously been a club DJ, merchant naval steward, and photographer, had become involved in Radio Caroline when he met the station's founder, Ronan O'Rahilly. Moore's Chelsea flatmate, Ian Ross (later a novelist), introduced O'Rahilly to his father, New Zealand-born Charles Ross, who in turn helped O'Rahilly raise the \u00a3250,000 needed to start what became Britain's first pirate radio station in April 1964.Although Moore was the first voice to be heard on Radio Caroline, the first programme was hosted by Simon Dee, who subsequently became a TV chat show host of Dee Time on the BBC.\nMoore died on 2 January 2021 at the age of 80.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Moore", "response": ["Christopher Moore is the name of:", "*Christopher Moore (author) (born 1957), American author", "*Christopher Moore (Canadian historian) (born 1950), author and journalist", "*Christopher Moore (born 1993), Young Money Entertainment recording artist better known by his stage name, Lil Twist", "*Christopher Moore (DJ) (born 1941), British/American radio broadcaster for Radio Carolina", "*Christopher Moore (sculptor) (1790\u20131863),  Irish-born sculptor", "*Christopher Moore (Australian musician), Australian viola player", "*Christopher Moore (Minister), founder of the Chicago Children's Choir", "*Christopher Moore (American musical theatre writer/composer)(born 1960)"]}]}}
