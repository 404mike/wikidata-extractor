He was also selected for All-England in major matches and was often a given man.  He was an all-rounder though noted mainly as a bowler, but of unknown type and pace.  He was a nephew of Robert Colchin.\nCricket's statistical record began in the 1772 season, by when Colchin's career was already well advanced.  He was recorded in 11 first-class matches from 1773 to 1778 and also in single wicket contests, the form of cricket in which his famous uncle thrived.  He was last mentioned playing in a \"fives\" match in June 1779.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Cricketers of My Time", "response": ["Numerous Georgian players are described in the book but, as the newest version's editor has pointed out, there are several omissions including John Boorman, William Bowra, William Bullen, Robert Clifford, Samuel Colchin, John Edmeads, William Fennex and Richard Aubrey Veck; while other notable players such as Francis Booker, Robert Robinson and Thomas Scott receive only the briefest of mentions.Nyren (ed.
