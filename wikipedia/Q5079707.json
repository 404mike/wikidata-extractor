Therefore, he occasionally read to Fanny and Mary from Sarah Trimmer's Fabulous Histories (1786) and Anna Laetitia Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778\u201379), but, according to Todd, he did not take great pains with their educations and disregarded the books Wollstonecraft had written for Fanny.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 45\u201346, 63. William St Clair, in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, argues that Godwin and Wollstonecraft spoke extensively about the education they wanted for their children and that Godwin's writings in The Enquirer reflect these discussions. He contends that after Wollstonecraft's death Godwin wrote to a former pupil to whom she had been close, now Lady Mountcashell, asking her advice on how to raise and educate his daughters.St Clair, 280\u201381. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour agrees with St Clair, arguing that \"everything we know about his daughter's [Mary's and presumably Fanny's] early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her mother would have approved\", pointing out that she had a governess, a tutor, a French-speaking stepmother, and a father who wrote children's books whose drafts he read to his own first.Seymour, 53. It was the new Mrs Godwin who was primarily responsible for the education given to the girls, but she taught her own daughter more, including French.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 63. Fanny received no formal education after her stepfather's marriage. Yet, the adult Imlay is described by Charles Kegan Paul, one of Godwin's earliest biographers, as \"well educated, sprightly, clever, a good letter-writer, and an excellent domestic manager\".Paul, C. Kegan. William Godwin. Retrieved 1 June 2007; see also St Clair, 399. Fanny excelled in drawing and was taught music.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 63\u201364. Despite Godwin's atheism, all of the children were taken to an Anglican church.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 64."]}, {"page": "Clergy Support Trust", "response": ["* Direct employment as a curate, teacher, chaplain, or tutor. For example, Charles Kegan Paul, the founder of the publisher C. Kegan Paul, was employed as a tutor to pupils travelling to Germany for a year. He then appointed to a chaplaincy at Eton College and then to the new post of Master in College for which he was paid \u00a3120. He was allowed to supplement this by taking on two private pupils. Many clergy took private pupils as a way of supplementing their income. Paul's father had been forced to take on private pupils when the income from his West Indian holdings dried up. Curates might only be paid \u00a350 a year, along with their board.", "* Benefices commonly called livings, most of which benefited from Tithes and the Glebe, but some of which were Perpetual Curates. About half of the 10,500 livings were in the gift of the local squire. The remaining half were controlled by the crown, bishops, cathedral chapters, the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, and other institutions. In 1805, just over half (55%) of young clergymen could obtain such livings. A parliamentary inquiry in 1802 found that about 1,000 livings were worth less than \u00a3100 a year, and another 3,000 worth between \u00a3100 and \u00a3150. The picture was the same 30 years later and a tenth of beneficed clergymen received less than \u00a3100 a year. Of course, a clergyman might hold more than one living. This was known as pluralism. Jane Austen's clergyman father, George Austen, held two livings, at Steventon, Hampshire and at Deane, Hampshire. When George Austen retired he installed his son James as curate for both the livings he held, but retained the tithe income from Steventon as a form of pension. James Austen already held his own parish and with the curacies in Steventon and Deane, he now held three parishes, and was offered a fourth. The Pluralities Act of 1838 forbade clergymen having more than one benefice except under specific conditions. Charles Kegan Paul considered that the living he has been presented to by Eton College at Sturminster Marshall was a living of small value, bring worth less than \u00a3300. Paul supplemented his income by taking six pupils at \u00a3100 each per year. However, he noted that the presence of such unrelated young people in the home destroyed family life sadly. The desirable minimum income for a clergyman was thought to be \u00a3400, which was an upper middle-class income. Jervis reported that 6,750 parochial benefices were worth less than \u00a3300."]}, {"page": "Eden Paul", "response": ["Paul was the younger son of the publisher Charles Kegan Paul,Beatrice Webb, My Apprenticeship, 1979, pp. 268-9 and Margaret Colvile.
