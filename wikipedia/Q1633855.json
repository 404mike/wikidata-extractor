With Harry P. Karstens, he co-led the first expedition to successfully climb Denali (Mount McKinley) in June 1913, via the South Summit. He published five books about his years in Alaska. Two memoirs were issued in new editions in 1988, including his account of the ascent of Denali.\nStuck was born in London and graduated from King's College London. He immigrated to the United States in 1885 and lived there for the rest of his life. After working as a cowboy and teacher for several years in Texas, he went to University of the South to study theology. After graduation, he was ordained as an Episcopal priest. Moving to Alaska in 1904, he served as Archdeacon of the Yukon, acting as a missionary for the church and a proponent of \"muscular Christianity\". He died of pneumonia in Fort Yukon, Alaska.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 22", "response": ["*Hudson Stuck (Episcopal Church)"]}, {"page": "1920", "response": ["* October 10 \u2013 Hudson Stuck, English mountaineer (b. 1865)"]}, {"page": "Fort Yukon, Alaska", "response": ["* Hudson Stuck, Episcopal priest, social reformer, and mountain climber"]}, {"page": "Nenana, Alaska", "response": ["In 1905 the Episcopal Church, which had missionaries in Alaska, built the St. Mark's Episcopal mission and Tortella School a short distance upriver.

Stuck was an English-born Episcopal priest who came to Alaska by chance. He became acclimated to the often harsh Alaskan environment because of his many travels between far-flung outposts within his district, climbing mountains as a hobby. At 21 years old, Harper was already known as a skilled and strong outdoorsman, the Alaska-born son of a Koyukon-Athabascan mother and Irish gold prospector father. Tatum, also 21 years old, was a theology student working at a Tanana mission, and the least experienced of the team.
