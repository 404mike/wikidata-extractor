The battalion was sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front and landed in France in November 1914.

The battalion consisted mainly of men conscripted (or called up) straight from civilian for military service, with most of them coming from the Midlands. In October, the battalion joined the 213th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), alongside the 13th Royal Warwickshire Regiment, 14th South Staffordshire Regiment and 9th Royal Berkshire Regiment. In December, the battalion left the brigade and transferred to become the motorised infantry element of the 9th Support Group, part of the newly created 9th Armoured Division. In June 1942, the Support Group was disbanded and the battalion transferred to 24th Independent Guards Brigade Group and later to the 33rd Independent Guards Brigade Group, where the standard of foot drill was very high. The Commanding Officer (CO) of the battalion, Lieutenant Colonel William Reginald Cox of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry, put forth a proposal to the War Office for the old 1st Battalion, which had been destroyed at Tobruk during the Battle of Gazala in June 1942, to be reformed around the 11th Battalion. The proposal was accepted and so, on 31 December 1942, the 11th Battalion was disbanded. On 1 January 1943, it was renumbered the 1st Battalion, during a parade which included the Colonel of the Regiment George Grogan VC and Field Marshal Claud Jacob. The reformed 1st Battalion transferred, in September 1943, to the 214th Infantry Brigade, 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, alongside the 5th Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and 7th Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry. The battalion continued training in preparation for operations in North-Western Europe. Together with the rest of the 214th Brigade, the battalion landed in Normandy, as part of Operation Overlord, on 24 June 1944, and soon fought in Operation Epsom. On 18 November 1944, during Operation Clipper, the 1st Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment, moved across the Dutch-German border and commenced an attack on German soil to take the village of Tripsrath. Together with their parent unit, 214th Infantry Brigade, they were the first British troops to fight on German soil. Their job was to take the north-west side of Geilenkirchen to cover the left flank and support the American forces."]}, {"page": "George William St. George Grogan", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Grogan"]}, {"page": "Stubbington House School", "response": ["* George Grogan VC CB CMG DSO, army officer and Victoria Cross winner"]}, {"page": "Grogan", "response": ["* George Grogan (1875\u20131962), recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux", "response": ["As the German offensive ended on the Marne in early July, more fighting took place around Villers-Bretonneux, as part of diversionary moves by the Australians in support of the Battle of Hamel.
