In April, Taylor played in a University match against Loughborough where he scored his third double century with a score of 237, making it his highest first-class score. With teammate Shiv Thakor put on a record 330 runs for the fifth wicket meaning that Taylor now holds Leicestershire records for the fourth and fifth wicket partnerships. Thakor was quick to acknowledge Taylor for his calming influence on him. On 1 May, Taylor scored his third one-day century, a score of 101 against Warwickshire before being bowled by Chris Woakes. His next considerable contribution for Leicestershire was a County Championship game against Kent where he made scores of 49 and 96 in a Leicester defeat."]}, {"page": "List of Old Uppinghamians", "response": ["* Shiv Thakor, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Andrew Salter (cricketer)", "response": ["Salter managed to take a wicket with his very first career ball in the County Championship when he had Leicestershire's Shiv Thakor caught behind."]}, {"page": "Tom Alsop", "response": ["Tipped for a bright future and a big talent, Alsop was educated at Lavington School. Alsop has played for the Hampshire Cricket Academy in the Southern Premier Cricket League since 2010; during this time Alsop has finished within the top three averages of the league on more than one occasion. In the 2014 season he finished with the highest average in the league, 86.71, scoring 609 runs in just nine innings. In January 2013 he was called up to the England Under-19 following an injury to captain Shiv Thakor, playing four Youth One Day Internationals against South Africa Under-19s during the tour. In May 2013, he played two Minor Counties Trophy matches for Wiltshire against Lincolnshire and Suffolk. In that same month he was required as a substitute wicket-keeper for Hampshire in their Yorkshire Bank 40 match against Lancashire following an injury during the warm-up to Adam Wheater. During this YB40 game Alsop took a smart catch behind the stumps to dismiss Croft. For the start of the 2014 season, Alsop was awarded a development contract with Hampshire.  This was a result of impressing against a strong Surrey attack in a pre-season friendly. Later in the season he made his senior debut in a  List A match against Gloucestershire, however he was run-out for a duck by Craig Miles. The following day he made his Youth Test debut for England Under-19s against South Africa Under-19s, having been called up to the under-19 Test squad earlier in July. Alsop went on to impress immensely with the bat during the summer series against South Africa scoring 107 off 83 balls at Trent bridge, and then went on to score a half century the next day."]}, {"page": "Thakor (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Shiv Thakor (born 1993), English cricketer"]}]}}
