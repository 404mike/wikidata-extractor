The game ended 2\u20132. Peter Vincenti opened the scoring for the hosts after just six minutes; heading in Charlie Griffin's looping cross. Macclesfield equalised just four minutes later after Matt Hamshaw's cross was headed in by Nat Brown. Tyrone Barnett then put the away side ahead early in the second\u2013half. Stevenage levelled the game with just one minute remaining after Rob Sinclair cut in from the right and slid the ball to Charlie Griffin, who poked the ball past the on\u2013rushing Veiga. The club's first away game in the Football League ended in a 1\u20130 defeat against Bradford City at Valley Parade. Bradford striker Gareth Evans scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot in the first\u2013half in a game that was \"rough luck on the visitors\" having dominated large parts of the game. Stevenage won their first game of the season a week later, beating Stockport County 3\u20131 at Broadhall Way. Charlie Griffin opened the scoring with a looping header after half an hour, before Michael Bostwick's 30-yard effort found the top corner two minutes before the interval. Griffin added the third with a close range effort in the second-half, with Stockport's George Donnelly scoring a consolation goal in injury\u2013time. A week later, Stevenage travelled to Aldershot Town for their second away fixture of the season. The game ended all square, finishing 1\u20131. Chris Beardsley opened the scoring five minutes into the second-half, with Aldershot striker Damian Spencer equalising fifteen minutes later. With just five minutes remaining, Jon Ashton was adjudged to have fouled Spencer in the area, with referee Mark Halsey pointing to the spot. Marvin Morgan's resulting penalty was palmed away by Chris Day to ensure Stevenage earned their first point on the road."]}, {"page": "Nat (name)", "response": ["* Nat Brown (born 1981), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Nat Brown"]}, {"page": "Tony Diagne", "response": ["It was announced on 2 March 2013 that Diagne was rejoining former Macclesfield manager Gary Simpson at Lincoln City on loan, he joined the imps till the end of the season accompanied by former Imp and then Macclesfield captain Nat Brown.
