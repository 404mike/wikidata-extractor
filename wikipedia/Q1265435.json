During the 2015\u201316 academic year, he was a Visitor at the School of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.\nMcCargo is best known for his  writing on contemporary Thailand and Asia-related topics. His work deals mainly with the nature of power: how entrenched elites seek to retain it, and how challengers seek to undermine their legitimacy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thailand", "response": ["The politics of Thailand is conducted within the framework of a constitutional monarchy, whereby a hereditary monarch serves as head of state. The current King of Thailand is Vajiralongkorn (or Rama X), who has reigned since October 2016. The powers of the king are limited by the constitution and he is primarily a symbolic figurehead. The monarch is head of the armed forces and is required to be Buddhist as well as the Defender of the Faith. He has the power to appoint his heirs, the power to grant pardons, and the royal assent. The king is aided in his duties by the Privy Council of Thailand. However, the monarch still occasionally intervenes in Thai politics, as all constitutions pave the way for customary royal rulings. Some academics outside Thailand, including Duncan McCargo and Federico Ferrara, noted extraconstitutional role of the monarch through a \"network monarchy\" behind the political scenes.Duncan McCargo, Network monarchy and legitimacy crises in Thailand, The Pacific Review, Volume 18, Issue 4 December 2005 The monarchy is protected by the severe l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law, even though the people's attitude towards the institution varies from one reign to another."]}, {"page": "SOAS University of London", "response": ["* In academia, SOAS alumni include: Edith Penrose, economics scholar, Simon Digby, oriental scholar, Kusuma Karunaratne, Sri Lankan academic, university administrator, Professor and scholar of Sinhalese language and literature, Wang Gungwu, Australian historian of Asia, Sir Martin Harris, educationalist, Gregory B.

He also noted how, in comparison to the Constitutional Court's 2001 acquittal of Thaksin, the judiciary was a much more important part of the \"network\" than it was in the past.Federico Ferrara, Thailand Unhinged: unraveling the myth of a Thai-style democracy, Equinox Publishing 2010"]}, {"page": "Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u", "response": ["In 1925, Phan arrived in Shanghai on what he thought was a short trip on behalf of his movement. He was to meet with Ho Chi Minh, who at that time used the name Ly Thuy, one of Ho's many aliases. Ho had invited Phan to come to Canton to discuss matters of common interest. Ho was in Canton at the Soviet Embassy, purportedly as a Soviet citizen working as a secretary, translator, and interpreter. In exchange for money, Ho allegedly informed the French police of Phan's imminent arrival.

Ho Chi Minh: Asian Tito? This is disputed by Sophie Quinn-Judge and Duncan McCargo, who point out that this is a legend made up by anti-communist authors, considering that Lam Duc Thu's reports showed that the French already had all the information they needed from their own spies. Also, according to Quinn-Judge and McCargo, Ho was rapidly gaining adherence from the \"best elements\" of Vietnamese Quoc Dan Dang to his ideas, thus having no motivation to eliminate Phan, who considered Ho more like a successor, rather than a competitor. Thus Ho had plenty reasons to support such a respected activist as a figurehead for his movement."]}, {"page": "South Thailand insurgency", "response": ["Although Thailand's southern violence is mostly ethnic-based, anonymous leaflets issued by militant groups often contain jihadist language.

Political scientist Duncan McCargo and other western scholars have posed the question of why conservative Thai scholars have not considered the freedom of religion argument in the case of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Several Thai scholars have pointed out the increasing entanglement of state and religion in Thailand, as the temple has relied heavily on the Supreme Sangha Council's authority in its activities. Since the Sangha Council is part of the Thai government, critics are afraid the influential temple might take over the state. If state and religion were more separated, problems could be more easily solved by the Sangha and other parts of civil society, without any state interference.", "The propagation of the temple has been analyzed from three scholarly approaches. The earliest analyses of the temple were done by Thai (former) monastics and intellectuals, who criticized the temple for the content of its teachings. These scholars described the temple's teachings as \"distorted\" from \"original\" Theravada Buddhism, and depicted the temple as using these teachings for profit and power. Some of the more well-known of these critics are Phra Payutto and Prawase Wasi, who have concluded that the temple cannot be regarded as part of Theravada Buddhism. Religious studies scholar Rachelle Scott and Asian Studies scholar Jesada Buaban have pointed out the modernist perspective in this approach, as it emphasizes a deviation from a rational, idealist and universal Buddhism, that is unaffected by local customs and traditions. The second group of scholars were anthropologists and sociologists, both Thai and non-Thai, who mostly studied the question why the temple had been so effective in its propagation. Most scholars in this group emphasized the popularity of the temple among middle-class Thai from the cities, and the ability of the temple to appeal to middle class attitudes and use modern technology. The third group are scholars who believe that Thailand should become a secular state with no state intervention in religion. These scholars downplay the true Buddhism\u2013false Buddhism dichotomy, and believe that Wat Phra Dhammakaya should be given freedom in propagating its views, as long as they do not infringe on human rights. Some western scholars, such as Duncan McCargo, historian David Streckfuss and legal scholar Mark Templeton, have voiced similar opinions. Furthermore, some prominent secular state proponents have heavily criticized the first group of scholars as inconsistent, as they often rely on the support of the state in their understanding and enforcement of \"true Buddhism\". According to Surapot Thaweesak, they only apply their critical view of \"false Buddhism\" to their political and religious opponents, but not their proponents who support them by political power, usually through undemocratic means."]}, {"page": "Sandbach School", "response": ["*Duncan McCargo, professor of political science at the University of Copenhagen"]}, {"page": "The King Never Smiles", "response": ["In a review in the New Left Review, Duncan McCargo, a lecturer from the University of Leeds who wrote several articles on the \"network monarchy\" of Bhumibol and his proxies, called The King Never Smiles an \"important book,\" that was, \"fluently written and grounded in very considerable research.\"  McCargo said that while Handley's account, \"draws on insights into the Thai monarchy from a range of scholars and writers, including Christine Gray, Kobkua Suwannathat-Pian, and Sukhumbhand Paribatra,\" his narrative, \"moves far beyond the parameters of these precursors. It has a salience and an urgency well beyond that of any ordinary biography...\"  McCargo praised Handley's \"understanding of Bhumibol as a political actor, as the primary architect of a lifelong project to transform an unpopular and marginalized monarchical institution\u2014on the verge of abolition more than once\u2014into the single most powerful component of the modern Thai state.\"  McCargo also praised Handley's \"brilliantly intuitive grasp of the seedy interplay between money and power,\" regarding the workings of the Crown Property Bureau.
