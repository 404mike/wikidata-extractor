By the future time period of Norton, magic is referred to as the Fifth Fundamental Force, with its own primary particle, the Magicon (similar to a graviton).

More subtly, Piers Anthony depicted the Princess Threnody as being cursed by her stepmother in Crewel Lye: A Caustic Yarn: if she ever entered Castle Roogna, it would fall down.

Goldsmith had little previous experience with science fiction, and bought what she liked, rather than trying to conform to a notion of what science fiction should be. The result was the debut of more significant writers in her magazines than anywhere else at that time: she published the first stories of Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, Piers Anthony and Thomas M. Disch, among many others.  Award-winning stories published during Goldsmith's editorship include Zelazny's \"He Who Shapes\", a novella about the use of dream therapy to cure phobias. It was serialized in the January and February 1965 issues, and won a Nebula Award from the newly established Science Fiction Writers of America. Goldsmith often wrote long, helpful letters to her authors: Zelazny commented in a letter to her that \"Most of anything I have learned was stimulated by those first sales, and then I learned, and possibly even learned more, from some of the later rejections\". Disch and Le Guin have also acknowledged the influence Goldsmith had on their early careers`;Ashley, Transformations, pp.\u00a0224\u2013225.

The studio continued to expand their game engine, adapting to the popularity of the mouse and the increased media storage of the compact disc. The first project to take advantage of CD-ROM technology was Companions of Xanth, which signaled Legend's shift from traditional text adventures to a point-and-click interface.
