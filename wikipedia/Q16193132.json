Truly he was right...I usually avoid answering by referring to those I enjoy meeting the most and those that impress me the most. Until yesterday my preferred answer was to refer to Sayyed Mohamad Hussein Fadlullah. When you visited him you could be sure of a real debate, a respectful argument and you knew you would leave his presence feeling a better person. That for me is the real effect of a true man of religion; leaving an impact on everyone he meets, no matter what their faith...Lebanon is a lesser place the day after but his absence will be felt well beyond Lebanon's shores. If I was sad to hear the news I know other peoples' lives will be truly blighted. The world needs more men like him willing to reach out across faiths, acknowledging the reality of the modern world and daring to confront old constraints.\" The UK foreign office said it had taken down the message after \"mature consideration.\" They also added that \"the ambassador expressed a personal view on Shiekh Sayyid Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah describing the man as she knew him. We welcomed his progressive views on women's rights and interfaith dialogue but there were also areas where we had profound disagreements, especially over his statements advocating attacks on Israel.\""]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Lebanon", "response": ["*2006\u20132011: Frances Guy"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Yemen", "response": ["*2001\u20132004: Frances Guy"]}, {"page": "Guy (surname)", "response": ["*Frances Guy (born 1959) British former ambassador, UN Women's representative in Iraq"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at George Watson's College", "response": ["* Frances Guy Diplomat (British Ambassador to the Yemen and Lebanon)"]}]}}
