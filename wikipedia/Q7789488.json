He was the third of eight surviving children of Sir William Fairbairn (1789\u20131874).  His father was a Scottish engineer who moved to Manchester in the early 19th century, where he designed bridges, and established a business, William Fairbairn & Sons, that was involved in iron founding, boilermaking, ship building, and manufacturing steam locomotives.  He was a nephew of Peter Fairbairn of Leeds - also an engineer like his brother - and first cousin of MP Andrew Fairbairn.\nAfter a private education, Thomas Fairbairn worked in his father's businesses from 1840, and took charge of the firm's shipbuilding operation in Millwall.  After a tour of Italy in 1841\u20132, he started to use his industrial wealth to collect paintings.\nHe married Allison Callaway on 23 March 1848 and settled back in Manchester.  They had at least five children together.  Two\u2014his son Arthur and daughter Constance\u2014were born deaf.\nFairbairn was impressed by the works of William Holman Hunt exhibited at the 1853 Royal Academy exhibition, and commissioned Hunt to complete his 1853 painting The Awakening Conscience, although he asked Hunt to repaint the expression of the female figure.  He also persuaded Hunt to make changes to his 1854 painting The Scapegoat.   Fairbairn commissioned a group portrait of his wife and five children from Hunt in 1864, which became his The Children's Holiday.  Although he acquired portraits from Hunt, Fairbairn generally preferred Pre-Raphaelite landscapes and historical painting.  He commissioned paintings by Edward Lear, and sculptures by Thomas Woolner, including a life-sized marble sculpture of his two deaf children in 1857\u20131862.\nFairburn was a commissioner of the 1851 Great Exhibition, and chairman of the Executive Committee that organised the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, selecting the firm that built the temporary exhibition building, C. D. Young & Co, who were already building the Museum of Science and Art in South Kensington (later the Victoria and Albert Museum).  His friend Augustus Egg was appointed as director of the gallery of Modern Masters at the exhibition, with many of Fairburn's favourite Pre-Raphaelites being selected.  He was responsible for the decision to purchase Jules Soulages's collection for \u00a313,500, to form the core of the collection of medieval and Renaissance decorative arts.  It was later sold in instalments to the V&A.  Fairbairn was offered a knighthood for his efforts, but declined.\nFairbairn worked on the International Exhibitions of 1862, 1867 and 1871.  From 1860, he struggled with a project to open a new, free new art gallery for Manchester, which finally opened as the City Art Gallery in 1882.  He was elected to the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 in May 1861.  In around 1862, he moved to Burton Park, near Petworth in Sussex, but moved to Brambridge House, in Bishopstoke near Southampton, by 1866.  He was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1870 and succeeded his father as 2nd Baronet in 1874.\nMany of his pictures were auctioned off in the 1890s, and the remainder of the collection was broken up after his death from a stroke.  He died in Bishopstoke, in Hampshire, and was buried at Twyford church.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Waterhouse", "response": ["St Mary's Church of England parish church in Twyford, Hampshire (1876\u201378) is a village church it replaced the previous dilapidated medieval church.

Around 1869, the builders discovered that they didn't have the technical knowledge to build the domed roof, meaning that Thomas Fairbairn Engineering Co. Ltd. of Manchester had to be contracted to provide a prefabricated dome within a few weeks; this gave the Library of Parliament the distinction of being the first building in North America to have a state-of-the-art wrought iron roof. Further, in 1883, the library's 300 gas lights were converted to electricity. However, such additional costs brought the library's price to $301,812, a sum added on top of the total cost for all the parliament buildings, which had already gone far above the original allotted budget. Within only 12 years, the entire roof was stripped of its slate shingles in a tornado that hit Parliament Hill in 1888, since then the roof has been clad in copper."]}, {"page": "The Awakening Conscience", "response": ["The look on the girl's face in the modern painting is not the look of pain and horror that viewers saw when the painting was first exhibited, and which shocked and repulsed many of the contemporary critics. The painting was commissioned by Thomas Fairbairn, a Manchester industrialist and patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, after Egg discussed Hunt's ideas and possibly showed him some of the initial sketches.Tate, Illustrated Companion. Fairbairn paid Hunt 350 guineas. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1854, along with The Light of the World.  Fairbairn found himself unable to bear looking on the woman's expression day-to-day, so persuaded Hunt to soften it.  Hunt started work but fell ill and allowed the painting to be returned to Fairbairn for display at the Birmingham Society of Artists exhibition in 1856 before he was completely happy with the result. Later he was able to work on it again and confided to Edward Lear that he thought he had \"materially bettered it\". As noted in the spandrels, Hunt retouched the painting in 1864 and again in 1886 when he repaired some work that had been carried out by a restorer in the interim."]}, {"page": "Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857", "response": ["The idea for an exhibition in Manchester was first expressed in a letter sent on 10 February 1856 by John Connellan Deane, son of Irish architect Sir Thomas Deane and a commissioner for the 1853 Dublin Exhibition, to Thomas Fairbairn son of Manchester iron founder Sir William Fairbairn and a commissioner for the 1851 Great Exhibition. The concept quickly gained momentum: after an initial meeting on 26 March 1856, a guarantee fund of \u00a374,000 was soon underwritten by around 100 contributors, and Queen Victoria and Prince Albert granted their patronage."]}, {"page": "Thomas Fairbairn, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["#redirectThomas Fairbairn"]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Fairbairn, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["#redirectThomas Fairbairn"]}, {"page": "Thomas Fairbairn (disambiguation)", "response": ["Thomas Fairbairn was an art collector.", "Thomas Fairbairn may also refer to:"]}, {"page": "List of ecclesiastical works by Alfred Waterhouse", "response": ["|Constructed in knapped flint with red brick bands, stone dressings, and tiled roofs.
