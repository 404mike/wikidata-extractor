He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget... I think it was arguably \u00a31m under from when they had got promoted from that league the time previously\".

It was to be his only goal of the campaign, making 36 appearances in a season where he was in and out of the first-team due to facing tough competition from fellow central defender Antony Kay. His second year at Tranmere saw Chorley become an integral part of the side, playing in 45 of the 46 league matches, as well as making a further eight appearances in cup competitions. During the season, Chorley doubled his goal tally for the club, scoring in a 2\u20131 loss to Hartlepool United at Victoria Park in March 2009.
