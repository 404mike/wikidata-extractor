It was formed around John Duncan Fergusson after his return to Glasgow in 1939. It had its origins in the New Art Club formed in 1940, and had its first exhibition in 1942. Members did not have a common style, but shared left-wing views and were influenced by contemporary continental art. Members included Donald Bain, William Crosbie, Marie de Banzie and Isabel Babianska. Tom MacDonald, Bet Low and William Senior formed the Clyde Group to pursue political painting that manifested in urban industrial landscapes. The group helped start the careers of a generation of Glasgow-based artists and was part of a wider cultural \"golden age\" for the city.", "The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists strongly influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904\u201379), whose work was often crowded with rich colour and heavily worked paint, as in his The Striped Vase (1943), which was influenced by expressionism. William Crosbie (1915\u201399) was strongly influenced by surrealism, which can be seen in his Heart Knife (1934), an early example of a Scottish artist using the semi-abstract style derived from cubism.\"William Crosbie, Heart Knife, 1934, National Galleries Scotland. Retrieved 16 April 2014. Margaret Oliver Brown (1912\u201390) was known for her portraiture.A. Strang, Modern Scottish Women: Painters and Sculptors 1885\u20131965 (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 2015), , p. 40. Marie de Banzie (1918\u201390) was influenced by expressionism and particularity the post-expressionist work of Gauguin, as can be seen in her 1945 painting Shadow, which borrows from his Haitian pictures. Isabel Brodie Babianska (1920\u20132006), who had trained with de Banzie at the Glasgow School of Art, was influenced by expressionist Cha\u00efm Soutine, as can be seen in the collection of grotesque faces in her painting Fiesta (1943). Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900\u201388), in dislocated landscapes such as October (1946) and Turning Hay, which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of Van Gogh. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees Josef Herman (1911\u20132000), resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943D.

Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914\u201385) and Bet Low (1924\u20132007), who with painter William Senior (b. 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art.
