He also played for Scotland in six full internationals between 2002 and 2006. His versatility meant that he was deployed in a variety of roles in his career, including centre back, full back and midfielder. Murray stated that he preferred to play at centre back or central midfield.Murray started his career with Hibs, and captained the club during the 2004\u201305 season. Murray signed for Rangers under freedom of contract in 2005, but he was troubled with injuries during his time at Ibrox club and was eventually diagnosed with a form of arthritis. He was released by Rangers in August 2007 and signed for Norwich City, but fell out of favour there after a managerial change. He returned to Hibs in January 2008, and was made vice captain of the team in July 2009.Murray left Hibs in May 2012 and was appointed player/manager of Dumbarton later that year. After two-and-a-half years in charge of Dumbarton, Murray was appointed manager of St Mirren on 22 May 2015. He resigned from this position in December 2015.
