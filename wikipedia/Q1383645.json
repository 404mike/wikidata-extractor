After some material had been written, auditions for a new keyboardist began which involved about eight players, including Jean Roussel, Nick Glennie-Smith of Wally, and Greek musician and composer Vangelis. Others were flown in from the US and Germany. Anderson had become a fan of Vangelis and visited his Paris flat when Yes were in town performing Tales from Topographic Oceans. Vangelis agreed to an audition, but Yes found he was non-committal to the role and too strong a personality for a group. Phil Carson, an Atlantic Records manager and associate of the band, said that Vangelis \"tried out Yes but it didn't really gel ... Vangelis wouldn't get on a plane and wouldn't fly anywhere and Yes were about to go on tour.\" The possibility of Vangelis joining the band was also affected by a rejection from the Musicians Union. Soon after, Melody Maker reporter and band biographer Chris Welch suggested that the band try Patrick Moraz, a Swiss musician and film composer with a background in jazz and classical music, and a member of the progressive and jazz fusion trio Refugee. Less than a week later, Moraz accepted an invitation from Brian Lane, the band's manager, to an audition. Moraz was a fan of the band and had previously met them during their tour of Switzerland in 1969."]}, {"page": "List of musicals: A to L", "response": ["| Nick Glennie-Smith"]}, {"page": "The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne", "response": ["The series' main theme and incidental music was composed by Nick Glennie-Smith.
