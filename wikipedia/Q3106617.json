B. Priestley, was extolling it as an exemplar of English humour; Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: \"[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart\".Priestley, p. 116 In a 1943 essay, George Orwell considered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who \"constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly\".Orwell, p. 787 In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high; Osbert Lancaster deemed it \"a great work of art\", and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians. Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought the Diary \"the best comic novel in the language\", and lauded Pooter as \"the presiding shade\" of his era. This accolade was echoed a further generation on by A. N. Wilson, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: \"Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [1890s] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?\"Wilson 2003, p. 545 Wilson also observed the extent to which the Pooters had become recognised as \"arbiters of the greatest good taste\", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted \"period\" homes.Wilson 1989, p. 8 A Spectator article of 2008 remarks on how such houses as \"The Laurels\", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable \u00a31 million-plus homes in what it terms \"banker land\"."]}, {"page": "George Gissing", "response": ["*Gillian Tindall (1974).
