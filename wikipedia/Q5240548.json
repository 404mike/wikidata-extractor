His appointment came at a significant time for the retailer; Sir Peter Davis had been forced out as chairman by shareholders due to an extremely generous bonus package despite his dubious performance as chairman and previously as CEO, another shareholder revolt in February 2004 had caused the company to abandon the appointment of Sir Ian Prosser as chairman and Justin King had been appointed chief executive in March 2004.
