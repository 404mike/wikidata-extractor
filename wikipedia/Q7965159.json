The church was rebuilt twice, after a fire in the 14th century, and again in the 19th century. Walter Farquhar Hook, Vicar of Leeds from 1837 until preferment as Dean of Chichester in 1859 was responsible for the construction of the present building, and of the revitalisation of the Anglican church throughout Leeds as a whole. The architect was Robert Dennis Chantrell. ", "* Walter Farquhar Hook D.D. 1837 (formerly vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Coventry, later Dean of Chichester Cathedral)"]}]}}
