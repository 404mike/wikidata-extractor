He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson after they had met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.", "In February 2012 it was reported that Aston had left Time Team. He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been \"dumbed down\", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists\u2014including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus\u2014had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained \"a lot of faffing about.\" In an interview with the magazine British Archaeology Aston said: \"The time had come to leave.
