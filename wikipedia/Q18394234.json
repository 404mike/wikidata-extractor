In the absence of any general agreement for the Liberal Union to not contest National Party/Progressive Country seats, the National Party were soundly defeated by their former coalition partner. Five incumbent MPs contested the election under the Progressive Country Party banner: Peter Reidy (Victoria), Edward Alfred Anstey and William David Ponder (North Adelaide), Frederick Coneybeer (East Torrens) and Thomas Hyland Smeaton (Sturt). Former MP John Vaughan also contested Sturt. Of those five, only Reidy survived, having personally arranged with the Liberal Union to be unopposed. William Humphrey Harvey, who had not been up for re-election, remained as the sole survivor of the party in the Legislative Council, but he subsequently joined the Liberal Union in July 1921. The party was again being referred to as the National Party when it merged with the Liberal Union to create the Liberal Federation in October 1923."]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1918\u20131921", "response": ["|| Thomas Hyland Smeaton || National ||  Sturt || 1905\u20131921"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1915\u20131918", "response": ["|| Thomas Hyland Smeaton ||Labor/National  ||  Sturt || 1905\u20131921"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1912\u20131915", "response": ["|| Thomas Hyland Smeaton || Labor ||  Torrens || 1905\u20131921"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1910\u20131912", "response": ["|| Thomas Hyland Smeaton || Labor ||  Torrens || 1905\u20131921"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1906\u20131910", "response": ["|| Thomas Hyland Smeaton || Labor ||  Torrens || 1905\u20131921"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1905\u20131906", "response": ["|| Thomas Hyland Smeaton || Labor ||  Torrens || 1905\u20131921"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1921 South Australian state election", "response": ["|Sturt (3) || T.
