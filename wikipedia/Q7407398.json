He was left out of the opening match, a 42\u20133 win over Samoa, before starting at full-back in the 26\u201321 win over Scotland four days later. He was named on the bench for the final pool match against Argentina, and came on for Hallam Amos in the 59th minute as Wales won 25\u201320 to top the group and qualify for the semi-finals. Williams again started at full-back in the semi-final against defending champions South Africa, and played a part in both of Wales' tries; for the first, a deft pass allowed captain Ellis Jenkins to crash over and give Wales an 11\u20137 lead. South Africa replied almost immediately, and had a six-point lead going into the final minute, when Williams broke four tackles to put Wales in good field position for Sam Davies to set up a try for wing Ashley Evans, which Davies then converted to give Wales an 18\u201317 win. Williams was again picked at full-back for the final against England on 23 June, but England won the match and the title.
