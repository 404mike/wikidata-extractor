After graduating from university in 1996, she worked as a DJ as well as co-founder of record label Marine Parade in Brighton. By 2002 she was focused heavily on writing and singing her own songs, collaborating with various producers in the United States such as Guy Sigsworth, Yoad Nevo, and Ge-Ology to help create what would become her debut studio album: Finally Woken, released on 24 March 2004 through ATO Records. Popularised by singles \"They\", \"Just a Ride\" and \"Wish I\", the album garnered generous sales and chart performance in the United States, Canada, Japan and Europe. Jem followed up her successful debut with her second album, Down to Earth, released on 18 September 2008.

Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that \"in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself.\" The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate on the things that did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track \"Mother and Father\". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was \"a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on.\" According to Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, another concept of American Life was about \"nothingness\". This was evident in the titles of the songs like \"Nobody Knows Me\", usage of \"no\" in \"Love Profusion\", as well as \"Nothing Fails\". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But \"Nothing Fails\", along with tracks \"Intervention\" and \"X-Static Process,\" became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, \"Nothing Fails\" also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired \"Intervention\" and \"X-Static Process,\" both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track \"Easy Ride,\" which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.", "*Jem Griffiths \u2013 songwriter"]}, {"page": "Finally Woken", "response": ["Finally Woken is the debut studio album by Welsh singer-songwriter Jem, released initially in the United States on 23 March 2004, with ATO Records.", "*Jem Griffiths\u00a0\u2013 vocals, executive production", "Category:Jem (singer) albums"]}, {"page": "Closer (2004 film)", "response": ["The main theme of the film follows Mozart's opera Cos\u00ec fan tutte, with references to that opera in both the plot and the soundtrack.
