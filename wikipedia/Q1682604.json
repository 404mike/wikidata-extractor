After being given the script by her agent, Jones read it in its entirety in one sitting, and said that she enjoyed that it was a \"love story and not a straightforward biopic.\" She auditioned for the film and its director, James Marsh, offered the part immediately after, surprising Jones who was accustomed to waiting several weeks for a confirmation. Jones was aided by Jane Hawking in preparing for the role, meeting with her. The film has been praised largely due to her and Redmayne's performances. Jane Hawking was so impressed by the portrayal she wondered if it was herself when watching Jones. For her role as Jane, she received widespread acclaim from a number of organisations, including nominations for an Academy Award for Best Actress, a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, a Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role."]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay", "response": ["| Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Wilde Hawking"]}, {"page": "Satellite Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture", "response": ["| Felicity Jones || The Theory of Everything || Jane Wilde Hawking "]}]}}
