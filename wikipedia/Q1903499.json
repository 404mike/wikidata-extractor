The initial work by Martin Bott suggested that the batholith had an overall trapezoidal shape with a base to the batholith at about 10\u201312\u00a0km. However, current understanding of granite pluton shape suggest that most are either laccolithic or lopolithic. Comparisons with other examples would suggest that the thicknesses of the individual plutons would be in the range 3\u20135\u00a0km, based on their outcrop widths. The volume of the batholith was estimated in 1989 to be around 68,000 cubic kilometres.Selwood et al., p.\u00a0120"]}, {"page": "North Pennine Batholith", "response": ["The North Pennine Batholith, also known as the Weardale Granite is a granitic batholith lying under northeast England, emplaced around 400 million years ago in the early Devonian.Kimbell, G.S., B.
