Her research into the efficacy of light therapy and the epidemiology of puerperal sepsis provided the first evidence-based evaluations of these subjects.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Light therapy", "response": ["From the late nineteenth century until the early 1930s, light therapy was considered an effective and mainstream medical therapy in the UK for conditions such as varicose ulcer, 'sickly children' and a wide range of other conditions.  Controlled trials by the medical scientist Dora Colebrook, supported by the Medical Research Council, indicated that light therapy was not effective for such a wide range of conditions."]}, {"page": "Shiranee Sriskandan", "response": ["Every year, 616 million cases of pharyngitis are caused by the bacteria streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium can cause a range of diseases, from sepsis, to skin infections and pharyngitis. Unfortunately, 1 in 5 patients who have an invasive Group A streptococcal infections die. The complications can include rheumatic fever, toxic shock syndrome and valvular heart disease. Sriskandan created a new asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage model that can help people better understand streptococcal infection. The dosing and analysis of the model were analysed using a novel imaging technique; bioluminescent bacteria. She has demonstrated that bioluminescence can be used for the longitudinal imaging of bacterial infection in mice, which can increase the time mice can be used for investigations and reduce the need to cull animals between experiments. Each mouse can serve as its own experimental control, which improves the quality of the research, and bioluminescence imaging data can be used to quantify the dosage of a particular bacteria. Alongside her fundamental scientific research, Sriskandan has documented the stories of the first people to study Group A streptococcal infections \u2013 including Dora Colebrook."]}]}}
