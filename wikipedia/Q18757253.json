In particular, the \"Shield of Achilles\" project began with William Theed the elder, who died in 1817; and then passed to John Flaxman. The chasing itself was carried out by William Pitts II. Bigge presented a \"Shield\" to the Royal Society of Literature in 1849, with a portrait of Flaxman. The firm made a new crown for Queen Victoria, less than half the weight of the one made for George IV."]}, {"page": "Yellow Drawing Room", "response": ["Charles Knight's 1843 guide to London described the room as the \"most superb of the whole\" of the rooms on the floor and noted that it was decorated with full length portraits of the royal family painted on panels. The Illustrated London News described the room as \"the most superb of the entire range of rooms\" of the western front of the palace in 1844, and likened its appearance to the drawing room of the Reform Club on Pall Mall. Sculptural reliefs by William Pitts were a feature of the room in the 1840s. A series of twelve reliefs on the \"origin and progress of pleasure\" decorated the room. The individual reliefs have been described in sequence as depicting; Love Awakening the Soul to Pleasure, the Soul in the Bower of Fancy, the Pleasure of Decoration, the Invention of Music, the Pleasure of Music, the Dance, the Masquerade, the Drama, the contest for the Palm, the Palm resigned, the Struggle for the Laurel and the Laurel obtained. The Illustrated London News regretted the addition of medallion portraits of royal family members that broke up the frieze."]}]}}
