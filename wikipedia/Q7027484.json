The term was coined by Nick Lowe.In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.", "A plot voucher, as defined by Nick Lowe, is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object.
