He illustrated numerous science fiction book and magazine covers, some under the pseudonym S. Fantoni, and provided interior illustrations for books and magazines. Jones was active in the field from 1953 to 1985, and reprints of his artwork continued to appear on book covers until his death in 1999.\nIn 1969, he became the art editor for Vision of Tomorrow, a short-lived British SF magazine. Although probably best known for his Star Trek covers for Bantam Books and almost fifty covers for Sphere Books, much of his output was for German publishers, including more than 100 covers for Bastei L\u00fcbbe's science fiction imprint and over 500 for Terra Astra magazine.The Science Fiction Writers of America described Jones as \"the precursor to a generation of artists that helped define the look of early '70s SF illustration\". He was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist in 1970 and 1971. In Larry Niven's short story \"Singularities Make Me Nervous\", from Convergent Series, the protagonist, speaking in the future, describes his apartment as containing \"Eddie Jones originals\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science fiction and fantasy artists", "response": ["*Eddie Jones (1935\u20131999)"]}, {"page": "List of Worldcons", "response": ["| Jack Gaughan (pro)Eddie Jones (fan)"]}, {"page": "Edward Jones", "response": ["* Guitar Slim (Eddie Jones, 1926\u20131959), American guitarist", "* Eddie Jones (jazz musician) (1929\u20131997), American double bassist", "* Eddie Jones (actor) (1934\u20132019), American actor", "* Eddie Jones (artist) (1935\u20131999), British SF artist and illustrator", "* Eddie Jones (American football executive) (1938\u20132012), former General Manager and President of the Miami Dolphins", "* Eddie Jones (rugby union) (born 1960), Head coach of the national teams of Australia, Japan and England", "* Eddie Jones (footballer, born 1914) (1914\u20131984), Welsh footballer for Bolton Wanderers and Swindon Town", "* Eddie Jones (footballer, born 1952), English former professional footballer", "* Eddie Jones (basketball) (born 1971), American former basketball player", "* Eddie Jones (linebacker) (born 1988), defensive lineman at the University of Texas"]}, {"page": "Richard A.
