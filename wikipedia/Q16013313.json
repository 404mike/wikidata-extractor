He appeared in an episode of Jim Henson's television series The Storyteller, \"The Heartless Giant\", and in two films, Paperhouse (1988) and Taxandria (1994).\nTaxandria was filmed in 1989, but was not released until 1994 due to lengthy post-production. During that period, Spiers suffered a negative reaction to an anti-malaria medication that left him gravely ill. He never recovered, and died at the Royal Free Hospital in London in 1994, prior to Taxandria's release. The film was dedicated to his memory at the screening in autumn 1994 in the Flanders Film Festival.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1988 in film", "response": ["*Paperhouse, directed by Bernard Rose, starring Ben Cross, Glenne Headly and Elliott Spiers (U.K.)"]}, {"page": "The Jim Henson Hour", "response": ["* Elliott Spiers as Prince Leo"]}, {"page": "The StoryTeller (TV series)", "response": ["This episode stars Elliott Spiers as Prince Leo, Nicholas Selby as the King, Peter Marinker as the voice of the wolf, and Frederick Warder as the giant.

The people are not happy living only in the present; it is repressive. Soon he sees that many suffer from extreme paranoia. Aim\u00e9 (Elliott Spiers), the son of the evil Head of Police, seems to be a catalyst for change in Taxandria, as he is obsessed with making new inventions and learning about the country's past. Later, Aim\u00e9 falls in love with Princess Ail\u00e9e who is trying to free herself from the paradisaical confines of the Garden of Mirth, where women are kept away from men, and discovers the secret of his father that made him Taxandria's effective ruler while being the Head of Police, as well as the true nature of the Two Princes.", "Taxandria was filmed in Budapest in 1989. However, due to the enormous amount of post-production work that needed to be completed, it was not released until October 1994. In the interim, Elliott Spiers, who portrayed Aim\u00e9 Perel in the film, became gravely ill from the side-effects of an anti-malaria inoculation. As a result, he was unable to complete the voice-dubbing required for his character and, consequently, the voice of Aim\u00e9 Perel is that of another actor. Spiers died in January 1994, before the film's release. Taxandria was premiered at the 1994 Flanders Film Festival and was dedicated to his memory."]}, {"page": "List of adventure films of the 1990s", "response": ["|Taxandria||Raoul Servais|| Armin Mueller-Stahl, Richard Kattan, Elliott Spiers, Katja Studt ||BelgiumGermanyFranceNetherlandsHungary||Fantasy adventure"]}, {"page": "Hampstead Cemetery", "response": ["*Elliott Spiers, actor (played the role of \"Marc\" in the 1988 film Paperhouse)"]}]}}
