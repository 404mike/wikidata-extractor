Two weeks later, on 16 February, he scored once again, poking in from close range to restore Mansfield's lead in a victory over Cambridge United. Jones' sixth of the season came when he headed in James Jennings' centre to give the club an important 2\u20131 away win against Woking on 6 March 2013. He scored the only goal of the game on the hour mark in Mansfield's 1\u20130 away win at Tamworth on 30 March, subsequently earning Mansfield a club record eleventh consecutive victory, as the run propelled them to the top of the Conference National table. He added one final goal to his tally in what was a goalscoring season for the defender, his eighth of the campaign coming in a 3\u20131 home win against Macclesfield Town, a win that moved Mansfield two points clear at the top with just three games remaining.
