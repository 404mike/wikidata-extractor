In 1920, tired of the lecture circuit, Shackleton began to consider the possibility of a last expedition. He thought seriously of going to the Beaufort Sea area of the Arctic, a largely unexplored region, and raised some interest in this idea from the Canadian government. With funds supplied by former schoolfriend John Quiller Rowett, he acquired a 125-ton Norwegian sealer, named Foca I, which he renamed ."]}, {"page": "John Boyd Orr", "response": ["When Boyd Orr returned to Aberdeen in early 1919, his plan for a larger Institute had still not been accepted. Indeed, even his plans for the annual maintenance grant had to be approved by the Professor of Agriculture in Cambridge, Thomas Barlow Wood. Despite gaining the latter's support, his expansion plans were at first rebuffed, although he succeeded in having the annual grant increased to \u00a34,000. In 1920 he was introduced to John Quiller Rowett, a businessman who seemed to have qualms of conscience over the large profits he had made during the war. Shortly afterwards, the government agreed to finance half the cost of Boyd Orr's plan, provided he could raise the other half elsewhere. Rowett agreed to provide \u00a310,000 for the first year, \u00a310,000 for the second year, and gave an additional \u00a32,000 for the purchase of a farm, provided that, \"if any work done at the Institute on animal nutrition was found to have a bearing on human nutrition, the Institute would be allowed to follow up this work\", a condition the Treasury was willing to accept. By September 1922 the buildings were nearly completed, and the renamed Rowett Research Institute was opened shortly thereafter by Queen Mary."]}, {"page": "Voyage of the James Caird", "response": ["Later that year John Quiller Rowett, who had financed this last expedition and was a former school friend of Shackleton's from Dulwich College, South London, decided to present the James Caird to the college. It remained there until 1967, although its display building was severely damaged by bombs in 1944."]}, {"page": "Rowett Island (South Shetland Islands)", "response": ["Rowett Island is a rocky island  long, lying immediately off Cape Lookout, Elephant Island, in the South Shetland Islands. Rowett Island is located at . Rowett Island was known to both American and British sealers as early as 1822. Rowett Island was named by members of a British expedition (1921-1922) under Ernest Shackleton for John Quiller Rowett, chief patron of the expedition."]}, {"page": "Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition", "response": ["The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia.", "Later that year, Shackleton met by chance an old school-friend, John Quiller Rowett, who agreed to put up a nucleus of cash to get Shackleton started. With this money, in January 1921, Shackleton purchased the wooden Norwegian whaler Foca I together with other equipment, and began the process of hiring of a crew."]}, {"page": "The Rowett Institute", "response": ["At the breakout of the Great War, Orr left the Institute, but returned in 1919 with a staff of four to begin work in the new laboratory. Orr continued to push for a new research institute and finally the Government agreed to pay half the costs but stipulated that the other half was to be found from other sources. The extra money was donated by Dr John Quiller Rowett, a businessman and director of a wine and spirits merchants in London."]}, {"page": "Sir John Stewart, 1st Baronet, of Fingask", "response": ["On 1 October 1924, one of Stewart's creditors, John Quiller Rowett, to whom he owed nearly \u00a3100,000, hanged himself in his London home.\"Mr. J.

Clarke coined the binomial name Nesospiza goughensis.  The Gough finch is now the only species placed in the genus Rowettia that was introduced in 1923 by the English ornithologist Percy Lowe. The genus name was chosen to honour John Quiller Rowett, an English businessman and the sponsor of the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition. The Gough finch was traditionally considered to be a bunting in the family Emberizidae, but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that it is a member of the subfamily Diglossinae in the tanager family Thraupidae and is sister to a clade containing birds in the genus Melanodera. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised."]}, {"page": "Quest (ship)", "response": ["Quest was originally built in Ris\u00f8r, Norway in 1917 as the wooden-hulled sealer Foca I or Foca II. She was the polar expedition vessel of the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition of 1921\u20131922.  The vessel was renamed Quest by Lady Emily Shackleton, wife of expedition leader Ernest Shackleton.  At the expense of expedition financier John Quiller Rowett, Quest was refitted for the expedition with modifications overseen by sailing master Frank Worsley, including re-rigging and the addition of a deckhouse.  Shackleton was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, and so for this voyage Quest bore the RYS suffix and flew the White Ensign."]}, {"page": "Quiller (disambiguation)", "response": ["*John Quiller Rowett (1874\u20131924), British businessman in the spirits industry"]}, {"page": "Rowett", "response": ["*John Quiller Rowett (1874\u20131924), British businessman in the spirits industry"]}]}}
