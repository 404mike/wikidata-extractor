Carver's batting style is unknown, though it is known he was a fast-medium bowler, though which he arm he bowled with is also unknown. He was born at Thames Ditton, Surrey.\nCarver made a single first-class appearance for Surrey against Gloucestershire in the 1907 County Championship at the Ashley Down Ground, Bristol. Surrey won the toss and elected to bat, making 189 all out, with Carver scoring 36 runs before he was dismissed by Francis Roberts. Gloucestershire responded in their first-innings by making 404 all out, with Carver taking a single wicket, that of Percy Mills, to finish with figures of 1/42 from eighteen overs. Surrey were then dismissed for 171 in their second-innings, with Carver being dismissed by Henry Huggins for a duck. Gloucestershire won the match by an innings and 44 runs. This was his only major appearance for Surrey.\nHe died at Bootle, Lancashire, on 1 October 1912.

When he identified himself as \"Carver's George\", as he had done his whole life, she replied that from now on his name was \"George Carver\".
