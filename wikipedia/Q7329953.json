There was witness evidence of a blood-stained glove found in Parry's car on the night of the murder, when he took his car to the garage for cleaning. The evidence from the man who cleaned the car was suppressed by the police at the time. Wilkes argues that there was, moreover, no motive or reason for Wallace to kill his own wife, and that he was charged because the immense publicity surrounding the case impelled the police to get a conviction at any cost. Parry died in 1980 without admitting any involvement in the crime. However, when Goodman and his friend Richard Whittington-Egan confronted him on his London doorstep in 1966, Parry displayed an astonishingly detailed knowledge of the case, and was aware of the deaths of several obscure witnesses connected with it. He also boasted that he would never talk about it, \"not if you were to offer me \u00a32,000\"Jonathan Goodman, The Killing of Julia Wallace, 1987, Harrap, p. 303, .

Cremers told Aleister Crowley that Stephenson was a doctor and had committed the Whitechapel murders as part of a magic ritual and that the sites of the murders, when joined together on a map, formed a calvary cross (which is untrue). The suspicion was not merely caused by Stephenson's preoccupation with \"black magic\". He had been, by his own account, in love with a prostitute, and had contracted venereal disease from others. The fact that Stephenson's wife seemingly disappeared in 1886 has led to the otherwise unsupported speculation that he may have killed her.The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 446, Ed. Maxim Jakubowski and Nathan Braund. According to Jakubowski and Braund, Stephenson claimed to have killed others, and that he was keeping ties stained with human blood, as well as being the owner of candles made from human fat.The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 449, Ed. Maxim Jakubowski and Nathan Braun. Collins and Cremers' theory was later resurrected by Richard Whittington-Egan in A Casebook on Jack the Ripper and subsequently developed by the author Melvin Harris in Jack the Ripper: The Bloody Truth and its two sequels. Crime writer Colin Wilson praised the research done by Harris but concluded it didn't prove any connection between Stephenson and Jack the Ripper.Colin Wilson, \"A Lifetime in Ripperology\", in The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 421, Ed. Maxim Jakubowski and Nathan Braund. Jakubowski and Braund state that the major problem with Stephenson as a suspect is that the idea is heavily reliant on his own testimony, both as to \"the depth of his heartlessness and iniquity and as to his activities\". Whilst Cremers, the principal witness, was closely linked to Aleister Crowley and Stephenson's \"air of mystery and his somewhat theatrical, throwaway boast of wickedness\" seem to anticipate Crowley's own romancing, the statements about blood and candles may have been theatrical props specifically designed to have the effect which they had \u2013 to frighten two impressionable women.The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 449, Ed. Maxim Jakubowski and Nathan Braund. Author Ivor Edwards also named Stephenson as the Ripper in his book Jack the Ripper's Black Magic Rituals published by Penny Publishing (2001) and Blake Publishing (2002).
