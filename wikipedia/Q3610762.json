As before Menin road, bombardment and counter-battery fire began immediately, with practice barrages fired daily as a minimum. Artillery from the VIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston) and IX Corps (Lieutenant General Alexander Hamilton-Gordon) in the south conducted bombardments to simulate attack preparations on Zandvoorde and Warneton.

Its units retained the same role, acting as regiments' third battalions in the provision of a reserve for the regular battalions, but no effort was made to recruit into it, other than in Northern Ireland where they provided the only auxiliary force. Militia battalions existed on paper until they were disbanded in April 1953. In 1924 the Special Reserve/Militia's function was absorbed by the Supplementary Reserve, which was tasked with providing the regular army with specialist technical support in times of crisis.Beckett 2008 p. 97"]}, {"page": "Alexander Hamilton (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (British Army officer, born 1817) (1817\u20131890), soldier and MP", "* Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (British Army officer, born 1859) (1859\u20131939), soldier, son of the above"]}, {"page": "Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (1859-1939)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (British Army officer, born 1859)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (1859\u20131939)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (British Army officer, born 1859)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (general)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (British Army officer, born 1859)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (British Army lieutenant-general)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (British Army officer, born 1859)"]}, {"page": "Action on the Polderhoek Spur", "response": ["General Sir Henry Rawlinson took over command of the Second Army on 8 November.

An attack on Polderhoek Spur and Gheluvelt village, to add depth to the British defensive positions, was mooted but the plan was reduced to the occupation of Polderhoek Spur. It was intended to occupy the low, east-running ridge to deny German artillery-observers a view over the area between Cameron Covert, Reutel and Polygon Wood to the north and the Menin road to the south-west. An advance down the slope of  on a  front would deprive the Germans of the commanding view to the north.

The only purpose military authorities could find for the Territorial Force was to reinforce the army in medium-scale conflicts within the empire. Accordingly, the War Office recommended in March 1919 that the force should be liable for service overseas, a condition of service that territorial representatives recognised as necessary.Dennis pp. 38, 42 It was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921 and renamed in October as the Territorial Army.
