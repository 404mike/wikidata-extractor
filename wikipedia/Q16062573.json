William Harris Rule who was a Methodist missionary and his wife had been allowed to start schools for the children of the forces and the following year he had a reasonable number of pupils. These new schools were very popular particularly with the better off who wanted to avoid the poor quality education supplied by public subscription. The whole matter came to a head on the centenary of the Wesleyan Foundation in 1839 when Gibraltarians were surprised to see 400 local school children marching down Main Street carrying banners. It was apparent that Rule was training missionaries and this was the start of the end of his Methodist academies."]}, {"page": "Education in Gibraltar", "response": ["The regrowth of the schools can be assigned to Mary Ann Rule who was the wife of William Harris Rule a newly arrived Methodist missionary in Gibraltar. They had both learnt Spanish and Mary was asked to teach one child to read. She was joined by her brother and then other Catholics and then Jewish children. Rule noted that he became unawares the founder of the first charity school in the garrison\". The Jews eventually withdrew on religious grounds and Rule was involved when the Lieutenant Governor Sir William Houston set up the first official free school on Flat Bastion Road in 1832 and he sent his own children there."]}, {"page": "William Rule", "response": ["*William Harris Rule (1802\u20131890), British Methodist missionary and writer"]}, {"page": "Gibraltar Public School", "response": ["Gibraltar became a Crown colony in 1830 and although the official language was English the children were mostly taught in Spanish. In 1832 the then Governor of Gibraltar George Don arranged for a new school to open in Flat Bastion Road. This school opened the same year as Methodist Dr. William Harris Rule established another new school in Gibraltar. The diversity in the supply and quality of education arose from the political debates over the use of English and the choice of religion and denomination. 181 boys and 99 girls attended in 1833. In 1835 there were six private schools in Gibraltar. The school closed in 1897."]}, {"page": "Manuel Matamoros", "response": ["Matamoros left behind an extensive collection of Carte de Visite for Protestants he had met in Lausanne, Gibraltar and elsewhere.

When the Brothers arrived on the Rock, some 260 pupils were dependent upon a mock school set up at Gunners' Parade, and reported that the children were \"extremely ignorant, without any knowledge of the English language, thus making it next to impossible for the Brothers to use their English textbooks for their instruction.\" Others reported that the real reason was that the brothers could not speak Spanish and the children had not learnt English. This new school was to be a Catholic School unlike the public one in Flat Bastion Road and the Methodist School run by William Harris Rule and his wife."]}, {"page": "F\u00e9lix Torres Amat", "response": ["In 1824, he published a translation of the Bible in vernacular Spanish which had been entrusted to him by the Spanish kings Carlos IV and Fernando VII.
