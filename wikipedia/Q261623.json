The Hungarian writer Andr\u00e1s Dugonics in 1801 states: \"But those Romans who remained in Dacia mixed their Roman language with the language of the Sarmatians [of the Slavs] and that of the Dacians.

He was a steadfast defender of Presbyterianism and orthodox Calvinism in numerous controversies with English exiles in the Dutch Republic.", "John Paget seems to have been descended from the Paget family of Rothley, which is on the edge of Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire.Hall, p. 295. He and Thomas Paget, his younger brother and fellow Puritan minister, were possibly born there or elsewhere in the county. His nephew and adopted son, Robert Paget, described himself as, Licestrensis, \"a Leicestershire man\",Peacock, p. 75. on registration at Leiden University in 1628, suggesting that John and Thomas Paget had at least one brother who continued to live in the county. The vicar of Rothley in 1564 was Harold PagetBooker, p.66. and the family's connection with the village was long-lasting: a memorial window to family members was dedicated in the parish church in 1897.", "John Paget entered Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar, a scholar receiving some support, probably in 1592, suggesting a birth date around 1574. He graduated B.A. in 1595, and proceeded M.A. in 1598.", "On 9 March Goffe wrote to update Boswell on proceedings in the Amsterdam classis, relying on information from John Paget's kinsman,Burrage, volume 2, p.281. perhaps Robert Paget. Paget was willing to recognise Davenport as his assistant only on his own terms, which presumably included continuing infant baptism. Davenport himself wrote to Boswell, asserting his personal loyalty to Charles I and his entirely peaceable intentions.Burrage, volume 2, p.282-4. Goffe was soon writing of the outrage caused by the radical Calvinists' refusal of communion to men otherwise considered in good standing with their churches.Burrage, volume 2, p.284-5.  Davenport denounced Paget as an \"unjust doer,\" tyrannical in government and corrupt in doctrine. However, Griffin Higgs, the chaplain to Charles I's sister, Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, commented: \"Mr. Damport is still a Non-Conformist to the Dutch Church as well, as to the English.\"Burrage, volume 2, p.285. The Dutch ecclesiastical authorities generally took, or were induced to take, Paget's side and he saw off all challengers. In 1635 he concluded hostilities with An Answer to the Unjust Complaints, a broadside against Davenport and William Best, who in reality was a cipher for John Canne, a separatist who had migrated to Amsterdam some years earlier.Burrage, volume 1, p. 178", "He was part of a learned circle that included the much-maligned Ainsworth, Hugh Broughton and Matthew Slade. However, Paget was more cautious and conservative in adopting readings and interpretations from Jewish scholars than philo-semitic interpreters like Ainsworth and Dury. His reservations were set out in An Admonition touching Talmudique allegations, which was appended to An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes. Here he made clear that one of his motivations in using Jewish sources was to employ them controversially against Judaism.An Admonition, p. 339. The interest in Judaism, its Scripture and its intellectual traditions was spreading within Dutch Calvinist culture and Leiden University was at its centre. Joseph Justus Scaliger had pioneered Semitic studies there and in 1625 the university press acquired an oriental section, with fonts for a range of Afroasiatic languages, on the initiative of the House of Elzevir.Boxer, p. 178. It was also the university most closely associated with overseas trade and expansion.Boxer, p. 176. Two of John Paget's nephews were sent to Leiden for their education: Robert in 1628 and Nathan in 1638. In the quarter century 1626\u201350 Leiden drew 52% of its students from abroad.Boxer, p. 177.", "John Paget remained in post until 1637, when he became emeritus. It is possible that he was already ill. Samuel Hartlib heard in July 1638 that Paget was recovering from an illness.Hartlib Papers, Ref: 11/1/117A-B However he died only about a month later, on 18 August 1638, probably in the vicinity of Amsterdam. Thomas Paget (d. 1660), his brother, then served the English Church at Amsterdam, alongside Julines Herring,Steven, p. 279. until he returned to England in 1646 to become incumbent of St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury.", "John Paget married Briget Thrush, n\u00e9e Masterson or Maisterson, on 8 February 1602 in St Mary's Church, Nantwich. The Mastersons were the oldest-established of Nantwich's wealthy merchant families.Hall, p. 416. The marriage was childless but they adopted as their heir Robert Paget, nephew of John and Thomas, who was minister at Dordrecht 1638-85.Steven, p. 300. After John Paget's death, Briget acted as his literary executor and moved to live with Robert at Dordrecht. Together with Thomas and Nathan Paget, they transmitted John's intellectual legacy to later generations of Puritans and nonconformists.", "Briget and Robert first issued John's Meditations of Death in 1639, with a preface over Robert's name. Briget wrote the dedication, which was to Elizabeth of Bohemia. Next, in 1641, came John's Defence of Church-government, a detailed exposition and defence of the Presbyterian polity as he had practised and experienced it in Amsterdam. The preface, again credited to Robert Paget, situated the work within John Paget's controversies with the Amsterdam separatists.The Publisher to the Christian Reader. Robert's concluding peroration began with the words: \"Farewell from Dort: Where a most pregnant & effectuall testimonie hath been given, for the needfull authority of Synods.\" This reference to the Synod of Dort placed Paget's work within the mainstream Calvinist tradition by harking back to the past. By this time Charles I's attempts to impose the Prayer Book on an unwilling Scotland had led to the Bishops' Wars and the bankrupting of his attempt at absolute monarchy, forcing him to fall back on Parliament. Thomas Paget, closely following developments in England, re-purposed his brother's book as a political intervention. A Puritan petition from Cheshire to the Long Parliament had proposed the abolition of bishops, canon law, the Prayer Book, and the Thirty-Nine Articles,Urwick, p. xiv. provoking a concerted response from royalists headed by Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet. Their petition supported episcopacy and denounced all Puritans as \"Schismatiques and Separatists.\"Urwick, p. xv-xvi. Aston published alongside it a collection of documents under the title A Remonstrance Against Presbytery. Thomas Paget decided to present his brother's book to Parliament, adding by way of dedication a \"Humble Advertisment\" [sic], which explained the history of nonconformity in the Diocese of Chester and highlighted his own sufferings for the cause,Thomas Paget, Humble Advertisment p. 4ff. as well as distinguishing Presbyterianism from more radical Puritan tendencies. Drawing on their Dutch experience, he pointed out that \"The United Netherlands doe finde by experience that Presbytery is no way to conducible to Anarchie.\"Thomas Paget, Humble Advertisment p. 18.", "John Paget's works comprise:"]}, {"page": "Never Mind the Balkans, Here's Romania", "response": ["Some reviewers described the author as 'a British Ion Luca Caragiale', and one perceived a direct link to foreign travel writers of previous centuries in Romania, such as John Paget, James Henry Skene, Emily Gerard and Sacheverell Sitwell.
