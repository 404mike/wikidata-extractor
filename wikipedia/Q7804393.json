From 1997 to 2003, he focused on electronic music and DJ'd internationally, releasing in 2000 his debut album Fresh Produce on Ninja Tune. Since the 2006 release of his album Biscuits for Breakfast, the name Fink has also referred to the recording and touring trio fronted by Greenall himself, completed by Guy Whittaker (bass) and Tim Thornton (drums).", "Towards the mid-2000s, Greenall developed a disillusionment with dance music and being a DJ and began to turn to more traditional musical avenues. It was this feeling which resulted in 2006's Biscuits for Breakfast, the first album to feature current collaborators Guy Whittaker and Tim Thornton, with whom Greenall had been friends for a few years but had not yet worked. Built around his bluesy voice, finger-picking acoustic guitar and the stripped-back live rhythm section, the self-produced Biscuits boasted a fledgling pop sensibility while retaining some of the signature Ninja Tune sonic hallmarks. He became the label's first singer/songwriter. The album, along with single \"Pretty Little Thing\", helped define his style and began to bring his name to a wider, and higher-profile, audience, notably Zero 7, who invited Fink to support them on their UK tour."]}, {"page": "Thornton (surname)", "response": ["* Tim Thornton (bishop) (born 1957), Bishop of Truro, and of Sherborne", "* Tim Thornton (double bassist) (born 1988), British jazz double bassist", "* Tim Thornton (musician, born 1973), English drummer, guitarist and novelist", "* Tim Thornton (philosopher) (born 1966), British philosopher"]}, {"page": "Sort of Revolution", "response": ["* Tim Thornton \u2013 drums (exc. 3, 7), effects (9)"]}, {"page": "Biscuits for Breakfast", "response": ["Prior to this album, Fin Greenall had been DJing and producing for label Ninja Tune from around 1997.
