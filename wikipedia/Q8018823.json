William Stewart, drawn from officers and other ranks from drafts of a variety of British regiments. The Corps differed in several regards from the line infantry of the British Army and most significantly were armed with the formidable Baker rifle. The rifle was remarkably accurate in an era when it was generally considered impractical for individual soldiers to aim at specific targets.Nosworthy, Brent (1997), \"Battle tactics of Napoleon and his enemies\", Constable Riflemen wore dark green jackets rather than the bright red coats of the British line infantry regiments of that time, close-fitting pantaloons rather than breeches, black facings and black belts rather than white and a green plume on their \"stovepipe shakoes\".", "Four months after its formation, the Rifle Corps was judged ready for its first operation. On 25 August 1800, three companies, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel William Stewart, spearheaded a British amphibious landing at Ferrol, Spain, where the Rifles helped to dislodge the Spanish defenders on the heights. Despite this, the expedition was defeated and withdrew on 26 August 1800. In April 1801, one company of the Experimental Corps of Riflemen, under the command of Captain Sidney Beckwith, took part in the British victory at the Battle of Copenhagen, as marksmen aboard Royal Navy ships that were under the overall command of Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson. During the battle, the Rifle Corps suffered one lieutenant killed, its first officer to fall, and two other ranks killed and six wounded, some of whom died later."]}, {"page": "William Stewart", "response": ["*William Stewart (governor) (1769\u20131854), Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales", "*William Stewart (New Zealand politician) (1861\u20131955), Reform Party member of House of Representatives", "* William Stewart (Canada West) (1803\u20131856), Canadian businessman and political figure", "* William Stewart (Ontario politician), leader of the Communist party in Ontario in the 1970s", "* William Stewart (bishop of Aberdeen) (c. 1490\u20131545), Scottish clergyman and diplomat", "* William Stewart (makar) (c.1476\u2013c.1548), Scottish poet", "* William Stewart (Lord Mayor of London), lord mayor of London", "* William Stewart (Belfast South MP) (1868\u20131946), Northern Ireland member of Parliament of the United Kingdom", "* William Stewart (Houghton-le-Spring MP) (1878\u20131960), English member of Parliament", "* William Stewart (ILP politician) (1856\u20131947), Secretary of the Scottish Divisional Council of the Independent Labour Party", "* William Stewart (Northern Ireland senator) (born ), member of the Senate of Northern Ireland", "* William Stewart (politician, died 1748) (c. 1706\u20131748), Scottish member of Parliament of Great Britain", "* William Stewart (MP for Kirkcudbright) (1737\u20131797), Scottish member of Parliament of Great Britain", "* William Stewart (British Army officer, born 1774) (1774\u20131827), Scottish member of Parliament of Great Britain", "* William Stewart (soldier) (1643\u20131726), Scots-Irish soldier", "* William Stewart, 1st Earl of Blessington (1709\u20131769), Anglo-Irish peer and member of the House of Lords", "* William Stewart, 2nd Viscount Mountjoy (1675\u20131728), Anglo-Irish peer", "* William Stewart of Caverston, Scottish soldier, captain of Dumbarton Castle", "* William Stewart of Houston (1540\u20131605), Scottish soldier, privy councilor and diplomat", "* William Stewart of Monkton (d. 1588), Scottish landowner", "* William Stewart (courtier), Scottish servant to James VI", "* William Stewart, Lord Allanbridge (1925\u20132012), Scottish judge", "* William Stewart, 1st Viscount Mountjoy (1653\u20131692), Anglo-Irish peer and soldier", "* William Stewart (Pennsylvania politician) (1810\u20131876), represented 23rd congressional district from 1857 to 1861", "* William Stewart (biologist) (born 1935), Scottish microbiologist", "* William Stewart (footballer, born 1868), Scottish footballer who played for Preston North End and Everton in the 1890s", "* William Stewart (footballer, born 1876), Scottish international footballer who played for Queen's Park and Newcastle United", "* William Stewart (footballer, born 1897) (1897\u20131974), Scottish footballer who played for Queen's Park and Shawfield", "* William Stewart (footballer, born 1910), Scottish footballer who played for Manchester United and Motherwell", "* William Stewart (Australian cricketer) (1844\u2013?), Australian cricketer", "* William Stewart (English cricketer) (1847\u20131883), English cricketer", "* William Stewart (cyclist) (1883\u20131950), British Olympic cyclist", "* William Stewart (athlete) (1889\u20131958), Australian sprinter"]}, {"page": "Battle of Orthez", "response": ["Wellington's army consisted of the 1st Division under Kenneth Howard (6,898 men), 2nd Division commanded by William Stewart (7,780 men), 3rd Division led by Thomas Picton (6,626 men), 4th Division directed by Lowry Cole (5,952 men), 5th Division under Andrew Hay (4,553 men), 6th Division commanded by Henry Clinton (5,571 men), 7th Division led by George Townshend Walker (5,643 men), Light Division under Charles Alten (3,480 men), Portuguese Division directed by Carlos Lecor (4,465 men) and Spanish Division led by Morillo (4,924 men).
