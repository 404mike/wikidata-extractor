Draper was a member of the Family Compact and Harrison was a moderate Reformer, the predecessor of the Liberal Party of Canada.\nBorn in Manchester England to John and Mary Harrison, Harrison was a lawyer, miller, politician, and judge. He was called to the bar in 1832 and entered practice in London. Because of ill health, he retired to Upper Canada near Oakville in 1837, intending to become a gentleman farmer. He also built a sawmill and gristmill on his property. In 1839, he was called to the bar in Upper Canada and was appointed a justice of the peace in the following year.\nIn 1841, Lord Sydenham appointed him provincial secretary for Canada West in the Executive Council of the Province of Canada. After two unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada (in Hamilton and then Kent), he was elected in a by-election in Kingston on July 1, 1841.  He served as government leader with William Henry Draper. In 1842, he was appointed to the Board of Works which was responsible for the building and improvement of canals within the province. Harrison was responsible for drafting and introducing the Common Schools Bill and the District Councils Bill which established elected municipal government in Canada West. Harrison introduced amendments which watered down Robert Baldwin's resolutions calling for responsible government to make them acceptable to Sydenham. However, it was Harrison who recommended to Sydenham's successor, Sir Charles Bagot, that Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine be invited to form the next government. Harrison served as provincial secretary in the new administration but resigned in 1843 to protest the movement of the capital from Kingston to Montreal. He was elected again to the assembly in Kent in 1844 but resigned in 1845 to accept an appointment as judge of the Surrogate Court for the Home District. He served in that position for 22 years, continuing in the court for York County after the district was abolished. He was named to the Board of Education for Canada West and also served in the Senate for the University of Toronto.\nHarrison died in Toronto shortly after Confederation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1867 in Canada", "response": ["thumb|right|150px|Samuel Harrison", "*July 23 \u2013 Samuel Harrison, farmer, lawyer, mill owner, politician, judge and 1st Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada (born 1802)"]}, {"page": "List of joint premiers of the Province of Canada", "response": ["| align=\"center\"| PremierSamuel HarrisonThis was a coalition of the moderate wings of the conservative and reform factions, rather than a regionally-based one.(1802-1867)"]}, {"page": "1802 in Canada", "response": ["*March 4 \u2013 Samuel Harrison, farmer, lawyer, mill owner, politician, judge and 1st Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada (d.1867)"]}, {"page": "1846 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "1841 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "1842 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "1843 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "1844 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "1845 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "1847 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "1848 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "1849 in Canada", "response": ["**Samuel Harrison, Canada East Premier"]}, {"page": "William Henry Draper (judge)", "response": ["He was elected to the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada representing Toronto in 1836. Later that year, he was appointed to the Executive Council and became solicitor general the following year. Draper handled many of the prosecutions following the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. By 1839 he had broken with his Family Compact friends and set his political goal: \"To found a party on a larger basis than ever had been formed before.\" In 1840, he became attorney general for Upper Canada.  Draper supported the union of Upper and Lower Canada on economic grounds and also believed that, because the British government favoured the union, that it would be better to participate in the process than to criticize from the sidelines.  He was elected to the 1st Parliament of the United Canadas as a moderate conservative and continued as attorney general for Canada West, a member of the Executive Council, and co-leader of the government in the Assembly along with the moderate liberal Samuel Harrison. Although his first attempts to establish a conservative alliance with French Canadians failed, Draper played an important role in enabling Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine to take office in 1842, even at the cost of resigning himself and seeing Robert Baldwin succeed him as attorney general West.  Draper resumed leading the government 13 December 1843 jointly with Denis-Benjamin Viger, and through the next election of 1844, in which the supporters of Draper, Viger and the governor Charles Metcalfe, including the young John A. Macdonald, won a majority. He continued as government leader until 1847. During this period, legislation was passed dealing with schools in both Canada East and Canada West, although Draper's attempt to establish a University of Upper Canada failed. Draper helped John A. Macdonald gain recognition when he named him to a cabinet post. In 1847, with the arrival of Lord Elgin, Draper resigned from the position of attorney general and became a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. In 1856, he became chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas of Upper Canada and, in 1869, he became chief justice of the Court of Error and Appeal in Ontario."]}, {"page": "List of joint premiers of the Province of Canada by time in office", "response": ["#Samuel Harrison: 11 months, 7 days"]}, {"page": "Ariah Park", "response": ["* Samuel Harrison, Publican and Hotelier (Ariah Park Hotel latterly Railway Hotel, opened Saturday 31 October 1903) 1857 - 1920"]}, {"page": "Samuel Bealey Harrison", "response": ["#redirect Samuel Harrison"]}, {"page": "Samuel Harrison (disambiguation)", "response": ["Samuel Harrison was a Canadian politician.", "Samuel Harrison may also refer to:", "*Samuel Harrison (singer) (1760\u20131812), English singer", "*Rev.
