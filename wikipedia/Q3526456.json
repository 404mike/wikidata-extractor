Primarily a left-arm spin bowler, Peel was also an effective left-handed batsman who played in the middle order. Between 1884 and 1896, he was regularly selected to represent England, playing 20 Test matches in which he took 101 wickets. Over the course of his career, he scored 12,191 runs and took 1,775 wickets in first-class cricket. A match-winning bowler, particularly when conditions favoured his style, Peel generally opened the attack, an orthodox tactic for a spinner at the time, and was highly regarded by critics.\nPeel began playing for Yorkshire in 1883 but, after a successful debut, was overshadowed in the team by Edmund Peate and often played only a minor role with the ball. Improvements in his batting and his excellence as a fielder kept him in the team, and when Peate was sacked for drunkenness in 1887, Peel became Yorkshire's main spinner. He had already played for England, touring Australia with two professional teams, although he did not play a Test in England until 1888. Over the following years he regularly took over 100 wickets in each season and often played in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players matches. He was generally Yorkshire's leading bowler\u2014until the emergence of George Hirst, he generally received little support from other members of the attack\u2014and often among their leading batsmen. His best season in county cricket came in 1896, when he recorded the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets, and made his highest first-class score of 210. Among his notable feats in Tests, he bowled England to victory after they had followed on in Australia in 1894\u201395 and took six for 23 in his final Test. The first English cricketer to reach 100 wickets against Australia, in 1894\u201395 he also became the first player to fail to score in four successive Test innings.\nAs a player, Peel was very popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became well known for liking alcohol. On the morning of the match that England won after following on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened\u2014Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction\u2014he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket for most of his life and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ashes", "response": ["The 1894\u201395 series began in sensational fashion when England won the First Test at Sydney by just 10 runs having followed on.

Yorkshire improved in 1883 and finished second behind Nottinghamshire in the unofficial County Championship. However, the remainder of the 1880s was disappointing for the team and its supporters. Kilburn said that Yorkshire \"continued to be an unreliable side, mingling brilliant achievement with miserable performance\". The basic problem was that the older players were past their peak while younger replacements did not make the progress expected. A poor season on the field in 1889 was reflected by reduced income and changes were made with several good new players being introduced. These included Jack Brown, David Hunter and Stanley Jackson, while Bobby Peel was becoming increasingly effective as a bowling all-rounder. They were followed by John Tunnicliffe, David Denton, Ted Wainwright and George Hirst.

The following season, he was spotted by Yorkshire coach George Hirst and former England spinner Bobby Peel, who were talent scouting for Yorkshire, and given a trial in the cricket nets at Headingley. Peel realised Verity was an intelligent bowler who had excellent control of where he pitched the ball, but believed he was not fast enough to be effective for Yorkshire.Hill, p. 24. Meanwhile, critics in Rawdon began to see increased potential in his batting, which improved steadily; by 1924, the Yorkshire Evening Post described Verity as \"one of the most promising cricketers in the Leeds district\".Hill, pp. 24\u201325."]}, {"page": "George Lohmann", "response": ["In 1888, a summer as wet as 1887 had been dry, Lohmann took full advantage of the dreadful pitches on which most matches were played, taking 209 wickets for only 10.90 each (including 143 in 14 county matches). In the three Tests against Australia, Briggs, Bobby Peel and Billy Barnes did so well that Lohmann had to do little bowling at the Oval and Old Trafford. However, he took eight wickets at Lord's and made his only Test fifty at the Oval. In 1889, Lohmann again took over 200 wickets (115 for 1485 runs in purely county matches) and took nine wickets in an innings for the first time against Sussex."]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["As a captain, Hawke was noted for taking a strong, and some would say paternalistic, interest in the welfare of his professional players. Certain aspects of this policy caused resentment but he was on the whole respected for it. Even so, he was strict on discipline and expelled the England bowler Bobby Peel from first-class cricket after he went out to play in a drunken state.", "In a tribute to Hawke, the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack related that Hawke's \"strength of the character was tested\" when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of \"elements that were not entirely harmonious\". Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\". Derek Birley commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as \"gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals\" who were often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\".Birley, pp. 134\u2013135. The odd man out was Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for them. Their best players included Emmett, Ephraim Lockwood, George Ulyett, Ted Peate, Billy Bates and Allen Hill, while Bobby Peel made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and \"rough-hewn image\" had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would \"instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team\".", "thumb|right|Bobby Peel", "Although some people assumed that Hawke had turned his back on Yorkshire, he returned with new vigour in 1886 to begin what he himself referred to as his consistent association with the county. While Hawke had formerly been the figurehead who tossed the coin, he now took complete charge of operations and began the transformation of the team in earnest.Coldham, p. 47. The team that Hawke inherited from Emmett, which Hawke referred to as \"the boys of my old brigade\", was in decline by 1886 and several players would retire or be dismissed during the next couple of years so that, by the end of the 1887 season, it was clear that Yorkshire faced what Coldham called \"a protracted period of rebuilding\".Coldham, p. 59. Within the next seasons, the likes of Ted Peate, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett, Louis Hall and George Ulyett had all retired. Left arm spinner Bobby Peel, wicket-keeper David Hunter, all-rounder George Hirst, opening batsman Jack Brown and the amateurs Stanley Jackson and Ernest Smith were among the replacements who formed Yorkshire's successful teams of the 1890s and 1900s.Hodgson, p. 53.", "One of Hawke's qualities as a leader was his willingness to impose discipline when necessary and a famous instance of this occurred in 1897 when he was forced to dismiss Bobby Peel from Yorkshire's service for drunkenness.Birley, p. 156. However, Peel's replacement was Wilfred Rhodes who became arguably the club's greatest-ever player.Kilburn, p. 27. Yorkshire won a third title in 1898, the same year that Hawke was elected Yorkshire President in succession to Michael Ellison, and he again scored two centuries in the season. He just missed his thousand runs, scoring 950 at 30.64 including scores of 107 not out for Yorkshire against Kent and 134 for Yorkshire against Warwickshire. In 1899, he scored 923 runs at 26.37 with a highest score of 127 for Yorkshire against Hampshire.", "Although he was benevolent in his care of his players, Hawke would not tolerate any action that brought the game into disrepute or was perceived to be outside its \"spirit\". When Bobby Peel went out to play under the effects of too much alcohol, Hawke escorted him off the field and, as Peel himself sarcastically noted: \"Lord Hawke put his arm round me and helped me off the ground \u2013 and out of first-class cricket. What a gentleman!\" Hawke always carried himself as he thought a gentleman should and Bill Bowes, who first met him in 1928, recalled his \"mannerism of pulling his shoulders back as he spoke, like a sergeant major in the Guards\".Bowes, p. 27."]}, {"page": "ICC Men's Player Rankings", "response": ["| 1896 || Jack Lyons ||  || Bobby Peel || ", "| 1891 || WG Grace ||  || Bobby Peel || ", "| 1890 || WG Grace ||  || Bobby Peel || ", "| 1888 || Arthur Shrewsbury ||  || Bobby Peel || "]}, {"page": "History of Test cricket from 1890 to 1900", "response": ["In 1894/5 Andrew Stoddart led a team to Australia that played five Tests in a see-saw series that saw England win the Ashes by 3 games to 2.

The Australians won 13\u00a0matches on tour, losing\u00a016 and drawing\u00a09. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord's Cricket Ground. He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1\u00a0not out and in the second, 5\u00a0runs batting at number ten.

Richardson's skilful bowling however saw Trumble and Kelly batting together with only 3\u00a0wickets in hand but with 25\u00a0runs still to make. Against excellent bowling and in a tense atmosphere, the pair managed to bat Australia home with the last runs taking an hour to score, mainly in singles. Trumble made 17\u00a0not out to follow his 24\u00a0runs in the first innings and his 4\u00a0wickets. With the series tied at one Test apiece, the Third and final Test was played at The Oval in London. On a pitch damaged by rain, the English batted first and were dismissed for 145. Trumble took 6\u00a0wickets for 59\u00a0runs, including a 9-over spell of 5\u00a0wickets for 10\u00a0runs. England fought back to bowl the Australians out for 119.

Wisden noted: \"For some time after his first season Hirst's career was one of steady progress rather than of brilliant achievement.\" Hirst's batting remained undeveloped in 1893; he batted at number 10 and did not pass fifty in any one innings, though he managed some useful scores.Thomson, p. 28. He averaged only 15.04 with the bat, but his bowling continued to make a good impression on critics. He took 99 wickets at an average of 14.39, placing him third in the Yorkshire averages for the season; that year, the county won the official County Championship, which had begun in 1890, for the first time. In 1894, Hirst scored his maiden first-class century against Gloucestershire, hitting an unbeaten 115 out of a partnership of 176 for the ninth wicket. Although this was his only score over fifty, Wisden recorded how his batting often helped his team out of difficult situations.Thomson, p. 29. In total, he hit 564 runs at an average of 16.58. With the ball, his record was similar to the previous season. He took 98 wickets at an average of 15.98, and his best figures came in a match against Lancashire, a feat appreciated by Yorkshire supporters as the fixture was always highly competitive.Thomson, p. 30. Then in the 1895 season, Hirst passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time, securing 150 wickets at an average of 17.06. He established himself as an opening bowler for Yorkshire, assuming the role from Ted Wainwright and developing a good partnership with Bobby Peel.Thomson, p. 22. Against Leicestershire, he took a hat-trick. Although primarily regarded as a bowler, and while Wisden later described his batting as being in \"temporary decline\" in 1895, Hirst also scored 710 runs at an average of 19.18, with three fifties."]}, {"page": "Robert Peel (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Bobby Peel (1857\u20131941), 19th century Yorkshire and England cricketer"]}, {"page": "1890 English cricket season", "response": ["|Bobby Peel || England, North, Players, Yorkshire || 33 || 7,755 || 171 || 13.07"]}, {"page": "Tom Emmett", "response": ["Born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, Emmett first joined Yorkshire when almost 25 as a professional fast left-arm bowler with a near roundarm action, though in his later years he took to bowling slow-medium.

An even greater bowler, George Freeman, was approaching his best at the same time, and, from 1867 to the end of 1871, they dominated the English bowling scene. After 1871, however, business commitments took Freeman away from first-class cricket, but Emmett stayed on and found another able colleague in the excellent Allen Hill.
