He was born and died at Pill, Somerset.\nBunce was a left-handed middle- or lower-order batsman and an occasional right-arm medium-fast bowler. He played in five matches in the 1936 season, all of them away from Somerset, without much success, but did better in his nine games in 1937, scoring 185 runs at an average of 18.50 runs per innings. His highest score came in one of only three home games he played in his Somerset career: against Kent at Bath he batted at No 10 and made 46, putting on 93 with Wally Luckes, who made his maiden century, 121 not out. His only bowling \"success\" came in his second match in 1936, when he took three wickets for 81 runs in the match against Surrey at The Oval; the success was relative, however, as Surrey amassed a total of 512 in a day and won the match by an innings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* William Bunce (1936\u20131937) 14 matches CA"]}, {"page": "William Bunce", "response": ["William Bunce  (born April 1877) was an English footballer.
