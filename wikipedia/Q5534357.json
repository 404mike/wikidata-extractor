In his first season, he was used in a variety of positions, eventually settling in at centre-forward alongside the newly arrived and prolific Geoff Vowden. Their goals failed to prevent relegation to the Second Division in 1964\u201365. In his last full season he played successfully at right half in place of captain Ron Wylie who had broken his leg. Wylie's return to fitness and the arrival of former England centre-forward Fred Pickering left no place for Thomson, so in December 1967 he moved to Third Division Stockport County, and then into non-league football with Bromsgrove Rovers."]}, {"page": "Johnny Vincent (footballer)", "response": ["Vincent was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire. He joined Birmingham City when he left school, and made his first-team debut in March 1964, shortly after his 17th birthday. His style of play was elegant and he was consistent in his ability to launch an attack, whether by good passing of the ball or by purposeful running. When he became a first team regular, some three years after making his debut, he was creating chances for Barry Bridges, Geoff Vowden and Fred Pickering; later he supplied Jimmy Greenhoff, Bob Latchford and Bob Hatton. He had a powerful shot himself; for Birmingham he scored 44 goals in 194 appearances in all competitions. He remained first choice under Stan Cullis's management, but Cullis's successor Freddie Goodwin traded him for Middlesbrough's more physical George Smith, both players being valued at \u00a340,000. He spent one season at Middlesbrough followed by three years with Cardiff City, before returning to the Midlands with Atherstone Town. He finished his playing career with a season in the NASL with Connecticut Bicentennials."]}, {"page": "Joe Mallett", "response": ["In June 1964 he joined Birmingham City as coach, and a month later accepted the vacant managerial position.
