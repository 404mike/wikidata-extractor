In 1907 Guy Thorne wrote that \"In the realm of the fantastic, it has no equal...It has all the fantastic unreality of Chinese dragons, and therefore can in no way be harmful...Whilst we are alternately fascinated and repelled by the subject, we are lost in admiration of the decorative treatment of the theme\".  An anonymous writer in The Academy in 1909 considered it \"perhaps Wilde's most complete and satisfactory poetical work, for here he was hampered neither by the insincerity which sacrifices everything to style on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, by the crude brutality of real and horrible life breaking like a violent unresolved discord into the harmony of his delicate yet stately music.\"  In the same year The Globe declared it \"among the most remarkable works ever penned by human hand...If such lines have not the haunting, magical touch of the true poet, we know not where to look for it in all English literature.\""]}]}}
