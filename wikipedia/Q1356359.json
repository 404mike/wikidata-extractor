H. Moore generalised matrix inverse, also known as the Moore\u2013Penrose inverse, after it had been reinvented by Arne Bjerhammar in 1951. Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir W. V. D. Hodge, Penrose finished his PhD at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1958, with a thesis on \"tensor methods in algebraic geometry\" under algebraist and geometer John A. Todd. He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s, describing it as \"impossibility in its purest form\", and exchanged material with the artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. Escher's Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending were in turn inspired by Penrose."]}, {"page": "Hodge star operator", "response": ["In mathematics, the Hodge star operator or Hodge star is a linear map defined on the exterior algebra of a finite-dimensional oriented vector space endowed with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form.  Applying the operator to an element of the algebra produces the Hodge dual of the element.  This map was introduced by W. V. D. Hodge."]}, {"page": "Arthur Cayley", "response": ["In addition to his work on algebra, Cayley made fundamental contributions to algebraic geometry.
