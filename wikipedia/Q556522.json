Arminians find the Scriptures describing both the initial act of faith in Christ, \"whereby the relationship is effected\", and the persevering faith in him \"whereby the relationship is sustained.\"Shank, Life in the Son, 92; cf. Arrington, Unconditional Eternal Security: Myth or Truth? 182. Marshall writes: \"The Christian life is a life which is continually sustained by the power of God. It does not merely depend upon a once-for-all gift of God received in the moment of conversion, but is a continual relationship to God in which His gracious gifts are received by faith\" (Kept by the Power, 22). The relationship of \"the believer to Christ is never a static relationship existing as the irrevocable consequence of a past decision, act, or experience.\"Shank, Life in the Son, 116. cf. Williams, Renewal Theology 2:127, 134\u2013135. Brenda Colijn writes: \"Salvation is not a transaction but an ongoing relationship between the Rescuer and the rescued, between the Healer and the healed. The best way to ensure faithfulness is to nurture that relationship. Final salvation, like initial salvation, is appropriated by grace through faith(fulness) (; )... Salvation is not a one-time event completed at conversion. It involves a growth in relationship ... that is not optional or secondary but is essential to what salvation means\" (Images of Salvation in the New Testament, 140\u2013141). Rather, it is a living union \"proceeding upon a living faith in a living Savior.\"Shank, Life in the Son, 116. In another place Shank writes: \"The faith on which our union with Christ depends is not the act of some past moment. It is a present living faith in a living Savior\" (Life in the Son, 66). This living union is captured in the simple command by Christ, \"Remain in me, and I in you\" ().Shank, Life in the Son, 43, 116.", "I. Howard Marshall notes that aphistemi \"is used of giving up the faith in Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 4:1 and Hebrews 3:12, and is used of departure from God in the LXX [i.e., Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament].\"Kept by the Power, 217, note 5; cf. Williams, Renewal Theology, 2:131\u2013135. Marshall also notes that \"the failure to persist in faith is expressed by [other Greek] words which mean falling away, drifting and stumbling.\"Kept by the Power, 23; These are the other Greek words connected to apostasy: \"[pipt\u014d], 'to fall' (Romans 11:11, 22; 14:4; 1 Corinthians 10:12; 13:8; Hebrews 4:11; Revelation 2:5); [parapipt\u014d], 'to fall away, transgress' (Hebrews 6:6), [pararrhe\u014d], 'to drift away' (Hebrews 2:1); the root [skandal-], 'to stumble, offend' is also important\" (Marshall, Kept by the Power, 217, note 4). Of particular theological significanceI. Howard Marshall, Kept by the Power of God: A Study of Perseverance and Falling Away, 217. are the verb skandaliz\u014d (\"fall away from faith\")Heinz Giesen, Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, 3:248. and the noun skandalon (\"enticement to unbelief, cause of salvation's loss, seduction\").Heinz Giesen, Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, 3:249. Heinz Giesen writes: In the passive voice \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [skandaliz\u014d] more often means ... \"fall away from faith.\" In the interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark 4:13-20 par. Matt 13:18\u201323) those identified with the seeds sown on rocky ground, i.e., those \"with no root in themselves,\" the inconstant ones, go astray to their own ruin when persecuted on account of the word, i.e., they fall away from faith (Mark 4:17 par. Matt 13:21). The Lukan parallel reads appropriately \u1f00\u03c6\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 [aphist\u0113mi, fall away] (8:13). In Matt 24:10 Jesus predicts that in the end time many will fall away [skandaliz\u014d]. The result is that they will hate one another, wickedness will be multiplied, and love will grow cold. Yet whoever endures in love until the end will be saved (vv. 11, 13). ... In the Johannine farewell address (John 16:1) \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [skandaliz\u014d] does not only imply an \"endangering of faith\" ... but rather \"falling away from faith\" entirely, from which the disciples and Christians are to be kept. ... In the active voice \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [skandaliz\u014d] means \"cause someone to fall away from (or reject) faith,\" as in the saying of Jesus about the person who \"causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin [stumble]\" (Mark 9:42 par. Matt 18:6/Luke 17:2). The Christian is enjoined to reject anything that might be an obstacle to faith, as emphasized in Mark 9:43, 45, 47 in metaphorical, hyperbolic language: Hand, foot, and eye\u2014in Jewish understanding the loci of lust or sinful desires\u2014must be given up if they threaten to become the cause of loss of faith and thus of salvation. This ... underscores the seriousness of conviction within which one must persevere if one wishes to enter (eternal) life or the kingdom of God. ... Matt 5:29, 30 also issues an exhortation to decisive action [cf. Matt 18:8, 9]. ... According to 1 Cor 8:9 a Christian's freedom regarding eating food offered to idols reaches its limit when it becomes a stumbling block to one's brother (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 [proskomma]). Hence Paul emphasizes that he will never again eat meat if by doing so he causes his brother to fall and thus to lose salvation (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [skandaliz\u014d], v. 13a, b), since otherwise that weaker brother is destroyed by the knowledge of the \"stronger\" (v. 11). Whoever sins against his brothers sins also against Christ (v. 12). ... Within the context of the protection of the \"little ones\" in the Church, i.e., probably the \"weak ones\" ([Matthew] 18:6\u201310), Jesus utters an eschatological threat (\"woe!\") against the world (alienated from God) because of temptations to sin (v. 7a); though he allows that such temptations must come (v. 7b), he finally hurls an eschatological \"woe!\" against the person by whom the temptation comes (v. 7c). \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [skandalon] used here of the temptation to fall away from faith. The parallel, Luke 17:1, like Matt 18:7b, also underscores that such temptations are unavoidable; nonetheless, the person by whom they come receives the eschatological \"woe!\" that already places him under divine judgment. ... In Rom 14:13 Paul admonishes the \"strong,\" whose position he fundamentally shares (v. 14), not to cause the \"weak\" any stumbling block to faith through eating habits . ... In Rom 16:17 the \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [skandalon] are the various satanic activities of the false teachers who endanger the salvation of Church members, who are being seduced into falling away from correct teaching; such teachers also threaten both the unity and very existence of the Church. Similarly, in Rev 2:14 \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [skandalon] refers to a stumbling block to faith in the context of false teaching. According to 1 John 2:10 there is no cause for stumbling or sin in a believer who loves his brother ... i.e., no cause for unbelief and thus a loss of salvation.

Rev. 21:7-8 with Gal. 5:19-21).Paul's warning about not inheriting the kingdom of God \"means exactly what we generally interpret it to mean: The person who lives in such sins will not live with God's children in eternity\" (Robert Picirilli, Galatians, 92).", "Paul issues \"a solemn warning based on an agricultural principle: Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows (v. 7 [NIV]). When people think and act as if they will not reap what they have sown, or as if they will reap something different from what they have sown, they are deceiving themselves and mocking God.\"G. Walter Hanson, Galatians, 194. In verse 8, Christians \"are faced with a decision, a decision\" that will determine their eternal destiny\u2014\"sowing to the flesh\" or \"sowing to the Spirit.\"Hanson, Ibid., 194. Sowing to the flesh would refer to practicing \"the works of the flesh\" already warned about in 5:19-21.Robert Picirilli, Galatians, 101. Sowing to the Spirit \"is exactly the opposite in every respect and means doing things to or with one another that stem from the Spirit's impulses. And so here we come to 'the fruit of the Spirit' listed in 5:22, 23.\"Picirilli, Ibid., 101. Paul spells out the contrasting harvests or destinies: sowing to the Spirit = \"eternal life,\" while sowing to the flesh = \"corruption.\" This warning in Galatians 6:8 is parallel \"to the warning about the possibility of not inheriting the Kingdom of God set out in 5.21,\" for those practicing the works of the flesh.Philip Esler, Galatians, 233. So I. Howard Marshall, Kept by the Power, 112. Therefore, this \"corruption\" or \"destruction\" (NIV, CSB) can mean nothing less than \"eternal destruction\"Oropeza, Ibid., 33; Harder, Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, 9:104. Paul Kretzmann sees \"eternal damnation\" (Popular Commentary on the Bible: New Testament, Vol. 2, 257. or \"eternal death\"Frank Matera, Galatians, 216. S.T.

Oropeza, Jews, Gentiles, and the Opponents of Paul, 31. This trespass (parapt\u014dma) \"is considered by Paul as a sin or an immoral act (cf. Rom 4:25; 11:11-12; 2 Cor 5:19; Col 2:13; cf. Matt 6:15). Those who operate in the fruit of the Spirit . . . are to restore such individuals, being mindful that they themselves are susceptible to temptations.\" If a believer were to continue practicing/sowing to the flesh, this would lead to their \"apostasy\" (i.e. becoming an unbeliever), with the outcome being \"eternal destruction and exclusion from God's kingdom (Gal 5:21; 6:7-8).\"Oropeza, Ibid., 31-33. Hence, Paul holds that believers who are engaged in sowing to the flesh are \"headed towards apostasy if not restored.\" \"A real danger exists that believers in Christ may apostatize, falling away from faith, and miss out on eternal life. ... For some Christians the doctrinal slogan is 'once saved, always saved.' Paul would not agree.\"Andrew Das, Galatians, 622.", "\"Central to this charge is the defense and preservation of the true faith, which is currently under attack\" from false teachers.Paul Trebilco & Simon Rae, 1 Timothy, 27. Paul depicts Timothy's role \"as a warrior in service to his or her king. This is wholly appropriate following a doxology to 'the eternal King' (1:17).\"Linda Belleville, 1 Timothy, 39. \"Timothy is to wage warfare, not by using violence, but by holding on to faith and a good conscience (v. 19).\"Trebilco & Rae, Ibid., 28. \"Faith involves here the act of trusting in God\"Trebilco & Rae, Ibid., 28.

Holding on to faith and a good conscience \"will prevent Timothy himself being endangered, when he opposes the false teachers\" (Trebilco & Rae, Ibid., 28).

Thus, Hymenaeus and Alexander \"were once true believers\"Joseph Benson, The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Vol. II\u2014Romans to the Revelation, 424. \"Indeed, none can make shipwreck of faith who never had faith\" (Benson, Ibid., 424). who \"had personal faith comparable to Timothy's (1:18-19a), but that faith was destroyed,\", and thus they became \"apostates\" (i.e., unbelievers).Quinn & Wacker, Ibid., 155; Benjamin Fiore, Pastoral Epistles, 49, 53.", "In Paul's final exhortation to Timothy in v. 16, he gives \"the reason why\" he \"is so persistent and concerned, because what is at stake is salvation for Timothy and his hearers.\"George Knight, Pastoral Epistles, 210. Traditional Calvinist George Knight observes that some commentators take save (s\u014dz\u014d, v. 16) in the sense of to preserve or be kept safe from the doctrinal error of the false teachers \"(Bengel, Gromacki, Vine, Wuest),\" but most commentators understand save \"soteriologically and eschatologically (Alford, Bernard, Brox B\u00fcrki, Calvin, Earle, Ellicott, Fairbairn, Gealy, Guthrie, Hendriksen, Hiebert, Huther, Kelly, Kent, Lenski, Moellering, Robertson, Scott, Simpson, van Oosterzee, and White; also J. Schneider, NIDNTT 3:215; W. Foerster, TDNT 7:995).\"Knight, Ibid., 211. Knight goes on to note: \"The other occurrences of [s\u014dz\u014d, save] in the PE (1 Tim. 1:15; 2:4, 15; Tit. 3:5; 2 Tim. 1:9; 4:18) are clearly soteriological [i.e., salvation] in orientation. It is true that [didaskalia, teaching] does deliver from error and bring to truth, but that seems to be included in the ultimate goal expressed in [s\u014dz\u014d, save] (cf. 2:4; so also Oosterzee). The salvation of the hearers is elsewhere depicted by Paul as the central goal of the ministry (cf. especially 1 Cor. 15:1, 2; 9:22; 2 Ti. 2:10; 4:5), and it is that hope in the living God who is the Savior of all believers that Paul has presented as the centerpiece of encouragement for Timothy in this section.\"Knight, Ibid., 211-212. Other reference works support Knight's understanding of save in v. 16. For example, in A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, Third Ed., Revised and edited by Frederick William Danker, page 982, reads: \"to save or preserve from transcendent danger or destruction, save/preserve from eternal death from judgment, and from all that might lead to such death, e.g., sin, also in a positive sense bring Messianic salvation, bring to salvation.\" On page 982 of this same Lexicon, under heading #2 a, \u03b2, we read: \"of persons who are mediators of divine salvation: apostles Ro 11:14; 1 Cor 9:22; 1 Ti 4:16b. The believing partner in a mixed marriage 1 Cor 7:16ab . . . One Christian of another . . . Js 5:20. Cp. Jd 23.\" See also, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament being Grimm's Wilke\u2019s Clavis Novi Testamenti, Translated, Revised and Enlarged by Joseph Henry Thayer, 610-611; A Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament, by Edward Robinson, 704; Biblico-Theological Lexicon of the New Testament Greek, by Hermann Cremer, translated from the German Second Edition by William Urwick, 534; Expanded Edition Strong's Complete Word Study Concordance, James Strong, and Editor of this edition, Warren Baker, 2161. Gordon Fee would agree, and thus writes: \"Salvation involves perseverance; and Timothy's task in Ephesus is to model and teach the gospel in such a fashion that it will lead the church to perseverance in faith and love and hence to final . . . salvation.\"Gordon Fee, 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus, 109 . So I. Howard Marshall, Pastoral Epistles, 571; Paul Trebilco & Simon Rae, 1 Timothy, 129. Therefore, \"Ultimate salvation is not automatic, even for Timothy. He must persevere in the faith to be saved eternally, and to be the instrument to save others.\"Frederick Claybrook, Once Saved, Always Saved? A New Testament Study of Apostasy, 120-121. George Knight observes: \"That a human being, here Timothy, is the subject of [s\u014dz\u014d, save] is a phenomenon found elsewhere in Paul (Rom. 11:14; 1 Cor. 9:22; 7:16a, b), in James (5:20), in Jude (23), and with Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels (Mk. 8:35b par. Lk. 9:24b). Thus we see that the NT speaks of human agents in addition to the ultimate and absolute source, God himself. . . . [Richard] Lenski summarizes well when he says that God alone saves (v. 10), yet he saves by means, 'and it is thus that one who uses and applies these means can very properly be said to save both himself and others'\" (Knight, Ibid., 212).", "Paul suggests in 2 Timothy 2:10, that if he faithfully endures suffering and hardship to the end of life, this will provide \"a good witness to others and is done for the sake of the chosen ones,\" in order that they, \"will persevere and go on to receive eschatological [i.e., future and final] salvation.\"Ben Witherington, Letters and Homilies for Hellenized Christians, Vol. 1, 334. \"The implicit negative corollary is that if Paul\" fails to persevere and apostatizes, then \"surely that would have led to the . . . apostasy by others\" in the church.Witherington, Ibid., 334. \"The potential for apostasy\" among believers in Ephesus \"is clearly evident in the hymn found in 2 Tim 2:11\u201313.\"B.J. Oropeza, Jews, Gentiles, and the Opponents of Paul, 278. This trustworthy saying has four \"if\" clauses that describe a believer's action that are followed by \"then\" clauses that describe Christ's action taken in response.William D. Mounce, Pastoral Epistles, 502; Witherington, Ibid., 333. The \"we\" throughout this hymn applies first to Paul and Timothy, and then \"equally to all believers.\"John Stott, 2 Timothy, 63. So Richard Lenski, 2 Timothy, 794. The hymn begins with: \"if we died with him (Christ), we will also live with him (2:11b).\"Oropeza, Ibid., 279. This line \"portrays the entire scope of Christian existence, from conversion to glorification, in terms of 'dying and rising' with Christ.\"Philip Towner, Pastoral Epistles, 510. The next clause says \"enduring\" leads to \"reigning with\" Christ. The word enduring (hupomen\u014d) means \"to persevere: absolutely and emphatically, under misfortunes and trial to hold fast to one's faith in Christ.\"A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament being Grimm's  Wilke\u2019s Clavis Novi Testamenti, Translated, Revised and Enlarged by Joseph Henry Thayer, 644. The present tense verb conveys the meaning \"keep on enduring\"Towner, Ibid., 510. George Knight, Pastoral Epistles, 404, has \"continual enduring.\" or \"persevering.\"A\u00edda Besan\u00e7on Spencer, 1 Timothy, 64. Thus, a persevering faith \"is to be a normal way of life\" for Timothy and other Christ-followers.Towner, Ibid., 510.  Paul and Timothy \"must endure in spite of every adversity, including suffering and/or imprisonment, so that others 'may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.'\"W. Hulitt Gloer, 1 & 2 Timothy-Titus, 251. Believers who faithfully keep on enduring will \"reign together with\" (symbasileu\u014d) Christ.\"This is an endurance of faith in the face of all that opposes it\" (Jon Laansma, 2 Timothy, Titus, 165). This means that they will \"share in the 'kingdom of God' (basileia tou theou), the traditional symbol of God\"s eschatological [i.e., future and final] reign (see 4:1, 18), the focus of Jesus' own preaching of the good news (see Mark 1:15).\"Raymond Collins, 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus, 227. So Arland J. Hultgren, 1-2 Timothy, Titus, 122-123. Calvinist George Knight connects the promised reigning/ruling of believers found in Rev. 22:5 with 2 Tim. 2:11, and says, \"the promised ruling with Christ in view of 2 Timothy 2:12 is a ruling of Christians together with him in his eschatological [i.e., future and final] consummation kingdom which shall never end\" (The Faithful Sayings in the Pastoral Letters, 122). \"The causal connection between perseverance in the present age of suffering and the future attainment of salvation is expressly stated in 2 Tm. 2:12.\"Hauck, Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, 4:587. The third clause contains a definite \"warning against apostasy.\"I. Howard Marshall, Pastoral Epistles, 732, 733. So Oropeza, Ibid., 279; Hultgren, Ibid., 123; Towner, Ibid., 512; Witherington, Ibid., 205, 334; Gordon Fee, 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus, 253; Robert Bratcher, A Translator\u2019s Guide to Paul\u2019s Letters to Timothy and Titus, 80.

Matt 10:33; Mark 8:38; Luke 9:36). This type of denial (\u1f00\u03c1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 [arneomai]) refers to apostasy resulting from persecution, and this is almost certainly what it means here in 2 Tim 2:12.\" To deny Jesus is the opposite of enduring/persevering (in faith) and \"means the surrender of faith, 'to apostatize.'\"Riesenfeld, Ibid., 215. Such denial reverses conversion so that Christ disowns the person who denies him, and as with the Synoptic sayings this leads to eternal judgment.Oropeza, Ibid., 280. George Knight says this denial of Christ is of the \"permanent\" kind here, for the resultant \"denial by Christ . . . is that future final evaluation which he will make to his Father (Mt. 10:33) in the presence of God\u2019s angels (Lk. 12:9) when he returns in glory (cf. Lk. 9:26; Mk. 8:38; cf. also Mt. 7:23). The finality of his denial of those who have denied him will be as permanent as decisive as theirs has been of him, and will thus not be as in Peter's case, where forgiveness was sought and received\" (Pastoral Epistles, 406). This warning is definitely directed toward Timothy, \"Paul and all believers.\"Mounce, Ibid., 517. \"If it is not possible to disown faith in Christ, there is no need for these words. The possibility of Timothy and others disowning the faith is real.\"Paul Zehr, 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus, 181.", "This is ... where the author combines urgent exhortation and solemn warning in order to move his readers to a place of renewed confidence, hope, and persevering faith in Christ. ... The close connection between this paragraph [Heb 2:1\u20134] and the exposition in 1:5\u201314 demonstrates that scriptural exposition for our author was not an end in itself but rooted out of his concern for his readers and their perilous situation. ... The Greek construction of 2:1\u20134 consists of two sentences: a direct statement (2:1), followed by a long explanatory sentence (2:2\u20134), which includes a rhetorical question (\"how shall we escape\") with a condition (\"if we ignore [or neglect] such a great salvation\") (2:3a). The word \"therefore\" (2:1) connects this paragraph to the Son's incomparable splendor and supremacy in chapter 1. Because the Son to is superior to the prophets and the angels, what God \"has spoken to us by his Son\" (1:2), if neglected, makes one that much more culpable: \"We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard\" lest we \"drift away.\" The expression \"what we have heard\" refers to God's revelation in his Son about salvation (cf. 2:3a). Here the danger of drifting away is due not to a rebellious refusal to heed the gospel, but to a carelessness about the commitment to Christ that it requires. The verb prosecho (lit., \"to give heed\") means not only \"pay attention\" with the mind to what one hears, but also \"to act upon what one perceives\" (Morris, 1981, 21). This verb is analogous to katecho in 3:6, 14; 10:23, where the readers are admonished to \"hold fast to their confession of faith, without which the goal of salvation cannot be reached\" (Lane, 1991, 37). The Greek word translated \"drift away\" (pararreo) has nautical overtones, as when a ship drifts past a harbor to shipwreck. The picture thus conveyed in 2:1 is that of Christians who are \"in peril of being carried downstream past a fixed landing place and so failing to gain its security\" (Bruce, 1990, 66). The result of drifting from Christ is a worse end than that experienced by those who disobeyed the law of Moses under the old covenant (vv. 2\u20133; cf. 10:28). As Bruce notes, \"our author is warning Christian readers, who have heard and accepted the gospel, that if they yield to the temptation to abandon their profession, their plight is hopeless\" (1990, 66). \"The message spoken by angels\" (2:2) refers to the law given at Sinai. Here we begin to see the primary reason why the Son's superiority to the angels was emphasized in 1:5\u201314. The author makes an a fortiori argument (i.e., arguing from a lesser, well-accepted truth to a greater truth, for which there is even stronger evidence) from angels to the Son, from law to gospel (cf. 7:21\u201322; 9:13\u201314; 10:28\u201329). The angels were of instrumental importance in the lesser matter of the law; the Son is of supreme importance in the greater matter of the gospel (Hagner, 1983, 21). If the law accompanied by angels was honored, how much more should we respect God\u2019s word that came in his Son! If \"every violation and disobedience\" of the law had inescapable consequences, how can we hope to escape the consequences of ignoring the gospel of Christ? Our author writes \"to awaken the conscience to the grave consequences of neglecting\" God's message in his Son (Guthrie, 1983, 80). The answer to the rhetorical question in verse 3\u2014\"How shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation?\"\u2014is obvious: No escape is possible. In Hebrews \"salvation\" (soteria) was promised by the Old Testament prophets (1:1), is fulfilled by Jesus in the present time (2:3, 10; 5:9), and will be consummated in his future coming (cf. 1:14; 6:9; 9:28; see TDNT, 7:989\u20131012). ... The emphasis here and elsewhere in Hebrews [with the phrase \"how shall we escape\"] is on the inescapable, terrible, and eternal consequences for apostasy (cf. 6:4\u20136; 10:26\u201331). The first steps in that catastrophic direction occur when Christians drift away from Christ (2:1) and ignore God's glorious salvation in his Son (2:3a). The author identifies his readers as fellow believers by using the pronoun \"we\" in 2:1, 3a and \"us\" in 2:3. As I. Howard Marshall points out, the warning addresses \"people who have heard the gospel and responded to it. At no point in the Epistle is it warrantable to assume that the readers originally addressed by the author are not Christians\" (1969, 139). By using the preacher's \"we,\" our author not only identifies the readers as believers, but also includes himself and all other believers in the same warning (cf. 3:6, 14; 10:26\u201327; 12:25).J.

To matriculate, Bennett spent his first year obtaining a Certificate in Biblical Knowledge from the University and two 'A levels' (in Religious Studies and British Constitution and Politics) from the Joint Matriculation Board (JMB). At University Bennett was politically active through the Liberal Society. He was Treasurer of the Baptist-United Reformed Church Society, served on the Chaplaincy committee and as Secretary of the Theological Society. In this capacity, he invited such theologians as Maurice Wiles, I. Howard Marshall, Morna Hooker and others to address the Society, whose members included Faculty alongside students. For the last six months of his final year he was Baptist Student Leader at the College (where Methodists were also training for ministry). He graduated in July 1978 and was ordained as a minister of the Baptist Union of Great Britain the same month. Accepted for service with the Baptist Missionary Society, Bennett spent an academic year at the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham where he undertook missionary orientation.  He was most influenced by Lesslie Newbigin, who taught missiology.Bennett was to work with Newbigin on various committees of the Birmingham Council of Christian Churches between 1983 and 1992.  Newbigin was a Vice-President. In July 1979, Bennett obtained a Certificate in the Study of Islam from the University of Birmingham through the Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations before proceeding to Bangladesh, where he remained until 1982 engaged in pastoral care and distance education teaching as a tutor for the College of Christian Theology Bangladesh (CCTB).  He passed the Junior and Senior level Bengali examinations of the Bangladesh Language Examination Board.  Although he completed several units of a master's degree by distance learning from Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, CA he was unable to complete the residential component because of the cost. When the BMS chose not to support his plan to enroll for an MA at a College in Bangladesh, he returned to Birmingham, graduating MA in 1985 and PhD in 1990. Both research degrees were in Islamic Studies under the supervision of David Kerr and Christian W. Troll, SJ. His external examiners were Jan Slomp and Clifford Edmund Bosworth.  Bennett's doctoral thesis was subsequently published as Victorian Images of Islam (1992) (in the CSIC Studies on Islam and Christianity series). In 1985, Bennett also passed the Bengali 'O Level' (London) achieving an 'A' grade. In 1996, Bennett graduated from the University of Oxford with the MEd through Westminster College, Oxford where he was teaching at the time. In 1994 he had completed the Certificate of Professional Studies in Education from the University's Delegacy of Local Examinations also through Westminster.This information is taken from Contemporary Authors, Vol. 157-page 20 and from Bennett's from Clinton Bennett's Curriculum Vitae at Biodata."]}]}}
