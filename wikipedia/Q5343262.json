Cricket websites agree that he batted right-handed, but do not indicate a bowling style: however, the record of a Somerset Second Eleven match from 1939 in which Hack took wickets suggests that he may have been an all-rounder. In his one first-class match, he did not bowl. A book published in 2017 states that Hack was regarded in his club cricket career for Clevedon Cricket Club primarily as a batsman, and often opened the batting, but he did also bowl and, on occasion, he kept wicket.", "link_mentions": {}}}
