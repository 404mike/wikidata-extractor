When he left school in 1968, he joined Birmingham City as an apprentice, and turned professional two years later. A pacey full back, he spent a long time in the reserve team before eventually making his debut in the First Division on 16 August 1975, the opening game of the 1975\u201376 season, in a 3\u20133 draw at Leicester City. Osborne played a few more games that season, deputising for Ray Martin who was nearing the end of his Birmingham career, but his defending was not considered up to standard and he was allowed to leave. He then spent a season with Port Vale where he played the opening six games of the season for the Third Division side. After losing his place in September 1976 he didn't get another game until April the next year, though he did play nine of the last ten games. He left on a free transfer in May 1977, moving into non-league football with Hillingdon Borough and Westfields.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Sproson", "response": ["For the 1976\u201377 season he was forced to sell Terry Lees to Sparta Rotterdam for \u00a325,000 (representing a \u00a322,000 profit in the space of twelve months). He added to his squad with youngsters Ian Osborne and Kevin Kennerley, and experienced midfielder Geoff Davies. After Cullerton suffered a cartilage injury he signed Ken Beamish for a \u00a312,000 fee from Blackburn Rovers, as well as former Wigan Athletic forward John Rogers for 'a small fee'. His team struggled with poor discipline \u2013 Rotherham manager Jimmy McGuigan claimed Vale were 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Midway through the season Sproson sold two more key players: striker Ray Williams went into non-league football for 'a small fee' and midfielder Colin Tartt joined Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. Sproson brought in Alan Lamb from Preston North End and Peter Sutcliffe from Stockport County for a combined outlay of \u00a38,000. Ultimately though, the loss of star midfielder Brian Horton to Brighton for \u00a330,000 in March 1976 was something Sproson proved unable to remedy. Nevertheless, relegation was narrowly avoided at the end of 1976\u201377, as his side finished nineteenth, three points above the drop."]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["The small squad barely changed for 1976\u201377; Kevin Kennerley and Ian Osborne replacing an outgoing Geoff Morris. The FA slapped the club with a \u00a3400 fine for poor discipline, the club therefore began fining players for unacceptable behaviour on the pitch. Terry Lees was sold to Sparta Rotterdam for \u00a325,000. \u00a312,000 of this money was spent on striker Ken Beamish. Former England international Bobby Thomson was also brought in and quickly made captain. The club continued in their physical footballing ways, opposition manager Jimmy McGuigan describing it as 'the worst example of football thuggery I have ever seen' and Burnley captain Peter Noble calling Vale 'a bunch of kickers'. In the FA Cup they lost at the Fifth Round to a crowd of nearly 50,000 at Villa Park. In the league they clung on to their third tier status, safe by only three points.", "Before the 1977\u201378 season began, Tommy McLaren was released, as was Eric Skeels, Ian Osborne and coach Roy Chapman. David Harris also refused a new contract, for the same reason Sammy Morgan's \u00a312,000 return did not go through. The club's hierarchy displayed their dissatisfaction with manager Roy Sproson. He was sacked in October and never returned to Vale Park. After a spell under caretaker-manager Colin Harper, ex-Bury manager Bobby Smith was appointed to the job. He made Dennis Butler his assistant. In January, Neville Chamberlain became the club's first black professional. Colchester United's John Froggatt was also brought in for \u00a310,000. Frugal spending out of the window, the club still almost managed to break even.

The battle with Stoke-on-Trent City Council continued over the legality of Vale's market trading operation. The club were also in trouble with The Football Association, who fined them \u00a3400 for the 47 bookings received in the previous campaign. Vale decided to crack down on player indiscipline by fining players \u00a325 for dissent and \u00a350 for violence. As 'a piece of good business' which 'could not be turned down', the club also sold star defender Terry Lees to Dutch side Sparta Rotterdam for \u00a325,000.
