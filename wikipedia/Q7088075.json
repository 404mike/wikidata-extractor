She tries to be a typical warm-hearted Irish mother, but she quickly gets frustrated with her family. She openly resents Da, who makes fun of her short stature, and she refers to as a \"lanky streak of piss\". While she keeps wishing ill of her husband, she is hurt any time he takes interest in other women. She is uninterested in politics and finds sectarianism to be dumb. This allows her to be accepting of things and people that Da and Cal are less open to, particularly her protestant in-laws. She has the occasional mild crush on Uncle Andy. Multiple episodes revealed that she has obsessions with various celebrities, but the identity of that person keeps changing (e.g. they have included Daniel O'Donnell and Hugo Duncan. She recently learned that she wasn't legally married to Da, but they did marry after Cal tricked Da into it. She also revealed that she is actually a British citizen by birth, and has only ever had British identification documents, which aggravates Da no end."]}, {"page": "2006 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Olivia Nash, Actress.
