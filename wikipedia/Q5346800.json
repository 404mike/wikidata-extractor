In the spring of 1917 he joined the Royal Artillery and was posted to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. He also served in the Jewish Legion. After the First World War he joined the Mandatory Government in Palestine, and was the last mandate-era director of the Palestine Broadcasting Service.\nAs a viscount, he served as a peer in the House of Lords. One of his significant acts was to have the law that forbade marriage between a woman and her brother-in-law repealed. His explicit intent was to allow a man to fulfil his responsibility under the Judaic Biblical law of levirate marriage, as described in the Book of Deuteronomy, whereby the brother of a man who dies childless must marry the widow.\nLord Samuel was the initiator of the Knesset Menorah project which eventually led to the huge bronze candelabrum presented by the British parliament to the State of Israel in 1956.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["***Edwin Samuel, 2nd Viscount Samuel (1898\u20131978), son of the 1st Viscount.
