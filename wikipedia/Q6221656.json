Moore turned his attention to her sister Elizabeth whom he married soon after. Mary Ann married in her sixteenth year John R.

(The youngest sister Ann married William Murray, the brother of Harriet Murray), but died soon after the marriage.) John Duff had been a classmate of Moore at Trinity College, where he had read law, but was drawn to the stage. He was seen in Dublin by actor Thomas Apthorpe Cooper who recommended him to Powell and Dickson of the Boston Theatre. He was immediately engaged and he and Mary, barely sixteen, moved to America in 1810. In 1817, John became a partner in the Boston Theatre but relinquished his share after three years.Abel Bowen (1888) Bowen's Picture of Boston, Otis, Broaders and Company, Boston", "Mary Ann Duff first appeared in Boston as Juliet on 31 December 1810 with her husband as Romeo. The part of Mercutio was played by John Bernard. Although one critic remarked on her attractiveness, he felt that her youth made her lack experience and conception.", "Her next performance was on 3 January 1811, where she played Lady Anne in Richard III with George Frederick Cooke in the title r\u00f4le. She followed it with Lady Rodolpha Lumbercourt to his Sir Pertinax MacSycophant in Charles Macklin's Man of the World; Charlotte to his Sir Archy MacSarcasm in Love a la Mode by the same author; and Lady Percy to his Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1. Other roles she played at this time were Miranda, with her husband as Marplot, in The Busy Bodie by Susanna Centlivre; and Eliza Ratcliff, with John Bernard as Sheva, in The Jew by Richard Cumberland. She also appeared in the pantomimes Oscar and Malvina by William Reeve, in which she also danced; and Brazen Mask by James Hewitt. On 29 April 1811 the Duffs appeared at a benefit in which Mary danced a solo while her husband performed in The Three and the Deuce by Prince Hoare. The latter was so popular that he would go on to repeat this triple-role performance more than eighty times over the course of his career. Mary's first season in Boston ended with her playing Victoria in Hannah Cowley's A Bold Stroke for a Husband."]}, {"page": "John Bernard", "response": ["John Bernard may refer to:", "*John Bernard (MP for New Shoreham), MP for New Shoreham 1337\u20131368", "*John Bernard (MP for Hythe), MP for Hythe, 1378\u20131386", "*John Bernard (MP for Wallingford), MP for Wallingford, 1388", "*John Bernard (Ipswich MP) (died 1421), MP for Ipswich, 1387\u20131411", "*John Bernard (MP for Northallerton) (1604\u20131674), English landowner", "*Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet (1630\u20131679), MP for Huntingdon, 1660", "*John Bernard (American politician) (1893\u20131983), U.S. congressman from Minnesota", "*John Bernard (author) (died 1554), religious writer", "*John Bernard, Count of Lippe (1613\u20131652)", "*John Bernard (bishop) (1860\u20131927), Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, Irish", "*John Bernard (actor) (1756\u20131828), English actor and biographer"]}, {"page": "William Bayle Bernard", "response": ["William Bayle Bernard (27 November 1807 \u2013 5 August 1875), often referred to as \"Bayle Bernard\", was a well-known American-born London playwright and drama critic.
