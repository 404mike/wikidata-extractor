She was also Director of the British Leather Manufacturers' Research Association. She was the first to propose that the structure of globular proteins was maintained by hydrogen bonds, an idea championed later by Linus Pauling and others.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "King Edward VI High School for Girls", "response": ["*Dorothy Jordan Lloyd, protein scientist"]}, {"page": "Cyclol", "response": ["Since protein structure was so poorly understood in the 1930s, the physical interactions responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown.  Astbury hypothesized that the structure of fibrous proteins was stabilized by hydrogen bonds in \u03b2-sheets.  The idea that globular proteins are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by Dorothy Jordan Lloyd in 1932, and championed later by Alfred Mirsky and Linus Pauling.  At a 1933 lecture by Astbury to the Oxford Junior Scientific Society, physicist Frederick Frank suggested that the fibrous protein \u03b1-keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism, namely, covalent crosslinking of the peptide bonds by the cyclol reaction above.  The cyclol crosslink draws the two peptide groups close together; the N and C atoms are separated by ~1.5\u00a0\u00c5, whereas they are separated by ~3\u00a0\u00c5 in a typical hydrogen bond.  The idea intrigued J. D. Bernal, who suggested it to the mathematician Dorothy Wrinch as possibly useful in understanding protein structure.", "From the beginning, the cyclol reaction was considered as a covalent analog of the hydrogen bond.  Therefore, it was natural to consider hybrid models with both types of bonds.  This was the subject of Wrinch's fourth paper on the cyclol model (1936), written together with Dorothy Jordan Lloyd, who first proposed that globular proteins are stabilized by hydrogen bonds.  A follow-up paper was written in 1937 that referenced other researchers on hydrogen bonding in proteins, such as Maurice Loyal Huggins and Linus Pauling."]}, {"page": "Dorothy Jordan-Lloyd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dorothy Jordan Lloyd"]}, {"page": "Dorothy Jordan", "response": ["* Dorothy Jordan Lloyd (1890\u20131946), British scientist"]}, {"page": "Cresswell Shearer", "response": ["Cresswell Shearer, FRS (24 May 1874  \u2013 6 February 1941), was a British zoologist and Cambridge lecturer in Experimental Embryology, where he motivated his students to develop a keen interest in hands-on research, inviting them to practical marine research experience at Plymouth Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom during the summer months.
