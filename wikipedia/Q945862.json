He mistook the star for 26 Aurigae, although he noted to himself that it seemed brighter than he remembered it being.  He saw it twice more during the following week.   On 31 January 1892 he realized his mistake, and wrote a note to Ralph Copeland (the Astronomer Royal of Scotland) reporting his discovery.   Professor Copeland immediately reported the discovery via telegram to William Huggins, who made the first spectroscopic observations of T Aurigae on 2 February 1892, when the star was a magnitude 4.5 object.
