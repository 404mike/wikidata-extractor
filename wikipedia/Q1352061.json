His first book The Innocent Anthropologist (1983), was an account of field work in Cameroon and was positively reviewed. \nHe later conducted field work in Indonesia. Since 2003 he has expanded his writing career. He divides his time between the United Kingdom and Indonesia. His book Not a Hazardous Sport (1989) was about his research in Tana Toraja. He has since written numerous other works, including fiction. He wrote a historical novel Island of Demons (2009), loosely based on the German artist Walter Spies, who lived for most of his career in Bali.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of anthropologists", "response": ["*Nigel Barley"]}, {"page": "Walter Spies", "response": ["*Anthropologist Nigel Barley wrote a novel Island of Demons (2009), loosely based on Spies's life.
