From 1 January 1873 he worked for the Department of Antiquities, and was foreman of masons from 1894. He undertook many highly skilled tasks, not only for the Department of Antiquities but also for other areas of the British Museum. He played a significant role in situating fragments of the Elgin Marbles, and also advised during the construction of the model of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. Alexander Stuart Murray commented that Pinker's work was \"more appropriate to a sculptor's assistant than to a mason.\" He retired on 5 April 1932, due to failing health. Two days before his death, he was granted an OBE in the 1932 Birthday Honours by King George V. Pinker died on 3 June 1932, at the age of 85. His life was the subject of an obituary in The Times."]}, {"page": "List of keepers of the British Museum", "response": ["* 1886\u20131904: Alexander Stuart Murray"]}]}}
