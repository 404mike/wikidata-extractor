It was shot in black-and-white and featured make-up work by Christopher Tucker.", "For his second feature and first studio film albeit independently financed, Lynch provided the musical direction and sound design. Lynch tried to design the make-up himself too, but the design didn't work. The makeup, now supervised by Christopher Tucker, was directly designed from casts of Merrick's body, which had been kept in the Royal London Hospital's private museum. The makeup took seven to eight hours to apply each day and two hours to delicately remove. John Hurt would arrive on set at 5am and shoot his scenes from noon until 10pm. When Hurt was having his first experiences with the inconveniences of applying makeup and having to perform with it, he called his girlfriend, saying, \"I think they finally managed to make me hate acting.\""]}, {"page": "Mr Creosote", "response": ["Jones was transformed into Mr. Creosote by British prosthetic make-up artist Christopher Tucker, who also created the prosthetic effects for the American film drama The Elephant Man (1980)."]}, {"page": "The Company of Wolves", "response": ["**Best Make Up Artist (Jane Royle, Christopher Tucker)", "**Best Special Visual Effects (Christopher Tucker, Alan Whibley)."]}, {"page": "53rd Academy Awards", "response": ["The 53rd Academy Awards, honoring the best in film for 1980, were presented March 31, 1981, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles.

The lack of recognition for Christopher Tucker's make-up work on The Elephant Man prompted the creation of the Academy Award for Best Makeup the following year. Henry Fonda was awarded an Academy Honorary Award during this ceremony. He received the Academy Award for Best Actor the following year.

Mollo worked with George Lucas to compile a chart of visual designs for a range of character types. In collaboration with Mollo, make-up artist Stuart Freeborn designed the masks and prosthetics to match each of the costumes, along with Doug Beswick, Rick Baker, Phil Tippett, Nick Maley and Christopher Tucker. Freeborn has remarked that the cantina scene was specifically set up to be a \"shock\" scene; until this point in the film, there had been few appearances of non-human creatures, and the entrance into the cantina suddenly presented the audience with an array of outlandish species. Working from Lucas's direction and a maquette, set designer John Barry created the cantina set complete with circular bar and shady alcoves. Mollo included a few costumes borrowed from Westerns, and based some other costumes on characters from the 1950 film Destination Moon and the 1960s television series Lost in Space. The alien musicians in the band were played by a number of the Industrial Light & Magic crew, including Phil Tippett, Jon Berg, Rick Baker, who all mimed to the Benny Goodman tune \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" at George Lucas's suggestion."]}, {"page": "Catherine Tucker", "response": ["Catherine Tucker was born in Oxford, and attended Merton College at the University of Oxford, studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics.
