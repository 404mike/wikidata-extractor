Keogh later came first with her solo flute performance at the 1939 Dublin Feis Ceoil. From 1944, Keogh played with the Radio \u00c9ireann Orchestra and from 1948 Radio \u00c9ireann Symphony Orchestra and the Radio \u00c9ireann Light Orchestra. She was irritated that women members were paid less than men and campaigned for pay equality. In the 1950s, she focused on raising her family but returned increasingly to work as a freelance musician from the 1960s. She also taught flute at the Royal Irish Academy of Music from 1969. Her pupils included Nicola Lindsay and composers John Buckley and Fergus Johnston."]}]}}
