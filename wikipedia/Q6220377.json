Polanyi noted what had happened to the study of genetics in the Soviet Union once the doctrines of Trofim Lysenko had gained the backing of the State. Demands in Britain, for example by the Marxist John Desmond Bernal, for centrally planned scientific research led Polanyi to defend the claim that science requires free debate.

Perhaps the most significant was Edmund Brisco Ford, who founded a field of research called ecological genetics, which played a role in the evolutionary synthesis. Another important disciple was Gavin de Beer, who wrote on evolution and development, and became Director of the Natural History Museum. Both these fine scholars had attended Huxley's lectures on genetics, experimental zoology (including embryology) and ethology. Later, they became his collaborators, and then leaders in their own right."]}, {"page": "John (given name)", "response": ["*John Baker (fl.1388), English Member of Parliament (MP) for Horsham, 1388", "*John Baker (died 1406), English MP for Southwark, 1406", "*John Baker (fl. 1407), English MP for Lyme Regis, 1407", "*John Baker (MP for Lewes), see Lewes", "*John Baker (died c.1421), English MP for Helston, 1414", "*John Baker (fl. 1421), English MP for Devizes, 1421", "*John Baker (died 1544) (by 1503\u201344), English MP for Radnorshire", "*Sir John Baker (died 1558) (1488\u20131558), English speaker of the House of Commons", "*John Baker (MP for Bedford) (by 1501\u20131538 or later), English mayor and MP of Bedford", "*John Baker (by 1531\u20131604/6), English MP for Horsham and Bramber", "*John Baker (MP for East Grinstead), English MP for East Grinstead in 1648", "*John Baker (MP for Canterbury) ( \u2013 1831), British MP for Canterbury", "*John Baker (representative) (1769\u20131823), United States congressman from Virginia", "*John Baker (Baker Brook) (1796\u20131868), Canadian political activist in Baker Brook, New Brunswick", "*John Baker (Australian politician) (1813\u20131872), briefly the Premier of South Australia", "*Sir John Baker (Portsmouth MP) (1828\u20131909), British MP for Portsmouth", "*John Baker (Labour politician) (1867\u20131939), British Labour MP for Bilston", "*John Baker (Wisconsin politician) (1869\u20131???), American politician from Wisconsin", "*John Baker (defensive lineman, born 1935) (1935\u20132007), American football player and then sheriff of Wake County, North Carolina", "*John Baker (Indiana politician) (1832\u20131915), United States congressman from Indiana", "*Sir John Baker, 2nd Baronet (1608\u20131653), English politician", "*John Baker II (1780\u20131843), sheriff of Norfolk County, Massachusetts, 1834\u20131843", "*John Baker (American Revolutionary War) (1731\u20131787), American Revolutionary War hero, for whom Baker County, Georgia was named", "*John Baker (RAF officer) (1897\u20131978), British air marshal", "*John Baker (general) (1936\u20132007), Australian Chief of the Defence Force", "*John Baker (Royal Navy officer) (1660\u20131716), English naval officer, MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis", "*John Baker (Medal of Honor, 1876) (1853\u20131???), American soldier", "*John Baker (biologist) (1900\u20131984), British biologist and anthropologist", "*John Baker, Baron Baker (1901\u20131985), British engineer", "*John Baker (author) (born 1942), British novelist", "*John Baker (legal historian) (born 1944), English legal historian, Downing Professor of the Laws of England, University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Academic freedom", "response": ["In 1936, as a consequence of an invitation to give lectures for the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the USSR, Polanyi met Bukharin, who told him that in socialist societies all scientific research is directed to accord with the needs of the latest five-year plan.

He developed a keen interest in the Botanic Garden, going on to establish the 'Genetic Garden'. He was also involved in extending the teaching of science, especially genetics, in the university. He voiced strong support for hereditarians in an increasingly hostile academic environment. In 1972 he, along with 50 other prominent scientists signed \"Resolution on Scientific Freedom Regarding Human Behavior and Heredity\" in which a genetic approach to understanding the behaviour of man was strongly defended. He staunchly defended his colleague in the fight against Lysenkoism, John Baker, who published the controversial book \"Race\" in 1974. Races are, according to Baker (and Darlington), breeding populations with demarcations drawn at whatever level of detail is required for the problem at hand. Asked by a reporter for the Sunday times whether or not he was a racist, Darlington replied: \"Well, I'm regarded as one by everyone except the Jews, who are racist, and who utterly agree with my views.\""]}, {"page": "John Baker", "response": ["John Baker or Jon Baker may refer to:", "*John Baker (American Revolutionary War) (1731\u20131787), American Revolutionary War hero, for whom Baker County, Georgia was named", "*John Baker (RAF officer) (1897\u20131978), British air marshal", "*John Baker (general) (1936\u20132007), Australian Chief of the Defence Force", "*John Baker (Royal Navy officer) (1660\u20131716), English naval officer, MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis", "*John Baker (Medal of Honor, 1876) (1853\u2013?), American soldier", "*John Baker (fl.1388), English Member of Parliament (MP) for Horsham, 1388", "*John Baker (died 1406), English MP for Southwark, 1406", "*John Baker (fl. 1407), English MP for Lyme Regis, 1407", "*John Baker (MP for Lewes), see Lewes", "*John Baker (died c.1421), English MP for Helston, 1414", "*John Baker (fl. 1421), English MP for Devizes, 1421", "*John Baker (died 1544) (by 1503-44), English MP for Radnorshire", "*Sir John Baker (died 1558) (1488\u20131558), English speaker of the House of Commons", "*John Baker (MP for Bedford) (by 1501\u20131538 or later), English mayor and MP of Bedford", "*John Baker (by 1531\u20131604/6), English MP for Horsham and Bramber", "*John Baker (MP for East Grinstead), English MP for East Grinstead in 1648", "*John Baker (MP for Canterbury) (c. 1754\u20131831), British MP for Canterbury", "*John Baker (representative) (1769\u20131823), United States congressman from Virginia", "*John Baker (Baker Brook) (1796\u20131868), Canadian political activist in Baker Brook, New Brunswick", "*John Baker (Australian politician) (1813\u20131872), briefly the Premier of South Australia", "*Sir John Baker (Portsmouth MP) (1828\u20131909), British MP for Portsmouth", "*John Baker (Labour politician) (1867\u20131939), British Labour MP for Bilston", "*John Baker (Wisconsin politician) (1869\u2013?), American politician from Wisconsin", "*John Baker (defensive lineman, born 1935) (1935\u20132007), American professional football player and then sheriff of Wake County, North Carolina", "*John Baker (Indiana politician) (1832\u20131915), United States congressman from Indiana", "*Sir John Baker, 2nd Baronet (1608\u20131653), English politician", "*John Baker II (1780\u20131843), sheriff of Norfolk County, Massachusetts, 1834\u20131843", "* John Baker (defensive lineman, born 1935) (1935\u20132007), professional football player, sheriff of Wake County, North Carolina ", "* John Baker (defensive lineman, born 1942), American and Canadian football defensive end", "* John Baker (punter) (born 1977), American football punter", "* John Baker (baseball) (born 1981), American baseball player", "*John Baker (Australian footballer) (1918\u20131988), Australian rules footballer for North Melbourne", "* John Baker (cricketer) (born 1933), former English cricketer", "* John Baker (Ghanaian footballer), Ghanaian international footballer in squad that won 1982 African Cup for the fourth time", "* John Baker (musher) (born 1962/3), American dogsled racer", "* John Baker (runner) (1944\u20131970), American cross-country runner", "*John Baker (rugby league), Australian rugby league footballer", "*John Baker (diver), British diver", "*John Baker (Radiophonic musician) (1937\u20131997), British composer and musician", "*John Baker, British musician and member of The Korgis (active since 1978)", "*John Baker, composer for ToeJam & Earl (1991-1994)", "*John Baker (biologist) (1900\u20131984), British biologist and anthropologist", "*John Baker, Baron Baker (1901\u20131985), British engineer", "*John Baker (author) (born 1942), British novelist", "*John Baker (legal historian) (born 1944), English legal historian, Downing Professor of the Laws of England, University of Cambridge", "*John Baker (bishop) (1928\u20132014), Bishop of Salisbury", "*John Baker (priest) (died 1745), English Anglican vice-master of Trinity College, Cambridge", "*John Baker (barrister) (1711\u20131779), English barrister, Solicitor-General of the Leeward Islands (1750\u20131753) and Diarist.", "*John Baker (artist) (1726\u20131771), English flower painter", "*John Baker (entrepreneur) (born 1976), Canadian businessman, founder and president of Desire2Learn", "*John Baker White (clerk of court) (1794\u20131862), American military officer, lawyer, court clerk, and civil servant", "*John Baker White (West Virginia politician) (1868\u20131944), American military officer, lawyer, and politician in West Virginia", "*John Baker White (British politician) (1902\u20131988), British politician"]}]}}
