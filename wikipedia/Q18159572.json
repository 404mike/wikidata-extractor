His opponent was Northern Ireland boxer Gordon Ferris, who had taken the belt from Billy Aird in March that year. The fight, shown live on British television, lasted less than a round. The contest began slowly, with both boxers trading searching shots at range with little contact made. With just less than thirty seconds to go before the bell Meade connected with a left jab to Ferris left temple; as Ferris recovered and began moving back into position, Meade was already following up with a right hand hook. Meade's hook landed on the left side of Ferris' jaw and Ferris dropped to the canvas. The referee began the count but quickly realised that the prone Ferris would not recover and so ended the fight, making Meade the new British Heavyweight champion.", "|align=left| Gordon Ferris"]}, {"page": "Finlay Bealham", "response": ["Finlay Bealham (born 9 October 1991) is an Australian-born Irish rugby union player.
