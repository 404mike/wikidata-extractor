The opening track \"Bird Song\" was written by Lovich and Les Chappell. When Lovich woke up in the night from a dream, she recorded different sounds on a tape recorder. The recording later served as an inspiration for the song, where at the beginning she mimics the sounds of birds. \"What Will I Do Without You?\" is a song written especially for the album by Judge Smith. Another song written by him appears on the album, \"You Can't Kill Me\", which he had already written in 1972. It deals with reincarnation. \"Angels\" is a song dedicated to people who like to live dangerously. Lovich spoke on people who do dangerous jobs and that they serve as an inspiration to other people. She also said, working in the music industry can be sometimes mentally damaging, but is also a good recreation. \"The Night\" is a cover of The Four Seasons' song.
