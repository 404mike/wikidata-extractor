Within a year he had published his first book, Guide To The  Botanic Garden Cambridge (1922), followed by his Descriptive Labels for Botanic Gardens (1924). The gardens were much depleted, because of the war but his friendship with Reginald Cory, a fellow alumnus, resulted in considerable funding including the building of Cory Lodge as a residence for the Director.Amongst his students, Donald Piggott, would later become a professor in the Botany School, and director of the garden (1984\u20131995). Gilbert-Carter is remembered by the Gilbert Carter Woodland in the Garden.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William T. Stearn", "response": ["Stearn was largely self-educated and his widowed mother worked hard to support him while at school but could not afford a university education for him, there being no grants available then. When not at the Botany School, he attended evening classes to develop linguistic and bibliographic skills. His classes there included German and the classics. He obtained his first employment at the age of 18 in 1929, a time of high unemployment, to support himself and his family. He worked as an apprentice antiquarian bookseller and cataloguer in the second-hand section at Bowes & Bowes bookshop, 1 Trinity Street (now Cambridge University Press), between 1929 and 1933 where he was able to pursue his passion for bibliography. During his employment there, he spent much of his lunchtimes, evenings and weekends, at the Botany School and Botanic Garden. This was at a time when botany was thriving at Cambridge under the leadership of Seward and Humphrey Gilbert-Carter.", "While working at the bookshop he made many friends among the Cambridge botanists and participated in their activities, including botanical excursions. In addition to Professor Seward, those influencing him included the morphologist Agnes Arber, Humphrey Gilbert-Carter the first scientific director of the Botanic Garden, John Gilmour then curator of the university herbarium and later director of the Garden (1951\u20131973), the horticulturalist E. A. Bowles (1865\u20131954), who became his patron, Harry Godwin, then a research fellow and later professor and Tom Tutin who was working with Seward at that time. Seward gave him full research facilities in the herbarium. He continued his research, visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in 1930, at the age of 19, and also spent two weeks at the herbarium of the Mus\u00e9e National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, with the aid of a \u00a315 grant from the Royal Society to study Epimedium. Also in 1930, the Fifth International Botanical Congress was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend. During this time he commuted between the bookshop, the Botany School, Botanic Garden and home by bicycle, his preferred means of transportation throughout his life."]}, {"page": "John Gilmour (botanist)", "response": ["On returning to Cambridge, Gilmour succeeded Humphrey Gilbert-Carter as director in 1951, he was an important force in the development of the Eastern Garden, once the Cory Fund monies became available, and the Cory Laboratory and glasshouses were constructed in 1957. His scientific contributions were largely in the field of systematics and horticulture, playing an important role in the Systematics Association. When he retired in 1973 he was succeeded by Max Walters."]}, {"page": "H.

Forming a friendship with the latter he was persuaded to spend the summer of 1949 in Uppsala and Helsinki universities where he was impressed by the mapping of the Scandinavian flora and returned to work with Walters on similar projects for the British Isles and used this method in his PhD thesis on Thyme. Under Professor Harry Godwin he also worked on the design of the Botanic Garden's ecological mound."]}, {"page": "Frederick George Preston", "response": ["In 1904, he entered Kew Gardens as a student-gardener, where he remained until 1909.
