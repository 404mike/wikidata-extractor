This was denied by several hunger strikers and Brendan McFarlane, who was OC inside the prison during the hunger strike. McFarlane states O'Rawe's version of events is confused and fragmentary, and states \"We were desperate for a solution. Any deal that went some way to meeting the five demands would have been taken.
