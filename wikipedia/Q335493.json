He served as Viceroy of India between 1876 and 1880\u2014during his tenure Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India\u2014and as British Ambassador to France from 1887 to 1891.\nHis tenure as Viceroy was controversial for its ruthlessness in both domestic and foreign affairs: especially for his handling of the Great Famine of 1876\u201378, and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Lytton's policies were alleged to be informed by his Social Darwinism. His son Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, who was born in India, later served as Governor of Bengal and briefly as acting Viceroy.  The senior earl was also the father-in-law of the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed New Delhi.\nLytton was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Benjamin Disraeli in domestic affairs, and of Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, who was his predecessor as Ambassador to France, in foreign affairs. His tenure as Ambassador to Paris was successful, and Lytton was afforded the rare tribute \u2013 especially for an Englishman \u2013 of a French state funeral in Paris.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 8", "response": ["*1831 \u2013 Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton, English poet and diplomat, 30th Governor-General of India (d. 1880)"]}]}}
