He has worked on many big-budget films and was nominated for an Emmy Award for his cinematography on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series. Three of his most noted collaborations include having worked with film directors George Lucas, Frank Darabont and Martin Campbell.\nTattersall studied at Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School for Boys before moving on to Goldsmiths College in London, receiving a first class BA in Fine Arts. He went on to study at Britain's National Film and Television School at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.The first film Tattersall worked on was Salette in 1986.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Wachowskis", "response": ["The Wachowskis returned to directing with Speed Racer (2008) which starred Emile Hirsch. The film, which was again produced by Silver, was an adaptation of a 1960s Japanese manga series originally called Mach GoGoGo, which had previously been adapted as an anime television series in 1967. The Wachowskis were attracted to the project because the series was the first anime they had watched, and they wanted to make a family-friendly film for their nieces and nephews to enjoy. In an effort to simulate the look of anime in live action, the Wachowskis had cinematographer David Tattersall shoot the movie digitally on a digital backlot with the intention of adding extensive visual effects in post-production. The movie was considered a critical and commercial failure. While its special effects were noted as outstanding, the storyline is considered lacking. It was nominated in the category of \"Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel\" for the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards. Its box office gross was $93\u00a0million compared to a production budget of $120\u00a0million. Since then, critics periodically have put the film on lists of underrated or cult films."]}, {"page": "Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace", "response": ["A binder with the film's storyboards served as a reference for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed in front of a chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds, or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tattersall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists."]}, {"page": "1960 in television", "response": ["| David Tattersall"]}, {"page": "National Film and Television School", "response": ["* David Tattersall (Die Another Day,  Star Wars \u2013 Episodes I, II and III)"]}, {"page": "Frank Darabont", "response": ["In addition to collaborating with actors on films and television projects, Darabont has collaborated with writers, producers, composers, and others.
