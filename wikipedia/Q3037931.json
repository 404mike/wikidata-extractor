His first quality was his mobility; he was an example to young back-row players in the way he kept close to the ball and in his anticipation of the run of play. It brought him one notable Test try in South Africa when he gathered a cross-kick to surge over the line. He was one of the last forwards to be a notably good dribbler of the ball.\""]}, {"page": "Scottish Sports Hall of Fame", "response": ["*Douglas Elliot (1923\u20132005)"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh Academical Football Club", "response": ["*  Douglas Elliot"]}, {"page": "Allan Massie", "response": ["* Forwards: Hugh McLeod, Colin Deans, Sandy Carmichael, Gordon Brown, Alastair McHarg, Douglas Elliot, Jim Telfer (captain), David Leslie"]}, {"page": "Rugby union in Scotland", "response": ["*Douglas Elliot"]}, {"page": "Doug Elliot", "response": ["#REDIRECTDouglas Elliot"]}, {"page": "History of rugby union in Scotland", "response": ["*Douglas Elliot"]}, {"page": "WID Elliot", "response": ["#REDIRECT Douglas Elliot"]}, {"page": "W.I.D.
