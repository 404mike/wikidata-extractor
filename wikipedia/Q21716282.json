Time editor-at-large Michael J. Elliott defended the decision to consistently exclude Blair, saying that \"Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Jacques Chirac are not there either. This is a worldwide list. There are no Western European political leaders on it because they are not that powerful or influential at this time\". Although George W. Bush has been on the list several times, controversy emerged when he was dropped from the list in 2007 in part because of the Democratic victory in the 2006 congressional election. Former Senator Rick Santorum (R\u2013PA) said on Fox News:The fact of the matter is, the president of the United States, I don't care who's in that office, is the most powerful man on the face of the Earth and has more influence over various aspects of lives, not just in this country, but around the world. And for Time magazine to dismiss that just shows you how biased and, I would argue, hateful they are."]}, {"page": "Michael Elliott", "response": ["* Michael J.
