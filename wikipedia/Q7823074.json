People such as Terry Harkin, Tony O'Doherty, Eamon McLaughlin and Eddie Mahon, having worked on the visionary project since 1983, helped in the bid to secure senior status once again for Derry City with an election to the League of Ireland's First Division in May 1985. However, the IFA still saw the chance to thwart Derry City once again. The FIFA vice-president (also the IFA's president), Harry Cavan, who had been instrumental in banning the Brandywell from being used for European competition in 1964, claimed that FIFA rules did not permit Derry crossing the border to play in the league of another country. In Dublin, people were undecided about admitting a club from a city with a recent history of political problems but the Finn Harps chairman, Fran Fields, fully backed Derry's application and Glentoran chairman, John Crossen, was another prominent supporter of Derry's move as he felt that the time had come for the IFA to refrain from acting as they had done previously. Others within the Irish League were also in favour of Derry's move as they no longer wanted to have to deal with the club's annual application for re-election to the Irish League.", "With no further hurdles standing in the way, Derry City joined the Republic's league, the League of Ireland, in the newly created League of Ireland First Division in 1985 as a semi-professional outfit (although they did adopt professional football while Noel King was in charge between late-1985 and 1987). However, if they thought that this would provide an escape from the marginalisation and sectarian politics in Northern Irish football, they would have to think again \u2013 Derry's supporters' buses often came under attack from sectarian gangs with stones and other missiles as they travelled through loyalist areas en route to away games in the Republic of Ireland. On occasion, buses still take a detour in order to avoid potential trouble-spots \u2013 especially on the days of high-profile games. Nevertheless, the city responded in their thousands. Jim Crossan had been appointed manager and he made Terry Kelly his team-captain. Derry's first match in the League of Ireland was played at the Brandywell on 8 September 1985 and saw Derry beat Home Farm of Dublin by a score of 3\u20131.\"Derry City 3 \u2013 1 Home Farm \", CityWeb, 2007. The game itself was actually played as part of the League Cup. Barry McCreadie was Derry's first goal-scorer that day. The club's first League of Ireland hat-trick came when Kevin Mahon fired three past Finn Harps at Finn Park on 15 December 1985. Jim Crossan did not remain in charge of the team for long, however, and his quick departure by the end of 1985 allowed new manager Noel King to bring worldly flair to the Brandywell in the form of the Brazilian, Nelson da Silva, and South African, Owen Da Gama. A throwback to Derry's Irish League days saw Declan McDowell solidify the defence while Kevin Mahon worked wonders on the wing. With another local favourite, Tony O'Doherty, in midfield, the club went on to clinch the League of Ireland First Division Shield in their first season of football in the Republic of Ireland with a 6\u20131 aggregate victory over Longford Town FC.\"Historic Shield Victory for City \", CityWeb, 2007. The following season, Derry left Shelbourne F.C. in their wake as they won the First Division and promotion to the Premier Division in 1987.\"First League Title in LOI \", CityWeb, 2007. Alex Krstic, with his 18 goals, ended the season as the First Division's top scorer.
