They competed in two Football League competitions spread over the full season \u2013 the Lancashire Section, Northern Group Principal Competition, for 26 games, and then in the Lancashire Section, Northern Group Subsidiary Competition, for a further ten games. The club finished third in the principal competition and second in the subsidiary competition.

The FA Cup was suspended for the duration of the war.", "Some Blackpool players had enlisted, but the nucleus of the team remained for the start of the season, including goalkeeper James Mitchell, who had played only five league games the previous season and who wore glasses in matches. Other players included Jimmy Jones, Joe Bainbridge, George Wilson, Bobby Booth, Jack Charles, Len Appleton and Ben Green. With Blackburn Rovers not having a team in the competition, some of their players joined Blackpool, including Bob Crompton, who was made captain, Eddie Latheron and George Chapman.", "Blackpool began the campaign on 4 September 1915, with an away match at Southport Central. The visitors lost 2\u20130 in front of a crowd of around 1,100 (attendances recorded during the war years were often estimated). In their next match, at home to Oldham Athletic, which they won 4\u20131, Blackpool played in an all-white kit, rather than the black, red and yellow hoops they had adopted the previous season. After fourteen games, Blackpool were in sixth place in the league, and with four games left were pushing for a top-two finish. On 5 February 1916, they lost 1\u20130 at Liverpool in front of a crowd given as 16,000, the second-highest recorded attendance to watch the club during the war years. It was their final defeat of the season, and they finished in third place with a 4\u20130 win over Rochdale at home in front of 4,000 on 26 February. The competition was won by Manchester City. Blackpool had used just nineteen players in the first part of the season, with Eddie Latheron finishing as top scorer with thirteen goals, and Jack Chapman second-top with nine goals.", "The season as a whole was considered a success by the club, both financially and on the pitch, with consistently decent attendances providing gate receipts that enabled the club's committee to reduce the club's debt. The star players were considered to be Bob Crompton, who regularly won the Man of the Match award, and Eddie Latheron for his sixteen goals."]}, {"page": "Edwin Latheron", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eddie Latheron"]}, {"page": "Danny Shea (footballer)", "response": ["His time at Blackburn was interrupted by World War I, but he scored regularly and his 27 goals (together with Eddie Latheron's 13) in 1913\u201314 helped the club win the Football League Division One championship that season.
