The film tells the story of an upright Christian police officer investigating the disappearance of a young girl, the search for whom leads him to a remote Scottish isle inhabited by pagans. While staying at the Green Man Pub, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is roused from prayer by the landlord's daughter Willow, played by Britt Ekland, who sings the erotic ballad through the adjoining wall of their separate bedrooms while completely naked. The song is an attempt to seduce Howie by accentuating Willow's sensuality. The music is played by the band Magnet. According to the film's associate musical director Gary Carpenter, the screen version was sung by Rachel VerneyGary Carpenter (2000), The Wicker Man: Settling the Score (although some have believed that it was sung by the Scottish jazz singer Annie Ross).
