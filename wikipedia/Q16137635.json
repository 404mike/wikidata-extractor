In January 1975 the Naughty Rhythms Tour included Dr. Feelgood, Kokomo and Chilli Willi who were three top-flight London pub rock bands wishing to play bigger venues.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s he played drums for Marianne Faithfull on her albums which included Broken English and Dangerous Acquaintances.

She was also unhappy with the way Mundy interacted with the performers: \"We went through some amazing scenes. He was treating the band like they couldn't play and didn't know what they were doing - and in a way, me too, but particularly the band. It was a divide and conquer trip.
