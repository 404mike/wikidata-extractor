In 1846, he was charged with training all of Broadwood's tuners in equal temperament, as many were still using the older meantone system. In 1849, he was named to the status of \"senior workman,\" and he remained an employee of this company for the rest of his life. Despite having very limited musical training on the pianoforte and the organ, he gained a reputation for his performances of Chopin's music. He wrote many reviews of books on musical ethnology or musical antiquity for The Athen\u00e6um and The Musical Times. In 1891 he gave the Cantor lectures on Musical instruments, their construction and capabilities to the Royal Society of Arts.\n\nHis chief energies were devoted to a study of the science of music and of the history and quality of keyboard instruments. On the latter subject he became an unrivalled authority. He wrote profusely on musical history, contributing 134 articles to 'Grove's Dictionary', and several to the ninth edition of the 'Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'. In 1881 he made a journey through Germany to examine historic pianofortes in the royal palaces, in particular the Gottfried Silbermann pianofortes that had belonged to Frederick the Great. He verified that they were made after the design of Bartolomeo Cristofori, rather than that of Christoph Schroeter, as had previously been believed.  \nHis major publications were 'Musical Instruments, Historic, Rare, and Unique' (1881), a standard work illustrated in colour by William Gibb; and 'Description and history of the pianoforte and of the older keyboard stringed instruments' (1896).\nHipkins married in October 1850 and the marriage produced a son John, who became a noted wood-engraver, and a daughter Edith, who became a highly successful portrait painter.\nHipkins, Carl Engel and Thomas Taphouse created three of the outstanding antiquarian collections of musical instruments in the U.K.\nAccording to his will, the Royal Institution received his collection of tuning forks and the Royal College of Music received his collection of musical instruments.\n\nHipkins's performances on harpsichord and clavichord, notably of Bach's \"Goldberg\" Variations and Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue, exerted a strong influence on Arnold Dolmetsch and other early musicians and were highly praised by George Bernard Shaw", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dives and Lazarus (ballad)", "response": ["Lucy Broadwood wrote that the musicologist Alfred James Hipkins had known the tune for years and called it \"Lazarus\", but did not know the lyrics. An elderly woman in Westminster, London, in 1892 reportedly recognised the tune Hipkins knew as belonging to a song about the Lazarus parable. Broadwood matched a typical version of the lyrics to \"Dives and Lazarus\" with this tune attested by Hipkins and the lady from Westminster, stating that \"they suit it so well that there is a great probability of their having at one time been associated together\". Broadwood then published the Hipkins tune with those lyrics in English Country Songs (1893) under the name \"Lazarus\". Her notes and transcription of the tune can be seen on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library. Peter Kennedy's 1952 recording of Emily Bishop of Bromsberrow Heath, Gloucestershire (available via the British Library Sound Archive) uses a similar text and tune, suggesting that Broadwood was correct in matching Afred Hipkins' tune with the old text."]}, {"page": "Constance Bache", "response": ["She lectured on \"Modern Russian composers\", and one of the last acts of her busy life was to write an \"appreciation\" of her old friend, Alfred James Hipkins, in the columns of the July issue of the Monthly Musical Record.
