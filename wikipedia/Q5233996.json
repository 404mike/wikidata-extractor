The season was a poor experience on and off the pitch, starting with a 10-22 loss to Hull Kingston Rovers, in which Alfred Francis scored one of Treherbert's two tries, which was followed by a further 11 straight losses. To complicate matters further, the attendance figures at home matches were poor, last minute team changes were frequent and their club secretary, H.R. Jones, resigned during the season. The only good news the club received was when one of their forwards, David Galloway was selected for the Wales national team, in a late 1909 away encounter with England.
