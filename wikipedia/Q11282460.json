The trade paper Harrison's Report said that \"[i]f a contest were to be held to determine which has been the filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture in the history of the motion picture business, I am sure that Greed would win.\" Variety Weekly called it \"an out-and-out box office flop\" only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that \"nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time\" and that despite its \"excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story\u00a0 ... it does not entertain.\" In its December 1924 \u2013 January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it \"one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture.\" In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that \"the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types\u2014they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism.\" Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM \"clipped this production as much as they dared\u00a0 ... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning.\" In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim \"a genius\u00a0 ... badly in need of a stopwatch.\" Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying \"a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in.\" A March 1925 review in Pictureplay magazine stated, \"perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice.\"", "There were also reports that MGM had retained a copy of the original version. Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art claimed that a copy was locked in the MGM vaults, although Thalberg denied it. It was also reported that John Houseman had a private screening at MGM and that MGM owned two copies stored in a vault in a Utah salt mine. Lotte Eisner once claimed that in the 1950s and 1960s, several cans of films labeled \"McTeague\" were found in MGM's vaults and destroyed by executives who did not know that it was footage from Greed. MGM executive Al Lewin said that several years after the film's release Stroheim asked him for the cut footage.

Barry talked Bu\u00f1uel into joining a committee formed to help educate those within the U.S. government who might not have appreciated fully the effectiveness of film as a medium of propaganda. Bu\u00f1uel was hired to produce a shortened version of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935) as a demonstration project. The finished product was a compilation of scenes from Riefenstahl's Nazi epic with Hans Bertram's Feuertaufe. Bu\u00f1uel stayed at MoMA to work for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) as part of a production team that would gather, review and edit films intended as anti-fascist propaganda to be distributed in Latin America by American embassies. While being vetted for the job at the OCIAA, upon being asked if he was a Communist, he replied: \"I am a Republican,\" and, apparently, the interviewer did not realize that Bu\u00f1uel was referring to the Spanish socialist coalition government, not the American political party.  Describing Bu\u00f1uel's work at MoMA, his friend, composer Gustavo Pittaluga, stated: \"Luis created maybe 2,000 remarkable works. We were sent anodyne documentaries, often extremely feeble primary materials, which the Museum team turned into marvellous films.
