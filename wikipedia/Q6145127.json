Unlike absolute idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or \"Absolute\". Leibniz' form of idealism, known as Panpsychism, views \"monads\" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are \"substantial forms of being, \"elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is substance while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a pre-established harmony by God, the central monad, between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian theism. The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism.The New Cambridge Modern History: The era of violence, 1898-1945, edited by David Thomson University Press, 1960, p. 135 According to Ward the universe is composed of \"psychic monads\" of different levels, interacting for mutual self-betterment.Hugh Joseph Tallon The concept of self in British and American idealism 1939, p. 118"]}, {"page": "March 4", "response": ["*  1925   \u2013 James Ward, English psychologist and philosopher (b. 1843)"]}, {"page": "Panentheism", "response": ["Philosophers who embraced panentheism have included Thomas Hill Green (1839\u20131882), James Ward (1843\u20131925), Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison (1856\u20131931) and Samuel Alexander (1859\u20131938).John W.
