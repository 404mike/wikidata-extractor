Brooke then offered Browning for the post, and Mountbatten accepted. Pownall considered that Browning was \"excellently qualified\" for the post, although the latter had no staff college training and had never held a staff job before. Pownall noted that his \"only reservation is that I believe [Browning] is rather nervy and highly strung\".

The letter covered several purportedly sensitive subjects, such as the (unwanted) award of Purple Heart medals by US forces to British servicemen serving with them and the appointment of a new commander of the Brigade of Guards.
