He worked with Core Design between 1996 and 1998, for the first three Tomb Raider games, among others. He worked also with high-profile names such as the Spice Girls and Orange. In 2008 he became full-time Audio Director for Vatra Games where he worked until 2010. After this he became Audio Director at City Interactive in Warsaw where he worked on Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 and Alien Rage. McCree then went freelance and set up his own studio in Brno, Czech Republic.He has been praised among critics and has received several informal awards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tomb Raider", "response": ["The original Tomb Raider theme was composed by Nathan McCree. He created the original theme music after having discussions with Gard about the character of Lara Croft. Having decided to use Classical English music as an inspiration, he decided to create something simple for the theme song. Its simplicity made rearrangements and orchestrations easy. For his work on the first three Tomb Raider games, he was given fairly minimal briefs, and for Tomb Raider III he was working on the game as a freelancer as he had left the company. For The Last Revelation, Peter Connelly replaced Nathan McCree as the main composer, using McCree's music as a basis for his work. He composed the opening theme for The Last Revelation, saying that the opening melody came to him out of the blue, and added Egyptian motifs to fit in with the game's setting. Chronicles was originally going to have a sizeable original opening theme, but due to time constraints the majority of it ended up being discarded, much to Connelly's later regret. Only the opening segment survived. The music for The Angel of Darkness, composed by Connelly and Martin Iveson, was the one element of production that did not encounter problems, as recording was finished before the major content cuts happened. Scored using a full orchestra as opposed to the synthesised instruments of previous titles, it was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra."]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Nathan McCree"]}, {"page": "List of video game musicians", "response": ["*Nathan McCree \u2013 Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2 and Tomb Raider 3"]}, {"page": "BC Racers", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by Nathan McCree"]}, {"page": "King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth", "response": ["* Nathan McCree, music producer and composer of the original Tomb Raider game music"]}, {"page": "Asterix and the Great Rescue", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by Nathan McCree"]}, {"page": "Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation", "response": ["The game's music was composed by Peter Connelly, who had previously worked on Tomb Raider III and been credited as \"Additional Sound Effects\".

This allowed him to create a large-scape symphonic score within hardware limitations. He tried to imagine how players would feel in each environment while he created the score. For example, he used calming music for the Croft Manor level, and the epic orchestra sound for Lara's escape from the Sea Serpent guarding King Arthur's tomb. Each level had its own lead instrument, taken from the region where the level was set, forming a part of its overall score. Folmann extensively researched characteristic musical styles from each region. He also gave individual characters their own musical motifs. Ethnic instruments played a major role in the overall score. Folmann bought a variety of instruments including duduk, shakuhachi, African drums and Bolivian pan flutes. The series' main theme, a four-note motif composed for the original game by Nathan McCree, was incorporated into the main theme of Legend using a duduk.

Production began in 1994 and took 18 months, with a budget of \u00a3440,000. The character of Lara was based on several influences, including Tank Girl and Indiana Jones. The 3D grid-based level design, innovative for its time, was inspired by the structure of Egyptian tombs. The music was composed by Nathan McCree, who took inspiration from English classical music. Originally announced in 1995, the title went on to receive extensive press attention and heavy promotion from Eidos Interactive.", "The music for Tomb Raider was composed by Nathan McCree, who at the time was an in-house composer for Core Design. The main inspiration behind the score for McCree was English Classical music. This approach was directly influenced by his conversations with Gard about Lara's character. Based on this, he kept the main theme simple and melodic. The main theme used a four-note motif, which continues to appear through the series. The piece \"Where The Depths Unfold\", used when Lara is swimming underwater, was a choral work. They did not have the space or budget for live music recording, which was challenging for McCree as he needed to create the whole thing using synthesisers. To make the choir sound realistic, he inserted recordings of himself breathing at the right points so it sounded like an actual choir. For each track, McCree got a basic description of where the music would be used, then was left to create it. There was no time for rewrites, so each track was included in the game as first composed.", "Category:Video games scored by Nathan McCree"]}, {"page": "Barnard Castle School", "response": ["* Nathan McCree, composer."]}, {"page": "Bubba 'n' Stix", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by Nathan McCree"]}, {"page": "Soulstar", "response": ["Soulstar makes intensive use of the features available on the Sega CD hardware for its visuals, in addition to being the first title on the add-on that displayed sprites at 64 colors.
