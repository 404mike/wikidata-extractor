He then achieved his ambition to teach art by accepting a position at Highgate School, London, where he was senior art master from 1944 until 1973. His pupils included the historian Sir Martin Gilbert, Royal Academicians Anthony Green and Patrick Procktor and composers John Tavener and John Rutter. He painted a portrait of the school's cricket coach, former test player Albert Knight. Wales never left his consciousness or imagination, as he would return home in holidays, take his study sketches back to London and complete his canvasses. Williams' particular technique was applying thick oil paint with a palette knife. Williams was predominately a landscape painter but he also was an accomplished portraitist and something of a cartoonist."]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Anthony Green (born 1939)"]}, {"page": "New English Art Club", "response": ["Current NEAC members include Peter Brown, Frederick Cuming, Anthony Green, Ken Howard, Charles Williams, Richard Bawden and Martin Yeoman."]}, {"page": "Anthony Green", "response": ["Anthony Green may refer to:", "*Anthony Green (musician) (born 1982), lead vocalist of Circa Survive and Saosin", "*Anthony Green (actor) (born 1970), British actor", "*Anthony Green (painter) (born 1939), English realist painter and printmaker"]}, {"page": "Ben Levene", "response": ["Ben Levene  (born Gerald Philip Levene, 23 December 1938 \u2013 15 September 2010) was a British painter.
