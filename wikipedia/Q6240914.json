Isted's batting and bowling style is unknown.  It's not known where or when he was born, but it is known he was christened at Lindfield, Sussex on 9 December 1810.Isted made two first-class appearances for Sussex, both against Nottinghamshire in 1853 at the Royal Brunswick Ground, Hove and Trent Bridge.  He also made a single first-class appearance for the Gentlemen of England in that season against the United All-England Eleven at the Royal Brunswick Ground.  He took a total of 5 wickets in his three first-class matches, which came at an approximate average of 16.25.  The average is approximate because of incomplete statistics on how many runs he conceded as a bowler, with him having conceded at least 65 runs.  His best bowling figures were 3/50.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isted (disambiguation)", "response": ["*John Isted, 19th century English cricketer", "*John Isted (MP) (fl. 1523\u20131557), English politician and MP for Hastings"]}, {"page": "List of Sussex County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Isted (1853) : J.
