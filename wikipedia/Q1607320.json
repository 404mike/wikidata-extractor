His achievements included having established and led two military balloon companies in Cologne, Germany at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, leading the first aerial trip in England for purposes of photography (with Henry Negretti in 1863), piloting a British Association flight from Wolverhampton, England that achieved a record altitude with James Glaisher in 1862, reaching at least 29,000 ft (8,800 m), and perhaps as high as 35,000 to 37,000 ft (10,700 to 11,300 m)], as well as founding The Balloon, or Aerostatic Magazine (in 1845) and collecting his experiences in an autobiography, My Life and Balloon Experiences (from 1887 to 1890).
