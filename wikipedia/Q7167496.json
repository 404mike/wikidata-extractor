The film itself draws from the St. Pancras Poor Law Guardians program in which it shows a newly married Mary (Lettie Paxton), cleaning her house and breathing in laundry fumes. Mary is then violently confronted by her husband Jack (Jack Denton) which causes her health visitor, played by Baird, to intervene. Bairds character introduces Mary to a School for Mothers, where once pregnant, Mary chooses the advice of a certified nurse rather than her grandmother. This reflects the 1917 health goal of teaching women to choose good advice rather than advice passed down by an older generation. Baird used the film Motherhood to create political demands for social improvement. She used her fame and on-screen promotions to \"better the women of Britain.\""]}, {"page": "List of British films before 1920", "response": ["| Enoch Arden || Percy Nash || Gerald Lawrence, Fay Davis, Ben Webster || Drama || ", "| The Harbour Lights || Percy Nash || Gerald Lawrence, Mercy Hatton, Daisy Cordell || Drama || ", "| In the Ranks || Percy Nash || Gregory Scott, Daisy Cordell, James Lindsay || Crime || ", "| The Coal King || Percy Nash || Daisy Cordell, Gregory Scott || Drama ||", "| Flying from Justice || Percy Nash || Gregory Scott, Douglas Payne, Joan Ritz || Crime ||", "| The Little Minister || Percy Nash || Joan Ritz, Gregory Scott, Henry Vibart || Romance ||", "| Master and Man || Percy Nash || Gregory Scott, Joan Ritz, Daisy Cordell || Drama ||", "| A Rogue's Wife || Percy Nash || Gregory Scott, Daisy Cordell, Joan Ritz || Crime ||", "| Royal Love || Percy Nash || Joan Ritz, Eve Balfour, Gregory Scott || Adventure ||", "|Disraeli||Charles Calvert  Percy Nash||Dennis Eadie, Mary Jerrold||Biopic|| Based on a play by Louis N.
