After winning the toss and choosing to bat, Namibia lost both openers to opposing captain Craig Wright, and after captain Deon Kotze went for a half-hour three, they were 73 for four. Sarel Burger (69) and Gerrie Snyman (41) put on 70 for the fifth wicket, but spinner Ross Lyons got both of them out to end with figures of four for 10 in the first innings, and Paul Hoffmann also got two wickets as Namibia were bowled out for 168. Scotland ended the first day on 95 for three, with Ryan Watson 62 not out. On a rain-shortened second day, with only 48.5 of the stipulated 104 overs bowled, Watson completed his maiden first-class century, with wicket-keeper Colin Smith contributing 70 in a stand of 177. Smith was out shortly before the close of play, and when Neil McCallum and Watson fell early on the third day, Scotland had slipped to 279 for six. However, a partnership of 68 for the seventh wicket between Wright (40) and Dewald Nel (25) helped take Scotland to 360, giving them a first-innings lead of 192. Hoffmann then single-handedly reduced Namibia to 35 for five, finishing the match with figures of seven wickets for 32 runs, and though the lower order briefly resisted, Scotland still completed an innings victory inside three days."]}, {"page": "Lyons (surname)", "response": ["* Ross Lyons (born 1984), Scottish cricketer"]}, {"page": "2007 Cricket World Cup squads", "response": ["| 8 || Ross Lyons || 8 December 1984 || 13 || Left || Slow left arm orthodox ||  Clydesdale"]}, {"page": "Scottish cricket team in Bangladesh in 2006\u201307", "response": ["* Ross Lyons"]}, {"page": "2007 ICC World Twenty20 squads", "response": ["|| 8 || Ross Lyons || 8 December 1984 || 0 || Left || Slow left arm orthodox ||  Clydesdale"]}, {"page": "2010 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier", "response": ["*Ross Lyons"]}, {"page": "2010 Associates Twenty20 Series in Kenya", "response": ["*Ross Lyons"]}, {"page": "2010 ICC World Cricket League Division One", "response": ["Ross Lyons"]}, {"page": "2004 Under-19 Cricket World Cup squads", "response": ["* Ross Lyons"]}, {"page": "Regional Pro Series", "response": ["* Ross Lyons"]}]}}
