Cofnas' article prompted a response defending MacDonald from Edward Dutton, a theologian and YouTuber affiliated with the Ulster Institute for Social Research. Dutton's response was rejected by Human Nature, and was instead published by Evolutionary Psychological Science. The attention prompted by Cofnas's paper was itself commented on. Anthropologist Robert Boyd of the Arizona State described the topic itself as \"totally toxic,\" Steven Pinker described MacDonald's and Dutton's arguments as \"extraordinarily weak,\" while Aryeh Tuchman of the Anti-Defamation League said that the renewed attention falsely implied that MacDonald's antisemitic tropes have academic legitimacy."]}, {"page": "Mark Collett", "response": ["*Edward Dutton"]}, {"page": "Mankind Quarterly", "response": ["The editor-in-chief is Richard Lynn..

These authors argue that in multiple historical societies, such as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient China, and the Islamic Civilization, the more intelligent individuals not only had access to contraception but were also more likely to use it effectively. While measuring the level of general intelligence (the g-factor) in periods for which there is no psychometric data is problematic, the authors suggest that one could estimate it via proxies, such as the number of innovations per century per billion people."]}, {"page": "Bruce Charlton", "response": ["* with Edward Dutton, The Genius Famine: why we need geniuses, why they're dying out, and why we must rescue them  (2016; online copy)"]}, {"page": "Gerhard Meisenberg", "response": ["Gerhard Meisenberg (January 22, 1953) is a German biochemist.
