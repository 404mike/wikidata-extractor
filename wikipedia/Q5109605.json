He has toured extensively with smaller ensembles including the Michael Nyman Band, the ensembles Endymion, Icebreaker and the Composers Ensemble.  Since 2002 Forshaw has been Professor of Saxophone at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama.Forshaw is a member of Notes In\u00e9gales, directed by Peter Wiegold, and was featured as soloist with the group in 2005 playing Donatoni\u2019s Hot.

Sanctuary reached No.1 in both the Amazon.co.uk Classical Chart and New Zealand\u2019s Concert FM charts, and made the Classic FM \"Hall of Fame\" in 2005.\nIn 2006 Forshaw turned down a four album deal with SonyBMG in favour of setting up his own label, IntegraRecordsUK. This was to avoid having to consider market forces when creating further albums; something he felt would kill the creative process.  His second album, Renouncement, was released on Integra in April 2007.  He was subsequently commissioned to write a piece in memory of victims of the London bombings of 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005 in music", "response": ["*Christian Forshaw \u2013 Mortal Flesh"]}, {"page": "2005 in British music", "response": [", as a CD, with Bryn Terfel among the performers.
