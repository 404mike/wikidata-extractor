He initially prepared for a career in the Church of England at Oxford and Lichfield and was ordained as an Anglican deacon in 1908.  He then converted to Roman Catholicism and began styling himself as a Catholic priest.  He worked as a teacher of English and Latin while pursuing scholarly work on the English drama of the 17th century, which earned him election to the Royal Society of Literature in 1916.\nSummers became a well known figure in London society as a result of the publication of his History of Witchcraft and Demonology in 1926.  That work was followed by other studies on witchcraft, vampires, and werewolves, in all of which he professed to believe.  Summers was also responsible for the first English translation, published in 1928, of the 15th-century witch hunter's manual, the Malleus Maleficarum.  Noted for his eccentric personality and interests, he has been described as \"arguably the most seminal twentieth century purveyor of pop culture occultism.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 10", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 Montague Summers, English clergyman and author (b. 1880)"]}, {"page": "April 10", "response": ["*  1880   \u2013 Montague Summers, English clergyman and author (d. 1948)"]}, {"page": "Gothic fiction", "response": ["The excesses, stereotypes, and frequent absurdities of traditional Gothic made it rich territory for satire.Skarda 1986.

Jane Austen's novel is valuable for including a list of early Gothic works since known as the Northanger Horrid Novels. These books with their lurid titles were once thought to be the creations of Jane Austen's imagination, though later research by Michael Sadleir and Montague Summers confirmed that they actually existed and stimulated renewed interest in the Gothic.

A secret British society called the \"Order of Chaeronea\" campaigned for the legalization of homosexuality, and counted playwright Oscar Wilde among its members in the last decades of the 19th century.McKenna, Neil (2003), \"The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography\". (London: Century)  The society was founded by George Cecil Ives, one of the earliest gay rights campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the \"Cause\". Ives met Wilde at the Authors' Club in London in 1892. Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his moustache, and once kissed him passionately in the Travellers' Club. In 1893, Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit. In 1897, Ives created and founded the first homosexual rights group, the Order of Chaeronea. Members included Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson."]}, {"page": "Margaret Murray", "response": ["Rose suggested that the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her \"imposing credentials\" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed \"the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [Robert] Graves would be familiar with\". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it \"appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age\", including \"the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets\", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, the folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a \"sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument\" between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. \"How refreshing\", noted the historian Hilda Ellis Davidson, \"and exciting her first book was at that period.

This book, published in 1688, is regarded as one of the first abolitionist and humanitarian novels published in the English language. It is credited as precursor to Jean-Jaques Rousseau's Discourses on Inequality. Since the 1970s Behn's literary works have been re-evaluated by feminist critics and writers. Behn was rediscovered as a significant female writer by Maureen Duffy, Angeline Goreau, Ruth Perry, Hilda Lee Smith, Moira Ferguson, Jane Spencer, Dale Spender, Elaine Hobby and Janet Todd.

Montague Summers, an author of scholarly works on the English drama of the 17th century, published a six-volume collection of her work, in hopes of rehabilitating her reputation. Summers was fiercely passionate about the work of Behn and found himself incredibly devoted to the appreciation of 17th century literature. Felix Schelling wrote in The Cambridge History of English Literature, that she was \"a very gifted woman, compelled to write for bread in an age in which literature... catered habitually to the lowest and most depraved of human inclinations,\" and that, \"Her success depended upon her ability to write like a man.\" Edmund Gosse remarked that she was, \"...the George Sand of the Restoration\"."]}, {"page": "Restoration comedy", "response": ["Distaste for sexual impropriety long kept Restoration comedy off the stage, locked in a critical poison cupboard.

According to this testimony, they repeatedly carried out rituals that would create a special potion for the King.
