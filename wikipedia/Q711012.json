She also sang in 1816 in Mart\u00edn y Soler's Una cosa rara and performed the roles of Dorabella and Susanna in Mozart's operas Cos\u00ec fan tutte, and The Marriage of Figaro.Raoul Meloncelli,  Bartolozzi, Lucia Elisabeth, in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, volume 6, 1964 (accessible for free online in Treccani.it) She had immediate success in both London and Paris. In the French capital city she occasionally appeared at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien and various other theatres. A legend that she performed as a tragic actress at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais playing Camille opposite Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Talma in Corneille's Horace has however turned out to be untrue. The mistake was the result of a misreading of Talma's M\u00e9moires wherein the actor narrates an episode in 1790 in which a 'Madame Vestris', not Eliza Lucia Vestris who was born several years later, but Fran\u00e7oise-Marie-Rosette Gourgaud, the wife of Angiolo Vestris, and thus a great-aunt-in-law of Eliza Lucia's husband, was once scandalized by Talma's showing up bare-legged on stage in an unusually realistic ancient-Roman costume. It was, in fact, the rehearsal of Voltaire's Brutus, and not of Corneille's Horace. The legend was first stated in 1847, when Madame Vestris was still alive, by Thomas Marshall in his book on British actors and actresses,Marshall, p. 41. and, after being almost held up to ridicule by John Westland Marston in 1888,Marston, II,  pp. 148\u2013149. it was on the contrary taken as true by Joseph Knight in his article on Madame Vestris in the Dictionary of National Biography,New York, Macmillan, 1894, Volume 32, article Mathews, Lucia Elizabeth or Elizabetta (accessible for free on line at Wikisource). and has since been regularly revived by the main following encyclopaedical sources.Such as, for instance, the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, starting from its 1911 eleventh edition (accessible for free online at Internet Archive), the authoritative Enciclopedia dello spettacolo, The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, and the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani. Finally, the legend has been refuted by modern biographers of Madame Vestris.Appleton, pp. 11\u201312; Williams, p. 34.", "*John Westland Marston, Our recent actors: being recollections critical, and, in many cases, personal, of late distinguished performers of both sexes.

His performances were known for their polish and subtlety; in more sentimental roles, such as Old Parr, he was able to mix sentiment with cool irony. He was at home in Augustan and other eighteenth century roles, but he is not remembered as a Shakespearian actor. Macready remembered him as justly famous for \"studious correctness\", but described him as second to William Dowton and Joseph Munden in \"the rich quality of humor.\"Macready 130. William Hazlitt praised the conservatism of his style in the older plays. Leigh Hunt disagreed, disparaging Farren in favor of Dowton as Anthony Absolute (Sheridan's The Rivals). Even Hunt, though, acknowledged Farren's exceptional self-possession.Hunt 203. Writing in The Times in 1855, Henry Morley called Farren \"one of the most finished actors by whom the stage has been adorned in the present century.\" Writing after the actor's death, John Westland Marston recalls that the actor excelled in portraying \"the vanity, the self-love, the inconsistency, and now and then the redeeming good-feeling of worldly, well-bred people, and occasionally the credulous faith of simple, guileless people.\"Marston 160."]}, {"page": "Arthur O'Shaughnessy", "response": ["The artists Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown were among O'Shaughnessy's circle of friends, and in 1873, he married Eleanor Marston, the daughter of author John Westland Marston and the sister of the poet Philip Bourke Marston.

Her achievement was not considered extraordinary, but it attracted some favourable attention, and she was able to continue with acting.

In November 1866 she received favourable reviews for her portrayal of Victorine, another character in The Hugenot Captain. This time the play was performed at the Adelphi Theatre.
