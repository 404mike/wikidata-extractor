He was a right-handed batsman whose first-class career with Sussex lasted from 1926 to 1948. In 483 matches he scored 21,725 runs at an average of 33.57, with 42 centuries and a highest score of 200* . He scored 1000 runs in a season 14 times, with a best of 2,122 in 1947. Before World War Two he was a middle-order batsman, but after it he became John Langridge's opening partner.\nHe was a member of a notable cricketing family, being the brother of Jim Parks senior and the uncle of Jim Parks junior. He stood as a first-class umpire in 1949 and 1950, and played one match for the Commonwealth XI in India in 1949-50, his last first-class match.  Afterwards he was a coach at Taunton School.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sussex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* 5th \u2013 297 Jim Parks and Harry Parks v.

After winning the toss, the Sussex batsmen struggled with his length and variation of pace, and he hit the off-stump five times in the first innings alone to end with 6/34. Loxton also bowled well in the first innings, taking 3/13. Australia replied to Sussex's 86 strongly, and were already 254/1 by the end of the first day. Powered by Morris's 184 and with centuries too for Bradman (109) and Harvey (100*), Australia added a further 295 runs on the second day to declare at 549/5. They then still had time to send down 63.3 overs, enough to finish the match within two days. In Sussex's second innings Lindwall took two wickets in the first over. Harry Parks made 61, but Sussex were all out for 138, losing their last seven wickets for 59.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (1949), p. 228. In all, eight of Lindwall's wickets were bowled, five these by swinging yorkers, the batsmen unable to counter the swerving deliveries. Fingleton said that \"Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions\" as Sussex \"crumpled completely\u00a0... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew\".Fingleton, p. 79. At the other end, Toshack helped to pin down the batsmen for Lindwall. He delivered 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs."]}, {"page": "Hugh Bartlett", "response": ["Bartlett's finest year was 1938. While travelling by train to Leeds to play Yorkshire in May, his captain Jack Holmes told him : \"If you score 50 I will give you your cap ... a 50 against Yorkshire is worth 150 against any other county.\" Sussex lost their first five wickets for 106 when Bartlett joined Harry Parks. They added 126 in 75 minutes of which Bartlett scored 94. The bowlers were Bill Bowes, Hedley Verity, Frank Smailes, Emmott Robinson and Cyril Turner. He hit seven sixes (all off Verity) and nine fours. In two overs by Verity, Bartlett scored 062660 and 006606. The last six was his final scoring shot as he tried to hit Smailes over long off and was caught by Maurice Leyland \"with his heels on the boundary and left hand outstretched\". Bartlett was duly awarded his county cap.Gerald Brodribb, Some Great Six-hitting Feats, The Cricketer, 20 July 1957, p.\u00a0346"]}, {"page": "Alan Melville", "response": ["The reason Melville was captaining Sussex at the end of the 1933 season was that the regular captain Robert Scott, himself a stand-in for the permanently unwell K. S. Duleepsinhji, had stood down because of the death of his father; Scott was unable to resume in 1934, and Melville took over the Sussex captaincy for the next two seasons. Sussex had finished second in the County Championship for each of the preceding two seasons and under Melville in 1934 they again finished second, but there was veiled criticism of changes to the county's style of play in the 1935 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. \"Sussex, renowned for their attractive and enterprising hitting, developed a somewhat stodgy game in their efforts to finish at the top and they thus defeated their own ends,\" it said. \"At times they would not risk anything.\" Wisden compared Melville's \"strange disinclination to experiment\" with the adventurous approach taken by Maurice Tate, the senior professional at the club, who captained the side when Melville missed a few games. As a batsman, Melville was highly successful, scoring 1504 runs at an average of 42.97 with three centuries, though in the heady world of Sussex batting at the time that still left him only fifth in the county's batting averages, behind Tommy Cook, John Langridge, Jim Parks, Sr. and Harry Parks."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Playfair emphasised the contrast between strong batting and weak bowling at Sussex who recovered from bottom place in 1946 to finish a creditable equal ninth. Only Jim Cornford performed consistently well among the bowlers while six batsmen scored over 1,000 runs. Three of these exceeded 2,000 in all matches: John Langridge, George Cox and Harry Parks. James Langridge reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to appendicitis. Charles Oakes and new captain Hugh Bartlett were the other two. His predecessor turned club secretary Billy Griffith had a poor season with the bat but kept wicket well enough to be selected for England's winter tour. Other players who appeared were Paul Carey, Donald Smith, Jim Wood, Jack Oakes, John Nye and two future Test players Alan Oakman and David Sheppard.Playfair, pp. 99\u2013100."]}, {"page": "Harry Parks", "response": ["*Harry Parks (cricketer) (1906\u20131984), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Parks (surname)", "response": ["* Harry Parks (cricketer) (1906\u20131984), English cricketer"]}]}}
