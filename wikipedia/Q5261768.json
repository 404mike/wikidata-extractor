He began his career with Philips Industrial in 1957, and became managing director of Expandite in 1966. He moved to Burmah Oil in 1971, and became a director of Burmah Oil Trading before moving to Ferranti in 1975.\nAlun-Jones was appointed chairman of Ferranti in 1982 and oversaw the \u00a3420 million merger with the Pennsylvania based company International Signal & Control in 1987.  However, it soon became apparent that a subsidiary of ISC had been involved in a huge fraud which had inflated the value of ISC at the time of the merger.  Ferranti went into receivership in 1993.\nHe remained a director of several companies after leaving Ferranti and was chairman of the governors of Lancing College from 1986 to 1999. He was knighted in 1987.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancing College", "response": ["* Sir Derek Alun-Jones (1933\u20132004), Chairman of Ferranti (1982\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2008", "response": ["*Sir Derek Alun-Jones, 74, British businessman."]}, {"page": "1987 New Year Honours", "response": ["*John Derek Alun-Jones, Managing Director, Ferranti plc.
