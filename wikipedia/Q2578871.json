He added, \"It was short and only required a vote, I was a minority of one and lost. Roma and I were out. This left the question of what happened with Enya. I decided to stand back and say nothing\". Enya chose to leave with the Ryans and pursue a solo career as she felt confined in the group, and disliked being \"somebody in the background\". This caused some friction between the two parties at first, but they settled their differences. Nicky suggested to Enya that either she return to Gweedore \"with no particular definite future\", or live with him and Roma in Artane, Dublin \"and see what happens, musically\", which she accepted. After their bank denied them a loan, Enya sold her saxophone and gave piano lessons for income and the Ryans used what they could afford from their savings to build a recording facility in a shed in their garden. They named it Aigle Studio, after the French word for \"eagle\", and rented it out to musicians to help recoup the costs. The trio formed a musical partnership, with Nicky as Enya's producer and arranger and Roma her lyricist, and established their music company, Aigle Music. In the following two years, Enya developed her technique and composition by listening to recordings of her reciting pieces of classical music, and repeated the process until she started to improvise sections and develop her own arrangements. Her first composition was \"An Taibhse Uaighneach\", Irish for \"The Lonely Ghost\". During this time Enya played the synthesiser on Ceol Aduaidh (1983) by Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh and Frankie Kennedy, and performed with the duo and Mhaonaigh's brother Gear\u00f3id in their short lived group, Ragairne."]}, {"page": "September 30", "response": ["*  1955   \u2013 Frankie Kennedy, Northern Irish flute player  (d. 1994)"]}, {"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*Frankie Kennedy"]}, {"page": "Frankie", "response": ["*Frankie Kennedy (1955\u20131994), Irish musician"]}, {"page": "Altan (band)", "response": ["Altan are an Irish folk music band formed in County Donegal in 1987 by lead vocalist Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh and her husband Frankie Kennedy.
