However, when World War II broke in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell. They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 1947\u201348 season. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup trophy on three occasions within a five-year period, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952, and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960\u201361 season under the management of Charlie Mitten. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964\u201365 season after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967\u201368 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6\u20132 over two legs against Hungary's \u00dajpest in the final."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Tommy Walker||||RW||1946\u20131954||184||35||"]}, {"page": "Tommy Walker", "response": ["Tommy Walker may refer to:", "*Tommy Walker (winger) (fl. 1891\u20131893), English footballer (Port Vale)", "*Tommy Walker (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u2013?), Bradford City and Sheffield Wednesday footballer", "*Tommy Walker (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20131993), Scottish international football player and manager (Hearts, Chelsea)", "*Tommy Walker (footballer, born 1923) (1923\u20132005), Newcastle United and Oldham Athletic footballer", "*Tommy Walker (footballer, born 1964), Scottish footballer for Ayr United, Dumbarton, Stranraer and Albion Rovers", "*Tommy Walker (footballer, born February 1952) (born 1952), Stoke City and Burnley midfielder", "*Tommy Walker (footballer, born March 1952) (born 1952), Scottish footballer (Airdrieonians)", "*Tommy Walker (events director) (1922\u20131986), American producer of live events", "*Tommy Walker (worship leader), American composer and author", "*Tommy Walker (Brothers & Sisters), played by Balthazar Getty", "*Poltpalingada Booboorowie (died 1901), known as Tommy Walker, Aboriginal personality in Adelaide", "* Tommy Walker (The Who), a fictional character from the album Tommy and also its related musical media and film"]}, {"page": "1952 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|OR ||7|| Tommy Walker"]}, {"page": "1951 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|OR ||7|| Tommy Walker"]}, {"page": "Tommy Walker (footballer born 1923)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Walker (footballer, born 1923)"]}]}}
