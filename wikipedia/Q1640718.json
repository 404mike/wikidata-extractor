They decided to end the film with an embassy siege, but to make the film more relevant to US audiences they changed it to the US embassy. They also changed Iranian extremists to anti-nuclear protesters. Markstein wrote a treatment in a week, then Lloyd gave the job of writing a script to Reginald Rose. According to director Ian Sharp he was \"handed a script that needed a lot work\". Sharp flew to the United States to work on the script with Rose, but they \"never got to a really strong plot.\" The action scenes were rewritten by Sharp. The budget was raised by pre-selling the film to multiple territories.", "According to the DVD commentary, the film was made with the help of the 22 SAS Regiment at Hereford, although their commanding officer Peter de la Billi\u00e8re had initially refused to help in a pre-production meeting with Euan Lloyd. Director Ian Sharp, who was hired due to Lloyd's liking of his direction in the TV series The Professionals, was invited to SAS headquarters at Stirling Lines where he met some of the troops who assaulted the Iranian embassy. With the co-operation of the SAS achieved, production moved ahead swiftly.", "\"The film isn't a serious psychological study of a terrorist's mind, but it has been a good meaty part\", said Judy Davis. According to an interview with director Ian Sharp, Judy Davis wanted the dialogue scene between her terrorist character and Richard Widmark's Secretary of State rewritten.\"She wanted her character to counter some of the things Widmark says to her. I wasn\u2019t about to rewrite a scene of that magnitude that was already that well-written. I didn\u2019t think her suggestions made any sense anyhow. Behind her objections lurked an actor\u2019s ego.\"", "At the premiere people protested the film because it allegedly painted the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as terrorists. In a 2021 interview, director Ian Sharp said: \"This is one of the confusing things (...) In the film the point is that the CND is infiltrated by the terrorists. They are using a legitimate cause for their terrorism. When they are doing their machine gunning practice, they\u2019re using CND symbols to shoot at, to show their contempt. I don\u2019t know how they missed all the signs.\" In the same interview he conceded: \"It\u2019s probably my own fault.

The ending was also changed several times; Thompson re-writing it during filming. Hauer told him to re-write the script to make it more physical and with more focus on the psychic link that his character has with the creature. Due to all the stress during production, Maylam stepped back from finishing the film, so Ian Sharp and others involved in the film joined up to finish it. Sharp directed the finale which takes place in a flooded subway along with some other additional scenes and is credited as co-director in ending credits. The movie was filmed in eight weeks, between June 17 and August 9 of 1991 and was widely released in April 1992. Although it was re-titled again sometime during production from Black Tide to Split Second, the movie had different titles in other countries, like Killer Instinct (in France) and Detective Stone (in Italy).
