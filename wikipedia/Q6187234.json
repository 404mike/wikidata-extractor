Written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith and directed by Guillem Morales, the episode is set in a sleeper carriage on a French train. English doctor Maxwell, who is traveling to an important job interview, climbs into bed. He is disturbed first by drunk, flatulent German Jorg, and then by English couple Kath and Les. Later, while the others sleep, Australian backpacker Shona brings posh English backpacker Hugo back to the cabin, but the pair make a surprising discovery.

As each episode features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. Jack Whitehall, who was a fan of the show, says that he \"may or may not have nagged Reece and Steve to find a Jack Whitehall-shaped hole in the second series\", and was \"very thankful\" when they did. In addition to Pemberton, Shearsmith and Whitehall, \"La Couchette\" stars Julie Hesmondhalgh, Mark Benton, Jessica Gunning and George Glaves. Hesmondhalgh commended the cast, saying that, for her, it was a \"no brainer\" to appear in the episode. For Whitehall, working with Hesmondhalgh was \"very exciting, but also quite weird\", given the then-recent suicide of Hesmondhalgh's Coronation Street character, Hayley Cropper. Whitehall called Benton and Hesmondhalgh \"an amazing little double act\". The pair had previously played a husband and wife on the radio."]}, {"page": "Top Coppers", "response": ["*Jessica Gunning - Agent Romero"]}, {"page": "Back (TV series)", "response": ["*Jessica Gunning as Jan, barmaid"]}, {"page": "Strike (TV series)", "response": ["* Jessica Gunning as Holly Brockbank"]}, {"page": "Prime Suspect 1973", "response": ["* Jessica Gunning as WPC Kath Morgan"]}, {"page": "In the Dark (British TV series)", "response": ["*Jessica Gunning as DC Sophie Carson, the North Derbyshire Police officer on the field in the abduction case."]}, {"page": "The State (2017 TV series)", "response": ["* Jessica Gunning as Umm Walid; leader of the new arrivals house"]}, {"page": "The Outlaws (2021 TV series)", "response": ["* Jessica Gunning as Diane, the supervisor for community service"]}, {"page": "Apolo Awards", "response": ["* Pride \u2013 Ben Schnetzer, Monica Dolan, George MacKay, Bill Nighy, Andrew Scott, Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, Paddy Considine, Joseph Gilgun, Sophie Evans, Lisa Palfrey, Menna Trussler, Karina Fernandez, Liz White, Chris Overton, Jessica Gunning, Matthew Flynn, Jessie Cave and Freddie Fox (Golem)"]}]}}
