He received his B.A. (1956), M.F.A. (1958), and Ph.D. (1965) all at Princeton University and remained there after his graduation as a lecturer and research associate in the field of computer-generated electronic sound. During the 1960s he was an influential figure in American music theory circles, even though his list of publications was not extensive. His large collection of mostly unpublished documents and papers is held at Princeton University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tetrachord", "response": ["Theorists of the later 20th century often use the term \"tetrachord\" to describe any four-note set when analysing music of a variety of styles and historical periods.Benedict Taylor, \"Modal Four-Note Pitch Collections in the Music of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's American Period\", Music Theory Spectrum 32, no. 1 (Spring 2010): 44\u201359; Steven Block and Jack Douthett, \"Vector Products and Intervallic Weighting\", Journal of Music Theory 38, no. 1 (Spring 1994): 21\u201341; Ian Quinn, \"Listening to Similarity Relations\", Perspectives of New Music 39, no. 2 (Summer 2001): 108\u2013158; Joseph N.

The program was an expansion of earlier packages written by Mathews to produce music by direct digital computation, which could be heard by converting samples to audible sound using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). MUSIC IV was further expanded by Godfrey Winham and Hubert Howe into MUSIC IVB, and then into MUSIC IVBF, a more portable version written in FORTRAN.

While employed as an assistant professor at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music (1965-1967) and as the Contemporary Music Project's Seattle/Tacoma composer-in-residence (1967-1968), he earned his A.Mus.D. in composition from the University of Michigan (where he studied with Ross Lee Finney) in 1968. Prior to taking these positions, Vercoe supported his doctoral studies by working as a staff statistician at Michigan; it was in this capacity that first acquired an aptitude for computer programming by learning MAD. In 1965, he married fellow composer and Michigan graduate student Elizabeth Vercoe; they had two children before divorcing in the early 1990s. During a summer respite from his doctoral studies and a subsequent two-year postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton University under Godfrey Winham, his research in digital audio processing paved the way for the subsequent evolution of digital musical composition. From 1970 to 1971, he served as a visiting lecturer at the Yale School of Music."]}, {"page": "Computer Music Center", "response": ["By the late 1970s the Electronic Music Center was rapidly nearing obsolescence as the classical analog tape techniques it used were being surpassed by parallel work in the field of computer music.

Multiplication originated intuitively in interval expansion, including tone row order number rotation, for example in the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Alban Berg. Pitch number rotation, F\u00fcnferreihe or \"five-series\" and Siebenerreihe or \"seven-series\", was first described by Ernst Krenek in \u00dcber neue Musik.
