He is most closely associated with Colin McRae, with whom he won the 1995 World Rally Championship.\nAlthough their partnership extended back to the 1980s when McRae was a teenager, the two split at the end of 1996 when they failed to defend their title, several mid-season crashes being blamed on Ringer. After a year's absence, Ringer returned to partner Martin Rowe in the British Rally Championship, the pair winning the 1998 title in a Renault M\u00e9gane Maxi and competing together in the World Rally Championship in 1999.\nRinger then moved on to Mitsubishi for two years, before McRae's split with replacement co-driver Nicky Grist in 2002 reunited the two Scots for 2003. However, the partnership did not yield fresh success and both men lost their seats at Citro\u00ebn. McRae competed in only three more world rallies, partnered by Nicky Grist on each occasion.\nIn February 2008, Ringer served as Travis Pastrana's interim co-driver beginning with the second-round, 100 Acre Wood event on 22 February.  Pastrana's former co-driver, Christian Edstrom announced his retirement from rallying after one race in January.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 11", "response": ["*  1956   \u2013 Derek Ringer, Scottish race car driver"]}, {"page": "Monte Carlo Rally", "response": ["|  Colin McRae   Derek Ringer ||  Citro\u00ebn Total   Citro\u00ebn Xsara WRC"]}, {"page": "Wales Rally GB", "response": ["|  Colin McRae Derek Ringer", "|  Colin McRae Derek Ringer"]}, {"page": "Rally Sweden", "response": ["|  Colin McRae Derek Ringer ||  Subaru Rally Team Europe Subaru Legacy RS", "|  Colin McRae Derek Ringer ||  555 Subaru World Rally Team Subaru Legacy RS", "|  Colin McRae Derek Ringer ||  555 Subaru World Rally Team Subaru Impreza 555"]}, {"page": "Ringer", "response": ["* Derek Ringer (born 1956), Scottish rally co-driver"]}, {"page": "Colin McRae", "response": ["| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer"]}, {"page": "Rally New Zealand", "response": ["| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer", "| Derek Ringer"]}, {"page": "Acropolis Rally", "response": ["|1996||  Colin McRae Derek Ringer ||  Subaru Impreza 555 || WRC"]}, {"page": "Rally de Catalunya", "response": ["|  Colin McRae Derek Ringer"]}, {"page": "Rally Australia", "response": ["|  Derek Ringer"]}, {"page": "Pirelli Richard Burns Foundation Rally", "response": ["|  Derek Ringer"]}, {"page": "Travis Pastrana", "response": ["February 19, 2007 brought news that Pastrana's longtime co-driver Edstrom had announced a sabbatical to concentrate on his career and family.

In 1999 Grist and McRae moved from Subaru to the M-sport Ford team of Malcolm Wilson, Grist's driver during the 1990 to 1991 WRC seasons, where they had two consecutive wins at the Safari Rally and Rally Portugal. However, due to reliability issues with the new Ford Focus WRC they only managed to finish 6th in the WRC with 23 points. The 1999 season of retirements only finished in the February 2000 when they finished 3rd in the Swedish Rally. However, even with two wins and three seconds to support Sweden's third place a further 6 retirements after the initial Monte Carlo Rally retirement meant that they ended up 4th in the championship with 43 points overall.

The season ended with a 2nd place in the championship and 42 points, two points behind fellow Brit, his arch rival Richard Burns. 2002 was Grist's last competitive season of WRC, and again saw him co-drive for McRae and Ford. During this year, there were 4 retirements and 2 wins, one of these being the Acropolis Rally, making four consecutive wins in Greece, and the other being the last Safari Rally, on its 50th anniversary.
