For example, Oppy says arguing for naturalism is an argument for atheism since naturalism and theism \"cannot both be true\". Fiona Ellis says that while Oppy's view is common, it is dependent on a narrow view of naturalism. She describes the \"expansive naturalism\" of John McDowell, James Griffin and David Wiggins as giving \"due respect to scientific findings\" while also asserting there are things in human experience which cannot be explained in such terms, such as the concept of value, leaving room for theism.  Christopher C. Knight asserts a theistic naturalism that relies on what he terms an \"incarnational naturalism\" (the doctrine of immanence) and does not require any special mode of divine action that would put it outside nature. Nevertheless, Oppy argues that a strong naturalism favors atheism, though he finds the best direct arguments against theism to be the evidential problem of evil, and arguments concerning the contradictory nature of God were He to exist."]}, {"page": "Brad Hooker", "response": ["Hooker initially studied philosophy at Princeton University, before pursuing his BPhil and DPhil at the University of Oxford from 1981 to 1986, where he was a member of St Anne's College, and was taught and supervised by Derek Parfit, James Griffin, and Richard Hare.https://www.linkedin.com/pub/brad-hooker/3a/917/705"]}, {"page": "Index of contemporary philosophy articles", "response": ["* James Griffin (philosopher)"]}, {"page": "British Society for Ethical Theory", "response": ["* 1998: University of Kent.

Frankena, for example, wrote that we desire health \"for its own sake\",Frankena Op.cit.13, pp.82,87 and Zimmerman wrote that \"Being healthy is just a good way to be\".Zimmerman Op.cit.2  The value that we ascribe to life itself and the value of \"just being\" have been mentioned previously, but it was Hartmann who reintroduced the notion from earlier German philosophy that Being has a complementary category, namely that of Becoming.Hartmann Op.cit.21; cf. Schopenhauer Op.cit.23  Everything is subject to change over time, and without human intervention, is subject to deterioration and decay. In relation to this, Mason referred to Immanuel Kant one of whose principal values lay in duty, particularly, in this respect, duty to self, and looking after the \"basic stuff\" through physical exercise and maintenance.Kant I The Metaphysics of Morals, 1797 (tr. Gregor M., Cambridge University Press, 1996)  Plato had also thought that the right way of living lay in \"medicine, bathing and exercise\"Plato Op.cit.16 but Kant added to this idea by saying that value also lay in self-improvement through the cultivation of any \"natural talents and gifts of fortune\" that a person might possess.Kant Op.cit.73  James Griffin in his book on Well-Being [1986] similarly introduced the value of \"accomplishment\" and how, in Aristotle's terminology, we might grow and \"flourish\" in other ways.Griffin J. Well-Being: Its Meaning, Measurement and Moral Importance (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986) pp.35,57", "Regarding the end at which people aim, Bentham, according to Elinor Mason, thought that the sole end was that of \"pleasure\", and that all other values such as beauty, friendship, knowledge etc. could be measured in accordance with the quantity of pleasure which each might afford.Mason Op.cit.1  John Stuart Mill suggested that there were lower and higher pleasures and that these were fundamentally incommensurable. He went on to question, like Plato, whether the values of pleasure or satisfaction were in fact the ends at which intelligent people should aim.Ibid; cf. Plato Op.cit.16, p.505b  Mason also refers to James Griffin who was of the opinion that \"well-being\" was a better name for such an end, and which he saw in terms of \"flourishing\" or a \"maximisation of life\" in all its aspects.Griffin Op.cit.76, pp.34,57  A \"balancing of elements\" is required whereby those activities which we value for well-being, such as work, rest, love, solitude, health, accomplishment etc. should be considered \"in various combinations\" in order to afford a \"framework\" or a \"plan of life\" for ourselves.Ibid., p.58; cf. Dewey Op.cit.35, p.47 re \u201cframework\u201d  This way of thinking was called by Elizabeth Anderson, in her article on John Dewey, \"objective list theory\" as opposed to theories like Bentham's based on pleasure or those of  Dewey based on \"informed desire\".Anderson E. Dewey\u2019s Moral Philosophy, 2005 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2014)  Dewey rejected the notion of a final end arguing instead that the \"value of means and ends are reciprocally determined\".Dewey Op.cit.35, pp.24,40ff  According to Zimmerman, he challenged traditional metaphysical ideas with a more \"pragmatic\" approach saying that only through \"calm, informed reflection\" on the ways in which people \"interact with the environment\" and deal with the ensuing consequences can value be ascertained.Zimmerman Op.cit.2; cf. Dewey Op.cit.35, p.30"]}]}}
