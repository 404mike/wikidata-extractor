From a funeral elegy by William Rowley, upon the death of Hugh Atwell, \"servant of Prince Charles\", on 25 September 1621, he has been accounted an actor of some note. In the \"Alleyn Papers\" Atwell's name is mentioned as the witness of a loan from Philip Henslowe to Robert Daborne of twenty shillings in 1613. Atwell's name also appears as one of Alleyn's company, applying to him for an advance of money. Another player of the same surname in Henslowe's company, George Attwell, has been regarded as the father of Hugh Atwell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Children of the Chapel", "response": ["*Hugh Atwell, one of the \"Children of her Majesty's Revels\""]}, {"page": "Hugh Attawel", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Atwell"]}, {"page": "Hugh Attewell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Atwell"]}, {"page": "Atwell (surname)", "response": ["*Hugh Atwell (?\u20131621), English actor"]}]}}
