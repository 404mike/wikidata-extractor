He played 285 games in all competitions for Birmingham, including 261 Football League First Division games and an appearance at Wembley in the 1931 FA Cup Final, before trying his hand at management. \nHe began his managerial career as player-manager at Midland League club Boston United, before becoming Banbury Spencer manager in 1936, a position he held until retiring in 1961.Cringan died in 1972. He was the younger brother of Willie Cringan, captain of Celtic and Scotland. Another brother Robert played for Ayr United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boston United F.C.", "response": ["| Jimmy Cringan"]}, {"page": "Banbury United F.C.", "response": ["| 1936\u20131961 ||  Jimmy Cringan"]}, {"page": "1931 FA Cup Final", "response": ["In the days leading up to the final, both teams made use of mid-week games to test players who were doubtful due to injury. Following Birmingham's reserve match against Huddersfield Town's reserves, George Briggs and Jimmy Cringan were pronounced fit to play in the final, but centre forward Joe Bradford's fitness was not decided until the Thursday morning. An injured knee had kept Bradford out of action since mid-March, and he played with the knee well bandaged during the match, which was played in front of \"about 12,000\" spectators at St Andrew's. Full back Bert Trentham was a doubt for Albion, but came through the first half of their friendly against Headingly \"quite satisfactorily\". The Birmingham team prepared for the final at Bushey, while the West Bromwich Albion team were based in Harrow. Both teams visited The Cenotaph in the week before the final, in order to lay wreaths.", "In the sixth minute, Bob Gregg headed Jimmy Cringan's free kick past the stranded West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, but the linesman flagged Gregg offside and the goal was disallowed; newspaper reports suggest the decision was incorrect.The Daily Mail match report, reproduced in Thraves, pp.\u00a024\u201325. Albion took the lead after 24 minutes when Joe Carter received the ball from Tommy Glidden and took it almost to the by-line before crossing it. As W. G. Richardson attempted a shot he fell, but Birmingham's Ned Barkas inadvertently touched the ball back to him and away from his goalkeeper, and Richardson was able to recover sufficiently to steer it home. Joe Bradford and Johnny Crosbie both missed good chances for Birmingham before half-time.Matthews (1995), p.\u00a019.", "|Half-back ||Jimmy Cringan"]}, {"page": "Charlie Calladine", "response": ["Calladine made his Football League debut on 11 April 1931 away to Huddersfield Town, playing at centre forward in a 1\u20130 defeat. He played twice the following season, again in the forward line, but did not reappear for another twelve months. When Jimmy Cringan was injured ahead of a demanding Christmas programme of matches, Calladine was selected at left half for the visit of Portsmouth on 24 December 1932. Birmingham won 4\u20130, and Calladine had found his position. Described as a physically strong player, vigorous in style, with a powerful shot, and possessing \"quickness and cleverness\", he missed only one match in what remained of the season. In March 1933, the Sheffield-based Daily Independent reported that he was \"being regarded as a candidate for the left half position in the England team.\" He was ever-present in Birmingham's 1933\u201334 season and missed four matches in the next. After the first seven matches of the 1935\u201336 season produced only one win, Calladine lost his place, and when the team started winning, he did not get it back. He played twice more, on the left wing, and scored once, in a draw away to Derby County on 16 November which was the last of his 126 appearances for Birmingham."]}, {"page": "Dickie Dale (footballer)", "response": ["Over the next three seasons, he played in 75 League matches, not always first choice in the starting eleven but always first choice as cover for any half-back position. Often noted for his enthusiasm and work-rate, and sometimes for his judgment, he was at his peak from 1925 to 1926, having dislodged Barton to the covering role in the latter part of the 1925\u201326 season and retained the left-half position for much of the following campaign. In September 1927, he stood in successfully for Jimmy Cringan at centre half, but played little during the rest of the season. Early in the 1928\u201329 season, Dale stood in for the injured Barton for seven games, and was reported to have \"[given] a good account of himself\" in a goalless draw away against Arsenal, but he was soon to move on. He had played 151 matches in League and FA Cup but, despite the Sports Argus correspondent's view some four years earlier that he was \"fast developing into a good shot\", never scored."]}, {"page": "Jock Morgan", "response": ["Morgan was born in Penicuik, Midlothian. He began his football career with Edinburgh Emmett and then came to England to sign for Birmingham of the First Division in August 1924. He played only once for Birmingham, deputising for the injured Jimmy Cringan and his regular understudy Bill Hunter at centre half in a 4\u20130 defeat at Sunderland on 6 September 1924.Matthews, p. 167. After a brief spell in non-league football with Redditch Town he settled at Doncaster Rovers, where he played 150 Third Division North games in four seasons. After one Second Division game in one-and-a-half seasons for Bristol City, a return to the Third with Barrow offered more playing time. Short spells with Walsall and Southport and a venture to Ireland with Brideville preceded a return to non-league football in the English Midlands with Worcester City and Atherstone Town."]}, {"page": "Bernard Smith (footballer)", "response": ["At the start of the 1932\u201333 season, Birmingham's regular left back Ned Barkas was recovering from an appendicitis operation, so left-half Jimmy Cringan took his position. Cringan broke a collarbone in his first game, and was replaced by reserve left-back Jack Randle, who played four games before Smith, the second reserve, was drafted in for his debut at Derby County on 17 September 1932, which finished as a 2\u20132 draw. This was the first of a run of games, but when the experienced Barkas returned to the side Smith could not dislodge him.Matthews, p. 175."]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["After six minutes of the final, Bob Gregg's header from Jimmy Cringan's free kick was ruled offside; newspaper reports suggest the decision was incorrect. After 24 minutes, Ned Barkas deflected W. G. Richardson's shot away from Hibbs and Richardson steered it home. Chances were missed by both sides before Joe Bradford equalised with a  shot. But straight from the restart, Albion ran the ball down the field, George Liddell sliced his clearance to Richardson's feet, and the forward scored from close range.\"The Cup.
