During the 1990s he was the world's third most cited professor (and the second most cited in the fields of biology and biochemistry) and has been described by Professor Garry Taylor of the University of St Andrews as \"one of the world\u2019s top scientists\". and by Professor Sir Peter Downes as \"arguably the UK's leading biochemist and an iconic figure in UK science\". As of 2008 he has written over 470 peer-reviewed papers and given over 250 invited lectures in 33 countries, and has been repeatedly linked to a move of biotechnology companies to Dundee and the economic regeneration that came with it, to the point where 15% of the local economy is derived from biotech companies and their employees. His work has also seen Dundee attracting some of the world's best scientists, with over 1% of the world's most cited scientists residing in Dundee and fundraising of more than \u00a335 million over the last 10 years to help attract them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 22", "response": ["*1945 \u2013 Philip Cohen, English biochemist and academic"]}, {"page": "List of biochemists", "response": ["* Philip Cohen FRS (b. 1945).
