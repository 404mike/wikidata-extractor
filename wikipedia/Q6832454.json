He was also a teaching fellow at Clare College, Cambridge. He was an enthusiast in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and became a world authority in his field of insect evolutionary biology. He was widely noted for his work on moths and ladybirds and as an advocate of the science of evolution. He was also an enthusiastic educator and the author of several books on insects, evolution and sexual reproduction. He is best remembered as an ardent supporter and champion of experiments on peppered moth evolution.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peppered moth", "response": ["A mating pair or a lone individual will spend the day hiding from predators, particularly birds.

He predicted that environmental condition can favour the increase or decline of either the dominant (in this case the black or melanic forms) or the recessive (the grey or wild type) moths. For a sooty environment such as Manchester, where the phenomenon was discovered in 1848, he predicted that the dominant melanic moths will have fifty times more survival fitness than the typical grey ones. According to his estimate, assuming 1% dominant form in 1848 and about 99% in 1898, \"48 generations are needed for the change [for the dominant to appear]... After only 13 generations the dominants would be in a majority.\" Such mathematical prediction was considered improbable for natural selection in nature. But it was subsequently proven by an elaborate experiment (named Kettlewell's experiment) performed by an Oxford zoologist Bernard Kettlewell between 1953 and 1958, and further by a Cambridge geneticists Michael Majerus in his experiments conducted between 2001 and 2007."]}, {"page": "Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood", "response": ["* Michael Majerus (1954\u20132009) geneticist, entomologist, Professor of Evolution at the University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "E.
