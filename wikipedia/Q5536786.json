The company was founded in Sheffield by George Bassett in 1842. Perhaps the company's best-known sweets, the Liquorice Allsorts, were created by accident in 1899 and in 1926 the mascot of Bassett's, Bertie Bassett, was created; Bertie continues to represent the brand today. In 2016, the brand was joined with Maynards to create Maynards Bassetts.", "The Sheffield Directory of 1842 records George Bassett as being \"wholesale confectioner, lozenge maker and British wine trader\". In 1851, Bassett took on an apprentice called Samuel Meggitt Johnson, who later became Bassett's son-in-law. His descendants ran the company until Gordon Johnson retired as chairman in the 1970s. Bassett's was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1929. They opened up a factory in Broad Street, Sheffield in 1852. The site moved in 1933 to Owlerton in another district of the city and remains there today. Unclaimed Babies were being produced during the 19th century, especially in the North West of  England. In 1918, Bassetts launched their own range of the soft sweets which they called Peace Babies. They were re-launched as Jelly Babies in the 1950s and were allegedly thrown at the Beatles during concerts as they were a favourite of George Harrison."]}, {"page": "William John Hale", "response": ["A further three Wesleyan chapels were built to his designs at Brightside, Low Bradfield and St Luke's at Crookes in the years up to 1900. The Ibbotson family were generous benefactors to the Low Bradfied project, allowing Hale to indulge in detailing which  a small village could not otherwise have afforded. A similar situation arose at St Luke's with Samuel Meggitt Johnson, owner of the George Bassett confectionery company, who paid for the entire cost, with Hale finishing the building with some flair and facing the building with Bole Hill stone and a Matlock stone dressing, with intricate carving by Frank Tory."]}, {"page": "Bassett (surname)", "response": ["* George Bassett (1818\u20131886), British confectioner and mayor of Sheffield"]}, {"page": "George Bassett (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Bassett (1818\u20131886) was an English businessman.", "George Bassett or Basset may also refer to:", "*George Bassett (Australian politician) (1888\u20131972), New South Wales politician", "*George Bassett, character in The Rockford Files (season 5)"]}, {"page": "Bassett, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Bassett"]}, {"page": "List of artwork at the Minnesota State Capitol", "response": ["| Bust  ||  150x150px|| 1977  || Hubert H.
