At least 7,500 lithographs were published in the firm's 72 years of operation. Artists produced two to three new images every week for 64 years (1834\u20131895), producing more than a million prints by hand-colored lithography. For the original drawings, Currier & Ives employed or used the work of many celebrated artists of the day including James E. Buttersworth, Charles R. Parsons, George Inness, Thomas Nast, C.H. Moore, and Eastman Johnson. The stars of the firm were Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait, who specialized in sporting scenes; Louis Maurer, who executed genre scenes; George H. Durrie, who supplied winter scenes; and Frances Flora Bond Palmer, who liked to do picturesque panoramas of the American landscape, and who was the first woman in the United States to make her living as a full-time artist."]}, {"page": "Francis Palmer", "response": ["*Frances Flora Bond Palmer, English artist"]}, {"page": "Fanny Palmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frances Flora Bond Palmer"]}, {"page": "Frances Flora Palmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frances Flora Bond Palmer"]}]}}
