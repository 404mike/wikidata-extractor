Ferguson succeeded to the baronetcy in July 1808, after his father was killed in accident on a bridge in Moville, County Donegal. Ferguson was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge where he graduated MA in 1817.  He was Colonel of the County Militia and Lord Lieutenant of County Londonderry from 1840 to 1860. He lived at The Farm, County Londonderry.\n\nHe was appointed High Sheriff of Donegal in 1818 and High Sheriff of Tyrone in 1825 and then elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Londonderry City at the 1830 general election, but his election was declared void. A member of the United University club, he was re-elected at the resulting by-election held on 2 April 1831, and held the seat until his death in 1860, at the age of 63, when the baronetcy became extinct. In 1859 he voted in favour of the Derby ministry's reform bill.\nThere is a statue of Ferguson in Brooke Park in his native Derry.", "link_mentions": {}}}
