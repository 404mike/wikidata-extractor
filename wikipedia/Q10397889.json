He played as a right half.\nJackson joined Sheffield United from local amateur side Atlas & Norfolk Works in 1932. He started in the third team, but within two years, he made his debut in a First Division match against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Bramall Lane on 11 February 1933.\nHe did not win a regular place in the side until 1936, and, but for World War II, would have enjoyed twelve full season for the side. He resumed his playing career with Sheffield United after the war in 1946, and retired a few years later. In total he made 229 appearances for Sheffield United with 8 goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jock Dodds", "response": ["His debut came on 15 September 1934, against Burnley but despite playing and scoring regularly in the following months, the club was unconvinced that he was yet of first-team quality. The club made an enquiry into the return of former player Jimmy Dunne, who found himself out of favour at Arsenal after he had been sold, but this came to nothing due to a cartilage injury. Dodds secured his position by scoring four goals in the next game, a 6\u20131 victory against Southampton on 16 February 1935. His prolific goalscoring helped the club reached the 1936 FA Cup Final, in which almost scored, hitting the crossbar with a header. It was said by Ernest Jackson that he would have scored nine times out of ten from such a position and Dodds himself claimed that he had been pushed in the back by Wilf Copping.Clarebrough, Denis (1989).
