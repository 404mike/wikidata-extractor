With 17 minutes of the match remaining, Trautmann suffered a serious injury while diving at the feet of Birmingham City's Peter Murphy. Despite his injury, he continued to play, making crucial saves to preserve his team's 3\u20131 lead. His neck was noticeably crooked as he collected his winner's medal; three days later an X-ray revealed it to be broken.", "During the previous final, nerves had contributed to the opposition scoring an early goal, but the City team was more settled on this occasion. Under the influence of Don Revie who was outstanding on the day, City scored an early goal, a left-footed strike by Joe Hayes. Birmingham equalised on 14\u00a0minutes. The match remained level until midway through the second half, when Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone scored two goals in as many minutes to give Manchester City a 3\u20131 lead. Birmingham attacked strongly in the next ten minutes. In the 75th minute, Trautmann, diving at an incoming ball, was knocked out in a collision with Birmingham's Peter Murphy in which he was hit in the neck by Murphy's right knee. No substitutes were permitted in those days, so Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, carried on. For the remaining 15\u00a0minutes he defended his net, making a crucial interception to deny Murphy once more. Manchester City held on for the victory, and Trautmann was the hero because of his spectacular saves in the last minutes of the match. Trautmann admitted later that he had spent the last part of the match \"in a kind of fog\".", "Media outlets have since recognised Trautmann's reputation. ESPN consider Trautmann as one of the greatest FA Cup goalkeepers, with Trautmann representing Manchester City in two consecutive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956 while his lunge at Peter Murphy's feet to grasp the ball in the 1956 FA Cup Final is rated as the greatest FA Cup save; a save that broke Trautmann's neck."]}, {"page": "Inter-Cities Fairs Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Peter Murphy"]}, {"page": "1956 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Birmingham City entered the match as favourites, in a contest billed as a contrast of styles.

Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3\u20131 victory.

In the fourth round, Leyton Orient, who had beaten Birmingham at the same stage four years earlier, posed more of a potential problem. In reality the win was equally comfortable: Eddy Brown added two goals to his hat-trick at Torquay. A tight local derby game followed on a snow-covered frozen pitch at The Hawthorns. In the first half, goalkeeper Gil Merrick and his defence did well to keep West Bromwich Albion out; Trevor Smith had to clear a Ronnie Allen header from under the crossbar. In the second half, Birmingham wasted several chances before a one-two with Brown allowed Peter Murphy to score from the edge of the penalty area.", "During the half-time interval, a row erupted between the Birmingham manager and some of his players about their fitness; in the Manchester City dressing room, a heated exchange took place between Barnes and Revie. Barnes had played defensively in the first half to counter the threat of Peter Murphy, but Revie urged him to play further forward.Wagg & Barnes, This Simple Game, pp.\u00a058\u201359, \"'Where the fuck have you been, Ken?'

The first came when Llu\u00eds Coll's corner was headed home by Eulogio Mart\u00ednez, and a neat move was finished off by Zolt\u00e1n Czibor who received a  lofted pass on the edge of the penalty area, swivelled, and shot home for the second. Despite numerous corners, there was no further score in the first half, and prompted by the \"tireless\" Johnny Gordon, Birmingham had attempted to combat Barcelona in midfield. But shortly after the interval, Barcelona attacked down the right and Mart\u00ednez passed to Czibor whose second goal killed the game. Gordon Astall had two chances at goal, the former going wide and the latter being deflected in spectacular fashion by Ramallets, before another attack down the right flank allowed Mart\u00ednez to feed Coll, whose \"fierce right-foot drive through a crowd of players\" gave Barcelona a four-goal lead. With little time left, Peter Murphy, making his last appearance for Birmingham, counter-attacked down the left and sent a long cross-field pass towards Hooper, whose mobility helped him beat Ramallets to the ball and score with a header.", "|IL||10|| Peter Murphy", "Birmingham stayed on in Spain for a post-season tour. They were invited to play Third Division Atl\u00e9tico Baleares in honour of the opening of the club's new stadium in Palma de Mallorca, but the game was abandoned with \"scuffles going on all over the field\" after two Birmingham men, Peter Murphy and Dick Neal, were sent off, the former for a foul on the hosts' captain, Cresp\u00ed, that broke his leg so badly that he was forced to retire from football. The players' reputation both footballing and behavioural was to some extent redeemed in a charity match in aid of the \"Pro Suburbios\" campaign against slum housing, a 1\u20131 draw with a Sevilla XI that El Mundo Deportivo's sub-editor thought would not go down in history. But the trouble in Mallorca, combined with two sendings-off in this edition of the Fairs Cup and another in a friendly in Switzerland, resulted in the Football Association telling the Birmingham club that they \"cannot play overseas until [they] have given firm undertakings to uphold the prestige and reputation of British clubs and the F.A. at all times\"."]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-four players made at least one appearance in nationally or internationally organised first-team competition, and there were thirteen different goalscorers.

The score at half time in the first leg of the semi-final, at St Andrew's, was 3\u20133, and Peter Murphy scored the winner after an hour. In the away leg, in the recently opened Camp Nou, El Mundo Deportivo expected a comfortable victory for the hosts, but the result was rather less clear-cut. The only goal of the game was scored after 82 minutes by Kubala, who saw Gil Merrick off his line and neatly lobbed him. With no away goals rule, the game went into 30 minutes of extra time, which remained goalless, so a replay was to be played on a neutral ground. Controversy arose when Birmingham were prevented from substituting the injured Bunny Larkin, contrary to what they believed had been agreed before the match; Barcelona manager Dom\u00e8nec Balmanya claimed the agreement allowed for two substitutes, but outfield players could only be replaced in the first half. Asked what he thought of Barcelona, Birmingham trainer Dave Fairhurst said he thought they played better in the first leg, where they concentrated on playing; here, they spent too much time complaining. Balmanya's opinion of Birmingham had not changed since the first leg: he saw them as a physical team with crude technique, too concerned with the opponent to think much about the ball."]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["Bob Brocklebank and chief scout Walter Taylor laid the foundations for the club's successes of the 1950s, introducing future England internationals Trevor Smith and Jeff Hall to the side, and bringing in the likes of Peter Murphy, Eddy Brown, Roy Warhurst and Alex Govan.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 61.", "Twenty-five players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were eleven different goalscorers.
