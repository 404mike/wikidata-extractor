He was born in Lille, France, where his Leeds-based father had a factory, and was educated at Leeds Grammar School. He built extensions to Tower Works in Holbeck in 1899 and the 1920s and, when City Square was remodelled, proposed and financed the sculptures including the Black Prince .\nHe used the title \"Colonel\" after the Leeds Artillery Volunteers gave him the title of Honorary Colonel when he retired after 33 years service in 1893.\nHe was Lord Mayor of Leeds in 1898\u201399, and was created a Freeman of the City of Leeds in 1903. He moved from his home in Abbey House (originally the Kirkstall Abbey gatehouse) to Hartsholme Hall in Lincolnshire (1902) and Madingley Hall in Cambridgeshire (1906), which he restored. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in March 1901, and Deputy Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire in April 1901.Harding was also a writer. He published The Abbot of Kirkstall in 1926, a novel about the Black Prince, John of Gaunt, and  John Wycliffe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire", "response": ["* Thomas Walter Harding 2 April 1901"]}, {"page": "City Square, Leeds", "response": ["Proposals were made in 1893 to transform the area in front of the station. The demolition of Leeds' Coloured Cloth Hall and Quebec House gave an open space in which a new General Post Office was constructed in 1896 with a public space in front. One proposal was to name the development after John Smeaton, the famous local engineer, but the council unanimously opted to call it City Square, as Leeds was being made a city that year. The initial plan had tramway waiting rooms, and public lavatories welcoming new visitors to Leeds. However, Colonel Thomas Walter Harding (Lord Mayor of Leeds between 1898-9) was so dismayed that he commissioned William Bakewell to design a square more in the style of an Italian piazza, with statues and trees.", "The large equestrian statue is of Edward, the Black Prince (1330\u20131376), and is a major work of Thomas Brock (1847\u20131922). Edward had no specific connection with Leeds, and the choice of subject therefore caused something of a stir. The statue is on a pedestal with relief panels depicting some of the prince's notable victories. It (along with most of the statues) was funded by Colonel Thomas Walter Harding. Brock took seven years to make it, and it had to be cast in Belgium because it was too big for any British foundry. It was carried by sea to Hull, then on a barge along the River Aire to Leeds. It was unveiled on 16 September 1903 to cheering crowds.  It is Grade II* listed.", "Dr Walter Hook (1798\u20131875) was a vicar of Leeds and a major influence on both religion and education in the city.  He was responsible for rebuilding the parish church (now Leeds Minster) and thirty schools. This was erected in 1902.  It is by F. W. Pomeroy and the gift of Colonel Thomas Walter Harding.", "The famous chemist and theologian Joseph Priestley lived in Leeds from 1767 to 1773, and was the minister at Mill Hill Chapel, which is on the square.  He used carbon dioxide from the local brewery to continue his experiments on gases.  This was erected in 1903. It is by Alfred Drury and the gift of Colonel Thomas Walter Harding."]}, {"page": "Thomas Harding (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Thomas Walter Harding (1843\u20131927), English industrialist and civic figure"]}, {"page": "Scotland Forever!", "response": ["In 1888 Colonel Thomas Walter Harding donated the painting to Leeds Art Gallery.http://www.leedsartgallery.co.uk/gallery/listings/l0081.php "]}, {"page": "1902 Leeds North by-election", "response": ["The Conservatives considered a number of possible candidates including Colonel Thomas Walter Harding, a Liberal Unionist who had contested West Leeds against Herbert Gladstone and was a former Lord Mayor of Leeds;  F.

It was a gift from Colonel Thomas Walter Harding, Lord Mayor of Leeds between 1898 and 1899. The choice was probably also a tribute to the future Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, who opened Leeds Infirmary in 1867 and the Yorkshire College buildings (now the University of Leeds) in 1885. The statue is the centrepiece of an array of statues in the square, including more local people such as Joseph Priestley."]}]}}
