Firstly, some 300 native landowners who had taken the English side in the Nine Years' War were rewarded with land grants.Lenihan p 46 Secondly, the majority of the Gaelic Irish remained in their native areas, but were now only allowed worse land than before the plantation.

The main reason for this was that Undertakers could not import enough English or Scottish tenants to fill their agricultural workforce and had to fall back on Irish tenants.Canny, p 233\u2013235 However, in a few heavily populated lowland areas (such as parts of north Armagh) it is likely that some population displacement occurred.Elliott, p 93.", "The attempted conversion of the Irish to Protestantism was generally a failure. One problem was language difference. The Protestant clerics imported were usually all monoglot English speakers, whereas the native population were usually monoglot Irish speakers. However, ministers chosen to serve in the plantation were required to take a course in the Irish language before ordination, and nearly 10% of those who took up their preferments spoke it fluently.Padraig O Snodaigh. Nevertheless, conversion was rare, despite the fact that, after 1621, Gaelic Irish natives could be officially classed as British if they converted to Protestantism.Lenihan p 49 Of those Catholics who did convert to Protestantism, many made their choice for social and political reasons.Marianne Elliott.", "By the 1630s it is suggested that the plantation was settling down with \"tacit religious tolerance\", and in every county Old Irish were serving as royal officials and members of the Irish Parliament.Marianne Elliott: The Catholics of Ulster: A History. New York, Basic Books. 2001. Page 97. However, in the 1640s, the Ulster Plantation was thrown into turmoil by civil wars that raged in Ireland, England and Scotland. The wars saw Irish rebellion against the planters, twelve years of bloody war, and ultimately the re-conquest of the province by the English parliamentary New Model Army that confirmed English and Protestant dominance in the province.Canny p577-578", "On 23 October 1641, the Ulster Catholics staged a rebellion. The mobilised natives turned on the British colonists, massacring about 4000 and expelling about 8,000 more. Marianne Elliott believes that \"1641 destroyed the Ulster Plantation as a mixed settlement\".Marianne Elliott: The Catholics of Ulster: A History. New York, Basic Books. 2001. Page 102. The initial leader of the rebellion, Felim O'Neill, had actually been a beneficiary of the Plantation land grants. Most of his supporters' families had been dispossessed and were likely motivated by the desire to recover their ancestral lands.  Many colonists who survived rushed to the seaports and went back to Great Britain.Brian MacCuarta,Age of Atrocity p155, Canny p177", "* Marianne Elliott, Catholics of Ulster: A History"]}, {"page": "Irish Rebellion of 1798", "response": ["Contemporary estimates put the death toll from 20,000 (Dublin Castle) to as many as 50,000 of which 2,000 were military and 1,000 loyalist civilians.Richard Musgrave \"Memoirs of the different rebellions in Ireland\" (1801) (see Appendices) Some modern research argues that these figures may be too high. Firstly, a list of British soldiers killed, compiled for a fund to aid the families of dead soldiers, listed just 530 names. Secondly, professor Louis Cullen, through an examination of depletion of the population in County Wexford between 1798 and 1820, put the fatalities in that county due to the rebellion at 6,000. Historian Thomas Bartlett therefore argues, \"a death toll of 10,000 for the entire island would seem to be in order\".Bartlett in Smyth, ed, p100 Other modern historians believe that the death toll may be even higher than contemporary estimates suggest as the widespread fear of repression among relatives of slain rebels led to mass concealment of casualties.Marianne Elliott, \"Rebellion, a Television history of 1798\" (RT\u00c9 1998)"]}, {"page": "List of Irish historians", "response": ["* Marianne Elliott"]}, {"page": "Plantations of Ireland", "response": ["The Plantation of Ulster was a mixed success for the English.
