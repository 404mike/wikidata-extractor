He was subsequently removed from the transfer list by the following manager, Brian Laws. Whelan repaid the faith shown in him with seven goals. He then went on to win a number of player of the year awards for the club's 2006\u201307 season. His performances led to manager Laws entering into contract negotiations with Whelan. Sheffield Wednesday rejected bids for Whelan from both Burnley and Plymouth Argyle in January 2008.

One of his first moves was to appoint another ex-Crewe player and former Bala teammate Kenny Lunt as assistant manager. With his side facing the possibility of relegation out of EFL League Two after a 4\u20130 defeat at Hartlepool United on 28 February, Artell warned his players that \"relegation means oblivion... they'll end up in the Conference North on \u00a3200 a week with a job as a milkman.\" Crewe promptly won four of their next five games in March to move towards mid-table safety, a team performance that helped earn Artell a nomination for EFL League Two Manager of the Month. The \"Railwaymen\" ended the 2016\u201317 campaign in 17th place, and Artell released six players in the summer. He warned the remaining out-of-contract players to sign their new contracts quickly before he withdrew their offers, but said \"we all had a say. It's not a dictatorship. I'm not Idi Amin or Pol Pot... it's evolution, not revolution, but we won't be happy with 17th in the table again next season\"."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["| 8 May 2009 ||Kenny Lunt||Hereford United||Released"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Hereford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| 6 ||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Kenny Lunt", "|  Kenny Lunt"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Hereford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| 16 ||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Kenny Lunt"]}, {"page": "Crewe Alexandra F.C.
