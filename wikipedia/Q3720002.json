During the  political crisis which led to the English Civil War,  Sir Edward remained  entirely loyal to the Crown, but admitted that he found great difficulty in raising the gentry of Yorkshire to fight for the Royalist cause.  In addition he was deeply distraught by the death of his eldest son, who was killed in 1638  when the roof of  the family house fell in; Thomas, his only surviving son, was said to have survived because he was looking for his pet cat under a table at the time of the accident.\nOsborne married firstly  13 October 1618  Margaret Belasyse, who died 7 November 1624, daughter of Thomas Belasyse, 1st Viscount Fauconberg and Barbara Cholmondeley,  by whom he has a son, Edward, who was killed accidentally  in 1638,  when the roof of the family home fell in.
