He was one of the leading poets of the First World War. His war poetry on the horrors of trenches and gas warfare was much influenced by his mentor Siegfried Sassoon and stood in contrast to the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke. Among his best-known works \u2013 most of which were published posthumously \u2013 are \"Dulce et Decorum est\", \"Insensibility\", \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\", \"Futility\", \"Spring Offensive\" and \"Strange Meeting\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Wilfred Owen (1893\u20131918, E)"]}, {"page": "Horace", "response": ["Yet for men like Wilfred Owen, scarred by experiences of World War I, his poetry stood for discredited values:", "Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, though formally derived from the Persian ruba'i, nevertheless shows a strong Horatian influence, since, as one modern scholar has observed, \"...the quatrains inevitably recall the stanzas of the 'Odes', as does the narrating first person of the world-weary, ageing Epicurean Omar himself, mixing sympotic exhortation and 'carpe diem' with splendid moralising and 'memento mori' nihilism.\"Comment by S. Harrison, editor and contributor to The Cambridge Companion to Horace (S. Harrison, The nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 337 Matthew Arnold advised a friend in verse not to worry about politics, an echo of Odes 2.11, yet later became a critic of Horace's inadequacies relative to Greek poets, as role models of Victorian virtues, observing: \"If human life were complete without faith, without enthusiasm, without energy, Horace...would be the perfect interpreter of human life.\"M. Arnold, Selected Prose, 74 Christina Rossetti composed a sonnet depicting a woman willing her own death steadily, drawing on Horace's depiction of 'Glycera' in Odes 1.19.5\u20136 and Cleopatra in Odes 1.37.Rossetti's sonnet, A Study (a soul), dated 1854, was not published in her own lifetime.

Housman considered Odes 4.7, in Archilochian couplets, the most beautiful poem of antiquityW. Flesch, Companion to British Poetry, 19th Century, 98 and yet he generally shared Horace's penchant for quatrains, being readily adapted to his own elegiac and melancholy strain.S. Harrison, The nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 339 The most famous poem of Ernest Dowson took its title and its heroine's name from a line of Odes 4.1, Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae, as well as its motif of nostalgia for a former flame. Kipling wrote a famous parody of the Odes, satirising their stylistic idiosyncrasies and especially the extraordinary syntax, but he also used Horace's Roman patriotism as a focus for British imperialism, as in the story Regulus in the school collection Stalky & Co., which he based on Odes 3.5.S. Medcalfe, Kipling's Horace, 217\u201339 Wilfred Owen's famous poem, quoted above, incorporated Horatian text to question patriotism while ignoring the rules of Latin scansion. However, there were few other echoes of Horace in the war period, possibly because war is not actually a major theme of Horace's work.S.

However, the twists and turns associated with the volta allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects. Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics (John Milton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Claude McKay), theology (John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins), war (Wilfred Owen, e.e. cummings), and gender and sexuality (Carol Ann Duffy).

Controversy surrounded its praise of the military and approval of violence, to the extent that it has frequently been described as fascist, and its implication that militarism is superior to traditional democracy. Heinlein's peers were among those who argued over the book; a comparison between a quote in Starship Troopers that \"the noblest fate that a man can endure is to place his own mortal body between his loved home and war's desolation\" and the anti-war poem \"Dulce et Decorum Est\" by Wilfred Owen began a two-year discussion in the Proceedings of the Institute for Twenty-First Century Studies from 1959 to 1961, with James Blish, Poul Anderson, Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer, Anthony Boucher, John Brunner, Brian Aldiss, among those debating Starship Trooperss quality of writing, philosophy, and morality."]}, {"page": "1918", "response": ["** Wilfred Owen, British poet, soldier (killed in action) (b. 1893)"]}, {"page": "1917", "response": ["* August 17 \u2013 One of English literature's important meetings takes place, when Wilfred Owen introduces himself to Siegfried Sassoon at the Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh."]}, {"page": "1893", "response": ["* March 18 \u2013 Wilfred Owen, English soldier, poet (d. 1918)"]}]}}
