He was one of the leading poets of the First World War. His war poetry on the horrors of trenches and gas warfare was much influenced by his mentor Siegfried Sassoon and stood in contrast to the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke. Among his best-known works \u2013 most of which were published posthumously \u2013 are \"Dulce et Decorum est\", \"Insensibility\", \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\", \"Futility\", \"Spring Offensive\" and \"Strange Meeting\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
