Her work in Ethiopia in 1984 inspired Band Aid and subsequently Live Aid, the biggest relief programme ever mounted. Bertschinger received the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1991 for her work in nursing, and was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010 for \"services to Nursing and to International Humanitarian Aid\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Live Aid", "response": ["The 1985 Live Aid concert was conceived as a follow-on to the successful charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" which was also the brainchild of Geldof and Ure. In October 1984, images of hundreds of thousands of people starving to death in Ethiopia were shown in the UK in Michael Buerk's BBC News reports on the 1984 famine.\"Live Aid: The show that rocked the world\". BBC. Retrieved 15 September 2011 The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk's report on 23 October describing it as \"a biblical famine in the 20th century\" and \"the closest thing to hell on Earth\". The reports featured a young nurse, Claire Bertschinger, who, surrounded by 85,000 starving people, told of her sorrow of having to decide which children would be allowed access to the limited food supplies in the feeding station and which were too sick to be saved. She would put a little mark on the children who got chosen, with Geldof stating of her at the time, \"In her was vested the power of life and death. She had become God-like and that is unbearable for anyone.\" Traumatised by what she experienced she didn\u2019t speak about it for two decades, recalling in 2005, \"I felt like a Nazi sending people to the death camps. Why was I in this situation? Why was it possible in this time of plenty that some have food and some do not? It is not right\".", "Many artists and performers at Live Aid gained prominence and positive commercial influence. For all the cultural, charitable, and technological significance of 1985's Live Aid, its most immediate impact was on the charts. In the UK, for example, No Jacket Required by Phil Collins and Madonna's Like a Virgin leapt back into the top ten. Queen's three-year old Greatest Hits rose fifty-five places into the top twenty, followed by Freddie Mercury's Mr. Bad Guy. Every U2 album available at the time also returned to the chart. In 1986, Geldof received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for his efforts. Claire Bertschinger, the nurse who featured in Buerk\u2019s news reports that sparked the aid relief movement, received the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1991 for her work in nursing, and was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010 for \"services to Nursing and to International Humanitarian Aid\"."]}, {"page": "Do They Know It's Christmas?", "response": ["The song was inspired by a series of reports that Michael Buerk made for BBC television news programmes in 1984, which highlighted the famine in Ethiopia that was taking place at the time.
