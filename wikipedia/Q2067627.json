Hobson's report was forwarded to the Colonial Office. From April to May 1838, the House of Lords held a select committee into the \"State of the Islands of New Zealand\".

Because of his ill health, he went to England in 1832 on sick leave, arriving there almost completely blind. In 1833 he published his Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia during the years 1828, 1829, 1830 and 1831, of which a second edition appeared in 1834. For the first time the public in England realised the importance of Sturt's work. Governor Darling's somewhat tardy but appreciative dispatch of 14 April 1831, and his request for Sturt's promotion, had had no result. Sir Richard Bourke, who had succeeded Darling, was also unsuccessful in persuading Viscount Goderich to give \"this deserving officer your Lordship's protection and support\". Though the colonial office did not seem to recognise the value of Sturt's work, publication of his book was important because it captured the attention of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who read it. He chose South Australia for a new settlement then being contemplated by the government. In May 1834, based on his services, Sturt applied for a grant of land in Australia, intending to settle on it."]}, {"page": "Thomas Mitchell (explorer)", "response": ["After the fruitless search for Cunningham, Mitchell decided to continue the expedition. He was assisted by a local unnamed elder who provided a guide called Tackijally. This man led Mitchell downstream along the waterholes adjacent to the Bogan River as far as Nyngan. Tackijally left them at this point and the group was soon involved in a brief confrontation after they startled an Aboriginal man at a waterhole. The man, who was shot in the hand, had his wounds dressed by the group and later departed. They proceeded down the Bogan, encountering several gatherings of people to which Mitchell gave tomahawks and pieces of an old sword. On 25 May the junction with the Darling River was reached. Here, on a high point of land which bore many Aboriginal grave sites, Mitchell decided to build a fort as he realised that they \"had not asked permission to come there\" and he needed a stockade for \"stout resistance against any number of natives.\" He named it Fort Bourke in honour of the Governor, Richard Bourke."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Melbourne history", "response": ["*1837 \u2013 10 April - Melbourne named by Governor General Richard BourkeNew South Wales Government Gazette, 12 April 1837 (No.271), p. 303."]}]}}
