The fight would mark Haskins' third defence since winning the title in 2015. Speaking on his first world title challenge, Burnett said, \"I always dreamed of headlining in Belfast and now I have the opportunity to do it for a World Title \u2013 I\u2019m so excited.\" Burnett defeated Haskins via a 12-round split decision to win his first world title and become Northern Ireland's first world bantamweight champion on 20 years. Burnett dropped Haskins twice in the fight in knocking him down once in round 6 and again in round 11. Both fighters were cut from a clash of heads in the round 2. The final judges\u2019 scores were 119-107, 119-107 for Burnett and 118-108 for Haskins. The result was later changed to a unanimous decision as judge Clark Sammartino who scored the fight for Haskins put the wrong name in the box. Haskins had the most success in the opening two rounds, however Burnett took control of the fight and dominated until the end. After the fight, promoter Eddie Hearn said, \"I believe a new star is born in Belfast. I believe Burnett won by a 12 round unanimous decision tonight. I\u2019m going to speak to Adam Smith tomorrow.\" Speaking of judge Sammartino, Robert Smith, the British Boxing Board of Control secretary stated, \"He will not be coming back to this country and I will be telling the IBF.\" WBO beltholder Zolani Tete called out Burnett for a unification bout, stating he was happy for it to take place in Belfast.", "In January 2018, IBF mandatory challenger Emmanuel 'Manny' Rodriguez (17-0, 12 KO) and his team tried and failed to reach a deal with former champion Lee Haskins, in a bout where the winner would have received the Interim IBF title, which forced IBF to order purse bids between Rodriguez and Burnett. The purse bid was set for 12 February. At the time the purse bids were ordered, Eddie Hearn was already in talks with Venezuelan boxer Yonfrez Parejo (21-2-1, 10 KOs), who is also the WBA mandatory, to hold a fight on the Joshua vs. Parker undercard on 31 March at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff. Hearn explained to Sky Sports, \"The IBF called an interim title bout between Emmanuel Rodriguez and Lee Haskins, so we proceeded to make the fight with our WBA mandatory, Parejo. Last week we were notified that the [Rodriguez-Haskins] bout would no longer take place and that Rodriguez\u2019s team [was] not willing to negotiate, and they called immediate purse bids. Our deal was already in place with Parejo, so we will vacate our IBF title and continue to face our WBA mandatory.\" On 12 February, Burnett vs. Parejo was confirmed. Burnett dominated Parejo over 12 rounds retaining his WBA title in the process. Burnett started the fight the better boxer before Parejo started to attack more from round 3. This made Burnett use technique and defence, making Parejo miss often. Burnett suffered a cut over his left eye from a clash of heads in round 7. This did not slow Burnett down and he continued to out-work Parejo. Parejo did not do enough to win the close rounds either. Burnett injured his right hand in round 3.
