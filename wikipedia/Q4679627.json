However, due to the club's current low league position, Kalala snubbed a permanent contract, but did however extend his loan stay with the North East Lincolnshire club until the end of the season.

A day later he received international clearance to play for Grimsby's reserve team in their league fixture away against Bradford City. He played the entire 90 minutes in a 2\u20131 win for Grimsby. Two days later, on 4 December 2008 he was offered and subsequently signed an 18-month contract keeping him at Blundell Park until the end of the 2009\u201310 season. The signing of Akpro at Grimsby would be the third French speaking player to join the club under in the Mike Newell tenure, with Congolese midfielder Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala and fellow Frenchman Mickael Buscher also arriving at Cleethorpes. He originally was set to make his debut against Port Vale on 6 December, but his papers from the Belgian Football Association were not received on time for him to feature. He instead made his debut against Shrewsbury Town on 13 December, and helped Grimsby to record their first home league victory of the season with a 1\u20130 victory. He went on to make it into the League Two Team of the Week after setting up Nathan Jarman's winner against Wycombe Wanderers on 17 January 2009. In the remaining months of the season, The Mariners were involved in a relegation battle, in which Akpa Akpro found himself playing a key part, mainly being fielded in attack alongside Adam Proudlock. In March 2009, Akpro and Proudlock destroyed local rivals Lincoln City in a 5\u20131 victory, with Akpa Akpro scoring two, and Proudlock hitting a hat-trick. Towards the very end of the campaign Barry Conlon became Akpro's regular strike partner, and the two would turn out to become vital to the club's eventual survival from relegation. During the 2009\u201310 season, a managerial change saw the man responsible for his arrival at Grimsby, Mike Newell sacked in October 2009. During the season in which many different players were used all over the pitch, Akpro's role in the first team would change from week to week, with some weeks new boss Neil Woods choosing to play him in his usual attacking role, whilst other weeks he operated in a wide left position or on the wing, and in other weeks merely only a substitute and in some circumstances also failing to make the 18 man squad at all. Akpro would play his part in ending an awful club record when he scored in a 3\u20130 victory over Shrewsbury Town on 6 March 2010, which was Grimsby's first league victory in 25 games. Following relegation from the Football League, Akpro rejected Grimsby's new contract offer and left the club on 26 June 2010.http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~2079073,00.html"]}, {"page": "2008 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["|FW ||31||Adam Proudlock"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Adam Proudlock", "| Adam Proudlock", "| Adam Proudlock"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 5 September 2003 || Adam Proudlock ||align=\"center\"| Sheffield Wednesday||align=\"center\"|\u00a3150,000"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 25 October 2002 ||  Adam Proudlock ||align=\"center\"| Tranmere Rovers ||align=\"center\"|  25 November 2002", "| 13 December 2002 ||  Adam Proudlock ||align=\"center\"| Sheffield Wednesday ||align=\"center\"| 7 January 2003"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Adam Proudlock", "| Adam Proudlock", "| Adam Proudlock"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 19 March 2002 ||  Adam Proudlock || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Nottingham Forest || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 16 April 2002"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|1 August 2000|| Adam Proudlock||align=\"center\"| Clyde||align=\"center\"|5 September 2000"]}, {"page": "Proudlock", "response": ["*Adam Proudlock, footballer"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|31||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Adam Proudlock"]}]}}
