Initial attempts to get it to fly were entirely unsuccessful.  This was largely due to its unsatisfactory wing section (the shallow camber of the Zodiac's wings had been commented upon by the aviation journal Flight), but the aircraft was also underpowered for its weight, and a new set of wings did little to improve performance.

This was authorized by Sir George, and Challenger set to work on drawings for a new aircraft.Penrose 1969, p. 235.
