She studied at the Glasgow School of Art between 1902 and 1911. She regularly went on painting trips with her father to both Europe, notably to the Netherlands and Belgium, and also within Scotland. On one such trip, to Pittenweem in Fife, Coventry met her future husband, the scholar Edward Robertson, whom she married in 1915. From 1916 to 1921 the couple lived at Inveresk in East Lothian and then, between 1921 and 1934, in Bangor in north Wales where Robertson was a professor of Semitic languages. When he took a post in Manchester they moved to Didsbury before moving in 1962 to Canada where Coventry died at Hudson, Quebec in 1964."]}]}}
