They are simply smaller test tubes inserted upside down in another test tube. This small tube is initially filled with the solution in which the microorganism is to be grown. If gas is produced after inoculation and incubation, a visible gas bubble will be trapped inside the small tube. The initial air gap produced when the tube is inserted upside down is lost during sterilization, usually performed at 121\u00a0\u00b0C for 15 or so minutes.  The method was first reported in 1898 by British microbiologist Herbert Durham.Durham 1898"]}, {"page": "Alfred Theodore MacConkey", "response": ["He initially went into private practice at Beckenham, Kent, but after illness decided to specialize in bacteriology, joining the Bacteriology department at Guy's Hospital in 1897.

Durham, Longmans, Green & Co, 1902 In 1881 the Cuban epidemiologist Dr Carlos Finlay was the first to theorise that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes, but this remained unproven in the wider scientific community. While en route to Brazil they visited the U.S. Naval Hospital in Washington where they met U. S. Surgeon General George Miller Sternberg who is considered the first U.S. bacteriologist, and then proceeded to Havana where they met Dr Finlay and his co-workers on 25 July 1900, and also the U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission, led by Dr Walter Reed, which subsequently confirmed Dr Finlay's theory.
