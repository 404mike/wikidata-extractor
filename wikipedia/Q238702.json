Wells, Aldiss was a vice-president of the international H. G. Wells Society. He was (with Harry Harrison) co-president of the Birmingham Science Fiction Group. Aldiss was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 2000 and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He received two Hugo Awards, one Nebula Award, and one John W. Campbell Memorial Award. He wrote the short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" (1969), the basis for the Stanley Kubrick-developed Steven Spielberg film A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).

This foundational work has garnered attention from some feminist critics, such as Dale Spender, who considered this a forerunner of the science fiction genre, more generally. Another early female writer of science fiction was Mary Shelley. Her novel Frankenstein (1818) dealt with the asexual creation of new life, and has been considered by some a reimagining of the Adam and Eve story.Brian Aldiss has argued that Frankenstein should be considered the first true science fiction story, because unlike in previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character \"makes a deliberate decision\" and \"turns to modern experiments in the laboratory\" to achieve fantastic results.

In the United States, Harlan Ellison's 1967 anthology Dangerous Visions is viewed as the best representation of the genre; J. G. Ballard and Brian Aldiss were also principal writers within the movement. The New Wave was a period marked by the emergence of a greater diversity of voices in science fiction, most notably the rise in the number of female writers, including Joanna Russ, Ursula K. Le Guin and Alice Bradley Sheldon (using the pseudonym James Tiptree, Jr.).", "The New Wave was in part a rejection of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Algis Budrys in 1965 wrote of the \"recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940s\u2014the implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface\". The New Wave did not define itself as a development from the science fiction which came before it, but initially reacted against it. New Wave writers did not operate as an organized group, but some of them felt the tropes of the pulp and Golden Age periods had become worn out, and should be abandoned: J. G. Ballard stated in 1962 that \"science fiction should turn its back on space, on interstellar travel, extra-terrestrial life forms, (and) galactic wars\", and Brian Aldiss said in Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction that \"the props of SF are few: rocket ships, telepathy, robots, time travel...like coins, they become debased by over-circulation.\" Harry Harrison summarised the period by saying \"old barriers were coming down, pulp taboos were being forgotten, new themes and new manners of writing were being explored\".", "The New Wave was not a formal organization with a fixed membership. Thomas M. Disch, for instance, rejected his association with some other New Wave authors.:425 Nonetheless, it is possible to associate specific authors and works, especially anthologies, with the movement. Michael Moorcock, J. G. Ballard, and Brian Aldiss are considered principal writers of the New Wave. Judith Merril's annual anthologies (1957\u20131968\"Best SF \u2013 reviews and contents of Merril anthologies\" Retrieved 2011-01-27) \"were the first heralds of the coming of the [New Wave] cult,\":105 and Damon Knight's Orbit series and Harlan Ellison's Dangerous Visions featured American writers inspired by British writers as well as British authors.

Dick, Sonya Dorman, Carol Emshwiller, John Sladek, Theodore Sturgeon, and Roger Zelazny.", "Brian Aldiss's Barefoot in the Head (1969) and Norman Spinrad's No Direction Home (1971) are seen as illustrative of the impact of the drug culture, especially psychedelics, on New Wave. On the topic of entropy, Ballard provided \"an explicitly cosmological vision of entropic decline of the universe\" in The Voices of Time, which provided a typology of ideas that subsequent New Wave writers developed in different contexts, with one of the best instances being Pamela Zoline's The Heat Death of the Universe. Like other writers for New Worlds, Zoline uses \"science-fictional and scientific language and imagery to describe perfectly 'ordinary' scenes of life\", and by doing so produces \"altered perceptions of reality in the reader\". New wave works engaging with utopia, gender, and sexuality include Ursula K. Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), Joanna Russ's The Female Man (1975), and Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976).:82-85 In Robert Silverberg's The Man in the Maze, in a reversal typical of the New Wave, Silverberg portrays a disabled man using an alien labyrinthine city to reject abled society.
