He currently works as a commentator.\nNicknamed \"Magic Chris\", football journalist Luke Ginnell wrote that Waddle was \"widely acknowledged as one of the finest attacking midfielders in Europe\". During his professional career, which lasted from 1978 to 1998, he played for several clubs, including Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Olympique de Marseille and Sheffield Wednesday. In 1989, his transfer from Tottenham to Marseille for \u00a34.5 million made him the third most valuable player in the world, and he won three successive Ligue 1 titles with the club and played in the 1991 European Cup Final. While playing for Wednesday he was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances in the 1992-93 season. He also played in the Premier League for Sunderland, in the Scottish Premiership with Falkirk and in the Football League for Bradford City, Burnley and Torquay United. He finished his career in non-league football with Worksop Town, Glapwell and Stocksbridge Park Steels, later whilst in his fifties, he continued to play at semi-professional level for Northern Counties East League side Hallam. \nWaddle earned 62 caps for England between 1985 and 1991, which included being a member of the teams which reached the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup and the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup. He also played for England at UEFA Euro 1988.\nHe had a spell as Burnley managed during the 1997\u201398 season, but has not returned to coaching since. Largely since retiring he has worked in the media for BBC Radio Five Live as part of their Premier League and Champions League team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 14", "response": ["*  1960   \u2013 Chris Waddle, English footballer, manager, and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "Pizza Hut", "response": ["Following England's defeat to Germany on penalties in the semifinals of Euro '96, Gareth Southgate, Stuart Pearce, and Chris Waddle featured in an advertisement, which shows Southgate wearing a paper bag over his head in shame as he was the one who missed the crucial penalty against Germany.

Dinnis was replaced by Bill McGarry, and then he was replaced by Arthur Cox. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the 1983\u201384 season, with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle and ex-England captain Kevin Keegan the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired. With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold, and the team was relegated once more in 1989. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by Jim Smith. Smith left at the start of the 1991\u201392 season and the board appointed Osvaldo Ardiles his replacement."]}, {"page": "Ruud Gullit", "response": ["In 1990\u201391, Milan's pursuit of a third consecutive European Cup was cut short by Marseille at the quarter-final stage.

This prevented the Owls from making another appearance in European competition. Still, the 1992\u201393 season established Sheffield Wednesday as a top club. Midfielder Chris Waddle was voted Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, and the strike partnership of David Hirst and Mark Bright was one of the most feared in the country.

Arthur Cox had left the club after leading the \"Magpies\" to the First Division and key player Kevin Keegan announced his retirement. His first action was to release Terry McDermott from his contract, who refused to agree to Charlton's offer of a new contract. He had little money to spend in preparation for the 1984\u201385 season, though he did have young talents in Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley. He signed midfielder Gary Megson and big striker George Reilly. The \"Toon\" finished safely in 14th place, and a teenage Paul Gascoigne was on the verge of breaking into the first team.", "The build up to Euro 1988 in West Germany was far from ideal, as key player Mark Lawrenson was forced to retire after injuring his Achilles tendon, Liam Brady picked up a serious knee injury and Mark Kelly was also injured. The first match of the tournament was against England at the Neckarstadion, and Charlton reasoned that the threat posed by English wingers Chris Waddle and John Barnes could be nullified by allowing the English defence to feel comfortable on the ball without allowing them a pass; this made the build-up play slow and containable. His game-plan worked and Ireland claimed a 1\u20130 win after Ray Houghton secured an early lead. He then compensated for a series of injuries by playing Ronnie Whelan and Kevin Sheedy in central midfield, and was rewarded with a great performance and a good point in a 1\u20131 draw with the Soviet Union at the Niedersachsenstadion, Whelan scoring the goal. To qualify they only needed a point against the Netherlands at the Parkstadion, and Charlton devised a time-wasting plan with goalkeeper Packie Bonner that he was forced to abandon after referee Horst Brummeier was less than impressed. Ireland lost the game 1\u20130 after Wim Kieft scored an 82nd-minute goal. England and Ireland were eliminated while Netherlands and the Soviet Union qualified \u2013 both teams would go on to contest the final, which the Dutch won 2\u20130."]}, {"page": "Gateshead", "response": ["*Chris Waddle \u2013 footballer (Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur and Sheffield Wednesday)"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Chris Waddle \u2013 BBC Sport 1994\u20131998 & 2014, BBC Radio 5 Live 1998\u2013present, Setanta Sports 2007\u20132009, ESPN UK 2009\u20132013"]}, {"page": "Dore, South Yorkshire", "response": ["Notable residents include Gary Megson, a former footballer and  manager of Sheffield Wednesday F.C., Dave Bassett, former footballer and former manager of Southampton F.C., Watford F.C., Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest F.C., and Chris Waddle,A Charmed life in Dore and Totley, South Yorkshire Yorkshire Life. 23 March 2011.
