It is also a remarkable monument in the history of Indian taste in Britain: an Indian billiard room wing, which inspired the more famous Durbar Room at Osborne House, was prefabricated in India and installed in the 1880s.

The Indian craftsmen who assembled and installed the room at Bagshot were housed in a tent in the grounds.
