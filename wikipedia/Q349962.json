He joined Aston Villa in 2008, but was limited to fewer than 40 appearances over two seasons. While with Villa, Shorey was loaned out to Nottingham Forest and Fulham. He joined West Bromwich Albion for \u00a31.3 million in July 2010, making 53 Premier League appearances over two seasons with the club. After four years away from the club, Shorey rejoined Reading in July 2012, but could only manage 21 appearances when he joined Bristol City the following season. He spent just five months with City before joining Portsmouth in January 2014, and then Indian Super League club Pune City in the summer of 2015 for the forthcoming season. After playing in every match for Pune City, Shorey returned to England in January 2016 with League One club Colchester United. He finished his playing career with National League South club Hungerford Town.\nShorey has represented England at full international level on two occasions, with both appearances made at Wembley Stadium in 2007 against Brazil and Germany. He also made one appearance for the England B team.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reading F.C.", "response": ["| Academy Lead Scout ||  Nicky Shorey"]}, {"page": "Nicky", "response": ["* Nicky Shorey (born 1981), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Wingate & Finchley F.C.", "response": ["The club finished mid-table in its first season in the Premier Division, before surviving a relegation scare in 2012\u201313 with one match to spare.

He had fought the disease before, when he had a form of skin cancer removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street."]}]}}
