He has taught Islam at the Universities of Leicester, Bristol and Cambridge, and had spent a period of time in India where he was ordained into the Church of South India. He was also a senior tutor and lecturer in Pastoral and Systematic Theology (Wesley House, Cambridge), and was a member of the Cambridge University Faculty of Divinity. Currently, he is the Executive Director of Aurora University's Wackerlin Center for Faith and Action and the Helena Wackerlin Professor of Religion, and has participated in numerous Interfaith dialogues. He has authored a number of books related to Islam and Christianity, such as \"Muhammad: A Short Biography\" and \"Jesus: A Short Biography\" respectively.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. Montgomery Watt", "response": ["Martin Forward, a 21st-century non-Muslim Islamic scholar, states:"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Cracknell", "response": ["Cracknell has written many articles and books on interfaith dialogue and other subjects, including Towards a New Relationship (1985), Justice Courtesy and Love (1994), An Introduction to World Methodism (2005), and In Good and Generous Faith (2005). A festschrift, A Great Commission (2000) edited by Martin Forward, Stephen Plant and Susan White, includes scholarly articles by numerous friends and colleagues on the occasion of Cracknell's 65th birthday.  He has pioneered a sensitive and respectful Christian approach to the religious Other while dealing skillfully with Bible verses that for some demand a total condemnation of other religions and the conversion of their followers.  Wesley S. Ariarajah, former director of inter-religions relations at the World Council of Churches describes Cracknell's discussion as \"a probing exegesis of the apparently exclusive verses.\"  Ariarajah, Wesley S Hindus and Christians: A Century of Protestant Ecumenical Thought, Grand Rapids: William B Eeerdmans, 199I  p 215", "The fact that the interfaith committee at the British Council of Churches was at the time located within the Mission Division and was mainly funded by Missionary Societies made reflection on mission an almost inevitable aspect of the director's role. Cracknell's sustained interest in Christian mission is indicated by the title chosen for the 2000 volume, A Great Commission, edited by Martin Forward, in honor of his scholarly contribution. Cracknell's 1985 book, Towards A New Relationship written while serving at the BCC explored many of the Biblical passages, such as John 14: 6 and Acts 4: 2 that Christian cite to defend an exclusive view of salvation as found only through an explicit, with the lips confession of Jesus as Lord and Savior.  Cracknell argued that salvation is to be found \"in the Name\" but that \"His Name is the Name because it affords the means by which human beings share in the grace and love that is the nature of God himself\" Cracknell, Kenneth (1985) p 29. His linguistic skill with the Biblical languages often disarmed critics, who saw his approach as a betrayal of Christian truth but who relied on English translations of the two testaments.  Ariarajah says that \"without denying any of the positive aspects of mission\", Cracknell challenges Christians to re-think their attitudes to Others free from \"prejudices stemming from the assumption of cultural superiority.\"Ariarajah, op cit p 191 citing Cracknell (1995) p 93 where Cracknell refers to the relationship between colonial attitudes of superiority and the \"legacies of earlier missionary theologies\" as \"one single sad tangle\". Hugh Goddard refers to a \"detailed study\" of the Protestant World Missionary Conference of 1910 in Cracknell (1994) in which he \"concluded that in some ways nineteenth century Christian thinking, including  that of some missionaries, was readier than subsequent Christian thought to contemplate continuity rather than discontinuity between Christianity and other religions\".  \"In that sense\", says Goddard, Cracknell suggests that \"under the influence of Barth and Kraemer the twentieth century has gone backwards rather than forwards.\"Goddard, Hugh (2000) A History of Christian-Muslim Relations, Chicago, IL: New Amsterdam Books  p 151  Cracknell was awarded his Oxford BD for this book.", "After 10 years at the BCC, Cracknell moved to Wesley House, Cambridge where he held the Michael Gutteridge Chair in Theology and was Senior Tutor, continuing at the same time to work closely with the interfaith desk of the World Council of Churches and other interfaith groups.  During his tenure in Cambridge, Cracknell also served as President of the Theological Federation (1988 to 1995). In much of his writing, Cracknell drew on the scholarship of Wilfred Cantwell Smith whose approach allows Others to define themselves, resisting the temptation to impose preconceived assumptions such as that any claim to experience God outside of Christ must be false.  He was succeeded at Wesley by Martin Forward who had directed interfaith relations for the British Methodist Church and who was also involved in the work of the BCC committee."]}, {"page": "Diplomatic career of Muhammad", "response": ["There are instances according to Islamic tradition where Muhammad is thought to have sent letters to other heads of state during the Medinan phase of his life. Amongst others, these included the Negus of Axum, the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (), the Muqawqis of Egypt and the Sasanid emperor Khosrau II (). There has been controversy amongst academic scholars as to their authenticity.El-Cheikh (1999) pp. 5\u201421 According to Martin Forward, academics have treated some reports with skepticism, although he argues that it is likely that Muhammad had assumed correspondence with leaders within the Arabian Peninsula. Robert Bertram Serjeant opines that the letters are forgeries and were designed to promote both the 'notion that Muhammad conceived of Islam as a universal religion and to strengthen the Islamic position against Christian polemic.' He further argues the unlikelihood of Muhammad sending such letters when he had not yet mastered Arabia.Footnote of the El-Cheikh(1999) reads: \"Opposed to its authenticity is R. B. Sejeant \"Early Arabic Prose: in Arabic Literature to the End of the Umayyad Period, ed. A. E L. Beeston et a1 ... (Cambridge, 1983), pp. 141\u20132.

Loc cit. Irfan Shahid, professor of the Arabic language and Islamic literature at Georgetown University, contends that dismissing the letters sent by Muhammad as forgeries is \"unjustified\", pointing to recent research establishing the historicity of the letter to Heraclius as an example."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Academics of the University of Cambridge", "response": ["Martin Forwardnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Wesley House", "response": ["*Martin Forward"]}, {"page": "Centre for Jewish\u2013Christian Relations", "response": ["Founded by Edward Kessler and Martin Forward in 1998, CJCR teaches the University of Cambridge's Master of Studies in the study of Jewish\u2013Christian relations programme and offers a variety of other educational programmes.
