At the time of his election he was the only independent PCC not to have a background in policing. After a four-decade long career in aviation as an airline pilot on both commercial and cargo flights he was elected to the newly created office of Police and Crime Commissioner on 15 November 2012. One of his first acts in the post was to endorse an alliance with a neighbouring police force aimed at pooling resources and reducing overall costs. Although his role was a non-operational one, he requested a review of a police investigation into a motoring accident that left several people injured, citing public concerns over the incident. After it emerged that police officers who held a meeting with former Conservative Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell following his involvement in the Plebgate affair had not given a proper account of their conversation, Ball became caught up in the affair after criticising the findings of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) which recommended the officers be disciplined. Ball did not contest the 2016 election for the post, and was succeeded by Philip Seccombe of the Conservative Party.", "In October 2015 Ball announced that he would not be standing for re-election in 2016. The second police and crime commissioner elections, held on 5 May 2016, saw Conservative Party councillor Philip Seccombe elected to succeed Ball with 43,208 votes, and on a turnout of 26.73%. Ball offered Seccombe his congratulations: \"I have no doubt that he will find the job as rewarding and enjoyable as I have and I wish him the very best for the next four years.\""]}, {"page": "Seccombe", "response": ["* Philip Seccombe, British politician"]}, {"page": "2016 United Kingdom local elections", "response": ["|Philip Seccombe (Conservative)"]}, {"page": "2016 England and Wales police and crime commissioner elections", "response": ["*Philip Seccombe (Conservative)"]}]}}
