After gaining his Diploma of Fine Art (Painting), in 1962 Baldessin moved to London, where he studied printmaking at the Chelsea School of Art; in September of the same year he visited Spain. In this period, and most notably during his English stay, Baldessin discovered many artists that would profoundly influence his later production, including Francis Bacon, David Hockney, Peter Blake, Ingmar Bergman, and Luis Bu\u00f1uel. In 1963 he attended the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan, under professor Marino Marini and his assistant, Alik Cavaliere.
