His interactive audio-visual album Equasian, featuring an experimentation with \"VISIC\" (visual music), melded his scientific background into a musical framework, and his Oracles of Distraction, a set of poetic cards set to musical coordinates, further expanded his lyrical idiom.He has written lyrics for Sarah Brightman and Boy George; co-written lyrics with Michael Jackson, had his work covered by Eric Clapton, worked with the West African kora player Toumani Diabat\u00e9 and the calligraphy artist Juichi Yoshikawa; and wrote the verse dance drama Amaterasu, the Resurrection of Radiance, that was performed with the City Ballet of London at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (2001).As \"Mozz\", Mosdell has also released a series of award-winning children's books, which he also illustrates.A film about his life entitled \"Ink Music: In the Land of the Hundred-Tongued Lyricist\", featuring interviews with many of his collaborators and shot in Japan and the United States, was released in 2009. The documentary bills him as the \"Lafcadio Hearn of Lyrics\", Long term collaborator Ryuichi Sakamoto describes his interpretation of how Mosdell creates his varied works; \"When I read his lyrics, I see him in a high school chemistry laboratory, making Molotov cocktails \u2013 his eyes lucid, blue and very clear.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yellow Magic Orchestra", "response": ["Their second album Solid State Survivor, released in 1979, was YMO's pinnacle recording in Japan, winning the 1980 Best Album Award in the Japan Record Awards. It featured English lyrics by Chris Mosdell, whose sci-fi themes often depicted a human condition alienated by dystopic futures, much like the emerging cyberpunk movement in fiction at that time. One of the album's major singles, and one of the band's biggest international hits, was \"Behind the Mask\", which YMO had first produced in 1978 for a Seiko quartz wristwatch commercial, and then for Solid State Survivor with lyrics penned by Chris Mosdell. The song was later revised by Michael Jackson, who added new lyrics and had intended to include it in his album Thriller. Despite the approval of songwriter Sakamoto and lyricist Chris Mosdell, it was eventually removed from the album due to legal issues with YMO's management. Jackson's version was never released until his first posthumous album, Michael, though his additional lyrics were included in later cover versions of the song by Greg Phillinganes, Eric Clapton, and Ryuichi Sakamoto himself in his 1986 solo release Media Bahn Live.
