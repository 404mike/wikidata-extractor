In 1818\u20131819, for example, the ship carried 160 male convicts to Sydney from Portsmouth sailing on 20 November and arriving 18 June. Also on board as passengers were the first Minister of St James' Church, Sydney, Richard Hill and his wife."]}, {"page": "St James' Church, Sydney", "response": ["There was both official and general concern about the lack of morality within the predominantly male population, and the establishment of churches and of education was seen as a method of combatting this. The 19th-century church historian, Edward Symonds, credited a \"better moral and spiritual tone\" in the colony to \"decent churches\" and \"the advent of additional clergy, headed by William Cowper, in 1808\". The first rector of St James', Richard Hill, was ordained specifically for colonial ministry and sent from London as assistant to William Cowper at St Philip's. Hill was energetic and a good organiser, with progressive views on education. He instigated a number of projects to aid the community, including an infants' school in the crypt of the church and a Sunday School.", "In 1836, Richard Hill had a fit of apoplexy in the vestry and died. Soon after this dramatic event, and while the church was still in mourning, William Grant Broughton was installed as Bishop of Australia during a service in St James' lasting five hours. Since Macquarie's plans for a new cathedral on George Street had not come to fruition, Broughton acted as if St James' were a pro-cathedral. Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon Woodd succeeded Richard Hill at St James'.", "Beneath the church is a large undercroft, built of brick and groin vaulted. It has been used for many purposes: as a residence by the widow of Richard Hill and later by a verger; by Canon Allwood as a part-time bedroom; for the parish's schools; and as a shelter by Australian, American and British armed forces during the two world wars. Rector Francis Wentworth-Sheilds gave the city parish \"a big role as a drop-in centre for servicemen\" during the First World War. During the Second World War bed and bedding were provided to over 30,000 Allied servicemen.", "In the 19th century, religious denominations made a major contribution to education at all levels before this was taken over by the state. From its beginnings, St James' was involved in education for both children and adults. Richard Hill, the first incumbent, \"began Australia's first kindergarten and William Cape managed a school based on new educational principles\". Hill worked with the Benevolent Society, the Bible Society, Aboriginals, the Hospital, \"various convict establishments and a range of schools,\" including Industrial Schools. By 1823 Greenway's school building had been erected in Elizabeth Street and the principal St James' School was situated there until 1882, becoming the Anglican \"normal\" school with more than 600 students and a range of experienced teachers. In secondary education, a Sydney branch of the King's School operated briefly in the Greenway building and Broughton operated the St James' Grammar School in a building erected in Phillip Street. The Grammar School, presided over by C. Kemp was described as \"of inestimable value to the then youth of the colony\". Broughton also set up St James' College to provide tertiary education for secular students as well as to prepare students for ordination. The St James' School closed in 1882 and the government resumed the Greenway building. Tuition for the students of St Paul's College, University of Sydney was originally provided in the vestry of St James'.", "* 1824\u20131836 Richard Hill", "* 5\u00a0\u2013 Richard Hill sounds the note C, named for the first rector of St James'"]}, {"page": "William Carr Smith", "response": ["* Richard Hill (priest)"]}, {"page": "James Laidley (administrator)", "response": ["Laidley died on Sunday 30 August 1835 at his residence in Darlinghurst, Sydney after a short illness.
