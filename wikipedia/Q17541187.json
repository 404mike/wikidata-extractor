The following season, on 6 January 2011, with Cambridge in a similar position to where they finished the previous season, the club's owners put the club up for sale citing the need for new funds to take the club forward. Despite interest being expressed from a number of parties, no new owner has yet been found. Later the same month, the club's landlords Grosvenor Group revealed the plans for a new community stadium, including potential new locations both within the city and outside it. At the start of 2011 Martin Ling was removed from his position as manager and replaced on a temporary basis by CRC manager Jez George. He managed to steer the club towards safety, finishing 17th, which led to George's role being made permanent. After having rebuilt the squad with players from the club's youth system and with astute signings in Harrison Dunk and Tom Shaw, George managed to lead Cambridge to a 9th-place finish, a huge improvement on their previous season. As well as the league, Jez George also took Cambridge to the quarter-final of the FA Trophy (which was the furthest they had reached at the time), but lost 2\u20131 at home to minnows, Wealdstone. Eleven games into the following season Jez George became Director of Football, and Richard Money was announced as the new head coach of the club. The club spent much of the season in mid-table, finishing in 14th position with 59 points. The squad was greatly revamped, and United started 2013\u201314 with a record-breaking 16 games unbeaten. Cambridge finished the season in second place, qualifying for the play-offs. After beating FC Halifax Town 2\u20131, on aggregate, in the semi-final, they won 2\u20131 against Gateshead in the final, held at Wembley Stadium, gaining promotion back to the Football League after a nine-year absence. The club also reached their first FA Trophy final, held at Wembley Stadium, where they beat Gosport Borough 4\u20130."]}, {"page": "Dunk", "response": ["* Harrison Dunk (born 1990), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2014 Conference Premier play-off Final", "response": ["|MF || 11 || Harrison Dunk || || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Cambridge United F.C. season", "response": ["|11||Harrison Dunk||LW||||London||||101||12||Bromley||7 June 2011||Free||2016", "| 11 ||  || Harrison Dunk || MF || 41+4 || 2 || 0+1 || || 43+5", "| 11 ||  || Harrison Dunk || MF || 4 || ||  ||  || 4", "| 11 ||  || Harrison Dunk || MF || 1 || 1 ||  ||  || 2", "| 11 ||  || Harrison Dunk || MF || 1 ||  ||  ||  || 1"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Cambridge United F.C. season", "response": ["|11||Harrison Dunk||LW||||London||||162||17||Bromley||7 June 2011||Free||30 June 2018"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Cambridge United F.C. season", "response": ["|11||Harrison Dunk||LW||||London||25 October 1990||26||200||19||Bromley||7 June 2011||Free||30 June 2018"]}]}}
