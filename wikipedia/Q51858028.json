After forcing Ali to save Nicola's life, Phelan requests for a hostage and selects Michelle - despite Robert's pleas to be taken instead to no avail. When Phelan clocks his gun and threatens to kill Michelle and Robert, Michelle quickly complies to spare Robert and she is taken hostage by Phelan. He drags her into the kitchen, where he finds himself confronted by Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) - whom Phelan had blackmailed into sleeping with four years earlier before going on to frame her for pushing Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) off a ladder a year earlier, which resulted in Anna's four month imprisonment until she was released at the time Phelan's crimes were exposed on the week Michelle proposed to Robert. As Anna and Phelan exchanged glances at each other, Michelle used this opportunity to try and escape from Phelan's clutches - prompting him to shove her aside and shoot Michelle.

Shortly afterward, Robert bursts into the kitchen with Ali and Carla. They proceed to tend to Michelle's aid, ignoring Phelan as he pulls the knife out of his chest and vows to have Anna imprisoned for his eventual demise. Michelle retaliates by promising to describe the stabbing as self-defence. Although Phelan blurts out to Michelle that in doing so would risk her facing the possibility of prison, Michelle states that she would task the risk for Anna's sake and for that of Phelan's two murdered victims: Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) - whom Phelan had locked in his old house's cellar a year earlier since he left his \u201cfather\u201d Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis) to die of a heart attack, before killing him after forcing him to execute his friend Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey) - and Luke Britton (Dean Fagan), the brother of Andy's girlfriend Steph Britton (Tisha Merry).
