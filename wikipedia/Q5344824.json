Among other things, he insisted on the necessity of purchasing a collection of pictures by the best masters as models for the students, and proposed several of those in the Orleans collection. This recommendation was not relished, and in 1799 Barry was expelled from the Academy soon after the appearance of his Letter to the Dilettanti Society, an eccentric publication, full of enthusiasm for his art and at the same time of contempt for the living professors of it. Barry remained the only academician ever to be expelled by the Academy until Brendan Neiland in July 2004."]}, {"page": "Royal Academy of Arts", "response": ["The instrument of foundation, signed by George III on 10 December 1768, named 34 founder members and allowed for a total membership of 40.

He trusted George Grenville who promptly appointed him Master-General of the Ordnance under his ministry on 14 May 1763.

He enrolled in the Royal Academy schools in 1778 where he studied under Edward Penny  (1714\u20131791) whose forte was depicting acts of charity. Bigg's greatest delight was in painting children. His first work in this genre to be exhibited in 1778 was Schoolboys giving Charity to a Blind Man. A year later he painted a similar work, A Lady and her Children relieving a Distressed Cottager. Apart from these his Palemon and Lavinia, the Shipwrecked Sailor Boy, and Youths relieving a Blind Man were very well received, and all were engraved. His subject choice and execution place him with Wheatley and George Morland. Bigg produced many small portraits in oil and pastel, as well as rustic genre paintings. His genre paintings and portraits have great charm and were highly popular in his day, the best engravers being used to render his work.Donald Heald"]}, {"page": "Richard Houston", "response": ["* John Manners, Marquess of Granby, on horseback, after Edward Penny; and full-lengths of ", "* 'The Death of General Wolfe,' after Edward Penny; "]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| Edward Penny   ||align=\"center\" |  1768  ||  Foundation member; first Professor of Painting 1768\u201382"]}, {"page": "Listed buildings in Congleton", "response": ["|The church replaced an earlier church on the site, and its tower was completed in 1786.
