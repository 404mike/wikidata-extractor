To fill the void, Robert Hampson of Loop was brought in to play on half of the new album's tracks as well as on Cold World (1991), an EP recorded in the same sessions. The sophomore album, Pure, was released in 1992 through Earache and has since been recognised as an influential release in the post-metal genre. Musically, Pure was even more mechanical than Streetcleaner, further emphasising the drum machine and featuring production that augmented the percussion with a stark, bleak atmosphere. Though Godflesh's most overt experiments with hip hop and breakbeats occurred later in their career, Pure featured elements of both buried under the wailing guitar, shouted vocals and aggressively repetitive drumming. The album continued its experimentation with atypical song structures on its conclusion, \"Pure II\", a twenty-minute ambient drone piece with a submerged beat that, as AllMusic's Ned Raggett said, \"hits like a distant cannon\".", "* Robert Hampson \u2013 guitars (1991\u20131992)"]}, {"page": "Loop (band)", "response": ["Loop are an English rock band, formed in 1986 by Robert Hampson in Croydon.
