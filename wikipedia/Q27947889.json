He bowled leg-spin at medium-pace. His Essex teammate Charles Bray said he was \"an excellent bowler \u2013 the nearest thing I've seen to Bill O'Reilly\", but added that Palmer's fielding was unreliable, \"particularly his catching\". Palmer's best bowling figures came in Essex's victory over Gloucestershire in 1926, when he took 3 for 19 and 6 for 68. Opening the bowling for Essex against the Australians in 1930, he took 5 for 40 in the first innings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Palmer", "response": ["Harold Palmer may refer to:", "* Harold Palmer (cricketer) (1890\u20131967), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Harold Palmer (1931)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Harold Palmer (1936) : H.
