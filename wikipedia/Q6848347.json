He co-wrote Tzuke's single \"Stay with Me till Dawn\" and her first album Welcome to the Cruise, then went on to write and produce a further twelve albums with her. Paxman continued working in the studio with Tzuke through to the late 1990s.\nFrom the mid-1980s, Paxman mainly focused on production work, founding Big Ocean Studios with Paul Muggleton, Tzuke's partner. They went on to work with various artists, including Nick Kamen (including the hit single \"I Promised Myself\"), Paul Norton (Under a Southern Sky), Scarlet (the album Naked and single \"Independent Love Song\"), Thomas Anders (the album Whispers), Frances Ruffelle and Jimmy Nail.\nPaxman has also worked with Status Quo extensively, producing several albums and DVDs including Under The Influence (1999), Heavy Traffic (2002), The Party Ain't Over Yet...

XXX was the final Asia album in their history after the departure of Steve Howe and later 2017 death of founder and singer, John Wetton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Asia (band)", "response": ["In late 2009, the band began working on their follow-up CD to Phoenix. According to Wetton's website in late November 2009: \"Good news is that the new album is starting to leap, rather than creep (or sleep) in terms of progress. This week I have two completed lead vocals, with complete harmony/chorus voxes on three. It's just me, Geoff [Downes], Steve R[ispin], and Mike Paxman in the studio--- Carl [Palmer] is pretty much all done, Steve H[owe] is half done, and returns to the fold after Yes tour. It sounds absolutely wonderful\". The follow-up, titled Omega, was released in the UK on 26 April 2010."]}, {"page": "Judie Tzuke", "response": ["Educated in the visual arts, performing arts, and music, Tzuke performed in folk clubs from the age of 15. Her meeting with Mike Paxman in 1975 was a turning point and they began to collaborate. Under the name Tzuke & Paxo, they eventually secured a recording contract and the duo released a single, \"These are the Laws\", produced by Tony Visconti.", "Tzuke's career as a solo artist began in 1977, when she signed to Elton John's label The Rocket Record Company. Her first single on Rocket, \"For You\", was released in 1978. Her only notable success, \"Stay with Me Till Dawn\", was released in 1979. The song, which was co-written with Mike Paxman, became a Top 20 hit in the UK Singles Chart in the summer of 1979 and a Top 10 hit in Australia and was featured on Tzuke's 1979 debut album, Welcome to the Cruise, which was also a Top 20 hit in the UK Albums Chart. In 2002, \"Stay With Me Till Dawn\" was chosen by the British public in a poll of the 50 Best British Songs 1952\u20132002 (ranking at number 39). The song was also sampled by Mylo in the song \"Need You Tonite\", which is on his 2004 album Destroy Rock & Roll.", "Following the muted reception of The Cat Is Out, Tzuke signed with another major label, Polydor Records, in 1987. She began working on her seventh album, though took some time off in June 1987 when she gave birth to her first daughter, Bailey. However, the release of the album was delayed further after Polydor first requested that Tzuke work with a producer of their choice rather than with her usual team. Polydor later agreed to allow Tzuke to re-record the entire album with her own team of Paul Muggleton (her husband) and Mike Paxman. The album, Turning Stones, was released in April 1989, peaking at No. 57 in the UK Albums Chart. It was preceded by the single \"We'll Go Dreaming\", which had peaked at no. 96 several weeks earlier. Further problems arose between Tzuke and Polydor which led to the last minute cancellation of her 1989 tour, enraging fans who had turned up to venues. She apologised to fans, and when she appeared as a guest on Radio 1's Friday evening record review show Round Table.", "In 1990, she switched to Columbia Records (CBS). In August, she released a new single, a cover version of the Beach Boys classic \"God Only Knows\". Despite the single being issued in various formats (7\", 7\" poster wrap, limited edition numbered 10\", 12\", cassette-single and CD-single) and a video being made, the song failed to gain chart success. A limited promo 12\" was issued of a remix made by DJ Judge Jules. The song also featured in an ITV documentary series about recording techniques, where Tzuke and her producers Mike Paxman and Paul Muggleton showed how the song had been constructed using samples of her voice which were transposed into a synthesizer range. Her eighth album, Left Hand Talking, was released by Columbia in May 1991."]}, {"page": "Famous in the Last Century", "response": ["Category:Albums produced by Mike Paxman"]}, {"page": "Paxman", "response": ["* Mike Paxman (born 1953), multi-instrumentalist and record producer"]}, {"page": "Andy Bown", "response": ["His latest solo album Unfinished Business was released on 5 September 2011.
