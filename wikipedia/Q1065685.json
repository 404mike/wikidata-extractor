After brief stints at several British universities, he was appointed to the prestigious Kennedy chair of Latin at Cambridge in 1954. In this role, he established himself as one of the foremost scholars of a generation of Jewish scholars who fled Germany during the Third Reich. Credited with bringing his intimacy with the conception of Alterumswissenschaften to Britain, Brink's principal academic achievement was a far ranging edition of Horace's theoretical work (three volumes of Horace on Poetry). He was a fellow of Gonville and Caius College.", "link_mentions": []}}
