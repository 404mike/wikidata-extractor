Harborough was a Liberal seat where the elderly sitting member had decided to retire at the next election. However, the outbreak of war postponed the general election. In 1915, Harris was elected Deputy Chairman of the London County Council. In the meantime, the health of the Liberal MP for Harborough deteriorated and he resigned from parliament causing the 1916 Harborough by-election. Harris was re-adopted by the local Liberals and his candidacy was also officially endorsed by both the Unionist and Labour parties, due to the wartime electoral truce. However, Harris faced a strong opponent in the by-election who received much Unionist support as well as strong support from prominent newspaper barons.Percy Harris (1947) Forty Years In and Out of Parliament; Andrew Melrose Despite this, Harris was elected to Parliament. In May 1918, when H. H. Asquith challenged Prime Minister David Lloyd George in the Maurice Debate, Harris sided with Asquith and went into the division lobby against the Coalition Government. As a result, he lost his seat at the 1918 general election when his Unionist opponent was endorsed by the Coalition Government. In 1919, Harris was engaged in correspondence with John Wycliffe Black, Chairman of the Harborough Divisional Liberal Association, about the amount of money Harris was expected to contribute if he wished to remain as Parliamentary candidate. In the end Harris was not able to meet the requirements of the divisional Liberal association and sought another constituency. Black was then adopted by Harborough Liberals as their candidate.Chris Cook (1975) The Age of Alignment: Electoral politics in Britain, 1922\u20131929, Macmillan. pp. 40-41"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who only sat in the 33rd Parliament", "response": ["*John Wycliffe Black (Liberal, Harborough)"]}, {"page": "Wycliffe (name)", "response": ["* John Wycliffe Black (1862\u20131951), an English shoe manufacturer and politician"]}]}}
