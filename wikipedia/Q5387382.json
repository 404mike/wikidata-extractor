He was twice the musical director of the Eurovision Song Contest when staged in London in 1960 and 1963 and on other occasions between 1957 and 1965, Robinson conducted the orchestra accompanying the United Kingdom's entry in the competition.In 1962, he provided the financial support and backing for the Mellotron tape-replay keyboard, and was heavily involved in the original marketing and promotion. He hoped the popularity of a new and novel instrument would revitalise his career.Robinson's elder brother Stanford Robinson (1904\u201384) was a popular conductor and composer.His daughter Vivienne Robinson married the magician David Nixon in 1961.\nHe died 24 July 1974 aged 65.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mellotron", "response": ["The first models were designed to be used in the home and contained a variety of sounds, including automatic accompaniments. Bandleader Eric Robinson and television personality David Nixon were heavily involved in introductory promotion of the instruments. A number of other celebrities such as Princess Margaret were early adopters. The instrument began to be used by rock and pop groups in the mid to late 1960s. The Moody Blues's keyboardist Mike Pinder used it extensively on the band's 1967 orchestral collaboration Days of Future Passed. The Beatles used the instrument on several tracks, including the hit single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". The Mellotron was subsequently used by groups like King Crimson and Genesis, becoming a common instrument in progressive rock. Later models, such as the best selling M400, dispensed with the accompaniments and some sound selection controls so it could be used by touring musicians. The instrument's popularity declined in the 1980s after the introduction of polyphonic synthesizers and samplers, despite a number of high-profile users like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and XTC.", "Although tape samplers had been explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The concept of the Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who said they could improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon, they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.", "* Eric Robinson & David Nixon demonstrate: The Mellotron (1965) | British Path\u00e9"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1957", "response": ["* Eric Robinson"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1959", "response": ["* Eric Robinson"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1960", "response": ["* Eric Robinson", "* Eric Robinson"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1963", "response": ["* Eric Robinson", "* Eric Robinson", "* Eric Robinson", "* Eric Robinson"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1965", "response": ["* Eric Robinson"]}, {"page": "Peter and the Wolf", "response": ["| Eric Robinson"]}, {"page": "Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest", "response": ["| Eric Robinson"]}, {"page": "David Nixon (magician)", "response": ["Nixon married Margaret Burton in 1947; the couple divorced in 1952.
