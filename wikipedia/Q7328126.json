He played 20 times for Wednesday between 2006 and 2012, earning a significant amount of first-team appearances elsewhere as he spent time on loan with York City, Buxton, Rotherham United, Oldham Athletic, Grimsby Town, Alfreton Town and Macclesfield Town. He was released in the summer of 2012 and joined Chesterfield.

Mousinho's second goal of the season came in Stevenage's 5\u20131 win against Sheffield Wednesday at Broadhall Way, beating defender Rob Jones for pace before driving a shot from 20-yards past goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell. He injured a metatarsal bone in his right foot in Stevenage's 1\u20130 away victory against Hartlepool United in the FA Cup on 12 November 2011, and was subsequently ruled out of first-team action for six weeks. Mousinho suffered another injury setback in January 2012, when scans revealed further damage to the metatarsal bone. Mousinho returned to the first-team on 14 April 2012, coming on as a late substitute in the club's 6\u20130 away victory at Yeovil Town. He made 23 appearances during an injury-disrupted season, scoring three goals. Three days after their play-off semi-final defeat, on 17 May 2012, Mousinho turned down an improved contract and opted to leave the club after two years."]}, {"page": "Clayton Donaldson", "response": ["Donaldson signed for newly relegated League Two club Bradford City on 14 June 2019 on a one-year contract.

Grimsby who had suffered a goalkeeping crisis in both the past two seasons saw the new seasons preparations stall when Arthur injured his hamstring in the club's defeat against Rushden & Diamonds. Incidentally an injury to his understudy Colgan meant that goalkeeping coach Steve Croudson was called up to replace Arthur for at least one game before Sheffield Wednesday's Richard O'Donnell was signed. Arthur returned to action on 20 September, against Fleetwood Town only to injure his thumb in the warm up, meaning O'Donnell was forced to fill in once again.", "In January 2008, Arthur launched KA Goalkeeping, a website which sells Arthur's own brand of goalkeeper gloves.

On 9 July 2010 Croudson played the second half of Grimsby's 1\u20130 pre-season friendly victory over Non League side Brigg Town. On 30 August 2010 due to injuries to Grimsby keepers Kenny Arthur and Nick Colgan, Croudson was considered to be in contention to make a shock return to the sport to play against Histon in Town's Conference National fixture. Manager Neil Woods eventually confirmed he would play Croudson chosen over youth team keeper Rob Peet and Steve made his first appearance for his home town club since playing in a 2\u20130 defeat at home to Rotherham United on 5 October 2001. The last time Steve had pulled his gloves on for Grimsby the club had been three divisions higher than their current place inside the Conference. In a solid display, reminiscent of his professional debut for Town 11 years previously Steve pulled off some fine saves and Grimsby were victorious to the scoreline of 2\u20131 against Histon and was named the man of the match. On 23 October 2010 Croudson played once again in Grimsby's FA Cup tie with Tamworth following Sheffield Wednesday's decision not to let the Mariners use loanee Richard O'Donnell in a cup fixture."]}]}}
