Wharton (born 1 July 1942) is a former professional footballer who scored 98 goals in 347 appearances in the English Football League. He played as a winger for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Bolton Wanderers, Crystal Palace, Walsall and Kidderminster Harriers in a 17-year senior career spanning from 1957 to 1974.\nOutside of England he played for the Los Angeles Wolves, effectively Wolverhampton Wanderers under another name, in the United Soccer Association and for Durban City in South Africa.\nRenowned for his penalty-taking, Wharton converted 43 penalty kicks out of the 44 that he took during his career. This would rank him among the top three most successful penalty takers in Football League history alongside Graham Alexander (49 out of 51) and Matthew Le Tissier (47 out of 48).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Los Angeles Wolves", "response": ["*  Terry Wharton (F) (1967) 10 apps."]}, {"page": "USA Final 1967", "response": ["| MF ||7||  Terry Wharton"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["Nottingham Forest were the next visitors to Portman Road on 4 November, and despite them having considerably more chances to score, a solitary effort from Phillips midway through the first half was sufficient for Ipswich to take both points.  The following week saw Ipswich travel to Molineux where they faced Wolverhampton Wanderers.  The visitors were down to ten men after just six minutes as Roy Stephenson was forced to withdraw following a thigh injury.  Two late goals from Wolves, from Terry Wharton and Alan Hinton, resulted in a 2\u20130 defeat for Ipswich.  Matt Busby's Manchester United were Ipswich's opponents at Portman Road on 18 November, with the home side winning 4\u20131 with goals from Phillips (2), Crawford and Elsworthy, and United's late consolation goal coming from Sammy McMillan.  Both Busby and Ramsey acclaimed Phillips, the former suggesting that he had the \"hardest and most accurate shot in the game at present\" while the latter agreed: \"Ted is the best shot of my time.\"  The final game of November saw Ipswich visit Ninian Park where they faced Cardiff City.  With a performance described in the East Anglian Daily Times as \"deadly\", \"efficient\" and \"polished and planned\", the home team won 3\u20130 with goals from Moran and Phillips (2).  They finished the month in second place in the league, three points behind Burnley who had a game in hand, and a point ahead of West Ham United and Everton.   "]}]}}
