Some historians argue that the usual tendency of the German leadership was to be extremely guarded when discussing the Final Solution. For example, Mark Roseman wrote that euphemisms were \"their normal mode of communicating about murder\". However, Jeffrey Herf has argued that the role of euphemisms in Nazi propaganda has been exaggerated, and in fact Nazi leaders often made direct threats against Jews. For example, during his speech of 30 January 1939, Hitler threatened \"the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe\".", "David Cesarani emphasises the improvised, haphazard nature of Nazi policies in response to changing war time conditions in his overview, Final Solution: The Fate of the European Jews 1933\u201349 (2016). \"Cesarani provides telling examples\", wrote Mark Roseman, \"of a lack of coherence and planning for the future in Jewish policy, even when we would most expect it. The classic instance is the invasion of Poland in 1939, when not even the most elementary consideration had been given to what should happen to Poland's Jews either in the shorter or longer term. Given that Poland was home to the largest Jewish population in the world, and that, in a couple of years, it would house the extermination camps, this is remarkable.\""]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Mark Roseman (born 1958)"]}, {"page": "Peter Longerich", "response": ["Peter Longerich (born 1955 in Krefeld) is a German professor of history.

It's the equation that I find highly troubling.\" Evans later conceded that Snyder's own critical review of Evans' The Third Reich at War, published the year before in The New York Review of Books, was \"one of the many reasons Snyder's book made [him] so cross.\" For Snyder's review of Evans' book, see "]}, {"page": "Roseman", "response": ["*Mark Roseman (born 1958), English historian of modern Europe with particular interest in The Holocaust"]}, {"page": "Bund: Gemeinschaft f\u00fcr ein sozialistisches Leben", "response": ["The Bund consisted of several hundred core members and many other participants trying to implement an objectively ethical standard of living in Germany.

Browning said that the speech has to be considered in light of the anti-Jewish policies of the next two years, rather than with the retrospective knowledge of Auschwitz. Browning also wrote that the anti-Jewish policies pursued by the Nazis from 1939 to early 1941 (before the Final Solution), would have resulted in a great reduction in the Jewish population and argues that this would have been viewed as fulfilling the prophecy. The historian Mark Roseman contends that \"there is no evidence that mass extermination was being planned in 1939\" and points out that Hitler did not emphasize his prophecy in 1940. He asserts that it is impossible to know what Hitler's intent was in 1939 based on the prophecy. He also argues that it is unclear whether \"annihilation\" referred to expulsion or mass murder and points out that Hitler repeatedly spoke of the forcible banishment of the Jews from Germany."]}]}}
