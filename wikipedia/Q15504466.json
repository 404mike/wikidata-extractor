In association with his father, he became involved in the management of newspapers including The Advertiser; he also served as editor of The Saturday Express and as a journalist. After The Advertiser was sold in 1929 and converted to a public company, he became a director, and for a time vice-chairman; an association that continued until his death. In 1901 he began a long association with the Adelaide City Council, serving as Mayor of Adelaide (1911\u20131913) and later as Lord Mayor of Adelaide (1927\u20131930). He was knighted in 1935. The now removed Lavington Bonython Fountain on North Terrace was erected in front of the SA Museum in his honour.", "link_mentions": {}}}
