The first time this occurred was in November 2001 when Leicester City came to Old Trafford. As Muzzy Izzet prepared to take a penalty, Barthez stood aside from the goal, with his hands behind him on the post. Izzet, tired of waiting, slotted the ball in the bottom corner, but referee Andy D'Urso made him retake the penalty, this time with Barthez in goal. Izzet went the same way, but Barthez denied him with a fine save to his right. An almost identical incident happened less than a year later in October 2002, when Barthez was unhappy about the awarding of a penalty to Fulham, and so went from post to post banging his boots, and refused to be in goal for the penalty. This time he was booked for his antics by referee Mike Dean, and so he then took his place between the posts and made it work again by saving Steed Malbranque's spot kick."]}, {"page": "Whitechapel", "response": ["* Muzzy Izzet, footballer"]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["*  Muzzy Izzet (2002)", "*  Muzzy Izzet 319", "* 2003 \u2013 First Division \u2013  Muzzy Izzet,  Paul Dickov"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Muzzy Izzet"]}, {"page": "Neil Kilkenny", "response": ["At the start of the 2005\u201306 season he became part of the Birmingham first-team squad, though manager Steve Bruce warned him that he would not easily find his way into the team. On 20 September 2005, he made his Birmingham first-team debut in the League Cup away at Scunthorpe United, as a 26th-minute substitute to replace the injured Muzzy Izzet. Four days later, with six other midfielders unavailable through injury or suspension, he made his full home debut against Liverpool in the Premier League, in which he was sent off late in the game for handling the ball on the goal-line, thus giving Liverpool a penalty and a 2\u20132 draw. Despite his dismissal, he received words of encouragement from teammates Mikael Forssell and Mario Melchiot for his performance, and went on to make 25 appearances in all competitions, mainly as substitute, as Birmingham were relegated to the Championship. The following season Kilkenny's appearances were infrequent; he started only two games, both in the League Cup. The player became frustrated; while part of the first-team squad, he was rarely part of the first team, yet Bruce was reluctant to allow him out on loan."]}, {"page": "Stephen Clemence", "response": ["In the 2004\u201305 season, Clemence's first team chances were again in the balance when the club signed Muzzy Izzet, but he stated he would fight for his place in the team.

Clemence suffered a calf problem in a 1\u20130 defeat to Aston Villa two days later, and on 4 April 2006, he tore a hamstring in a 1\u20130 win over Bolton Wanderers, sidelining him for the remainder of the season as Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League."]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["The club lost their talismanic Turk Muzzy Izzet in the summer of 2004.

A long-range shot from David Beckham deflected in off Teddy Sheringham three minutes later, before Beckham himself got on the scoresheet with a direct free kick to salvage a point for the home side, setting a precedent for things to come. The team's first away game followed at West Ham United, but despite the debut of striker Dwight Yorke, United were held to a goalless draw. Beckham, who had become a national hate figure after his dismissal at the World Cup, received a torrid reception by the home supporters, with every touch of the ball made by him jeered at. Bottles and stones were directed at the team bus prior to kick-off.

In the semi-final, Leicester beat Stoke City 1\u20130 in the first leg, at home and drew the second leg, 0\u20130, to qualify for the final. What followed was one of the only two incidents that \"bugged\" Roberts during his playing career: while celebrating the win, he suddenly realised he was in danger due to a pitch invasion by Stoke supporters. He managed to escape, but some of his team-mates, including Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet were less fortunate, and had to be protected by police. The other \"incident\" mentioned was a series of poison pen letters that were sent to him during his time at Wolverhampton Wanderers and Norwich City.  Although it was reported that Roberts had recovered from injury, he was not selected for the squad for the play-off final against Crystal Palace.  Leicester won the match which secured them promotion to the Premiership. With the side promoted again, Leicester decided to sell Roberts to Wolves. In all, Roberts scored 41 goals in 100 league games for Leicester."]}]}}
