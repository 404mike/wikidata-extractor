Originally a top-order batsman, his developing medium pace bowling has made him an all-rounder. Bopara has also played for Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League, Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League, Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League and Chittagong Vikings in the Bangladesh Premier League.\nBopara was first called up to the England One Day International team in 2007, before a difficult Test debut in Sri Lanka saw him dropped in early 2008 after a string of three ducks. He regained his place for a Test against the West Indies in the winter of 2008\u201309; on his return to the side, Bopara became the fifth batsman to score three consecutive Test centuries for England. Despite this success, during the 2009 Ashes Bopara again struggled and was dropped for the final Test of the series. At the start of the 2016 season he took over the captaincy of the Essex one day team.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 4", "response": ["*1985 \u2013 Ravi Bopara, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Shoaib Malik", "response": ["Shoaib Malik was appointed the captain of the Karachi Kings in the first PSL tournament. His team under his captaincy won only two matches in the whole tournament which also affected his own performance. In the last match, he handed over the captaincy to Ravi Bopara and appeared as a player in the match. He was retained by the kings for the second season. He had a much better season compared to the first one, as he scored runs in crucial matches and ended the season as third highest-runs scorer for his side, scoring 202 runs in 10 innings. In third season, he joined new PSL franchise Multan Sultans as their captain. He led his team well during the first part of the tournament but couldn't maintain the form when it mattered the most, as a result finished the tournament at 5th place. He had a good tournament with bat as well, scoring 224 runs across 8 innings with a strike rate of 124.44. As a result of the termination of the Multan Sultans franchise before the fourth season of the PSL due to fee-payment issues, the PCB created a new team up for bidding, temporarily named as The Sixth Team, of which Malik is was assigned the role of captain. After being demoted from Platinum category to Diamond Category and after being released by Multan Sultans, Shoaib Malik was picked by Peshawar Zalmi in the 2020 Pakistan Super League players draft and will play in the 2020 Pakistan Super League representing Peshawar Zalmi as an all-rounder."]}, {"page": "Forest Gate", "response": ["Other sportsmen and women connected with Forest Gate include heavyweight boxing champions Billy Wells and Lennox Lewis, 7 times world karate champion Molly Samuel MBE, cricketer Ravi Bopara, sprinter Damien Greaves, Olympic fencer Linda Strachan, and Olympic and Commonwealth Games athlete Jean Desforges."]}, {"page": "Kevin Pietersen", "response": ["Pietersen joined the England Ashes squad in June 2009 for the upcoming 2009 Ashes series.

He also seemed to flare up his Achilles injury again suddenly which hampered his batting a bit. In the second innings he was bowled for 8 after leaving a straight ball from Ben Hilfenhaus. Many pundits thought the criticism of England's key batsman from the first innings possibly affected him. In the first innings at Lords, after proving his fitness, he came at 222\u20132 and played some trademark shots before being caught behind off Peter Siddle. In the second innings he came in when England had a lead of almost 300 and he and Ravi Bopara batted for time. Pietersen limped when he ran and many shots ran off the inside edge which raised serious doubts for the rest of the series. He actually did well to reach 44 before being caught behind off Siddle again. After struggling in the field as England won, Pietersen was ruled out of the rest of the series with an Achilles injury. This brought to an end 54 consecutive Test matches. As his recovery slowed, Pietersen was not included in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy and Andy Flower speculated that due to an infection of the wound Pietersen \"may miss this winter's tour of South Africa because of slow progress in recovery from surgery.\""]}, {"page": "Essex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Ravi Bopara"]}, {"page": "British Asian", "response": ["* Ravi Bopara"]}, {"page": "Sussex County Cricket Club", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|23|| Ravi Bopara\u00a0 ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium || White ball contract", "* Ravi Bopara"]}, {"page": "Ian Bell", "response": ["Bell was selected to play in the third Test at Edgbaston, his home ground, replacing the injured Kevin Pietersen.
