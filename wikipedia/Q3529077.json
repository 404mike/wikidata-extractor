He worked during the early period when the role of pathogenic organisms in disease were beginning to triumph over the older miasma theory. He was one of the first to identify the role of nematode worms in filariasis. His studies include those on cholera, leprosy, trypanosoma, and fungal infections.\nLewis was born at Llanboidy, Carmarthenshire to William Lewis and Britania n\u00e9e Richards and he grew up on the family farm at Pembrokeshire. After studying at Narberth National School the grammar school run by Joseph and William Edward Morris he apprenticed to a Narberth chemist. He moved to London when he was nineteen and worked as a chemist in Streatham and later at the German Hospital where he picked up the German language. He also attended lectures at the University College London, received a Fellowes silver medal in 1866 and qualified from Aberdeen University in 1867. In 1868 he joined the army service at Netley and rose to the position of a surgeon-major. He worked for three months at Munich with Max von Pettenkofer and then was posted to Calcutta in 1869. In Calcutta he worked with David Douglas Cunningham. Pettenkofer had suggested that soil conditions helped in cholera outbreaks while Ernst Hallier of Jena had suggested that it was caused by a fungus. Lewis tried to examine these hypotheses making studies of meteorological conditions and examining the stools of infected patients. A study with Cunningham was made on fungal skin infections. While making studies of chyluria, he noticed worms in the urine of a patient which was later found to be filaria and were independently discovered and described by Joseph Bancroft. Lewis examined microscopic organisms in the blood of birds and mammals, and named several species of microbes including a trypanosome, Trypanosoma lewisi, from a rat. He married Emily Frances n\u00e9e Brown on 8 October 1879.  In 1883 he returned to England and worked as a Professor of Pathology at Netley. In 1885 he served as honorary secretary of a committee to study Koch's discovery of cholera. Lewis and his committee members (Heneage Gibbes and Emanuel Klein) submitted an official refutation of Koch's study which may have involved not just science but the position of government officials (such as Sir Joseph Fayrer and J.M. Cuningham) , several of whom opposed the contagion theory which would lead the implementation of quarantine regulations that would come greatly in the way of trade and movement. He died on 7 May 1886 of pneumonia, suspected to have been contracted in a laboratory accident.He is one of twenty three whose names are included in a frieze at the entrance of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1870 in Wales", "response": ["*Timothy Richards Lewis discovers a nematoid worm, later Filaria sanguinis hominis."]}, {"page": "1869 in Wales", "response": ["**Timothy Richards Lewis goes to India to study cholera."]}, {"page": "David Douglas Cunningham", "response": ["Cunningham was born in 1843, in Prestonpans, the third son of Cecilia Margaret Douglas (1813\u201398), daughter of David Douglas, Lord Reston (1769\u20131819), the heir of Adam Smith, and her husband the Rev. William Bruce Cunningham (1806\u201378). He attended the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and graduated with honours in medicine from the University of Edinburgh in 1867. His brother Robert Oliver Cunningham also became a surgeon and zoologist. He entered the Indian Medical Service in 1868, and was selected to conduct a special enquiry into cholera by the Secretaries of State for India and for War. He studied for a time in Munich, and arrived in Calcutta in January 1869 along with another physician Timothy Richards Lewis (1841\u20131886). From 1874 he was appointed as a special assistant to the sanitary commissioner of India. In June 1879 he was appointed Professor of Physiology in the Medical College, Calcutta, where he was much engaged in the investigation of cholera. There were multiple competing theories on the nature of diseases in general and cholera in particular. There was a \"miasma\" theory that certain locations had bad air that led to disease and there was a \"contagion\" theory that particles of causal agents entered the body to cause disease and could be carried by a person. In addition there were questions on whether the two theories may both hold and that cholera was caused by a fungus-like organism that produced spores that would be distributed in the air. Cunningham examined many of these theories in India.  He was appointed Surgeon Major of the Bengal Medical Service by 1888 and Honorary Surgeon to the Viceroy of India. He was selected as the Naturalist for the Tibet Mission of 1886."]}, {"page": "Trypanosoma lewisi", "response": ["Trypanosomes in the blood of rats were first noted and described by Timothy Richards Lewis from Calcutta and the species was named after him. In the 1900s, a parasitologist noticed that Rattus macleari, a species of rat endemic to Christmas Island, were becoming sick. The suspected cause was a species of trypanosomes. There was no proof that this was actually correct until scientists from the American Museum of Natural History deposited some rats that had been collected from Christmas Island as specimens into museums. Scientists argue that Trypanosoma lewisi is partially or wholly responsible for the subsequent extinction of Rattus macleari. The parasites were transmitted from fleas infesting the then recently introduced black rats (Rattus rattus)."]}, {"page": "Tim Lewis (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Timothy Richards Lewis (1841\u20131886), Welsh surgeon and pathologist"]}]}}
