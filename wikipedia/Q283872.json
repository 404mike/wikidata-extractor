As a child actress, she appeared in supporting roles in The Children's Hour and The Birds. She is best known for her roles in the 1970s science fiction films Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien, winning a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for the latter. In the 1980s, she appeared in The Right Stuff and The Witches of Eastwick. In the 1990s, she received three Emmy nominations as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her roles on the television series ER and The X-Files.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 20", "response": ["*1949 \u2013 Veronica Cartwright, English-American actress"]}, {"page": "1949", "response": ["** Veronica Cartwright, English-born American actress"]}, {"page": "Sigourney Weaver", "response": ["Weaver performed in the first production of the Stephen Sondheim musical The Frogs while at Yale, alongside Larry Blyden and fellow students Meryl Streep and Durang. She was briefly an understudy in a John Gielgud production of Captain Brassbound's Conversion thereafter. She also acted in original plays by Durang. She appeared in an off-Broadway production of Durang's comedy Beyond Therapy in 1981, which was directed by then-fledgling director Jerry Zaks. Before her on-screen breakthrough, she had appeared only in commercials, a few television roles (including an appearance in the soap opera Somerset), and had a small part in the 1977 Woody Allen comedy Annie Hall. Her originally more substantial Annie Hall role was scaled back due to her commitment to the Durang play Titanic. Weaver appeared two years later as Warrant Officer / Lieutenant Ripley in Ridley Scott's blockbuster film Alien (1979), in a role initially designated to co-star British-born actress Veronica Cartwright until a late change in casting. Cartwright stated to World Entertainment News Network (WENN) that she was in England ready to start work on Alien when she discovered that she would be playing the navigator Lambert in the project, and Weaver had been given the lead role of Ellen Ripley. Weaver reprised the role in the immediate sequel to Alien, similarly titled Aliens. Directed by James Cameron, critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"Weaver, who is onscreen almost all the time, comes through with a very strong, sympathetic performance: She's the thread that holds everything together.\"Ebert, Roger July 18, 1986 Sun Times Aliens review by Roger Ebert, suntimes.com; retrieved September 21, 2010.
