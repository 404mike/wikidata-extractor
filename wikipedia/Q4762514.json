She is a professor of communications at Goldsmiths College, University of London.\nMcRobbie's academic research spans almost four decades, influenced by the work of Stuart Hall and the British sociologists of the school of Birmingham in its inception, and developed from the theoretical traditions of feminism and Marxism. McRobbie has authored many books and scholarly articles on young women and popular culture, gender and sexuality, the British fashion industry, social and cultural theory, the changing world of work and the new creative economy, feminism and the rise of neoliberalism.\nHer most famous book The Aftermath of Feminism (2008, German edition published in 2010), draws on Foucault to decipher the various technologies of gender which are directed towards young woman as 'subjects of capacity'. Her most recent book, Be Creative? Making a Living in the New Culture Industries, was published in 2016 by Polity Press.\nMcRobbie has also served on academic editorial boards for several journals, including the Journal of Cultural Economy, Journal of Consumer Culture, The Communication Review and Culture Unbound. She regularly contributes to BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour and Thinking Allowed, and has written for openDemocracy and The Guardian's Comment is Free.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rock music", "response": ["Professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in rock genres such as heavy metal although bands such as Within Temptation have featured women as lead singers with men playing instruments.

In popular music, there has been a gendered \"distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation\" in music. \"Several scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities\".J.

As the field developed, it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender. Cultural studies is concerned with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice."]}, {"page": "Angela mcrobbie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Angela McRobbie "]}, {"page": "Fooled Around and Fell in Love", "response": ["In their 1990 essay \"Rock and Sexuality\", Simon Frith and Angela McRobbie offer the song as one which \"lyrically captures\" their idea of an essential distinction in rock music between \"cock rock\" and \"teeny bop\"."]}, {"page": "Feminism in culture", "response": ["Feminism has affected culture in many ways, and has famously been theorized in relation to culture by Angela McRobbie, Laura Mulvey and others.
