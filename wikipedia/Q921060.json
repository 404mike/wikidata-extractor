Villa legend Harry Hampton transferred to Blues after the First World War and helped the club to the Second Division title. The last established first-team player to make this move was Des Bremner in 1984, though there had been loan signings and movement of youth players during this period. The most recent permanent transfer from Aston Villa to Birmingham City was that of Gary Gardner in Summer 2019, his brother Craig was the previous player to move from Villa to Birmingham in 2010.

A crowd of 7,240 watched the game on 7 September 2010. The England under-21s returned to Colchester for a 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifier on 11 November 2011.

Full England international Marcus Rashford made his England under-21 debut in the game, scoring a hat-trick as England scored six times against Norway. The other scorers were Nathaniel Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Lewis Baker.

He made what the Birmingham Mail dubbed an authoritative full debut playing in central midfield, looking \"assured on the ball, intelligent off it\", and away to Preston North End a week later he \"looked even more accomplished\" in the centre of a back three before moving into midfield from where he crossed the ball for Gary Gardner's winning goal.
