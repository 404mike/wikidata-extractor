He was principally active in British television from the 1960s to the mid-1980s, which included a period as a script editor and writer of Doctor Who from 1977 to 1979, although he occasionally contributed to televised productions until 1999. \nBeginning in the 1980s, he launched a second career as a print author, concentrating largely on World War II histories. He was also a chair of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain. From 2004 he regularly wrote prose fiction, mainly in the form of a revival of his television series The Baker Street Boys (1983).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gallifrey", "response": ["The television series and people involved in its production repeatedly refer to the Time Lords as a species. In The War Games (1969), the Second Doctor says the Time Lords are \"an immensely civilised race\". Writer Malcolm Hulke and writer and script editor Terrance Dicks repeat this description in their 1972 book The Making of Doctor Who. In The Time Warrior (1973\u201374), Commander Linx quotes Sontaran military intelligence as describing the Time Lords as \"A race of great technical achievement, but lacking the morale to withstand a determined assault.\" In Pyramids of Mars (1975), Sutekh calls the Time Lords \"a perfidious species\". In \"School Reunion\" (2006), the alien Krillitane Mr Finch calls the Time Lords \"such a pompous race\". In \"Smith and Jones\" (2007), the Tenth Doctor answers \"what sort of species [he is]\" with \"I'm a Time Lord.\" In \"Human Nature\" (2007), Tim Latimer hears a voice saying, \"Last of the Time Lords, the last of that wise and ancient race.\" In \"Utopia\" (2007), the Tenth Doctor answers \"what species are you\" with \"Time Lord, last of.\" In \"The Sound of Drums\" (2007), the Tenth Doctor calls the Time Lords \"the oldest and most mighty race in the universe\". In \"Planet of the Dead\" (2009), the Tenth Doctor says, \"I come from a race of people called Time Lords.\" About sixteen minutes into \"Let's Kill Hitler\" (2011), a computer readout describes the \"Pilot Species\" of the Doctor's ship the TARDIS as \"Time Lord\". In \"The Witch's Familiar\" (2015), Davros describes a prophecy that spoke of a \"hybrid creature [of] two great warrior races forced together to create a warrior greater than either,\" and believes that the creature being referred to was \"half Dalek, half Time Lord.\" In \"Before the Flood\" (2015), the Fisher King describes the Time Lords as \"the most warlike race in the galaxy\". In \"Hell Bent\" (2015), the General describes the Hybrid as being \"crossbred between two warrior races\". He says it is supposed that these races are \"the Daleks and the Time Lords\". In \"Knock Knock\" (2017), the Twelfth Doctor tells Bill Potts the Time Lords are \"my species\". Writing in issue No. 356 of Doctor Who Magazine, head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies describes the Time Lords as \"the Doctor's race\". In a special feature on the DVD set of The Invasion of Time, script editor Anthony Read called the Time Lords \"an interesting species to somebody coming in\". In a special feature on the DVD and Blu-ray set of series 8, actor Peter Capaldi said the Doctor belongs to \"a race called the Time Lords\". Terrance Dicks recalled in a 2016 interview in The Essential Doctor Who magazine that during a discussion of The War Games, producer Derrick Sherwin said the Doctor belongs to \"this mysterious race called Time Lords\". The Time Lords are also referred to as a race by media outlets including the Radio Times and The New York Times, while a correction in a 2014 NPR article claims that \"not all Gallifreyans are Time Lords\". \"The Stolen Tardis\" (1979), a spin-off comic printed in issue No. 9 of Doctor Who Weekly (the original name of Doctor Who Magazine) also claims that \"not everyone on Gallifrey is a Time Lord\", while a feature in issue No. 21 instead states that the Doctor is \"a member of a race called the Time Lords\"."]}, {"page": "November 21", "response": ["*  2015   \u2013 Anthony Read, English screenwriter and producer (b. 1935)"]}, {"page": "The Pirate Planet", "response": ["The original draft for this story was extremely complex: centred on a Time Lord trapped in a giant aggression-absorbing machine and several paradoxes, it had to be heavily simplified by the script editor, Anthony Read."]}, {"page": "Sapphire & Steel", "response": ["Sapphire & Steel is a British television supernatural sci-fi/fantasy series starring David McCallum as Steel and Joanna Lumley as Sapphire.

In 1981, it was alleged by Anthony Read and David Fisher that Lucy was, at its heart, a British Secret Service operation intended to get Ultra information to the Soviets in a convincing way untraceable to British codebreaking operations against the Germans. Stalin had shown considerable suspicion of any information from the British about German plans to invade Russia in 1941, so an Allied effort to find a way to get helpful information to the Soviets in a form that would not be dismissed is, at least, not implausible. That the Soviets had, via their own espionage operations, learned of the British break into important German message traffic was not, at the time, known to the British. Various observations have suggested that Allan Foote was more than a mere radio operator: he was in a position to act as a radio interface between SIS and Roessler, and also between Roessler and Moscow; his return to the West in the 1950s was unusual in several ways; and his book was similarly troublesome. They also point out that not one of Roessler's claimed sources in Germany has been identified or has come forward. Hence their suspicion that, even more so than for most espionage operations, the Lucy ring was not what it seemed."]}, {"page": "Alexander Foote", "response": ["In March 1947, following the defection of a Soviet agent who had been involved with British Intelligence, Foote's allegiance to the British may have been confirmed.

The actor now felt very possessive of the part and frequently argued with directors over his inclusion of ad-libbed lines, but he was extremely pleased when the levity of the show increased even further after the departure of Read and the hiring of Douglas Adams as script editor for season seventeen in 1979. Some fans have criticised Adams for introducing too much of the sort of humorous content that served him well in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The script was written in just two weeks, with four days for rewrites. Additionally, when asked about the unused script at a convention, Graham Williams, having forgotten the exact title, made up the name \"Gin Sengh\", as in The Killer Cats of Gin Sengh (or Geng Singh\u2014the spelling being indeterminate), resulting in the fan myth that this was the original title.

Williams also wrote significant portions of the scripts for two stories beset by writing problems, The Invasion of Time (1978) and City of Death (1979). Although the viewing figures dipped somewhat during Williams' first two seasons, they remained healthy and in 1979 the series achieved its highest ever ratings of 16.1 million viewers (for episode 4 of City of Death), although this was partly attributable to the strike which took the BBC's then-only rival, ITV, off the air."]}, {"page": "The Ribos Operation", "response": ["Working titles for this story include Operation and The Ribos File.

The fifteenth anniversary of the programme took place on 23 November 1978, five days after the broadcast of episode four. To commemorate this, Anthony Read asked David Fisher to write a new scene (expanded by Darrol Blake) featuring Romana and K9 surprising the Doctor with a cake celebrating his 751st birthday and a new, identical scarf.
