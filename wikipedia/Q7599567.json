The group's manager, Peter Grant, believed that they would be better served by the big screen than by television, because he regarded the sound quality of the latter as unsatisfactory. The first attempt was the filming (by Peter Whitehead and Stanley Dorfman) of Led Zeppelin's Royal Albert Hall performance on 9 January 1970,  but the band thought they appeared dated when they viewed the edited footage several months later, and the film was shelved (this footage was later remastered and featured on the 2003 release Led Zeppelin DVD)."]}, {"page": "Dusty Springfield", "response": ["Produced by Stanley Dorfman.

Contrary to popular belief, it was not filmed at the Studio 54 nightclub; Chris Stein said that \"in the video, there's a shot of the legendary Studio 54, so everyone thought we shot the video there, but it was actually in a short-lived club called the Copa or something\". The video begins with footage of New York City at night before joining Blondie on stage. Then, the video alternates between close-ups of Debbie Harry's face as she lip-syncs and mid-distance shots of the entire band. Harry said, \"For the video, I wanted to dance around but they told us to remain static, while the cameras moved around. God only knows why. Maybe we were too clumsy.\""]}, {"page": "Be My Wife", "response": ["\"Be My Wife\" apparently was Bowie's first official video since \"Life on Mars?\". The video is in fact rather similar: Bowie stands alone against a white backdrop singing the song alone. However, Stanley Dorfman's new clip featured a Bowie in make-up and clothing influenced by Buster Keaton and giving an irreverent, detached performance on a guitar, which does gel with the candid feeling generated by the song."]}, {"page": "Led Zeppelin United Kingdom Tour 1970", "response": ["This tour is arguably best known for the band's performance at the Royal Albert Hall on 9 January.Led Zeppelin official website: concert summary According to Led Zeppelin guitarist, Jimmy Page, the Royal Albert hall was \"at the time the largest and most prestigious gig in London.\"Liner notes by Cameron Crowe for The Song Remains the Same, reissued version, 2007.
