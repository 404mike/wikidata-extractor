These crystals are composed of nearly linear Hg(CN)2 molecules with a C-Hg-C bond angle of 175.0\u00b0 and an Hg-C-N bond angle of 177.0\u00b0 (AylettAylett, B.J. \"Mercury (II) Pseudohalides: Cyanide, Thiocyanate, Selenocyanate, Azide, Fulminate.\" Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry 3:304-306.

Raman spectra show that the molecules distort at higher pressures. Between 16-20 kbar, the structure undergoes a phase transition as the Hg(II) center changes from 2- to 4-coordinate as the CN groups bind to neighboring Hg centers forming via Hg-N bonds. The coordination geometry thus changes from tetragonal to tetrahedral, forming a cubic crystal structure, analogous to the structure of Cd(CN)2. Due to the ambidentate nature of the CN ligands, this tetrahedral structure is distorted, but the distortion lessens with increasing pressure until the structure becomes nearly perfectly tetrahedral at >40 kbar.Wong, P.T.T.
