He was born at Whinmoor, Leeds, Yorkshire and died at Monifieth, Angus, Scotland.\nStow was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper, and although his record appears modest by modern standards, he was an integral part of the Cambridge team for three seasons from 1867 to 1869, and was captain in his final year. In all three seasons he won a Blue by appearing in the University Match against Oxford University, and as captain he led his team to victory in the 1869 game. After he left Cambridge University he played in only one further first-class match, a game between two \"Gentlemen\" sides in 1871.\nStow graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1870, which was converted to a Master of Arts in 1873. He qualified as a solicitor in 1873 and was a partner in the firm of Stow, Preston and Lyttelton in Lincoln's Inn Fields in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*John Montague Stow (1911\u20131997), Governor-General of Barbados (1966\u20131967)", "*Montague Stow (1847\u20131911), English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "William Lane (cricketer)", "response": ["He married Edith Stow.
