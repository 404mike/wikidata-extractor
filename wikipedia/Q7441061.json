He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at \"half pace\". His long-term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground's Butler Street stand, and a lack of adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair; Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 1976\u201377. Following relegation Smith formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 1978\u201379 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were \"boring\", as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too much of a threat for him.", "In his second season as York manager, 1983\u201384, he signed another former teammate, energetic midfielder Sean Haslegrave. Smith was named as the division's Manager of the Month for March 1984 after York won five and drew one of their six league matches. He guided York to the Fourth Division title and promotion into the Third Division, with Walwyn scoring 25 goals and earning a place in the PFA Team of the Year alongside strike partner John Byrne, who scored 27 goals. York finished with 101 points, 16 points ahead of runners-up Doncaster Rovers."]}, {"page": "Cardinal Newman College", "response": ["* Sean Haslegrave, professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sean Haslegrave"]}, {"page": "1971\u201372 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sean Haslegrave"]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sean Haslegrave"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sean Haslegrave"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sean Haslegrave"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sean Haslegrave"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["The 1976\u201377 season opened with a new all steel Butler Street roof in place which would cost the sum of \u00a3250,000.
