He was described as \"second only in popularity to Chaplin in Britain at the height of his career,\" and as displaying \"a proto-Pythonesque humour of the absurd.\" Critic Barry Anthony wrote that \"in many ways the topical skits of Pimple have more in common with The Crazy Gang, Benny Hill, the Goons, Monty Python or topical sketch shows like French and Saunders and The Fast Show than with the classic Hollywood silent comedies.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
