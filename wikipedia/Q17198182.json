The project has received both local and national support. Naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough has become a patron, as well as trustee Sir Tim Smit, the creator of the Eden Project. The initial sketches of the site have been created by Renzo Piano (architect of The Shard in London), whilst the site's engineering is being led by the team responsible for the Eden Project and the refurbishment of Sydney Opera House. Hanlon has been quoted that the idea is \"very big and ambitious\", and that the site will \"aim to be a spectacular world-class visitor attraction\", as well as an \"educational and heritage-focused charitable trust, acting as a hub for the Jurassic Coast UNESCO World Heritage Site.\" Attenborough has stated \"My own love of science began with fossils, and this period and area are so very, very important in history and for Britain itself. The area is one about which Britain can be very proud because it is the birthplace of paleontology. The pity has been that this area has lacked a single focus and this is what Jurassica could do.\""]}, {"page": "Eternity: Our Next Billion Years", "response": ["Eternity: Our Next Billion Years is a non-fiction book which speculates about the future of mankind written by science writer Michael Hanlon.
