A week after Bellefonds\u2019 visit Chantelou noticed that Bernini had in fact added a lock of hair onto the forehead of the bust\u2026 The addition of this lock, of which Bernini was very proud, could only be achieved by cutting back all the upper part of the forehead except for the curl itself. This was later to be criticized adversely, and it did in fact falsify the shape of the King\u2019s forehead.\u201dThe anecdote points out that Bernini was more concerned with the technical side of the bust rather than carving with accuracy to the king\u2019s likeness.
