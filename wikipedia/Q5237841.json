The MK Trafford investors comprised Knighton, former Debenhams executive Bob Thornton and Stanley Cohen of the Betterware home shopping company. However, Thornton and Cohen pulled out in mid-September. Knighton sought other backers, with David Murray and Owen Oyston among those approached. Knighton proved to Martin Edwards and his legal team that he had secured funds to complete the deal, but as the deadline to complete the takeover loomed, Knighton abandoned his bid for control in exchange for a seat on the board."]}, {"page": "List of Rangers F.C. players", "response": ["The Rangers F.C. Hall of fame is a list established in 2000 by the then Rangers chairman, David Murray, the first of any club in Britain. He decided that the club should remember and honour the achievements and contribution made by its finest players throughout its history. A mahogany panel above the famous marble staircase was assigned to display the names of those inducted into the Hall of Fame and an annual presentation ceremony was instigated where the players honoured received their award."]}, {"page": "Dalkeith RFC", "response": ["Notable Dalkeith players of the era included Bill Ingram, who later played for Melrose and the South District team, and Tom Jack who played for Gala. Businessman David Murray played for the club until he lost both legs in a car accident while driving home from a match. When the National Leagues were introduced in the 1970s, Dalkeith entered the 7th Division in season 1976\u201377. The club was runner-up in that year, winning promotion to Division 6 alongside Stirling County. The following year the club became champions, having beaten Stirling in front of one of the largest crowds ever seen in King's Park. The peak of the club's league progress was Division 5, and since then the lower reaches of Division 6 & 7. Dalkeith won their own Shield tournament in 1976, and again in 2001 and 2004."]}]}}
