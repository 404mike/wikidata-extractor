He is currently the director of football at Swindon Town.\nChorley started his career at Arsenal, spending several years at the club on youth terms before signing a professional deal in 2001. He spent two months on loan at Brentford at the start of the 2002\u201303 season. Having made no first-team appearances for Arsenal, Chorley opted to leave the club and sign for Wimbledon in 2003. He continued playing under the club's new guise in Milton Keynes for a further three years from 2004 to 2007. During his final year at MK Dons, Chorley spent the majority of the 2006\u201307 season on loan at Gillingham. He left MK Dons in July 2007, and signed a two-year contract with Tranmere Rovers. After two years of regular football at Tranmere, Chorley returned to London, signing for Leyton Orient in June 2009. He made over 150 appearances during his three-and-a-half-year spell at Orient, before signing for Stevenage in January 2013 for an undisclosed fee. Chorley's contract was cancelled by mutual consent in January 2014 and he subsequently signed for Portsmouth.

The EFL described the ownership wrangle as \"concerning\" and imposed a transfer embargo on the club. In pre-season friendlies at Melksham Town and Hungerford Town, Swindon fielded sides featuring just a few experienced first-team players, with the rest of the squads being composed of youngsters and trialists. The club then cancelled its planned pre-season friendly with Swansea City at the County Ground on 17 July 2021, citing \"ongoing logistical and operational issues\".

He doubled his tally for the season a month later in a 1\u20131 draw with Colchester United, when he \"tapped in\" from close range in injury-time to help Orient earn only their second point from their opening seven league matches. He went on to score in comfortable victories over Rochdale and Bromley to end the year in positive fashion as Orient began to climb the League One standings. Smith scored in consecutive away wins in the opening months of 2012; firstly netting from close range in a 2\u20130 win against Preston North End, before denting AFC Bournemouth's play-off hopes with a back post header in a 2\u20131 Orient triumph.

Leyton Orient were reduced to ten men in the first-half, with Ben Chorley receiving a red card for an off-the-ball incident with Chris Beardsley. Stevenage substitute Chuks Aneke was also sent-off in the second half for a high-footed challenge. In the week prior to Stevenage's trip to Rochdale, speculation mounted as to whether Stevenage manager Graham Westley would remain at the club amidst interest from fellow League One side, Preston North End. Westley eventually joined Preston on 13 January, leaving the club after three-and-a-half years in charge. Westley took his back-room staff with him to Preston, meaning captain Mark Roberts was named as player-manager for the club's trip to Spotland on 14 January. The game ended 5\u20131 to Stevenage. Luke Freeman, playing his first game since signing for the club on a permanent basis, scored the opening goal when his shot squirmed under Rochdale goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Kurucz. Shortly after the interval, Stevenage had doubled their advantage when Freeman beat his man down the left, before laying the ball to Chris Beardsley, who in-turn rolled the ball to the onrushing Lawrie Wilson, who scored with a first-time finish. Rochdale reduced the two-goal deficit when loanee Brett Ormerod finished well from Daniel Bogdanovic's driven cross. Stevenage restored their two-goal advantage almost instantly, Lawrie Wilson ran onto Mark Roberts' ball, before finishing neatly past Kurucz. Rochdale defender Joe Widdowson was given a second yellow card shortly after for a foul on Beardsley. Five minutes later, the visitors had a fourth goal, Freeman cut in from the right wing and unleashed a 25-yard drive into the top corner of the goal. Freeman was again involved in Stevenage's fifth goal, whipping in a cross from the left that Byrom side-footed home. Roberts remained in charge for the club's trip to Scunthorpe United a week later, on 21 January, with the game ending in a 1\u20131 draw. Scunthorpe took the lead shortly after the half-time interval, with Garry Thompson collecting a Mark Duffy long ball before firing into the net from 12-yards out. Substitutes Robin Shroot and Darius Charles combined to ensure Stevenage earned a point from the match, with Shroot bringing down Lawrie Wilson's cross into the path of Charles, who turned quickly to beat the outstretched Sam Slocombe from six yards. Stevenage returned to Broadhall Way three days later, after three successive away fixtures in all competitions, hosting Milton Keynes Dons. The away side took the lead after just two minutes, when former Stevenage loanee Jay O'Shea finished from close range after Chris Day had palmed away Adam Smith's cross. Stevenage drew level midway through the first-half following a neat interchange between Luke Freeman and Lawrie Wilson, with Freeman laying the ball off to Michael Bostwick, who unleashed a 25-yard strike into the bottom left corner of the goal. On the hour mark, MK Dons defender Mathias Doumb\u00e9 was sent-off for a second bookable offence after bringing down Chris Beardsley on the edge of the area. Stevenage took the lead from the resulting free-kick, with Scott Laird heading in Freeman's cross. The hosts had doubled their advantage three minutes later, Freeman again supplying the cross that was met by the head of Darius Charles, who firmly headed past MK Dons goalkeeper David Martin. With five minutes remaining, MK Dons scored their second goal of the game, with O'Shea crossing the ball for substitute Tom Flanagan to head into the net from six yards. Stevenage restored their two-goal advantage almost instantly when Charles worked his way into the box before firing the ball across the face of the goal, which was turned in by MK Dons defender Gary MacKenzie."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Leyton Orient F.C. season", "response": ["| Ben Chorley", "|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Ben Chorley", "|Ben Chorley"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Leyton Orient F.C. season", "response": ["| Ben Chorley", "|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Ben Chorley", "|Ben Chorley"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["Ahead of the season, there were wholesale changes involving the playing squad.

Stevenage then faced their second away game in three days, travelling to Griffin Park to face promoting-chasing Brentford. The hosts secured a comfortable 2\u20130 victory, thanks to long-range strikes from Tom Adeyemi and Marcello Trotta. A third straight defeat followed a week later, with Stevenage losing 2\u20131 at home to Oldham Athletic. The home side had taken a one-goal lead into the interval, courtesy of James Dunne's neat finish from the edge of the area. However, Oldham fought back with second-half goals from Dean Furman and James Tarkowski, taking all three points and inflicting Stevenage's eighth defeat in ten matches. Another defeat followed four days later, on 23 February, this time a 2\u20131 loss to Shrewsbury Town at New Meadow. Similarly to their previous match against Oldham, James Dunne gave Stevenage the lead in the first-half. Shrewsbury equalised on the half hour mark, before scoring late-on to secure all three points.
