This passion for arachnids was probably fostered in 1854 in which year he both accompanied the entomologist Frederick Bond on a visit to the New Forest in Hampshire and was introduced to the writings of the arachnologist John Blackwall, with whom he struck up a correspondence, meeting for the first time in 1860. Pickard-Cambridge assisted Blackwall between 1861 and 1864 in the publication of Blackwell's great work, British and Irish Spiders."]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Blackwall \u2013 John Blackwall (1790\u20131881)"]}, {"page": "Giant house spider", "response": ["The first description of a spider now assigned to this species was by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1843, under the name Tegenaria atrica. Other supposedly different species were described later, including Tegenaria saeva  by John Blackwall in 1844, Tegenaria duellica by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1875 and Tegenaria gigantea by Ralph Vary Chamberlin and Wilton Ivie in 1935. T.\u00a0gigantea was synonymized with T.\u00a0duellica in 1978. The three remaining taxa have been regarded as distinct species, particularly in Britain. Thus Roberts (1995) provides distinguishing characters for T.\u00a0atrica, T.\u00a0duellica and T.\u00a0saeva, as does Oxford (2008) for T.\u00a0duellica (as T.\u00a0gigantea) and T.\u00a0saeva. Others consider these three as part of a single morphologically variable species, for which the oldest name, and hence the senior synonym, is T.\u00a0atrica."]}, {"page": "Robert Templeton", "response": ["Much of Templeton's early work and very much in Ceylon was on spiders.

Several studies have since made it possible to analyze this behavior. One of most important and extensive studies exploring ballooning was funded by U.S. Department of Agriculture and performed between 1926 and 1931 by a group of scientists.
