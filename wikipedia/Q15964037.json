He worked with a group of Irish writers producing a paper called Zolius. He moved to England and then wrote short stories for London Illustrated News. Building upon the success of his short stories, he wrote his first novel The Mystery of Killard. Many of the stories are set in locations he would have known. The subject matter is a mixture of detective, crime and mystery.\nHe lived in Clapham in West London with his wife and three children, Margret, Sarah and David. He died at the age of 52, just as he was becoming known as a popular writer. His books were still published for a number of years after his death.\nCopies of the books are kept in the National Library in London and are available on line now they have been digitised.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Fate of Fenella", "response": ["#Richard Dowling, Derelict"]}, {"page": "Dowling (surname)", "response": ["* Richard Dowling (disambiguation), multiple people, including:", "**Richard Dowling (writer) (1846\u20131898), Irish novelist"]}, {"page": "Richard Dowling", "response": ["Richard Dowling or Dick Dowling may refer to:", "*Richard Dowling (writer) (1846\u20131898), Irish novelist"]}, {"page": "Comprised of", "response": ["* \"So the younger division of the party, comprised of Nellie Cahill and Edith Paulton, fell to the rear, and the other division kept the front.\" (1886)Richard Dowling, Tempest-Driven: A Romance (London, 1886); here at Project Gutenberg)."]}, {"page": "Edmund Downey", "response": ["In 1884 Osbert Ward (1857\u20131949) and Edmund Downey were the co-founders of Ward & Downey, which published 277 titles from 1884 to 1897.
