On 28 November 2015, he stood down from his ministerial position due to allegations of bullying within the Conservative Party.After he supported Boris Johnson\u2019s 2019 Conservative leadership bid, when Johnson became prime minister, he appointed Shapps as Transport Secretary in July. Since Shappps assumed the role, it has entailed greater influence than predecessors with the effective nationalisation of the Northern Trains franchise, the Williams-Shapps Review to move from a rail franchise system to concessionary Great British Railways public body (from 2023), COVID-19 travel restrictions to and from the United Kingdom, and the Integrated Rail Plan published in 2021 which sets out the long-term strategy for rail in Northern England and Midlands.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Big Audio Dynamite", "response": ["The band later recruited keyboardist Andre Shapps (co-producer of The Globe, brother of MP Grant Shapps and Mick Jones's cousin) and DJ Michael \" Lord Zonka\" Custance as DJ and vocalist.

There are also nine (ten on Friday) London\u2013Brussels services, with two running non-stop (continuing to Amsterdam) and a further two calling at Lille only. One service daily operates to Amsterdam via Brussels and Rotterdam also calling at Lille. In addition, there is a return trip from London to Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e - Chessy for Disneyland Paris, which runs 4 times a week with increased frequency during school holidays. There are also seasonal services: an up-to-4-times-a-week service to Marseille via Lyon and Avignon in the summer; and, in the winter, \"Snow trains\", aimed at skiers, to Bourg-Saint-Maurice, Aime-la-Plagne and Mo\u00fbtiers in the Alps; these run twice-weekly, one overnight and one during the daytime. Intermediate stations are Ebbsfleet International in northwest Kent, Ashford International in southeast Kent, and Calais-Fr\u00e9thun and Lille-Europe in Nord-Pas-de-Calais. In February 2018, Eurostar announced the start of its long-planned service from London to Amsterdam, with an initial two trains per day from April of that year running between St Pancras and Amsterdam Centraal. This launched as a one-way service, with return trains carrying passengers to Rotterdam and Brussels Midi/Zuid, making a 28-minute stop (which was not deemed long enough to process UK-bound passengers) and then carrying different passengers from Brussels to London. Initially passengers travelling back took a Thalys service to Brussels Midi/Zuid where they could join the Eurostar. This was due to the lack of facilities for juxtaposed controls by the UK Border Force at Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal. On 4 February 2020, the Dutch Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management, Cora van Nieuwenhuizen, and the UK Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, announced that juxtaposed controls would be established at Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal. The direct train from Amsterdam was originally due to launch on 30 April 2020, and from Rotterdam on 18 May 2020, although it was later postponed to 26 October 2020 for both cities due to the COVID-19 pandemic."]}, {"page": "Hatfield, Hertfordshire", "response": ["Hatfield is part of Welwyn Hatfield borough council in the county of Hertfordshire.
