One question for England going into the tour was who would open the batting alongside captain Alastair Cook, something that had been a regular issue for the team since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in 2012. The incumbent in the role was Sam Robson, who had played seven Test matches for England in the summer of 2014, but his performances had been mediocre. He played for England Lions in a tour of South Africa in January 2015, where he made only 46 runs in three innings. The main alternatives for England, Adam Lyth and Alex Lees, had also gone on the tour, but neither had done much better than Robson and neither had any Test match experience. Another option was Jonathan Trott, who had not played an international match for England since the 2013-14 Ashes series, when he left Australia early due to a stress-related illness. Trott captained the England Lions on a tour of South Africa in January 2015 and scored an unbeaten 211 in the first unofficial Test match of the series to put himself back into contention to play for England. Although he had originally batted at number 3 for England, this spot was now filled by Gary Ballance, and Trott had said that he was happy to open the batting instead. England decided to leave Robson out of their squad for the tour, and included both Trott and Lyth as options to replace him."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 2016", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|14|| Alex Lees* ||  ||  || Left-handed || Right arm leg break|| List A and t20 cricket captain", "| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Alex Lees"]}, {"page": "Alex Lees (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alex Lees"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 2021\u201322", "response": ["* Alex Lees (c)"]}]}}
