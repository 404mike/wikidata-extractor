He is credited with being a major influence in these teams' success, and in the attractive, attacking, free-flowing rugby they played. Dawes also had considerable success as a coach with Wales, and coached the 1977 British Lions.

One of the trials forced him to miss the second Swansea encounter of the season, played away on 12 November 1966; his place in the Llanelli team was given to a youth debutant from the Felinfoel club, Phil Bennett.Hughes (1986) p. 199 Bennett became one of the greatest fly-halves produced by Wales, but he was kept from the Wales squad in his early career by the presence of John.Thomas (1979) p. 182 In 1966, John was awarded his first international cap for Wales, taking David Watkins place at fly-half for the match against the touring Australia team.Thomas (1979) p. 154 This was seen as a surprise move by the Welsh Rugby Union selectors, as Watkins had recently returned from a British Lions tour where he was team captain. Wales lost to Australia 11\u20134, the first time the Welsh had been beaten by the 'Wallabies', due to poor form in the midfield, with the criticism aimed at John, Gerald Davies and John Dawes.Sports historian Wayne Thomas in his 1979 book A Century of Welsh Rugby Players (p. 162) places criticism for this loss on the midfield players. Stating \"John himself escaped the worst criticism even though guilty of poor positioning to take Allan Lewis's long pass\". Conversely, John's play during this game is praised by other sources. David Watkins in his 1979 autobiography \"The David Watkins Story\" (p. 101) wrote: \"He [John] played very well and I knew he would retain his place against Scotland,\". John himself, in his 1974 autobiography (p. 69-70), wrote that he \"...hadn't played a blinder... but I hadn't made a lot of mistakes\", and follows this up with an extract from Cliff Morgan's after-match report which stated: \"Barry John had a grand first international and looked as if he could beat the defence at any time.\" Although experiencing defeat in his first international, John managed to gain revenge over Australia just over a month later when the same team faced Llanelli at Stradey Park. Llanelli beat the Wallabies 11\u20130 after a bruising forward contest. John himself scored a try, and then added to his tally with a dropped goal.", "In 1971, on their tour of New Zealand, John was again selected for the British Lions. With the painful memories of the woeful 1969 Wales Tour to New Zealand, John was determined to succeed with the Lions.Griffiths (1990) p. 105 Under the management of Doug Smith and the coaching of Carwyn James (also from Cefneithin), John rose to great individual heights with his match-winning performances. Of the 26\u00a0tour matches, he played in 17, only bettered by captain John Dawes and \"Mighty Mouse\" prop Ian McLauchlan. By the time of the first Test in Carisbrook, John had faced six teams, including the New South Wales Waratahs and the New Zealand M\u0101ori. All six games had been won by the Lions and John had recorded 88 points, including a full house against Waikato. In the First Test John terrorised New Zealand's fullback Fergie McCormick with ruthless tactical kicking. The All Blacks were shunted all over the field by John, who was well protected by his forwards, something that he was not afforded with Wales in 1969. The Lions won the Test 9\u20133, six of the Lions' points coming from two John penalties; McCormick never played for the All Blacks again."]}, {"page": "Phil Bennett", "response": ["Kirkpatrick to Williams.
