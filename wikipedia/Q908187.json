For over twenty years he has been an editor of the journal Nature for which he continues to write regularly. He now writes a regular column in Chemistry World. He has contributed to publications ranging from New Scientist to the New York Times, The Guardian, the Financial Times and New Statesman. He is the regular contributor to Prospect magazine, and also a columnist for Chemistry World, Nature Materials and BBC Future. He has broadcast on many occasions on radio and TV, and in June 2004 he presented a three-part serial on nanotechnology, Small Worlds, on BBC Radio 4.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Many-worlds interpretation", "response": ["Philosopher of science Robert P. Crease says that the MWI is \"one of the most implausible and unrealistic ideas in the history of science\" because it means that everything conceivable happens.

While he acknowledges Lev Vaidman's argument that an experimenter should subjectively expect outcomes in proportion of the \"measure of existence\" of the worlds in which they happen, Ball ultimately rejects this explanation. \"What this boils down to is the interpretation of probabilities in the MWI. If all outcomes occur with 100% probability, where does that leave the probabilistic character of quantum mechanics?\" Furthermore, Ball explains that such arguments highlight what he recognizes as another major problem of the many-world interpretation, connected but independent from the issue of probability: the incompatibility with the notion of selfhood. Ball ascribes most attempts of justifying probabilities in the many-worlds interpretation to \"saying that quantum probabilities are just what quantum mechanics look like when consciousness is restricted to only one world\" but that \"there is in fact no meaningful way to explain or justify such a restriction.\" Before performing a quantum measurement, an \"Alice before\" experimenter \"can't use quantum mechanics to predict what will happen to her in a way that can be articulated - because there is no logical way to talk about 'her' at any moment except the conscious present (which, in a frantically splitting universe, doesn't exist). Because it is logically impossible to connect the perceptions of Alice Before to Alice After [the experiment], \"Alice\" has disappeared. [...] [The MWI] eliminates any coherent notion of what we can experience, or have experienced, or are experiencing right now.\""]}, {"page": "Pattern", "response": ["Foams obey Plateau's laws, which require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant average curvature.

The movement, which is in  time, is entitled \"Scherzo\" but is actually in rondo form. The main theme undergoes many changes, until the end, where it ends quietly, on the very lowest notes of the piano of Beethoven's time. The movement plays with listener expectations through rhythmic ambiguity, unexpected harmonic shifts, and above all, the use of strategically placed silences.
