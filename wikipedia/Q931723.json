After he was recruited by record producer Quincy Jones, he wrote several successful singles for Michael Jackson, including \"Thriller\", \"Off the Wall\", and \"Rock with You\". He also wrote songs for George Benson, including \"Give Me the Night\" and \"Love X Love\", along with Patti Austin and James Ingram's United States number-one single \"Baby, Come to Me\", among many others.\nTemperton wrote the soundtrack for the 1986 film Running Scared and won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his work on Birdland, from Quincy Jones's album Back on the Block.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Benson", "response": ["The Qwest record label (a subsidiary of Warner Bros., run by Quincy Jones) released Benson's breakthrough pop album Give Me The Night, produced by Jones.

He had many hit singles such as \"Love All the Hurt Away,\" \"Turn Your Love Around,\" \"Inside Love,\" \"Lady Love Me,\" \"20/20,\" \"Shiver,\" \"Kisses in the Moonlight.\"  More importantly, Quincy Jones encouraged Benson to search his roots for further vocal inspiration, and he rediscovered his love for Nat Cole, Ray Charles and Donny Hathaway in the process, influencing a string of further vocal albums into the 1990s. Despite returning to his jazz and guitar playing most recently, this theme was reflected again much later in Benson's 2000 release Absolute Benson, featuring a cover of one of Hathaway's most notable songs, \"The Ghetto.\" Benson accumulated three other platinum LPs and two gold albums."]}, {"page": "October 9", "response": ["*1949 \u2013 Rod Temperton, English keyboard player, songwriter, and producer (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "Worms, Germany", "response": ["*Rod Temperton (1949\u20132016), English songwriter, record producer and musician"]}, {"page": "1949", "response": ["* October 9 \u2013 Rod Temperton, English songwriter, record producer and musician (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "2016", "response": ["** Rod Temperton, English songwriter, record producer and musician (b. 1949)"]}, {"page": "Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Rod Temperton (1949\u20132016), songwriter"]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Original Score", "response": ["| Chris Boardman, Jorge Calandrelli, Andra\u00e9 Crouch, Jack Hayes, Jerry Hey, Quincy Jones, Randy Kerber, Jeremy Lubbock, Joel Rosenbaum, Caiphus Semenya, Fred Steiner & Rod Temperton"]}, {"page": "1976 in music", "response": ["* \"Always and Forever\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0w.m.
