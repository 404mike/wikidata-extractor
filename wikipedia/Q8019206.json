He was a right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler who played 107 times for Worcestershire between 1909 and 1925, captaining the county in 1914, 1919 and 1922. He also made three first-class appearances for HK Foster's XI.\nBorn in Sale, Cheshire, Taylor made his debut in Worcestershire's County Championship game against Kent on 14 June 1909, making 19 and 0. He did not bowl in that game; his first wicket was that of Harry Altham in Worcestershire's next game, against Oxford University. For the next few years, with the exception of 1910 when he made 11 appearances, Taylor played only a few times a season.\nHe was made captain in 1914, replacing Henry Foster, and appeared in 21 matches. He scored what was to be his career best of 59 not out against Essex in August of that year, and took 26 wickets at 44.69. The First World War then intervened, but on the resumption of first-class cricket in 1919, Taylor continued as captain. Worcestershire did not participate in the County Championship that summer but instead played a series of friendly matches; it was in one of these, against HK Foster's XI, that he took his first five-wicket innings haul, claiming 5-56.\nFor 1920, and Worcestershire's return to Championship cricket, Taylor was replaced as captain by his brother-in-law, Maurice Jewell, but Taylor continued to play a significant number of matches for the county. 1921 was the most productive season of his career, as he took 35 wickets at 28.28 including five in an innings three times; the best of these being his career-best of 7-64 against Glamorgan at Kidderminster.\nTaylor regained the captaincy for 1922, but had a wretched season: despite playing 17 games, he could manage a mere four wickets costing over 131 runs apiece, to go with 214 runs at 8.23. Maurice Foster took over the reins for 1923, and it was almost the end for Taylor as a first-class player: after 1922 he played only one more first-class match\u2014though he captained Worcestershire in that game too\u2014against Oxford University in 1925. He made 1 and 0 and took 2-79 in the second innings.\nHe died in Birlingham, Worcestershire at the age of 73.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Taylor", "response": ["William Taylor may refer to:", "*William Taylor (Royal Navy officer) (1760\u20131842), British naval officer", "*William Taylor (Alamo defender) (fl. 1836), fatality at the Battle of the Alamo", "*William Taylor (Medal of Honor) (1836\u20131902), Union Army soldier and officer during the American Civil War", "*William Taylor (Royal Navy officer, born 1908) (William Horace Taylor, 1908\u20131999), British recipient of the George Cross", "*William Taylor (New South Wales politician) (1862\u20131922), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "*William Taylor (Tasmanian politician) (1894\u20131964), member of the Tasmanian Parliament", "*William Taylor (Victorian politician) (1818\u20131903), pastoralist and member of the Victorian Legislative Council", "*William Taylor (New Brunswick politician) (died 1834), businessman and political figure in New Brunswick", "*William Taylor (MP for Windsor) (fl. 1640), Member of Parliament (MP) for Windsor", "*William Taylor (MP for Leominster) (fl. 1797), MP for Leominster", "*Sir William Taylor, 1st Baronet (1902\u20131972), British Conservative Member of Parliament", "*William Taylor (preacher) (fl. 2014\u20132017), Anglican minister elected to the Common Council of the City of London Corporation", "*William Taylor (New York politician) (1791\u20131865), U.S. Congressman from New York", "*William Taylor (Virginia politician, born 1788) (1788\u20131846), congressman and lawyer from Virginia", "*William Taylor (Lollard) (died 1423), English Priest and theologian, burnt as a Lollard", "*William Taylor (Scottish minister) (1744\u20131823), Scottish Minister, Moderator and Principal", "*William Taylor (bishop) (1821\u20131902), U.S. Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church", "*William Taylor (Archdeacon of Liverpool) (died 1906), Archdeacon in the Diocese of Liverpool", "*William Taylor (Dean of Portsmouth) (born 1956), Anglican priest", "*William Taylor (inventor) (1865\u20131937), British inventor", "*William Taylor (ophthalmologist) (1912\u20131989), British ophthalmologist and expert on albinism", "*Bob Taylor (cricketer) (born 1941), Robert William Taylor, English cricketer", "*William Taylor (Derbyshire cricketer) (1885\u20131976), English cricketer", "*William Taylor (Worcestershire cricketer) (1885\u20131959), English cricketer", "*William Taylor (Surrey cricketer) (1821\u20131878), English cricketer", "*William Taylor (footballer, born 1886) (1886\u20131966), English footballer", "*William Taylor (jockey, born 1819), rode in 1846 Grand National", "*William Taylor (jockey, died 1950), rode in 1898 Grand National", "*William Taylor (cyclist) (1900\u2013?), Canadian Olympic cyclist", "*William Taylor (bookseller) (fl. 1708\u20131724), bookseller trading at St. Paul's Churchyard, London, and publisher of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe in 1719", "*William Taylor (historian) (1922\u20132014), U.S. historian, professor, and author", "*William Taylor (man of letters) (1765\u20131836), English scholar and linguist", "*William Taylor (writer) (1938\u20132015), New Zealand children's writer", "*William Taylor (lawyer) (fl. 1971\u20132005), British lawyer who was lead counsel for Abdelbaset al-Megrahi at the Lockerbie trial", "*William Taylor (police officer) (born 1947), British police officer", "*William Taylor (judge) (born 1944), English senior Circuit Judge", "*William Taylor (headmaster) (1840\u20131910), British teacher, headmaster of Sir Walter St John's Grammar School For Boys", "*William Taylor, video game designer, see Blazing Angels 2", "*William Taylor (folk song), a British folk song", "*William Taylor (cotton manufacturer) (died 1852), cotton manufacturer in Lancashire, England", "*William Taylor (academic) (1930\u20132005), English educationalist, vice-chancellor of the University of Hull", "*William Taylor (Master of Christ's College, Cambridge), academic", "*William Taylor House (disambiguation)", "*William Taylor (Nights: Journey of Dreams), character from video game Nights: Journey of Dreams"]}, {"page": "Maurice Jewell", "response": ["He married Elsie Taylor, sister of his Worcestershire teammate William Taylor, in 1911.
