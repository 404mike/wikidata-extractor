He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1872 and died in 1956. He was appointed manager of the Highland Railway's Lochgorm Works in 1903, and promoted to Assistant to the Chief Mechanical Engineer, Peter Drummond in 1903.\nAfter Drummond's departure for the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1911, Smith was appointed to replace him, albeit under the old title of Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent. His only design for the Highland Railway was the River Class, which was rejected by the Chief Engineer, causing his resignation. He went on to take a post in the Ministry of Munitions and in 1918 entered the steel industry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Highland Railway", "response": ["1912\u20131915 Fredrick George Smith"]}, {"page": "Fred Smith", "response": ["*Fredrick George Smith (1872\u20131956), British mechanical engineer"]}, {"page": "Locomotives of the Highland Railway", "response": ["Fredrick George Smith's brief tenure was cut short by a dispute over his sole design, the 'River' Class 4-6-0. Six locomotives were built, but they were (wrongly) considered to be too heavy for the Highland Railway, and were sold to the Caledonian Railway without being used."]}]}}
