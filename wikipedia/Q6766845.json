Mark Bretscher discovered the topological way proteins are arranged in the human erythrocyte membrane and its phospholipid asymmetry. Richard Henderson and Nigel Unwin developed electron crystallography to determine the structure of two-dimensional arrays, applying this to the bacterial purple protein, bacteriorhodopsin. Barbara Pearse discovered the major components of clathrin-coated vesicles, structures formed during endocytosis, and a low resolution structure of the cage-like lattice around them was determined. How proteins become localised to different parts of the cell \u2014 such as to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus or the plasma membrane \u2014 and the role of this in cell polarity, have been elucidated by Bretscher, Hugh Pelham  and Sean Munro. The spindle pole bodies \u2014 the large structures in yeast cells which act as the foci to which chromosomes are moved during mitosis \u2014 have been purified and a low resolution structure of them deduced by John Kilmartin.

They are responsible for aiding the movement of phospholipid molecules between the two leaflets that compose a cell's membrane (transverse diffusion, also known as a \"flip-flop\" transition). The possibility of active maintenance of an asymmetric distribution of molecules in the phospholipid bilayer was predicted in the early 1970s by Mark Bretscher. Although phospholipids diffuse rapidly in the plane of the membrane, their polar head groups cannot pass easily through the hydrophobic center of the bilayer, limiting their diffusion in this dimension. Some flippases - often instead called scramblases - are energy-independent and bidirectional, causing reversible equilibration of phospholipid between the two sides of the membrane, whereas others are energy-dependent and unidirectional, using energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump the phospholipid in a preferred direction. Flippases are described as transporters that move lipids from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic face, while floppases transport in the reverse direction."]}, {"page": "Joan A.

At the LMB, Steitz focused on the question of how bacteria know where to start the \"reading frame\" on mRNA. In the process, Steitz discovered the exact sequences on a mature RNA virus encoding three proteins where the virus mRNA binds bacterial ribosomes to produce proteins.  In 1969 she published a seminal paper in Nature showing the nucleotide sequence of the binding start points."]}, {"page": "Egon Bretscher", "response": ["Bretscher died in Switzerland in 1973.
