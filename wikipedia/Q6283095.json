He was also a painter in oils.\nHe was born in Birmingham in 1860 and educated at the Birmingham School of Art and in Antwerp under Charles Verlat. Following a tour of Europe and the Near East in the early 1880s, he settled in London in 1884.Of his paintings in oils, his works include The Proclamation of King Edward VII at St. James' Palace January 24, 1901 and On the Lookout, A Stormy Night.He was a member of the Society of Illustrators, the Royal Society of British Artists (from 1893) and Royal Institute (from 1898).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. E. Cule", "response": ["Sir Knight of the Splendid Way is an extensive reworking of his earlier book Sir Constant Knight of the Great King, published in 1899. Reviewing this, the Spectator said \"This is an allegorical tale, modelled, we may say, on the lines of the \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" the wayfarer in this case being a knight. He has a \"chart of the journey,\" as the pilgrim has his roll, meets the peril of temptation in the \"Palace of Sir Joyous,\" and finds it again in another shape in \"The Black Knight of Law.\" There is some imagination and some power of expression in Sir Constant, but the allegories that have achieved a real success are very few.\"The Spectator,  27 May, 1899, p.26Sir Knight of the Splendid Way tells of the knighting of Sir Constant in the Chapel of the Valley of Decision (his conversion) and the six \"adventures\" he undergoes on his way to the City of the King (eternal life), each testing his courage, fortitude and compassion for others.   Drawing for its inspiration on Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, the Arthurian tradition of the questing knight and the New Testament epistles, it is a spiritually profound and richly detailed work, written in a language suggestive of another era with some of the finest examples of word painting Cule ever achieved. W.Y. Fullerton wrote of Cule's allegory: \"For depth of experience and daintiness of touch, it may be placed alongside The Pilgrim's Progress itself without suffering by the comparison, and there can be no higher praise.\"W.

John was born in the third quarter of 1863GRO reference: District Birmingham (1837-1924) volume 6d page 169 at Birmingham, England. His father, William worked in the Birmingham pen trade and his elder brother was the artist Joseph Finnemore. John's mother, Charlotte died in 1878 when he was 15 years of age and his father did not marry again. The family must have been reasonably wealthy and as a result John received a good education because at the age of 17 he was already working as a school teacher. Five years later he married Eliza Emily Pearson who was the same age as him and was also a teacher at 17. Eliza came from a Northampton family which had resettled in Birmingham before she was 7 years of age. After her marriage Eliza dropped her first name and retained her maiden surname to become Emily Pearson Finnemore. She became an author of mainly religious works published by the Christian Knowledge Society (now known as SPCK).The on-line catalogue at the British Library lists 19 works. 11 were published by the Christian Society and one book, \"From a Welsh Hillside\" was written jointly with her husband John There were no children from the marriage."]}, {"page": "Charles Verlat", "response": ["In January 1886 the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh matriculated in painting and drawing at the Antwerp Academy. He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with Verlat, the then director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class Franz Vinck. Verlat organised for van Gogh to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by Eug\u00e8ne Siberdt. Soon Siberdt and van Gogh also came into conflict and there was a confrontation between the two men when van Gogh made a drawing after the Venus of Milo making her look like the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Van Gogh ceased to attend classes after the confrontation. On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that van Gogh was expelled from the Academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.Jan Lampo, In het Spoor van de Academie \u2013 persbericht   Verlat taught many other international pupils at the Academy including the illustrator Joseph Finnemore, Joseph Malachy Kavanagh and John Duncan.Robert Scholes, Finnemore, Joseph (1860-1939)Gallery of Original Art featuring Joseph Malachy Kavanagh"]}, {"page": "Finnemore", "response": ["* Joseph Finnemore (1860\u20131939), British book and magazine illustrator"]}, {"page": "List of Birmingham City University people", "response": ["*Joseph Finnemore"]}, {"page": "The Wide World Magazine", "response": ["Some famous names occasionally wrote for the magazine (such as Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry Morton Stanley, Douglas Reeman etc.), and it was copiously illustrated with photographs, as well as black and white drawings by such artists as Terence Cuneo, Cecil Stuart Tresilian, Alfred Pearse, Chas Sheldon, Paul Hardy, William Barnes Wollen, John L.
