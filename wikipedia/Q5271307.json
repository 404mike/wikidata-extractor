When Violet was 10, she met Vita (who was two years older) for the first time. After that, they attended the same school for several years and soon recognised a bond between them. When Violet was 14, she confessed her love to Vita and gave her a ring. In 1910, after the death of Edward VII, Mrs Keppel made her family observe a \"discretion\" leave of about two years before re-establishing themselves in British society. When they returned to London, the Keppels moved to a house in Grosvenor Street. At that time, Violet learned that Vita was soon to be engaged to Harold Nicolson and was involved in an affair with Rosamund Grosvenor. Violet made it clear that she still loved Vita, but became engaged to make Vita jealous. This did not stop Vita from marrying Harold (in October 1913), who was also bisexual. Vita and Harold maintained an open marriage."]}, {"page": "Constance Spry", "response": ["The biographer Diana Souhami revealed the painter Gluck had a romantic relationship with Spry, whose work informed the artist's admired floral paintings.Diane Souhami, Gluck, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988 In 2012 English Heritage marked Spry's tenure at 64 South Audley Street with a blue plaque."]}, {"page": "The Well of Loneliness", "response": ["Many of those familiar with the subculture she described, including her own friends, disagreed with her portrayal of it; Romaine Brooks called her \"a digger-up of worms with the pretension of a distinguished archaeologist\".Cline, 273\u2013274. Hall's correspondence shows that the negative view of bars like Alec's that she expressed in The Well was sincerely meant,Baker, Our Three Selves, 253\u2013254. but she also knew that such bars did not represent the only homosexual communities in Paris.Cline, 227, 273. It is a commonplace of criticism that her own experience of lesbian life was not as miserable as Stephen's.Love. Diana Souhami's comments on the subject are particularly sharp; she says Hall \"might have acknowledged the privilege, seductions, freedom, and fun that graced her daily life\" (173) and, in response to Hall's claim to be writing on behalf of some of the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world, remarks \"It is doubtful whether Radclyffe Hall and Una, Natalie Barney...and the rest, with their fine houses, stylish lovers, inherited incomes, sparkling careers and villas in the sun, were among the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world.\" (181\u201382) By focusing on misery and describing its cause as \"ceaseless persecution\" by \"the so-called just and righteous\", she intensified the urgency of her plea for change.Quotation from Hall, 388\u2013389.

One of Gluck's best-known paintings, Medallion, is a dual portrait of Gluck and Nesta Obermer, the painter's lover, inspired by a night in 1936 when they attended a Fritz Busch production of Mozart's Don Giovanni.  According to Gluck's biographer Diana Souhami, \"They sat together in the third row and felt the intensity of the music fused them both into one person and matched their love.\"  Gluck referred to it as the \"YouWe\" picture. It was later used as the cover of a 1982 Virago Press edition of The Well of Loneliness.
