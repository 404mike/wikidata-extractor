Born in West Bromwich, West Midlands, England, he has released fifteen albums, eight singles and four books since 1989. That year Paul did over a hundred performances in his first year on the road as a Singer/Songwriter. He tours in the UK and US, appearing at a variety of venues. His song \"Flaky People\" was played extensively by Mid-West American radio station WQRP in the late 1990s. The song talked about flaky leaders who fool around, which became poignant at the time of the Bill Clinton \u2013 Monica Lewinsky scandal.\nPoulton performs as a solo performer with an acoustic guitar and also with his band the Paul Poulton Project. He is noted as a skilled guitarist. He talks between songs about life, human idiosyncrasies, faith, God and philosophy. He is known as an apologist for Christianity in which his discourses are liberally seasoned with humour.A CrossRhythms Magazine review of \"Fallen People on a Fallen Planet\" said: \"Paul\u2019s great strength is that he crafts songs that say more in a stanza than most songsmiths can manage in an album\".Music critic Peter Dilley wrote for Christian Music magazine, saying:\n\n \". . . a skilled lyricist. . .he examines human waywardness \u2013 offering hope . . . after exploding secular values with devastating effect. \" \n\nPhantom Tollbooth said:  \" It\u2019s like Dante and Bunyan in guitar-funk form. \".A sample of Poulton's music may be found on Spotify and other music sites - \"Paul Poulton\" or \"Paul Poulton Project\".\nA book written by Poulton called Genesis for Ordinary People was published in November 2014. The book is subtitled \"Unwrapping the First Book of the Bible\" and follows the storyline of Genesis from the viewpoint of a modern person who is interested in the subject. Reviewer Robin Thompson writing in Never For Nothing said, \"Paul... using a mix of apologetics, hermeneutics and a knack for communicating complex ideas in an accessible way, manages to cut through some of the misinformation and, dare I say, misinterpretation, the latter of which has not been confined to secular circles.\" A web site has been set up where Poulton has answered a few questions raised by the book. A follow-up book entitled \"Exodus for Ordinary People\" has been published in August 2016. The American publishers Wipf and Stock are publishers of all Poulton's books including the 2018 book \"God and Primordial People\" and \"Fishing for Praise\" published in 2008Poulton has written for a number of sites and magazines including Cross Rhythms, the online edition of The Baptist Times, British Runner magazine and HeartBeat The Magazine", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of singer-songwriters", "response": ["*Paul Poulton"]}, {"page": "Mary's Boy Child", "response": ["Additional covers include a version by the Australian pop group Hi-5, released in 1998, a version by its American counterpart, released in 2005 but recorded in 2004, The Wiggles on their 2004 album Santa's Rockin'; Juice Newton's folk-rock version on her 2007 The Gift of Christmas; Mandisa on her 2008 album It's Christmas; Paul Poulton's reggae version on his 2008 album Grooves 4 Scrooge; Daniel O'Donnell on his 2010 album O Holy Night; and Joe McElderry on his 2011 album Classic Christmas."]}, {"page": "Cross Rhythms", "response": ["As well as operating Cross Rhythms City Radio and the Cross Rhythms website, which has a review section of Christian music releases, and life-based articles by a selection of writers including Mal Fletcher and Paul Poulton, Cross Rhythms also provides syndicated radio programming for a number of other radio stations, mostly community based, and music review content for several publications including the UK Christian retail trade magazine Christian Marketplace."]}, {"page": "Son of man (Christianity)", "response": ["In the last part of the 20th century, the messianic view was highly criticized and the concept of idiomatic use began to gain support among some scholars. In the 21st century, a simple approach has been made: \"Adam means 'man.' So when Christ is called the Son of Man the entire generating line all the way from Adam down to Jesus is being recalled.\"Genesis for Ordinary People, Second Edition by Paul Poulton 2017  page 35 However, no consensus has emerged among scholars on how the expression can be interpreted. Another view put forward by Bart D. Ehrman (1999) is that there are some passages (as such Mark 8:38, 13:26, 14:62; Matthew 19:28, 25:31\u201346; and Luke 12:8\u20139) in which Jesus mentions 'the Son of Man' and does not appear to be talking about himself, but about someone else, namely a cosmic judge who would come down from heaven to bring judgement. The identification of the Son of Man with Jesus might thus be a later, inauthentic tradition. Ingolfsland (2001) argued that Ehrman's examples were not valid, or did not meet his own criteria."]}, {"page": "Dissident Prophet", "response": ["In 2013, tracks from Weapons of Mass Deception appeared with Andrew Marston on BBC Hereford & Worcester; received airplay on various Cross Rhythms Radio stations; major rotation on WeAre1Radio  an online radio rock station, serving Latin America based in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.
