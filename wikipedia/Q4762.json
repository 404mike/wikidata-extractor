Further endorsements from directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie led to the film being critically re-evaluated, with its depiction of class structure and life in 1970s Britain and Roy Budd's minimalist jazz score receiving considerable praise. In 1999, Get Carter was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in Total Film magazine chose it as the greatest British film. A poorly-received remake under the same title was released in 2000, with Sylvester Stallone portraying Jack Carter and Caine in a supporting role.", "The majority of the film's music was composed by Roy Budd, a jazz pianist and composer, who had previously worked on soundtracks for Soldier Blue and Flight of the Doves. Aside from its score, Budd also composed three songs: \"Looking For Someone\", \"Love Is A Four Letter Word\" (with lyrics by Jack Fishman) and \"Hallucinations\". The theme (otherwise known as \"Carter Takes a Train\"), the best-known piece from the film, was played by Budd and the other members of his jazz trio, Jeff Clyne (double bass) and Chris Karan (percussion), and was recorded on a budget of \u00a3450. The musicians recorded the soundtrack live, direct to picture, playing along with the film. To save time and money Budd did not use overdubs, simultaneously playing a real harpsichord, a Wurlitzer electric piano and a grand piano.Get Carter DVD, Warner Archive, 2000 Budd described the experience as \"uncomfortable, but it sounded pleasant\". The theme tune features the sounds of the character's train journey from London to Newcastle.", "Warner Bros. reissued the film in a special edition on DVD in October 2000 in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Extras included three trailers; the international trailer, an introduction by Michael Caine to the people of Newcastle, and a third featuring Roy Budd playing the opening theme. This format was also used in a 2001 VHS set released by Warner, which included Bullit and Shaft. Also included on the DVD was commentary from Caine, Hodges and Suschitzky, constructed from separate interviews with the three. The soundtrack was presented in 1.0 mono Dolby Digital.", "The film's music also enjoyed its own resurgence in popularity, as it tapped into a 1990s interest in vintage film soundtracks. Portishead's Adrian Utley explained that they found the music to Get Carter inspiring as \"it was done quickly and cheaply with only a few instruments, and it had to be intensely creative to disguise its limitations\". The Human League album Dare contains a track covering the Get Carter theme, although it was only a version of the sparse leitmotif that opens and closes the film as opposed to the full-blooded jazz piece that accompanies the train journey. Stereolab also covers Roy Budd's theme on their album Aluminum Tunes, although they call their version \"Get Carter\", as opposed to its proper title, \"Main Theme (Carter Takes A Train)\". This Stereolab version was subsequently used as a sample in the song \"Got Carter\" by 76. The Finnish rock band Laika & the Cosmonauts cover the film's theme on their 1995 album The Amazing Colossal Band. BB Davis & the Red Orchidstra released a version of the film's title theme in 1999. Jah Wobble produced a dub cover version of the theme tune in 2009. Wobble had long been a fan of the bassline of the track, saying in a 2004 interview with The Independent that \"There are some bass lines that contain the whole mystery of creation within them\".", "Category:Films scored by Roy Budd"]}, {"page": "Diamonds (1975 film)", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Roy Budd"]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Roy Budd (1947\u20131993)Get Carter, Zeppelin, The Carey Treatment, The Sea Wolves, Who Dares Wins"]}, {"page": "The Sandbaggers", "response": ["The title theme music, composed by jazz pianist Roy Budd, establishes its rhythmic undertone with the cimbalom, an instrument often associated with spy thrillers (John Barry, for example, used the cimbalom in his scores for The Ipcress File and The Quiller Memorandum).
