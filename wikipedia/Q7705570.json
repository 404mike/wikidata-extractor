She is currently studying for a PhD in Biological Anthropology at the University of Kent.She ran as the Labour candidate for the European Parliament seat of the Cotswolds in 1994, but lost to the long-serving Conservative incumbent MEP, Lord Henry Plumb, however she succeeded in cutting Plumb's majority from 45,678 in 1989 to just 4,268 at that election.\nKingham was elected as MP for Gloucester in 1997, but retired from Parliament in disillusionment after just one term, having complained publicly about the antiquated ways of working in the Palace of Westminster. She later expressed dissatisfaction with the old boys network in the House of Commons, accusing various members of \"endlessly thrusting their groins around the Chamber in mock combat\" and \"indulging in yah-boo nonsense, point-scoring and silly games\". Whilst in Parliament, Kingham successfully campaigned to change laws to protect firefighters and to get a nationwide cystic fibrosis screening programme for newborn babies. She was a Member of the International Development Select Committee.\nKingham is married to Mark Luetchford, a civil servant, trustee of War on Want and author of \"Waging the War on Want\", the official history of the organisation.
