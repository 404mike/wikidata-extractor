In 1905, Baron Franz Nopcsa dedicated a study to Hypsilophodon,Nopcsa, F., 1905, \"Notes on British dinosaurs. Part I. Hypsilophodon\", Geological Magazine, London, (5) 2: 203-208 and in 1936 William Elgin Swinton did the same,Swinton, W.E., 1936, \"Notes on the osteology of Hypsilophodon, and on the family Hypsilophodontidae\", Zoological Society of London, Proceedings, 1936: 555-578 on the occasion of the mounting of two restored skeletons in the British Museum of Natural History.Swinton, W.E., 1936, \"A new exhibit of Hypsilophodon\", Natural History Magazine, London, 5: 331-336 Most known Hypsilophodon specimens were discovered between 1849 and 1921 and are in the possession of the Natural History Museum that acquired the collections of Mantell, Fox, Hulke and Hooley. These represent about twenty individual animals. Apart from the holotype and paratype, the most significant specimens are: NHM R5829, the skeleton of a large animal; NHM R5830 and NHM R196/196a, both skeletons of juvenile animals; and NHM R2477, a block with a skull together with two separate vertebral columns. Although this was the largest find, new ones continue to be made."]}, {"page": "Scelidosaurus", "response": ["Scelidosaurus was an ornithischian. It was the oldest ornithischian known until the description of Geranosaurus in 1911. During the twentieth century, it has been classified at different times as an ankylosaur or stegosaur. Alfred von Zittel (1902), William Elgin Swinton (1934), and Robert Appleby et al. (1967) identified the genus as a stegosaurian,Thulborn, R.A. (1977) Relationships of the lower Jurassic dinosaur Scelidosaurus harrisonii. Journal of Paleontology. July 1977; v. 51; no. 4; p. 725-739 though this concept then encompassed all armoured forms. In a 1968 paper, Romer argued it was an ankylosaur. In 1977, Richard Thulborn of the University of Queensland attempted to reclassify Scelidosaurus as an ornithopod similar to Tenontosaurus or Iguanodon. Thulborn argued Scelidosaurus was a lightly built bipedal dinosaur adapted for running. Thulborn's 1977 theories on the genus have since been rejected."]}, {"page": "Nuthetes", "response": ["Nuthetes was originally classified by Owen as a lizard and a varanid; later he changed his mind concluding it was a crocodilian. Only in 1888 Richard Lydekker did understand it was a dinosaur. In 1934 William Elgin Swinton thought it was a juvenile member of the Megalosauridae. In 1970 Rodney Steel even renamed the species Megalosaurus destructor. In 2002 however, a re-examination of the fossils by paleontologist Angela Milner showed that they most likely belonged to a subadult dromaeosaurid. Steve Sweetman examined five good specimens of fossil teeth and confirmed that they belong to Nuthetes destructor, and concluded that this species is a velociraptorine dromaeosaurid. If this placement is correct, it would have been one of the oldest dromaeosaurids known, the first to be described, and the first known from Britain. However, Rauhut, Milner and Moore-Fay (2010) pointed out the great similarity of the teeth of basal tyrannosauroid Proceratosaurus to the teeth of velociraptorine dromaeosaurids. The authors recommended caution when referring to isolated teeth from the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous to the Dromaeosauridae (explicitly citing Milner's 2002 study and Sweetman's 2004 study as examples of studies that identified isolated theropod teeth as belonging to dromaeosaurids), as these teeth might belong to proceratosaurid tyrannosauroids instead."]}, {"page": "Clevosaurus", "response": ["The first species of Clevosaurus to be described was C. hudsoni, which was described by William Elgin Swinton in 1939 from a fissure fill deposit in Cromhall Quarry (Magnesian Conglomerate Formation) in the county of Gloucestershire, England, with the name of the county lending its name to the genus.W.
