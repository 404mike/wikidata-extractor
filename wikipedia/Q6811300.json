It seemed to be over when he abandoned Alma to marry wealthy widow Jackie Ingram (Shirin Taylor), who inherited a factory from her late husband, Peter (who had died of a heart attack during an argument with Mike). Jackie soon saw through him and their marriage lasted one week. Jackie threatened Mike with a shotgun if he did not get out of her sight. A couple of years later, after Alma's relationship with Ken failed because of her feelings for Mike, Mike and Alma finally married. Mike once again had his own business, the underwear factory Underworld. In 1999, Mike was seduced by Julia Stone, who blackmailed him for large sums of cash. When Alma discovered this, she left Mike; once they had divorced, she reverted to her maiden name of Halliwell. Unable to win Alma back, Mike settled with loud-mouthed machinist Linda Sykes (Jacqueline Pirie), who was interested only in his money. His long-lost son, Mark Redman (Paul Fox), came to Weatherfield, and Mike took him on at the factory as manager. However, on his wedding night, Mike found out that Mark and Linda had been having an affair. At first, he blamed Mark but he soon enraged Linda by choosing to spend time with Alma, who was dying of cervical cancer. At this point, he realised that marrying Linda was a mistake. Following Alma's death, he ended the marriage and Linda slept with Mike's new business associate in revenge. She also caused a stir at Fred Elliott's (John Savident) wedding to her mother, Eve Sykes (Melanie Kilburn), and the pressure built on Mike as Mark returned for the celebration. Mike was seen arguing with Linda, who mysteriously disappeared.

However, it transpired that Eve had never divorced her first husband, Ray, leaving Fred alone again. In 2004 Fred fell out with his friend Mike Baldwin when he had an affair with his girlfriend Penny King. Fred was further embittered towards Mike when he introduced him to Stacy Hilton who conned him by playing on his feelings. During a game of poker Mike used Fred's feelings against him and exploited the no limit rule to win his butcher's shop. When Mike let  Fred  keep the business the men were finally reconciled. In 2006, after a brief courtship, Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) accepted a proposal from Fred and planned to marry in October.
