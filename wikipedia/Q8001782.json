Not many. And a lot of the deals the Dragons make will be based on loans or are equity-based, which is the worst kind of finance you can get for a start-up, there are hundreds of people out there you can get advice from - do not go to a Dragon. I know what it's like to build a successful business: hard graft gets you there, not appearing on a TV show. People would be much better off speaking to their bank manager.\"He also added \"The Dragons are interested only in a good deal that benefits them, and their justification in being that ruthless is because a lot of the deals go wrong. Like everyone, I thought the show was quite novel when it first came out, but Dragons' Den is a programme that has had its time.\""]}, {"page": "Wilfred Emmanuel Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones"]}, {"page": "Black Farmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones "]}, {"page": "Conservative A-List", "response": ["*Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, Entrepreneur of the Year \u2014 the Black Enterprise Awards 2005, PPC Chippenham 2010"]}, {"page": "Carpool (web series)", "response": ["| Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Oliver Dowden, Thangam Debbonaire, Wanda Wyporska, Robin Shattock, Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones"]}]}}
