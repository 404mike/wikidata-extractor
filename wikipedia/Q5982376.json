Manager Jackie Gibbons left the club at the start of the 1952\u201353 season and was succeeded by his assistant Jimmy Bain, who proved ill-suited to management, and so in January 1953 Lawton was appointed as player-manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and the strains of management were having a negative impact on his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of 104. They got off to a poor start to the 1953\u201354 season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line by singing Dear Old Pals."]}, {"page": "Freddie Cox", "response": ["Despite his cup exploits, Cox was never an ever-present in the Arsenal side; he first faced competition from Ian McPherson for the right-wing spot, and then from the talented youngster Arthur Milton. After only appearing in nine matches in the 1952\u201353 season, in which Arsenal won the First Division title, he sought pastures new and was transferred to West Bromwich Albion as player-coach. In all he played 94 matches for Arsenal in League and Cup, scoring 16 goals."]}, {"page": "Willi Steffen", "response": ["Steffen was a cultured and dedicated full back, tall and pacy, who quickly became a crowd favourite at Chelsea, while his blonde hair and good looks also won him admirers. He made his debut in a 3\u20131 loss against Derby County and played 20 league and cup games for Chelsea during the 1946-47 season, including a memorable FA Cup win over Arsenal at Highbury, during which he expertly marked winger Ian McPherson. Steffen returned to Switzerland at the end of the season to finish his national service and was made club captain in his final game for Chelsea, also against Derby."]}, {"page": "Thomas Vallance", "response": ["Vallance was born in Stoke-on-Trent, and was the son of Jimmy Vallance, the trainer at Stoke City. Vallance began his career at Stoke City during the Second World War. He moved to Torquay United in 1945, playing in the FA Cup First Round, second leg tie which Torquay drew away to Newport County to lose 2\u20131 on aggregate in November 1945 . He left Torquay before playing a league game and subsequently joined Arsenal in 1947. Mainly a reserve, he finally made his league debut on 4 September 1948 in a 1\u20131 draw against Sheffield United after Arsenal's regular left-winger, Denis Compton had been injured. He shared the left wing position with Ian McPherson that season, playing 14 times and scoring twice, but played just once the following season as McPherson and Compton monopolised the left wing position. After several more seasons in Arsenal's reserves, he left the club on a free transfer in 1953."]}, {"page": "Ian MacPherson", "response": ["*Ian McPherson (1920\u20131983), Scottish footballer", "*Ian McPherson (police officer) (born 1961), British police officer"]}, {"page": "1939\u201340 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Ian McPherson"]}, {"page": "List of Arsenal F.C. managers", "response": ["Allison resigned in 1947, a year after professional football resumed, and his position was taken over by Tom Whittaker, the club's first-team trainer.

The club's success began to wane after this, which in turn commenced a stressful period for Whittaker. In October 1956 he died of a heart attack, aged 58.
