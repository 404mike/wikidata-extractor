In their letter, they called on the Pope to ensure the Fifteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops worked towards undoing the damage Church teaching has done to young LGBT people, saying that the Synod offered the Church a \"unique moment\" to consider the impact that negative attitudes towards LGBT people \u2013 including some espoused by the Church \u2013 have had on children. Citing the problems that arise when children are caused to believe their sexuality will disappoint their parents, the MPs warned of \"the role of the Church\u2019s current teaching in their being given that sense\". The Church, they said, ought to be at the fore of efforts to protect young LGBT people from \"negative or ambivalent attitudes\", and described the Synod as \"a once-in-a-generation moment where we can all create positive change to young peoples' lives.\""]}]}}
