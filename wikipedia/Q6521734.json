When they finally returned to Alliance action, at home to Bootle, they were again without Jenkyns, who was making his third appearance of the 1892 British Home Championship in a 6\u20131 defeat to Scotland. William Kendrick took his place, and reserve-team colleague Len Curryer replaced Morris at centre forward. Bootle had the better of the early game, and took the lead, but Heath came back with two goals from Wheldon, who also had a penalty saved, and two from Walton; Bootle were reduced to ten men for the second half through injury to one of their half-backs.Saturday's Football.
