They were humiliated 10\u20130 in the second match of the season away at Preston North End where all the goals were scored by Scottish internationals as Stoke suffered their worst league defeat. Stoke also lost 8\u20130 away to both Everton and Blackburn Rovers and they also suffered a 6\u20131 reverse against Aston Villa. Stoke were awful throughout the season and went on a ten match losing streak stretching from 19 October 1889 to 4 January 1890. In a tough home fixture against Burnley just before Christmas, Bob McCormick, the Stoke inside-right, badly injured his collar bone in a challenge with the Burnley full-back and at the end of the match some supporters invaded the pitch and confronted the \"Clarets\" defender. Stoke won the match 2\u20131 but Burnley lodged an appeal claiming their players had been intimidated. The League decided in Burnley's favour and ordered the match to be replayed, this time Burnley won 4\u20133.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bob McCormick"]}, {"page": "1885\u201386 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Bob McCormick, James McCall, David Allan, William Harrower"]}]}}
