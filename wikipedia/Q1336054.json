Three of the eight deaths on Everest that day were on the North Face. He was climbing further up Everest when he came across the famous 'Green Boots' he was confused why someone would have fallen asleep on the north face of Everest but it was soon to occur to him that this body was no longer alive.

Gaining the support of his network of climbing friends, he was able to develop Mountain Craft into a flourishing magazine which he then bought, changed its name to Mountain and then fostered, wrote for and edited from 1969 to 1978. It distinctly reflected the culture of the climbing and mountaineering community of the time. The magazine had high journalistic standards, exemplified by its coverage of the Cairngorm Plateau disaster in 1971. Alan Hinkes considered it \"perhaps the finest mountain magazine ever published\"."]}]}}
