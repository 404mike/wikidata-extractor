It was first used by Sir William Huggins and his wife Margaret Lindsay Huggins, in 1876, in their work to record the spectra of astronomical objects. In 1880 Henry Draper used the new dry plate process with photographically corrected  refracting telescope made by Alvan Clarkloen.ucolick.org, Lick Observatory 12 inch Telescope to make a 51-minute exposure of the Orion Nebula, the first photograph of a nebula ever made. A breakthrough in astronomical photography came in 1883, when amateur astronomer Andrew Ainslie Common used the dry plate process to record several images of the same nebula in exposures up to 60 minutes with a  reflecting telescope that he constructed in the backyard of his home in Ealing, outside London.

Silvered glass mirrors were a vast improvement, since silver reflects 90% of the light that hits it and is much slower to tarnish than speculum. Silver coatings can also be removed from the glass, so a tarnished mirror could be resilvered without changing the delicate precision-polished shape of the glass substrate. Glass is also more thermally stable than speculum metal, allowing it to hold its shape better through temperature changes. This marked the end of the speculum-mirror reflecting telescope, with the last large one, the Great Melbourne Telescope with its 122\u00a0cm (48-inch) mirror, being completed in 1867. The era of the large glass-mirror reflector had begun, with telescopes such as Andrew Ainslie Common's 1879 36-inch (91\u00a0cm) and 1887 60-inch (152\u00a0cm) reflectors built at Ealing, and the first of the \"modern\" large glass-mirror research reflectors, 60-inch (150\u00a0cm) Mount Wilson Observatory Hale telescope of 1908, the 100-inch (2.5 m) Mount Wilson Hooker telescope in 1917 and the 200-inch (5\u00a0m) Mount Palomar Hale telescope in 1948."]}, {"page": "Boyden Observatory", "response": ["Andrew Ainslie Common figured a mirror in 1885 (and another in 1890) for a  Newtonian reflecting telescope (later converted to a Cassegrain), but the telescope fell into disuse and was bought by the Harvard College Observatory from Common's estate.
