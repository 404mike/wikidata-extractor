They, along with Hyacinth's senile father, frequently turn up inconveniently (usually in their clapped-out Ford Cortina Mk IV \u2013 which always makes a characteristic backfire when it arrives), with Hyacinth going to great lengths to avoid them (saying: \"Richard, you know I love my family, but that's no reason why I should have to acknowledge them in broad daylight!\"). Rose is very sexually aggressive and promiscuous, adding to Hyacinth's embarrassment.", "Hyacinth's senile father frequently has flashbacks to the Second World War, and often exhibits bizarre behaviour, sometimes involving embarrassing situations with women (Onslow describes him as \"barmy\"). Two relatives of whom Hyacinth is not ashamed are her wealthy sister Violet (Anna Dawson) and her unseen son Sheridan. Violet frequently telephones Hyacinth for advice, allowing her to loudly announce to anyone in earshot, \"It's my sister Violet\u00a0\u2013 the one with a Mercedes, swimming pool/sauna and room for a pony\". However, Violet's social acceptability is damaged by the eccentric behaviour of her cross-dressing, equestrian-loving turf accountant husband Bruce, whom she violently attacks because of his behaviour.", "| Onslow || data-sort-value=\"Hughes, Geoffrey\" | Geoffrey Hughes ||  ||  ||  ||  || ", "In 1997, BBC America produced a one-off, one hour TV special. It was a retrospective clipshow starring the characters of Daisy and Onslow \u2014 who were shown looking through Hyacinth's diary which had become mixed up with some photographs she had given to them. The special replayed clips from previous episodes and aired on the BBC.", "===Life Lessons from Onslow (2008)===", "In 2008, a further clipshow special was broadcast by PBS; this time only starring the character of Onslow who passed on \"lessons for life\" from within the framing device of a spoof Open University programme. This was the only episode not written or directed by Roy Clarke and Harold Snoad. This special was written by Michelle Street and directed by Duane Huey. Both specials have subsequently been issued on DVD.", "Exterior shots around Daisy's and Onslow's council terrace were taken in the Stoke Aldermoor district of  Coventry. Other exterior street and town shots were filmed in Leamington Spa and in various towns in Warwickshire, along with many scenes from the large town of Northampton, mainly the church hall. Some scenes were also shot in Swindon, Lydiard Park, Oxford, and Bristol. One scene was shot in Oslo, Norway. One episode was filmed in Great Yarmouth, mainly in the Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach Theme Park.", "Onslow drives a 1978 Ford Cortina (number plate VSD 389S) that is in poor condition and backfires loudly almost every time it starts or stops, embarrassing Hyacinth, and frequently crushing her hopes of creating a perfect impression with new people. (The DVLA website shows that this vehicle's tax was not renewed once the series finished, suggesting that it was scrapped at that point). Onslow is also the owner of the rusting carcass of a Hillman Avenger in his front garden, in which lives Onslow's dog that always barks at Hyacinth as she approaches.", "In March 1997, Geoffrey Hughes and Judy Cornwell reprised their roles as Onslow and Daisy for a special compilation episode recorded for broadcast in the United States on PBS. The show sees the pair introduce classic clips from the series.", "* Life Lessons from Onslow", "In early 2008, Geoffrey Hughes reprised his role as Onslow once again for a clipshow of the series; this was for broadcast on American television, and sees him teaching a credit course at the Open University, and has selected \"successful relationships\" as his subject matter. The special was also released on Region 1 DVD.", "When Keeping Up Appearances did not return, after Patricia Routledge announced that she no longer wished to play Hyacinth, Roy Clarke's proposed spin-off series was called Mind Your Manors. The series was referenced in BBC in-house literature during 1997 and 1998, and later described by both Clarke and Geoffrey Hughes as part of a discussion of the character of Onslow in Radio 4's Archive on 4: On Northern Men, broadcast in 2009.", "The spin-off would have seen Onslow forced to take a supposedly \"easy\" job tending the gardens of a large manor house estate owned by a doddery and rather forgetful old Lord. When the Lord passes away suddenly, Onslow, Daisy and Rose (who it is implied was having a fling with the Lord, causing the heart attack which led to his passing) end up 'temporarily' moving into the manor house to mind it, due to a legal dispute with the deceased Lord's estranged brother (whom Rose immediately starts lusting after), who wants the land. ", "A mislaid deeds paper left by the forgetful old Lord would supposedly clarify who has rights to the estate, buried somewhere in the gardens that Onslow is left to ineptly try and keep in shape. Most of the conflict would have come from the Lord's brother and the manor's snooty neighbours, the wealthy Hyde-Whytes, who are not happy about the \"commoners\" who have taken up residence next door (although it later transpires that Mr. Hyde-Whyte used to know Onslow in their youth and is indebted to him after Onslow once took the fall for him to stop him being arrested). Su Pollard was approached to play the role of Miss Dorothy \"Dotty\" Henshaw, the Lord's eccentric and easily flustered cook / house-keeper who remains with the estate, and some preliminary location shooting was reportedly undertaken, though this may be connected with the \"missing\" final episode of Series 5, \"The Bishop Affair\". This proposed follow-up series was ultimately not commissioned, with Hughes continuing with his portrayal as Onslow in the specials listed above instead.", "* The Full Bouquet: Special Edition \u2013 released 9 September 2008 (complete series re-release, everything from volumes 1\u20138 & special \"Life Lessons from Onslow\")", "* Life Lessons from Onslow \u2013 released 9 September 2008", "* Life Lessons from Onslow \u2013 released 15 April 2010", "In 2010, the television show was adapted into a play entitled Keeping Up Appearances that toured theatres in the UK.
