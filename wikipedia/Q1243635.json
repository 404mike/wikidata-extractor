It continued to perform and grow in numbers and stature, so that in 1945 it was in a position to appoint Antal Dor\u00e1ti as music director. Under Dor\u00e1ti, the orchestra became fully professional. Several times during the history of the orchestra it has suspended operations, including periods during the First and Second World Wars from 1914 to 1918 and from 1942 to 1945, and more recently in 1974 due to fiscal restraints. Subsequent music directors have included Georg Solti, Anshel Brusilow, and Eduardo Mata. Andrew Litton was music director from 1994 to 2006.  During Litton's tenure, the orchestra recorded the four Rachmaninoff piano concerti and the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini with Stephen Hough for Hyperion Records."]}, {"page": "1961 in music", "response": ["*November 22 \u2013 Stephen Hough, pianist"]}, {"page": "Mass (music)", "response": ["* Mass of Innocence and Experience for SATB and organ (2006) by Stephen Hough", "* Missa Mirabilis SATB and organ or orchestra (2007) by Stephen Hough"]}, {"page": "Partita", "response": ["* Stephen Hough: Partita for piano (2019)"]}]}}
