That he might have made the grade at a higher level of cricket is suggested by the fact that, in the 1922 and 1923 seasons, he figured in late-season festival cricket at Eastbourne and Hastings, playing for South v North, for the Royal Air Force (Ex-Service) side against the Rest of England, and for The Rest against Lord Cowdray's XI, alongside notable cricketing names such as Jack Hobbs, Frank Woolley, Percy Fender and the Gilligans.He was awarded the OBE.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Stanley Amor (1908\u20131930) 26 matches CA"]}]}}
