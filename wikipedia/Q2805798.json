Croft was very worried that soon others would be starting work on similar projects so he wished to rush it past the BBC as soon as possible, Croft later said that 'It speaks volumes about the flexibility of the BBC at that time ... we rushed it along without any opposition at all. One of my concerns, when I spoke to [Head of Comedy] Jimmy Gilbert, was that everyone would soon be trying to do something similar in this area, because \"space\" was suddenly all the rage, so I was greatly bothered about the danger of duplication. So I told him that Jeremy and I had an idea that we really liked, and that we wanted to do a pilot, but that the idea was so \"hot\" that I'd prefer not to tell him what it was about. And Jimmy, to his eternal credit, didn't ask for a script, he didn't question it at all, he just told me to go ahead and do it.'"]}, {"page": "Which Way to the War", "response": ["Which Way to the War is a failed pilot for a planned British television sitcom, which was written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd.
