Some Danish/Dano-Norwegian countships were associated with fiefs, and these counts were known as \"feudal counts\" (lensgreve). They rank above ordinary (titular) counts, and their position in the Danish aristocracy as the highest-ranking noblemen is broadly comparable to that of dukes in other European countries.Ferdinand Christian Herman von Krogh: Den h\u00f8iere danske Adel. En genealogisk Haandbog, C. Steen & s\u00f8n, 1866 With the first free Constitution of Denmark of 1849 came a complete abolition of the privileges of the nobility. Since then the title of count has been granted only to members of the Danish royal family, either as a replacement for a princely title when marrying a commoner, or in recent times, instead of that title in connection with divorce. Thus the first wife of Prince Joachim of Denmark, the younger son of Margrethe II of Denmark, became Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg on their divorce - initially retaining her title of princess, but losing it on her remarriage."]}, {"page": "Excellency", "response": ["Also, former members of a royal house or family, who did have a royal title but forfeited it, may be awarded the style afterwards.
