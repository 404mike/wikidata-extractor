Pearson's batting and bowling styles are unknown. He was born at Worksop, Nottinghamshire.\nPearson made a single first-class appearance for Nottinghamshire against Surrey at The Oval in 1883. Surrey won the toss and elected to bat, making 236 all out in their first-innings. Pearson bowled 3.1 overs toward the end of the innings, taking the wickets of William Roller, Frederick Johnson, and Ted Barratt, conceding just one run off his bowling. Nottinghamshire responded to Surrey's total by posting 405 all out in their first-innings, with Pearson being dismissed for a single run by Barratt. Surrey reached 112/3 in their second-innings, at which point the match was declared a draw. This was his only major appearance for Nottinghamshire.\nHe died at Boughton, Nottinghamshire, on 18 January 1892.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Pearson", "response": ["Joseph Pearson may refer to:", "* Joseph Pearson (politician) (1776\u20131834), Congressional Representative from North Carolina", "* Joseph Pearson (zoologist) (1881\u20131971), British-born zoologist and marine biologist", "* Joseph Pearson (footballer) (1868\u2013?), English footballer", "* Joseph Pearson (cricketer) (1860\u20131892), English cricketer", "* Joseph Pearson (writer) (born 1975), Canadian essayist, cultural historian, and journalist"]}]}}
