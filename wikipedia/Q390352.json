It was an influential early work of operational research. John Rennie the Younger in addressing the Institution of Civil Engineers on manufacturing in 1846 mentioned mostly surveys in encyclopaedias, and Babbage's book was first an article in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana, the form in which Rennie noted it, in the company of related works by John Farey, Jr., Peter Barlow and Andrew Ure. From An essay on the general principles which regulate the application of machinery to manufactures and the mechanical arts (1827), which became the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana article of 1829, Babbage developed the schematic classification of machines that, combined with discussion of factories, made up the first part of the book. The second part considered the \"domestic and political economy\" of manufactures."]}, {"page": "Electrical telegraph", "response": ["Hans Christian \u00d8rsted discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year Johann Schweigger invented the galvanometer, with a coil of wire around a compass, that could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.M. (10 December 2014).

Retrieved 7 February 2018, from https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier Also that year, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re suggested that telegraphy could be achieved by placing small magnets under the ends of a set of wires, one pair of wires for each letter of the alphabet. He was apparently unaware of Schweigger's invention at the time, which would have made his system much more sensitive. In 1825, Peter Barlow tried Amp\u00e8re's idea but only got it to work over  and declared it impractical. In 1830 William Ritchie improved on Amp\u00e8re's design by placing the magnetic needles inside a coil of wire connected to each pair of conductors. He successfully demonstrated it, showing the feasibility of the electromagnetic telegraph, but only within a lecture hall.Fahie, pp. 302\u2013306"]}, {"page": "March 1", "response": ["*1862 \u2013 Peter Barlow, English mathematician and physicist (b. 1776)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of electromagnetism and classical optics", "response": ["* 1820 \u2013 Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re, professor of mathematics at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, demonstrates that parallel current-carrying wires experience magnetic force in a meeting of the French Academy of Science, exactly one week after \u00d8rsted's announcement of his discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current. He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops Amp\u00e8re's law describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the galvanometer. In 1821, he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per \"galvanometer\" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in 1824, Peter Barlow reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical. In 1826 he publishes the Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831, Amp\u00e8re agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery."]}, {"page": "Telephoto lens", "response": ["The concept of the telephoto lens, in reflecting form, was first described by Johannes Kepler in his Dioptrice of 1611, and re-invented by Peter Barlow in 1834."]}, {"page": "List of geophysicists", "response": ["* Peter Barlow (English, 1776\u20131862) \u2013 experimental and observational studies of terrestrial magnetism, Copley Medal"]}, {"page": "Peter W.
