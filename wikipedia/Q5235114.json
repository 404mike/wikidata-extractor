During his playing career, Holt made more than 300 appearances in the Scottish Football League for Queen's Park, Heart of Midlothian and Partick Thistle between 1957 and 1970.\nAt Hearts (who were reigning Scottish champions at the time he joined the club), Holt won the 1962\u201363 Scottish League Cup during his nine-year spell at Tynecastle Park and was an important member of the team which only missed out on the 1964\u201365 Scottish Division One title on goal average. However, he was released on a free transfer in 1969 and later stated he felt he had been badly treated by the club.Holt, who earned five caps for Scottish national side, also represented Great Britain at the 1960 Summer Olympics (being able to do so as he played for Queen's Park who operated on an amateur basis).He later worked as a taxi driver for many years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heart of Midlothian F.C.", "response": ["The 1960s saw Hearts fortunes fluctuate as Walker attempted to adapt to football's tactical changes by implementing a 4\u20132\u20134 formation.
