His artistic training began in 1930 when he enrolled at Salford Art School, where his abilities were soon recognised and he was awarded the Heywood Medal for Best Student. One of his instructors was Martin Tyas. In 1934 Eckersley moved to London with the express purpose of becoming a freelance poster designer. He was accompanied by Eric Lombers (1914\u20131978), a fellow student and future collaborator on commissioned poster designs. He later cited poster artists Adolphe Mouron Cassandre and Edward McKnight Kauffer as major influences. ", "Tom Eckersley retained copies of many of his posters and examples of his original artwork; these form the equivalent of sketches for the working poster maker. Eckersley used these when teaching, as well as a personal reference. The posters were kept at his home and as such formed a working archive. In addition to retaining examples of his published posters Eckersley also produced and retained posters that he had designed purely for personal enjoyment, such as a series of film posters that depicted the faces of Hollywood movie greats that were only published on a small scale for events like exhibitions of his work.", "*Brief biography for a 2005 exhibition, Tom Eckersley: 50 Works"]}, {"page": "Eckersley", "response": ["*Tom Eckersley (1914\u20131997), English poster artist and design teacher", "*Tom Eckersley (footballer) (born 1991), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["At the end of the 2011\u201312 season, the club confirmed that they had released seven first-team players, along with reserve-team players Mark Connolly, Rhys Bennett, Tope Obadeyi, Tom Eckersley and Dino Fazli\u0107.
