He moved in 2002 for a fee of \u00a3150,000 to Stockport County where he famously scored two goals in a historic victory over Manchester City. After making over 100 appearances for Stockport he moved to Bury before returning to Morecambe.\nHardiker was then released by Morecambe and spent some time at Fleetwood Town before being snapped up by Jim Harvey by signing a contract at Forest Green Rovers.\nHe had a turbulent 2008\u201309 season with Forest Green. He was appointed club captain  until being sidelined for 4 months with injury, after which he made a dramatic return scoring twice in a 3\u20130 win over Northwich. Shortly after this, in late February 2009 he was suspended by the club over a non-club related matter. In March 2009 Hardiker resigned from his contract with Forest Green following his suspension.\nOn 19 March 2009 it was announced that Hardiker has signed a contract with Conference North side Stalybridge Celtic. In late 2010 he joined Droylsden after the two teams agreed an undisclosed fee.\nIn January 2012, Hardiker left Droylsden and signed for Radcliffe Borough.In May 2012 he signed for Northwich Victoria. He left Northwich in December 2012 however and he joined Warrington Town. Because of postponements over the 2012 festive period, Hardiker failed to make a single appearance for Warrington and left the club to sign for Connah's Quay Nomads in January 2013. He left the Welsh club at the end of the season and in August 2013 joined Ashton United. After a season at Ashton, he moved to Lancaster City in June 2014.In October 2018 he signed for Scottish Junior football club Newburgh Juniors.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alex Lawless", "response": ["Lawless scored against Championship team Derby County with a \"superb finish past Carroll from a tight angle\" after evading the opponent defence in an FA Cup third round tie on 3 January 2009, which put Forest Green 2\u20130 up, although they went on to lose 4\u20133. He missed Forest Green's FA Trophy tie against Redditch United because of a hamstring injury, as well as the semi-final of the Conference League Cup against Woking. He made his return in a 2\u20131 defeat to Eastbourne Borough on 17 January 2009 and was substituted in the 64th minute as a precaution. After missing the match against Histon because of a one-match suspension, Lawless contributed with an assist and a goal on his return against Northwich on 18 February 2009, after heading from a corner kick for John Hardiker to score and himself finishing with a goal from close range. He was forced to miss games against Cambridge United and Kidderminster in April 2009 due to a stomach illness, and he made his return in the 2009 Conference League Cup Final, which was lost 3\u20130 to A.F.C. Telford United on a penalty shoot-out, after a 0\u20130 extra time draw. His season ended prematurely after he suffered a broken leg against York City following a heavy challenge on 21 April 2009, with an X-ray confirming his fibula endured a hairline fracture. He completed the season with 39 appearances and six goals and Harvey hoped his budget would allow for Lawless to stay at the club."]}, {"page": "Lancaster and Morecambe College", "response": ["*John Hardiker"]}, {"page": "Hardiker", "response": ["*John Hardiker (born 1982), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Forest Green Rovers F.C. seasons", "response": ["John Hardiker", "John Hardiker"]}, {"page": "Hardiker, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Hardiker"]}]}}
