However, he did not play a league game for the \"Reds\", and after a loan spell to Blackpool in 1996, he signed with Crewe Alexandra in December 1996. He helped the \"Railwaymen\" to win the Second Division play-offs in 1997, but injuries hampered his progress at the club, and he was released and signed with Port Vale in August 2002. He moved on to Bury in August 2003, before moving on to Linfield the following month. The club won the IFA Premiership in 2003\u201304 and finished second the following season, and he moved on to Ballymena United in October 2005. He travelled back to England in summer 2006 for brief spells with non-league clubs Fleetwood Town, Leigh RMI, and Mossley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["The club entered a financial crisis following the collapse of ITV Digital, which cost the club \u00a3400,000 in revenue. This meant Horton had to build his squad for the 2001\u201302 season entirely on free transfers, the most influential proving to be former Coventry City striker Stephen McPhee. Vale beat rivals Stoke City, but ended the season in 14th-place. Horton was named as Manager of the Month after his team earned 13 points from a possible 18 in February. Horton signed Jon McCarthy, Brett Angell, Ian Brightwell, Phil Charnock, Sam Collins, and Mark Boyd for the 2002\u201303 campaign. Four straight defeats were followed by five consecutive victories, as he supplemented his squad with the additions of Lee Ashcroft, Peter Clarke and Adrian Littlejohn. Though relegation was avoided, Horton still remained unpopular with some sections of the Vale's supporters. However the season was dominated by off-the-field issues, as Vale entered administration, and were taken over by Bill Bratt's fan-based consortium."]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.
