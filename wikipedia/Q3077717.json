According to Wendy Doniger, the Burton version is a \"flawed English translation\" but influential as modern translators and abridged versions of Kamasutra even in the Indian languages such as Hindi are re-translations of the Burton version, rather than the original Sanskrit manuscript.[a] Sir Richard Burton\u2019s Version of the Kamasutra, Wendy Doniger, Literary Hub (March 11, 2016);[b] "]}, {"page": "Richard Francis Burton", "response": ["Burton had long had an interest in sexuality and some erotic literature. However, the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 had resulted in many jail sentences for publishers, with prosecutions being brought by the Society for the Suppression of Vice. Burton referred to the society and those who shared its views as Mrs Grundy. A way around this was the private circulation of books amongst the members of a society. For this reason Burton, together with Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot, created the Kama Shastra Society to print and circulate books that would be illegal to publish in public.Ben Grant, \"Translating/'The' \u201cKama Sutra\u201d\", Third World Quarterly, Vol. 26, No. 3, Connecting Cultures (2005), 509\u2013516", "Perhaps Burton's best-known book is his translation of The Kama Sutra. It is untrue that he was the translator since the original manuscript was in ancient Sanskrit, which he could not read. However, he collaborated with Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot on the work and provided translations from other manuscripts of later translations. The Kama Shastra Society first printed the book in 1883 and numerous editions of the Burton translation are in print to this day.", "  at:1883 text:\"1883: Translates the Kama Sutra with Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot.\""]}, {"page": "Arabic literature", "response": ["Literature in Arabic has been influential outside the Islamic world.

In Burton's own words, the main aim of the society (through the publication of the periodical Anthropologia) was \"to supply travelers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters\". Burton had written numerous travel books which invariably included sexual curiosa in extensive footnotes and appendices. His best-known contributions to literature were those considered risqu\u00e9 or even pornographic at the time and which were published under the auspices of the \"Kama Shastra Society\", a fictitious organisation created by Burton and Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot as a legal device to avoid the consequences of current obscenity laws. (Burton and Arbuthnot were the only members of the \"Society\".) These works included The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (1883), published just before his Nights, and The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi (1886), published just after it."]}]}}
