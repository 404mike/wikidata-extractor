They were a second-hand pair of Winit boots bought from the former Doncaster Rovers centre forward, Ray Harrison's sports shop. Keegan played football at Hyde Park using his baby brother, Michael in his pushchair as a goal post. As a boy he supported Doncaster Rovers. His favourite player was Alick Jeffrey, a player, once described by Matt Busby's assistant Jimmy Murphy as the English Pel\u00e9, and once described by Jackie Milburn as the best young player he had ever seen. As a schoolboy, Keegan had a trial for Coventry City, under manager Jimmy Hill. Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back Brian Joy who also went on to have a 15-year career in football. Keegan also had a trial with Doncaster Rovers, arranged by his father, but when Keegan arrived, he found out he had been given the wrong information and the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place."]}, {"page": "1947 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|CF ||9 || Ray Harrison"]}, {"page": "Jack Billingham (footballer)", "response": ["During the war, Billingham served abroad with the Royal Air Force and also worked in a shoe factory in Northampton. He made several appearances as a wartime guest player with his first club, Northampton Town. When competitive play resumed in 1946, Billingham was a first-team regular for Burnley, scoring 12 goals in 28 matches as the side finished as runners-up in the Second Division and reached the 1947 FA Cup Final, although he did not play in the match as Ray Harrison was selected ahead of him. The second place league finish meant promotion to the First Division and Billingham kept his place as first-choice centre forward in the higher division, netting 13 goals in 35 league matches during the 1947\u201348 campaign and helping Burnley to a third-place finish. He spent one more season with the Clarets, but was less involved with the first team and played only 16 matches. In total, he made 96 appearances for Burnley in all competitions and scored 36 goals for the club."]}]}}
