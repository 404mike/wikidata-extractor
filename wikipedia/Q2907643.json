He surprised the enemy's camp, captured 8,000 of the enemy and drove the rest out of Roman territory,Antony Kamm, The Romans, An Introduction, p. 13. for which he was granted a triumph by the people, against the Senate's wishes."]}, {"page": "Gaius Antonius Hybrida", "response": ["Years later, in 70 BC, the censors Gellius and Lentulus expelled Hybrida from the Senate for the criminal offences committed by him while in Greece, for disobeying the summons of a praetor and for the wasteful use of his property. Hybrida is described by the English Historian Antony Kamm as \"a thoroughly disreputable character\" and by author Dunstan as \"thuggish\". In spite of this notorious reputation, Hybrida regained his seat in 68 or 66 after being elected as praetor. Hybrida also probably served as a tribune sometime before his expulsion from the Senate and also served as aedile from 69 to 66. For the consular elections of 64, Hybrida and another candidate, Catiline, received the support of Caesar and Marcus Licinius Crassus for their bids to become consuls of Rome. Dunstan describes Catiline as an \"opportunist\" who had gained notoriety for murders during Sulla's proscriptions; Kamm expands on this description by including the alleged murder of his own son, violation of a Vestal Virgin and many other \"unspeakable profligacies\". A third candidate also existed for the consular elections, Marcus Tullius Cicero, whom Dunstan describes as being a \"brilliant orator\", but he came from an undistinguished family. In the end, Cicero and Hybrida were elected to the position of consul for the year 63."]}, {"page": "Marcia gens", "response": ["* Antony Kamm, The Romans, An Introduction, Routledge, London (1995)."]}, {"page": "Oliver Kamm", "response": ["Kamm is the son of translator Anthea Bell and publisher Antony Kamm.

When the experiment was a success, she commissioned ABC (1962), which won the Greenaway Medal. Since then he has worked with a succession of sympathetic editors, including Antony Kamm and Ron Heapy."]}]}}
