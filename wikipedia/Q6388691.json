He played football for Lewes St Mary's and represented East Sussex at schoolboy level; it was while playing schools football that he was spotted by Brighton & Hove Albion manager Don Welsh. After a trial, he was taken onto the club's ground staff in 1951 and signed professional forms on his 17th birthday in September 1952. National Service obligations and inability to dislodge captain Ken Whitfield from the centre-half position meant Brown did not make his senior debut until 9 November 1957, in a Third Division South match against Northampton Town. Albion won 4\u20132, and \"the critics accorded him a fair share of the credit for\u00a0... their first victory at Northampton for 11 years\", but he returned to the reserves for the next match. Whitfield was reported to have asked for a transfer the following month, but this came to nothing, and Brown appeared just twice more for Albion's first team before moving on after seven years with the club."]}]}}
