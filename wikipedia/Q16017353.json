Des first achieved chart success with Vanity Fare, whose \"Hitchin' a Ride\" sold a million copies in the US alone, but his most notable pop achievement was with glam-rock band Chicory Tip, whose \"Son of My Father\" featured a Moog synthesizer (a relatively obscure instrument at the time). \"Son of My Father\" went on to top the UK pop music charts for three weeks in early 1972 and was a seminal influence on 80s synthesizer bands like ABC. Later in his career, Des worked as musical director for Shirley Bassey, 5000 Volts, and Tony Monopoly, before finally taking a regular day job with the Orchestration Department at BBC Radio Two.\nHe died of cancer on 7 June 2006 in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chicory Tip", "response": ["Roger Easterby and Des Champ were co-producers of the entire Chicory Tip catalogue.

The first member of Chicory Tip to pass away was Rod Cloutt, in Australia in 2017."]}, {"page": "Son of My Father", "response": ["A copy of Giorgio's version found its way to studio manager Roger Easterby who then persuaded the British band Chicory Tip to record it. The song, produced by Easterby and Des Champ, was recorded on Christmas Eve 1971 in the studio of George Martin. The song is notable as the first UK number one single to prominently feature a synthesizer, in this case a Moog synthesizer, programmed by Chris Thomas. The B side of the single is \"Pride Comes Before A Fall\". The song reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in February 1972."]}, {"page": "Carl King (singer)", "response": ["In the meantime, The Meaning's demo record had begun to circulate and found its way to Des Champ at CBS Records in London. After a short audition in the late summer of 1966, CBS offered King a recording contract for three single releases. The first single included two new songs written by well-established songwriters.  A ballad called \"Keep It Coming\", written by American Laurence Weiss, and a blues-rock number, \"Out of my Depth\", by the British duo of Billy Martin and Phil Coulter.  \"Keep It Coming\" was chosen as the A-side (CBS 202407 \u2013 released November 1966). In recent years, however, \"Out of my Depth\" has become a minor cult item and has been re-released on several compilation albums.Album: Mix a Fix \u2013 UK Floor Killers Vol. 2, 2007"]}, {"page": "Guy Darrell", "response": ["In 1966, he released \"I've Been Hurt\" on the CBS label, a 1965 song by Ray Whitley which had already been covered with some success in the US by The Tams. Despite the involvement of Des Champ, this release also failed to reach the UK chart, although it was a top ten hit in South Africa.", "During the remainder of the 1960s, Darrell continued to record for various UK record labels. He was able to record, through his connections with Roger Easterby and Des Champ, a version of Elton John's song \"Skyline Pigeon\" almost a year before the composer's own version was released.", "Meantime, the song \"I've Been Hurt\" had once more been a US hit in 1969 for Bill Deal and the Rhondels, and this version became popular in northern soul clubs such as the Twisted Wheel. Roger Easterby and Des Champ were setting up their own record label, Santa Ponsa Records, and having noted the popularity of the song, made one of the new label's first issues a re-release of Darrell's 1965 recording of it, backed with the original B-side \"Blessed\" written by Paul Simon. The re-release made its way into the UK Singles Chart, earning Darrell a spot on Top of the Pops  (broadcast 20 September 1973) backed by the other members of Deep Feeling. This despite the fact that none of them had played on the recording in question. The song reached a chart high of No. 12 for the week ending 29 September 1973."]}]}}
