He became involved in trade union activities, rising to the presidency of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants. During the 1911 transport strike, he was prominent in leading the successful campaign for union recognition by the railway companies. When the ASRS was merged with two other rail unions in 1913 to form the National Union of Railwaymen, Bellamy was its first president, serving until 1917.From 1917 to 1927 he was a member of the War Pensions Appeal Tribunal. He made his home at Stockport, Cheshire, where he was president of the local Trades Council and Labour Party, as well serving as a magistrate.He stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party at Wakefield at the 1918 and 1922 general elections. He eventually entered the Commons when he was elected Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne at a by-election in October 1928, after the sitting Conservative MP Cornelius Homan was disqualified when he was declared bankrupt.\nBellamy was re-elected at the 1929 general election. Following the election, the Second Labour Government was formed, and he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to F O Roberts, Minister of Pensions. Soon after entering government, Bellamy became ill and died, at Wandsworth, in March 1931, aged 60. The by-election for his seat was won by the Conservative candidate John Broadbent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "National Union of Railwaymen", "response": [":1913: Albert BellamyPhilip Sydney Bagwell, The National Union of Railwaymen, 1913-1963: A Half-century of Industrial Trade Unionism, p. 2."]}, {"page": "Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Albert Bellamy"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|Albert Bellamy", "|Albert Bellamy"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Albert Bellamy"]}, {"page": "1928 Ashton-under-Lyne by-election", "response": ["Labour stood Albert Bellamy, while the Conservatives stood Gordon Touche, and the Liberals put up William Gilbert Greenwood, an accountant."]}, {"page": "John Broadbent", "response": ["After the war he became involved in politics, becoming the president of the Ashton Conservative Association.Lancashire Seats, The Times, 18 May 1929, p. 7 At the 1929 general election, he was the party's candidate in Ashton-under-Lyne, but lost by a margin of over 3,000 votes to the sitting Labour MP, Albert Bellamy."]}, {"page": "Cornelius Homan", "response": ["However, he was disqualified in 1928 after being declared bankrupt.
