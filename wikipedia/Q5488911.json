He was a successful artist during his lifetime and could even count Queen Victoria as an admirer of his work.  His most famous compositions, \"Fairest of Them All\" and \"Puss in Boots\" (1880), have adorned many a wall in the form of plates and posters.  In addition, his series of printed Christmas cards published between 1880 and 1909 have become an affordable way for those interested in Paton's art to begin a collection.", "link_mentions": {}}}
