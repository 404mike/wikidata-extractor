The book paints a vivid picture of the local conditions which helped to foster the spread of the disease in the city. It clearly describes the problems faced by nineteenth-century towns with their inadequate administrative arrangements, organisation and financial resources in trying to cope with the cholera outbreak. One of the fascinating features of the book are the engravings provided for it by the Exeter artist John Gendall. These were added quite late on in the publication process with Shapter commenting that he was pleased to include \"these interesting sketches of old parts of Exeter\"."]}, {"page": "Edward Bowring Stephens", "response": ["Stephens began his artistic training as a pupil of the Exeter-based draughtsman and landscape painter John Gendall (d.1865), who gave classes at his premises at \"Mol's Coffee House\". In 1835, aged 20 he moved to London to become a pupil of the sculptor Edward Hodges Baily (1788\u20131867). In 1836 he was admitted as a student of the Royal Academy and in 1837 gained a silver medal at the Society of Arts for a small original model of Ajax defying the Gods. His first exhibits were in 1838 at the Royal Academy, of Narcissus, An Arcadian Nymph, Maternal Love, and a bust. The next year he sent for exhibit Diana and another bust. Early in 1839 he travelled to Rome, Italy, where he stayed for three years and gained valuable experience.", "Stephens promoted the establishment of the School of ArtNational Dictionary of Biography which opened in Queen Street, Exeter, in 1854. Its transformation into a city museum was the result of a local initiative following the death of Prince Albert in 1861 when in the following year at a public meeting in the Exeter Guildhall chaired by the mayor it was agreed \"desirable to erect a memorial in the City of Exeter to His late Royal Highness the Prince Consort\". The result was the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, in Queen Street, Exeter, opened in 1868, which incorporated adjuncts for the study of art, science and literature. One of its original curators, who acquired for it many of the early exhibits, was Stephens' old master John Gendall, who however died in 1865 before the opening. In 1862 Stephens offered to the planned museum plastercast copies of any his works they \"thought worthy of acceptance\". He also offered to execute a memorial statue of the Prince without charge for his labour, the museum committee to pay for the materials only.Mapping At the museum's opening the resultant statue was in situ within an aedicule on the landing of the grand staircase, where it remains in 2013. Following the death of John Gendall in 1865, Stephens tried unsuccessfully to raise public funds to purchase for the museum from Gendall's widow his collection of prints and paintings. Following Stephens' death in 1882 the Earl of Devon also tried without success to organise the purchase for the museum of his work The Bathers.Exeter Memories", "*Biography of John Gendall, Exeter Memories"]}, {"page": "Thomas Mogford (painter)", "response": ["Mogford was born in Exeter on 1 May 1809, son of a veterinary surgeon of Northlew, Devon.
