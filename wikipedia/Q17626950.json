He was born at Littleport, Cambridgeshire and died at Ashdon, Essex.\nLuddington was educated at Uppingham School, where he was coached by the famous cricketer H. H. Stephenson, at The King's School, Ely and at Jesus College, Cambridge. He had a trial match for the Cambridge University cricket team in 1874, but did not get into the first eleven until 1876 when he achieved some success with his right-arm fast bowling, delivering the ball round arm. His batting as a right-handed tail-ender was negligible. Picked for the 1876 University Match against Oxford University, he took 5 for 51 in the first innings and 4 for 72 in the second as Cambridge won by seven wickets; in the first innings, he shared the Oxford wickets with William Patterson, with whom he had been at school at Uppingham. Luddington's best bowling performance came for Cambridge in 1877 against the Marylebone Cricket Club: he took 5 for 28 as MCC, including W. G. Grace, were dismissed for just 60. In the 1877 University Match, Luddington and Patterson again shared the Oxford first-innings wickets equally, Luddington taking 5 for 90, but Oxford won the match easily. After leaving Cambridge, Luddington played only one further first-class match, appearing for the Gentlemen of England in a fixture at Cambridge in 1878.\nLuddington appears not to have followed any career after graduating from Cambridge in 1877; he was a Justice of the Peace and a county councillor for the Isle of Ely after that district achieved county status with local government reform in 1888. He bought Walton's Park at Ashdon on the Essex/Cambridgeshire border in 1917 and died there five years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luddington", "response": ["*Henry Luddington (1854\u20131922), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "William Patterson (cricketer, born 1854)", "response": ["Greater use was made in 1875 of Patterson's bowling, and he was also more consistent as a batsman, playing as a middle- or lower-order batsman; in the University Match, he took three Oxford wickets in each innings and scored 12 and 18, but Cambridge lost the match by just six runs. There was further improvement in both batting and bowling in 1876. Against the Gentlemen of England side, in a 12-a-side match, he took 11 wickets in the match with 7 for 64 in the first innings. In the 1876 University Match, Patterson shared the first-innings wickets with his Uppingham School fast-bowling colleague, Henry Luddington, taking five for 42, and then scored an unbeaten 105 in the Cambridge innings, for less than a day the highest innings in the University Match series \u2013 Oxford's captain William Game scored 109 in his second innings \u2013 and the only century of Patterson's first-class career. He was then picked for the Gentlemen side in the Gentlemen v Players match at Prince's Cricket Ground, where he took seven wickets (though W. G. Grace took 10). By the end of the season, in only eight first-class games, Patterson had taken 52 wickets."]}, {"page": "Leslie Davidson", "response": ["Davidson was born at Inchmarlo in Kincardineshire on 31 January 1850. His father was Patrick Davidson, a professor of civil law, while his mother was Mary Anne Leslie, daughter of William Leslie, 10th Laird of Warthill. Deciding upon on a career in the British Army, he attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Davidson graduated top of his year in July 1869, and was commissioned into the Royal Horse Artillery as a lieutenant. Davidson was first posted to British India in 1874 and was appointed aide-de-camp to Lord Napier in November of the following year. Returning to Britain, he played in a first-class cricket match in 1877 for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Cambridge University at Fenner's. Batting once in the match, he was dismissed without scoring by Henry Luddington. Described by Wisden as a \"a fine, free hitter\", prior to his appearance for the MCC he had played minor matches for Northamptonshire, five years prior to the formation of the county club. He also represented the Royal Artillery in cricket, football, rackets and billiards."]}]}}
