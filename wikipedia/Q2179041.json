She joined Anita Chapman and Rebecca Gale to gain a bronze medal for the UK in the women\u2019s archery team open. At these games Chapman also won a silver medal. She had surgery in 1999 and she thought this might rule her out of competition, but at the 2000 Summer Paralympics she was again in Britain's team of three archers who competed for the women\u2019s archery team open and this time they took the silver. Chapman gained a gold medal and Smith gained an individual silver in the women\u2019s individual W1/W2 behind Paola Fantato of Italy. Four years later Smith won her fourth and last medal which was gold. She gained the gold in the women\u2019s archery team open and again Anita Chapman was a team mate."]}]}}
