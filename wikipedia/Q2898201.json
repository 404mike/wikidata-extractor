From a Tory background, he was well-connected in the political and literary world, and made a mark by his championing of Italian poets and a burlesque style of verse based on their influence as satirists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Scott", "response": ["Three years after The Lay Scott published Marmion (1808) telling a story of corrupt passions leading up as a disastrous climax to the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The main innovation involves prefacing each of the six cantos with an epistle from the author to a friend: William Stewart Rose, The Rev. John Marriot, William Erskine, James Skene, George Ellis, and Richard Heber: the epistles develop themes of moral positives and special delights imparted by art. In an unprecedented move, the publisher Archibald Constable purchased the copyright of the poem for a thousand guineas at the beginning of 1807, when only the first had been completed.Walter Scott, 2018. Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field, ed. Ainsley McIntosh. Edinburgh. pp. 292\u201293.  Constable's faith was justified by the sales: the three editions published in 1808 sold 8,000 copies. The verse of Marmion is less striking than that of The Lay, with the epistles in iambic tetrameters and the narrative in tetrameters with frequent trimeters. The reception by the reviewers was less favourable than that accorded The Lay: style and plot were both found faulty, the epistles did not link up with the narrative, there was too much antiquarian pedantry, and Marmion's character was immoral.J. H. Alexander, 1976. Two Studies in Romantic Reviewing, Vol. 2. Salzburg. pp. 358\u2012369.  The most familiar lines in the poem sum up one of its main themes: \"O what a tangled web we weave,/ When first we practice to deceive\"Canto 6, stanza 17 (6.766\u201267)."]}, {"page": "Orlando Furioso", "response": ["There have been several verse translations of Orlando Furioso into English, most using the 8-line stanzas (octaves) of the original (abababcc).

Written during the time of the Revolution in France, it was intended to exhibit the feelings and hopes of the people and the defects and absurdities of various political systems. Some of Goya's print series The Disasters of War drew from the Spanish translation of 1813. The Novelle Galanti is a series of poetical tales, in the ottava rima metre largely used by Italian poets for that class of compositions.
