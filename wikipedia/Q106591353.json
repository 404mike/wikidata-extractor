Narrated in sprawling Renaissance prose, the romance comprises five \"books or acts,\" organized according to the five-part structure of classical dramaturgy: exposition, action, complication, reversal, catastrophe. This hybrid structure\u2014part prose romance and part classical drama\u2014allows Sidney to contain the diverseness of romance within the cohesiveness of the dramatic arc. The work is often called \"tragicomic\" for its combination of a \"serious\" high plot centering on the princes and Duke Basilius's household and a \"comic\" low plot that centers on the steward Dametas's family. The standard modern edition of Old Arcadia, on which this synopsis is based, is edited by Jean Robertson (Clarendon: Oxford, 1973)."]}, {"page": "Rose Mary Crawshay Prize", "response": ["|Jean Robertson"]}, {"page": "Jean Robertson", "response": ["* Jean Robertson (Jean Bromley, 1913\u20131990), British scholar of English renaissance literature", "*Jean Robertson (actress) (c.1894\u20131967), Australian stage and screen actress", "* Jean Robertson Burnet (1920\u20132009), Canadian academic's maiden name", "* Jean McKenzie (Jean Robertson McKenzie, 1901\u20131964), New Zealand diplomat", "* Jean Robertson-Holley (n\u00e9e Jean Robertson), a fictional character from Unclaimed", "* Jean Robertson, a character and teratology of novels from Jane Duncan"]}]}}
