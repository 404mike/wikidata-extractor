His most notable publications include The Meaning of Conservatism (1980), Sexual Desire (1986), The Aesthetics of Music (1997), and How to Be a Conservative (2014). He was a regular contributor to the popular media, including The Times, The Spectator, and the New Statesman.\nScruton embraced conservatism after witnessing the May 1968 student protests in France. From 1971 to 1992 he was a lecturer and professor of aesthetics at Birkbeck College, London, after which he held several part-time academic positions, including in the United States.  In the 1980s he helped to establish underground academic networks in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe, for which he was awarded the Czech Republic's Medal of Merit (First Class) by President V\u00e1clav Havel in 1998. Scruton was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for \"services to philosophy, teaching and public education\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aesthetics", "response": ["* Roger Scruton, Beauty: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009.
