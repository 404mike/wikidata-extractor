Sheffield historian S. O. Addy, writing in 1888, noted that the Old English word hl\u00e2w is almost always used to refer to a burial mound, and speculated that this 'great heap of stones' may have been an ancient barrow. He further suggested that the etymology of the name Ringinglow suggests that 'originally the heap may have been a round burial mound, or mound surrounded by a circle'. (transcribed at wikisource) Addy additionally noted that there existed a 'folk etymology' for the name Ringinglow (transcribed at wikisource)\u2014a story also recounted by local historian J. Edward Vickers\u2014that the village got its name after a man lost on the moors in bad weather was saved when he heard the bells of Sheffield parish church 'ringing low' over the moors.
