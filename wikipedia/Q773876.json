Holmes argued that Page 3 perpetuated outdated sexist norms, portrayed women as sex objects, negatively affected girls' and women's body image, and contributed to a culture of sexual violence. Launched in August 2012, the campaign gained support at the Liberal Democrats party conference the following month, where former MP Evan Harris proposed a party motion to \"[tackle] the projection of women as sex objects to children and adolescents by restricting sexualised images in newspapers and general-circulation magazines to the same rules that apply to pre-watershed broadcast media\". Liberal Democrats MP Lynne Featherstone supported the motion, claiming that Page 3 contributed to domestic violence against women, although the party's then-leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg distanced himself from it over concerns about press freedom, stating: \"If you don't like it, don't buy it ... you don't want to have a moral policeman or woman in Whitehall telling people what they can and cannot see\".

This requirement was abolished in December 2014, nine months after the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 permitted same-sex marriages. In both England and Wales and Scotland, such an application from a married person requires written consent from the spouse \u2013 the so-called spousal veto.

Some parliamentarians, such as Evan Harris, viewed the original requirement as inhumane and destructive of the family. MP Hugh Bayley said in the Commons debate \"I can think of no other circumstance in which the state tells a couple who are married and who wish to remain married that they must get divorced\". Despite this opposition, the government chose to retain this requirement of the Bill. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, David Lammy, speaking for the Government, said \"it is the Government's firm view that we cannot allow a small category of same-sex marriages\".
