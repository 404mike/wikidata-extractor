He was a member of the team that played Derbyshire's first match in May 1871.\nSmith was born in Sawley, the son of John Smith a farmer and his wife Ruth. He was educated at Castle Donington School in Leicestershire and continued farming at Sawley.\nSmith took part in the very first fixture played by Derbyshire as a county team in the 1871 season, against a Lancashire side who posted the lowest total against Derbyshire in the history of first-class cricket. He played in both matches between Derbyshire and Lancashire in the 1872 and 1873 seasons. In the 1874 season, with Kent taking on Derbyshire Smith played in all four matches none of which was lost. Also in 1874, he appeared for the United North of England team in a first-class match against the South. His team included early leading lights of cricket such as Tom Emmett, former Yorkshire captain Ephraim Lockwood, and uncle-and-nephew pairing Andrew (a two-time Test player) and Yorkshire captain Luke Greenwood. The South of England had at their disposal early soon-to-become Test greats such as James Lillywhite jnr., Harry Jupp, and Dr. William Gilbert Grace, a combination of early Test cricketers who served to overpower their less experienced opponents. A return match saw a three-day draw, though it came complete with a nine-wicket haul for Grace.\nSmith played seven matches for Derbyshire in the 1875 season and was appointed captain of Derbyshire for the 1876 season when the club won three and lost four. Also in 1876 he played for an All-England team as innings victors against the United South of England.\nIn the 1877 season Smith's batting average was up to the twenties and his Derbyshire side won five matches to three losses. In the 1878 season Smith was top scorer for Derbyshire with 390 runs and played again for a losing North side against South Derbyshire lost more of their matches in this season. The 1879 season was also less successful for the club and Smith's average fell to single figures. In the 1880 Derbyshire faced the touring Australian, captained by Harry Boyle. The highly experienced Australian team, consisting entirely of contemporary Test players, won with an innings to spare. Also in 1880 Smith opened for the Gentlemen against the Players, along with George Barrington, just three weeks after an innings victory over a Canadian representative team, which included Thomas Phillips and Walter Gilbert. Smith carried on captaining the Derbyshire team in the 1881, 1882 and 1883 seasons playing more matches but seeing fewer wins. He handed over captaincy to Ludford Docker for the 1884 season in which he played his last six matches.\nSmith was a right-handed batsman and played 190 innings in 103 first-class matches with an average of 14.54 and a top score of 87. Smith was a slow right-arm underarm bowler but took no wickets in around eight overs.Smith continued as a farmer of 50 acres (200,000 m2) with one employee, living with his wife Sarah, a brother, John, eight years his junior, and a domestic servant. In 1885 he changed his name to Robert Posnett Stevens and in 1891 was Lord of the Manor of Breaston. He died at Staunton Grange, Nottinghamshire at the age of 50.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Smith", "response": ["Robert Smith or Bob Smith, or similar, may refer to:", "* Robert Smith (American actor) (1912\u20132001), American actor", "* Robert Smith (Canadian actor) (1966\u20132020), Canadian actor and voice actor", "* Robert Smith (musician) (born 1959), lead singer and guitarist of The Cure", "*Robert Smith (Medal of Honor) (1847\u20131930), American Indian Wars soldier and Medal of Honor recipient", "*Robert Smith (Australian Army officer) (1881\u20131928), Australian wool merchant and army officer", "*Robert Smith (Ontario politician) (1819\u20131900), Canadian Member of Parliament for Peel, Ontario", "*Robert Smith (judge) (1858\u20131942), Canadian Member of Parliament for Stormont, Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada", "*Robert Smith (Newfoundland politician) (1879\u20131972), Newfoundland politician and merchant", "*Robert Smith (British Columbia politician), Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Canadian province of British Columbia, 1871\u20131878", "*Robert Smith, political party secretary who was convicted (c. 1985) for promoting hatred in activities of the Nationalist Party of Canada", "*Robert Smith (MP for Wycombe), Member of Parliament (MP) for Wycombe", "*Robert Smith (MP for Derby) in 1420 and 1421, MP for Derby", "*Robert Smith (MP for Devizes) (fl. 1414\u20131421), English politician", "*Robert Smith (fl. 1545), MP for Carlisle", "*Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington (1752\u20131838), British Member of Parliament", "*Sir Robert Smith, 1st Baronet (1880\u20131957), Scottish Unionist politician, MP 1924\u20131945", "*Sir Robert Smith, 3rd Baronet (born 1958), Liberal Democrat politician from Scotland, MP 1997\u20132005", "*Robert Smith (Cabinet member) (1757\u20131842), Secretary of State and of the Navy", "*Robert Smith (Illinois politician) (1802\u20131867), U.S. Representative from Illinois", "* Robert Smith (bishop) (1732\u20131801), the first American Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of South Carolina", "* Robert Smith (priest) (1932\u20132010), American Catholic priest, author, and educator", "* Robert Smith (surgeon) (1840\u20131885), Sierra Leonean medical doctor", "* Robert Smith (aerospace engineer), American business executive and aerospace engineer", "*Robert Smith (defensive end) (born 1962), gridiron football defensive end", "*Robert Smith (running back) (born 1972), American football running back", "*Robert Smith (safety) (born 1992), American football safety", "* Robert Smith (footballer, born 1848) (1848\u20131914), Scottish international footballer", "* Robert Smith (Darwen footballer), English footballer for Darwen in the late 1800s", "* Robert Smith (footballer, born 1912), English football player and manager of Ajax Amsterdam", "*Robert Smith (baseball) (born 1936), former International Baseball Federation president; instrumental in baseball becoming an Olympic sport", "*Robert Smith (basketball) (born 1955), American basketball player, NBA", "*Robert Smith (Australian cricketer) (1868\u20131927), Australian cricketer, played one first-class cricket match for Victoria in 1890", "*Robert Smith (Derbyshire cricketer) (1848\u20131899), English cricketer, played first class cricket for Derbyshire 1871\u201384, captain 1876\u201383", "*Robert Smith (South African cricketer) (1923\u20132001), South African cricketer", "*Robert Smith (Wellington cricketer) (born 1946), New Zealand cricketer", "*Robert Smith (Otago cricketer) (born 1974), Australian cricketer who played in New Zealand", "*Robert Smith (Cumberland cricketer) (born 1982), English cricketer, played for Cumberland in 2001", "* Robert Smith (boxer) (1908\u2013?), South African Olympic boxer", "* Robert Smith (canoeist) (1929\u20132001), Canadian sprint canoer who competed in the late 1950s", "* Robert Smith (equestrian) (born 1961), British Olympic equestrian", "* Robert Smith (bowler) (born 1974), American professional bowler", "* Robert Smith (sport shooter), English sport shooter", "* Robert Smith (mathematician) (1689\u20131768), English mathematician and music theorist", "* Robert Smith (architect) (1722\u20131777), American architect", "* Robert Smith (trade unionist) (1862\u20131934), general secretary of the National Union of Scottish Mineworkers", "* Robert Smith (colonial administrator) (1887\u20131959), British Governor of North Borneo", "* Robert Smith (professor) (1919\u20132009), expert on the history of the Yoruba people of Nigeria", "* Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin (born 1944), governor of the BBC", "* Robert Smith (journalist) (born 1967), NPR reporter"]}, {"page": "Arthur Forman", "response": ["Forman made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1877 season against Hampshire, in an innings victory for Derbyshire.
