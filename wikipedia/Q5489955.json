Music proved too difficult for him, however, and he wanted to act from an early age. His father, who worked in a bank, wanted him to get a \"proper\" job, so he began working in insurance after leaving Alleyn's School. He soon enrolled at a small acting school, the London School of Dramatic Art, and took evening classes. After two years working at the insurance company, he was invited to become a day student at the acting school and persuaded his father to finance his studies."]}]}}
