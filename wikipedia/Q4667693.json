In his time there he mixed with upcoming talents such as Damien Hirst, Michael Landy, Sam Taylor-Wood, and Abigail Lane, some of the future leading lights of the Britart movement. He quit college due to the increasing success of his band at the time, Seymour, which later changed its name to Blur because the recording company, Food Records, thought Seymour was too 'student-ish'. They presented a list to the band of preferred names which included \"The Shining Path\" and \"Blur\". As well as providing all guitars, backing vocals, and occasional drums, Coxon's lo-fi and alternative musical style and tastes influenced the band's less commercial music in the late 1990s. He sang lead vocals on songs including \"Red Necks\", \"You're So Great\" from the album Blur, and \"Coffee & TV\", as well as a section of the chorus of \"Tender\", the bridge of \"Lonesome Street\" and a section of \"Thought I Was a Spaceman\" on The Magic Whip."]}, {"page": "Freeze (art exhibition)", "response": ["*Abigail Lane"]}, {"page": "Lane (surname)", "response": ["*Abigail Lane (born 1967), English artist"]}]}}
