They were attached to Tito's headquarters, then in the ruined castle of Jajce. Here and elsewhere, Maclean lived in proximity to the Partisan leader for a year and a half, on and off.  Maclean gives much of this section of the book to his personal assessment of the Partisan position and of Tito as a man and as a leader.  Their talks, in German and Russian (while Maclean learned Serbo-Croat), were wide-ranging, and from them Maclean gained hope that a future Communist Yugoslavia might not be the fear-wracked place the USSR was. The Partisans were extremely proud of their movement, dedicated to it, and prepared to live a life of austerity in its cause. All of this won his admiration.", "They arrived in England to find \"the whole of the southern counties [were] one immense armed camp\". Despite the tension over the anticipated invasion of Normandy, the press and officials were eager to hear the Yugoslav story, and Maclean and Velebit had a busy time; even U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to meet them. At Chequers Maclean participated in attempts to build a possible compromise between the Royalist government in exile and the Partisans. As Maclean was preparing to go back to Bari and Bosnia, he received news that the enemy had made a fierce attack on Partisan headquarters at Drvar, later known as the Knight's Move. \"It was the kind of communication that took your breath away.\" When he got the full story from Vivian Street, he heard how the German bombers had made a full and thorough attack, and, after Tito and the Partisans escaped, revenged themselves on the civilians, massacring almost everyone, men, women, and children. In the week that followed the attack on Drvar, Allied planes flew more than a thousand sorties in support of the Partisans.  Tito, harassed and harried through the woods, reached the decision that he needed to leave and establish his headquarters in a place of security. Accordingly, he asked Vivian Street to arrange for the Allies to evacuate him and his staff, which they did. Maclean, on his way back from London, caught up with the Marshal at Bari, and found him proposing to establish his base on Vis. The Royal Navy took him across in fine style, with a memorable wardroom dinner, at which Tito recited, in English, \"The Owl and the Pussycat\".", "From Bari, he calculated that Tito would want to be directing the recapture of Belgrade, so he headed towards there himself, landing at Valjevo with a jeep.  It was here that \"Lili Marlene\", the song broadcast from Radio Belgrade and which he had listened to night after night, from the desert to the mountain tops, finally ceased. \"Not long now,\" he thought. The Partisan troops travelled through Arandjelovac and soon met up with the Red Army, who were being hailed as liberators.  Maclean noted that almost every one of them was a fighting soldier, and that their vehicles carried nothing but petrol and ammunition. For the rest, he presumed, they got from the enemy or the local people. \"We were witnessing a return to the administrative methods of Attila and Genghis Khan, and the results seemed to deserve careful attention.\"  In the last ten miles outside the capital, they passed hundreds and hundreds of corpses from the recent battle, and a neat stack of a hundred or more who appeared to have been executed.  When they reached the HQ of General Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107, his chief of staff, who had only a vague notion of the geography of the city, took Maclean and Vivian Street out for a tour, through heavy shelling that he appeared oblivious to.  From the terrace of the Kalemegdan, the ancient fort in the middle of the city, they witnessed the withdrawal of German troops over the Danube to the suburb of Zemun.  Inexplicably, the Germans failed to blow up the bridge after the last of their troops were over it, allowing the Russians to follow only minutes behind.  Maclean, some time afterwards, found out the answer to this puzzle, comparing it to a fairytale.  An old schoolmaster, whose one experience of modern warfare was in the Balkan War of 1912, saw the charges being laid and knew how to disconnect them. He got a gold medal in 1912 and another for this initiative too."]}, {"page": "Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1944)", "response": ["Tito's personal headquarters was initially located in a cave below a ridgeline about  north of the centre of Drvar. Below the cave ran the Unac River, creating an obstacle to movement between the town and the cave, and a rail line ran along the ridgeline above the cave. As well as Partisan headquarters, several Partisan and Communist Party support, training and youth organisations were based in and around Drvar at the time, along with the Tito Escort Battalion which was responsible for Tito's personal safety. The British and Soviet military missions to the Partisans were also stationed in villages close to Drvar, as were some United States military officers. The British mission was headed by Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean, who was in London at the time of the raid, and included Major Randolph Churchill, son of Winston Churchill. At the time of Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (), the British mission was led by its second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Vivian Street."]}, {"page": "Vivian Street", "response": ["Vivian Street is a mostly one-way arterial road in central Wellington, New Zealand.

Hence, he picked cavalry officer Robin Whetherly (27), SAS Major Vivian Street and John Henniker-Major (27) another soldier-diplomat to accompany him.  Later, they were joined by three sappers: Peter Moore, Donald Knight and Mike Parker who was to be in charge of supply logistics and Gordon Alston (25), an intelligence officer.  The security was assigned to Sgt Duncan, Cpl Dickson (Scots Guards) and Cpl Kelly (Seaforth Highlanders) and communication to two wireless operators.  Just before the departure, they were joined by an American Major Linn \"Slim\" Farish (41), who claimed that he could build aerodromes.  It was decided to leave two officers, David Satow and Sgt Charlie Button behind as rear-link and supply support.Maclean, pp. 294-298", "They found the country in suspense, with numerous American and Allied troops preparing for the D-Day invasion.  They were taken to meet senior army officers including General Eisenhower and finally the Prime Minister.  Velebit was pleased with being able to put his point of view to Mr Churchill personally and had made other useful contacts within the Establishment and the Press, hoping to keep Tito and the Partisan movement before the mind of the public.  He then flew back, preceded by Vivian Street who took charge of the mission while Maclean remained in London for numerous further discussions.Maclean, pp. 446-447", "As Maclean was preparing for the return journey, an urgent signal arrived from Vivian Street stating that on 25 May there had been a large-scale airborne attack on Partisan HQ with gliders and parachute troops, that the Partisans had suffered heavy casualties and that Tito and the Allies' missions had managed to escape capture.  Unbeknown to him, a meticulously planned and executed Operation R\u00f6sselsprung was underway.  Tito had by now realised that he could no longer lead the Partisan movement while being constantly on the move.  The decision was made to evacuate the HQ and the missions, first to Bari and then onto Vis.  The flight was organised by the RAF and executed by a Russian crew.Maclean, pp. 449-456", "Maclean assumed that Tito had moved inland in order to direct the liberation of Belgrade.  He decided to fly to a recently-liberated Valjevo and continue his search in Serbia.  Partisan troops moved quickly and after a couple of days in Aran\u0111elovac, Maclean and his team left for Belgrade on 20 October.  Their three-jeep expedition included two BLOs - Vivian Street and Freddie Cole and two Americans - Colonel Ellery Huntington, the Commander of the US Military Mission to the Partisans and Charles Thayer, his second-in-command and a friend of Maclean from the prewar Moscow days.  The fact that the two spoke Russian was very useful when encountering Soviet troops on their way. They eventually reached the centre of the city and its main vantage point, Kalemegdan, from where they observed the hasty withdrawal of German troops pursued by the Soviets.Maclean, pp. 498-513"]}]}}
