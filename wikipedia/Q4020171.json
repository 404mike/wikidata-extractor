Her parents were William Frederick Collings and his Montreal-born wife Sophie (n\u00e9e Moffatt). Collings was born two years after her notoriously intemperate father inherited the fief from his father, William Thomas Collings. She had one sibling, a sister named Doris."]}, {"page": "William Frederick Collings", "response": ["Collings was the elder son and one of six children of William Thomas Collings, Seigneur of Sark, and the lichenologist Louisa Collings (n\u00e9e Lukis). An exceptionally tall and well-built blue-eyed man, he was the exact opposite of his father. The two never got along with each other. Collings refused to follow his father into the Church and Trinity College, Cambridge. The compromise was a Grand Tour."]}, {"page": "Marie Collings", "response": ["Collings was born into a wealthy family from Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands. She was one of the two daughters of the privateer John Allaire (1762\u20131846), the other one being Catherine Allaire. Her father was reputedly the most affluent man in Guernsey, whose fortune appears to have stemmed not only from privateering during the Napoleonic Wars, but also from outright piracy. She was married to Thomas Gu\u00e9rin Collings, Constable of the Town and Parish of Saint Peter Port. The couple had a son, William Thomas Collings (1823\u20131882), and several daughters. Collings' husband died in 1832.", "By the time she became Dame of Sark, she was already too old to actively participate in the government of the island. She never visited it during her tenure, \"to the regret of the Sark people\". La Seigneurie, official residence of the ruler of Sark, was modernised and extended during Collings' brief rule, just like it was in the 1730s, when another widow, Susanne le Pelley, bought the fief. Collings meanwhile resided in Guernsey, and was represented in Sark by her only son and heir apparent, the Anglican priest William Thomas Collings. He succeeded her as seigneur of Sark upon her death in 1853, less than a year after the purchase. She was also survived by a daughter, Catherine Ann Allaire Ozanne (1826\u20131879). The island remains in Collings' family; her descendant Christopher Beaumont is the current seigneur."]}, {"page": "William Collings Lukis", "response": ["His sister Louisa was married to William Thomas Collings, Seigneur of Sark, and is the ancestor of the island's ruler until 2016, Michael Beaumont."]}, {"page": "Collings (surname)", "response": ["*William Thomas Collings (1824\u20131882), Seigneur of Sark from 1853 to 1882"]}, {"page": "Louisa Collings", "response": ["Louisa Elizabeth Collings (n\u00e9e Lukis; 4 June 1818 or 1828 \u2013 24 March 1887) was an amateur lichenologist and natural history collector from the Channel Islands.

The ceremony was conducted by her brother, William Collings Lukis, at St Saviour's Church. They had four daughters and two sons, William Frederick (1852\u20131927) and Henry de Vic (1855\u20131872). On the death of her mother-in-law Marie the next year, her husband became Seigneur of Sark. She was widowed in 1882, when the fief of Sark passed to her son; the seigneur from 1974, Michael Beaumont, is her descendant. Collings decided to pay a visit to her eldest daughter, Mary Edmeades, who lay ill in Folkestone. She died there on 24 March 1887, having suffered from bronchitis for three days, shortly after her daughter. She had outlived all her children except for the Seigneur; her other daughters died respectively in 1851, 1859 and 1871. Her collection passed to Guernsey's newly established Guille-All\u00e8s Museum. It is considered one of the city's most important natural history collections."]}]}}
