The mansion, built in 1865\u20131868, was originally a family home for James Burns and his son John, and later the Allan family, from the early 20th Century until just after the war, when the estate was sold to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow. Gillespie, Kidd & Coia employees Isi Metzstein and Andy MacMillan developed a radical design in which the old house would become professorial accommodation, and around it would wrap a striking new main block, a convent block, a sanctuary block and a classroom block. The old house thus became one side of a quadrangle, creating a juxtaposition between old and new buildings."]}, {"page": "James Burns", "response": ["James Burns may refer to:", "* James Burns (businessman) (1921\u20132019), Canadian businessman", "* James Burns (merchant), Glasgow-born merchant of the 17th century", "* James Burns (Scottish shipowner) (1789\u20131871)", "* James Burns (publisher) (1808\u20131871), Scottish publisher and author", "* James Burns (shipowner) (1846\u20131923), Australian businessman", "* James Burns (Spiritualist) (1835\u20131894), Scottish journalist and publisher", "* James Burns (cricketer) (1866\u20131957), English cricketer", "* James Burns, 3rd Baron Inverclyde (1864\u20131919)"]}, {"page": "James Burns (1789-1871)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Burns (Scottish shipowner)"]}, {"page": "1871 in Scotland", "response": ["* 6 September \u2013 James Burns, shipowner (born 1789)"]}]}}
