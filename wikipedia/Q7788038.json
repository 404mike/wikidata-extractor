He was among an early group of missionaries who went out from London in response to a request from African Baptists on the island. He established churches and schools to aid the slaves. Burchell is credited with the concept of Free Villages and encouraging their development by Baptist colleagues such as William Knibb, as well as by other denominations. Anticipating abolition of slavery, he helped raise funds in Great Britain to acquire land for freedmen after they were emancipated, and to develop Free Villages.", "Thomas Burchell was born on Christmas Day, 25 December 1799, in Tetbury, Gloucestershire. He had a brother William, who supported his later missionary efforts. Their paternal grandfather was the Baptist minister in the town.
