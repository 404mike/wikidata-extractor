Quote: 'At that time the apostle and evangelist John, the one whom Jesus loved,...' Objections are raised against the identification of John the Apostle with the \"disciple whom Jesus loved\", because the latter is not mentioned before the Last Supper.Craig S. Keener, The Gospel of John: Volume One. p. 84 notes, \"One could argue that the beloved disciple is not one of the Twelve because he is not mentioned by the 'beloved disciple' until the last discourse and passion narrative (one could also use this to separate sections of the gospels into sources).\" See also Robert Kysar, John, the maverick Gospel, (Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1976), 919 The title (\"beloved disciple\") is also strange to George Beasley-Murray because \"if the beloved disciple were one of the Twelve, he would have been sufficiently known outside the Johannine circle of churches for the author to have named him\".Keener, The Gospel of John: Volume 1, 84; See also George Beasley-Murray, John, (Waco: Word Books, 1987), lxxiii"]}, {"page": "G.
