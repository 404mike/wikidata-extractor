The next season for Saunders role in midfield increased. On 6 November 2011, Saunders provided a double assist for Sam Williams and Luke Wilkinson, who scored a winner, in a 3\u20132 win over Oxford United and on 1 December, he scored his first of the season in a 2\u20131 loss against Torquay United. After the game, Saunders said he expected to score and said: \"I feel in previous games I've come close to scoring with a few strikes and it was a relief to be honest to get on the scoresheet, Hopefully now I've got one I'll start to get a few more. When you score and don't get anything out of the game it kind of gets forgotten but if it's a goal that gets you a point or a goal which wins a game or helps win a game, you get more recognition for it.\" That did happen when followed up by his second on 5 January 2013, in a match against Accrington Stanley and set up a goal for Luke Howell in a 2\u20130 win.
