He realised that across the UK Ministry of Defence and wider government no organisation was either adaptable or innovative enough to research 21st Century security challenges. ARAG brought together experts from the military, academia and other fields in \"research clusters\" dedicated to specific areas of concern, in order to provide policy-makers with focussed analysis of international security issues. ARAG members were hand-picked and came from a wide background of skills, experience and nationalities.  ARAG subsumed the Conflict Studies Research Centre, previously known as the Soviet Studies Research Centre, which for nearly 40 years had studied the Soviet Union, working in open source organic languages to supplement MoD and Intelligence Service assets.  ARAG worked across government departments undertaking both directed and undirected research and broadening its reach to encompass new security challenges such as China, cyber security and strategic communication.  It produced a large number of research papers - made freely available to the public from the Defence Academy website - as well as more targeted limited distribution work.  Many of these papers became seminal reference works including Russia and The West: A Reassessment by Dr James Sherr, Charles Blandy's correct prediction of the Russian attack on Georgia, Professor James Pettifer's analysis of the Greek financial crisis and the joint paper by Major General Andrew Mackay and Commander Steve Tatham. Mackay is on public record as stating that ARAG was the only organisation in the MoD capable of helping him plan and write his operational design for his Brigade tour in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2007.  ARAG also administered the Defence Academy Reserve Cadre, a network of over 70 Reserve Forces personnel with unusual civilian skills sets or languages.  The Cadre personnel were designed to augment regular forces and other government departments in providing specialist civilian skills in operational areas.  They were also, at one point, the only part of the UK Defence Community directly assisting the UK Prevent agenda through their mentoring at the Active Change Foundation.  The cadre was described by then Vice Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman as a 'work of genius'."]}, {"page": "List of governors of Edinburgh Castle", "response": ["*19 June 2009 \u2013 25 October 2009: Major-General Andrew Mackay"]}, {"page": "52nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)", "response": ["In November 2006, it was reported that Land Command planners had offered up HQ 52 Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Andrew Mackay for a November 2007 deployment to Afghanistan for Operation Herrick VII, and that the rotation plan 'was now awaiting final approval by government ministers.'Tim Ripley, \"UK infantry brigade to get Afghan role,\" Jane's Defence Weekly, 15 November 2006, p.7.|", "In July 2007, the Ministry of Defence announced that 52 BrigadeScots Guards Make It Safe For Villagers To Return Home In Helmand would provide the command element for the UK Task Force on Operation Herrick VII in Afghanistan.
