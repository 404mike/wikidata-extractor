MacLachlan was credited with 16 German and Italian aircraft shot down in approximately 250 missions\u20147 were at night of which two were achieved over Malta in 1941 and 5 over France in 1942.\nBorn in Cheshire and educated at Monkton Combe School in Somerset, MacLachlan joined the RAF aged 17 in March 1937. He progressed quickly through flight training and was granted a commission as acting pilot officer on 3 May 1937. He completed his flight training in early 1939 and had considerable time to gain experience in operational types upon the outbreak of the Second World War. When the Battle of France began in May 1940 he was serving with No. 88 Squadron RAF flying the Fairey Battle light bomber he was credited with two enemy aircraft damaged and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).\nSurviving the battle he transferred to fighter pilot school in the summer 1940. During the Battle of Britain he served with No. 73 Squadron RAF and No. 145 Squadron RAF. He achieved a probable victory during the battle. In late 1940 he transferred to Malta in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations and joined No. 261 Squadron RAF. By February 1941 he had achieved eight victories (two at night) and was awarded a Bar to his DFC. MacLachlan was wounded in action on 16 February 1941. His arm was so severely damaged it was amputated, but he returned to operations in November 1941 with an artificial limb.\nMacLachlan joined No. 1 Squadron RAF as squadron leader and led night fighter operations in defence of Britain. In May 1942 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order after claiming five more victories flying with Karel Kuttelwascher. Coupled with the two over Malta it qualified him as a night fighter ace. By July 1942 MacLachlan's tally stood at 13 enemy aircraft shot down including 7 at night. MacLachlan left the squadron for a position at the Air Fighting Development Unit (ADFU). In October 1942 MacLachlan departed to conduct lecturing tours to the United States. He returned to Britain with the ADFU in mid-1943. In June he joined No. 132 Squadron RAF on cross-Channel patrols over Europe. MacLachlan achieved his last 3 victories during these operations\u2014all in one mission\u2014to bring his final tally to 16.\nOn 18 July 1943 the P-51 Mustang in which he was flying was hit by German flak or suffered engine failure and crashed over France. The Germans reported him as a prisoner of war but he died in a military hospital from his injuries. MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC on 30 July 1943 in absentia. During the course of his combat career he flew the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire and P-51 Mustang.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1943", "response": ["**James MacLachlan, British flying ace (b. 1919)"]}, {"page": "Douglas Bader", "response": ["* James MacLachlan, a British Second World War fighter ace with an amputated arm"]}, {"page": "Nose art", "response": ["* James MacLachlan, who flew with an artificial arm, had his Hawker Hurricane adorned with a picture of his amputated arm giving a V sign"]}, {"page": "Monkton Combe School", "response": ["* Squadron Leader James MacLachlan, DSO, DFC & Two Bars, 1919\u20131943, flying ace"]}, {"page": "MacLachlan", "response": ["* James MacLachlan (1919\u20131943), British Royal Air Force pilot and flying ace of the Second World War"]}, {"page": "Joachim M\u00fcncheberg", "response": ["Following a brief stopover in Rome, 7. Staffel arrived in Gela on Sicily on 9 February 1941. Here M\u00fcncheberg received a factory new Bf\u00a0109\u00a0E-7/N with the Werknummer (factory number) 3826 and marked as \"White 12\". He claimed his first victory in the Siege of Malta on 12 February over a No. 261 Squadron Hurricane south of Si\u0121\u0121iewi, Malta. On 16 February M\u00fcncheberg claimed his 26th victory over No. 261 Squadron Hurricane of ace Flight Lieutenant James MacLachlan, who baled out severely wounded. MacLachlan lost his arm, but returned to combat in late 1941. M\u00fcncheberg claimed a slow flying Hurricane\u2014he assumed that the Hurricane had engine trouble\u2014on 25 February. Flying fighter protection for the Stukas, which were targeting the airfield at Luqa, he claimed another Hurricane at 14:06 and another one the following day; the pilot baled out. The seven-victory ace Flying Officer Frederic Frank 'Eric' Taylor DFC was probably M\u00fcncheberg's victory. Taylor was declared missing in action but reported killed when his Mae West lifejacket washed ashore with 20mm cannon shell hole in the chest area. Pilot Officers P Kearsey and C E Langdon were killed in the same battle. M\u00fcncheberg said of Taylor, \"the fighting spirit of the British pilot was fantastic. He tried, although very badly hit, to still attack a Ju 88 [sic].\" M\u00fcncheberg claimed his 33rd victory on 28 March 1941. This was also his 200th combat mission which was celebrated by the entire Staffel."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Page", "response": ["While at the Air Fighting Development Unit Page met Squadron Leader James MacLachlan, a pilot who had lost his left arm after an air-battle over Malta in 1941. Like Page, he had overcome his disability and returned to fly operationally. The AFDU had in their inventory an Allison powered North American Mustang Mark I. MacLachlan came up with the idea of flying an early morning solo low level patrol over occupied France to attack unsuspecting German aircraft from below as they returned to base. His first effort was unsuccessful, but on returning Page asked to try himself. Encouraged by the interest, MacLachlan seized upon the idea of using two aircraft. They set about acquiring a second Mustang, and waited for the correct weather to allow their mission to succeed. On their first sortie south of Paris on 29 June 1943, the pair accounted for six enemy aircraft in ten minutes; three Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft of JG 105, along with a Ju 88 of KG 6. Page was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this action. On their second attempt on 18 July MacLachlan's aircraft was hit as they crossed the coast and he had to make a crash landing. He subsequently died of the injuries he sustained in the crash. Page returned to East Grinstead to remove further scar tissue from one of his hands, and spent several weeks recuperating there."]}]}}
