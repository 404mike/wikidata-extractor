The main focus of the collection is on the art movements which developed in the early and middle decades of the 20th century, art which responded to the influence of the two world wars, and art which challenged the usual and the regular. The collection features a broad base of artists with particularly strong groups of works by William Roberts, Edward Burra, Keith Vaughan, John Tunnard,  John Craxton, and Richard Eurich.

Although three WAAC artists, Edward Bawden, Barnett Freedman and Edward Ardizzone, had been part of the British Expeditionary Force's retreat from France in 1940, the works they produced were small-scale representations of events in their immediate surroundings. WAAC therefore, quickly, commissioned two artists, Cundall and Richard Eurich to produce large panoramic reconstructions of the evacuation. As neither artist had witnessed the events at Dunkirk, they relied on published accounts, photographs, eyewitness reports and their own imaginations, to make their compositions. The two finished paintings were shown side by side at the National Gallery in August 1940. The two treatments were very different, and both had their critics and supporters. Most newspaper art critics, and Kenneth Clark, preferred Eurichs' symmetrical, more classical composition and criticised Cundall for having put too much unresolved detail into his picture, which seemed confused and unruly in places. The Royal Navy reproduced Eurich's painting on its official 1940 Christmas card, but many newspapers also reproduced a Ministry of Information photograph showing two servicemen at the National Gallery seemingly recognising elements of Cundall's composition. This helped create a reputation of authenticity for Cundall's work which has persisted."]}, {"page": "Hunting Art Prize", "response": ["*1981: Hans Schwarz for \"Wills Neck, Quantocks\" (watercolour); Richard Eurich for \"Weymouth Bay 1980\" (oil)"]}, {"page": "Margaret Firth", "response": ["After leaving Art School Margaret was encouraged to continue painting by her father. He built her a large studio at their home 'Bracken Wood'. Margaret continued to work to develop her technique but for the next twenty years she struggled to find time to paint. Unlike her contemporaries from the School of Art John Cooper, John Bickerdike and Richard Eurich, Margaret never considered leaving home for London to establish her career. In the mid-1920s Margaret was commissioned to design interiors for homes which provided a financial income. In the late 1930s Margaret's brother became seriously ill and the health of her mother's health worsened. Margaret's painted ceased altogether. Her brother died in 1940 followed by her mother in 1942. Margaret worked at the Hospital Support Depot in Ilkey to contribute to the war effort. When Edwin Firth died in 1948 Margaret was left alone, aged 50, with no family and few friends. She sold the family home and moved into an attic flat. The flat had a spare room which Margaret turned into a studio to begin to paint again."]}, {"page": "Leonard Daniels", "response": ["In 1948, Daniels was appointed principal of the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts.

Daniels became Camberwell's longest serving principal and was responsible for recruiting several leading artists to teach, part-time, at the college. Thesse included Edward Ardizzone, Claude Rogers, Victor Passmore, William Coldstream and Richard Eurich. Daniels, supported by a Leverhulme bursary, spent time at the British School of Rome in 1957. Daniels was active in the National Society of Art Education and in 1965 he was elected President of the Society. Daniels retired from Camberwell in 1975, but continued to paint and, on occasion, teach part-time. Daniels died in 1998, shortly before a retrospective exhibition of his work opened at Winchester Cathedral."]}, {"page": "Eurich, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Eurich"]}]}}
