In his book The Scientific Attitude (1941), he touched on political topics such as central planning, and praised Marxism as a \"profound scientific philosophy\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson", "response": ["On Growth and Form has inspired thinkers including the biologists Julian Huxley, Conrad Hal Waddington and Stephen Jay Gould, the mathematician Alan Turing, the anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and artists including Richard Hamilton, Eduardo Paolozzi, and Ben Nicholson with his ideas on the mathematical basis of the forms of animals, and perhaps especially on morphogenesis. Jackson Pollock owned a copy. Waddington and other developmental biologists were struck particularly by the chapter on Thompson's \"Theory of Transformations\", where he showed that the various shapes of related species (such as of fish) could be presented as geometric transformations, anticipating the evolutionary developmental biology of a century later."]}, {"page": "Organicism", "response": ["In the early 1930s Joseph Henry Woodger and Joseph Needham, together with Conrad Hal Waddington, John Desmond Bernal, Dorothy Needham, and Dorothy Wrinch, formed the Theoretical Biology Club, to promote the organicist approach to biology. The club was in opposition to mechanism, reductionism and the gene-centric view of evolution. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead.Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J.
