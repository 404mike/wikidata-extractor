Unsurprisingly, as a local man and former city mayor, Goddard polled 167 votes more than his running mate, Soames. Three years later, Goddard and Soames had another opportunity to unseat the Conservatives at the 1895 general election.

At the 1900 general election, Goddard sought re-election and this time had a new Liberal running mate in Noel Buxton. Goddard again topped the poll but again, the sitting Conservative MP came second ahead of Buxton. For the 1906 general election, Goddard stood again as Liberal candidate and again with a new Liberal running mate in Felix Cobbold. Unlike Soames and Buxton, Cobbold had stronger ties to Ipswich, making him a better fit as  candidate. Goddard and Cobbold were both easily elected in the year of the Liberal landslide. Once again, Goddard topped the poll. ", "His Ipswich colleague Felix Cobbold died in December 1909 just weeks before the January 1910 general election. The Liberals selected Silvester Horne to run with Goddard at the election. Both seats were retained with Goddard at the top of the poll.
