Jephson was a right-handed middle order batsman. But his enduring fame rests on his reputation as one of the last lob bowlers, bowling slow right-arm underarm lobs. His action was described as a little like setting a wood in crown green bowling. In fact, he started as an overarm right-handed fast bowler, but switched to lobs with great success when he took up regular county cricket in the late 1890s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Underarm bowling", "response": ["Others famous \"lobsters\" include Digby Jephson.

In those days, the convention was that the captain had to be an amateur, and Surrey were unable to find one willing to do the job who had greater experience or who was a stronger player.

Leicestershire were forced to follow-on in their second-innings, this time making an improved 385, although Hudson only contributed a single run before he was bowled by Digby Jephson.
