He held a variety of prominent positions within the game of football, including Chairman of The Football Association's International Committee and vice-president of the F.A.Swales became Manchester City chairman in 1973, with the club in a reasonably strong position and regularly challenging at the top of the Football League with clubs such as Liverpool, Leeds United and Derby County. Swales presided over a general decline in City's fortunes, which was exacerbated by numerous controversial decisions. After two decades, frustration grew, and Swales was ousted by Francis Lee after a long protest by City supporters, famously known as \"Forward with Franny\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trevor Francis", "response": ["The injury kept Francis out of the game for over six months. He was sold to Manchester City in September 1981, this time for \u00a31.2\u00a0million. The deal caused behind-the-scenes friction at Manchester City. During negotiations City chairman Peter Swales informed manager John Bond that the club could not afford the transfer fee. Bond then issued an ultimatum: if Francis did not sign, Bond would resign. Francis made a promising start at the club, scoring two goals against Stoke City on his debut, but over the course of the season he was frequently injured. In total he scored 12 goals in 26 games and made the England squad for the 1982 World Cup."]}, {"page": "Francis Lee (footballer)", "response": ["In 1994, Lee became chairman of Manchester City, ousting Peter Swales from the position by purchasing \u00a33 million of shares at a price of \u00a313.35 per share. Lee was welcomed as a hero by City's supporters, who had formed a movement named Forward With Franny backing his attempt to gain control of the club. Upon becoming chairman, Lee made a series of extravagant claims about his plans for the club, announcing that \"This will be the happiest club in the land. The players will be the best paid and we'll drink plenty of champagne, celebrate and sing until we're hoarse\". In 1995, he appointed his friend Alan Ball as manager, but the appointment proved unsuccessful and the club were relegated. Lee stepped down in 1998, with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football, a fate which Lee had dismissed at the previous annual general meeting by saying that he would \"jump off the Kippax\" if the club were relegated. He was succeeded by David Bernstein. Lee retained a shareholding after leaving the board of directors but later sold all his shares to Thaksin Shinawatra."]}, {"page": "Colin Bell", "response": ["In the 1970\u201371 season, Bell scored thirteen goals for City who finished eleventh in the First Division. In the following season, City challenged for the title but ultimately lost out to Derby County and finished fourth in the league. Bell scored thirteen goals that season. In the 1972\u201373 season, City finished eleventh in the league. In the 1973\u201374 season, Bell helped City reach the 1974 Football League Cup Final, in which he scored in a 2\u20131 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Bell played for City in a 1\u20130 victory against Manchester United in the final game of the season. Denis Law scored the only goal in the game which confirmed United's relegation from the First Division. In the 1974\u201375 season, Bell scored fifteen league goals. He was named in the 1974\u201375 Football League First Division PFA Team of the Year. In November 1975, at the age of 29, Bell severely injured his right knee against Manchester United in a challenge with Martin Buchan during a League Cup match at Maine Road. City went on to win the League Cup that season, defeating Newcastle 2\u20131 in the 1976 Football League Cup Final. Bell's prolonged absence due to his injury was a blow to Don Revie, who quit as manager of England in 1977. Bell returned to action in a 4\u20130 victory against Newcastle on Boxing Day in 1977. His introduction to the game, at half time, was greeted with rapturous applause. However, Bell's return to City was fleeting as he left City in the 1978\u201379 season; Malcolm Allison, who returned to City for a second spell as manager in 1979, convinced Bell that it was time to go. The then-chairman Peter Swales described Bell as the \"finest tuned athlete\" and \"irreplaceable\". This latter sentiment turned out to be true as Allison was not able to find a trio of talented players of the calibre of Bell, Summerbee and Lee as he had done in the past with Joe Mercer. Bell tried to resurrect his career in 1980 with NASL side San Jose Earthquakes, where he joined former Manchester United player George Best.

Horton initially told chairman Peter Swales that \"we have the makings, the backbone of a really good squad\" and that he was satisfied in not making many additions if it meant keeping hold of the existing squad; he cancelled a pre-arranged sale of Steve Lomas to Preston North End.

But then Horton transformed his attack by signing Uwe R\u00f6sler (N\u00fcrnberg), Paul Walsh (\u00a3750,000 from Portsmouth) and Peter Beagrie (\u00a31.1 million from Everton), and City escaped relegation after losing only two of their last 14 games of the season."]}, {"page": "Paul Lake", "response": ["He returned for pre-season training in June 1992, and he played in a number of pre-season friendlies without incident, though his knee still required a lengthy period of rest after matches.

He started the opening Premier League game of the 1992\u201393 season on 17 August, a 1\u20131 draw with Queens Park Rangers, but was substituted 60 minutes in after feeling pressure in his knee. Despite still feeling that his knee needed rest he went on to play against Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park two days later. Ten minutes into the game his ligament snapped for the third time and he was substituted off. Six weeks later he travelled to Los Angeles to see Dr Sisto, an expert on cruciate ligament injuries. Before going on the trip he told The Sunday People that the club and chairman Peter Swales had not handled his injury in the correct manner and left him feeling like \"a piece of meat\" as players at other clubs received specialist treatment straight away and received appearance and bonus pay during long-term absences. Despite Lake being alone in America, the club refused to pay for his girlfriend to fly out to LA to be with him during his recovery from surgery, and so Niall Quinn and Peter Reid organised a whip-round to pay for her flight tickets.

Book managed the club for five years, winning the League Cup in 1976.
