His publications include Problems of the Self (1973), Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (1985), Shame and Necessity (1993), and Truth and Truthfulness (2002). He was knighted in 1999.\nAs Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, Williams became known for his efforts to reorient the study of moral philosophy to psychology, history, and in particular to the Greeks. Described by Colin McGinn as an \"analytical philosopher with the soul of a general humanist,\" he was sceptical about attempts to create a foundation for moral philosophy. Martha Nussbaum wrote that he demanded of philosophy that it \"come to terms with, and contain, the difficulty and complexity of human life.\"Williams was a strong supporter of women in academia; according to Nussbaum, he was \"as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be.\" He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams's mentors at Oxford, said that he \"understands what you're going to say better than you understand it yourself, and sees all the possible objections to it, and all the possible answers to all the possible objections, before you've got to the end of your own sentence.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Consequentialism", "response": ["Bernard Williams has argued that consequentialism is alienating because it requires moral agents to put too much distance between themselves and their own projects and commitments. Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since it is only the consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents\u2014since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or not someone is personally the author of a particular consequence. For example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation.Smart, J. J. C., and Bernard Williams. 1973. Utilitarianism: For and Against. Cambridge University Press. pp. 98 ff."]}, {"page": "Cogito, ergo sum", "response": ["In Descartes, The Project of Pure Enquiry, Bernard Williams provides a history and full evaluation of this issue. The first to raise the \"I\" problem was Pierre Gassendi, who in his , as noted by Saul Fisher \"points out that recognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is a particular thinker or another. \u2026[T]he only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim that there is cognitive activity present.\"Fisher, Saul. [2005] 2013. \"Pierre Gassendi\" (revised ed.). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved 17 June 2020.", "Bernard Williams claims that what we are dealing with when we talk of thought, or when we say \"I am thinking,\" is something conceivable from a third-person perspective\u2014namely objective \"thought-events\" in the former case, and an objective thinker in the latter. He argues, first, that it is impossible to make sense of \"there is thinking\" without relativizing it to something. However, this something cannot be Cartesian egos, because it is impossible to differentiate objectively between things just on the basis of the pure content of consciousness. The obvious problem is that, through introspection, or our experience of consciousness, we have no way of moving to conclude the existence of any third-personal fact, to conceive of which would require something above and beyond just the purely subjective contents of the mind."]}, {"page": "Ethics", "response": ["The word ethics in English refers to several things. It can refer to philosophical ethics or moral philosophy\u2014a project that attempts to use reason to answer various kinds of ethical questions. As the English moral philosopher Bernard Williams writes, attempting to explain moral philosophy: \"What makes an inquiry a philosophical one is reflective generality and a style of argument that claims to be rationally persuasive.\" Williams describes the content of this area of inquiry as addressing the very broad question, \"how one should live\". Ethics can also refer to a common human ability to think about ethical problems that is not particular to philosophy. As bioethicist Larry Churchill has written: \"Ethics, understood as the capacity to think critically about moral values and direct our actions in terms of such values, is a generic human capacity.\" Ethics can also be used to describe a particular person's own idiosyncratic principles or habits. For example: \"Joe has strange ethics.\" Ethics is a normative science."]}, {"page": "England", "response": ["In response to the Industrial Revolution, agrarian writers sought a way between liberty and tradition; William Cobbett, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc were main exponents, while the founder of guild socialism, Arthur Penty, and cooperative movement advocate G. D. H. Cole are somewhat related.. Empiricism continued through John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell, while Bernard Williams was involved in analytics. Authors from around the Victorian era include Charles Dickens, the Bront\u00eb sisters, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells and Lewis Carroll.. Since then England has continued to produce novelists such as George Orwell, D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, C. S. Lewis, Enid Blyton, Aldous Huxley, Agatha Christie, Terry Pratchett, J. R. R. Tolkien, and J. K. Rowling.."]}, {"page": "Friedrich Nietzsche", "response": ["A decade after World War II, there was a revival of Nietzsche's philosophical writings thanks to translations and analyses by Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale. Georges Bataille was also influential in this revival, defending Nietzsche against appropriation by the Nazis with his notable 1937 essay \"Nietzsche and Fascists\". Others, well known philosophers in their own right, wrote commentaries on Nietzsche's philosophy, including Martin Heidegger, who produced a four-volume study, and Lev Shestov, who wrote a book called Dostoyevski, Tolstoy and Nietzsche where he portrays Nietzsche and Dostoyevski as the \"thinkers of tragedy\". Georg Simmel compares Nietzsche's importance to ethics to that of Copernicus for cosmology. Sociologist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies read Nietzsche avidly from his early life, and later frequently discussed many of his concepts in his own works. Nietzsche has influenced philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Oswald Spengler, George Grant, Emil Cioran, Albert Camus, Ayn Rand, Jacques Derrida,Derrida, J. & Attridge, D. (1992). Sarah Kofman, Leo Strauss, Max Scheler, Michel Foucault, Bernard Williams, and Nick Land. Camus described Nietzsche as \"the only artist to have derived the extreme consequences of an aesthetics of the absurd\". Paul Ric\u0153ur called Nietzsche one of the masters of the \"school of suspicion\", alongside Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. Carl Jung was also influenced by Nietzsche. In Memories, Dreams, Reflections, a biography transcribed by his secretary, he cites Nietzsche as a large influence. Aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy, especially his ideas of the self and his relation to society, run through much of late-twentieth and early twenty-first century thought.Belliotti, Raymond A. 2013. Jesus or Nietzsche: How Should We Live Our Lives? Rodopi.Kuipers, Ronald A. 2011. \"Turning Memory into Prophecy: Roberto Unger and Paul Ricoeur on the Human Condition Between Past and Future.\" The Heythrop Journal (2011):1\u201310. Nietzsche's writings have also been influential to some advancers of Accelerationist thought through his influence on Deleuze and Guattari. His deepening of the romantic-heroic tradition of the nineteenth century, for example, as expressed in the ideal of the \"grand striver\" appears in the work of thinkers from Cornelius Castoriadis to Roberto Mangabeira Unger.Rorty, Richard. [1987] 1988. \"Unger, Castoriadis, and the Romance of a National Future.\" Northwestern University Law Review 82: 39. For Nietzsche, this grand striver overcomes obstacles, engages in epic struggles, pursues new goals, embraces recurrent novelty, and transcends existing structures and contexts."]}, {"page": "Gilles Deleuze", "response": ["Gilles Deleuze (; ; 18 January 1925\u00a0\u2013 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1950s until his death in 1995, wrote on philosophy, literature, film, and fine art. His most popular works were the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand Plateaus (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst F\u00e9lix Guattari.  His metaphysical treatise Difference and Repetition (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus. See also: \"Difference and Repetition is definitely the most important work published by Deleuze.\" (Edouard Morot-Sir, from the back cover of the first edition of the English translation), or James Williams' judgment: \"It is nothing less than a revolution in philosophy and stands out as one of the great philosophical works of the twentieth century\" (James Williams, Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition: A Critical Introduction and Guide [Edinburgh UP, 2003], p. 1). An important part of Deleuze's oeuvre is devoted to the reading of other philosophers: the Stoics, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, and Bergson, with particular influence derived from Spinoza.Macherey, Pierre (1998), 'Deleuze in Spinoza'. In: Warren Montag  (ed.), In A Materialist Way: Selected Essays by Pierre Macherey. (New York: Verso, 1998) A. W. Moore, citing Bernard Williams's criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the \"greatest philosophers\".A. W. Moore,  The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 543: 'intellectual power and depth; a grasp of the sciences; a sense of the political, and of human destructiveness as well as creativity; a broad range and a fertile imagination; an unwillingness to settle for the superficially reassuring; and, in an unusually lucky case, the gifts of a great writer.' Although he once characterized himself as a \"pure metaphysician\",Beaulieu, Alain; Kazarian, Edward; Sushytska, Julia (eds.): Gilles Deleuze and Metaphysics. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2014) his work has influenced a variety of disciplines across the humanities, including philosophy, art, and literary theory, as well as movements such as post-structuralism and postmodernism.See, for example, Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, Postmodern Theory (Guilford Press, 1991), which devotes a chapter to Deleuze and Guattari."]}, {"page": "Internalism and externalism", "response": ["There is also a distinction in ethics and action theory, largely made popular by Bernard Williams (1979, reprinted in 1981), concerning internal and external reasons for an action.  An internal reason is, roughly, something that one has in light of one's own \"subjective motivational set\"\u2014one's own commitments, desires (or wants), goals, etc. On the other hand, an external reason is something that one has independent of one's subjective motivational set.  For example, suppose that Sally is going to drink a glass of poison, because she wants to commit suicide and believes that she can do so by drinking the poison.  Sally has an internal reason to drink the poison, because she wants to commit suicide.  However, one might say that she has an external reason not to drink the poison because, even though she wants to die, one ought not kill oneself no matter what\u2014regardless of whether one wants to die.", "Some philosophers embrace the existence of both kinds of reason, while others deny the existence of one or the other. For example, Bernard Williams (1981) argues that there are really only internal reasons for action. Such a view is called internalism about reasons (or reasons internalism). Externalism about reasons (or reasons externalism) is the denial of reasons internalism.Finlay, Stephen & Schroeder, Mark (2008). \"Reasons for Action: Internal vs. External\" (\u00a71.1). The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Edward N. Zalta (ed.)) It is the view that there are external reasons for action; that is, there are reasons for action that one can have even if the action is not part of one's subjective motivational set."]}, {"page": "June 10", "response": ["*  2003   \u2013 Bernard Williams, English philosopher and academic (b. 1929)"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Bernard Williams"]}, {"page": "Naturalistic fallacy", "response": ["Bernard Williams called Moore's use of the term naturalistic fallacy, a \"spectacular misnomer\", the question being metaphysical, as opposed to rational."]}, {"page": "Political philosophy", "response": ["* Bernard Williams: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy In the Beginning was the Deed has been seen\u2014along with the works of Raymond Geuss\u2014as a key foundational work on political realism."]}]}}
