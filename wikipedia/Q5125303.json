In the days before the opera companies had young artists\u2019 programmes, British Youth Opera was conceived as a \u2018bridge\u2019 organisation, to offer young singers performance opportunities in a fully professional but nurturing environment, in which they could train on the job and perform before a paying audience of the public, and before industry professionals whose influence could help them in their ongoing careers. Alumni have gone on to advanced training courses at the Royal Opera House and the National Opera Studio, and to professional careers.
