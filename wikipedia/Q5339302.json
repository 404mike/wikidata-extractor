Women had been elected members and chairmen of the existing vestries and district boards, and it followed that they could be elected to the new councils. Mr Boulnois believed that the work of the councils would be \"distasteful to women\" and that it would be \"a pity to drag women into the turmoil of an election on political lines\". He reminded members \"If they allowed women to sit on these councils they would not be able to withhold from them the Parliamentary franchise and the right to sit and vote in that house.\" The amendment was carried with a majority of 102.The Times, 28 April 1899 This was not the end of the issue, however.
