Bishop (born 31 October 1960), also known by the nickname of \"Bish\", is a Welsh former dual-code international rugby union and then rugby league footballer. As a scrum-half in rugby union, he made his first-class d\u00e9but for Ebbw Vale where he was outstanding. He then joined Pontypool in 1981, but not long after broke his neck. Despite being told he would never play again, he was back playing for Pontypool within a year. He only gained one cap for Wales \u2013 against Australia during the 1984 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland which Wales lost 28\u20139. Despite the loss Bishop was the only player to score a try against them.Bishop had played understudy to fellow scrum-half Terry Holmes, and when Holmes switched codes to rugby league in 1985, many expected Bishop to finally be given his chance to play for Wales permanently. However, during a match versus Newbridge, Chris Jarman received a broken jaw in an off-the ball incident. Jarman brought a private prosecution resulting in Bishop being given a suspended jail sentence and an eleven-month ban by the WRU. The Welsh selectors instead picked Robert Jones of Swansea RFC. Bishop however gained his revenge in 1987-88 when Pontypool defeated Swansea at Pontypool Park in the cup, the highlight of the game being Bishop's penalty in the mud to seal the win, following which Bishop wiggled his rear end to the stand\u2014where the Welsh selectors were sitting.\nDespite repeatedly putting in outstanding performances for Pontypool, Bishop was never picked for Wales again, though his case was not helped by several of Bishop's antics off the field. The 1987-1988 season was the most successful in the club's history when they lost only two games all season and Bishop formed a potent partnership with Mark Ring. Finally in 1988 Bishop was lured to rugby league and he signed for Hull Kingston Rovers, and subsequently played for Salford and London Crusaders. He was then part of the Wales rugby league team that won a European Nations Cup and reached the 1995 Rugby League World Cup's semi-finals.When rugby union became openly professional in 1995, Bishop returned to Pontypool as player-coach. Although Pontypool had been relegated from the top flight of rugby in Wales in 1995. Two highlights during this period were saving Pontypool from relegation from Division 1 with a victory over UWIC and the 16\u201315 win over Neath RFC in the Welsh Cup in 1999. Pontypool then played Cardiff in the next round of the cup, where they were heavily defeated, but Bishop faced his old adversary Robert Jones for the last time.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Ring", "response": ["A great entertainer, Ring was noted for his cheek, flair and individual skill. He first came to attention as outside half for the Cardiff RFC Youth team where he gained selection for Wales Youth, scoring a try on debut v England. He made his senior debut as an 18-year-old during his Youth season against Cote Des Basques in Biarritz for whom Serge Blanco scored three tries. He played in and won three Welsh Cup Finals and played for Cardiff when they defeated the 1984 Australian Tourists who completed the Grand Slam of Tests but yet again, failed to defeat a Cardiff team who still remain unbeaten against every Australian Touring team who ever crossed these shores. He became a great crowd favourite with his hometown club but also spent a few seasons at Pontypool where he formed a notable half back partnership with David Bishop in 1987\u201388. He returned to Pontypool in 1992. He was a Club Championship winner for both Cardiff and Pontypool. He played more than 250 games for Cardiff and scored 94 tries and 677 points."]}, {"page": "David Bishop (rugby union, born 1983)", "response": ["David Bishop (born 22 September 1983) is a former Wales rugby union footballer who plays at centre."]}, {"page": "David Bishop", "response": ["David Bishop may refer to:", "*David Bishop (writer) (born 1966), New Zealand novelist, playwright and comics writer", "*David Bishop (runner) (born 1987), British Scottish international middle-distance athlete", "*David Bishop (gymnast) (born 1990), New Zealand artistic gymnast", "*David Bishop (rugby, born 1960), Welsh international rugby player during the 1980s", "*David Bishop (rugby union, born 1983), Welsh rugby union player", "*David Bishop (Neighbours), fictional character in Australian TV series Neighbours", "*David Bishop (British politician), leader of the Church of the Militant Elvis Party", "*David Bishop (Canadian politician) (1942\u20132017), Canadian politician and member of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick", "*David Bishop (American politician) (1929-2020), American lawyer, politician and member of the Minnesota House of Representatives"]}, {"page": "British baseball", "response": ["Welsh Rugby players Viv Huzzey, Terry Holmes, Mark Ring, David Bishop, and Wigan Rugby League legend and record points scorer Jim Sullivan all played the sport, often during rugby's off season."]}, {"page": "Glen Webbe", "response": ["Webbe has spoken of his experiences as one of the first black players in Welsh rugby, commenting on racism in association football, Webbe said he believed rugby was \"far more tolerant, (but) can\u2019t be complacent\".
