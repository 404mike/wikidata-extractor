This was the very first time any part of Sandwell had elected a Conservative MP \u2013 or indeed an MP from any party other than Labour. In the December 2019 general election, however, Conservative candidates Nicola Richards and Shaun Bailey were elected to represent West Bromwich East and West Bromwich West respectively. This was the first time since the borough's creation that West Bromwich has returned any Conservative MPs to Parliament, and the first time that a constituency fully within the boundaries of Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council has been represented by a Tory MP. The election of both Richards and Bailey has been marked as a significant milestone in the political history of the borough and marked the end to decades of control by Labour MPs."]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in England and Wales", "response": ["| James Morris, MP"]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in Northern Ireland", "response": ["#Vice-Chamberlain of the Household (James Morris MP)"]}, {"page": "Halesowen", "response": ["Historically an exclave of Shropshire and, from 1844, in Worcestershire, the town is around  from Birmingham city centre, and  from Dudley town centre.
