Used as a form of cheap labour to carry out menial tasks, he was dismissed when the apprenticeship ended in 1926. Roberts inherited his mother's love of reading and socialist politics; while he spent the next three years unemployed, he attended evening classes to study foreign languages and social history.\nIn 1929, he was hired as a tutor at a commercial college. A staunch internationalist, he was dismissed from this job in 1940 when he was exempted as a conscientious objector from military service in the Second World War. After a short period teaching in Liverpool, he spent most of the 1940s and the 1950s working on a relative's farm in Yorkshire while teaching adult education classes and writing for the radio and newspapers. In 1957, he was hired as an education officer at Strangeways Prison in Manchester where he taught illiterate prisoners to read and write, experiences which formed the basis of his first book, Imprisoned Tongues (1968).\nIn 1971, Roberts followed this up with The Classic Slum, an account of his upbringing in Edwardian Salford which he intermixed with social and oral history. Roberts produced the book to counter what he felt were romantic conceptions of the working-class community in post-war sociological and social history studies; while emphasising the strength of many individual characters, his book highlighted the pervasive and often devastating effects of poverty, as well as the complex status distinctions and conservatism this produced among residents in his \"slum\". Widely praised on its release, this richly textured account has become a key source for understanding working-class experience in early-20th-century England. Two years later, Roberts moved to Hampshire where he died in 1974. His autobiography, A Ragged Schooling, was published posthumously; also praised, it was a more personal account of his childhood, teenage and early adult years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Roberts", "response": ["*Robert Roberts (Queensland politician) (1869\u20131934), Australian politician for East Toowoomba between 1912 and 1934", "*Robert Roberts (American politician) (1848\u20131939), mayor of Burlington, Vermont", "*Robert Roberts (footballer, born 1864) (1864\u20131932), Bolton Wanderers F.C., Preston North End F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*Robert Roberts (footballer, born 1865) (1865\u20131945), Rhosllanerchrugog, Crewe Alexandra F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*Robert Roberts (footballer, born 1892) (1892\u2013?), Manchester United F.C. footballer", "*Robert Roberts (rugby league) (1912\u20131979), rugby league footballer of the 1930s and 1940s", "*Robert Roberts (cardiologist), Canadian cardiologist", "*Robert Roberts (priest) (1680\u20131741), Welsh cleric and writer", "*Robert Roberts (butler) (1780\u20131860), author of The House Servant's Directory: A Monitor for Private Families", "*Robert Roberts (Christadelphian) (1839\u20131898), Scottish journalist, writer and preacher", "*Robert Roberts (author) (1905\u20131974), British author of The Classic Slum", "*Silyn Roberts (Robert Roberts, 1871\u20131930), Welsh-language author"]}, {"page": "List of people from Salford", "response": ["* Robert Roberts, author"]}, {"page": "Wikipedia talk:WikiProject United Kingdom", "response": ["== Robert Roberts (author) at FAC in need of reviews ==", "Hi all, a few weeks ago I nominated Robert Roberts (author) at WP:FAC and unfortunately I've yet to have any reviews.

I'd argue that any book which has received several (5+) good, lengthy reviews in major newspapers or academic journals probably meets that threshold. Whether articles on them should be created, and when, are other questions. Many noteworthy authors and topics currently lack articles or have very undeveloped ones and it might be better to direct attention at them before moving on to books themselves. Also, for authors who have written, say, two books, it can sometimes be more useful to combine discussion of their books with their biographical article, as I have done at Robert Roberts (author). This really only works when we're dealing with maybe two or three notable books though. Otherwise, forking is probably better."]}]}}
