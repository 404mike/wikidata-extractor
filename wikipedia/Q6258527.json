Edmunds had a privileged upbringing and was privately educated, but was diagnosed with hysteria in her early twenties. It was while she was living with her widowed mother in Brighton, in the late 1860s, that Edmunds became involved with the local doctor, Charles Beard. The nature of their relationship remains a source of controversy but, in September 1870, Edmunds poisoned Dr Beard's wife by giving her a poisoned chocolate cream. However, Mrs Beard recovered from the resulting violent illness. Dr Beard said later that he suspected Edmunds had poisoned his wife at that time, but did not act on his suspicion, due to a lack of proof and a concern over the taint of scandal.Kaye Jones, 'The Case of the Chocolate Cream Killer: The Poisonous Passion of Christiana Edmunds, (Barnsley, Pen & Sword, 2016)."]}, {"page": "John Bruckner", "response": ["In 1752 an elder of the Norwich Walloon church that leased the church of St. Mary the Less,  seeking a successor to Michel Olivier Vallotton as pastor,John Southerden Burn, The history of the French, Walloon, Dutch and other foreign Protestant refugees settled in England (1846), p. 77; online. recruited Bruckner, who could preach in Latin, Dutch, French, and English; and he came in Norwich in 1753.
