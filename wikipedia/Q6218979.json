He was very unassuming, of social disposition, and noted for his benevolence. He died 24 December 1832 of inflammation of the brain. His large work, \u2018Historical and Genealogical Memoirs of the House of Hamilton,\u2019 in quarto, was published at Edinburgh in 1825; a supplement was issued in 1827. For twenty-nine years before his death Anderson was engaged upon a \u2018Statistical History of Lanarkshire,\u2019 and also upon a \u2018Genealogical History of the Robertsons of Struan,\u2019 but neither of these works appears to have been printed.", "link_mentions": {}}}
