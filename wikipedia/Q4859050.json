Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against euthanasia and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When the police do not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is imprisoned for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom.", "Author Dorothy Hobson has discussed the use of older female characters in British soap opera as a means of providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in EastEnders to the trio of Ena Sharples, Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst from Coronation Street with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at EastEnders attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of \"'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series.\" An example of this was the character Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) who appeared between 1998 and 1999.  The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because \"far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', there is a need for unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience.\" Brown has spoken about the \"wonderful rapport\" she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, \"I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and stop us working together at one time, but the producer changed and it all went back to where it started.\""]}, {"page": "2005 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 25 October \u2013 Barbara Keogh, actress (born 1929)"]}, {"page": "Fall of Eagles", "response": ["*Barbara Keogh \u2013 Barbara (Yakovleva)"]}, {"page": "The Rag Trade", "response": ["| Guest Stars: George Roderick, Barbara Keogh and Jean Conroy"]}, {"page": "Shadows (TV series)", "response": ["Starring: Alex McCrindle, Barbara Keogh, Hannah Isaacson, Joan Scott, Karen Archer, Pat Beckett, Andrew Paul"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2005", "response": ["*Barbara Keogh, 76, British actress."]}, {"page": "List of former EastEnders characters", "response": ["|Lilly Mattock || Barbara Keogh || 1998\u20131999"]}, {"page": "The Grimleys", "response": ["Other domestic characters are their older sister Lisa Grimley (Corrieann Fletcher) and their Nan (Barbara Keogh), who seems to be obsessed with the \"Grimley curse\".

A few weeks later, Dot is seen moving into the house of Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), citing irreconcilable differences with Lilly. The decision to axe Lilly was reportedly prompted by actress June Brown, who plays Dot Cotton. Brown had allegedly complained that the comedy double act between Dot and Lilly was not right. A BBC insider told The People newspaper \"[Dot and Lilly were] supposed to be two pensioners providing comedy scenes but June thought it was rubbish.
