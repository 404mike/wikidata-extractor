Only later, in The Danube in Prehistory (1929), did Childe give \"culture\" a specifically archaeological definition. In this book, he defined a \"culture\" as a set of \"regularly associated traits\" in the material culture\u2014i.e. \"pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites, house forms\"\u2014that recur across a given area. He said that in this respect a \"culture\" was the archaeological equivalent of a \"people\". Childe's use of the term was non-racial; he considered a \"people\" to be a social grouping, not a biological race. He opposed the equation of archaeological cultures with biological races\u2014as various nationalists across Europe were doing at the time\u2014and vociferously criticised Nazi uses of archaeology, arguing that the Jewish people were not a distinct biological race but a socio-cultural grouping. In 1935, he suggested that culture worked as a \"living functioning organism\" and emphasised the adaptive potential of material culture; in this he was influenced by anthropological functionalism. Childe accepted that archaeologists defined \"cultures\" based on a subjective selection of material criteria; this view was later widely adopted by archaeologists like Colin Renfrew.", "The processual archaeologist Colin Renfrew described Childe as \"one of the fathers of processual thought\" due to his \"development of economic and social themes in prehistory\", an idea echoed by Faulkner. Trigger argued that Childe's work foreshadowed processual thought in two ways: by emphasising the role of change in societal development, and by adhering to a strictly materialist view of the past. Both of these arose from Childe's Marxism. Despite this connection, most American processualists ignored Childe's work, seeing him as a particularist who was irrelevant to their search for generalised laws of societal behaviour. In keeping with Marxist thought, Childe did not agree that such generalised laws exist, believing behaviour is not universal but conditioned by socio-economic factors. Peter Ucko, one of Childe's successors as director of the Institute of Archaeology, highlighted that Childe accepted the subjectivity of archaeological interpretation, something in stark contrast to the processualists' insistence that archaeological interpretation could be objective.
