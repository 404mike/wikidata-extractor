Middle Eastern methods of cooking, which sometimes combined meats, fruits and spices, were popular at the time.  Pies were created from such mixtures of sweet and savoury foods; in Tudor England, shrid pies (as they were known then) were formed from shredded meat, suet and dried fruit. The addition of spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg was, according to the English antiquary John Timbs, \"in token of the offerings of the Eastern Magi.\"  Several authors, including Timbs, viewed the pie as being derived from an old Roman custom practised during Saturnalia, where Roman fathers in the Vatican were presented with sweetmeats.  Early pies were much larger than those consumed today, and oblong shaped; the jurist John Selden presumed that \"the coffin of our Christmas-Pies, in shape long, is in Imitation of the Cratch [Jesus's crib]\", although writer T. F. Thistleton-Dyer thought Selden's explanation unlikely, as \"in old English cookery books the crust of a pie is generally called 'the coffin'.\""]}, {"page": "The Illustrated London News", "response": ["*1842\u20131848: Frederick William Naylor BayleyGraham Law (2001), Victorian Fiction Research Guide 29 , The University of Queensland.

Whereas John Nichols in his History of Lambeth Parish conjectures that she was the widow of Guy Fawkes, executed in 1606, John Timbs in his 1867 Curiosities of London states for a fact that there was no such connection, and that the Vaux name derives from one Falkes de Breaut\u00e9, a mercenary working for King John who acquired the land by marriage. Jane is stated to be the widow of John, a vintner.
