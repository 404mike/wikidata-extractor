Robert Boyle, later Boyle-Walsingham (1736\u20131780) and wife (m. 1759) Charlotte Hanbury Williams (d. 1790), daughter of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams and Lady Frances Coningsby. Her paternal grandparents were Henry Boyle, 1st Earl of Shannon and his second wife Lady Henrietta Boyle.\nShe spent most of her childhood with her parents at the Boyle Farm mansion in Thames Ditton. (Her mother, the second daughter of Frances Coningsby, had bought this estate in 1784 from Lord Hertford, who was grieving over the death of his wife there two years earlier.) Charlotte did much artistic decoration in Boyle Farm and much of it has survived to the present day.\nIn London on 3/4 August 1791, more than a year after her mother's death, Charlotte married Lord Henry FitzGerald, a member of the Duke of Leinster's family. After petitioning King George III in 1790, she eventually (in 1806) was able to end the abeyance to the Barony of de Ros, the most ancient baronial title in England, in her favor.  This was accomplished despite her being determined only one of the three co-heirs to the barony with only a twenty-five percent interest whereas another claimant, Sir Henry Hunloke, 4th Bt., had a fifty percent interest and was the heir general of the elder of the two sisters from whom the claims were derived.  No clear explanation for the award was given by the House of Lords except an inference that Charlotte came from (or at least had married into) a better family.  Charlotte legally changed her name by Royal Licence on 6 October of the same year to Charlotte FitzGerald-de Ros. Members of the de Ros family lived in Thames Ditton for a long while. They had links with the brightest of society, from the Duke of Wellington downwards. Henry's younger brother was the notorious Lord Edward FitzGerald. Charlotte died on 9 January 1831.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baron de Ros", "response": ["*Charlotte FitzGerald-de Ros, 20th Baroness de Ros (1769\u20131831) (abeyance terminated 1806), first to be styled \"de Ros\""]}, {"page": "Henry FitzGerald-de Ros, 21st Baron de Ros", "response": ["Henry William FitzGerald-de Ros, 21st Baron de Ros (12 June 1793 \u2013 28/29 March 1839) was a British nobleman, the son of Lord Henry FitzGerald and his wife Charlotte FitzGerald-de Ros, 20th Baroness de Ros."]}, {"page": "William FitzGerald-de Ros, 22nd Baron de Ros", "response": ["Fitzgerald-de Ros was born into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family at Thames Ditton, Surrey, the third son of Lord Henry FitzGerald, fourth son of The 1st Duke of Leinster and Lady Emily Lennox.
