Wicks was best known as the lead singer-songwriter for the UK rock and power pop band The Records, who formed in London from the ashes of The Kursaal Flyers, during the 1977 punk rock movement. After The Records went their separate ways in 1982, Wicks remained musically active, writing, recording and performing new material, including with several musicians such as Debbi Peterson.\nThe songs of Wicks and his lyricist partner, Will Birch, have been recorded by The Searchers, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Too Much Joy, Michael Monroe, and numerous other artists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Records", "response": ["The Records formed out of the ashes of the Kursaal Flyers, a pub rock group featuring drummer Will Birch. In 1977, John Wicks joined the band as a rhythm guitarist, and he and Birch quickly started writing songs together, Wicks as composer, Birch as lyricist. The Kursaal Flyers dissolved three months after Wicks joined, but he and Birch continued to write songs together with the hopes of starting a new four-piece group with Birch on drums and Wicks on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Birch soon came up with a name for the formative band: The Records. The group's line-up initially included bassist Phil Brown and lead guitarist Brian Alterman, whose guitar riffs have been compared to that of the Byrds. Alterman played on two early demos that were later included on the album Paying for the Summer of Love, before joining another band. Alterman was replaced by Huw Gower in 1978. Like Birch and Wicks, Gower and Brown were music veterans: Gower had played with a band called the Ratbites from Hell, and Brown had been the bass player for the Janets.", "* John Wicks and the Records official site"]}, {"page": "Fool Around", "response": ["# \"Pin a Medal on Mary\" (Will Birch, John Wicks) \u2013 3:08"]}, {"page": "John Wicks And The Records", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Wicks (singer)"]}, {"page": "Of Hands and Hearts", "response": ["#\"Rising Stars\"* \u2013 4:29 (John Wicks)"]}, {"page": "International Pop Overthrow", "response": ["Artists who have played the International Pop Overthrow Festival include Walter Egan, Harmony Grass, Shoes, Off Broadway, John Wicks & The Records, The Rubinoos, The Cowsills, and Enuff Z'Nuff, as well as recent and current stars, such as Kara's Flowers (now known as Maroon 5), Phantom Planet, The Click Five, Jason Falkner, Seth Swirsky and The 88."]}, {"page": "John Wicks", "response": ["John Wicks or John Wick may refer to:", "* John Wicks (singer), singer and songwriter with the UK mod powerpop band The Records", "* John Wicks (drummer), American studio session drummer "]}, {"page": "Dave Nachmanoff", "response": ["Nachmanoff is originally from a Jewish family from Northern Virginia and currently makes his home in Davis, California.
