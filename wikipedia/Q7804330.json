It was also nominated as an audio book of the year for the British Book Awards. In the book, Murray points to what he sees as a cultural shift, away from established modes of religion and political ideology, in which various forms of victimhood can provide markers of social status. He divides his book into sections dealing with different forms of victimhood, including types of LGBT identity, feminism and racial politics. Murray criticises the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault for what he sees as a reduction of society to a system of power relations. Murray's book drew polarized responses from critics. Tim Stanley in The Daily Telegraph praised the book, calling Murray \"a superbly perceptive guide through the age of the social justice warrior\". Katie Law in the Evening Standard said that Murray \"tackled another necessary and provocative subject with wit and bravery\".

Others, including Boris Johnson, Julie Bindel Op-Ed. and Tim Stanley, made arguments against this criticism.

Taylor later made a public apology, saying: \"The shirt I wore this week \u2013 I made a big mistake, and I offended many people. And I'm very sorry about this\". Some writers expressed appreciation for Taylor's apology. A campaign was set up on the crowdfund website Indiegogo, with the objective of raising $3,000 to buy Taylor a gift, as a token of the public's appreciation for the work that he and the team had done.
