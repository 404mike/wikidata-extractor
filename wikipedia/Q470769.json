Originally a right-back, he converted to centre-back in 2016 in order to extend his playing career.He made 127 Premier League appearances for Bolton Wanderers and more than 250 in the Football League for a variety of clubs, and represented England at under-21 level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 3", "response": ["*  1983   \u2013 Nicky Hunt, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Tony Warner", "response": ["Upon his return to Fulham he played against Leicester City in the FA Cup, but then signed on loan for Norwich City until the end of the 2006\u201307 season as a replacement for the previous loan goalkeeper; Celtic's David Marshall. On 12 August 2007, after an injury to first choice Fulham goalkeeper Antti Niemi in the warm-up before The Cottagers game at The Emirates against Arsenal, Warner was forced to be a last minute replacement for Niemi, but despite the circumstances Warner impressed and kept countless shots at bay, but two late goals denied Warner a clean sheet and Fulham lost the game 2\u20131. In the following game against Bolton Wanderers on 15 August 2007, Warner dropped the ball after collecting it from a Nicky Hunt throw-in and gave former teammate Hei\u00f0ar Helguson a goal for Bolton, but somewhat redeemed himself after pulling off a full-stretch save from Nicolas Anelka and Fulham won 2\u20131. On 18 August against Middlesbrough, Warner gifted debutant Mido a goal, after Warner mistimed a shot from the Egyptian and the ball bounced off his chest and rolled into the back of the net, as in the Bolton game, he somewhat redeemed himself after pulling off a full-stretch save from central defender David Wheater. Warner's mistake this time affected the score, with Middlesbrough winning 2\u20131. With Niemi still injured and Warner regularly making mistakes, Fulham manager Lawrie Sanchez, brought in Kasey Keller on 23 August 2007, to provide cover and competition for Warner and Niemi. On 25 August 2007 Warner sat on the bench for the game at Aston Villa. On 28 August 2007, Warner played and kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over Shrewsbury Town at the New Meadow.
