Forty-eight new troopers were signed up mostly from the northern inland rivers of NSW. Lieutenant John Murray was appointed to the 4th Division, Lieut. Blandford to the 3rd Division and Sergeants Skelton, Pincolt and Richard A. Dempster were also appointed as officers in charge of other divisions. The Traylan barracks on the Burnett River near the now-abandoned site of Ceratodus, north of present-day Eidsvold, was established while the other major barracks, besides Callandoon, was at Wondai Gumbal near Yuleba. Sgt. Dempster was responsible for several large scale dispersals in 1852. The first was at Wallumbilla where an ex-trooper named Priam and a number of others were shot dead. Dempster then traveled to Ogilvie's Wachoo station near St. George and shot a large number of Aboriginal people with the aid of a man named Johnson who was the superintendent of the property. Johnson also shot dead a white storeperson in a \"friendly fire\" incident during this dispersal. Dempster, having fallen sick, then allowed Johnson to take charge of his division and lead it to Yamboukal (modern-day Surat) where a lot of Mandandanji working peacefully on this pastoral station were subsequently killed. As a result of this, Dempster was suspended for 3 months. It appears that neither Johnson nor Dempster faced any legal repercussions. Sgt. Skelton also led a number of dispersals across the Dawson River area and down to Ukabulla (also near Surat) where Mandandanji leader Bussamarai was killed. Collisions also occurred between John Murray's troopers and Kabi Kabi at Widgee and with Walker's forces and the Bigambul south of Callandoon. Native Police were also employed tracking down Chinese coolie labourers who had run away from the stations of powerful squatter capitalists such as Gordon Sandeman."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Moreton, Wide Bay, Burnett and Maranoa", "response": ["| Gordon Sandeman"]}, {"page": "Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, 1856\u20131858", "response": ["| Sandeman, GordonGordon Sandeman"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Leichhardt (Queensland)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Gordon Sandeman"]}, {"page": "Members of the Queensland Legislative Council, 1870\u20131879", "response": ["|| Gordon Sandeman ||  ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Members of the Queensland Legislative Council, 1880\u20131889", "response": ["|| Gordon Sandeman ||  ||  || Seat vacated"]}, {"page": "Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1868\u20131870", "response": ["|| Gordon Sandeman || Leichhardt || 1863\u20131870"]}, {"page": "Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1867\u20131868", "response": ["|| Gordon Sandeman || Leichhardt || 1863\u20131870"]}, {"page": "Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1863\u20131867", "response": ["|| Gordon Sandeman || Leichhardt || 1863\u20131870"]}, {"page": "List of New South Wales state by-elections", "response": ["||Moreton, Wide Bay, Burnett and Maranoa ||Gordon Sandeman|| Resigned || (19 November 1857) ||Patrick Leslie"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1856 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Moreton, Wide Bay, Burnett and Maranoa || |Gordon Sandeman || "]}, {"page": "Slavery in Australia", "response": ["Government enquiries delayed further coolie importation, but in 1842 a number of colonists, including William Wentworth and Gordon Sandeman, formed an Association to Import Coolies to pressure the colonial government into allowing further intakes. The following year, Major G.F. Davidson imported 30 Indian coolies into Melbourne, and in 1844 Sandeman and Phillip Freil organised a shipment of 30 Indian coolies, most of whom were sent to work on their properties in the Lockyer Valley. Wentworth and Robert Towns arranged a shipment of 56 Indian coolies who arrived in a state of starvation in 1846.", "Indian coolie transportation was largely discontinued after this but the first shipment of 150 Chinese coolies arrived in Melbourne in 1847 aboard the brig Adelaide and another 31 arrived in Perth a year later. Toward the end of 1848, Nimrod and Phillip Laing brought a further 420 mostly Chinese coolies into the Port Phillip District. Many of these coolies were abandoned, perished in the bush, were jailed, or were found wandering the streets of Melbourne with no food or shelter. Around another 1500 Chinese coolies were shipped into Australia up to the year 1854 with Robert Towns and Gordon Sandeman again being the principal organisers of the trade. A number of scandals occurred that caused a government select committee to be formed to investigate the importation of Asiatic labour. The inquiry found that 70 coolies had died aboard General Palmer during the voyage from Amoy to Sydney and that others had died from sickness once in Australia. There were no berths, bedding, medical, or toilet facilities available on the vessel and a great deal of kidnapping was involved in the recruitment process. The poor conditions on board the vessel Spartan, chartered by Robert Towns, sparked a rebellion of coolies against the crew of the ship. The second-mate and ten of the Chinese were killed before the captain was able to regain control. Out of nearly 250 coolies who had embarked on Spartan, only 180 arrived in Australia. These events together with concurrent disasters in the Chinese coolie trade to Cuba and Peru, ended Asian coolie transportation to Australia by 1855. From 1858, Chinese migration to Australia again spiked due to the gold rushes, but this was mostly voluntary travel."]}, {"page": "Woody Island Lighthouses", "response": ["In the two years following the establishment of the Marine Board Act 1862, due to a lack of funds to spend on marine safety, activity concentrated on dealing with pilots and harbour lights, The issue of coastal lights was not taken up until 25 May 1864, when Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly moved that a Select Committee be appointed to inquiry into and report upon the state of the harbours and rivers in the colony. The Committee consisted of Messrs Arthur Macalister, John Douglas, Gordon Sandeman, Robert Cribb, Henry Challinor and Joshua Peter Bell and convened for the first time on 27 May 1864.

In 1870 it was sold to Robert Towns and Alexander Stuart trading as Towns and Co., Towns holding a number of other properties at the time. In 1872 the run was acquired by Alexander Campbell and John Hay and in the late 1870s was restocked with cattle. In 1885, it passed to the Mercantile Bank of Sydney, which consolidated the run.
