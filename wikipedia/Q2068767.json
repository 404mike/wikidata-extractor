Time-slip was a popular theme in paranormal discussion, such as the Moberly\u2013Jourdain incident, also known as the Ghosts of Petit Trianon or Versailles. This was an event that occurred on 10 August 1901 in the gardens of the Petit Trianon, involving two female academics, Charlotte Anne Moberly (1846\u20131937) and Eleanor Jourdain (1863\u20131924). Moberly and Jourdain claimed to have slipped back to the last days of pre-Revolutionary France, reported in their later book An Adventure (1911).Other successful examples of time-slip in children's books include Alison Uttley's A Traveller in Time (1939, slipping back to the period of Mary, Queen of Scots), Ronald Welch's The Gauntlet  (1951, slipping back to the Welsh Marches in the fourteenth century), Clive King's Stig of the Dump (1963, with a final chapter slipping back to the making of Stone Henge), Barbara Sleigh's Jessamy (1967, back to the First World War), and Charlotte Sometimes by Penelope Farmer (1969, back to 1918)."]}, {"page": "Eleanor Cameron", "response": ["* \"Afterward\".

Charlotte begins to wonder, with increasing dismay, if she really is Charlotte: perhaps she has turned into Clare, rather than just substituted for her.
