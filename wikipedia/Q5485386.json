Maley managed to find him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, who was able to win the ball and bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders."]}, {"page": "Glossop North End A.F.C.", "response": ["* Frank Booth"]}, {"page": "Tabby (disambiguation)", "response": ["* nickname of Frank Booth (English footballer) (1882\u20131919)"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Frank Booth ||  || Winger || 1902\u20131912 || 107 || 19 || ||"]}, {"page": "Horace Barnes", "response": ["In 1914 Manchester City purchased Barnes for \u00a32,500.00.

Barnes' first goal for City came in a 4\u20131 victory against Bradford City on the opening day of the season. Barnes' career was interrupted by the first world war which he spent working in a munition factory.

At the end of the season the Football Association conducted an investigation into the financial activities of Manchester City and discovered that the team had been paying their players extra. The Football Association ruled that manager Tom Maley should be suspended from football for life while seventeen players were fined and suspended until January 1907.
