On 25 August, he scored in a 3\u20131 win over Morecambe at the Globe Arena, earning himself a place on the League Two team of the week. On 27 October, he was sent off for the second time in his career, again against Northampton at Sixfields, as he put in a late challenge on midfielder Alex Nicholls, who managed to score the opening goal of the match just before McCombe made his challenge; it was later confirmed that the tackle had broken Nicholls's leg. Opposition manager Aidy Boothroyd accepted McCombe's apology, and Northampton player Akinfenwa also stated that McCombe was \"not a malicious character\". McCombe himself picked up an injury on 1 January 2013, damaging knee ligaments in a defeat to Fleetwood Town, and was ruled out of action for several weeks. Vale secured promotion with a third-place finish at the end of the season, with McCombe playing 37 matches in a regularly changing four back. Despite still being under contract, he chose to leave the club in the summer."]}, {"page": "Alex Nicholls", "response": ["Alex Nicholls may refer to:", "* Alex Nicholls (footballer) (born 1987), English footballer", "* Alex Nicholls (academic) (born 1964), lecturer in social entrepreneurship at the University of Oxford", "* Alex Nicholls (rugby union) (born 1961), Zimbabwean rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["After struggling through October, Oldham started November at home against Yeovil Town who was coming off consecutive scoreless draws. It appeared it could have been three consecutive scoreless matches for Yeovil when the two teams were left without goals at halftime. Aaron Brown capitalised from a deep free kick, ending his side's goal drought to give the visitors a 1\u20130 lead. Ex-Oldham player Paul Warne grabbed another goal for the Glovers three minutes later from hesitant play by Neal Eardley. Oldham was unable to get a ball past goalkeeper Asmir Begovi\u0107, who secured a 2\u20130 victory for Yeovil and gave the Latics their first home loss since March 2008. After a 2\u20132 draw in the FA Cup, the Latics faced Northampton Town on 15 November. Oldham had several chances in the first half including a shot by Lee Hughes which was an apparent early goal, though he was flagged by the official for offsides. With a quarter of an hour left in the match, Hughes was cut down in the box to give Andy Liddell a chance to give the Latics a lead. Liddell easily converted on the spot-kick, sending Frank Fielding the wrong way. Despite the 1\u20130 victory, the game ended on a bad note as Hughes was sent off with his second yellow card. At Roots Hall, Southend United was just once beaten in their previous thirteen home games. James Walker tried to help him side continue the streak as he smashed the ball past Mark Crossley from point-blank range for a 1\u20130 Southend advantage. Chris Taylor pulled Oldham back on level terms with a 67th-minute header, before Hughes scored his seventh of the season to give Oldham a 2\u20131 victory. Three days later, Oldham faced off against Walsall at home. Mark Allott started the scoring early, grabbing an early 1\u20130 lead for Oldham from a deflected shot. Michael Ricketts, a former Oldham striker, struck back in 23rd minute with a goal before Alex Nicholls gave the visitors a 2\u20131 advantage. Shortly before the halftime whistle, Hughes scored his 8th goal of the season which put the two sides on level terms at the break. With the game looking like a sure draw, Hughes grabbed another goal in the 89th minute as Oldham moved up to 4th place to end November."]}, {"page": "List of Walsall F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Alex Nicholls"]}, {"page": "2006 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["In the area quarter-final, Swansea were drawn at home against Peterborough United. The two sides played out a goalless draw over 90 minutes, necessitating extra-time. Peterborough took a quick lead through Danny Crow but Swansea equalised one minute later via Akinfenwa. Robinson gave Swansea the lead in the 99th minute before Akinfenwa added his second goal ten minutes later to secure a 3\u20131 victory. Swansea met Walsall in the semi-final, taking an early lead through Leon Knight. He had a second goal disallowed before Walsall eventually equalised through an Alex Nicholls goal in the second half. Robinson gave Swansea the lead in the 83rd minute but his goal was quickly cancelled out by an equaliser from James Constable which sent the match to extra-time. The match eventually required a penalty shoot-out. The opening eight penalties were all successfully converted before the following four were all missed. The shootout ended when Walsall's Graham Deakin missed his side's eighth penalty, allowing Alan Tate to convert the winning penalty for Swansea."]}, {"page": "Alex Cisak", "response": ["On 6 July 2011, Cisak signed a two-year contract at Oldham Athletic. Oldham agreed a compensation package with Accrington because, though Cisak was out of contract, they were entitled to some recompense as he was under the age of 24. He made his club debut on the first day of the 2011\u201312 season, starting the Football League match against Sheffield United. Since then, Cisak established himself in the first team and made 43 appearance in the first team. On 5 November 2011, Cisak received his first straight red card of his career in a 2\u20130 loss against Bury after he brought down Andy Bishop in early minutes. After the match, manager Paul Dickov felt his position has got to be better. Despite his sending off, he played in the next match against Rochdale. In the third of the FA Cup, he played against Liverpool in a 5\u20131 loss. In a 2\u20131 win over Walsall on 14 February 2012, Cisak was the hero when he saved a penalty in injury time from Alex Nicholls. In late March, Cisak suffered a shoulder injury in a match against Leyton Orient after he collided with the post and was out for a month. Even though injured, Dickov refused to call up Cisak and James Wesolowski before the end of the season because he risked another injury. After playing five matches in the early of the season, Cisak was replaced by Dean Bouzanis due to a breakdown in his contract. Cisak spoke of his disappointment in Oldham's handling of the saga shortly after having been recalled from his loan at Portsmouth."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["October opened with a dismal home draw with Dagenham & Redbridge, with goalkeeper Chris Neal making an uncharacteristic error to allow a blunted \"Daggers\" attack to claim an unlikely goal. The team then rallied to produce a convincing 2\u20130 win away at fourth-placed Exeter City, Pope's two goals taking him into double figures with 35 league games yet to play. However injuries took hold of the small squad, with captain Loft sidelined with a calf injury, and winger Lewis Haldane forced to announce his retirement after failing to recover from a broken leg he sustained in August 2011. They played Oxford United on a Monday night in front of the Sky Sports cameras, and did themselves justice with a convincing 3\u20130 win, with both Ashley Vincent and Sam Morsy scoring impressive goals. An injury/suspension crisis in midfield then did little to prevent a patched up Vale side to come from behind to beat Gareth Ainsworth's Wycombe Wanderers 4\u20131. They then travelled to Staffordshire rivals Burton Albion, and battled to a 1\u20131 draw after falling behind to a fluke goal. The month ended on a sour note at Sixfields, as John McCombe was sent off after breaking the leg of Northampton Town goalscorer Alex Nicholls; injuries and suspensions left teenagers Joe Davis and Kingsley James to form a makeshift centre-back partnership, though the score was kept to a respectable 2\u20130. For a second successive time, a Vale player was named the division's Player of the Month; Ashley Vincent took the award, but credited his teammates, saying \"this award is as much for them as it is for me\"."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 14 || ST || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Alex Nicholls", "| 1 July 2012 || CF ||  || Alex Nicholls || Walsall || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 14 || ST || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Alex Nicholls"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 14 || ST || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Alex Nicholls", "|FW|| Alex Nicholls|| Exeter City||1 September 2014||4 October 2014||", "|FW|| Alex Nicholls|| Exeter City||27 November 2014||7 January 2015||"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["|1 September 2014||FW|| Alex Nicholls|| Northampton Town||4 October 2014||", "|27 November 2014||FW|| Alex Nicholls|| Northampton Town||7 January 2015||"]}]}}
