The women's team, now controlled by the Charlton Community Trust, the organisation which operates Charlton's community programmes, appointed former Charlton player Paul Mortimer as the women's team's new coach. However, due to the exodus of players after the original closure announcement, only two players from the previous squad remained by the time the club's rescue was in place although a few more returned as the season progressed. The reconstituted team finished bottom of the National Division of the FA Women's Premier League at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, thereby relegating them to the League's Southern Division. The team stabilised at this level and a reserve team was successfully re-established, twice winning the Kent Women's Cup in 2008\u201309 and 2010\u201311. The first team were promoted back to the National Division at the end of the 2010\u201311 season as Southern Division champions."]}, {"page": "Show Racism the Red Card", "response": ["SRTRC delivers programmes of community education in North East England, South and South East England, Scotland and Wales.
