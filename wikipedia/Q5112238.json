At the time, life for pupils at Winchester was arduous and austere; discipline was harsh. Sport and exercise were vital parts of the school day. In Jardine's time, preparing the pupils for war was also important.Douglas, pp. 6\u20139. According to Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, the pupils were \"taught to be honest, practical, impervious to physical pain, uncomplaining and civilised.\"Douglas, p. 9. All pupils were required to be academically competent and as such Jardine was able to get along satisfactorily without exhibiting academic brilliance; successful sportsmen, on the other hand, were revered.Douglas, p. 13. Jardine enjoyed a slightly better position than some pupils, already possessing a reputation as a very fine cricketer and excelling at other sports; he represented the school at football as a goalkeeper and rackets, and played Winchester College football.Douglas, pp. 6, 13\u201314. But it was at cricket that he particularly excelled. He was in the first eleven for three years from 1917 and received coaching from Harry Altham, Rockley Wilson and Schofield Haigh, the latter two of whom were distinguished cricketers.Douglas, pp. 11\u201312. In 1919, his final year, Jardine came top of the school batting averages with 997 runs at an average of 66.46. He also became captain despite some doubts within the school about his ability to unify the team.Douglas, p. 15. Under Jardine, Winchester won their annual match against Eton College in 1919, a fixture in which Eton had usually held the upper hand.Douglas, p. 11. Jardine's batting (35 and 89 in the match) and captaincy were key factors in his side's first victory over Eton for 12 years. Years later, after his retirement from cricket, he named his 89 in that match as his personal favourite innings. Jardine went on to score 135 not out against Harrow School.Douglas, pp. 17\u201318.Frith, p. 70.", "Playing more confidently and fluently in 1921, Jardine began the season well, scoring three fifties in his first three first-class matches. Oxford then played against the Australian touring side which dominated the season. In the second innings, Jardine scored 96 not out to save the game but was unable to complete his century before the game ended. The innings was praised by those who saw it and the Australians were criticised in the press for not allowing Jardine to reach his hundred, particularly as the match had been reduced from three days to two at their request.Fingleton, pp. 81\u201382. They had tried to help him with some easy bowling but the situation was confusing as batsmen's scores were not displayed on the ground's scoreboard. Some critics have speculated that this incident led to Jardine's later hatred of Australians, although Christopher Douglas does not believe this.Douglas, pp. 30\u201331. Cricket historian David Frith believes that Australian captain Warwick Armstrong may have addressed sarcastic comments to Jardine but Wisden blamed Jardine himself for batting too slowly to score a century. The Australian manager expressed regret that he missed out. This innings was the highest that had been played to that point in the season against the Australians, and only one higher score was made before the first Test. Consequently, Plum Warner, an influential figure who had recently captained Middlesex, suggested in The Cricketer magazine that Jardine should play for England in the first Test, which followed the Oxford match. Warner had been previously impressed by Jardine. The latter remained in Test contention for a short time, but was not selected.Douglas, pp. 23, 31\u201332. In the meantime, he scored his maiden first-class hundred against The Army and another followed against Sussex. Both innings were cautious, with defence his main priority for much of the innings, but he failed in the match against Cambridge.Douglas, pp. 32\u201333. ", "Jardine missed most of the 1922 season owing to a serious knee injury; he played only four matches at a time when he was expected to make a big impression. He missed Oxford's match against Cambridge and was unable to play for Surrey at all that season.Douglas, pp. 40\u201342. Even so, in 1922 he was selected by The Isis as one of its men of the year.Douglas, p. 42. After some problems with his troublesome knee, Jardine returned to cricket by May of the 1923 season. He was not given the Oxford captaincy in his final year, which has led to later speculation that his manner and unfriendliness was held against him. However, his persistent injury and the availability of other deserving candidates may have provided some of the explanation.Le Piesse, p. 119.Douglas, p. 43. Jardine gradually found his batting form, and contributed to Oxford's only win over Cambridge in the decade.Douglas, p. 44. During one innings of another match, he received criticism for using his pads to stop the ball from hitting the wickets: this was fully within the laws of the game but was considered controversial, being seen by critics to be against the spirit of the game. Christopher Douglas traces Jardine's hostility towards the press and critics to this incident.Douglas, pp. 44\u201346. He also received criticism for his slow batting for Oxford, again being singled out due to his known ability to play attacking shots. Partly this was because Jardine held a responsible position, with the team often reliant on his personal success. The complaints against him were a manifestation of wider criticism of young amateur batting at the time for its supposed lack of verve and enterprise, as older commentators began to hark back to the \"golden age\" before the war.Douglas, pp. 39\u201340, 47\u201348. Jardine left Oxford in 1923 having scored a total of 1,381 runs and was awarded a fourth class degree in modern history.", "At the beginning of the 1930 season, Jardine was offered the vice-captaincy of Surrey. He was unable to accept owing to business commitments and played just nine matches for the season, scoring 402 runs at an average of 36.54 and managing one century and one fifty. He was never in the running for Test selection that season, although his presence may have been missed as the English batting was unreliable in the Tests. Christopher Douglas argues that had Jardine been playing regularly, he would have been made captain for the final Test, when Chapman was dropped in favour of the sounder batsman Bob Wyatt.Douglas, p. 87. The sensation of the Test series was Donald Bradman, who dominated the English bowling to score 974 runs with unprecedented speed and certainty, making the English selectors realise that something must be done to address his skill.Gibson, pp. 97\u201398. With Bradman at the fore, Australia regained the Ashes 2\u20131.", "Jardine played a full season of cricket in 1931. In June, he was appointed as captain for the Test against New Zealand (two more Tests were later added). The English selectors were searching for possible captains for the 1932\u201333 tour of Australia, with Bradman and Australia's strong batting line up foremost in their minds. Christopher Douglas believes that, as Jardine was not a regular county captain, the selectors wanted to assess his leadership ability but had probably not settled on him as a final choice. He was also chosen as a dependable, proven batsman.Douglas, pp. 93\u201395. While Percy Fender approved of his appointment, The Times' correspondent believed that he was unproven and others were more deserving of the leadership.Douglas, pp. 94\u201395. Ian Peebles, writing 40 years later, claimed that Jardine's appointment was popular but cricket administrators had misgivings.Peebles, p. 83. Alan Gibson believed that Jardine was chosen because the other candidates were either not worth their place in the side, too old or had controversy attached to them.Gibson, pp. 148\u201356. Furthermore, Jardine impressed the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, who stated that he was very effective in selection meetings through his knowledge of cricket history and went into great detail to choose the correct players;Warner, p. 136. it seems that Warner was the driving force behind Jardine's appointment.Le Quesne, p. 122.", "Jardine was seen as having a classical technique. While batting, he stood very straight and side on to the bowler. His off-driving was powerful, his defence was excellent, and he was superb at judging the line of the ball and letting it pass by if it was going to miss his wickets. His on-side play was also excellent, being able to place the ball between fielders for easy runs.Douglas, pp. 55\u201356. Christopher Douglas described Jardine as \"the epitome of the old-fashioned amateur\". However, he also comments that his approach to batting was like that of a professional and that his back-foot batting was of a quality that few amateurs could manage. In 1928, Wisden's correspondent described Jardine as the most secure amateur batsman of the time, and identified his greatest strength as his defence and his \"mental gifts.\" He played very straight and hit the ball hard in defence, but could not play all the strokes, particularly on the off side. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed that Jardine had modelled himself on C. B. Fry. He also noted that Jardine displayed good concentration, a strong desire to improve his batting and a fighting spirit that brought out his best in a crisis.Robertson-Glasgow, p. 21. He also said that Jardine could play every recognised cricket shot, but would not do so in a match and Robertson-Glasgow believed it was Jardine's one weakness as a batsman. The more important the occasion, the more defensive and restricted Jardine's batting became: \"In general, as the task grew greater, the strokes grew fewer.\"", "Christopher Douglas argues that Jardine liked to make his runs when his side was in difficulty and enjoyed being tested; his approach would often lead his team to recovery from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held his place in the England side despite strong competition from other batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat).Douglas, p. 197. He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's, making a good score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.", "As a captain, Jardine inspired great loyalty in his players, even if they did not approve of his tactics.Gibson, p. 160. Christopher Douglas judges that Jardine did very well to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour. He points out that team spirit was always excellent and the players showed great determination and resolve.Douglas, p. 161. Jardine particularly impressed Yorkshiremen who played under him, as they believed he thought about cricket in a similar way to their county colleagues. He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928\u201329. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine's tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain.Hill, pp. 75, 79\u201380. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings,Bowes, pp. 100\u201301. and went on to call him England's greatest captain. Nevertheless, some players such as Arthur Mitchell who played under Jardine believed he was intolerant and unsupportive of players of lesser talent, expecting everyone to perform at world-class standards.Hill, pp. 78\u201379.", "Shortly before the tour of India in 1933\u201334, Jardine became engaged and on  1934, married Irene \"Isla\" Margaret Peat in London. She had met Jardine at shooting parties at her father's Norfolk home. According to Gerald Howat, Jardine's marriage was the probable reason for his giving up playing first-class cricket.Douglas, p. 192. Jardine's father-in-law was keen for him to pursue his law career but he instead continued as a bank clerk and began to work as a journalist. He reported on the 1934 Ashes for the Evening Standard.Douglas, p. 188. His writing for the press, and in a follow-up book on the series, was critical of selectors but less so of the players.Douglas, pp. 189\u201391. In 1936, he penned Cricket: how to succeed, which was written as an instruction book for the National Union of Teachers. There was a possibility of his going to Australia as a journalist to cover the M.C.C. tour of 1936\u201337, to the dismay of Hore-Ruthven, but nothing came of this. With alterations to the law in 1935, changing the lbw law and preventing Bodyline bowling, Jardine became increasingly disillusioned with top-level cricket. He had grown uncomfortable with the nationalism stirred up by Tests, the greed of clubs and the large public following of individual players, particularly Bradman.Douglas, pp. 194\u201395. At the same time, Jardine seemed to be ostracised by cricket writers and commentators, who simply ignored him. For example, Wisden made no mention of his retirement. Christopher Douglas believes that Jardine was used as a scapegoat for Bodyline once the M.C.C. stopped supporting the tactic and that a stigma was attached to him for the rest of his life and beyond.Douglas, pp. 195\u201396.", "Although Jardine had retired from regular first-class competition, he continued to play club cricket.Douglas, p. 198. Jardine and his wife initially lived in Kensington but moved to Reading after the birth of their first child, daughter Fianach. A second daughter, Marion, followed but the family suffered from financial worries. Jardine, as well as working in journalism, earned money from playing bridge. The family also tried unsuccessfully to engage in market gardening. To make more money, Jardine became a salesman with Cable & Wireless before working for a coal mining company in the late 1930s. In 1939, he returned to cricket journalism and according to Christopher Douglas, achieved his highest standard as a writer.Douglas, pp. 200\u201301.", "Jardine is inextricably associated with Bodyline. John Arlott wrote in 1989 that \"It is no exaggeration to say that, among Australians, Douglas Jardine is probably the most disliked of cricketers.\" In the view of Christopher Douglas, his name \"stands for the legendary British qualities of cool-headed determination, implacable resolve, patrician disdain for crowds and critics alike\u00a0\u2013 if you're English that is. To Australians the name is synonymous with the legendary British qualities of snobbishness, cynicism and downright Pommie arrogance.\" He also argues that Bodyline, which was legal at the time, was a necessary step to overcome the unfair advantage which batsmen of the time enjoyed."]}, {"page": "Basil D'Oliveira", "response": ["The D'Oliveira Affair had a massive impact in turning international opinion against the apartheid regime in South Africa.
