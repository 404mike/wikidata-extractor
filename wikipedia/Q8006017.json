McDougall, knowing Burt's interest in Galton's work, taught him the elements of psychometrics, thus helping Burt with his first steps in the development and structure of mental tests, an interest that would last the rest of his life. Burt was one of a group of students who worked with McDougall, which included William Brown, John Fl\u00fcgel, and May Smith, who all went on to have distinguished careers in psychology.Hearnshaw, (1979), p. 11. Burt graduated with second-class honours in Literae Humaniores (Classics) in 1906, taking a special paper in Psychology in his Final Examinations. He subsequently supplemented his BA with a teaching diploma."]}, {"page": "Spearman\u2013Brown prediction formula", "response": ["The name Spearman-Brown seems to imply a partnership, but the two authors were competitive. This formula originates from two papers published simultaneously by Brown (1910) and Spearman (1910) in the British Journal of Psychology. Charles Spearman had a hostile relationship with Karl Pearson who worked together in King's College London, and they exchanged papers that criticized and ridiculed each other.Cowles, M. (2005) Statistics in psychology: An historical perspective. New York: Psychology Press. William Brown received his Ph.D. under Pearson's guidance. An important part of Brown's doctoral dissertation Later published as a book Brown, W. (1911). The essentials of mental measurement. London: Cambridge University Press. was devoted to criticizing Spearman' work.Spearman, C. (1904). The proof and measurement of association between two things.
