Richardson was a left-handed batsman who bowled leg break. He was born at Kenilworth, Warwickshire.\nRichardson made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Scotland in 1963 at The Grange, Edinburgh. He played first-class cricket for Warwickshire for five seasons, making a total of forty appearances, the last of which came in the 1967 County Championship against Yorkshire at Acklam Park, Middlesbrough. In his forty matches, he scored a total of 1,323 runs at an average of 19.45, with a high score of 126. This score was one of two centuries he made and came against Cambridge University in 1967. This season was also his most success, with him making fifteen appearances, three times as many as he had in any other season. He scored 727 runs at an average of 30.29, recording both his first-class centuries, as well as three half centuries. He also made a single List A appearance for the county in the quarter-final of the 1964 Gillette Cup against Northamptonshire. In what was a Warwickshire victory, Richardson scored 17 runs before being dismissed by Brian Crump.His brothers, Peter and Dick, both played Test cricket for England.\nHe was chairman of Coventry City F.C. from 1993 until 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "C\u00e9dric Roussel", "response": ["Midway through January 2001, with Coventry struggling in the league, a number of bids were made for Roussel's services, including one from Wimbledon. After refusing to sign for Wimbledon, he criticized the Coventry board for trying to use him as a makeweight in a deal to bring John Hartson to the club. He was particularly critical of the club's chairman Bryan Richardson for forcing through the Wimbledon transfer, accusing him of not repaying the loyalty Roussel himself had shown in signing permanently for the club, despite interest from \"several classier clubs.\" Roussel would however later describe his time at Coventry as \"the best part of my career.\""]}, {"page": "Coventry Building Society Arena", "response": ["The decision to move Coventry City F.C. from Highfield Road to a new stadium \u2013 with a larger capacity and better road links and parking facilities \u2013 was made in 1997 by the club's then chairman Bryan Richardson.

McGinnity also has an MBE."]}, {"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["Bryan Richardson took over as chairman of the club in summer 1993 and the club made another strong start to 1993\u201394, opening with a Quinn hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win at Arsenal and being unbeaten after eight games. Trouble followed however, as a 5\u20131 defeat at Queen's Park Rangers was followed by Gould's resignation, the manager claiming that Richardson was forcing him into selling star striker Peter Ndlovu. Phil Neal took over and was initially allowed to strengthen the team rather than sell. The club played some positive football and possessed two top-class players in Ndlovu and Phil Babb, but remained unable to play consistently through a whole season and finished 11th. A strong end to the season meant that 1994\u201395 began with optimism, enhanced by Neal's purchase of Dion Dublin and American winger Cobi Jones. December injuries to Dublin and David Busst led to a poor run of results, culminating in FA Cup defeat to Norwich and supporters quickly turned against Phil Neal. Neal's reputation had also fallen with the release of \"The Impossible Job\", a documentary about former England manager Graham Taylor and Neal, his assistant, which portrayed the latter as a \"yes man\" with no independent opinions. He was sacked and replaced by Ron Atkinson, with Gordon Strachan named assistant manager.", "The 1997\u201398 season, Strachan's first full campaign in charge, was much more successful. A solid 11th-place finish in the league was accompanied by the club's best FA Cup run since 1987, ending only with a quarter-final replay defeat on penalties at Sheffield United. Notable wins during the season included a 3\u20132 win against champions Manchester United, featuring a Darren Huckerby goal that won goal of the month, an FA Cup win at Liverpool and the club's first ever win away to Aston Villa in the FA Cup fifth round. Dion Dublin's 18 league goals earned him a share of the Premier League Golden Boot for the season and he played for England during the season but failed to make the squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Off the pitch, Bryan Richardson revealed ambitious plans for the club's future including \"Arena 2000\", the initial proposals for the Ricoh Arena. The plans at that time envisaged a 40,000-seat stadium, to be opened in 2001, which was also designated as one of the host venues in the unsuccessful England 2006 FIFA World Cup bid. The next season proved a disappointment after the optimism of the previous campaign. City achieved an opening-day victory over a Chelsea team of international stars, but this was followed by four defeats in the next five games. A run of six games with only one defeat in the spring took the club clear of the relegation fight, but a poor run-in saw them finish in 15th. Another cup run seemed on the cards after a 7\u20130 win over Macclesfield and a 3\u20130 defeat at local rivals Leicester in the third and fourth rounds, but it was ended by a poor performance in a 2\u20131 fifth round defeat at Everton. Adding to supporters' frustration, several top players left during the season and the subsequent summer. This included Dublin, who was sold to Aston Villa for \u00a35.75 million in an acrimonious deal, as well as Huckerby and George Boateng."]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Bryan Richardson (1963\u20131967) : B.
