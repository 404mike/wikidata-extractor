At the end of 1848 she took in an abused woman, Marianne George, who had four children fathered by her own step father. Encouraged by the Rector Thomas Thellusson Carter, she offered to take in more 'helpless women'. By the following June she had two more and soon there was twelve. These women could be unruly so Mariquita took in various offers of help. However she could be a difficult person and none of her helpers stayed very long, although Charlotte Julia Weale stayed there for six months. Weale was a great help and in spare time she documented not only the lives of the women they took in but Tennant as well. She recorded the daily routine and correspondence with supporters like Gladstone. Tennant was not a fluent English speaker but she was ambitious. Tennant called Weale Sister Dorotea and she had plans to establish a religious order, but Tennant eccentric behaviour attracted no novices."]}, {"page": "Charlotte Weale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlotte Julia Weale"]}]}}
