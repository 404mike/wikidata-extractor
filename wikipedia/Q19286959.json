Its purpose is to study the history of prehistoric and historic settlement in southwestern Greece (modern Messenia). The focus of the expedition entails surveying the Bronze Age administrative center known as the Palace of Nestor. Its directors were Professors Jack L. Davis, John Bennet, Susan E.

Retrieved on September 2, 2008. \"The Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP) is a multi-disciplinary, diachronic archaeological expedition formally organized in 1990 to investigate the history of prehistoric and historic settlement and land use in western Messenia in Greece, in an area centered on the Bronze Age administrative center known as the Palace of Nestor. The project has employed the techniques of archaeological surface survey, along with natural environmental investigations (geological, geomorphological, geophysical, and paleobotanical). In the summers of 1991-95, approximately 40 square kilometers in western Messenia were examined intensively. These included areas to the north, east, south, and west of the modern town of Hora, and the entirety of the Englianos Ridge (Upper and Lower) - the location of the Palace of Nestor. Fieldwork doubled the number of sites previously known in the area intensively surveyed. In addition, nearly all previously known sites in an additional 30 square kilometers have been reinvestigated; the spatial extent and chronological components of these have been defined with greater precision. Members of PRAP are committed to making the results of the project quickly available to the general public and scholars through the Internet. The table of contents contains links to existing publications and reports, some of which are available on-line. In addition we are making available a complete site gazetteer, with descriptions of all sites investigated by PRAP and preliminary catalogues of artifacts found at them. We encourage use of this gazetteer for scholarly purposes. The complete pottery catalog, small finds database, and photography database are also searchable on-line."]}, {"page": "Marett Lecture", "response": ["| John Bennet"]}, {"page": "Archaeological Review from Cambridge", "response": ["|John Bennet", "A number of notable archaeologists have contributed to the journal since its founding, including: Graeme Barker, Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, Christopher Chippindale, Ian Hodder, Lynn Meskell, Colin Renfrew, Chris Scarre, Charles Thurstan Shaw, Laurajane Smith, Peter Stone, Christopher Tilley, and John Bennet, amongst others."]}, {"page": "John Bennet", "response": ["John Bennet may refer to:", "*John Bennet (composer) (c. 1575 \u2013 after 1614), English composer", "*John Bennet (judge) (1552/3\u20131627),  English judge and MP accused of corruption", "*John Bennet (preacher) (1714\u20131759), English Methodist preacher", "*John Bennet (MP) (1628\u20131663), English landowner and politician", "*John Bennet, 1st Baron Ossulston (1616\u20131695), English statesman", "*John Bennet (archaeologist) (born 1957), British archaeologist and Professor of Aegean Archaeology at Sheffield University", "*John Bennet, 5th Baronet of the Bennet baronets", "*John Bennet Lawes (1814\u20131900), English entrepreneur and agricultural scientist", "*John Bennett (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Bennet (surname)", "response": ["* John Bennet, a number of individuals with the name ", "** John Bennet of the Bennet baronets", "** John Bennet (composer) (c. 1575\u2013after 1614), English composer", "** John Bennet (judge) (1552/3\u20131627),  English judge and MP accused of corruption", "** John Bennet (preacher) (1714\u20131759), English Methodist preacher", "** John Bennet (MP) (1628\u20131663), English landowner and politician", "** John Bennet, 1st Baron Ossulston (1616\u20131695), English statesman", "** John Bennet (archaeologist) (born 1951), British archaeologist and Professor of Aegean Archaeology at Sheffield University"]}, {"page": "Donald John Logan Bennet", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Bennet (archaeologist)"]}, {"page": "Linda Hulin", "response": ["* BBC Radio 4, In Our Time The Bronze Age Collapse link, 2016.

Postgraduates at the department founded Assemblage, an online peer-reviewed journal for graduate students to share their work, in 1994 with the first issue published in 1996. Over time, the journal began to include articles from more established researchers and was one of the first online-only archaeology journals. The 1990s also saw the expansion of the department to include commercial archaeological projects through the establishment of ARCUS (Archaeological Research and Consultancy at the University of Sheffield). During this period, several research centres and groups were established that went on to grow into significant international institutions. In 1995, the Sheffield Centre for Aegean Archaeology (SCAA) was established by (now Professor) Keith Branigan which was further enhanced in 2004 by the appointment of John Bennet to Sheffield\u2019s first Chair in Aegean Archaeology. The Centre capitalised on the expanding material analysis and material culture studies research areas to develop petrographic analyses of Mediterranean ceramics, including the appointment of Peter Day to a lectureship in 1994. The Sheffield Centre for Archaeobotany and ancient Land-usE (SCALE) was also established during this period by researchers including Glynis Jones."]}]}}
