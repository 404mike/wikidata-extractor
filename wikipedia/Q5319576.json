He then left the younger children in the care of Fiona, and moved in with agoraphobic Sheila. Often known to make a fool out of himself and shirk all responsibility, Frank nonetheless shows signs of loving his children. He can offer good advice, for example saving Liam from being taken into care when a parent was needed. When he is rendered completely sober by a new drug, Frank appears reflective and even quite intelligent, wondering why Sheila would add to her problems by marrying a mess like him. We also understand his character a bit better when Frank's father pays a visit and treats his son in a condescending and abrasive manner. Frank's father shows extreme sympathy towards Sheila and even takes care of the twins. It is also stated that his father did not always treat Frank kindly when Frank was growing up.", "Monica Gallagher (born 24 April 1963) is Frank Gallagher's (David Threlfall) estranged wife, and the mother of Fiona (Anne-Marie Duff), Lip (Jody Latham), Ian (Gerard Kearns), Carl (Elliott Tittensor), Debbie (Rebecca Ryan), Liam (Johnny Bennett) and Stella (Nikita Brownlee). She is bisexual and left Frank for a lorry driver named Norma Starkey (Dystin Johnson). She came home at the end of series 1 but had left by the start of series 2, she then returned for good at the beginning of series 4 and resumed co-habiting with Frank. Although her intentions for this were unknown at first, a visit from her mother in series 5 explained her backstory and a possible reason of why she returned to be with her children. Monica announced at the beginning of series 5 that she was pregnant again, giving birth to Stella at the end of the series. She has two known grandchildren, an unnamed child from Fiona when she left in Series 2, and Lip's daughter, Katie Maguire. Monica appeared in 40 episodes overall.", "Jessie McQueen, better known as Jez was the landlady of The Jockey on the Chatsworth estate during the first four series. She was a lesbian constantly looking for love, which she tried to seek from Norma Starkey (Dystin Johnson) and Karen Jackson (Rebecca Atkinson), who told her she was a lesbian so that she could get a job at the pub. She later discovered the truth and the two women became good friends, running The Jockey together. In series 4, she employed murderer Jamie Maguire (Aaron McCusker) as barman out of fear of retribution if she didn't. She became a surrogate mother and left Carol Fisher (Marjorie Yates) to run The Jockey whilst she was on maternity leave. After giving birth, she didn't return to The Jockey or Chatsworth, last being mentioned when The Jockey punters wanted to send her get-well cards after she had the baby. She has not been heard or seen since going on maternity leave, and she completely lost control of the Jockey when the brewery appointed Karen as landlady.

It featured the biggest cast change in the show's nine-year run, with many characters from the first three series departing and many new characters introduced to replace them. Most notably, the series saw the introduction of the Maguire family as main characters rather than the antagonists that they were in the early series. From Series 4, the Maguires would gradually become the focus of the show during its final years. Alongside Tina Malone (Mimi), Sean Gilder (Paddy) and Samantha Siddall (Mandy), new members of the Maguire family were introduced. Firstly, Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths took on the role of the homosexual yet homophobic Micky Maguire. Aaron McCusker joined the cast as murderer Jamie Maguire, the oldest of the Maguire children who had been in prison for ten years, whilst Nicky Evans, who appeared in a guest role in Series 3, returned on a regular basis as Shane Maguire. All the Gallagher family returned, with Annabelle Apsion reprising her role again as absentee mother Monica, which ultimately led to the departure of Maggie O'Neill's character Sheila Jackson. Dystin Johnson as Monica's lesbian lover, Norma Starkey, also returned as a regular cast member. With the introduction of Aaron McCusker as her new love interest, Rebecca Atkinson, who had played Karen Jackson since the first series, became a more prominent character, having been a recurring character during the second and third series. The Karib family also expanded in Series 4, with the arrivals of Kash and Yvonne's children, Chesney, played by Qasim Akhtar, and Meena, portrayed by Sarah Byrne, occurring in this series. The Chatsworth police became a more prominent focus in the series, with Michael Legge and Amanda Ryan portraying young police officers Tom O'Leary and Carrie Rogers, alongside original cast member Warren Donnelly as Stan Waterman.", "The series begins with Debbie's 16th birthday. Ian recovers from amnesia after being struck by a car, and decides he wants more from life than Chatsworth has to offer. Monica is suffering from post-natal depression after the birth of her and Frank's ninth child, Stella. Mickey enrolls in college, and discovers a talent for writing erotica. Maxine Donnelly, played by Joanna Higson, a spirited young auxiliary nurse, befriends both Carl and Debbie, and moves in with the Gallaghers. A parents' meeting at Liam's primary school affirms that Frank's youngest son is a genius. A rift develops in Jamie and Karen's marriage. Ben Batt joined the cast as villainous Joe Pritchard, the captain of the local football team, who began a relationship with Mandy which ended in him becoming abusive. Additionally, he developed an obsession with Karen, leading to an affair, and when she falls pregnant in the last episode of the series, she does not know whether the father is Joe or Jamie. Maddison gets a boyfriend as Kash Karib for a single episode towards the end of the series, with his character being killed off in a fireworks explosion at the shop as his and Yvonne's lies became apparent to their children, Chesney and Meena. Paddy is held hostage by a mystery woman who gets him addicted to heroin, but things take a sinister turn when she gets Mandy involved, ultimately resulting in tragedy. Samantha Siddall left her role as Mandy Maguire in this series after being killed off in an explosion, coinciding with her father Paddy's heroin addiction storyline. Series 6 also saw the departures of Rebecca Ryan as Debbie Gallagher, Dystin Johnson as Norma Starkey and Sarah Byrne as Meena Karib, with Annabelle Apsion, also leaving her role as Monica Gallagher, however she would return for guest stints in future series. The tone of Series 6 was noticeably darker than previous series, something which continued into Series 7.", "| colspan=\"1\" style=\"background: #fdd;\" | Dystin Johnson || colspan=\"1\" style=\"background: #ececec;\" | || colspan=\"1\" style=\"background: #fdd;\" | Dystin Johnson || colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #dfd;\" | Dystin Johnson || colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ececec;\" |"]}, {"page": "List of dramatic television series with LGBT characters: 1960s\u20132000s", "response": ["| Norma Starkey|| Dystin Johnson || Norma is a lorry driver who is involved with Monica Gallagher."]}, {"page": "List of lesbian characters in television", "response": ["|Norma Starkey || Dystin Johnson || Shameless (U.K.) || A lorry driver who was previously Monica Gallagher's lover after her split from Frank Gallagher."]}]}}
