For O'Farrelly and indeed her closest friend Douglas Hyde, who also took an active interest, the Celtic Congress held much in common with the Gaelic League with which they had for so long been involved: its raison-d\u2019\u00eatre was to nurture and promote scholarship and culture (albeit 'Celtic' rather than Irish); the congress was in theory to be held annually (similar to the Oireachtas); and its leading members were now drawn from educationalist and linguistic circles rather than the more exclusive Dublin Castle circle with which it had been associated at the turn of the twentieth century. Mary Hayden, Osborn Bergin, Eoin Mac N\u00e9ill and Robin Flower were among those also involved in the Irish wing of the Celtic Congress. When E.T. John died in early 1931, O'Farrelly took on a heavier administrative role within the Celtic Congress, and in the Breton Francois Jaffrennou-Taldir's words, \"the Association was given a new life in 1935 [sic], thanks to Miss Agnes O'Farrelly\"."]}, {"page": "Dublin Women's Suffrage Association", "response": ["Prominent members of the association in the 20th century were Lady Margaret Dockrell, Bridget Dudley Edwards and Mary Hayden.\"Dr Robin Dudley Edwards dies in Dublin\", Irish Times, 6 June 1988 Prominent supporters included Charles Cameron, Sir Andrew Reed, Willie Redmond MP, and William Field MP.Irish Times, 5 September 1908. p 7"]}, {"page": "Irish Catholic Women's Suffrage Association", "response": ["The Irish Catholic Women's Suffrage Association (ICWSA) was an organisation for women's suffrage which was set up in Dublin in November 1915. The association was established rather late in the struggle for women's suffrage (the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society was formed in the UK in 1911), despite the fact that most of Ireland's population was Catholic. Many also considered it risky to start a suffrage association with the potential of war looming over Ireland. Its founder members included Mary Hayden, a professor of modern Irish history at the University of Dublin and the first female to serve in the senate of the National University of Ireland (1909-1924), and Mrs. Gwynn (wife of Stephen Gwynn) who was the Honorary Secretary of the association. The association was non-party, non-militant, and was established to \"organise Catholic women to fight for suffrage,\" educate public opinion, bring Catholic women to realise the need for the female vote, and do the \"common good in the name of Catholicism\".", "When the ICWSA was established, they operated from an office at 15 Ely Place in Dublin, Ireland. Their first meeting was on March 29, 1915 and all following meetings were held every two weeks. The ICWSA began with 60 members, all women, and their numbers steadily increased. In their first meeting, Mrs. Gleeson, an involved member, designed a badge for the group which featured a Celtic symbol in green, blue, and white. Members wore these badges at meetings and at public events. During their meetings, members supplied the afternoon tea which they drink while reading articles \"concerning women\u2019s interests\". During their meetings Hon. Secretary Mrs. Gwynn and Mrs. Mary Hayden gave speeches on what they had accomplished and what they planned to do in the future. The members of the ICWSA also paired up with other suffrage groups to protest or petition the government."]}, {"page": "List of Irish women writers", "response": ["*Mary Hayden (1862\u20131942), historian, Irish-language and women's rights activist"]}, {"page": "Isabella Mulvany", "response": ["She has been seen as a major influence on several of Ireland's leading feminists, revolutionaries and pioneers like Mary Hayden, Alice Oldham and Kathleen Lynn.
