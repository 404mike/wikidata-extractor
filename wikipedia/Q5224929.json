He joined Torquay on a free transfer in June 2005, playing in a side almost relegated for a second successive season.\nIn June 2006 he was given in 3-month contract extension, but in October 2006 was told by Torquay manager Ian Atkins that he would be released at the end of November.

Having been a mid-table team for a number of years, a brush with relegation came at the start of the nineties, and Stuart Morgan was introduced as manager in 1993.

During the campaign Beadle signed three veteran players: Dean Holdsworth (who would later replace him as manager), Darren Garner, and Nathan Blake. The 2007\u201308 season saw the last instalment of the FAW Premier Cup, and Beadle led his club to the final with shock wins over the two Welsh giants: Swansea City and Cardiff City. A 1\u20130 win over Llanelli in the final meant that Newport got to keep the trophy and the \u00a3100,000 prize money. However Newport finished ninth in the league in 2007\u201308, once again a final day defeat at Newport Stadium cost them a place in the play-offs. Had they beaten Fisher Athletic then they would have finished fifth, and would have guaranteed themselves a play-off spot.
