Thereafter, Samuel approached his friend, Richard Sharp (politician), a fellow Dissenter, fellow member of the Fishmongers' Company, and both mutual friends of Samuel Rogers, asking if he would join him in business, and eventually a West India company of Boddington, Sharp and Philips (Sir George Philips, 1st Baronet) was established at 17 Mark Lane.
