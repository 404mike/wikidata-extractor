In addition to her brief movie career, Cooper was also known for being the mistress of General Douglas MacArthur.Born in Manila, she was infamous for the first on-screen kiss in a Filipino movie, Ang Tatlong Hambog (1926). In 1930, she met US General Douglas MacArthur and became his mistress. He arranged for her to follow him to Washington, D.C.\nWhile serving as Army Chief of Staff in the 1930s, MacArthur filed a libel action against a journalist at The Washington Post, Drew Pearson. When Pearson added Cooper to his list of witnesses to be deposed, MacArthur dropped the suit. MacArthur subsequently paid Cooper $15,000 to leave Washington, the money allegedly delivered by his aide, Dwight Eisenhower. However, she did not return to the Philippines, and after a few failed attempts in Hollywood and a hair dressing shop in the Midwest, committed suicide in 1960.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isabel Cooper", "response": ["#redirect Elizabeth Cooper"]}, {"page": "List of Filipino actresses", "response": ["*Elizabeth Cooper (1914\u20131960)"]}, {"page": "Cooper (surname)", "response": ["*Elizabeth Cooper (died 1960), Filipino-American actress"]}, {"page": "Isabel Rosario Cooper", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Cooper"]}, {"page": "Dimple (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Elizabeth Cooper (1914\u20131960), Scottish-Filipina film actress, vaudeville dancer and singer, mistress of General Douglas McArthur, nicknamed \"Dimples\""]}, {"page": "Dimples Cooper", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Cooper"]}, {"page": "Miracle of Love (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Miracles of Love, a 1925 Philippine film starring Elizabeth Cooper"]}, {"page": "Patrick Dupond", "response": ["Choreographers such as John Neumeier, Roland Petit, Yury Grigorovich, Alwin Nikolais and Twyla Tharp gave him leading roles.
