He switched to Port Vale in June 1957, and helped the \"Valiants\" to the Fourth Division title in 1958\u201359.

This started a sequence of just four defeats in seventeen games, which included doing the double over Southampton (a 3\u20130 win at The Dell followed by a 4\u20130 win at Vale Park). This was achieved with Low's attacking policy, a stark contract to 'the Steele Curtain' defence. However their five clean sheets in their first eight games also illustrated their defensive strength. In September, right-half Selwyn Whalley turned part-time, dividing his duties between playing football and teaching at Hanley High School. Winger Alan Bennett was also transferred to Crewe Alexandra. By November, Vale were third in the league, and Low signed Bert Carberry and Jack Wilkinson. Following this top-scorer Stan Steele went off the boil, as the Vale lost their form in the Christmas period, losing 1\u20130 twice to Coventry City in two days.

Strong in attack, the club took until 11 October before failing to score, in a goalless draw with Oldham Athletic witnessed by Shirley Bassey (as a guest of Norman Low). A fortnight later Vale failed to beat Carlisle United, as referee J.G.Williams blew the full-time whistle just as a Jack Wilkinson header was floating into the opposition's net.
