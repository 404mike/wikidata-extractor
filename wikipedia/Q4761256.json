Chris Brown, writing in The Guardian suggested that the pressure affected the players and that it resulted in \"a scrappy goalless match\".  Leyton Orient applied pressure on the Rotherham defence in the early stages with a series of corners and Amara Simba twice missed chances to score.  The second half saw an unmarked Danny Hudson miss with a header from a John Varty cross and the match ended 0\u20130.  The second leg was played three days later at Millmoor in Rotherham.  The game ended goalless in regular time and went into extra time where the deadlock remained, the tie ending 0\u20130 on aggregate so had to be decided by a penalty shootout.  Leyton Orient's goalkeeper Scott Barrett saved penalties from both Andy Roscoe and Paul Hurst, and Matt Lockwood scored the decisive goal to give his side a 4\u20132 win."]}]}}
