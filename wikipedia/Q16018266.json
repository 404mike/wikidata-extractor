He was born at Ramsbottom, Lancashire and died at Rochdale.\nSavage was a right-arm off-break bowler who, unusually for his time, which was an era of increasingly defensive bowling, flighted the ball rather than bowling flat, and a right-handed tail-end batsman. In his first game for Leicestershire in 1953 he hit 31 and 8 not out, and therefore averaged 39.00 with the bat at that point: it proved to be a very false dawn in terms of his batting ability, as he only once surpassed that 31 and his highest score in 17 years was only 33.It was as an off-spin bowler that, having played a few matches over several seasons, he joined the Leicestershire staff in 1957 and was virtually ever-present in the first team for the next 10 seasons, often providing the only spin alternative to a succession of seam bowlers. Within the first month of the 1957 season Savage had achieved what would prove to be his best batting and bowling performances. In his first match of the season, against Yorkshire, he scored 33. And 10 days later he took eight Gloucestershire wickets for 50 runs in the first innings at the Wagon Works Ground, Gloucester. He took 80 wickets at the economical average of 19.46 in 1957, and had a similar return, 93 wickets at 20.08 in 1958. He was awarded his county cap in 1958.\nSavage took 101 wickets in 1959 and repeated the feat of 100 wickets in a season twice more, in 1961 and 1963. His best figures were 122 wickets at an average of 18.93 in 1961 when he also took a hat-trick of three wickets in three balls in the match against Somerset. At the end of the 1961 season he was picked for the Players team in the Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival and took five wickets in the second innings to win the game. He was, wrote Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \"one of the best off-spinners in the country\". At the start of the 1962 season, he was picked for the season opener match between the 1961 county champions, Yorkshire, and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and at the end of the season and in 1964 he appeared in other Scarborough Festival games; these games were his only representative cricket outside county matches, and with off-spinning all-rounders of the calibre of Fred Titmus, David Allen and Ray Illingworth as his contemporaries, he was not close to Test selection.\nAfter 1963, Savage's wicket-taking powers declined and he did not achieve 100 wickets in a season again. By 1966, when Leicestershire were enjoying a revival under new captain Tony Lock, he took only 55 wickets in 27 matches. By this time, the county had recruited another off-spinner in Jack Birkenshaw, and Savage was released at the end of the 1966 season. He then joined his native Lancashire for three seasons, playing regularly in the first two, but retiring from first-class cricket at the age of 40 in 1969. He then remained with Lancashire for a further nine years as a coach and as captain of the second eleven.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Savage", "response": ["John Savage may refer to:", "* John Savage (actor) (born 1949), actor", "* John Savage (Fenian) (1828\u20131888), poet, journalist and author", "* John Savage (engraver) (fl. 1690\u20131700), printseller in London", "* John Savage, central character in the novel The Meadows of the Moon by James Hilton", "* Sir John Savage (1444-1492), 15th-century knight and military commander", "* John Savage, Soldier and co-conspirator in the 1586 Babington Plot to assassinate Elizabeth I of England", "* John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers (1603\u20131654), royalist and nobleman from Cheshire", "* John Savage (American politician, born 1779) (1779\u20131863), Congressman from New York", "* John Savage (Irish politician) (1814\u20131883), mayor of Belfast, Ireland (now Northern Ireland)", "* John Savage (Nova Scotia politician) (1932\u20132003), doctor and Premier of Nova Scotia", "* John Savage (British Columbia politician) (born 1936), Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia", "* John Savage (surveyor), 18th century surveyor for Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron", "* John Savage (cricketer) (1929\u20132008), English cricketer ", "* John Savage (baseball) (born 1965), baseball head coach", "* John Savage, onetime ring name of John Hindley (born 1965), British retired professional wrestler"]}, {"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Change came in the late 1950s with the recruitment of the charismatic Willie Watson at the end of a distinguished career with England and Yorkshire. Watson's run gathering sparked the home-grown Maurice Hallam into becoming one of England's best opening batsmen.

His best season as a wicketkeeper was 1961, when he received his county cap and took 72 catches with 7 stumpings. As a batsman, he scored 561 runs in 1960 with an average of 12.46 and a highest score of just 44: the high aggregate reflects the fact that he went in at No 8 because in Terry Spencer, John Savage and Brian Boshier or Peter Broughton, there were usually three even worse batsmen than he was, and Leicestershire usually batted twice in each match. His highest score, one of only two innings over 50, was 51, made against Worcestershire in 1962 as a high-scoring match petered out to a draw."]}, {"page": "Bernard Cromack", "response": ["In 1960, in a very weak Leicestershire team, Cromack played in 20 first-team matches, often, in a brittle batting line-up, coming in as high as No 6, though he averaged less than 11 runs per innings for the season. With a bowling attack geared towards seam bowling with Terry Spencer and Brian Boshier, and an established spinner in John Savage, Cromack was bowled sparingly, and took only 28 wickets all season. The match against Middlesex at Lord's was his sixth first-class game, but to that point he had taken just two first-class wickets; he took six for 48 in Middlesex's first innings, the best bowling figures of his career. But then Leicestershire had to follow on and when they batted again they squandered a first-wicket partnership of 196 by losing all 10 wickets for a further 18 runs, giving the home team an easy victory. Two weeks later, he scored 55 against Hampshire, his highest score. There was a second half-century at the end of June with 53 in the game against Nottinghamshire. But Cromack's season subsided after that and he was left out of several matches in August."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* John Savage (1961\u20131962) : J.
