He was born at North Curry, Taunton, Somerset and died at Whitby, North Yorkshire.\nBrown was a lower-order batsman and an occasional bowler. It is not known whether he batted left- or right-handed or what his bowling style was. He appeared in one match for Somerset in 1902 with little success, and returned for seven further games in 1905. His only batting success came in the match against Lancashire in 1905, when he made 53 in the second innings, more than double his second highest career score; in this match, the Lancashire bowler Walter Brearley took 17 Somerset wickets, including four wickets in four balls \u2013 the last two of the first innings and the first two of the second innings. Brown was dismissed by Brearley in both innings, and Somerset lost the game by an innings and 160 runs inside two days.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Brown", "response": ["Colin Brown may refer to:", "* Colin Brown (cricketer) (1878\u20131936), Somerset cricketer", "* Colin Brown (RAF officer) (1898\u20131965), World War I flying ace with 14 victories", "* Colin Brown (jockey) (born 1955), English National Hunt jockey active in the 1980s", "* Colin Brown (film journalist) (born 1962), British editor-in-chief of Screen International", "* Colin Brown (political journalist), UK", "* Colin Brown (American football) (born 1985), offensive lineman for the Buffalo Bills", "* Colin Brown (artist), born 1962, Scottish artist"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Colin Brown (1902\u20131905) 8 matches CA"]}]}}
