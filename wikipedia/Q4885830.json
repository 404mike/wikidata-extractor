He settled in quickly at his new club, and put in solid performances at centre-back. Despite injury and suspension hampering his first few months at the \"Shrews\", he still netted four times in sixteen games for the Shropshire club in the latter half of the 2005\u201306 season. After recovering from a short illness he made 33 appearances in 2006\u201307, helping Shrewsbury to secure a play-off place.
