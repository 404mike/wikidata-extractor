He signed Terry Curran as a winger but eventually moved him up front to play alongside McCulloch. He sold goalkeeper Chris Turner to Sunderland and replaced him with the bigger Bob Bolder. He further raised the average height of the team by signing uncompromising centre-half Mick Pickering from Southampton. The team failed to advance in the league, finishing the 1978\u201379 season again in 14th spot. They did make their mark on the FA Cup in the Third Round by taking eventual winners Arsenal to four replays before they eventually succumbed to a 2\u20130 defeat."]}, {"page": "Hallam F.C.", "response": ["*  Mick Pickering"]}, {"page": "Pickering (surname)", "response": ["* Mick Pickering (born 1956), former professional English fotballer"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Mick Pickering||||1983||4||0||"]}, {"page": "Mike Pickering (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mick Pickering"]}, {"page": "Michael Pickering", "response": ["* Mick Pickering (born 1956), English association footballer in the 1970s and 1980s"]}]}}
