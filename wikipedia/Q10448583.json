In 1978, he was part of the Ballymena United team that reached the final of the Irish Cup only to lose to Linfield. His role as a key player in that team earned him a selection for the Northern Irish under-21 team for a match against the Republic of Ireland.\nThat summer, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur were locked in a battle for Sloan's signature, but it was United who eventually won out, paying Ballymena United \u00a320,000 for the transfer. Sloan's influence in the heart of the United midfield was not sufficient for him to earn a regular place in the team, but his four appearances in his first season at Old Trafford were enough to attract a call from the Northern Irish senior team at the end of the season. In the space of 15 days, Sloan won his only three caps; two came in the 1979 British Home Championship, against Scotland and Wales, while the other was a UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying match against Denmark.\nSloan's involvement with the Manchester United first team gradually decreased over the next three seasons \u2013 he made just eight appearances in total in 1979\u201380 and 1980\u201381, and none at all in 1981\u201382 \u2013 and he was released to Chester in July 1982. At Chester, Sloan found his niche, making nearly 50 appearances in the one season he spent there before he returned to Northern Ireland to play for Linfield.\nAfter a three-year stint with Linfield, he was transferred to Carrick Rangers f.c. and then moved on to Coleraine for a further season before moving to his last Irish league club Larne.f.c. He then got reinstated as an amateur and  began to play for Raglan Homers in the Ballymena Sunday Morning League which by the way was his first club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Sloan", "response": ["*Tom Sloan (footballer, born 1880), Scottish international footballer", "*Tom Sloan (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131973), Irish international footballer", "*Tom Sloan (television executive) (1919\u20131970), British television executive, broadcaster, and journalist", "*Tom Sloan (footballer, born 1959), also known as Tommy Sloan, Northern Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "Tom Sloan (footballer born 1959)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Sloan (footballer, born 1959)"]}, {"page": "Manchester United 3\u20135 West Bromwich Albion (1978)", "response": ["|MF ||12|| Tom Sloan || "]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Tom Sloan"]}]}}
