The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Brooks received the Distinguished Service Order, Military Cross, Croix de guerre, and L\u00e9gion d'honneur for his work as a leader of SOE's Pimento network sabotaging German reinforcements prior to and during the Normandy invasion. He later worked for the Foreign Office, and MI5 and MI6.\nOf the more than 400 SOE agents who worked in France during World War II, M.R.D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, named Brooks as one of the half-dozen best male agents.  Brooks is often characterized as the youngest SOE agent in France, but Sonya Butt was younger than he by several months when she arrived in France. In terms of length of time in France, however, Brooks was one of the longest serving SOE agents. He avoided capture by the Germans through strict adherence to security measures and survived the war.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1922 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 April \u2013 Anthony Brooks, soldier and spy (died 2007)"]}, {"page": "2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich", "response": ["The Allied Normandy landings took place on 6 June 1944.

However, the option to move by rail had been preempted by the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The rail cars to be used for transporting the tanks and equipment were unguarded. In the days before 6 June French operatives of the SOE's Pimento network, headed by Anthony Brooks, sabotaged the rail cars by draining the axle oil and replacing it with an abrasive powder that caused the axles of the cars to seize up. The powder had been parachuted in by SOE. The perpetrators of the sabotage were a 16 year old girl named Tetty, her boyfriend, her 14-year old sister, and several of their friends."]}, {"page": "Brooks (surname)", "response": ["*Anthony Brooks (1922\u20132007), British undercover agent"]}, {"page": "2007 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 19 April \u2013 Anthony Brooks, World War II soldier and spy (born 1922)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2007", "response": ["*Anthony Brooks, 85, British agent who led French Resistance saboteurs after the Normandy Invasion, stomach cancer."]}, {"page": "Anthony M.

She went to work as a courier for the Pimiento network, headed by Anthony Brooks, in Toulouse under the new codename Marguerite.  However, de Baissac, ambitious for greater things, was given only trivial tasks. Her aristocratic demeanor was incompatible with the trade unionists and socialists who worked with Pimiento. She said darkly that the network was controlled by \"someone in Switzerland\", rather than SOE in London. By mutual consent, she left Pimiento to join her brother Claude, who had returned to France in February 1944, and the reborn Scientist network he headed which was now working in southern Normandy and adjacent areas.
