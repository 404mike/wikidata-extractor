It was a weekly publication that, in Coleridge's typically ambitious style, was written, edited, and published almost entirely single-handedly. Given that Coleridge tended to be highly disorganised and had no head for business, the publication was probably doomed from the start. Coleridge financed the journal by selling over five hundred subscriptions, over two dozen of which were sold to members of Parliament, but in late 1809, publication was crippled by a financial crisis and Coleridge was obliged to approach \"Conversation Sharp\",For an appraisal of Sharp's role in Coleridge's career, see Knapman, D.

The Friend was an eclectic publication that drew upon every corner of Coleridge's remarkably diverse knowledge of law, philosophy, morals, politics, history, and literary criticism. Although it was often turgid, rambling, and inaccessible to most readers, it ran for 25 issues and was republished in book form a number of times. Years after its initial publication, a revised and expanded edition of The Friend, with added philosophical content including his 'Essays on the Principles of Method', became a highly influential work and its effect was felt on writers and philosophers from John Stuart Mill to Ralph Waldo Emerson."]}, {"page": "1835", "response": ["* March 30 \u2013 Richard Sharp MP, known as 'Conversation Sharp' English merchant, critic, poet, and wit"]}, {"page": "Romsey", "response": ["*Richard Sharp \u2013 banker and Member of Parliament."]}, {"page": "Park Lane", "response": ["In 1741, the Kensington Turnpike Trust took over its maintenance, as coach traffic caused wear on the road surface.
