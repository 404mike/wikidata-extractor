A few days later, Hibs accepted an offer of \u00a33\u00a0million plus incentives based on appearances for Burnley. Fletcher completed the move when he agreed a four-year contract with the Lancashire club, who paid a club record transfer fee to obtain his services. After the move was completed, former Hibs striker Keith Wright questioned whether Fletcher was ready to play in the Premier League. His first competitive goals for Burnley came when he scored a brace in a 2\u20131 League Cup win at Hartlepool United on 25 August. He scored his first goal in the Premier League on 3 October, against Birmingham City. Fletcher was Burnley's top goalscorer during the 2009\u201310 season, but the club were relegated from the Premier League. He was named Burnley Players' Player of the year for the season."]}, {"page": "Scott Brown (footballer, born June 1985)", "response": ["Brown trained with Falkirk during his childhood. Around this time, Rangers also showed an interest, but informed him that he was too small to make the grade. He joined Hibernian aged 13, after he was spotted by their chief scout John Park. His mother Heather would regularly take Scott to Hibernian training sessions in Edinburgh and Motherwell, where he was coached by Gordon Rae and Keith Wright, among others."]}, {"page": "Theo Snelders", "response": ["Midway through the one of the campaigns in which the team was not challenging for honours (1991\u201392), Snelders was sent off for an incident of violent conduct on the pitch; his reaction to a penalty being awarded to Keith Wright of Hibernian was to strike the forward to the head, followed by kicking the ball over the stand and out of the stadium. His makeshift replacement, defender Brian Irvine, saved the spot-kick, only for Aberdeen to miss a penalty of their own and concede the winning goal in the last minute. The other unsuccessful year (1994\u201395) concluded with a play-off to prevent the club being relegated for the first time in their history, which was averted. He made 290 appearances for the club in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Broughton High School, Edinburgh", "response": ["The school is home to a specialised music department: the City of Edinburgh Music School which nearly faced closure in 2018. Along with the music school Broughton has a specialist dance department. Broughton is also one of seven schools in Scotland chosen by the Scottish Football Association to support talented young footballers with extra coaching. As of 2018, the dedicated coach for the young players at Broughton is former Hibernian player Keith Wright."]}, {"page": "Tommy Coyne", "response": ["Halfway through the 1986\u201387 season he was transferred to city rivals Dundee for \u00a375,000 and found his scoring boots again, notching up 9 goals in 20 games in the second half of the season and forming an effective partnership with fellow new signing Keith Wright earning them the nicknames \"The cobra\" and \"the Mongoose\". In the 1987\u201388 season Coyne was top scorer in the Premier Division as he scored 33 goals in 43 matches, a total which earned him third place in the European Golden Boot contest. After scoring 9 goals in 20 matches at the start of the 1988\u201389 season he was sold on to Celtic for \u00a3500,000, the largest transfer fee Dundee had received."]}]}}
