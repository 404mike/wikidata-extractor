At the time, \"he had no intention whatsoever of attacking Washington,\" according to a historian. Nonetheless, he marched on the capital and joined his troops with others who had arrived from Bermuda, led by Rear-Admiral Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet. In spite of a larger contingent of American defenders, the British captured Washington with a force of 4,500 \"battle hardened\" men. On 24 August, the Burning of Washington occurred, as the troops, directed by Ross, set fire to  a number of public buildings, including the White House and the United States Capitol. Extensive damage to the interiors and the contents of both were subsequently reported.

The 4,500 troops, commanded by Major General Robert Ross, successfully captured the capital city on 24 August 1814; Ross then directed the Burning of Washington but refused suggestions by both Cochrane and Cockburn to raze the city. Ross ordered his troops to cause no damage to private property."]}]}}
