A preview trailer was released the following day, with brief clips from the film accompanied by \"I'd Love to Change the World\" by Jetta. Differing from past Terminator releases, the preview had forced-looking camera motion in aerial-effect scenes and a first look at the color grading used to evoke the look of past films.
