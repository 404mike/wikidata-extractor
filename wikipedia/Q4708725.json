Within express trusts this is a particularly complex area, because the test used to determine certainty varies between fixed trusts, mere powers and discretionary trusts.Hudson (2009) p.117 Fixed trusts are trusts for a specific, named list of individuals, with Alastair Hudson giving the example of \"\u00a310,000 to be held upon trust equally for the complete team of 11 Sunderland Football Club players who started the 1992 Cup Final at Wembley\". The test for fixed trusts is that the trustees must be able to give a complete list of the beneficiaries, as laid down in IRC v Broadway Cottages.[1955] Ch 20 If there are any potential beneficiaries who the trustees are not certain of, or the trustees cannot compile a complete list, the trust is void for uncertainty.Hudson (2009) p.120"]}, {"page": "List of University of Southampton people", "response": ["* Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law"]}, {"page": "Hunter v Moss", "response": ["The academic reaction to Hunter was mixed. While some called it \"fair, sensible and workable\", or noted that \"Logically the decision in Hunter v Moss appears a sensible one\", Alastair Hudson felt that \"doctrinally, it is suggested that the decision in Hunter v Moss is wrong and should not be relied upon\", because it contradicted existing property law and drew a distinction between tangible and intangible property he felt to be \"spurious\".", "Alastair Hudson wrote that \"doctrinally, it is suggested that the decision in Hunter v Moss is wrong and should not be relied upon\". Firstly, it contradicts an element of property law which requires there be \"specific and identifiable property\" to be subject to a property right. Secondly, he suggests it is difficult to see why there should be a dividing line between intangible and tangible property, since there are some principles which apply to both.Hudson (2009) p.105 500 ball bearings are tangible, but identical; under Hunter, there is no reason these should also not require separation, so the distinction between tangible and intangible is thus \"spurious\".Hudson (2009) p.106"]}, {"page": "Purpose trusts in English law", "response": ["Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, argues that this is an example of the \"strict\" rule against purpose trusts. A looser application was found in Cocks v Manners,[1871] LR 12 Eq 574 a case with almost identical facts, where the court decided that the trust was valid as a gift to every member of the order individually, with the Mother Superior acting as a trustee.Hudson (2009) p.174"]}, {"page": "Secret trusts in English law", "response": ["Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, suggests the potential for a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.Hudson (2009) p.271", "Alastair Hudson has also argued that the fraud argument is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about as soon as the trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.Hudson (2009) p.289", "Some authors place fully secret and half-secret trusts in different categories, including Alastair Hudson and Lionel Astor Sheridan. To this it has been argued that, if the \"outside the will\" theory is the true basis for the secret trust, whether the mention of the existence of the trust on the face of the will should affect its nature. In Hudson's opinion, fully secret trusts are constructive trusts, because they exist to prevent fraud. But sometimes they are express trusts, if \"au dehor\" doctrine is concerned. Half-secret trusts are constructive trust, because their mention in wills makes fraud unlikely; they are instead in line with a constructive notice, e.g. the use of sealed document.Hudson (2009) p.291 The House of Lords in Blackwell v Blackwell,[1929] AC 318 however, considered the half-secret trust to have the same basis as the fully secret trust."]}, {"page": "Resulting trusts in English law", "response": ["The theoretical justification for resulting trusts was discussed by the Privy Council, in Air Jamaica v Charlton,[1999] 1 WLR 1399 where Lord Millet said that \"Like a constructive trust, a resulting trust arises by operation of law, though unlike a constructive trust it gives effect to intention. But it arises whether or not the transferor intended to retain a beneficial interest - he almost always does not - since it responds to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the recipient\". Resulting trusts were intended to fill in the gap left by a veiled transfer, obeying the equitable maxim that \"equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy\".Edwards (2007) p.257 In Westdeutsche Landesbank, Browne-Wilkinson stated that resulting trusts \"are traditionally regarded as examples of trusts giving effect to the common intention of the parties. A resulting trust is not imposed by law against the intentions of the trustee (as in a constructive trust) but gives effect to his presumed intention\". Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, argues that Browne-Wilkinson's theory is flawed, primarily because if the trust can not be enforced against the trustee's wishes, it is a form of constructive trust.Hudson (2009) p.457 Much of the case law is instead based on Megarry's classification.Hudson (2009) p.459"]}, {"page": "Constructive trusts in English law", "response": ["Where acts lead to profit and are illegal, under either English criminal law or an established legal principle, equity puts any property acquired through these acts into a constructive trust. The most common type of trust here is one resulting from bribery; where somebody in a fiduciary office makes unlawful profit, that money is held on constructive trust for the beneficiaries of his office. In Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Hong Kong accepted bribes to not prosecute certain people. The court held that this was a violation of fiduciary duty, and put the money on constructive trust. An issue with this principle is that the position of Director of Public Prosecutions is not normally understood to be a fiduciary one. Rather, the courts are using fiduciary duties as a method of punishing the defendant; Alastair Hudson writes that they are \"as concerned to punish the wrongdoer as to protect rights in property\"."]}, {"page": "Quistclose trusts in English law", "response": ["Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, stated that the contract gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if the purpose of the loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors."]}, {"page": "Discretionary trusts and powers in English law", "response": ["Normal express trusts are \"fixed\" trusts; the property is held for a fixed number of beneficiaries, and the trustee is obliged to distribute property without any discretion over who gets what.Hudson (2009) p.119 In a discretionary trust, however, the trustee has discretion over his actions, although he is obliged to use it. Alastair Hudson gives the example of a trust \"that [the trustee] shall divide the \u00a31,000 between any of my sons who become unemployed, with the power to retain the whole of that \u00a31,000 for the remainder beneficiary\". This is a discretionary trust; the word \"shall\" means the trustee is forced to exercise his power, while the \"power to retain the whole of that \u00a31,000\" gives him discretion over whether to retain the money. Discretionary trusts are regularly used, because they provide flexibility; in this situation, for example, the money could be retained and redistributed in a different form if one beneficiary develops some urgent need for it.Hudson (2009) p.125 They also help protect the trust fund. In fixed trusts, the potential beneficiaries have the equitable ownership of their property; in discretionary trusts, this is not the case. Because of this, the property cannot be made liable for their debts or controlled by them.Edwards (2007) p.125"]}]}}
