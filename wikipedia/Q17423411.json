By the 1860s, Beverly's work as a scene painter displaced the costume change bringing in the harlequinade in some productions. The extravaganza became differentiated from the pantomime by, among other things, the centrality of a \"magical transformation scene\" and the diminishing of the harlequinade clowning. Some British and American Victorian burlesques also retained a transformation scene."]}, {"page": "William Beverly", "response": ["* William Roxby Beverly (1810\u20131889), English theatrical scene painter"]}, {"page": "Alfred Maltby", "response": ["Maltby studied costume design in Paris at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and began his theatrical career as a costume designer, starting with an 1872 Christmas production of The Black Crook at the Alhambra Theatre, London. The piece received poor reviews, but the costumes were warmly praised: The Morning Post observed, \"Anything more perfect as to design and colour \u2013 so perfect, it may possibly be said \u2013 has never been seen on the stage\".\"The Alhambra Theatre\", The Morning Post, 24 December 1872, p. 6 Maltby was then engaged by F. B. Chatterton at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he worked on Shakespeare productions together with the scene painter, William Roxby Beverly. Maltby's designs continued to impress reviewers. In 1875 The Era praised \"the genius he has displayed in the designs for grotesque, gorgeous and elaborate costumes\".\"Provincial Theatricals\", The Era, 17 January 1875, p. 6 A later reviewer praised his \"wonderful originality and the most exquisite taste \u2026 almost literally enchanting\".\"The Christmas Novelties\", The Era, 2 January 1876, p. 12 Maltby became much sought after, and recalled that in one Christmas season he designed the costumes for shows at twelve different theatres."]}]}}
