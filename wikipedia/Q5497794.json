He was a right-handed batsman who played for Nottinghamshire. He was born in Nottingham and died in Beltinge, Herne Bay.\nFox made two first-class appearances during the 1890 season, the inaugural season of the County Championship. He scored 23 of his 34 career runs in the second innings of his debut match, however, batting from the lower order in both of his games, he made little more of an imprint on the Nottinghamshire team's performances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fox (surname)", "response": ["* Frederick Fox (cricketer) (1863\u20131935), English cricketer", "* Frederick Fox (disambiguation), multiple people", "* Frederick Fox (milliner) (1931\u20132013), Australian-born English milliner"]}, {"page": "Frederick Fox", "response": ["Frederick Fox may refer to:", "* Frederick Fox (cricketer) (1863\u20131935), English cricketer", "* Frederick Fox (milliner) (1931\u20132013), Australian-born English milliner"]}]}}
