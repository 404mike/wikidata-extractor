A versatile player and former England under-21 international, he is able to play as a full back or across the midfield, and has excellent free-kick taking and dead ball skills.\nTaylor began his career at Tranmere Rovers in 2002, and made 122 league and cup appearances in three full seasons with the club, being voted as Tranmere's Player of the Year and onto the PFA Team of the Year in 2004\u201305. He was sold to Premier League club Wigan Athletic in July 2005 for a fee of \u00a3750,000. Injuries restricted his appearances, though after scoring in four consecutive matches against Newcastle United he joined the club in a trade deal in January 2009. After Newcastle dropped out of the top-flight, Taylor helped the club to win promotion as champions of the Championship in 2009\u201310. However he then faced a catalogue of injuries, firstly fracturing a metatarsal and then breaking a leg in the 2010\u201311 season, and then picking up a serious cruciate knee ligament injury in August 2012.\nTaylor played a total of 106 matches for Newcastle, though featured just 18 times in his final three seasons. He was released by Newcastle in May 2015, and spent the 2015\u201316 campaign at Hull City, where he made only occasional cameo appearances. He signed with Port Vale in October 2016 and again in March 2017. He signed with Indian Super League club ATK in December 2017. He returned to England and signed with Fleetwood Town in September 2018. He ended his 17 year career in the English Football League at the end of the season, having scored 42 goals in 350 competitive appearances. He came out of retirement in October 2020 to play for non-League side Colne and moved on to Buxton in January 2022.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 19", "response": ["*  1984   \u2013 Ryan Taylor, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Kirkby", "response": ["*Ryan Taylor - Former Newcastle United F.C.

Chris Hughton was made caretaker manager until a replacement could be found, even though results were worsening under the Irishman, they lost all their matches and went out of the League Cup to Tottenham Hotspur. Towards the end of September, Joe Kinnear, who four years previous was in charge of Nottingham Forest, was made interim manager. Kinnear's first media conference was an explicit one, and the Daily Mirror's Simon Bird was infamously singled out. After this, Hughton was put in charge of the national interviews, with Kinnear handling the local media. Results still didn't get any better, with the club in the relegation zone, further misery was compounded when they lost the Tyne\u2013Wear derby for the first time in twenty-eight years. Kinnear's job title was uncertain; it initially appeared that there might be an permanent successor to Keegan, but as the weeks went on, this was becoming more and more uncertain. Finally, Kinnear signed a contract with club until the end of the season. In the January transfer window, Kinnear signed Kevin Nolan, Peter L\u00f8venkrands and Ryan Taylor, all of whom would make significant contributions the following season. However, he would also fall out with Charles N'Zogbia, who was reportedly angered by Kinnear's mispronunciation of his name. N'Zogbia left to join Wigan Athletic in a swap deal, which saw Taylor arrive at St James'. When Kinnear felt unwell before a match against West Bromwich Albion, Hughton would again take charge and guided the club to their first win in two months. From then on, Hughton was named as acting manager until Kinnear's return, although it was unclear when exactly this would be, as he had triple heart bypass surgery. But Hughton could not stop the slide, failing to win any of Newcastle's four league matches in March, and in April, Shearer was appointed interim manager until the end of the season. Shearer's inexperience as manager was laid bare: in the eight matches he had to save the club, he only managed one win \u2013 in the Tyne\u2013Tees derby. Indiscipline also did not help, as Newcastle finished each of the last four games of the season with ten men; Shearer notably fell out with Barton after a rash tackle on Liverpool's Xabi Alonso. Newcastle travelled to Aston Villa on the final day of the season needing a win to stay up, but a Damien Duff own goal saw Newcastle succumb to defeat and end their sixteen-year stay in the Premier League."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Wigan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["On 15 November, Wigan travelled to St James' Park to face Newcastle United.

Wigan still looked in control of the game for large periods despite missing key men such as Emile Heskey and Amr Zaki, but were undone with the arrival of Michael Owen. It was Owen's attacking threat that eventually broke through and pulled Newcastle level on the 80th minute; seven minutes later, Owen's striker partner Obafemi Martins scored to put Newcastle in a seemingly unassailable position with minutes remaining.
