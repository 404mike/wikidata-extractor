His father was from King's County and his mother (n\u00e9e O'Connor) from County Wexford. After showing a talent for drawing he studied art at an academy in Dublin, but grew increasingly more interested in the theatre. After a two-year period in London, where he became an admirer of David Garrick, he settled on a career as an actor and playwright.Hager (2005), p. 181\u2013182. O'Keeffe wrote his first play The She Gallant when he was twenty, and it was performed in Dublin at the Smock Alley Theatre. In Cork, in late September 1774, O'Keeffe married Mary Heaphy, a Protestant actress and the daughter of Tottenham Heaphy, manager of the Dublin Theatre Royal.Hager (2005) p. 182. The marriage ended badly when O'Keeffe discovered that she was having an affair with the Scottish actor George Graham. O'Keeffe left Ireland with their children, and Mary was denied access to her son and daughter, John Tottenham O'Keeffe and Adelaide O'Keeffe.Clare L. Taylor: 'O'Keeffe, Adelaide (1776\u20131865)', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004); online edn, May 2009, accessed 20 Jan 2017. Mary Heaphy, according to Adelaide O'Keeffe's memoir of her father, married Graham without first divorcing her husband. She did not consider her marriage to the Catholic John O'Keeffe to be sufficiently binding.", "O'Keeffe had problems with his eyes ever since he had fallen into the River Liffey in his youth. From the mid-1770s, O'Keeffe increasingly lost his sight, and from 1781 his plays had to be dictated by him. In spite of this, he was a prolific writer and was the most-frequently produced playwright in London in the last quarter of the 18th century. O'Keeffe contributed many Irish folksongs to the musical scores by Samuel Arnold and Shield such as I am a Friar of Orders Grey and The Thorn are still popular.Klein (2005), p. 31\u201334. For many of these songs, the comic operas are the earliest source.Fleischmann (1998). From 1788, his only daughter Adelaide became his amanuensis and eventual caretaker until his death. Adelaide O'Keeffe was a popular novelist and an important children's poet who authored the first children's novel in verse, A Trip to the Coast (1819).For additional information on Adelaide O'Keeffe's importance as a children's poet, see Donelle Ruwe British Children's Poetry: Verse, Riddle, and Rhyme (Palgrave Macmillan, 2014).

In 1826, O'Keeffe wrote his memoirs, which covered his life experiences and various interactions with the leading artistic figures of his day. The memoirs were dictated to his daughter Adelaide who oversaw their publication. The same year he was awarded a pension by George IV. However, much of the information in his memoir is not accurate.Boydell (2006). In the year following his death, Adelaide O'Keeffe completed her own memoir of her father; \"Memoir\" prefaced her edited collection of his poetry, O'Keeffe's Legacy to His Daughter, Being the Poetic Works of the Late John O'Keeffe, Esq., the Dramatic Author. He died in 1833 in Southampton and was buried there.Baines p.256"]}, {"page": "Ann Taylor (poet)", "response": ["Original Poems for Infant Minds by several young persons (by Ann and Jane, Adelaide O'Keeffe, and others) was first issued in 1804, and when it proved successful, a second volume followed in 1805. Adelaide O'Keeffe authored over 30 of the poems in the collection, though she has rarely received full credit for this. Ann Taylor's verse \"My Mother\" became a sentimental favourite. It was republished throughout the 19th century and was still being memorized as a standard recital work into the mid-20th century. Donelle Ruwe traces the publishing history of \"My Mother,\" beginning in 1807 when the poem was first published as a stand-alone, single-volume work. The 1807 \"My Mother\" featured illustrations by Peltro Williams Tomkins. While Tomkins was inspired by the attitudes of Lady Emma Hamilton, later illustrators of \"My Mother,\" such as Walter Crane in 1873, reflected changing ideologies of motherhood as well as the artistic style of the Arts and Crafts Movement.Donelle Ruwe, \"Poetry in Picturebooks\", in Routledge Companion to Picturebooks. Ed. Bettina Kummerling-Meibauer. Routledge, 2018, pp. 246\u2013259. Other poems of hers from Original Poems for Infant Minds are also significant. Ruwe identifies Ann's \"The Sign-Post\" as an interesting example of the clash between Romantic-era Gothic literature for adults and the different expectations of children's texts. As Ruwe notes in an essay, \"The Rational Gothic,\" it manages to tell a Gothic tale \u2013 of a boy terrified by a ghostly sign-post \u2013 but concludes with a series of moral lessons about the importance of checking for evidence instead of bowing to irrational fears.Donelle Ruwe, \"The Rational Gothic: The Case of Ann Taylor's 'The Hand-Post'\" in Aesthetics of Children's Poetry.

As Donelle Ruwe writes in her study of its genesis and reception history, it was issued as a single-volume work in 1804, and when it proved successful, further poems were solicited for an additional volume, which was published in 1805. Over time, the collection became associated with the Taylor family. Although O'Keeffe wrote to the publisher requesting a greater percentage of the collection's proceeds, Darton and Harvey deferred to the Taylor family regarding all editorial decisions.
