For the 1910 general election, the East Glamorganshire Liberal and Labour Association selected Clement Edwards. Edwards had solid Lib-Lab credentials - a barrister who had represented trade unions in major cases, he was also personally active in organising trade unions and industrial action. But Edwards was not a socialist, and he was opposed to a separate Labour Party.Duncan Tanner, (Allen) Clement Edwards in Dictionary of National Biography online, OUP 2004\u201310.", "At the general election in December 1910, Clement Edwards comfortably won the seat, the Conservative candidate took second place, while Stanton finished third : Edwards (Lib-Lab) 9,088; Gaskell (Con) 5,603; Stanton (Lab) 4,675. In his speech at the declaration, Stanton said that \"Although defeated, he was by no means downhearted, as he realised that he was preaching a new gospel for which the electors were evidently not prepared, but the day would come when his views would be much more acceptable.The Aberdare Leader, 17 December 1910, p. 8; The Cardiff Times, 17 December 1910, p. 8.", "Stanton's failure at the 1922 general election was shared by the nine other MPs seeking to hold seats they had won in the \"coupon\" election of 1918 under the National Democratic and Labour Party banner.

The book was considered a 'detailed' 'study of the institutions of ancient Welsh Christianity'.Church Quarterly Review, vol. 45, 1898, p. 151 Willis-Bund was referred to by the Welsh politician Clement Edwards in a 1914 House of Commons debate on the Established Church in Wales as 'a great authority... one of the greatest authorities on the history of the old Welsh Church'.
