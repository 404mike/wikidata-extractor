It had a new book adapted by Horton Foote and was rechristened Gone with the Wind. The West End version, produced by Harold Fielding and again directed by Joe Layton, opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with a cast headed by June Ritchie, Harve Presnell, Patricia Michael, and Robert Swann. There was an attempt to trim the show's length to the standard 2.5 hours for a stage show in the West but it still ran close to four hours long. The majority of reviews praised Ritchie's Scarlett and were duly impressed by Layton's staging; however, they criticized Foote's adaptation of the story, which relied heavily on the audience's prior knowledge of the characters and plot and as a result was sketchy in its presentation of both.  Still, Fielding was encouraged enough to announce a Broadway opening for April 7, 1974."]}, {"page": "Robert Swann", "response": ["Robert Swann may refer to:", "*Robert Swann, co-founder of Alphamosaic", "*Robert Swann (land trust pioneer) (1918\u20132003), founder of the E.
