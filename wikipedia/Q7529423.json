On the death of Sir John Wynn in 1719, his direct heiress Jane Thelwall inherited the Wynnstay estate and the claim to the Aberffraw legacy, and her husband Watkins Williams adopted the \"Wynn\" family name (thought to be derived from Gwynedd) in honour of his wife's princely heritage.\nSir David continues to live within the bounds of lower Gwynedd, in Cefn Meiriadog, St. Asaph, Denbighshire, Wales and takes an active part in local and country life, being appointed High Sheriff of Clwyd for 1990 And acting as President of the Denbigh & Flint Agricultural Show in 1992. His son is Charles Edward Watkin Williams-Wynn (born 1970), (who might be known as Iorwerth I, the name Edward translated into Welsh).", "link_mentions": {}}}
