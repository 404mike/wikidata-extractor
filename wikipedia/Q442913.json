Ethics. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 41. The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's categorical imperative: \"act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\"Kant I. \"The Categorical Imperative\" in P Singer (ed). Ethics. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 274. Kant considered critical conscience to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss.Kant I. \"The Doctrine of Virtue\" in Metaphyics and Morals. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. 1991. pp. 183 and 233\u201334. Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical examination of Rousseau's work considered that conscience was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; \"the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature.\"John Plamenatz.
