They were executed cumulatively between 1847 and 1852, as the Museum obtained fresh scientific sponsors. Some were made by the artist from life, and others from photographic portraits or (in the case of the Revd William Kirby) from an oil portrait. The exact total of this series is slightly above 60 because some (e.g. Edwin Lankester) were re-drawn. Copies of the lithographs were given to subscribing members of the Museum, and a bound portfolio copy of the series was presented by Professor J.S. Henslow to Prince Albert when he inspected the Museum on the occasion of the 1851 Ipswich Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. George Ransome resigned his position as founding Secretary of the Museum in 1852 and the cumulative series was then discontinued. His drawing of William John Burchell dated 1854 was engraved by M. & N. Hanhart.\nThe complete name list is: His Royal Highness Prince Albert, \nGeorge Biddell Airy, \nGeorge Allman, \nDavid Thomas Ansted, \nRobert Ball, \nSir Henry T. de la Beche, \nThomas Bell, \nSir John Boileau, \nCharles Lucien Bonaparte, \nJames Scott Bowerbank, \nThe Marquis of Bristol, \nRobert Brown, \nVery Rev.
