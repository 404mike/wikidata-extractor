She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later Sunday Express articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to tell she was not wearing trousers.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 185\u2013191. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and short skirts was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the \"severely masculine\" look.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 114\u2013117 and passim. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style as a way of signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read.Langer, 45 and Elliott, 74. With the controversy over The Well of Loneliness, Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 27, 193. Lesbian journalist Evelyn Irons\u00a0\u2013 who considered Hall's style of dress \"rather effeminate\" compared to her own\u00a0\u2013 said that after the publication of The Well, truck drivers would call out on the street to any woman who wore a collar and tie: \"Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall\".Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 113, 123. Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 124\u2013125. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of The Well because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.Bullough, 897."]}, {"page": "1900 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 17 June \u2013 Evelyn Irons, Scottish-born journalist, war correspondent (died 2000)"]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: I\u2013J", "response": ["| Evelyn Irons"]}, {"page": "Irons", "response": ["* Evelyn Irons (1900\u20132000), a Scottish journalist"]}, {"page": "Stanhope Medal", "response": ["*Evelyn Irons (1935) \u2013 first woman recipient"]}, {"page": "1900 in Scotland", "response": ["* 17 June \u2013 Evelyn Irons, journalist, war correspondent (died 2000)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2000", "response": ["*Evelyn Irons, 99,  Scottish journalist and war correspondent."]}, {"page": "Edith Shackleton Heald", "response": ["Heald was a \"pioneering reporter\" and a special correspondent for the London Evening Standard, and also wrote for the Daily Express, the Sunday Express and the Daily Sketch.
