He had a brief spell as joint caretaker manager of Hartlepool with Paul Baker in 1999, managed at non-league level, and set up his own coaching school.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Brian Honour", "* 1986  Brian Honour", "* 1991  Brian Honour", "* 1993  Brian Honour"]}, {"page": "Keith Houchen", "response": ["He left Vale Park on a free transfer in June 1993 and turned down a move to Cyprus outfit AC Omonia to return to former club Hartlepool United. Injury meant he did not play for the man who signed him, Viv Busby, and instead he made his second debut for the club under John MacPhail. Houchen went on to score eight goals in 37 games as Hartlepool were relegated into the bottom tier of the Football League in 1993\u201394, finishing a massive 17 points behind Blackpool, who were one point above the relegation zone. MacPhail was quickly sacked and replaced by David McCreery; MacPhail blamed the fact that the club was sometimes unable to pay the player's wages as a reason for poor results on the field. Houchen was a coach at the club, but quickly fell out with temporary 'advisory coach' Sandy Clark. Houchen scored a hat-trick against Bury, though was later sent off in the match for allegedly swearing at referee Kevin Lynch; at the time of the incident Houchen was receiving treatment for knee ligament damage which would keep him out of action for six weeks. McCreery resigned on 20 April 1995, and chairman Harold Hornsey appointed Houchen as his replacement; he became the 23rd manager at the club in 38 years. He appointed his former boss Billy Horner as youth team coach and also employed Brian Honour and Mick Tait. His first game in charge was a 4\u20130 home win over Hereford United, and a 3\u20130 defeat at Preston North End and a final day 3\u20132 victory over Mansfield Town ensured Hartlepool an 18th-place finish. As a player, he was the club's top scorer with 14 goals in 39 appearances in 1994\u201395, and was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters."]}]}}
