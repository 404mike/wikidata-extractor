They recruited Pete Jostins (Bass), Shaun Foreman (Guitar & Keyboards) and Colin Meech (Drums), with various others contributing in their early days.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate,  They were initially influenced by fairly standard indie bands such as A Certain Ratio and Shriekback. Their first releases were two self-financed singles, \"Jane's Third Party\" and the To You, With Regard EP, in 1980 and 1981 respectively. The latter was recorded with the core line up of McGuire and Jostins plus new guitarist Simon Childs, this trio constituted the band on all further releases. Together with two well received John Peel radio seasons, they were sufficiently successful to attract major-label interest from CBS and Virgin Records. After a further single (Traffic Tax Scheme) on their own 'Chant' label they signed a deal with Warners subsidiary Blanco y Negro, debuting on the label in 1986 with eight versions of the single \"Sing Song\". After releasing the Spacemate package - a double LP, book, poster, set of cards and instruction manual, packaged together in a soap box container and designed by Jon Wozencroft, the band moved on to indie label Rough Trade Records, where they would stay for the rest of their career. Their fondness for short songs was evident on their first Rough Trade release, a 7-inch EP featuring eight, 1 minute songs and titled \"Autumn Cut Back Job Lot Offer\", released in early 1987. The following year, they released their second album, '76 Kids Forever, which they described as a \"soap opera musical\". The band continued for one final effort, 1990's Ko-Opera album, a very different proposition as they utilized contemporary dance beats to deconstruct early 90s consumerism. Sadly this was the swansong and the band split up soon after, with an unheard and unreleased album (minus Simon Childs) in the can."]}, {"page": "Cendre", "response": ["*Jon Wozencroft \u2013 photography and cover design"]}, {"page": "Red Barked Tree", "response": ["While it took the band three months to come up with a title for their last album they almost immediately agreed on naming the current record Red Barked Tree.
