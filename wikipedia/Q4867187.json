Hiley (born 1935), is a British quantum physicist and professor emeritus of the University of London.\nLong-time colleague of David Bohm, Hiley is known for his work with Bohm on implicate orders and for his work on algebraic descriptions of quantum physics in terms of underlying symplectic and orthogonal Clifford algebras. Hiley co-authored the book The Undivided Universe with David Bohm, which is considered the main reference for Bohm's interpretation of quantum theory.\nThe work of Bohm and Hiley has been characterized as primarily addressing the question \"whether we can have an adequate conception of the reality of a quantum system, be this causal or be it stochastic or be it of any other nature\" and meeting the scientific challenge of providing a mathematical description of quantum systems that matches the idea of an implicate order.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory", "response": ["The theory was historically developed in the 1920s by de Broglie, who, in 1927, was persuaded to abandon it in favour of the then-mainstream Copenhagen interpretation. David Bohm, dissatisfied with the prevailing orthodoxy, rediscovered de Broglie's pilot-wave theory in 1952. Bohm's suggestions were not then widely received, partly due to reasons unrelated to their content, such as Bohm's youthful communist affiliations.F. David Peat, Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm (1997), p. 133. James T. Cushing, Quantum Mechanics: Historical Contingency and the Copenhagen Hegemony (1994) discusses \"the hegemony of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics\" over theories like Bohmian mechanics as an example of how the acceptance of scientific theories may be guided by social aspects. The de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory was widely deemed unacceptable by mainstream theorists, mostly because of its explicit non-locality. Bell's theorem (1964) was inspired by Bell's discovery of Bohm's work; he wondered whether the theory's obvious nonlocality could be eliminated. Since the 1990s, there has been renewed interest in formulating extensions to de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, attempting to reconcile it with special relativity and quantum field theory, besides other features such as spin or curved spatial geometries.David Bohm and Basil J.

As a postgraduate at Berkeley, he developed a theory of plasmas, discovering the electron phenomenon now known as Bohm diffusion.D. Bohm: The characteristics of electrical discharges in magnetic fields, in: A.\u00a0Guthrie, R.\u00a0K. Wakerling (eds.), McGraw\u2013Hill, 1949. His first book, Quantum Theory, published in 1951, was well received by Einstein, among others. But Bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book. Starting from the realization that the WKB approximation of quantum mechanics leads to deterministic equations and convinced that a mere approximation could not turn a probabilistic theory into a deterministic theory, he doubted the inevitability of the conventional approach to quantum mechanics.Maurice A. de Gosson, Basil J.

David Peat: Science, Order, and Creativity, 1987 In the view of Bohm and Hiley, \"things, such as particles, objects, and indeed subjects\" exist as \"semi-autonomous quasi-local features\" of an underlying activity. Such features can be considered to be independent only up to a certain level of approximation in which certain criteria are fulfilled. In that picture, the classical limit for quantum phenomena, in terms of a condition that the action function is not much greater than Planck's constant, indicates one such criterion. They used the word \"holomovement\" for the activity in such orders.Basil J. Hiley: Process and the Implicate Order: their relevance to Quantum Theory and Mind.

In algebraic terms, the quantum potential can be seen as arising from the relation between implicate and explicate orders: if a non-commutative algebra is employed to describe the non-commutative structure of the quantum formalism, it turns out that it is impossible to define an underlying space, but that rather \"shadow spaces\" (homomorphic spaces) can be constructed and that in so doing the quantum potential appears.Maurice A. de Gosson: \"The Principles of Newtonian and Quantum Mechanics \u2013 The Need for Planck's Constant, h\", Imperial College Press, World Scientific Publishing, 2001, B.
