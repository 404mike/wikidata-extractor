This was due to a flourishing tradition of folk dance, mummers plays and folk song, but also in part because of the rural nature of the county in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and yet its relatively close proximity to London. It was thus a rich and convenient place for the collectors of the first folk song revival, including Kate Lee, Lucy Broadwood and W. P. Merrick.W. P. Merrick, Folk Songs from Sussex (English Folk Dance and Song Society, 1953). Sussex material was used by the composers of the English pastoral school, for example in Percy Grainger\u2019s arrangement of \u2018The Sussex Mummers' Christmas Carol\u2019, Ralph Vaughan Williams' use of the tune \u2018Monk's Gate\u2019 as a setting for John Bunyan\u2019s \u2018To be a Pilgrim\u2019 and George Butterworth\u2019s arrangement of 'Folk Songs from Sussex'.J. R. Watson, T. Dudley-Smith, An Annotated Anthology of Hymns (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 108. Most important of the collector's sources were the Copper Family of Rottingdean, who emerged as authorities on folk song and eventually as major recording artists.Copper Family Website, http://www.thecopperfamily.com/index.html, retrieved 13/02/09. Sussex folk song also had a formative effect on one of the major figures of the second revival, as it was as a child of five in Sussex that A. L. Lloyd first heard folk music.E. D. Gregory, 'A. L. Lloyd and the English Folk Song Revival, 1934\u201344', Canadian Journal for Traditional Music (1997). Other performers include Scan Tester, Henry Burstow and the sisters Dolly and Shirley Collins. Sussex songs were also the foundation of the repertoire of the influential Young Tradition.Obituaries, 'Bob Copper', 1 April 2004, The Independent, .

Probably because of the presence of the Broadwoods in the area, most of the traditional Sussex music collected in the early days of the folk revival came from around Horsham. Classical musicians who also explored the Sussex repertoire include Percy Grainger and Ralph Vaughan Williams.  Grainger was rather cavalier in his appropriation of the folk melodies he recorded from all over the world, including arrangements of old Sussex tunes such as The Merry King and the Sussex Mummers' Christmas Carol.
