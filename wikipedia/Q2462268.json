His attacking excursions down the right wing sometimes caused concern to his team's supporters but probably more to his opponents.\nAfter service in the Royal Navy during World War II he became a milkman and played in local league football, signing professional for Stockport County at the relatively late age of 22. When the Stockport manager Andy Beattie moved to Huddersfield Town in the 1952 close season, Staniforth followed. Huddersfield had just been relegated. Staniforth, together with all the remainder of the defence, played in every game in the following season in which Huddersfield finished in second place and so were promoted back to the First Division.\nIn their first season back, Huddersfield maintained their momentum and were challenging for the championship. This led to Staniforth playing three times for England 'B' and then gaining eight England caps, all in 1954, including three in the final stages of the World Cup. He was also in the England side which notoriously lost 7\u20131 to Hungary although this did not lead to his losing his place.\nIn 1955 Huddersfield were becoming concerned about the ageing profile of their team and Staniforth was dropped after being given the run-around by Bobby Mitchell in a quarter-final of the F.A. Cup. In July 1955 he moved to Sheffield Wednesday, along with Roy Shiner, in an exchange deal which brought Tony Conwell and Jackie Marriott to Huddersfield (they were respectively eight and four years younger).\nAt the age of 31, however, Staniforth's career was far from over. It must have seemed like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Like his arrival at Huddersfield, Wednesday had just been relegated from the First Division and were promoted in his first season. Also he teamed up again with former Huddersfield defender Don McEvoy. He went on to make 102 appearances for Wednesday over four seasons, during which they were promoted twice and relegated once.\nIn October 1959 he moved to Barrow as player-manager, later to be joined by McEvoy as a player. He retired from playing after 38 games and resigned as manager in 1964. Later he had two spells on the coaching staff at Hillsborough.\nHe died in Barrow on 5 October 1988, aged 64.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Huddersfield Town A.F.C.", "response": ["* Ron Staniforth"]}, {"page": "Newton Heath", "response": ["The area has produced a number of notable footballers who has distinguished careers in both the national and international game. Jimmy Collinson played for Newton Heath F.C.; George Lydon, Nobby Lawton, Cyril Barlow, Harold Hardman, played for Manchester United; Charlie Harrison played for the Bolton Wanderers; Ron Staniforth, who played in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, was born in the town and went on to play 107 games for Sheffield Wednesday. More recently, former Manchester United footballer Ronnie Wallwork and Blackpool F.C.

Huddersfield were relegated to Division Two for the first time in their history but Beattie, then one of the youngest managers in the Football League, and who had now nailed two lucky horseshoes to his office wall, was already planning ahead. During the summer months he was to make three crucial signings. Full-back Ron Staniforth and utility player Tommy Cavanagh followed him across the Pennines from Stockport County, whilst inside forward Jimmy Watson came down from Motherwell to pep up the attack.", "Under Andy Beattie, Huddersfield Town performed strongly in Division Two; during 1952\u201353 Town and Sheffield United left the rest behind with United eventually pipping Town for the title by two points as both Yorkshire clubs gained promotion. Along the way Huddersfield had also recorded an 8\u20132 thrashing of Everton, a 6\u20130 beating of Barnsley, and 5\u20130 wins over Lincoln City and Southampton. The entire defence of Jack Wheeler, Ron Staniforth, Laurie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Don McEvoy and Len Quested played in every fixture, as did winger Vic Metcalfe, while 30-goal top scoring centre forward Jimmy Glazzard missed only one match as Town gained an immediate return to the top flight."]}, {"page": "Bill McGarry", "response": ["\"Terriers\" manager George Stephenson bought McGarry to play in a defensive partnership with Laurie Kelly. He built a reputation as a tough-tackling, sturdy wing-half, and featured ten times towards the end of the 1950\u201351 season. He then scored twice in 43 games in 1951\u201352, as Huddersfield suffered relegation. New boss Andy Beattie led the club to immediate promotion out of the Second Division with a second-place finish in 1952\u201353. McGarry played all 44 games, in an extremely settled defence that featured himself, Kelly, Don McEvoy, Len Quested, Ron Staniforth, and goalkeeper Jack Wheeler; remarkably, the six men played every minute of the campaign, and had the best defensive record in the Football League with just 33 goals conceded in 42 league games. Town's solid defence then helped them to finish third in the top-flight in 1953\u201354, just six points behind champions Wolverhampton Wanderers; McGarry was again an ever-present, scoring four goals in 43 appearances. He then scored once in 38 games in 1954\u201355, as Town posted a 12th-place finish. He then scored four goals in 41 games in 1955\u201356, as their once solid defence leaked goals and cost them relegation as they finished below 20th place Aston Villa on goal average. Bill Shankly took charge at Leeds Road in November 1956, and took the club to 12th in the Second Division in 1956\u201357; he kept faith with McGarry, who scored twice in 36 appearances. He scored six goals in 36 games in 1957\u201358, as Huddersfield rose slightly to ninth place. His goal tally included a successfully converted penalty in the 7\u20136 defeat to Charlton Athletic at The Valley on 21 December; ten-man Charlton came back from 5\u20131 down in what The Guardian described as \"the most remarkable comeback in football history\". They then dropped down to 14th in 1958\u201359, with McGarry scoring four goals in 32 games. He scored once in 38 games in 1959\u201360; Town posted a sixth-place finish under new boss Eddie Boot, who took charge after Shankly left the club to manage Liverpool. McGarry scored once in 20 appearances in 1960\u201361, as Town dropped down to 20th place."]}, {"page": "Staniforth", "response": ["*Ron Staniforth, footballer"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 British Home Championship", "response": ["* DF - Ron Staniforth", "| DF ||align=\"left\"| Ron Staniforth || 13 April 1924 || 1 || 0 || 90 || 0 || 0 || - || - ||bgcolor=red| 90 ||align=\"left\"|  Huddersfield Town"]}]}}
