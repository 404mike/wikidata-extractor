The band comprised vocalist/rhythm guitarist Paul Draper, bassist Stove King, lead guitarist/backing vocalist Dominic Chad, and drummer Andie Rathbone.", "Paul Draper and Stove King met in the early 1990s, whilst working in the printing industry as photo retouchers for rival companies situated opposite each other on the same industrial park in Little Stanney on the outskirts of Chester. Through their shared love of David Bowie and 1980s new wave bands including Duran Duran and ABC they started socialising together at weekends, going to gigs in Liverpool and playing along to drum loops together in their bedrooms with the desire of forming a band together.Reid, Pat, Burning Ambition - Mansun's Stove, web.archive.org. Retrieved August 2011 Whilst King was a relative newcomer to playing bass, Draper had previously formed and fronted the electronic duo Grind whilst studying at Thames Polytechnic (now University of Greenwich), with programmer-keyboard player Steve Heaton, and were often accompanied live by school friend Carlton Hibbert on drums. Grind released one 12\" single in 1991 on the small \"Whats in It For Me Records\" label and gigged around London at venues such as The Rock Garden and The Brain and also supported Beverley Craven at the Mean Fiddler. Following the split of Grind, Draper, funded by a grant from The Prince's Trust, set up a music company called \"Ambiance Productions\" producing relaxation tapes to be sold in \"hippie shops\" across the north west of England. In early 1995 Draper and King enlisted Maidstone expat Dominic Chad, who was the bar manager at the Fat Cat pub on Watergate Street in Chester opposite the office where Draper would go and see former Grind member Steve Heaton. Chad had previously played with \"Floating Bear\" formed whilst at Bangor University in 1990, where he had been studying French and Russian but was kicked off the course due to lack of effort. Chad would later admit that his routine during university was \"get up at three, go down to the union bar at four and stay there until it shut\". With the aid of a drum machine, the trio began rehearsing at Crash Rehearsal Studios in Liverpool, where the band were quickly discovered by passing A&R scouts Mark Lewis and Alan Wills (who later went on to form Deltasonic Records) who were there to see Cast and overheard the band through their rehearsal room door. The band were offered a publishing contract with Polygram Music Publishing four days after reluctantly handing over a demo tape of 4 songs that cost \u00a3150 to record featuring \"Take It Easy Chicken\", \"Skin Up Pin Up\", \"Moronica\" and \"She Makes My Nose Bleed\".", "In March 2008, on the prospect of a Mansun reunion, Draper stated that whilst he and Andie Rathbone were interested, \"Dominic Chad would never do it, so it can't happen\". In 2010, Rathbone commented that it was a \"pity the three others couldn't stop dramatising the problems and get out again, as we'd be phenomenal\". In 2011 Rathbone again confirmed his and Draper's desire to reform the band, but added that a reunion would have to include all four band members and that neither King nor Chad were interested.", "*Dominic Chad \u2013 guitars, backing vocals, keyboards (1995\u20132003)"]}, {"page": "Pageboy", "response": ["The pageboy was first popular in the 1900s with young boys as it was first popularized by child actors, such as John Tansey and, later, Jackie Coogan. The pageboy look on boys is often referred to as the Dutch Boy look after the popular fictional character. The pageboy returned to male fashion in the 1960s for grown men with straight hair after getting popularized by British rock bands such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. This was copied by many of the U.S. Garage Rock/Punk bands, including The Chocolate Watchband, ? and the Mysterians, and the Count Five. Andy Warhol and some members of The Velvet Underground also sported the androgynous haircut. The early Ramones haircuts were elongated pageboys, also sported, though less long, by the male members of Blondie.  In the 1980s, the haircut became a symbol of Garage Punk and UK Beat music as seen on the album Rockabilly Psychosis and the Garage Disease and worn by bands with '60s influences the Barracudas and Primal Scream. Mansun lead guitarist, Dominic Chad, was known for sporting this haircut in the late nineties."]}, {"page": "Little Kix", "response": ["* Dominic Chad \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals, piano"]}, {"page": "Six (Mansun album)", "response": ["The album's sleeve art was a painting produced by Max Schindler, and commissioned especially for the album.
