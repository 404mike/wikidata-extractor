After working at Butlins' Holiday Camp in Clacton, he joined a group called 'The Cutaways' and they became 'Tony Rivers and the Castaways'. They recorded six singles for EMI between 1963 and 1966, but did not have a hit. In 1968 the band disbanded and Rivers formed Harmony Grass with former band mates. Their single \"Move in a Little Closer\" reached No. 24 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1969. They released one album, This Is Us, on RCA, and gave concerts in the UK (including at London's Marquee Club). Rivers left to go solo in 1970.\nRivers started to do session work and performed many cover versions on the Top of the Pops records. He sang and arranged with/for Cliff Richard throughout the 1970s up to the late 1980s, going on world tours and assisting with the production of recordings for Richard during that period, including arranging the harmonies and singing backing vocals on hits such as \"Miss You Nights\" and \"Devil Woman\". Rivers also worked on recordings and hits for musicians as diverse as Steve Harley, Shakin' Stevens, Sheena Easton, Soft Machine, UFO, Pink Floyd (The Final Cut), The Who and others.

However, he also notes that \"there was good and there was bad\", and that the studio singers and musicians usually tried their best. Dave Thompson for AllMusic stated that \"it becomes apparent that the trick is not to look upon the songs as straightforward attempts to copy the hit song, but as interpretations rendered in the style of the hit\".
