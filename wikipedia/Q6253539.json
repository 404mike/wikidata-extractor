He established himself in the first team in January 1925 and played regularly for the club over the next nine years. He scored seven goals in 22 league appearances in the 1929\u201330 season, which ended with the club being crowned as Third Division South champions. Pullen earned one senior cap for Wales, playing alongside club team-mate Moses Russell against England on 1 March 1926.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Pullen", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Pullen"]}, {"page": "History of the Wales national football team (1876\u20131976)", "response": ["Squad withdrawals continued to be a problem for the Welsh side. When Wales were left short for the visit of Scotland in the 1925\u201326 Championship, Ted Robbins called up debutant Jack Lewis after following him to a train station in Newport where he was due to travel to Birmingham to play for Cardiff City. Defeats to Scotland and Ireland followed and Robbins was again forced to make a late addition for the final match against England: John Pullen had been travelling to London with Moses Russell and was persuaded to join up to win his first cap, alongside Charlie Jones. Wales went on to win the match 3\u20131. Wales recorded a third championship win of the decade during the 1927\u201328 tournament, despite starting the competition poorly: they conceded two goals in the first half against Scotland before Ernie Curtis and an own goal by Jimmy Gibson salvaged a point. Wales defeated England 2\u20131 before travelling to Belfast to play Ireland in the final match. The game was tied at 1\u20131 until Wilf Lewis secured the win for Wales by charging both the ball and opposition goalkeeper into the net. When Ireland defeated Scotland two weeks later, Wales were officially confirmed as winners."]}, {"page": "Pullen, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Pullen"]}]}}
