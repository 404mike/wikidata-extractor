In 2009 he played on the third-tier Alps Tour and finished 23rd on the Order of Merit, with six top-ten finishes. He made several appearances on the second-tier Challenge Tour in 2010, and performed well enough to finish 82nd on the final standings and gain full status for 2011. In October 2011, he won for the first time on the Challenge Tour at the Fred Olsen Challenge de Espa\u00f1a. This sealed his promotion to the main European Tour for 2012. He played well enough in his first full season to retain his playing rights, finishing 72nd on the Order of Merit.\nBaldwin is from Southport, Lancashire - the same home town as fellow professional golfer Tommy Fleetwood. His grandfather is the former professional rugby league footballer Ron Ryder.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steelton, Pennsylvania", "response": ["After initial habitation by Susquehannock Indians and subsequent nearby Harrisburg establishment, the area was owned by the Kelker family of Harrisburg by the 1800s. The 100-acre area was chosen in 1866 by Samuel Morse Felton Sr., president of the Pennsylvania Steel Company, to begin construction of a steel mill. This particular site was favored because of the location's proximity to the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Pennsylvania Canal, and the nearby iron mine in Cornwall, Lebanon County. The land was purchased from owners Henry A. and Rudolph F. Kelker; then, steel pioneer Alexander Lyman Holley was chosen to build the mill along the Susquehanna River, which was completed by 1867 (along with a mansion for Felton), and began operation on May 15, 1868. Originally named \"Baldwin\" after Matthew Baldwin, founder of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, by 1871 it had changed to \"Steel Works\" after the existence of another Baldwin, Pennsylvania Post Office, and finally \"Steelton\" in 1879 after confusion of the Post Office with the steel mill itself. It was incorporated as a borough on January 19, 1880. The extensive steel works of the Pennsylvania Steel Company later became operated by Bethlehem Steel, ArcelorMittal, and currently Cleveland-Cliffs. Also present at one time were brickyards, a flouring mill, and machine shops."]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["*2004 Matthew Baldwin, Gary Boyd, Jordan Findlay, Zac Gould, Scott Henry, Cian McNamara, Aaron O'Callaghan, Paul O'Hara, John Parry"]}, {"page": "Challenge de Espa\u00f1a", "response": ["| 2011 ||  Matthew Baldwin || align=center|263 || align=center|\u221221 || Playoff ||  Julien Guerrier || Tecina Golf"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Matthew Baldwin||1986\u2013"]}, {"page": "Julien Guerrier", "response": ["| Matthew Baldwin"]}, {"page": "2011 Challenge Tour", "response": ["| Matthew Baldwin (1)"]}, {"page": "2011 Challenge Tour graduates", "response": ["|align=left| Matthew Baldwin*  || 10 || 76,972 || 26 || 16 ||  || 72 || 372,786"]}, {"page": "2012 U.S. Open (golf)", "response": ["*England: Matthew Baldwin, Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy, George Coetzee, Mikko Ilonen, Rapha\u00ebl Jacquelin, S\u00f8ren Kjeldsen, Peter Lawrie, Matteo Manassero, Alex Nor\u00e9n, Lee Slattery, Marc Warren"]}, {"page": "2012 Open Championship", "response": [":Europe: Matthew Baldwin, Alejandro Ca\u00f1izares, Jamie Donaldson, Richard Finch, Ross Fisher, Marcus Fraser, James Morrison, Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen, Lee Slattery, Sam Walker", "A further 12 players were appearing in their first Open Championship: Matthew Baldwin, Keegan Bradley, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Justin Hicks, Troy Kelly, Troy Matteson, James Morrison, Scott Pinckney, Chez Reavie, Michael Thompson, Johnson Wagner, and Sam Walker."]}, {"page": "Nelson Mandela Championship", "response": ["| 2013 || EUR, AFR ||  Dawie van der Walt || align=center|195 || align=center|\u221215 || 2 strokes  ||  Matthew Baldwin Jorge Campillo || Mount Edgecombe"]}, {"page": "Dawie van der Walt", "response": ["| Matthew Baldwin,  Jorge Campillo", "| Matthew Baldwin,  Jorge Campillo"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Open (golf)", "response": ["A reformat took place in 2019 and the event's name was changed to the ISPS Handa World Invitational and involved separate men's and women's events, both having the same prize money.
