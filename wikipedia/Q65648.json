It was to contain an audience of 2,100 and an orchestra of 250.  To raise money for its building, shares were issued and members of Liverpool society were invited to buy seats in the boxes to be included in the hall.  The foundation stone was laid in 1846 and construction began the following year.  In 1847 the society invited Felix Mendelssohn to compose a cantata based on words from Milton's Comus to celebrate the opening of the hall.  Mendelssohn died before this could be carried out. The hall cost \u00a330,000 (\u00a3 as of ) and was formally opened on 27 August 1849.  The first concert was performed by an orchestra of 96 and a choir of over 200; performers at the concert included three future conductors of the orchestra, Alfred Mellon, Julius Benedict and Charles Hall\u00e9.  The organist was W.\u00a0T.\u00a0Best. The hall was not full for the first performance; this was attributed to two factors, the high price of admission, and the fear that the building, without central supporting pillars, was unsafe.", "Problems soon arose.  In 1850 the choir formed the Liverpool Philharmonic Auxiliary Society and were in conflict with their conductor.  Herrmann offered his resignation, which was not accepted.  By 1852 the financial problems of the society were deteriorating.  Membership was exclusive and not all the seats on offer had been taken up.  Suggestions that the conditions for membership should be relaxed were refused. In 1852 the society widened its activities from music by arranging theatrical performances, including Charles Dickens' company and an appearance by William Makepeace Thackeray. In 1855 it was discovered that William Sudlow, the Honorary Secretary had been stealing money from the society; an amount of more than \u00a32,424 (\u00a3 as of ) had been embezzled.  Sudlow resigned from the society.  He was replaced by a paid secretary; the post was given to Henry Sudlow, a distant relative of William.  Henry was to serve the society for some 30\u00a0years with no similar problem. Prominent performers appearing for the society in 1856 were Jenny Lind, Clara Schumann and Charles Hall\u00e9. Dickens returned in 1858 and during that year the society was able to pay off the mortgage on the hall.", "By 1865 Hermann's health was deteriorating and a new principal conductor, Alfred Mellon, was appointed in September.  Mellon died only 18\u00a0months later, and was replaced by Julius Benedict, who remained in post until 1880, when his eyesight was deteriorating.  While Benedict was principal conductor, the society flourished both artistically and financially. This did not continue during the tenure of the next principal conductor, despite his later fame. Max Bruch was appointed on 23 February 1880 and served for less than three years.  During this time he experienced conflict with the committee of the society and complained about the behaviour of the audience.  He resigned in January 1883 at which time the standards of the orchestra and the choir had deteriorated, and members of the committee were disagreeing with each other. The person appointed to sort this out was Charles Hall\u00e9 who had by this time established the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester.  Hall\u00e9 continued as principal conductor until his death in 1895.  During this time the orchestra and choir flourished.  Those who appeared with the society during this time included Paderewski, Hubert Parry, Nellie Melba, and Clara Butt.
