Fisher, the man who created the Miami Beach, Florida resort, for whom he designed a number of golf courses in Florida and Long Island. He was one of the most successful British amateur golfers of the 1920s and 1930s and later served as secretary at several prestigious UK golf clubs.

Contrary to some newspaper reports, young Shand was not abandoned by his mother and stepfather but was taken to live with them in Westbury, Long Island, New York, in 1921, a passage of his life that he omitted from his autobiography, giving the erroneous impression of having been abandoned."]}, {"page": "List of golf course architects", "response": ["*Herbert Charles Tippet"]}]}}
