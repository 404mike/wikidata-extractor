According to the EastEnders Handbook, parents of young child actors were sometimes upset unavoidably during filming of EastEnders. For instance, the parents of the baby who played Hassan Osman were affected when their baby was used in a storyline about cot death, as they had not been warned. This problem was avoided with the two-year-old girl who played Carmel's niece, Aisha Roberts, as she was the real-life daughter of actress Judith Jacob. The writers \"obligingly\" called the young character Aisha, to make it less confusing for the actors. The idea to use Jacob's real daughter had come from the serial's co-creator Julia Smith. Jacob was initially against the idea. In an interview she commented, \"Children on the set can be so horrible\", due to awkwardness inherent in disciplining someone else\u2019s child in the workplace. However, she has said that she found it hard to turn Julia Smith down, and realised that she would get to spend more time with her daughter if she also was working on the set of EastEnders.

Despite the inconsistency, the producers left the scene in.", "Conversely, in The Black and White Media Show Book, edited by John Twitchin of BBC TV's Continuing Education Department (published in 1988), EastEnders is praised for portraying black people on mainstream television, and for giving them \"respectable, fleshed-out parts which allow them to be the most difficult of things \u2014 'normal people'.\" Additionally, actress Judith Jacob has said that she looks back on her three years in EastEnders only with \"delight\". She has also said that she disagrees with the criticism EastEnders gets for paying \"token lip service to blacks and minorities, who are usually depicted stereotypically.\" In 2006, she commented to the Walford Gazette, \"EastEnders was the only show to [regularly employ] black actors.
