While at the University of St Andrews she led the team which discovered a protoplanet within the protoplanetary disk around the young star HL Tauri.In 2017, she was awarded the Fred Hoyle Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics for her \"significant contribution to our understanding of planet formation and exoplanet habitability through her seminal imaging of debris discs around Sun-like stars and solar system bodies using far-infrared telescopes\".In 2018, she announced preliminary results from studies of the presence of phosphorus in supernova remnants, indicating that the level of phosphorus in the Crab Nebula is much lower than in Cassiopeia A, leading to speculations that a paucity of phosphorus might limit the formation of alien life.On September 14th 2020, her team announced the discovery of phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tau Ceti", "response": ["In 2004, a team of UK astronomers led by Jane Greaves discovered that Tau Ceti has more than ten times the amount of cometary and asteroidal material orbiting it than does the Sun. This was determined by measuring the disk of cold dust orbiting the star produced by collisions between such small bodies. This result puts a damper on the possibility of complex life in the system, because any planets would suffer from large impact events roughly ten times more frequently than Earth. Greaves noted at the time of her research that \"it is likely that [any planets] will experience constant bombardment from asteroids of the kind believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs\". Such bombardments would inhibit the development of biodiversity between impacts. However, it is possible that a large Jupiter-sized gas giant (such as the proposed planet \"i\") could deflect comets and asteroids."]}, {"page": "Venus", "response": ["In September 2020, a team of astronomers led by Jane Greaves from Cardiff University announced the likely detection of phosphine, a gas not known to be produced by any known chemical processes on the Venusian surface or atmosphere, in the upper levels of the planet's clouds. One proposed source for this phosphine is living organisms. The phosphine was detected at heights of at least 30 miles above the surface, and primarily at mid-latitudes with none detected at the poles. The discovery prompted NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine to publicly call for a new focus on the study of Venus, describing the phosphine find as \"the most significant development yet in building the case for life off Earth\"."]}, {"page": "Greaves (surname)", "response": ["*Jane Greaves, British astronomy"]}, {"page": "Fred Hoyle Medal and Prize", "response": ["*2017: Jane Greaves, for planet formation and exoplanet habitability"]}, {"page": "Nature's 10", "response": ["# Jane Greaves, Cardiff University, UK"]}, {"page": "Anna Scaife", "response": ["Scaife was part of a team of astrophysicists, including Jane Greaves, who identified nanodiamonds in three infant star systems, V892 Tau, HD 97048 and MWC 297 in the Milky Way.
