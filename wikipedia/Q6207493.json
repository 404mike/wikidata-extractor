He scored two tries for Scotland.\nRichard Bath writes of him that:\n\n\"Although he was at his height a decade before John Rutherford appeared on the scene, Gala's Jock Turner shared many similarities with the Selkirk legend, not least the Borders school of hard knocks in which they plied their trade on a domestic level. A regular with the great Gala sevens of the 1960s, Turner had a huge boot on him, but was equally at home running at opposition defences, as he did to such effect in Scotland's 14-3 loss to the touring All Blacks in 1967.\"He was selected for the 1968 British Lions tour to South Africa and played in all four internationals against South Africa.\nIn 1971, he helped Scotland win their first victory at Twickenham for 33 years.He played club rugby for Gala.Allan Massie writes of him that:\n\n\"His best season for Scotland may have been his last when he played fly-half partnered by bis clubmate Duncan Paterson, but his best position was probably centre...\"Turner was always inclined to be underrated, and he was neither spectacular nor readily recognizable as his contemporaries Rea or Frame. But he was sounder than either, an utterly reliable handler and a magnificent tackler, and a much better kicker. His virtues were indeed only beginning to be recognized when he retired... one touchline try against England at Twickenham was scored in the narrowest imaginable space. He scored another try against England the next year with a clean breakthrough after a scissors with Ian Robertson.\"He died suddenly after a days fishing with the legendary Welsh rugby player Gareth Edwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gala RFC", "response": ["*  Jock Turner", "*  Jock Turner"]}, {"page": "Allan Massie", "response": ["* Jock Turner, David Chisholm, Alex Hastie, David Rollo, Norman Bruce, Iain Paxton"]}, {"page": "1968 British Lions tour to South Africa", "response": ["*Jock Turner (Gala and Scotland)"]}, {"page": "Jock (given name)", "response": ["* John Jock Turner (born 1943), Scottish former rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Rugby union in the Scottish Borders", "response": ["* Jock Turner"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union players", "response": ["|734||TurnerJock Turner||fly-half||1966-02-05||v Wales at Cardiff"]}, {"page": "1967 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, France and Canada", "response": ["Scotland: 15.
