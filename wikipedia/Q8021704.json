The club had a fruitful relationship with Celtic who loaned out many youth prospects and picked up the occasional player themselves. As well as the three aforementioned players from Hibernians' Junior Cup winning side, Celtic also signed Charlie Napier and Peter Scarff the following year with the latter winning one cap for the full Scotland team. In the Harp era, players exchanged between the two clubs included Hugh Long, Willie Miller, Duncan MacKay, Bertie Auld, Frank Haffey and Jimmy Quinn with all but Quinn becoming full Scotland internationalists."]}]}}
