He signed for Hibs in 1954, and made his first team debut the same year, having been converted to the centre forward position. In 1955, he became the first player to score a goal on British soil in the first season of the European Cup, scoring the opening goal of a 1\u20131 draw in a first round tie between Hibs and Rot-Weiss Essen. Despite being a prolific goalscorer for Hibs' reserve team, Buchanan found difficulty in winning a place in the first team, as the club enjoyed the services of internationals Lawrie Reilly and Joe Baker. His time at Hibs was also interrupted by two years of National Service, which Buchanan spent with the Royal Artillery in Oswestry.Buchanan's last first team appearance for Hibs was in a 2\u20131 defeat against Rangers at Ibrox in December 1960. He was then transferred to Raith Rovers, who he played for in the rest of the 1960\u201361 season. After a season in English football with Newport County, Buchanan returned to Scotland to play for Gala Fairydean, Duns and Hawick Royal Albert. After retiring as a player, he moved back to his native Edinburgh and became a taxi driver.Buchanan died in September 2009 after suffering a long illness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Buchanan", "response": ["John Buchanan may refer to:", "*John Buchanan (oil executive) (1943\u20132015), New Zealand-born scientist and director", "*John Buchanan (Canadian politician) (1931-2019), Premier of Nova Scotia, 1978\u20131990.", "*John Buchanan (American politician), American journalist and U.S. presidential candidate, 2004", "*John Buchanan (Maryland judge) (1772\u20131844), Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals", "*John Buchanan (MP) (1761\u20131839), Scottish politician, MP for Dunbartonshire 1821\u201326", "*John Buchanan (New Zealand politician) (1819\u20131892), New Zealand politician", "*John Buchanan (pastor), pastor of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago", "*John Buchanan (bishop), American bishop of the Episcopal Church", "*John Buchanan (biologist) (1917\u20132007), professor of biochemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "*John Buchanan (botanist) (1819\u20131898), New Zealand botanist and scientific artist", "*John Buchanan (English cricketer) (1887\u20131969), English cricketer and decorated WWI officer", "*John Buchanan (Australian cricketer) (born 1953), Australian cricketer and coach", "*John Buchanan (Cambuslang footballer) (fl. 1889), Scottish footballer", "*John Buchanan (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u20131947), Scottish footballer (St Mirren, Rangers, Morton)", "*John Buchanan (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20132000), Scottish footballer (Clyde)", "*John Buchanan (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u20132009), Scottish footballer (Hibernian)", "*John Buchanan (footballer, born 1951), Scottish footballer (Cardiff City, Northampton Town)", "*John Buchanan (sailor) (1884\u20131943), British Olympic gold medalist in 1908", "*John Buchanan (soccer), former Canadian soccer coach, in Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame", "*John Buchanan (inventor), Australian inventor of the atmospheric diving suit", "*John Buchanan (judoka) (born 1975), British judoka", "*John Buchanan (settler) (1855\u20131896), Scottish agriculturalist and early colonial settler in Nyasland"]}, {"page": "Buchanan (surname)", "response": ["* John Buchanan (botanist) (1819\u20131898), Scottish-born botanist active in New Zealand", "* \"Major\" John Buchanan (1759\u20131832), American frontiersman, founder of present-day Nashville, Tennessee", "* John Buchanan (Canadian politician) (1931-2019), Canadian politician", "* John Buchanan (American politician), Republican presidential candidate in 2004", "* John Buchanan (sailor) (1884\u20131943), Scottish Olympic medalist in sailing", "* John Buchanan (footballer, born 1935) (died 2009), Scottish footballer", "* John Buchanan (footballer, born 1951), Scottish footballer "]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 in Scottish football", "response": ["* 1 September \u2013 John Buchanan, 74, Hibs and Raith Rovers forward."]}, {"page": "John Buchanan (footballer born 1935)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Buchanan (footballer, born 1935)"]}, {"page": "Jock Buchanan (footballer, born 1935)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Buchanan (footballer, born 1935)"]}]}}
