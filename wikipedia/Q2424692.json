He was described as the greatest lawyer of his generation. Baroness Hale of Richmond observed that his pioneering role in the formation of the United Kingdom Supreme Court may be his most important and long-lasting legacy. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers regarded Bingham as \"one of the two great legal figures of my lifetime in the law\". Lord Hope remembered Bingham as \"the greatest jurist of our time\".After retiring from the judiciary in 2008, Bingham focused on teaching and lecturing in human rights law. His book, The Rule of Law, was published in 2010 and posthumously won the 2011 Orwell Prize for Literature. The British Institute of International and Comparative Law named the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law in his honour.", "link_mentions": []}}
