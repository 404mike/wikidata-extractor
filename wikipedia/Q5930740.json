Believing that there was a base for his politics in the west of Scotland, he stood for the Motherwell constituency in several Parliamentary elections.\nIn the 1918 general election, Ferguson won only 10.7% of the vote.  However, in the 1922 election, there was no official Unionist candidate, and standing as an \"Independent Unionist\", Ferguson came a close second with 29.1%.  By the 1923 election, he was able to secure his adoption as the official Unionist candidate, and narrowly took the seat.  However, he held it for only a year, losing by an equally slim margin.\nFerguson then faded from public view.  In 1933, he was convicted of receiving stolen goods, namely iron plates and railway chairs. He died on 4 November 1937.", "link_mentions": {}}}
