Bridging condensed matter theory and quantum optics he specialises in quantum nanophotonics, plasmonics, metamaterials and semiconductor laser dynamics. Since the late 1980s he has been an author and coauthor of over 300 peer-reviewed articles, the most popular of which, called \"'Trapped rainbow' storage of light in metamaterials\", was cited more than 400 times. He pioneered active (gain enhanced) nanoplasmonics and metamaterials with quantum gain and in 2014 he introduced the \"stopped-light lasing\" principle as a novel route to cavity-free (nano-) lasing and localisation of amplified surface plasmon polaritons,  giving him an h-index of 33.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hess (surname)", "response": ["*Ortwin Hess, British optician and physicist"]}, {"page": "Ortwin (name)", "response": ["*Ortwin Hess (born 1966), German theoretical physicist "]}]}}
