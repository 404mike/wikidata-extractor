At the end of the season, both Dougall and Wilson had left the club and Coates hardly missed a match in 1932\u201333 (making 30 appearances) until April, when Tom Ruddy replaced him. In a league match at Bradford City on 15 October 1932, Coates had to deputise in goal for Bert Scriven when he was injured.

In September 1930, he lost his place to Bert Scriven and although White regained his place in goal for the last eight matches of the season, Scriven claimed the No. 1 shirt on a permanent basis in September 1931."]}, {"page": "Eugene Bernard", "response": ["Bernard was born in Southampton and educated at Taunton's School. He joined Southampton as an amateur in November 1933, and made frequent reserve-team appearances. At the start of the 1936\u201337 season, both regular custodian Bert Scriven and new signing Len Stansbridge were unavailable, so Bernard was drafted into the first team for matches at home to Chesterfield (won 3\u20132) and away to Doncaster Rovers (lost 2\u20130), before Scriven's return."]}, {"page": "George Thompson (footballer, born 1900)", "response": ["In the summer of 1930, with Bert Scriven now promoted to second-choice 'keeper behind White, Thompson was placed on the transfer list for a fee of \u00a3250.

The outbreak of the Second World War necessitated the abandonment of the 1939\u201340 season after three matches, signalling the end of Warhurst's professional career. However, he continued to play for Southampton in the Wartime Leagues. During the war, he also played on occasions for the Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft works team based at Eastleigh.

Due to ongoing injury problems for his side's regular centre-forward Haines, in February 1929 Chadwick brought in former Royal Air Force aircraftsman Douglas Vernon to help with the end of season run-in.

In the replay at The Dell four days later, the top-flight visitors quickly asserted their dominance in the first half with three goals against the \"sluggish\" hosts.
