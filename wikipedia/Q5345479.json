The assassin used a Browning 9\u00a0mm semi-automatic pistol, shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times. John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds. Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal. When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation. One of the few people allowed in to see him at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery.What really happened between Pope John Paul II and his close friend, Anna-Teresa Tymienecka? by Edward Stourton, 15 February 2016, The Telegraph The pope later stated that the Blessed Virgin Mary helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal."]}, {"page": "Today (BBC Radio 4)", "response": ["After Brian Redhead died in January 1994, James Naughtie became a member of the team.
