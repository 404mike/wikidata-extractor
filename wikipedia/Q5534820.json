He followed with other essays and letters about philosophy and freedom in academia, some of which were published in another campus magazine called The Bug. He served as the Herald editor during the 1951\u201352 school year. He wrote his first short story that year, \"In a Village Church\" (1951), an amusing look at the Igbo synthesis between life in rural Nigeria with Christian institutions and icons.

In 1939 he taught as a research lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford. During this period, he read the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, and the Sufi poet of Iran Rumi, as well as studying the Hindu Upanishads. Zaehner came then to adopt a personal brand of \"nature mysticism\". Yet his spiritual progression led him a few years later to convert to Christianity, becoming a Roman Catholic while stationed in Iran.Geoffrey Parrinder, \"Robert Charles Zaehner (1913\u20131974)\" in History of Religion 16: 66\u201374, 74 (1976).", "In part, about nature mysticism, Zaehner relies on William James,Zaehner, Mysticism.

The Hindu aphorism Tat Tvam Asi or thou art that, in referring the individual's unifying Self to the presence of the Deity, may describe the insight that completes the link. Cf., p.118.

Islamic scholars like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi consider it as the physical death of Jesus, and hence question the return of Jesus.

He was also impressed by the freedom of speech available in the country, especially at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park. The family moved into the curate's flat behind the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, where Tutu assisted Sunday services, the first time that he had ministered to a white congregation. It was in the flat that a daughter, Mpho Andrea Tutu, was born in 1963. Tutu was academically successful and his tutors suggested that he convert to an honours degree, which entailed his also studying Hebrew.
