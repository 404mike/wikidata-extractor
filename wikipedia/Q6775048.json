His research critically examined the context and character of the early fossil record, making use of field mapping, logging, optical petrography, stable isotope geochemistry, confocal microscopy, NanoSims microprobes, and lasers for high resolution 3D scanning and laser Raman spectroscopy.\nBrasier died in a car accident near Burford, Oxfordshire, UK, on 16 December 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 12", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Martin Brasier, English palaeontologist, biologist, and academic (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "December 16", "response": ["*2014 \u2013 Martin Brasier, English paleontologist, biologist, and academic (b. 1947)"]}, {"page": "Lyell Medal", "response": ["* 2014 Martin Brasier"]}, {"page": "Andrew Parker (zoologist)", "response": ["In his 2003 book In the Blink of an Eye, Parker proposes that the Cambrian Explosion, as the sudden diversification in animal fossil forms at the start of the Cambrian Period, was due to the development of the vision faculty and the consequent intensification of predation. He calls this the \"Light Switch Theory.\" In particular he concludes that predation with vision led to the development of hard body parts, explaining why the fossil record displayed the Cambrian Explosion at this point in time. The theory received varied reviews; while some were highly critical of the book and its central hypothesis,Simon Conway Morris (2003) On the First Day, God Said..., American Scientist July\u2013August 2003 the majority of others were highly positive.Gert Korthof (2003). \"The Cambrian explosion and eye evolution solved at one stroke\". 22 June 2003 However an important criticism remained that of timing, of the relationship between the rise of predation and the period when vision developed. In his review of many of the debates about the transformation of life forms around the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, Martin Brasier argues that predation played a critical role during the Cambrian Explosion, but that Parker's emphasis on vision is misplaced because eyes did not develop until late in the spread of such predation."]}, {"page": "Boring Billion", "response": ["In 1995, geologists Roger Buick, Davis Des Marais, and Andrew Knoll reviewed the apparent lack of major biological, geological, and climatic events during the Mesoproterozoic era 1.6 to 1 billion years ago (Gya), and, thus, described it as \"the dullest time in Earth's history\". The term \"Boring Billion\" was coined by paleontologist Martin Brasier to refer to the time between about 2 and 1 Gya, which was characterized by geochemical stasis and glacial stagnation. In 2013, geochemist Grant Young used the term \"Barren Billion\" to refer to a period of apparent glacial stagnation and lack of carbon isotope excursions from 1.8 to 0.8 Gya. In 2014, geologists Peter Cawood and Chris Hawkesworth called the time between 1.7 and 0.75 Gya \"Earth's Middle Ages\" due to a lack of evidence of tectonic movement."]}, {"page": "Brazier (name)", "response": ["*Martin Brasier (1947\u20132014), British biologist"]}, {"page": "J.

He suggested that the apparent cells were cyanobacteria, and therefore oxygen-producing photosynthesis, which lived about 3.3 billion to 3.5 billion years ago. This was the oldest known fossil at the time. However, Martin Brasier and his team from University of Oxford sought to discredit the fossils as \"secondary artefacts formed from amorphous graphite\" in 2002.
