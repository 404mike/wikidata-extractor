Up until the reforms of Vatican II, the priest performed his movements facing the altar rather than the congregation, who could not hear the words very well, nor understand the Latin, nor clearly see his movements. At one point the priest would say \"Hoc est corpus meum\" meaning \"This is My body\". That theory led Scottish politician Michael Matheson in 2008 to urge police action \"against individuals who use it [the song and dance] to taunt Catholics\". Matheson's claim was deemed ridiculous by fans from both sides of the Old Firm (the rival Glasgow football teams Celtic and Rangers) and calls were made on fans' forums for both sides to join together to sing the song on 27 December 2008 at Ibrox Stadium. Close relatives of Jimmy Kennedy and Al Tabor have publicly stated their recollections of the origin and meaning of the Hokey Cokey, and have denied its connection to the Mass.Letter to the editor, \"Hokey Cokey: no Catholic dig \u2013 Grandson of the writer defends song against claims that it is anti-Catholic, saying it is based on a phrase about ice cream\", The Times (London, UK) Those accounts differ, but they are all contradicted by the fact that the song existed and was published decades before its supposed composition in the 1940s."]}, {"page": "Shona Robison", "response": ["After the SNP's victory in the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, Robison was appointed as the Minister for Public Health.

Carillion's collapse and weather interruptions delayed overall completion of the project; in March 2018, Balfour Beatty said the project would open by the second half of the year, a date which then slipped to December 2018, partly due to problems involving concrete cladding panels at the crossing over the River Don. In December 2018, MSPs heard the final cost of the Aberdeen bypass would exceed \u00a31 billion while a  section of the route would open during the week starting from the 10th December. The majority of the bypass was now open to motorists with the completion of the Stonehaven Fast Link and Southern Leg by mid-December. However the final  section between Parkhill and Craibstone (which included the Don Crossing), was delayed until after Christmas 2018. With the final section still unopened in the New Year at the end of January 2019, Scottish transport secretary Michael Matheson demanded an urgent meeting with Balfour Beatty and Galliford Try bosses over the continuing delays. The final section opened on 19 February 2019, bringing the four year construction period to a close."]}]}}
