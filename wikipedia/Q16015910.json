Although he suffered from a case of appendicitis during the year, he scored 14 times in 23 matches, including hat-tricks against Doncaster Rovers and Fulham. In October 1953, having been plagued by knee problems, Dudley moved to the First Division for the first time in his career, joining Cardiff City in exchange for Bobby McLaughlin. He made his debut for the Bluebirds on 24 October 1953 during a 3\u20130 defeat to Burnley but made just four further appearances for the club, scoring once during a 5\u20130 victory over Charlton Athletic, as a persistent knee injury and the signing of Welsh international Trevor Ford saw him unable to break into the first-team. He left the club after just four months to sign for Brentford."]}, {"page": "Football League Third Division North versus South representative matches", "response": ["| Bobby McLaughlin"]}, {"page": "Robert McLaughlin", "response": ["* Bobby McLaughlin (1925\u20132003), Northern Irish footballer who played for Wrexham, Cardiff City and Southampton,"]}, {"page": "Sam Stevens (footballer)", "response": ["His first-team debut came in a Football League Third Division match at Chesterfield on 25 August 1958, when he played at left-half in a 3\u20133 draw.
