Both films were based on plays cowrittened by Ivor Novello, Graham Cutts, Constance Collier and Reginald Fogwell. Jeans also returned to reprise her role from the first film, as did Marie Ault and Julie Suedo. A notable absence is the character of Odile, a central figure in The Rat as played by Mae Marsh.  At the end of the previous film Pierre had seemingly rejected the lure of life in high society as represented by the Jeans character of Z\u00e9lie, and he and Odile had finally realised the depth of their love for each other. However The Triumph of the Rat finds him back with Z\u00e9lie, and not only does Odile not appear in the film, but not even a passing mention is made as to what might have happened in the interim to cause her to disappear so completely from Pierre's life.  This reportedly puzzled contemporary audiences, and while some later observers have theorised that The Triumph of the Rat is meant to present an alternative reality in which Pierre chose Z\u00e9lie over Odile at the end of the original film, there is no evidence that anything so sophisticated was ever the intention.", "* Marie Ault as M\u00e8re Colline"]}, {"page": "The Return of the Rat", "response": ["The Return of the Rat is the last of a trilogy of films starring Novello as Pierre Boucheron (The Rat) and Jeans as his sometime lover, sometime nemesis Z\u00e9lie.

The Triumph of the Rat closes with Pierre destitute and on the street, a situation brought about mainly by Z\u00e9lie's spite and vindictiveness, yet by the start of The Return of the Rat the couple are married.
