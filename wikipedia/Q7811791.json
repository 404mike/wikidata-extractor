With the help of friends Roger Nichols and Toby Foster, the band converted their barn into an artist-owned recording studio.  Bruce was particularly enthusiastic about the idea because he had always disliked the sterile vibe in the studios of the era.  The studio's first clients started with friends like Del Shannon, who brought Jeff Lynne from Electric Light Orchestra to the facility. As word spread about the facility other artists of note - Little Richard, Bob Crewe, Michael McDonald and others - came to the studio to record. Then, Nichols recorded Steely Dan\u2019s \u201cPretzel Logic,\u201d which resulted in the studio, now known as \u201cCherokee Ranch\u201d, earning their first gold record.
