The band now consists of Dan Searle on drums, Sam Carter on vocals, Alex Dean on bass, and Adam Christianson and Josh Middleton on guitars. They have been signed to Epitaph Records since 2013.\nStrongly influenced by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, the sound of their first three albums was coarse, chaotic, and rhythmically complex. In 2011, Architects went in a more melodic post-hardcore direction with The Here and Now, alienating some of their fanbase. The following year, they returned towards their original style with Daybreaker,  establishing a balance of melody and technical harshness while introducing more politicised lyrics. With the release of their sixth album Lost Forever // Lost Together in 2014, the band achieved lasting popularity and critical acclaim.\nSoon after the release of their seventh album, All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us, in 2016, guitarist and principal songwriter Tom Searle died after three years of living with skin cancer, making Dan Searle the only original band member. In September 2017, the band released the single \"Doomsday\", the last song he was working on before his death, and announced Middleton as their new lead guitarist. The single is featured on Holy Hell, their first album recorded without Tom Searle, which was released in November 2018. Their ninth studio album, For Those That Wish to Exist, was released on 26 February 2021, it also became their first chart-topper on the UK Albums Chart.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Angmering School", "response": ["* Sam Carter, Musician"]}, {"page": "The Peace and the Panic", "response": ["The album's theme is showing how the band has grown in the period following the release of Life's Not out to Get You. The album's songs were written by a combination of the band, Mike Green and Ben Barlow's brother Sebastian. Sam Carter of Architects, Laura Whiteside, and Ella, Evie, Finlay and Darcy Jones provide vocals to different tracks. Barlow said the main part of the album's artwork is about \"being on a tightrope between 'The Peace' and 'The Panic' \u2013 trying to find the balance between the good and the bad\". After two teasers, as well as a support slot for All Time Low, The Peace and the Panic was formally announced, and music videos were released for \"Where Do We Go When We Go\" and \"Happy Judgement Day\". Following performances at Slam Dunk Festival in the UK and Warped Tour in the US, music videos were released for \"Motion Sickness\" and \"In Bloom\". The Peace and the Panic was then released on 18 August through independent label Hopeless Records.", "\"Motion Sickness\" and \"Parachute\" were credited to Neck Deep, Green and Sebastian Barlow. \"Happy Judgement Day\", \"The Grand Delusion\", \"19 Seventy Sumthin'\" and \"Beautiful Madness\" were credited to Neck Deep and Green. \"In Bloom\", \"Heavy Lies\" and \"Where Do We Go When We Go\" were credited to Neck Deep and Barlow. \"Don't Wait\", \"Critical Mistake\", \"Wish You Were Here\" and \"Worth It\" were credited to Neck Deep. Sam Carter of Architects provides guest vocals on \"Don't Wait\". The intro vocals on \"Where Do We Go When We Go\" were performed by Ella, Evie, Finlay and Darcy Jones. Laura Whiteside provides the intro to \"Critical Mistake\".", "\"Don't Wait\", which was written by drummer Dani Washington, was viewed by Barlow a \"more of a political song\" than \"Happy Judgement Day\". The group initially turned down the idea of having guest musicians, \"but later we were sat in the studio and I had the brainwave of having Sam Carter. He really put his stamp on it.\" The majority of lyrics on \"Critical Mistake\" were written by bassist Fil Thorpe-Evans. Barlow originally sent him an acoustic version of the track with a \"driving chorus that we all liked\". His brother \"being the wizard that he is\" turned it into a full-band track with a Weezer feel to it, something that \"we definitely wanted to touch upon\". With assistance from Barlow, Thorpe-Evans wrote \"Wish You Were Here\" about a friend who had died following a car crash. Thorpe-Evans said he \"really struggled dealing with those things ...  even talking about it with family is really hard\". He did, however, find it easier to write about it in a song \"because you can say what you want to say properly and decide what matters most\". Thorpe-Evans wrote the music, as well as the verses, while Barlow wrote the chorus.", "* Sam Carter of Architects \u2013 guest vocals on \"Don't Wait\""]}]}}
