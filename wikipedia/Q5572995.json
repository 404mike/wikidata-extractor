Bristol became the first British University to offer Drama as a degree subject\u2014as distinct from English\u2014when the visionary Vice-Chancellor, Sir Philip Morris, appointed Wickham (then 26) as the first junior academic in Drama in 1947. As part of this department\u2014a team dubbed 'the four musketeers' by Wickham\u2014Rowell played a key part in defining how drama would be taught as a discipline.Martin White, The Independent:  They developed a distinctive conception of their subject now largely accepted: of drama as a 'laboratory' subject, involving practice as well as library study, and indeed by 1951 they had their own studio space\u2014a converted squash court.University of Bristol: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2007/5674.html In keeping with this ethos, Brandt did some acting and directed several television, radio and film as well as stage, productions; Rowell, in collaboration with Kenneth Mobbs of Bristol Opera House, adapted and revised W. S. Gilbert's farce Engaged (1877), converting it into a Comic Opera in 1962. The department can also lay claim to a piece of theatrical history; they hosted the premiere of Harold Pinter's first play, The Room, in May 1957, performed in that former squash court of a theatre, The Drama Studio."]}, {"page": "The Digby Conversion of Saint Paul", "response": ["Adams believed the play to have been written by an author from the East Midlands, to be performed at stations in a small village on 25 January, that being the Festival of the Conversion of St. Paul. And while A. M. Kinghorn has it that the play was performed in a fixed locality and was the responsibility, not of the town's guilds, but of the church; Glynne Wickham, citing the text's many apologies for its \"simpleness\", argued that the play, in its final form at any rate, belonged \"to a Guild of artisans who were willing to travel and to adapt their script and presentation to the environment offered by their sponsors and hosts in exchange for hospitality and a small fee\" and thus, while the Digby plays may have originated, like the so-called Macro plays \u2013 The Castle of Perseverance, Mankind, and Wisdom \u2013, in or near Bury St Edmunds in East Anglia,English Moral Interludes edited by Glynne Wickham, Everyman's Library, 1976 they were able to migrate to Chelmsford in the 16th century.The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre edited by Richard Beadle and Alan J. Fletcher, Cambridge University Press", "It was not until the 1970s that Glynne Wickham, first in an essay and then in his edition of the play, challenged this conception, arguing that the three stations had taken the form either of mobile \"pageants\" or fixed \"mansions\" grouped together on a single acting area, or \"platea\". As William Tydeman points out, much hinges on how one interprets \"processyon\" in line 157 \u2013 as referring to a physical procession, or to the procession of the stage action.The Theatre in the Middle Ages: Western European Stage Conditions, c. 800\u20131576 by William Tydeman, Cambridge University Press, 1979  As this line is part of a passage marked \"si placet\" (i.e. optional) in the text, Wickham believes it hardly likely to have been a direction to the audience, and that it should be interpreted, along with \"proces\" in line 9 and 14, as signifying the thrust of an argument, and not physical movement. In his edition of 1993, Coldewey takes up a revisionist stance, believing that the play was processional in nature and clearly unconvinced by Wickham's argument."]}, {"page": "Pageant wagon", "response": ["In opposition to these descriptions, Glynne Wickham argues in The Early English Stages, that the wagon was only a one level structure taken up entirely by off stage space used for a dressing room.

The text is written in vernacular English, in an East Midlands dialect that suggests either Lincoln or Beverley as its origin, although its title is given in Latin.Wickham (1976, 193). The name of its playwright is unknown. Only two scenes, with a total of 84 lines of verse in rhyming couplets, are extant and survive in a manuscript held by the British Museum, dated to either the late twelfth or very early thirteenth century.British Museum Additional MS 23986; see Wickham (1976, 193). In the nineteenth century, the manuscript belonged to the Rev. Richard Yerburgh of Sleaford, father of the conservative politician Robert Armstrong Yerburgh; see Chambers (1903, 324). Glynne Wickham provides both the original text and a rendering in modern English in his English Moral Interludes (1976).Wickham (1976, 195\u2013203). E. K. Chambers also provided the text in his The Mediaeval Stage (1903, vol. 2, 324\u2013326), though Wickham points out that in that book the scenes have been inaccurately transcribed; see Wickham (1979, 198). Chamber's book is . In tone and form, the interlude seems to be the closest play in English to the contemporaneous French farces, such as The Boy and the Blind Man, and is related to later English farcical plays, such as the anonymous Calisto and Melibea (published c. 1525) and John Heywood's The Foure PP (c. 1530).Axton (1979, 15), Bevington (1962, 9; 11; 38; 45), Meredith (1998, 699), and Wickham (1981, 190). Calisto and Melibea is an adaptation of La Celestina; see Axton (1979, 69\u201396). It was most likely performed by itinerant players, possibly making use of a performing dog.Richardson and Johnston (1991, 54\u201355). In Early English Stages (1981), Wickham points to the existence of this play as evidence that the old-fashioned view that comedy began in England with Gammer Gurton's Needle and Ralph Roister Doister in the 1550s is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of medieval comic drama.Wickham (1981, 178). He argues that the play's \"command of dramatic action and of comic mood and method is so deft as to make it well-nigh unbelievable\" that it was the first of its kind in England.Wickham (1981, 190).
