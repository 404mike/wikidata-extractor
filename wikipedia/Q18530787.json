The genus name, Pelecanoides, means \"Pelican-resembling\", which was assigned to the diving-petrels on account of their expandable throat pouches that they use to carry food. Its specific name, urinatrix, is derived from the Latin term, urinator, which means \"diver\". Its subspecies' names include chathamensis, referring to the Chatham Islands, exsul, meaning \"isolated\" or \"remote\", dacunhae, referring to the Tristan da Cunha Islands, berard, honoring French navigator Auguste B\u00e9rard, and coppingeri, which honors Royal Navy surgeon and naturalist Richard William Coppinger."]}, {"page": "Coppinger", "response": ["*Richard William Coppinger (1847\u20131910), British naval surgeon and naturalist"]}, {"page": "European and American voyages of scientific exploration", "response": ["** Physician-naturalist: Richard William Coppinger (1847\u20131910) and Edward Lawton Moss"]}]}}
