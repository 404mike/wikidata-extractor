A relative latecomer to the sport, Cowan did not play football until he was 17 and was 22 by the time he turned professional. He made his league debut for Doncaster Rovers in 1923, and signed for First Division Manchester City the following season.\nCowan played centre half for Manchester City for 11 seasons, captaining the team in the early to mid-1930s. He is the only player to have represented Manchester City in three FA Cup finals, as a runner-up in 1926 and 1933, and as a winner in 1934. Internationally, he gained three England caps between 1926 and 1931. In total he played 407 times for Manchester City, putting him 12th in terms of all-time appearances. In 1935, he transferred to Bradford City, and subsequently moved to Mossley as player-manager.\nIn 1938, Cowan joined Brighton & Hove Albion as a coach, and set up a physiotherapy business. He returned to Manchester City as manager in 1946, winning the Second Division in his only season in charge. He continued to work in sports and physiotherapy until his death in 1964.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester City F.C.", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Sam Cowan               || DF (centre half)"]}, {"page": "Maine Road", "response": ["In 1934, the second highest attendance at an English football game at a club ground was recorded at Maine Road.  The first was the 1913 FA Cup Final, hosted by Crystal Palace with a crowd of 121,919.  The Maine Road match was between Manchester City and Stoke City in front of 84,569 fans in the sixth round of the FA Cup on 3 March 1934. Queues formed four hours before the match, and one journalist stated that Maine Road was packed two hours before kick-off. A decision was taken to close the turnstiles with an attendance at approximately 85,000, 3000 short of what was thought to be the maximum capacity. Supporters witnessed a visiting Stoke team which included Stanley Matthews and City's team boasted players Frank Swift, Fred Tilson, Sam Cowan and Matt Busby. The match was won 1\u20130 by Manchester City. This is the record home attendance for a domestic match and the record home attendance at a club ground, as the 1913 FA Cup final is not considered a home match for either team."]}, {"page": "Joe Fagan", "response": ["When league football resumed after the war, Fagan hoped to establish himself as a regular member of the Manchester City side. The team were then in the Football League Second Division. Managed by Wilf Wild, City were promotion favourites, especially as they included notable pre-war players like captain Sam Barkas, goalkeeper Frank Swift and inside forward Alex Herd. They got off to a winning start but in November there was a change of manager and Sam Cowan, City's pre-war captain, took over. Cowan was an innovator keen to make changes and one of these, on 1 January 1947 against Fulham at Maine Road, was to give Joe Fagan his official Manchester City debut more than eight years after he had joined the club. Fagan was then 25 and he played at right-half, making a creditable performance as City won 4\u20130.Fagan & Platt, p. 18. He played a key role in City's 1946\u201347 Second Division Championship-winning team and went on to make 121 consecutive league appearances from debut until November 1949.Matthews, p. 60. Tony Matthews recorded views of Fagan's \"solid worth\" to City in terms of his \"positional judgment, strong headwork (sic) and general reliability\"."]}, {"page": "Jimmy McMullan", "response": ["McMullan made his debut for his new team in a 1\u20131 draw with Liverpool on 27 February 1926. Tommy Browell scored the goal for City in that game. Despite containing a number of England players such as Frank Roberts, Billy Austin, Sam Cowan and Tommy Johnson, City finished in twenty-first place in the First Division that season and were relegated into the second division. McMullan played in the 1926 FA Cup Final defeat to Bolton Wanderers. McMullan scored his first goal for Manchester City in a 3\u20134 defeat to Southampton in the 1926\u201327 football season. City came third in the second division and were unable to earn promotion. In the 1927\u201328 football season McMullan helped City into first place in the second division, earning the team promotion. The team had been strengthened by the acquisition of both Eric Brook and Fred Tilson from Barnsley. ", "McMullan is regarded as one of Manchester City's best ever players. In 1977, Manchester City Council named eleven streets in a new estate in Moss Side after famous City players including McMullan, Frank Swift, Fred Tilson, Sam Cowan, Horace Barnes, Max Woosnam, Tommy Browell, Eric Brook, Sam Cookson, Billy Meredith and Tommy Johnson. p75"]}]}}
