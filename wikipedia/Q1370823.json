Kevin O'Keefe and Mathew Rodriguez noted that America's Next Top Model served as \"the biggest inspiration\" for the show and that season 1 of RuPaul's Drag Race was \"a parody of a couple different reality shows ... but more so (of) America's Next Top Model\". They explain that \"Top Model was a groundbreaking reality show\" and that \"it crawled so that Drag Race could walk\". They drew parallels between Tyra Banks and RuPaul as black people \"who (have) been at the top of their field\" and \"play a persona\" on their respective shows. They also compared the judging panels, comparing Michelle Visage to Nigel Barker as an \"anchor main judge\" who is \"harsher in their critiques\", although contrasted RuPaul's judges with Tyra's, stating that \"RuPaul has never allowed a drag queen to sit on the panel the way Tyra would bring in either Janice Dickinson then Twiggy.\" Moreover, the \"first mini challenge of the first several seasons of Drag Race used to always be a photoshoot\" and season 6's photoshoot of jumping off a platform was \"directly taken from a photoshoot in season 6 of ANTM, where they had to play fairy tale characters and jump\" off a platform. Another \"artefact\" of Top Model's influence on the show comes from Drag Race's focus on runway, with season 8 contestant Kim Chi being \"criticised for not having a model walk\". Most importantly, America's Next Top Model \"was one of the most queer shows on TV\" with regard to the inclusion of Jay Manuel, J. Alexander and Benny Ninja on the judging panel and numerous openly LGBTQ+ contestants, most notably Isis King. It was \"covertly queer enough to make the space on TV for something as queer as Drag Race.\""]}, {"page": "Nigel", "response": ["*Nigel Barker (photographer) (born 1972), English fashion photographer"]}, {"page": "Tatjana Patitz", "response": ["In the book Models of Influence: 50 Women Who Reset The Course of Fashion, author Nigel Barker reviewed Patitz's career during the height of the supermodel era in the 1980s and 1990s, writing that she possessed an exoticism and broad emotional range that set her apart from her peers. In her 2012 memoir, creative director of Vogue Grace Coddington regarded Patitz as one of the original supermodels and a must in photographs and on the catwalk.  Harper's Bazaar wrote, \"Indeed, Patitz's features almost confuse. Like Garbo or the Mona Lisa, the inexplicable gifts of line and luminescence defy definition.\" Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour stated that Patitz had always been one of her favorite models. Patitz's work bridged the eras of the exhibitionist 1980s and the minimalist 1990s in an enduring way, as Barker concluded, \"The most lasting images of her are when she was really looking like herself.\" Author Linda Sivertsen noted that Patitz is greatly responsible for establishing the acceptance of statuesque and curvaceous beauty in an industry of extreme thinness."]}, {"page": "DoSomething", "response": ["Celebrities that have worked with the Teens for Jeans campaign include Nigel Barker, Jay Sean, Nikki Blonsky, Chace Crawford, David Archuleta, Ashley Greene, Justin Long, Demi Lovato, Rachel Crow, Drew Barrymore, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Fifth Harmony, and The Vamps."]}, {"page": "Old Bryanstonians", "response": ["* Nigel Barker (born 1972), fashion photographer, judge on America's Next Top Model"]}, {"page": "Nicole Linkletter", "response": ["Tyra Banks said of Linkletter, \"She's got that 'It' thing.\" Fellow judges Twiggy and Nigel Barker likened Linkletter's look to that of an \"English rose\".

Over her stay, Evans was voted Covergirl of the Week twice, received one first call-out and would have won the Go-See challenge had the final four been on time. It was not until the second half of the contest that she came under criticism for her heavy southern accent, which the judges felt was problematic, as the competition winner would shoot commercials for Covergirl; however, they acknowledged that she could work with a speech coach to eradicate her accent. Evans had two consecutive bottom two appearances in Bangkok where she survived both over Sara Albert and Jade Cole.
