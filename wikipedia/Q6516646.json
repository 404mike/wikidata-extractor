Arthur Hedley was one of the first critics to speak positively of the work, writing in 1947 that it 'works on the hearer's imagination with a power of suggestion equaled only by the F minor Fantasy or the fourth Ballade', although Arthur Rubinstein, Leff Pouishnoff, Claudio Arrau and Vladimir Horowitz had been including it in their programs some decades earlier."]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists", "response": ["* Leff Pouishnoff"]}, {"page": "Piano Concerto No. 4 (Rachmaninoff)", "response": ["Rachmaninoff became discouraged by the Fourth Concerto's lack of success, in both its original and its revised forms. After the initial performances, Rachmaninoff made cuts and other revisions, reducing the first movement from 367 to 346 bars and the finale from 567 to 476 bars; he also removed a few bars from the central Largo. Altogether, he shortened the piece from 1,016 to 902 bars. This was the state in which the concerto was published in 1928 by the composer's publishing firm TAIR in Paris. The British premiere of the work was given on December 2, 1928 by Leff Pouishnoff in a BBC broadcast from Manchester and played several times in the UK in 1929. It was performed in mainland Europe the following year. These were no more successful than the initial performances. Rachmaninoff, more discouraged, withdrew the work until he had time to rework the piece more thoroughly.Harrison, 257."]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists (recorded)", "response": ["* Leff Pouishnoff"]}, {"page": "Anna Yesipova", "response": ["In 1885, Yesipova was appointed Royal Prussian Court Pianist.
