Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year, giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet.

The resulting first album by Portishead, Dummy, was released in 1994. The cover features a still from the band's own short film To Kill a Dead Man.

Better than any album before it, Dummy merged the pinpoint-precise productions of the dance world with pop hallmarks like great songwriting and excellent vocal performances.\" A BBC Music review in 2015 called it \"quite simply one of the greatest debut albums of the 1990s\" and said that \"the constituents that make up much of this collection are easily traced\u00a0\u2013 back to dub, to soul, and especially to hip hop; the array of scratch effects, loops and samples\u00a0...
