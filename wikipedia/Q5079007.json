He began periods as President of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland in 1899 and 1917. He was knighted in 1912 and retired from the British Museum in 1921. He usually dropped the \"Charles\" in his name, especially after he was knighted, though not consistently.  \"A man of handsome and even striking appearance\", he was a major figure in British museum curation in his day, though he published relatively little.", "link_mentions": {}}}
