He is widely acknowledged for promoting artists working in a multitude of genres, including pop, dub reggae, punk rock and post-punk, electronic music and dance music, indie rock, extreme metal, and British hip hop. Fellow DJ Paul Gambaccini described Peel as \"the most important man in music for about a dozen years\".\nPeel's Radio 1 shows were notable for the regular \"Peel sessions\", which usually consisted of four songs recorded by an artist live in the BBC's studios, and which often provided the first major national coverage to bands that would later achieve fame. Another feature was the annual Festive Fifty countdown of his listeners' favourite records of the year.Peel appeared on television occasionally as one of the presenters of Top of the Pops in the 1980s, and provided voice-over commentary for a number of BBC programmes.

Pink Floyd and Soft Machine functioned as house bands at all-night events at locations such as Middle Earth and the UFO Club, where they experimented with sound textures and long-form songs. Many psychedelic, folk rock and early progressive bands were aided by exposure from BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. Jimi Hendrix, who rose to prominence in the London scene and recorded with a band of English musicians, initiated the trend towards guitar virtuosity and eccentricity in rock music.  The Scottish band 1-2-3, later renamed Clouds, were formed in 1966 and began performing at London clubs a year later.

Morrissey's lyrics, while superficially depressing, were often full of mordant humour; John Peel remarked that the Smiths were one of the few bands capable of making him laugh out loud. Influenced by his childhood interest in the social realism of 1960s \"kitchen sink\" television plays, Morrissey wrote about ordinary people and their experiences with despair, rejection and death.

The Cure released their debut single \"Killing an Arab\" in December 1978 on the Small Wonder label as a stopgap until Fiction finalised distribution arrangements with Polydor. \"Killing an Arab\" garnered both acclaim and controversy: while the single's provocative title led to accusations of racism, the song is actually based on French existentialist Albert Camus's novel The Stranger. The band placed a sticker label that denied the racist connotations on the single's 1979 reissue on Fiction. An early NME article on the band wrote that the Cure \"are like a breath of fresh suburban air on the capital's smog-ridden pub-and-club circuit\", and noted: \"With a John Peel session and more extensive London gigging on their immediate agenda, it remains to be seen whether the Cure can retain their refreshing joie de vivre.\""]}, {"page": "Rick Wakeman", "response": ["Wakeman's final album with The Strawbs, From the Witchwood, was released in July 1971.
