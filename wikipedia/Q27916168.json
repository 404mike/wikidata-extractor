Approximately six months earlier, her then-boyfriend (now-husband) South African Raymond Wurwand took a job as a sales representative for a company selling equipment to the skin care industry. Together, they hosted skin therapy classes in the company\u2019s showroom to educate students and promote the equipment. Following the success of their educational programs, Jane and Ray Wurwand created a business plan to continue their courses. By the end of 1983, the couple had launched the school that became the first International Dermal Institute (IDI) in Marina Del Rey. Two years later, Wurwand set out to develop products free of common skin irritants, including lanolin, SD alcohol, mineral oil, artificial colors, and fragrances. This was inspired by student requests, as well as a lack of existing products that Jane Wurwand could use on her skin, which experienced dermatitis and chronic eczema.", "In 2011, The Sunday Times published an article called \"The Woman Who Started a Cult,\" referring to the brand's cult-like following and Germany's suspicion that Dermalogica was affiliated with Scientology. In the article, Jane Wurwand said, \"We had to sign a document declaring we had never been affiliated with Scientology, because there were all these people smiling, saying the same thing so enthusiastically. They assumed we did a form of brainwashing. I suppose I can see why \u2014 we do talk about Dermalogica like a tribe on a mission.\""]}, {"page": "How I Built This", "response": ["|Dermalogica: Jane Wurwand", "|Dermalogica: Jane Wurwand*"]}]}}
