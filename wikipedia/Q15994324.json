Bramwell (born 7 June 1961) is a British physicist and chemist who works at the London Centre for Nanotechnology and the Department of Physics and Astronomy,  University College London. He is known for his experimental discovery of spin ice with M. J. Harris and his calculation of a critical exponent observed in two-dimensional magnets with P. C. W. Holdsworth. A probability distribution for global quantities in complex systems,\nthe \"Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton (BHP) distribution\", (to be implemented in Mathematica) is named after him.In 2009 Bramwell's group was one of several to report experimental evidence of magnetic monopole excitations in spin ice. He coined the term \"magnetricity\" to describe currents of these effective magnetic \"monopoles\" in condensed-matter systems.Bramwell studied chemistry at Oxford University, obtaining his PhD in 1989. He was a professor of physical chemistry at University College London from 2000-2009, before becoming a Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bramwell (name)", "response": ["* Steven T.
