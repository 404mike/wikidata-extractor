He is internationally regarded as a key author for the study of contemporary history.Kitchen was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London.\nNow Professor Emeritus of history at Simon Fraser University, Kitchen started teaching in 1966. He also taught at the Cambridge Group for Population Studies (Cambridge University).Throughout his career, Kitchen has served in several editorial boards such as the International History Review, the Canadian Journal of History / Annales canadiennes d'histoire and International Affairs. Kitchen's work has been translated into French, German, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean and Chinese.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albert Speer", "response": ["Through his autobiographies and interviews, Speer carefully constructed an image of himself as a man who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the Third Reich. He continued to deny explicit knowledge of, and responsibility for the Holocaust. This image dominated his historiography in the decades following the war, giving rise to the \"Speer Myth\": the perception of him as an apolitical technocrat responsible for revolutionizing the German war machine. The myth began to fall apart in the 1980s, when the armaments miracle was attributed to Nazi propaganda. Adam Tooze wrote in The Wages of Destruction that the idea that Speer was an apolitical technocrat was \"absurd\". Martin Kitchen, writing in Speer: Hitler's Architect, stated that much of the increase in Germany's arms production was actually due to systems instituted by Speer's predecessor (Fritz Todt) and furthermore that Speer was intimately involved in the \"Final Solution\".", "During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of Kristallnacht took place. Speer made no mention of it in the first draft of Inside the Third Reich. It was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car. Kristallnacht accelerated Speer's ongoing efforts to dispossess Berlin's Jews from their homes. From 1939 on, Speer's Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer denied he knew they were being put on Holocaust trains and claimed that those displaced were, \"Completely free and their families were still in their apartments\". He also said: \"\u00a0... en route to my ministry on the city highway, I could see\u00a0... crowds of people on the platform of nearby Nikolassee Railroad Station. I knew that these must be Berlin Jews who were being evacuated. I am sure that an oppressive feeling struck me as I drove past. I presumably had a sense of somber events.\" Matthias Schmidt said Speer had personally inspected concentration camps and described his comments as an \"outright farce\". Martin Kitchen described Speer's often repeated line that he knew nothing of the \"dreadful things\" as hollow\u2014because not only was he fully aware of the fate of the Jews he was actively participating in their persecution.", "In 1941, Speer was elected to the Reichstag from electoral constituency 2 (Berlin-West). On 8 February 1942, Reich Minister of Armaments and Munitions Fritz Todt died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitler's eastern headquarters at Rastenburg. Speer arrived there the previous evening and accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin. Speer cancelled some hours before take-off because the previous night he had been up late in a meeting with Hitler. Hitler appointed Speer in Todt's place. Martin Kitchen, a British historian, says that the choice was not surprising. Speer was loyal to Hitler, and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for the military qualified him for the job. Speer succeeded Todt not only as Reich Minister but in all his other powerful positions, including Inspector General of German Roadways, Inspector General for Water and Energy and Head of the Nazi Party's Office of Technology. At the same time, Hitler also appointed Speer as head of the Organisation Todt, a massive, government-controlled construction company. Characteristically Hitler did not give Speer any clear remit; he was left to fight his contemporaries in the regime for power and control. As an example, he wanted to be given power over all armaments issues under Hermann G\u00f6ring's Four Year Plan. G\u00f6ring was reluctant to grant this. However Speer secured Hitler's support, and on 1 March 1942, G\u00f6ring signed a decree naming Speer \"General Plenipotentiary for Armament Tasks\" in the Four Year Plan. Speer proved to be ambitious, unrelenting and ruthless. Speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in the army, but in the whole armed forces. It did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control. By April 1942, Speer had persuaded G\u00f6ring to create a three-member Central Planning Board within the Four Year Plan, which he used to obtain supreme authority over procurement and allocation of raw materials and scheduling of production in order to consolidate German war production in a single agency.", "Speer maintained at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs that he had no direct knowledge of the Holocaust. He admitted only to being uncomfortable around Jews in the published version of the Spandau Diaries. More broadly, Speer accepted responsibility for the Nazi regime's actions. Historian Martin Kitchen states that Speer was actually \"fully aware of what had happened to the Jews\" and was \"intimately involved in the 'Final Solution'\". Brechtken said Speer only admitted to a generalized responsibility for the Holocaust to hide his direct and actual responsibility. Speer was photographed with slave laborers at Mauthausen concentration camp during a visit on 31 March 1943; he also visited Gusen concentration camp. Although survivor Francisco Boix testified at the Nuremberg trials about Speer's visit, Taylor writes that, had the photo been available, he would have been hanged. In 2005, The Daily Telegraph reported that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of Auschwitz concentration camp after two of his assistants inspected the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were massacred. Heinrich Breloer, discussing the construction of Auschwitz, said Speer was not just a cog in the work\u2014he was the \"terror itself\"."]}, {"page": "Erwin Rommel", "response": ["Joachim K\u00e4ppner writes that while the conflict in North Africa was not as bloody as in Eastern Europe, the Afrika Korps committed some war crimes.Der Weg des Afrikakorps nach El Alamein war trotz mancher Kriegsverbrechen nicht wie jener der 6. Armee nach Stalingrad mit Leichen von Zivilisten \u00fcbers\u00e4t.1941: Der Angriff auf die ganze Welt Joachim K\u00e4ppner, 2016 Historian Martin Kitchen states that the reputation of the Afrika Korps was preserved by circumstances: The sparsely populated desert areas did not lend themselves to ethnic cleansing; the German forces never reached the large Jewish populations in Egypt and Palestine; and in the urban areas of Tunisia and Tripolitania the Italian government constrained the German efforts to discriminate against or eliminate Jews who were Italian citizens. Despite this, the North African Jews themselves believed that it was Rommel who prevented the \"Final Solution\" from being carried out against them when German might dominated North Africa from Egypt to Morocco. According to Curtis and Remy, 120,000 Jews lived in Algeria, 200,000 in Morocco, about 80,000 in Tunisia. Remy writes that this number was unchanged following the German invasion of Tunisia in 1942 while Curtis notes that 5000 of these Jews would be sent to forced labour camps. and 26,000 in Libya."]}, {"page": "World War I reparations", "response": ["Bernadotte Schmitt writes that if \"pensions and separation allowances\u00a0...\u00a0not been included, reparations would probably never have become the bogey that poisoned the post-war world for so many years. Taylor says, \"no doubt the impoverishment of Germany was caused by war, not by reparations. Not doubt the Germans could have paid reparations, if they had regarded them as an obligation of honour, honestly incurred.\" However, he says, \"reparations\u00a0 ...\u00a0kept the passions of war alive\". Peter Liberman writes that while the Germans believed they could not meet such demands of them, the \"French believed that Germany could pay and only lacked the requisite will\" to do so. Liberman says this is \"a position that has gained support from recent historical research\". In regard to Germany's capacity to pay, he focuses on coal and says that German coal consumption per capita was higher than France's despite coal shipments being consistently short. He also says, \"the reparations demanded at Versailles were not far out of proportion to German economic potential\" and that in terms of national income it was similar to what the Germans demanded of France following the Franco-Prussian War. Martin Kitchen also says the impression that Germany was crippled by the reparations is a myth. Rather than a weakened Germany, he states the opposite was true."]}, {"page": "Grudzi\u0105dz", "response": ["Professor Martin Kitchen writes that in areas where the Polish population lived alongside Germans a virtual apartheid existed, with bans on the Polish language and religious discrimination, besides attempts to colonize the areas with Germans.A history of modern Germany, 1800\u20132000 Martin Kitchen Wiley-Blackwel 2006, page 130"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Martin Kitchen (born 1936), modern Europe"]}, {"page": "Kaspar Hauser", "response": ["* Martin Kitchen: Kaspar Hauser: Europe's Child.

Arden Bucholz had called Moltke too untrained and inexperienced to understand war planning, which prevented him from having a defence policy from 1906 to 1911; it was the failings of both men that caused them to keep a strategy that was doomed to fail. Foley wrote that Schlieffen and Moltke (the Younger) had good reason to retain  as the foundation of their planning, despite their doubts as to its validity. Schlieffen had been convinced that only in a short war was there the possibility of victory and that by making the army operationally superior to its potential enemies,  could be made to work. The unexpected weakening of the Russian army in 1904\u20131905 and the exposure of its incapacity to conduct a modern war was expected to continue for a long time and this made a short war possible again. Since the French had a defensive strategy, the Germans would have to take the initiative and invade France, which was shown to be feasible by war games in which French border fortifications were outflanked."]}, {"page": "Collectivization in the Soviet Union", "response": ["After the publication of the article, the pressure for collectivization temporarily abated and peasants started leaving collective farms.

Poorly armed and inadequately equipped, the Volkssturm answered not to the Wehrmacht leadership but instead to Himmler in his capacity as the commander of the Reserve Army. Primarily engaged against the Red Army along Germany's eastern corridor, over 175,000 members of this \"rag-tag\" military auxiliary were killed in action. Historian Martin Kitchen describes the establishment of the Volkssturm as a \"pathetic affair.\" Against the advancing Russian, Canadian, American, and British forces, members of the Volkssturm (mainly young and old men, with little training)  were expected to use handheld anti-tank weapons and small arms in the fight alongside the remaining Wehrmacht soldiers in repulsing the onslaught. Even if they were to prove unsuccessful, the Volkssturm was to set a shining example to future generations by fighting to the 'last man and the last bullet' for the Fatherland; as if these efforts would somehow expunge the surrender of 1918.Bernd Wagner, \"Hitler, der Zweite Weltkrieg und die Choreographie des Untergangs,\" Geschichte und Gesellschaft, vol. xxvi (2000), no. 3, pp. 492\u2013518."]}, {"page": "Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi", "response": ["Born the son of a soldier in Kassa, Aba\u00faj-Torna County, Kingdom of Hungary (now Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia) of mixed Armenian (the surname of his great-grandfather was Salossian),Terence Ball.

The unemployment rate at that point in time was close to 30%. At first, the new Nazi government continued the economic policies introduced by the government of Kurt von Schleicher in 1932 to combat the effects of the Depression. Hitler appointed Hjalmar Schacht, a former member of the German Democratic Party, as President of the Reichsbank in 1933 and Minister of Economics in 1934. The policies he inherited included a large public works programs supported by deficit spending\u2014such as the construction of the Autobahn network\u2014to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment.Tooze, \"The Wages of Destruction,\" 2007.

Hjalmar Schacht created a scheme for deficit financing, in which capital projects were paid for with the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills, which could be traded by companies with each other. This was particularly useful in allowing Germany to rearm because the Mefo bills were not Reichsmarks and did not appear in the federal budget, so they helped conceal rearmament.William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2011, p. 260 When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money.
