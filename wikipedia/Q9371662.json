He helped the club to the Third Division title in 1977\u201378, before they reached the Welsh Cup final in 1979. He signed with Port Vale in July 1982, and won promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1982\u201383, also being named as the club's Player of the Year. He joined Blackpool in 1985, as the club won promotion out of the Fourth Division. He then spent a two-year spell with Hereford United, before joining non-league Worcester City in 1987. His final club was Northwich Victoria.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["Promotion was eventually achieved with a third-place finish in 1982\u201383. This was despite McGrath selling Mark Chamberlain and Mark Harrison to Stoke for \u00a3100,000. He made five free signings: John Ridley (a former Valiant), Wayne Cegielski (Wrexham), Les Lawrence (Torquay United), Steve Waddington (Walsall), and Barry Siddall (Sunderland). He further sold Neville Chamberlain to Stoke for \u00a340,000, bringing in burly striker Bob Newton from Hartlepool United for \u00a315,000. Vale went top of the table despite a goalkeeping crisis which saw Barry Siddall, Neville Southall, Neil McAdam, and Andy Poole between the sticks at different points in the campaign. He bought striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, whilst letting Ernie Moss go to Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee after judging him to be too old to be of any further use. With 34 goals conceded, Vale had the best defensive record in the Football League."]}]}}
