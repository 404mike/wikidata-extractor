Kleene introduced the concepts of relative computability, foreshadowed by Turing, and the arithmetical hierarchy. Kleene later generalized recursion theory to higher-order functionals. Kleene and Georg Kreisel studied formal versions of intuitionistic mathematics, particularly in the context of proof theory."]}, {"page": "History of logic", "response": ["In proof theory, the relationship between classical mathematics and intuitionistic mathematics was clarified via tools such as the realizability method invented by Georg Kreisel and G\u00f6del's Dialectica interpretation. This work inspired the contemporary area of proof mining. The Curry\u2013Howard correspondence emerged as a deep analogy between logic and computation, including a correspondence between systems of natural deduction and typed lambda calculi used in computer science.  As a result, research into this class of formal systems began to address both logical and computational aspects; this area of research came to be known as modern type theory.  Advances were also made in ordinal analysis and the study of independence results in arithmetic such as the Paris\u2013Harrington theorem."]}, {"page": "List of Austrians", "response": ["*Georg Kreisel, philosopher and mathematician", "*Georg Kreisel, philosopher and mathematician"]}, {"page": "Skewes's number", "response": ["Skewes' task was to make Littlewood's existence proof effective: exhibiting some concrete upper bound for the first sign change.
