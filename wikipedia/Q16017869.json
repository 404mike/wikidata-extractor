Denness was selected to play cricket for Scotland against Ireland in 1959 while still at school.  Former Kent bowler Jimmy Allan was also in the Scotland team, and he suggested Denness's name to his former county.  E. W.

He made his first-class debut for Cambridge University against Sussex in May 1936, scoring 93 (which was to remain his highest score for the university) before being out lbw to the bowling of Charles Oakes. He won his blue that season, playing in the Varsity Match at Lord's where he made 19 and 5.

Only Jim Cornford performed consistently well among the bowlers while six batsmen scored over 1,000 runs. Three of these exceeded 2,000 in all matches: John Langridge, George Cox and Harry Parks. James Langridge reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to appendicitis. Charles Oakes and new captain Hugh Bartlett were the other two. His predecessor turned club secretary Billy Griffith had a poor season with the bat but kept wicket well enough to be selected for England's winter tour. Other players who appeared were Paul Carey, Donald Smith, Jim Wood, Jack Oakes, John Nye and two future Test players Alan Oakman and David Sheppard.Playfair, pp. 99\u2013100."]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Charles Oakes 27"]}, {"page": "Oakes (surname)", "response": ["*Charles Oakes (1861\u20131928), Australian politician", "*Charles Oakes (cricketer) (1912\u20132007), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Sussex County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Charles Oakes (1935\u20131954) : C.
