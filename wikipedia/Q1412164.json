He was known as \"Slipper of the Yard\" (referring to Scotland Yard).  He was mainly known for his role in investigating the Great Train Robbery of 1963, and in tracking down Ronnie Biggs after he escaped from prison in 1965, although he had to leave Brazil without Biggs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Train Robbery (1963)", "response": ["The squad later had to work out rotations whereby one member would go home to rest as otherwise they were getting only three hours of sleep per night and had no time to eat healthily or see their families.  When the squad tried to get him to ease the working conditions, Butler was enraged and threatened to send them back to their normal duties.  Butler was said to be very secretive, with Jack Slipper claiming in his book Slipper of the Yard (1981) that \"he wouldn't even tell his own left hand what the right one was doing\".  This meant that Train Robbery Squad members were often dispatched on errands with no knowledge of how their tasks fitted into the overall investigation.", "The six-man Train Robbery Squad consisted of Detective Inspector Frank Williams, Detective Sergeant Steve Moore, Detective Sergeant Jack Slipper, Detective Sergeant Jim Nevill, Detective Sergeant Lou Van Dyck and Detective Constable Tommy Thorburn. The senior officer, Frank Williams, was a quiet man.  His speciality was dealing with informants and he had the best working knowledge of the south London criminal fraternity in the force.  One of the squad, Jack Slipper, would later become head of the Flying Squad and would still be involved in the case many years later.", "Several weeks later, the police went to Field's house to interview him.  He calmly (for someone whose relatives had dumped a large part at least of the loot) provided a cover story that implicated Lennie Field as the purchaser of the farm and his boss John Wheater as the conveyancer.  He admitted to visiting the farm on one occasion with Lennie Field, but said he assumed it was an investment of his brother Alexander Field, whom Brian Field had defended (unsuccessfully) in a recent court case.  Field, not knowing the police had found a receipt, readily confirmed that he and his wife had been to Germany on a holiday and gave them the details of the place at which they had stayed.  On 15 September 1963 Brian Field was arrested and his boss John Wheater was arrested two days later.  Lennie Field had already been arrested on 14 September. Jack Slipper was involved in the capture of Roy James, Ronald Biggs, Jimmy Hussey and John Daly.", "Jack Slipper of the Metropolitan Police was promoted to detective chief superintendent. He became so involved in the case that he continued to hunt many of the escaped robbers after he retired. He believed Biggs should not be released after returning to the UK in 2001 and he often appeared in the media to comment on any news item connected with the robbery before his death on 24 August 2005 at the age of 81.", "* Slipper of the Yard (1981) by Jack Slipper, first published by Sidgwick and Jackson Ltd ().
