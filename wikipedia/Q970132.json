He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at \"half pace\". His long-term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground's Butler Street stand, and a lack of adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair; Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 1976\u201377. Following relegation Smith formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 1978\u201379 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were \"boring\", as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too much of a threat for him."]}, {"page": "Alan Oakes", "response": ["His last appearance for Manchester City came on 4 May 1976, coming on as substitute for Mike Doyle against rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford. In his time at Maine Road, Oakes had become part of more trophy winning sides than any other Manchester City player in history.Gary James, Manchester: The Greatest City  He was voted the club's Player of the Year in 1975. Amongst footballing figures of his era Oakes was renowned for his professionalism; the great Liverpool manager Bill Shankly described him as \"exactly the kind of player youngsters should use as a model\". He made 680 league and cup appearances for Manchester City, scoring 33 goals. The only City player to come close to his record was Joe Corrigan, a goalkeeper who played alongside Oakes for nine years. Oakes was inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame in 2005."]}]}}
