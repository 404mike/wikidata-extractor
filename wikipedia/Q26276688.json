However, three Kenyan immigrants to other countries ran in the final; Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo and 41-year-old Bernard Lagat of the United States and Albert Kibichii Rop of Bahrain. The East African representation was strong with three Ethiopians in the final (plus Birhanu Balew running for Bahrain).  Uganda qualified two athletes.  Mohammed Ahmed running for Canada, Hassan Mead running for the United States and the defending champion Mo Farah running for Great Britain were born in Somalia.  Andrew Butchart was a second British finalist, and David Torrence, an American-born athlete, ran for Peru.  During the first preliminary heat, Mead's front foot met Farah's back foot, both runners stumbling, Mead crashing to the track.  Farah righted himself and continued on to the finish, qualifying third.   After the race a successful protest was filed by the United States, and Mead advanced to the final as a result.

Chelimo took the field through an aggressive 62\u00a0second lap. The second lap was a decidedly more relaxed 71\u00a0seconds, bringing Andrew Butchart (GBR) to the front, to look at Chelimo then take the point with his teammate Farah in tow. But Butchart didn't increase the pace, instead it slowed slightly to 72\u00a0seconds. Muktar Edris (ETH) came forward. After running shoulder to shoulder with Farah for 200\u00a0metres, Edris went out into the lead, but the pace didn't quicken. After another slow lap, he slowed and left Farah exposed on the front. 17\u00a0year old 2016 World Junior Champion Selemon Barega came from the back of the pack to take the lead. Barega increased the pace opening up several metres on Farah at the head of the pack with a 65\u00a0second lap, then he slowed again an Ethiopian leaving Farah exposed on the front of the pack.
