After a brief stay in Madras, he was assigned as a Civil Surgeon to Tenasserim, Burma, where he studied local plants and made collecting trips to the Barak River valley in Assam. He explored various parts of Burma, traveling the rivers, including the Irrawadi as far as Rangoon. He visited the highlands of Sikkim, and the region of the Himalayas around Shimla. Subsequently, Griffith was appointed as Civil Surgeon in Malacca, where he died of a parasitic liver disease.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*William Griffith"]}, {"page": "John McClelland (doctor)", "response": ["In 1835 he was sent on a mission (Tea Committee) to identify if tea could be grown in north-eastern India along with Nathaniel Wallich and William Griffith.

The specific epithet atriplicifolia means \"with leaves like Atriplex\", referring to its similarity to saltbush. While commonly known as Russian sage, S.\u00a0yangii is not native to Russia."]}, {"page": "Assam tea", "response": ["While on a trade expedition through the Assam area with Singpho in 1823 Robert Bruce was introduced to a plant with which the Singpho and Khamti people made beverages and food. Through his brother, Charles Alexander Bruce who was in Sadiya, samples were sent to botanist Nathaniel Wallich who mistook it for camellia kissi. It was not until over a decade later that the Singpho's plant would be recognized as being the same plant as the Camellia sinensis growing in China, after Francis Jenkins and Andrew Charlton responded to the request of the British East India Company's Tea Committee for its agents to review prospects for establishing a source of tea outside of China. Charles Bruce guided a team, including Nathaniel Wallich, William Griffith and John McClelland, dispatched from the Tea Committee in 1836, to review the plant in its natural growing conditions around Sadiya. It was cultivated in the company's experimental garden with the first batch shipped to London in 1838 and auctioned in January 1839. Though it sold well the batch was noted as lacking fragrance compared to the tea from China which had been selectively cultivated for hundreds of years and having a dullness thought to be a consequence of inexperienced processing. That same year, two companies were incorporated to pursue the tea's development in Assam: the Assam Tea Association in London and the Bengal Tea Association in Kolkata, though they quickly amalgamated to form the Assam Company. Despite early proponents such as Maniram Dewan, British-led land reforms such as the Waste Lands Act to clear and privatize plots of land for agricultural purposes, the Assam Company struggled and was forced to reorganize in 1847. Similarly, despite having access to a large source of inexpensive labour, including tea-makers smuggled out of China, indentured Indians, and refugees from famine-striken areas, Assam at the time was a sparsely-populated, hot and humid undeveloped area and many died of disease. Despite the poor results, investment came from Britain to establish additional tea gardens, such as the Jorehaut Tea Company around Jorhat, in 1860s though by 1870 56 of the 60 companies operating tea gardens in Assam went bankrupt. Industrial mechanization in the 1870s finally resulted in profitable companies as more plucked leaves were able to be dried without rotting in the humid environment. Heated withering tables and steam-powered rolling machines precipitated a need for grading so the British adapted the existing systems of tea leaf grading to sort their products. The Indian Tea Districts Association was established in London in 1879 and in Kolkata in 1881 (as the Indian Tea Association) to organize and advance these tea interests. By 1888 tea imported from India finally exceeded that from China."]}, {"page": "Nathaniel Wallich", "response": ["The three volumes of Plantae Asiaticae Rariores made use of artists employed by the Calcutta Botanic Garden: 146 drawings by Gorachand, 109 by Vishnupersaud and one work by Rungiah (the artist employed by Robert Wight); the rest of the plates were by John Clark and three by William Griffith.

Wallich went on extended leave in 1828 to supervise the printing and hand-colouring of the illustrations in England. Foremost of the watercolour artists who executed the original paintings were two Indian artists, Vishnupersaud, responsible for 114 plates and Gorachand for 87. Vishnupersaud (occasionally referred to as Vishnu Prasad) was an Indian artist frequently employed by naturalists working in India, such as John Forbes Royle and Francis Buchanan-Hamilton.  Vishnupersaud\u2019s skill was legendary and Wilfrid Blunt included one of his watercolours in his book The Art of Botanical Illustration as displaying great craftsmanship. The remaining plates were done by Charles M. Curtis (7), William Griffith (3), Sarah Drake, and various others.

The name has been attributed to Carl Borivoj Presl as well as to Sternberg.Roland W. Brown. 1946. page 348. In: \"Alterations in some fossil and living floras\". Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences. 36(10):344-355. In 1836, Robert Brown, unaware that the name had already been taken, published the name Bucklandia populnea for the tree now known as Exbucklandia populnea Robert Brown. 1836.

CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington,DC;, USA. London, UK.  (vol. II). (see External links below). In the case of Bucklandia, Brown did not meet the requirements of valid publication, but the name was validated by William Griffith, posthumously, in 1847.William Griffith. 1847. Journals of Travels in Assam Burma Bootan Affghanistan and the Neighbouring Countries (sic). Bishop's College Press: Calcutta. (reprinted 2001. Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, New Delhi). In 1924, Paul Henri Lecomte named a second species, Bucklandia tonkinensis.Paul Henri Lecomte. 1924. Bulletin du Mus\u00e9um d'Histoire Naturelle. Paris. 30:392. For more than 100 years, it remained unnoticed that two genera of plants had received the name Bucklandia. This conflict was finally resolved by Roland W. Brown in 1946. At that time, Brown wrote, \"Inasmuch as the 1825 cycadeoid name has priority, the witchhazel genus requires a new name. For this purpose, I propose Exbucklandia, the derivation of which is obvious.\" Unaware of Brown's paper, Cornelis G.G.J. van Steenis sought to resolve the conflict of names in 1952 by replacing Bucklandia with Symingtonia.Cornelis G.G.J. van Steenis. 1952. Acta Botanica Neerlandica 1:443-444. He published a notice of this oversight in 1954, acknowledging the priority of Exbucklandia over Symingtonia.Cornelis G.G.J. van Steenis. 1954. page 595. In: \"Miscellaneous Botanical Notes VI\". Blumea 7(3):595-598. In that paper, van Steenis transferred the second species to Exbucklandia, because Roland Brown had not explicitly done so in 1946. Thus van Steenis originated the combination Exbucklandia tonkinensis, but not validly, because he failed to cite the publication of the basionym as the ICBN has required since 1953. In 1959, Hung-Ta Chang validly made the combination Exbucklandia tonkinensis.Hung-Ta Chang. 1959. Acta Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Sunyatseni. 1959(2). In that same paper, Chang described and named the third species, Exbucklandia longipetala. A taxonomic history and a description of each of the three species can be found in Flora of China volume 9."]}]}}
