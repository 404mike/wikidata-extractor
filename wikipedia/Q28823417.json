It was recorded at Dierks-Studios, in Cologne, from September 1988 to January 1989. Although Jim Stacey is presented as rhythm guitar player in the album line-up, the album credits also state that all guitar work on the album was played by Wolf Hoffmann. Jim Stacey did perform second guitar live with the band.", "* Jim Stacey \u2013 rhythm guitar in live shows", "The Eat the Heat tour consisted of David Reece on vocals, Wolf Hoffmann on lead guitar, Peter Baltes on bass, Stefan Kaufmann on drums, and Jim Stacey (ex-Break Point) on rhythm guitar. The first leg of the tour consisted of the band headlining at small clubs around the U.S. for about two months. Kaufmann sustained a back injury during this period, and was replaced by House of Lords drummer Ken Mary. Accept then began a North American act with W.A.S.P. and Metal Church. The tour overall was a disappointment, plagued with poor attendance numbers and a failure to draw the American crowds that the band had hoped to appeal to with this new lineup. A rumored behind-stage fight at the Vic Theater in Chicago between Reece and Baltes led to the band splitting up, and the tour was subsequently cancelled."]}, {"page": "List of Accept band members", "response": ["In 1987, Dirkschneider was fired from Accept and subsequently pursued a solo career under the moniker U.D.O. He was replaced by a succession of temporary vocalists, before the band settled on David Reece and released Eat the Heat in 1989. Fischer left again before the recording of the album. Jim Stacey joined on rhythm guitar for the album's promotional tour, which also saw Ken Mary take over from Kaufmann after the regular drummer suffered a back injury. Accept subsequently decided to disband, after increasing differences with Reece and Kaufmann's injury. By 1992, the band had returned with a lineup of Dirkschneider, Hoffmann, Baltes and Kaufmann, releasing Objection Overruled the next year. Kaufmann was forced to leave again after the release of Death Row, with Stefan Schwarzmann taking his place.", "|Jim Stacey", "*Jim Stacey \u2013 rhythm guitar", "*Jim Stacey \u2013 rhythm guitar"]}]}}
