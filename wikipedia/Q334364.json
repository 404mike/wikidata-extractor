His main works were A General Synopsis of Birds (1781\u20131801) and General History of Birds (1821\u20131828). He was able to examine specimens of Australian birds which reached England in the last twenty years of the 18th century, and was responsible for providing English names for many of them. He named some of Australia's most famous birds, including the emu, sulphur-crested cockatoo, wedge-tailed eagle, superb lyrebird, Australian magpie, magpie-lark and pheasant coucal. He was also the first to describe the hyacinth macaw. Latham has been called the \"grandfather\" of Australian ornithology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of extinct bird species since 1500", "response": [":This subspecies of the metallic pigeon is only known from a footnote in John Latham's General History of Birds and seems to have died out some time before 1800; possibly, the location is erroneous and the note really refers to the extant population on Fiji."]}, {"page": "Lyrebird", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Latham (ornithologist)"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["* John Latham (1740\u20131837), English naturalistAbbreviation in zoology: Latham who named many Australian birds, author of A General Synopsis of Birds"]}, {"page": "Black swan", "response": ["The black swan was introduced to various countries as an ornamental bird in the 1800s, but has managed to escape and form stable populations.

In his original 1816 description of the emu, the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot used two generic names, first Dromiceius and later Dromaius. It has been a point of contention ever since as to which name should be used; the latter is more correctly formed, but the convention in taxonomy is that the first name given to an organism stands, unless it is clearly a typographical error.

Its specific name is derived from the Ancient Greek leuko- 'white', and gaster 'belly'. Its closest relative is the little-known Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands. These form a superspecies, and as is usual in other sea eagle superspecies, one (the white-bellied sea eagle) has a white head, as opposed to the other species' dark head. The bill and eyes are dark, and the talons are dark yellow as in all Southern Hemisphere sea eagles. Both these species have at least some dark colouration in their tails, though this may not always be clearly visible in the white-bellied sea eagle. The nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome b gene of the two sea eagles were among those analysed in a 1996 study. Although they differ greatly in appearance and ecology, their genetic divergence of 0.3% indicates that the ancestors of the two forms might have diverged as recently as 150,000 years ago. The study authors conclude that although the genetic divergence is more consistent with subspecies, the distinctness in appearance and behaviour warrants the two being retained as separate species. Mitochondrial sequence of the cytochrome b locus differs very slightly from that of Sanford's sea eagle suggesting a relatively recent divergence after New Guinea-based white-bellied sea eagles colonised the Solomon Islands."]}, {"page": "Great crested grebe", "response": ["The great crested grebe was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Colymbus cristatus.
