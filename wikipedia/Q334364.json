His main works were A General Synopsis of Birds (1781\u20131801) and General History of Birds (1821\u20131828). He was able to examine specimens of Australian birds which reached England in the last twenty years of the 18th century, and was responsible for providing English names for many of them. He named Australia's famous birds, these included the emu, sulphur-crested cockatoo, wedge-tailed eagle, superb lyrebird, Australian magpie, Magpie Lark and Pheasant coucal. He was also the first to describe the hyacinth macaw. Latham has been called the \"grandfather\" of Australian ornithology.", "link_mentions": {}}}
