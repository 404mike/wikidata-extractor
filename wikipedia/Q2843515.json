He moved on to Bristol Rovers and Redbridge before establishing himself with Scottish Premier League side Kilmarnock where he remained for six years. He moved to Chesterfield in 2010 and was released after two seasons. He returned to Grimsby Town in the summer of 2012 but only made two appearances and was loaned out for a spell at AFC Telford United.

He notably scored his only goal for Grimsby in a 2\u20130 victory over local rivals and fellow relegation strugglers Sheffield Wednesday, towering above his marker to power home a header from the centre of the penalty area following a Stuart Campbell corner. Santos became a popular figure amongst the club's supporters and he was singled out for a lot of praise despite the club's overall poor form during the season. Initially signed as a midfielder, Santos had been drafted in as a makeshift centre half when Steve Chettle was ruled out for a lengthy period. He was usually paired with Jamaican youngster Simon Ford or player/manager Paul Groves who incidentally this season had adopted playing at centre half in opposed to his regular central midfield sitting. Despite the best efforts of Santos he was unable to help save the Mariners from relegation from the First Division, but went on to be awarded with the Player of the Season award for his stone wall like performances at the back. Despite winning this award and putting himself in the running for club captain for the 2003\u20132004 campaign, Santos rejected a new contract in order to stay in the First Division."]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Simon Ford||||CB||2001\u20132004||78||4"]}, {"page": "Steve Chettle", "response": ["In July 2002, two months after his release from Barnsley, Chettle and fellow Tykes defender Darren Barnard joined league rivals Grimsby Town on one-year contracts. Chettle was seen as an ideal candidate to step in the centre of defence and started the season alongside the club's player-manager Paul Groves and Jamaican youngster Simon Ford. After a slow start to the season for Grimsby, Steve saw his season blighted by injury, and through this, it pushed manager Groves into signing Sheffield United centre half Georges Santos and Middlesbrough's Jason Gavin as cover. Steve eventually returned from injury in early 2003, and went on to score his only goal for The Mariners in a 4\u20131 home defeat against Crystal Palace.

His career at Grimsby was dogged with controversy, despite being a fans favourate, his disciplinary record wasn't the greatest, clocking up 15 yellow cards and two red cards in his debut season.
