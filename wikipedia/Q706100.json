He studied for five years at Trinity College, Cambridge, and another nine at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He had already built a reputation as a scholar and outstanding preacher when he accepted the position of minister at St. Botolph's Church, Boston in Lincolnshire, in 1612. As a Puritan, he wanted to do away with the ceremony and vestments associated with the established Church of England and to preach in a simpler manner. He felt that the English church needed significant reforms, but he was adamant about not separating from it; his preference was to change it from within.\nMany ministers were removed from their pulpits in England for their Puritan practices, but Cotton thrived at St. Botolph's for nearly 20 years because of supportive aldermen and lenient bishops, as well as his conciliatory and gentle demeanor. By 1632, however, the church authorities had greatly increased pressure on non-conforming clergy, and Cotton was forced into hiding. The following year, he and his wife boarded a ship for New England.\nCotton was highly sought as a minister in Massachusetts and was quickly installed as the second pastor of the Boston church, sharing the ministry with John Wilson. He generated more religious conversions in his first six months than had been made the whole previous year. Early in his Boston tenure, he became involved in the banishment of Roger Williams, who blamed much of his trouble on Cotton. Soon after, Cotton became embroiled in the colony's Antinomian Controversy when several adherents of his \"free grace\" theology (most notably Anne Hutchinson) began criticizing other ministers in the colony. He tended to support his adherents through much of that controversy; near its conclusion, however, he realized that many of them held theological positions that were well outside the mainstream of Puritan orthodoxy, which he did not condone.\nFollowing the controversy, Cotton was able to mend fences with his fellow ministers, and he continued to preach in the Boston church until his death. A great part of his effort during his later career was devoted to the governance of the New England churches, and he was the one who gave the name Congregationalism to this form of church polity. A new form of polity was being decided for the Church of England in the early 1640s, as the Puritans in England gained power on the eve of the English Civil War, and Cotton wrote numerous letters and books in support of the \"New England Way\". Ultimately, Presbyterianism was chosen as the form of governance for the Church of England during the Westminster Assembly in 1643, though Cotton continued to engage in a polemic contest with several prominent Presbyterians on this issue.\nCotton became more conservative with age. He battled the separatist attitude of Roger Williams and advocated severe punishment for those whom he deemed heretics, such as Samuel Gorton. He was a scholar, an avid letter writer, and the author of many books, and was considered the \"prime mover\" among New England's ministers. He died in December 1652 at age 67, following a month-long illness. His grandson Cotton Mather also became a New England minister and historian.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 4", "response": ["*1585 \u2013 John Cotton, English-American minister and theologian (d. 1652)"]}, {"page": "Puritans", "response": ["In current English, puritan often means \"against pleasure\". In such usage, hedonism and puritanism are antonyms.H. L. Mencken, \"Puritanism: The haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy\", from A Book of Burlesques (1916), is a classic rendering. Puritans embraced sexuality but placed it in the context of marriage. Peter Gay writes of the Puritans' standard reputation for \"dour prudery\" as a \"misreading that went unquestioned in the nineteenth century\", commenting how unpuritanical they were in favour of married sexuality, and in opposition to the Catholic veneration of virginity, citing Edward Taylor and John Cotton. One Puritan settlement in western Massachusetts banished a husband because he refused to fulfill his sexual duties to his wife.", "Puritan hegemony lasted for at least a century. That century can be broken down into three parts: the generation of John Cotton and Richard Mather, 1630\u201362 from the founding to the Restoration, years of virtual independence and nearly autonomous development; the generation of Increase Mather, 1662\u201389 from the Restoration and the Halfway Covenant to the Glorious Revolution, years of struggle with the British crown; and the generation of Cotton Mather, 1689\u20131728 from the overthrow of Edmund Andros (in which Cotton Mather played a part) and the new charter, mediated by Increase Mather, to the death of Cotton Mather.", "Bounds were not set on enjoying sexuality within the bounds of marriage, as a gift from God.: \"On many questions and specially in view of the marriage bed, the Puritans were the indulgent party, ... they were much more Chestertonian than their adversaries [the Roman Catholics]. The idea that a Puritan was a repressed and repressive person would have astonished Sir Thomas More and Luther about equally.\" Spouses were disciplined if they did not perform their sexual marital duties, in accordance with 1 Corinthians 7 and other biblical passages. Women and men were equally expected to fulfill marital responsibilities. Women and men could file for divorce based on this issue alone. In Massachusetts colony, which had some of the most liberal colonial divorce laws, one out of every six divorce petitions was filed on the basis of male impotence. Puritans publicly punished drunkenness and sexual relations outside marriage. Couples who had sex during their engagement were fined and publicly humiliated. Men, and a handful of women, who engaged in homosexual behavior, were seen as especially sinful, with some executed. While the practice of execution was also infrequently used for rape and adultery, homosexuality was actually seen as a worse sin. Passages from the Old Testament, including Lev 20:13., were thought to support the disgust for homosexuality and efforts to purge society of it. New Haven code stated \"If any man lyeth with mankinde, as a man lyeth with a woman, both of them have committed abomination, they shall surely be put to death\" and in 1636 John Cotton proposed the Sodomy Law which would make both male and female homosexuality a capital crime. Prominent authors such as Thomas Cobbert, Samual Danforth and Cotton Mather wrote pieces condemning homosexuality. Cotton Mather, well-known author and religious leader, wrote several pieces that addressed homosexuality including \"Addresses to old men, and young men, and little children\" where he argued the passage \"Overcome the Devil when he tempts you to the youthful sin of Uncleanness\" was referring \"probably to the young men of Sodom\"."]}, {"page": "1652", "response": ["* December 23 \u2013 John Cotton, founder of Boston, Massachusetts (b. 1585)"]}, {"page": "1585", "response": ["** John Cotton, clergyman in England and the American colonies, founder of Boston (d. 1652)"]}, {"page": "Roger Williams", "response": ["Williams's career as an author began with A Key into the Language of America (London, 1643), written during his first voyage to England.

The Scottish minister John Wemyss advocated readmitting Jews to Christian lands with a view to converting them in the 1630s. So, by the 1640s the imminent conversion of the Jews was a widespread belief among Puritans. Indeed during that decade the Christians who were most liberal towards Jews are also those who were most committed to their conversion. A number of these \u2018admissionists\u2019 were close to Cromwell, including John Sadler, John Dury, and Hugh Peter. Other notable readmissionists include exiled Royalist cleric Thomas Barlow and the Dissenter Henry Jessey. The Fifth Monarchy Men were another example of Puritan millenarians who saw the readmission of the Jews as hastening the kingdom of Christ. The exiled Royalist Sir Edward Nicholas is one of the few admissionists who did not seem interested in conversion. By contrast, the anti-admissionists were often animated by the belief that it would be difficult or impossible to convert the Jews. William Prynne\u2019s anti-Semitic pamphlet A Short Demurrer, which was printed on the eve of the Whitehall Conference, and the pamphlet Anglo-Judaeus or The History of the Jews Whilst Here in England by W.H. both doubt that the Jews would be converted once in England.Scult, Mel (1978).

Historian Michael Winship more pointedly called it a \"bitterly uncharitable sermon\" and the \"most notorious Boston contribution to the escalation of pulpit rhetoric\". There was no immediate reaction to the sermon, other than Winthrop noting in his journal that \"the ministers were now disputing the doctrinal issues in their pulpits\". He also noted that Cotton alone was of one party against the other ministers, not even thinking of Wheelwright as being a player in the developing controversy."]}, {"page": "Reverend John Cotton", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Cotton (minister)"]}, {"page": "John Thayer (ornithologist)", "response": ["His maternal grandparents were Stephen Van Rensselaer IV (the 10th Patroon and 7th Lord of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck) and Harriet Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Bayard) Van Rensselaer.
