Zara denies this, but it is later revealed that they have met previously. Zara asks Daniel to use his charm on Judith when she comes for Botox treatment in his clinic. Afterwards, Zara asks Daniel to seduce Judith and have sex with her, to which he declines this immediately. After months of dates and casual sex, Zara and Daniel become a couple. Zara then starts having hot flushes and menopausal symptoms, and realises she is undergoing early menopause. Zara believes Daniel wants to end the relationship a couple of days later, so she ends it first. Daniel traps Zara in her office and they get back together. Daniel and Zara try IVF, and are left devastated when they discover it has not worked and she is not pregnant. Zara begins showing the signs of pregnancy, and Daniel rushes out to a chemist; when he returns, Zara is sitting on the bed with a pregnancy test in her hands. After Daniel tells her that he loves her, she reveals the results of the test, and both she and Daniel are overjoyed to discover that she is pregnant. Zara goes into premature labour at the Mill, with only Cherry Clay (Sophie Abelson) and Kevin Tyler (Simon Rivers) around to help her. Zara gives birth to a baby boy named Joe (Emily and Lewis Whitehouse). Daniel arrives shortly after and Zara, Daniel and their baby are taken to hospital.
