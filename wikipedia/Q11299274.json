In July 1840, he sought new land further north in the Moreton Bay district (as it was then known, now called Queensland)  based on advice from Patrick Leslie. With a partner, Gilbert Eliott, and his brother, Christopher Pemberton Hodgson, Arthur Hodgson squatted Eton Vale, the second pastoral run on the Darling Downs in September 1840. In the 1846 publication, Reminiscences of Australia with Hints on the Squatters' Life, Hodgson's brother describes the conflict involved in the taking of land ownership from Aboriginal Australians. They named this property Etonvale after Eton College, the illustrious school they both attended in England.  The land they marked out was in the possession of the Barunggam people and the book recorded in some detail their \"constant skirmishes with the natives\" to wrest control of the area, and how \"so many hundreds of these poor creatures have been sacrificed\". The Hodgson brothers took an active role in the killings. The homestead was decorated with \"swords, guns and..all around are displayed spears, boomerangs..dillies and calabashes, the spoil of a hard fought battle or a surprised camp of natives.\""]}, {"page": "Squatting (Australian history)", "response": ["The term soon developed a class association, suggesting an elevated socio-economic status and entrepreneurial attitude. By 1840 squatters were recognized as being amongst the wealthiest men in the colony of New South Wales, many of them from upper and middle-class English and Scottish families. As unoccupied land with frontage to permanent water became more scarce, the acquisition of runs increasingly required larger capital outlays. A \"run\" is defined in Christopher Pemberton Hodgson's 1846 Reminiscences of Australia, with Hints on the Squatter's Life as: \"land claimed by the Squatter as sheepwalks, open, as nature left them, without any improvement from the Squatter.\""]}, {"page": "Eton Vale Homestead Ruins", "response": ["Eton Vale Station was squatted in 1840 by brothers Arthur Hodgson and Christopher Pemberton Hodgson who had followed the Leslie Brothers onto the Darling Downs. It was the second run selected in Queensland. At the time it covered an area of . Originally a grazing property, wheat was grown from 1846 and it became a sheep stud in 1850. The slab house, erected soon after 1840 formed the core of a larger brick residence which continued to be added to up to as late as 1880. In the late 1840s, the squatters of the Darling Downs were able to purchase pastoral leases. Darling Downs became known as the 'jewel in the diadem of squatterdom' with an elite class living in comfortable houses."]}, {"page": "C.
