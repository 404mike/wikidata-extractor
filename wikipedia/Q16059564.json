For over twenty years, she lived and worked among the sailors of the Royal Navy. The result of her powerful influence is evidenced in the widespread reform which took place in the habits of hundreds of men to whom her name was a talisman for good. In her day, one man in six in the navy was a total abstainer. Weston's work included her monthly letters to sailors, Ashore and Afloat, which she edited, and the \"Sailors' Rests\", which she established in Portsmouth. She was the first woman given a full ceremonial Royal Navy funeral.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Prohibition", "response": ["On 22 March 1917, during the First World War at a crowded meeting in the Queen's Hall in London (chaired by Alfred Booth) many influential people including Agnes Weston spoke, or letters from them were read out, against alcohol consumption, calling for prohibition; General Sir Reginald Hart wrote to the meeting that \"Every experienced officer knew that practically all unhappiness and crime in the Army is due to drink\". At the meeting, Lord Channing said that it was a pity that the whole Cabinet did not follow the example of King George V and Lord Kitchener when in 1914 those two spoke calling for complete prohibition for the duration of the war.Daily Telegraph, Friday 23 March 1917, reprinted in Daily Telegraph, Thursday 23 March 2017, p. 30"]}, {"page": "Woman's Christian Temperance Union", "response": ["*Agnes Weston"]}, {"page": "Aggie", "response": ["* Agnes Weston (1840\u20131918), English philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Arthur Young (police officer)", "response": ["His Hertfordshire years also saw the beginnings of a professional relationship with James Callaghan. They already knew each other from Portsmouth, where their mothers had both worked at Agnes Weston's Sailors Rest; Callaghan had tried unsuccessfully to court his sister, Eileen. Callaghan was now a junior minister at the Ministry of Transport. They met up with each other again on a road safety committee and became working allies to extend speed restrictions and improve road markings; cat's eyes were perhaps the most significant fruit of their labours. They worked together again when Callaghan was Home Secretary and it was Callaghan who selected Young to go to Ulster in 1969 to implement the Hunt Report."]}, {"page": "HMS Victoria (1887)", "response": ["Victoria capsized just 13 minutes after the collision, rotating to starboard with a terrible crash as her boats and anything free fell to the side and as water entering through the funnels caused explosions when it reached the boilers. With her keel uppermost, she slipped into the water bow first, propellers still rotating and threatening anyone near them. Most of the crew managed to abandon ship, although those in the engine room never received orders to leave their posts and were drowned. The ship's chaplain, Rev S. D. Morris RN, was last seen trying to rescue the sick: \"In the hour of danger and of death, when all were acting bravely, he was conspicuous for his self-denying and successful efforts to save the sick and to maintain discipline.  Nobly forgetful of his own safety, he worked with others to the end, and went down with the vessel ... seeing escape impossible he folded his arms upon his breast, and looking up to heaven, his lips moving in prayer, he died.\"Agnes Weston: My Life among the Bluejackets, James Nisbett: London, 1909. Page 174. The area around the wreck became a \"widening circle of foaming bubbles, like a giant saucepan of boiling milk\", which the rescue boats did not dare enter. Onlookers could only watch as the number of live men in the water steadily diminished. Gunner Frederick Johnson reported being sucked down three times, and said that while originally there were 30\u201340 people around him, afterwards there were only three or four.Hough pp. 93\u201398. Lieutenant Lorin, one of the survivors, stated: \"All sorts of floating articles came up with tremendous force, and the surface of the water was one seething mass. We were whirled round and round, and half choked with water, and dashed about amongst the wreckage until half senseless.\"", "The news of the accident caused a sensation and appalled the British public at a time when the Royal Navy occupied a prime position in the national consciousness. News was initially scarce, and a crowd of thousands of friends and relatives laid siege to the Admiralty building awaiting news of relatives. Markham's initial telegram to the Admiralty had only named the 22 officers who had drowned, and further details were slow to arrive. Many immediately laid blame on Tryon, as the obvious \"scapegoat\".Hough pp. 109\u2013111. Later, as more information reached England, more considered questions arose as to how experienced officers could have carried out such dangerous orders.Gordon p. 261.
