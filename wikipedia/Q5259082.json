However, due to the hostilities, he had to wait until 1946 before he made his debut for the club in a competitive game. During the war years, Wright served in the British Army, and was stationed in Northern Ireland most of that time. He guested for Glenavon during the war, and also turned out for Nottingham Forest during the wartime competition.After the war had ended, he returned to Mansfield, and made his debut on 12 October 1946 against Leyton Orient. He remained Mansfield's first-choice goalkeeper for the next decade, and played a total of 399 first-team matches for the club, which was a club record at the time of his retirement from the game in 1957. He died in 1993, aged 73.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1946\u201347 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1951\u201352 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}, {"page": "1956\u201357 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Dennis Wright"]}]}}
