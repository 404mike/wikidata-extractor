He was their top goalscorer over each of the next three seasons, scoring more than 20 goals each season, making him the first player to achieve this feat for over 50 years. These goals helped Hibs win the Scottish Cup in 2016 and promotion in 2017.\nHe moved to Nottingham Forest in June 2017, but has not played regularly for their first team. Cummings was loaned to Rangers in January 2018, Peterborough United in July 2018 and Luton Town in January 2019. He made his first full international appearance for Scotland in November 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sam Ricketts", "response": ["In the summer of 2019, Ricketts made more notable signings to strengthen the squad for the upcoming 2019\u201320 season, bringing in players such as Jason Cummings from Nottingham Forest, Sean Goss from Queens Park Rangers, Donald Love from Sunderland, Ethan Ebanks-Landell from Wolves and Aaron Pierre from Northampton Town. Ricketts started the season with a 1\u20130 win at home to Portsmouth on 4 August, with loanee Ryan Giles scoring the goal. During the 2019\u201320 season, Ricketts lead the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup for the second time during his management spell, defeating Bradford City, Mansfield Town and Bristol City along the way. The fourth round would see Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side host Premier League leaders and European and World champions Liverpool, where Shrewsbury came from 0\u20132 down to draw 2\u20132 with 2 goals from substitute Jason Cummings, forcing a replay at Anfield. In the replay, Shrewsbury fell short after a Shaun Whalley goal was disallowed by VAR for offside and an own goal from Ro-Shaun Williams saw the hosts win 1\u20130. This cup run brought repercussions, however, as Ricketts and the club went 10 league games without a win between December 2019 and February 2020. A 2\u20130 home defeat to Accrington Stanley on 11 February 2020 followed by another 2\u20130 defeat away at Portsmouth on 15 February put Ricketts' job under severe pressure. The winless run ended a week later on 22 February after a 1\u20130 win at home to Doncaster Rovers. On 14 March 2020, Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side were scheduled to take on top-of-the-table Coventry City at St Andrew's, however the match was postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Due to the pandemic, the 2019\u201320 League One season was cut short and it was decided that final league positions would be based on a points-per-game basis. This saw the club finish 15th in the final table."]}, {"page": "Paul Heffernan", "response": ["While warming up ahead of a match against Aberdeen, Heffernan sustained a groin injury, which ruled him out for the remainder of the season. Unexpectedly, Heffernan made his return in the last game of the season against his former club, Kilmarnock, which they lost and condemned the club in the play-offs. In the play-offs against second place Hamilton Academical, Heffernan set up a goal for Jason Cummings, who scored twice in the match, as Hibernian won, 2\u20130, in the first leg, which meant Hibernian might retain their Scottish Premiership status. However, Hamilton catch up the same scoreline in the second leg and the draw resulted in extra time and still on until it went to penalty shoot-out. However, Hibernian lost and were relegated to the Scottish Championship."]}, {"page": "Tynecastle High School", "response": ["* Jason Cummings, professional footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Rangers F.C. international footballers", "response": ["| Jason Cummings ||align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"| 27 March 2018 ||align=\"center\"|1"]}]}}
