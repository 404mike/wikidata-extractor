They display the extraordinary range of his reading, covering authors as diverse as Gald\u00f3s, Goethe, H\u00f6lderlin, Cervantes, Marvell, Browning, Yeats, Gide, Rilke, Ronald Firbank, Nerval, Dashiell Hammett, Reverdy, Valle-Incl\u00e1n as well as figures more often found in his writings such as Eliot and Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez. The dates of composition of the essays range from 1935 to 1963, so they cover the full range of his critical career. For students of Cernuda, the main interest lies in the first volume. Not only does it contain his heartfelt 1946 tribute to Andr\u0117 Gide but also \"Palabras antes de una Lectura\" and \"Historial de un Libro\", two of the most revealing accounts of his poetics and starting-points for all Cernuda criticism. \"Palabras\" was the text of a lecture delivered at the Lyceum Club in Madrid in 1935 and edited for publication in 1941. He begins by discussing the purpose of poetry, which for him is a question of conveying his personal experience of the world. It is in this lecture that he reveals his primary theme: reality versus desire. His aim is to find \"a transcendental plane of existence where the division between the objective and the subjective dimensions of the world is eliminated\"Harris: Luis Cernuda a study p 62 and cosmic harmony can be attained. He makes a clear distinction between the world's deceptive appearance and the hidden \"imagen completa del mundo\",Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Palabras antes p 602 which is the true reality. He also develops the idea of a \"daimonic power\" that pervades the universe and is able to achieve this synthesis of the invisible underlying reality and its deceiving appearance. But a force powerful enough to do this is also capable of destroying the poet, as in the case of H\u00f6lderlin.Cernuda: OCP vol 1 Palabras antes p 605 The \"Historial\" was first published in instalments in M\u00e9xico en la Cultura in 1958. It is a detailed account of Cernuda's intellectual development and gives great insight into the process of how he became a poet and how his poetry evolved over time. In a review in the Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, Arthur Terry described it as \"the most remarkable piece of self-analysis by any Spanish poet, living or dead\". It is, however, very reticent about his emotional development. For example, he only alludes very obliquely to the love affairs that inspired Los placeres prohibidos, Donde habite el olvido and \"Poemas para un cuerpo\"."]}, {"page": "Trinity Hall, Cambridge", "response": ["* Ronald Firbank \u2013 Novelist"]}, {"page": "1916 in literature", "response": ["*Ronald Firbank \u2013 Inclinations "]}, {"page": "1915 in literature", "response": ["*Ronald Firbank \u2013 Vainglory"]}, {"page": "1919 in literature", "response": ["*Ronald Firbank \u2013 Valmouth"]}, {"page": "1926 in literature", "response": ["*Ronald Firbank \u2013 Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli", "*May 21 \u2013 Ronald Firbank, English novelist (born 1886)"]}, {"page": "Sandy Wilson", "response": ["Wilson wrote the musical Valmouth in 1958, based on a Ronald Firbank novel set in a seaside resort.

Within a very few years, however, coteries of readers began to discover a common interest in his work, and a resilient literary cult began to form.  In 1934 A. J. A. Symons published The Quest for Corvo, one of the century's iconic biographies, and this brought Rolfe's life and work to the attention of a wider public. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a further surge of interest in him which became known as \"the Corvo revival\", including a successful adaptation of Hadrian for the London stage. Two biographies of Rolfe appeared in the 1970s. These led to his inclusion in all the major works of reference and engendered a stream of academic theses on him. Although his books have remained in print, no substantial monograph has ever appeared in English on his work.There is one work in Italian: Carla Marengo Vaglio, Frederick Rolfe Baron Corvo, Mursia, 1969. With the growing academic interest in the history of literary modernism and acknowledgement of the central importance of life writing in its genesis, the true importance of Rolfe\u2019s autobiographical fictions has come into focus.  His influence has been discerned in novels written by Henry Harland, Ronald Firbank,See David Dougill, 'Firbank: A Long Look', in Books and Bookmen, Vol 18, May 1973, p.36. Dougill appends to his article a short bibliography of the evidence for the influence of Rolfe on Firbank. Graham Greene,Greene's biographer claimed that Pinkie, the protagonist in \"Brighton Rock\", was based on Rolfe.
