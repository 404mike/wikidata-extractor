He read for the Bar and was called (Lincoln's Inn) in 1937. He joined the Territorial Army in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and during the Second World War served in Italy and Greece as well as at the Staff College. He ended the war with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.\nHe was demobilized early as a Parliamentary candidate, fighting South Ayrshire for the Conservative Party in the 1945 general election. He fought the same seat in a 1946 byelection, having in the meantime been elected to Chelsea Borough Council for Hans Town ward. He fought Rochester and Chatham in the elections of 1950 and 1951, a potentially winnable seat.\nMathew was chosen for the safe seat of Honiton and won it in the 1955 general election. Derek Walker-Smith, who served as Minister for Health, picked him as his Parliamentary Private Secretary from 1957 to 1960 and also in 1964. Although a backbencher, Mathew's views were regarded as important; his strong support for British membership of the European Economic Community when the Macmillan government applied for membership did much to solidify Conservative opinion.\nMathew died in his sleep in December 1966 at the early age of 55.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "response": ["|Robert Mathew"]}, {"page": "Mathew", "response": ["* Robert Mathew (1911\u20131966), British Barrister and politician"]}, {"page": "Robert Mathews", "response": ["Robert Mathews may refer to:", "* Robert Mathew (1911\u20131966), British barrister and politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Robert Mathew"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Robert Mathew"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Robert Mathew"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Robert Mathew"]}, {"page": "Conservative government, 1957\u20131964", "response": ["|Robert Mathew||30 January 1964 \u2013 16 October 1964||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Robert Mathew"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Robert Mathew"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Robert Mathew"]}, {"page": "1967 Honiton by-election", "response": ["The seat had become vacant when the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Robert Mathew had died on 8 December 1966.

The newspaper said in an article titled \"Man with his own country\" that John Allen Kuchar Zegrus claimed to be \"a naturalized Ethiopian and an intelligence agent for Colonel Nasser\", and carried a passport \"issued at Tamanrasset, the capital of Tuared south of the Sahara\". Tuared is likely Tuareg misspelled, and Tamanrasset is an actual province in Algeria. A text in \"Tuared language\" written with Latin characters was also cited by the newspaper. Earlier on 29 July 1960, the story in this form was mentioned in the British House of Commons, it was cited by Robert Mathew as an argument that \"passports are not very good security checks\"."]}]}}
