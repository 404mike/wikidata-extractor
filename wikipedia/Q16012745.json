The new building was designed by Sir John Brown, A E Henson and Partners and was officially opened by the local member of parliament, Joyce Butler, as Wood Green Civic Centre on 15 March 1958. The design, which was influenced by Aarhus City Hall and S\u00f8ller\u00f8d Town Hall, both in Denmark, envisaged a public area in the southern part of the building and workspace for council officers and their departments in the northern part of the building. It involved an asymmetrical main frontage facing onto High Road; the southern section featured a large projecting glass frontage with a doorway on the ground floor while the northern section of the frontage comprised nine bays with windows on each of the ground, first and second floors. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber behind the glass frontage on the first floor and the mayor's parlour in the west wing of the building. The council chamber was designed with an unusual suspended ceiling which sloped down to the back of dais on which the mayor sat."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Joyce Butler"]}]}}
