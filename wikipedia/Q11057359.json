His county cricket career was spent with Worcestershire, with whom Flavell won two County Championship titles. His new ball bowling partnership with Len Coldwell was one of the most feared and respected in the 1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Trueman was selected for the first three Tests against Australia in 1964, was omitted from the fourth and then recalled for the fifth in which he became the first bowler to capture 300 Test wickets. England again failed to recover the Ashes in a generally disappointing 1964 series which is only memorable for Trueman's unprecedented feat. On 15 August 1964, he reached the milestone when he had Neil Hawke caught by Colin Cowdrey at slip in the fifth Test at the Oval. Hawke, a good friend of Trueman off the field, was the first to congratulate him. The occasion produced one of Trueman's few concessions to fatigue when he was asked if he thought his record would ever be broken and he quipped: \"Aye, but whoever does it will be bloody tired\". As Warr pointed out: \"This comment reveals the essence of the man. A touch of belligerence, a hint of humility, a pinch of roughness and an over-riding sense of humour\". Meanwhile, Yorkshire lost the County Championship title which was won for the first time by a very strong Worcestershire team which starred Tom Graveney and featured Basil D'Oliveira, Norman Gifford and fast bowlers Len Coldwell and Jack Flavell. Trueman's overall achievements in 1964 did not meet his own high standards and his tally of exactly 100 wickets was well down on his totals in recent seasons."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Jack Flavell"]}, {"page": "2004 in cricket", "response": ["*5 March \u2014 Jack Flavell, Worcestershire and England fast bowler"]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Their first period of great success came in the 1960s under the Presidency of Sir George Dowty and the captaincy of Don Kenyon, when the county won two County Championships thanks to the achievements of such players as Norman Gifford, Tom Graveney, Jack Flavell, Len Coldwell and Basil D'Oliveira. They were also losing finalist in the first ever Gillette Cup Final in 1963 - the inaugural limited overs knockout competition in England. In 1971 Worcestershire won their first ever Sunday League title thanks largely to the bowling of Vanburn Holder and the New Zealander Glenn Turner was instrumental in Worcestershire's third championship win in 1974. In the 1980s, the prodigious batting feats of Graeme Hick and the arrival of Ian Botham paved the way for two more county titles in 1988 and 1989 - the same year in which they beat the touring Australians inside two days.

Taller than many wicket-keepers of the period, he seemed well-equipped to handle Worcestershire's battery of fast-medium bowlers in the late 1950s, led by Jack Flavell and Len Coldwell. But the emergence from 1960 of a more balanced bowling attack, with the arrival of first Doug Slade and then Norman Gifford, both slow left-arm, not only gave Worcestershire a Championship-winning edge but also showed Booth to be among the best all-round wicket-keepers in the country at the time. Despite his record, he appears never to have been close to Test selection, as the long-standing Godfrey Evans was succeeded as England wicketkeeper by a series of players (Roy Swetman, John Murray, Geoff Millman, Jim Parks) a few years younger than Booth."]}, {"page": "John Aldridge (cricketer)", "response": ["Aldridge debuted for Worcestershire during the 1956 season, in a game against Sussex, and took two wickets with his bowling in the first innings.
