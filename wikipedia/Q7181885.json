He lost his seat at the 2016 election. He represented Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Assembly constituency) and was the Sinn F\u00e9in party spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Investment.\nFlanagan also served as a councillor on Fermanagh District Council following his co-option in 2009  and re-election in May 2011. He resigned from his council seat in August 2011 in line with Sinn F\u00e9in party policy on dual mandates and was subsequently replaced on the council by Stephen Huggett. Flanagan originally from Garrison, County Fermanagh, lives in Tempo. Educated at St Michael's College, Enniskillen, he is a former retail manager and small-business owner.In references to the Se\u00e1n Quinn case, Flanagan stated that, \"It is not up to the media, to politicians or to anyone else to determine the outcome of this case. That decision needs to be made by a judge and the sooner that happens and a clear outcome is decided, the better it will be for all concerned.\"In December 2015 it was announced that Mr Flanagan would not run in the May 2016 Assembly elections when he failed to gain the necessary support from delegates at a Fermanagh South Tyrone constituency selection convention. In January 2016, at a re-convened selection convention, he was put back on the party ticket at the expense of Michelle Gildernew. In February 2016 Sinn F\u00e9in decided to run an extra candidate in Fermanagh South Tyrone and the extremely popular Gildernew was added back on to party ticket.During the Assembly election on 5 May 2016 Mr Flanagan polled 3,449 first preference votes, lost his seat and was the first Sinn F\u00e9in candidate to be eliminated from the count.After stepping away from politics after losing his MLA seat in 2016 Mr Flanagan became the Vice Chair of the County Fermanagh GAA Board in December 2016. In June 2018 Mr Flanagan was awarded over five thousand pounds in damages when he was discriminated against by Citizens Advice on grounds of his political opinion.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Michael's College, Enniskillen", "response": ["*Phil Flanagan, Sinn F\u00e9in Fermanagh and South Tyrone MLA"]}, {"page": "Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=4|Phil Flanagan(Sinn F\u00e9in)"]}, {"page": "2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election", "response": ["|Gerry McHugh (retiring)|| style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|SDLPInd.
