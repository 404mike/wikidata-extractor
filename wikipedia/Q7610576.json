He usually played at centre-half, but was often deployed at wing-half throughout his career. Born in the town of Burnley, he initially played as an amateur in local league football before a move to hometown club Burnley in 1925. He spent four seasons in the Football League First Division with the club before moving to nearby Third Division North outfit Nelson in the summer of 1929. A transfer to Doncaster Rovers followed a year later. In 1932 he joined York City and later returned to Lancashire for a spell at Rochdale, before ending his career in non-league football with Burton Town.", "link_mentions": {}}}
