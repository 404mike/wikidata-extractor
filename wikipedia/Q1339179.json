Noting that \"there wasn't time for everything\", the producers cut completely the scene in the Temple of Bel-Shamharoth and the associated plotline about the significance of the number eight; Director Vadim Jean defended the decision, saying \"we could have gone there, but we went to the Wyrmberg instead. There [were] time constraints and we could have gone one way or the other, so we went the whole hog on just one.\" The scenes in the Wyrmberg were themselves shortened and simplified, reducing the character of Li!ort to a cameo and losing the characters of K!sdra, Greicha and Hrun completely.", "The adaptation was produced by The Mob,  with Rod Brown, Ian Sharples, Elaine Pyke and Sarah Conroy credited as producers.

After the success of Hogfather, Pratchett was easily persuaded to release the rights for The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. Vadim Jean was employed to adapt the two literary works into a three-hour, two-part screenplay.  While Pratchett was given \"carte blanche\" to \"turn up whenever [he] wanted\", he was happy to see a more liberal interpretation of his first two works than he had been for Hogfather. Speaking to Sky Magazine, Pratchett said that, \"There [was] not so much emotional baggage... riding on The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. It was just this book of mine that suddenly started selling incredibly well\". Jean's main challenge was to streamline the plot and remove the many tangents that are a feature of Pratchett's work, without destroying the appeal of the books.  Jean said that \"there [was] a real danger, with this story, that one could strip out the 'Pratchett-ness'... I had to fight to keep [it] in\". Pratchett was pleased with the final script, saying \"it wasn't the slaughter job I thought it would have to be\", and \"[we've managed] to keep the soul... it's still recognisably [the same] book\"."]}, {"page": "One More Kiss (film)", "response": ["One More Kiss is a Scottish romantic drama directed by Vadim Jean, starring Valerie Edmond, Gerard Butler and James Cosmo.
