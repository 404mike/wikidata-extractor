J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye had taken on great personal significance for Chapman, to the extent that he wished to model his life after the novel's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. One of the novel's main themes is Caulfield's rage against adult hypocrisy and \"phonies\". Chapman claimed that he had been enraged by Lennon's infamous, much-publicised remark in 1966 that the Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus\", and by the lyrics of Lennon's songs \"God\", where Lennon states that he does not believe in God or Jesus, and \"Imagine\", where Lennon altruistically states \"imagine no possessions\", yet had a lavish lifestyle as depicted in Anthony Fawcett's 1976 book John Lennon: One Day at a Time, making Lennon a \"phony\"."]}, {"page": "List of Old Abingdonians", "response": ["* Anthony Fawcett (born 1948), writer, art critic, and a former personal assistant to John Lennon"]}, {"page": "Henry Diltz", "response": ["Diltz contributed all the photographs to the 1978 book California Rock, California Sound, which archived the Los Angeles music scene of the 1970s.
