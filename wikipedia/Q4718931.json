Gauge attended school in California before moving to England. He served in the British Army in India during World War II, where he became acquainted with John Masters. He first appeared on the New York stage in 1945. He acted in many of Shakespeare's plays, and usually played villains in British films, but many considered his forte to be comedy. He was a great hit in the London stage production of The Seven Year Itch.Gauge appeared in the films The Interrupted Journey in 1949, and, all in 1952, Murder in the Cathedral, Mother Riley Meets the Vampire, with Old Mother Riley and B\u00e9la Lugosi, and was the flirtatious Tracy Tupman in The Pickwick Papers. He also appeared in the films Martin Luther (1953), Beau Brummell (1954), The Green Man (1956) and The Iron Petticoat (1956) starring Bob Hope. In 1955 he joined the cast of both The Scarlet Pimpernel (as George, the Prince Regent) and The Adventures of Robin Hood, as Friar Tuck, a role he played until 1960. In 1959 Gauge starred as Brigadier Wellington-Bull in the series The Adventures of Brigadier Wellington-Bull alongside Valerie Singleton.\nIn 1960, just weeks before his death, he played the Duke of Norfolk in the original West End production of A Man for All Seasons at the Globe Theatre. His last performance was a posthumous appearance in the 1961 film Nothing Barred starring Brian Rix.\nGauge  married Phyllis Anne Young in Penzance in 1957. He died aged 46 in Woking in Surrey in 1960. Originally, he was thought to have died from an overdose, however, it was later ascertained that he died of natural causes. His death certificate, issued by the General Register Office for England and Wales, lists the cause of death as a malignant brain tumour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Johann Tetzel", "response": ["*Alexander Gauge in the 1953 film Martin Luther."]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)", "response": ["* Friar Tuck, a member of Robin Hood's band.

The Becket controversy also forms the basis for T. S. Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral, where the tensions between Henry and Becket allow a discussion of the more superficial events of Becket's death and Eliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode.
