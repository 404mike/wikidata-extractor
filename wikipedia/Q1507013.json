The motorcycles were dubbed the \"Rolls-Royce of Motorcycles\" by H. D. Teague of The Motor Cycle newspaper. Approximately 3048 motorcycles (19 models) were made in the 21\u00a0years of production; around a third of that production still exists. T. E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\") owned eight of these motorcycles and died from injuries sustained when he crashed number seven; the eighth was on order. Moving forward to 2008, vintage motorcycle enthusiast Mark Upham acquired the rights to the Brough Superior name. In 2013 he met motorcycle designer Thierry Henriette and asked him to design a new Brough Superior motorcycle. Three months later a prototype of a new SS100 was shown in Milan.", "George Brough was a racer, designer, and showman - his father William E. Brough had been making Brough Motorcycles in Nottingham since 1908, and continued to do so until 1926. Convinced he could improve on his father's designs, all Brough Superior motorcycles were high performance and superior quality. Most were custom-built to the customer's needs, and rarely were any two of the same configuration.", "Each motorcycle was assembled twice. The first assembly was to fit all the components. Then the motorcycle was disassembled and all the parts painted or plated as needed. Finally, the finished parts were assembled a second time. Every motorcycle was test ridden to ensure that it performed to specification, and was personally certified by George Brough. The SS100 model was ridden at  or more before delivery. The SS80 model was ridden at  or more before delivery. If any motorcycle did not meet specification, it was returned to the works for rework until it performed properly. The fit and finish was comparable to a Rolls-Royce car, and they were the most expensive road-going motorcycles in the world.", "*Golden Dream. This was powered by a vertically stacked twin crankshaft opposed four cylinder engine. George Brough called this a \"flat vertical\" engine, which used a shaft final drive. The bike was finished in gold paint for the London Motorcycle Show. It was unveiled at the motorcycle show at Earls Court in 1938.", "*Brough Superior Austin Four or BS4. This bike was powered by a modified Austin 7 automobile engine and transmission.  As the prop-shaft of the automotive transmission emerged in the center of the motorcycle's driveline, George Brough used two rear wheels mounted to a central, cast final drive unit.  As the rear wheels were within 24\" of each other, the Brough Superior 3-wheeler was legally considered a 'motorcycle' in the UK.  It remains the only motorcycle in history to use this configuration.  The Brough-Austin Four was intended for sidecar use, although one was ordered without a sidecar by journalist Hubert Chantry, who had borrowed a factory show model for use in the Land's End Trial of 1932. 10 examples were built.", "George Brough was known for his dedication to his vehicles and customers. He, and later Albert Wallis, continued to service  Brough Superiors after production ceased, making parts until 1969.

Built between 1935 and 1939, they were powered by Hudson engines and had a Hudson chassis. Three models were made, but only two reached production. Early cars did not carry Brough Superior badges as Brough thought the cars sufficiently distinctive in themselves.", "The Brough surname, as with many English surnames that look like placenames, probably arose because one of George Brough's male-line ancestors came from one of several places in Britain so called.
