Old Gibraltarian school friends Paul Isola, Danny Felice, and Stuart Cavilla met up in London and became informally known as the Gibraltarian Mafia. When, in late April 1996, this circle of friends formed a band, they wanted a name to reflect their joint origins and called themselves simply Breed. The band were forced to change their name because it was previously registered by Steve Hewitt (formerly of Placebo) on his vanity record label. Stuart Cavilla, the band's bass player, had previously worked as a motorcycle courier under the call sign of Kilo 77 or K77, and the band became Breed 77.", "On 28 August 2013, lead vocalist Paul Isola announced his departure from the band due to personal circumstances, detailing that he would not be participating in the band's upcoming summer tour.

R\u00edo Tinto is a river which carries blood red waters due to its high mineral content, which provided the video with striking visuals. The famous sand dunes of Tarifa provides the video with a desert-like background, giving it a sense of scorching heat which is felt throughout the video. The Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque at Europa Point in Gibraltar can be clearly seen in the background as the band is seen playing their music and displaying a flag of Gibraltar as they do on stage at their concerts.
