He took a 1st class degree in geology at the University of Sheffield in 1955 and then proceeded to research for a PhD. However, notwithstanding declining to submit his thesis for examination, his outstanding qualities were recognised by the Professor of Geology at Reading University, another, but unrelated Professor Percival Allen, with the award of the Martin Lees Research Fellowship in 1958. So began a career at the University of Reading which continued to his retirement: appointment as lecturer in geology in 1961 was followed by promotion to Reader in 1967 and to a Personal Professorship of Geology in 1972 at the age of 39. In 1988 he was appointed Director of the newly formed Postgraduate Research Institute in Sedimentology. The flagship MSc trained many outstanding students, among whom are leading figures of the world's oil industry. Emeritus Professor since 2001, John continued to teach and be involved in the university until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Allen", "response": ["*John R. L.
