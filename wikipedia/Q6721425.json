She gained public notice playing Mrs.Buggins on the radio programme The Buggins Family, which ran from 1928 to 1948. As well as writing the series, she started off playing the whole family as well.\nBorn in London, Mabel was one of the seven children of Richard Tilling, managing director of the Thomas Tilling bus company and Sophie (n\u00e9e Thorn).   She trained under Elsie Fogerty at the Central School of Speech Training, then based at the Royal Albert Hall, London, making her stage debut at the London Coliseum in 1929. She subsequently played a variety of roles in London and on tour, including Mrs. Bones in the light opera Derby Day at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in 1932, and Anne of Cleves in The Rose Without a Thorn at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1933.\nConstanduros became a radio celebrity after broadcasting her own sketches in 1925. She also wrote novels, short stories, and co-wrote 29 Acacia Avenue with her nephew Denis Constanduros. After World War II, she played Earthy Mangold in the popular Worzel Gummidge radio serial on the BBC Children's Hour.\nShe also starred in a pre-Archers serial, At the Luscombes, set in Cornwall, written by her nephew Dennis, and broadcast on the West Region of the BBC Home Service from 1948 until 1964.\nBarry Took wrote: \"although today her reputation has faded, she was a popular cultural figure between the wars, helping to establish the style and flavour of British radio comedy.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Hordern", "response": ["By the end of 1938 Hordern's father had sold the family home and had bought a cottage in Holt, near Bath, Somerset. The arrangement was convenient for the young actor, who used the premises as a base while he appeared in shows with the Rapier Players. One such piece was an adaption of Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm, which starred Mabel Constanduros, who had adapted the book with Gibbons's permission. Hordern was cast in the supporting role of Seth, a part he described as being fun to perform. The modernised script was \"adored\" by the cast, according to Hordern, but loathed by the audience who expected it to be exactly like the book."]}, {"page": "Worzel Gummidge", "response": ["The first broadcast with Worzel was before World War II on the BBC's Children's Hour.
