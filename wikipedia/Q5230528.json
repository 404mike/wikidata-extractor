The operation was codenamed PBJOINTLY, with the P and B standing for Peter and Bill respectively. Most of the manpower and funds were provided by the Americans, while the technical skills and experience from the Vienna tunnel came from Lunn's officers. Unknown to either the SIS or the CIA, the tunnel was revealed to the Soviets from the beginning by George Blake, who worked for SIS on the project. In the event, the KGB was quite happy to let the West snoop on the Red Army, and did not use the tapped lines for disinformation, as that could have led to Blake's exposure. A full account of the operation from a British perspective is given by espionage writer David A. T. Stafford in his book Spies Beneath Berlin (2002)."]}, {"page": "David A.T.

T. Stafford, writing in 1977, although supported with British intelligence and encouragement, the \"[i]nitiative came from the Yugoslavs, and only by a stretch of the imagination can the British be said to have planned or directed the coup d'etat.\" Radoje Kne\u017eevi\u0107 vehemently denied any British involvement at all in a series of published letters between himself and Stafford, until in 1979, Stafford apologised for his error and for any offence caused to Radoje Kne\u017eevi\u0107. In 1999, Ivo Tasovac criticised Stafford's revised conclusion, pointing to evidence that the plotters were dependent on British intelligence, and that senior British officials met with both Simovi\u0107 and Mirkovi\u0107 immediately before the coup was carried out. The British air attach\u00e9 Group Captain A.H.H.McDonald met with Simovi\u0107 on 26 March, and the assistant air attach\u00e9 and British intelligence agent T.G.Mappleback met with his close friend Mirkovi\u0107 on the same day and told him that the coup had to be carried out within the next 48 hours. According to the historian Marta Iaremko, writing in 2014, \"the vast majority of researchers\" consider that the putsch was planned with the assistance of the British intelligence services, but that this, and their encouragement of the revolt, were not sufficient to ensure it was carried out."]}, {"page": "David Stafford", "response": ["* David A.
