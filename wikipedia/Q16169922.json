Tull, who had collaborated with Madonna since her 2006 Confessions Tour, explained that the singer was a \"detail-oriented person\" and every scene in the backdrops had a creative meaning behind it. The first video showed themes including confinement, love, sex and violence among others, which changed in the backdrop for \"Bitch I'm Madonna\", where Tull wanted to create abstract imagery, superfluous color and dancing elements. The visual for \"Devil Pray\" showed drug intake, snakes, churches and crosses, interspersed with scenes of baptism and religious proceedings. In order to create the videos, Tull and his team discussed with Madonna at night since she was busy with rehearsals throughout the day. They aligned on the source of the images, any permission if required, usage of stock footage or creation of new graphics. The idea of using fan artwork during the performance of \"Rebel Heart\" emerged from this thought. Madonna's official website unveiled a contest where fans submitted their artwork related to the singer, with them displayed as a live digital gallery during the performance of \"Rebel Heart\". Several layering and rendering was done for most of the videos. Different multimedia software were used to create the clips, including Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Avid, as well as Final Cut Pro. For Tull, the challenge was to adapt each software based on the different videos they would create, including last minute changes and tweaks.", "In March 2016, Madonna announced that the Sydney, Australia shows of March 19\u201320, 2016 would be filmed for a tour DVD.
