He was a right-handed opening batsman.\nYoung played for Worcestershire from 1946 to 1948, then for Gloucestershire from 1949 to 1964. He scored 23,400 runs in his career with Gloucestershire, including 40 hundreds. His most prolific year came in 1959 when he managed 2090 runs. It was the second time that he had passed 2000 runs in a season, having also done so in 1955. In 1962 he put on 395 with Ronald Nicholls against Oxford University which remains the highest first-class opening stand by Gloucestershire; Young made his highest first-class score of 198.\nAfter his playing career ended he emigrated to South Africa, where he appeared regularly on radio as a cricket commentator.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Martin Young || 23,400"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Following the emigration of Sandy Singleton to Rhodesia after the 1946 season, Allan White succeeded him as Worcestershire captain. The team lacked batting strength and did well to improve their championship position. The outstanding player was Test all-rounder Dick Howorth who was, as in 1946, the first player to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with Peter Jackson who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player Roly Jenkins made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman Reg Perks took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper Hugo Yarnold who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, Eddie Cooper and, in his first full season, Don Kenyon all exceeded 1,000 runs. Worcestershire's best known batsmen at the time were Charles Palmer and the veteran Bob Wyatt and they were the first two in the county averages but neither played a full season. Laddie Outschoorn qualified for the championship for the first time and showed promise. Other players included Ronald Bird, Fred Cooper (brother of Eddie), Norman Whiting and Martin Young.Playfair, pp. 94\u201395."]}, {"page": "Ron Nicholls (English sportsman)", "response": ["In a game in 1962 against Oxford University he opening the batting with Martin Young and they put on 395 runs.

He was a freshman undergraduate at St Edmund Hall in 1962 and opened the bowling in the first match of the season against Gloucestershire: Martin Young and Ron Nicholls put on 395 for the first wicket for Gloucestershire, still the highest first-class partnership for any wicket for the county, though Martin did have Young caught behind the wicket. Playing in just six matches because of examinations, Martin took only nine first-class wickets in what Wisden Cricketers' Almanack declared was a \"depressing\" season. Four of those came in the University match, where he won his blue. He was a lot more successful in 1963, taking 26 first-class wickets including his first five-wicket haul, a return of six for 70 in the match against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) when his victims included four England Test batsmen. In the University match, however, he retired with influenza after bowling only five overs. In 1964, he missed the match with Cambridge entirely through injury, though earlier in the season, he had produced the best bowling figures of his first-class career by taking seven Derbyshire wickets for just 26 runs in a rain-ruined match."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Martin Young (1949\u20131964) : D.
