Just 15 minutes in a game against Queens Park Rangers, he snapped his Achilles tendon. This forced him out of the game for over a year and by the time of his return the West Ham team were in decline. The 1988\u201389 season saw him play only 20 league games without scoring as West Ham were relegated back to the Second Division. For the 1989\u201390 season manager John Lyall was replaced by Lou Macari who undertook the rebuilding of the West Ham side. Devonshire was rarely used making only seven league appearances that season. Macari was replaced in the same season by Billy Bonds who granted Devonshire a free transfer in May 1990. His last appearance for West Ham came on 14 February 1990 when he was a substitute for Gary Strodder in a 6\u20130 away defeat to Oldham Athletic in a League Cup semi-final. His performance, and that of other experienced West Ham players, Liam Brady, Phil Parkes, Alvin Martin and Julian Dicks, was described as \"embarrassingly helpless\" in a game known as the \"St. Valentine's Day massacre\".
