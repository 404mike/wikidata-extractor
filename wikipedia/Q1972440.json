In January 1950, Evans was tried, and was convicted of the murder of his daughter; he was executed by hanging on 9 March of the same year.\nDuring his trial, Evans accused his downstairs neighbour, John Christie, who was the chief prosecution witness, of committing the murders. \nThree years after Evans's execution, Christie was found to be a serial killer who had murdered several other women in the same house, including his own wife (Ethel). Christie was himself sentenced to death, and while awaiting execution, he confessed to murdering Mrs. Evans. An official inquiry concluded in 1966 that Christie had probably murdered Evans's daughter (Geraldine), and Evans was granted a posthumous pardon. The High Court dismissed proceedings to officially quash Evans's murder conviction in 2004 on the grounds of the cost and resources that would be involved, but acknowledged that Evans did not murder his wife or his daughter.\nThe case generated much controversy and is acknowledged to be a miscarriage of justice.
