He wrote extensively on topics related to Taiwan and was also responsible for founding the island's first school for the blind. Interested in the early history of the island (particularly the Dutch era), his knowledge of the time was such that he was called \"without doubt the greatest authority on this subject living\". He was probably the first European to see Sun-Moon Lake, which he named Lake Candidius in honour of the seventeenth century Dutch missionary George Candidius.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1921", "response": ["** William Campbell, British missionary in Taiwan (b. 1841)"]}, {"page": "George Leslie Mackay", "response": ["Mackay was described by Rev.

In July 1871, two native preachers were sent to the area after reports concerning the spread of Christianity in Po-li-sia were heard of in Taiwan-fu. They reported back that \"a movement, favourable to Christianity, had really taken place\" in the area. Members of the Canada Presbyterian Mission visited the area in March 1872.

He would later joke that he was chosen over Gibson for Formosa because of his longer legs, the better to navigate the hillier country in southern Taiwan. In 1885, after a year spent in Amoy learning the Amoy dialect under Douglas, Barclay moved to Taiwan-fu, the then capital of Qing-era Taiwan, where he was to spend the rest of his life in service to the church and the people of that city. He was the fifth missionary from the Presbyterian Church of England to be stationed in Taiwan-fu, after James Laidlaw Maxwell, Hugh Ritchie, William Campbell and Matthew Dickson. He was responsible for introducing the first newsletter in Taiwanese Hokkien, which was also the first printed newspaper in Taiwan in any language, the Taiwan Church News, printed using the Peh-oe-ji romanisation."]}]}}
