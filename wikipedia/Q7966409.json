He is known for his 1794 work A Specimen of a Commentary on Shakspeare. Specimen, which explored As You Like It in terms of John Locke's philosophy of associationism, has been described as the first work of literary criticism to use scientific psychology.In addition to his literary criticism, Whiter published his etymological research, first as Etymologicon Magnum in 1800, then as Etymologicon Universale in 1822 (vol. 1 and 2) and 1825 (vol. 3); August Baron Merian, a correspondent of Samuel Butler, stated that he \"pit(ied)\" Whiter, and described him as \"(a) great etymologist\u2014perhaps the greatest that ever lived. A genius certainly; but it seems, like most eminent\nartists, dissolute.\"Whiter's linguistic studies\u2014in particular, his research into the language used by Gypsies\u2014led him to be cited as a role model by George Borrow, to the extent that Whiter appears in Borrow's Lavengro as \"Reverend Whiter the philologist\". The book includes a song about his character, which goes as follows:\n\nFor several decades, Whiter's notes on the vocabulary of Romani were thought to have been lost, but were rediscovered and published in 1909 as Whiter's 'Lingua Cingariana'.", "link_mentions": {}}}
