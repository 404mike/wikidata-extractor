The featurette was written and directed by Oscar A. C. Lund, a native of Sweden, who also costarred in the three-reeler opposite Barbara Tennant as Lady Babbie. That role was loosely based on a popular character originally performed by American actress Maude Adams in the 1897 Broadway production The Little Minister, a play adapted from the 1891 novel of the same title by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie.\"The Little Minister\", 1897-1898, Internet Broadway Database (IBDB), The Broadway League, New York, N.Y. Retrieved February 14, 2020. Filming for this motion picture was done at Eclair's studio facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey and on location at Lake George, New York.\"Eclair Company At Lake George\", The Motion Picture News (New York, N.Y.), November 22, 1913, p. 30. Internet Archive. Retrieved February 12, 2020.", "The film's storyline was set in the colonial period of the United States in the early 1770s.Although film reviews and news items about Lady Babbie do not identify a specific British-ruled American colony for the story's setting, it could be surmised that it was either New York or Virginia, both of which were actually administered on separate occasions by a real Governor Dunmore in the early 1770s. Reviews and plot summaries of the featurette published in late 1913 and 1914 describe the portrayal of a romance set within a province marked by public opposition to the local government. The story involves Lord Primton (Frederick C. Truesdell), an important landowner who lives on his estate with his widowed sister (Julia Stewart) and her niece, Lady Babbie (Barbara Tennant). The nobleman despises a new, exorbitant tax levied on citizens by Governor Dunmore. To gather allies to discuss a plan of action against the tax, Primton invites his friends to a lawn party, hoping such a common social event will not arouse the suspicions of government officials. At the party a young British officer, Lieutenant Byron, meets Lady Babbie and falls immediately and deeply in love with the beautiful woman. Their obvious attraction for one another is resented by her fianc\u00e9, who is an army officer as well. Rising jealousies soon prompt the fianc\u00e9 to challenge Byron to a duel. When Babbie learns of the challenge, which is to take place at midnight at a nearby crossroads, she tries to stop it. She disguises herself in men's clothing, goes to Byron, and pleads with him not to fight. Her fianc\u00e9 finds them together again, becomes furious, and draws his sword. Byron counters with his own sword, and in the ensuing clash he kills the fellow officer.", "*Barbara Tennant as Lady Babbie", "Filming of Eclair's Lady Babbie was done in September and early October 1913, with interior scenes shot at the company's two-year-old studio facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey and most outdoor footage taken on location at Lake George, New York. Given that location's 200-mile distance from Fort Lee, Eclair sought to save production time and expenses by combining needed camerawork in a single outing and shooting scenes at Lake George for \"several scenarios\" or different upcoming films described to be \"English and Colonial in character\". Those films, according to a 1913 news item in The Motion Picture News, included scenes with Barbara Tennant, O. A. C. Lund, Julia Stewart, and various other  \"beautiful, quaintly gowned young women and handsome young men, garbed in costumes of bold sir knights and the scarlet coated uniforms of the English army in Colonial days.\""]}, {"page": "Thelma (1922 film)", "response": ["Thelma is a 1922 American silent drama film directed by Chester Bennett and starring Jane Novak, Barbara Tennant and Gordon Mullen.Munden p.213 It is based on the 1887 novel of the same title by the British writer Marie Corelli.", "* Barbara Tennant as Britta"]}, {"page": "Hidden Aces", "response": ["Hidden Aces is a 1927 American silent action film directed by Howard M.
