For his scientific works he is regarded as the \"father of transplantation\". He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as \"the wittiest of all scientific writers\", and Stephen Jay Gould as \"the cleverest man I have ever known\".Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Until he was partially disabled by a cerebral infarction, he was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill. With his doctoral student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert E. Billingham, he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance (the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules), which was theoretically predicted by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. This became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation. He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aristotle", "response": ["The Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by \"proceed[ing] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character\" on limited evidence from their senses.

The role of the immune system in transplant reject was proposed by Peter Medawar, whose skin graft transplants in world war two victims showed that skin transplants between individuals had much higher rejection rates than self-transplants within an individual, and that suppressing the immune system delayed skin transplant rejection.

Bullock, Alan et al. 1988. Fontana dictionary of modern thought. 2nd ed. Fontana, London. p. 293 came from his appreciation that mankind was in charge of its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need for a sense of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: \"The critical point in the evolution of man\u2026 was when he acquired the use of [language]\u2026 Man's development is potentially open\u2026 He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which\u2026 largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change.\"Huxley J.
