The fifth race of eight was billed as being for Formula One and Formula Two, but in truth like before, no Formula One car was in sight, and only seven cars came to the start (and some of them were sports cars). The race was planned for 30 laps but reduced to 20; John Coombs won in the Lea Francis engined Lotus Mk8 at 72.65 mph.

Their first win in a World Championship race using a recognised Formula One car was Stirling Moss's victory in Monaco 1960, driving the Rob Walker entered Lotus 18."]}, {"page": "Cooper T43", "response": ["| Dick Gibson", "| Dick Gibson", "| Equipe Prideaux/Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Dick Gibson, racing driver (b. 1918)"]}, {"page": "1960 VII South African Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2010", "response": ["*Dick Gibson, 92, English racing driver."]}, {"page": "1958 Caen Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Dick Gibson", "| Dick Gibson", "| Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "Cooper Grand Prix results", "response": ["| Dick Gibson", "|align=\"left\"|  Dick Gibson", "| Dick Gibson", "|align=\"left\"|  Dick Gibson", "| Equipe Prideaux/Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "Richard Gibson (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Dick Gibson (footballer) (1866\u20131943), Australian rules footballer", "* Dick Gibson (American football) (1900\u20131968), American football player", "* Dick Gibson (1918\u20132010), British racing driver"]}, {"page": "Dickie Gibson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "1960 Lombank Trophy", "response": ["| Equipe Prideaux / Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "1956 BARC Aintree 200", "response": ["|  Dick Gibson", "| Dick Gibson", "|  Dick Gibson", "|  Dick Gibson Bob Berry"]}, {"page": "1955 Avon Trophy", "response": ["|32|| Dick Gibson||Connaught-Lea-Francis||+12.4||12", "|32|| Dick Gibson||Connaught-Lea-Francis||53||"]}, {"page": "1958 New Zealand Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "1958 Lady Wigram Trophy", "response": ["|  Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "1959 Silver City Trophy", "response": ["| Dick Gibson", "|Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "1958 BRDC International Trophy", "response": ["| Dick Gibson", "|Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "1957 BRDC International Trophy", "response": ["| Dick Gibson", "|Dick Gibson", "| Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "1956 BRDC International Trophy", "response": ["| Dick Gibson", "|Dick Gibson"]}, {"page": "1960 VI South African Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Dick Gibson"]}]}}
