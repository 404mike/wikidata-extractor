When asked about what influenced her decision, she answered, \"I really didn't have any problems about my body. It wasn't ever an ambition. It was just one of those things\u2014if you are a certain height with a certain look and a certain pneumatic silhouette\u2014sooner or later in that sort of company it's a bit inevitable really\". She claimed that her comfort with posing nude was due to the liberating influence of her mother, Margaret Ayrton, a Witch. She said \"I suppose being brought up by hippies as parents, I had absolutely no problem being naked. The problems I had were actually wrestling with the whole sort of feminist thing. I tried to justify it to myself that there were loads of jobs that I thought were equally demeaning because they had such a low wage. When I waitressed, my take home pay was what I could earn in two hours modelling\". She attributes her buxom figure to a combination of rigorous ballet-training and having Irish and Welsh ancestry.Quoted in Playboy Playmate Six-Pack interview, 1992.", "*Playboy (USA) March 1987, vol. 34, iss. 3, pp.\u00a094\u2013107, by: Byron Newman, \"Playmate Of The Month: Great Briton\".
