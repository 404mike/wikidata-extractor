While in his senior year there, he formed his own orchestra, which debuted at the Royal Albert Hall a few months after he graduated. He then found work as an arranger and conductor for releases by Caravan, Barclay James Harvest, Bryan Ferry, Ginger Baker, Johnny Nash, Three Man Army, Japan and Elton John, as well as for the soundtrack for the film Tommy. He also played horn for the Spencer Davis Group early in the decade. He also recorded on his own as the Martyn Ford Orchestra; his 1976 album Smoovin featured Mike Moran, Ann Odell, Simon Phillips, Morris Pert, John Gustafson and Mel Collins. It also spawned a hit in the UK Singles Chart, \"Let Your Body Go Downtown\", which peaked at No. 38 in 1977. The song was written by Lynsey de Paul and Moran, who also wrote the follow-up single \"Going to a Disco\", which failed to reach the UK chart in the summer of 1977.\nIn the 1980s, he worked with Kate Bush, Phil Collins and Dave Davies, amongst others.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1986", "response": ["* Martyn Ford"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1982", "response": ["* Martyn Ford"]}, {"page": "Lynsey de Paul", "response": ["Together with Moran, de Paul subsequently wrote other songs, notably \"Let Your Body Go Downtown\" (1977) for the Martyn Ford Orchestra, a No. 38 UK chart hit that Ford and his Orchestra performed on Top of the Pops; and the follow-up non-album single \"Going to a Disco\", credited solely to Martyn Ford as well as the songs \"Without You\", and \"Now and Then\", which appeared on the albums Tigers and Fireflies and Just a Little Time, respectively.", "* 1977: \"Let Your Body Go Downtown\" (co-written with Mike Moran), no. 38 hit in the UK for Martyn Ford Orchestra"]}, {"page": "Face Value (album)", "response": ["* Strings on tracks 8 and 11 conducted by Martyn Ford"]}, {"page": "Never for Ever", "response": ["* The Martyn Ford Orchestra \u2013 strings (3, 6)"]}, {"page": "Blue Moves", "response": ["* The Martyn Ford Orchestra \u2013 strings (3, 7, 15), brass (7)"]}, {"page": "You Can't Hurry Love", "response": ["*Strings arranged by Martyn Ford"]}, {"page": "Five Miles Out", "response": ["* Martyn Ford \u2013 conductor on \"Five Miles Out\""]}, {"page": "Dancing in the Street", "response": ["* The Martyn Ford Orchestra \u2013 brass instruments"]}, {"page": "A Christmas Album (Amy Grant album)", "response": ["* The Martyn Ford Orchestra \u2013 strings (1, 2, 5\u201311), horns (2), woodwinds (2, 8, 10)"]}, {"page": "Quiet Life", "response": ["* Martyn Ford \u2013 orchestral conduction"]}, {"page": "Carolina County Ball", "response": ["* Mountain Fjord, M.D., & Martyn Ford - strings"]}, {"page": "Terrapin Station", "response": ["*The Martyn Ford Orchestra"]}, {"page": "Acting Very Strange", "response": ["* Martyn Ford \u2013 string arrangements and conductor"]}, {"page": "Jump Up!
