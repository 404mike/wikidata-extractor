Using this design, Crewe demonstrated the ability to image atoms using annular dark-field imaging. Crewe and coworkers at the University of Chicago developed the cold field electron emission source and built a STEM able to visualize single heavy atoms on thin carbon substrates.

Using this technique, he visualized individual heavy atoms on thin amorphous carbon films. In 2010 Krivanek and colleagues reported several technical improvements to the HAADF method, including a combination of aberration corrected electron optics and low accelerating voltage. The latter is crucial for imaging biological objects, as it allows to reduce damage by the beam and increase the image contrast for light atoms. As a result, single atom substitutions in a boron nitride monolayer could be imaged."]}, {"page": "List of people from Bradford", "response": ["* Albert Crewe \u2013 (1927\u20132009) American physicist born in Bradford, inventor of the modern scanning transmission electron microscope."]}, {"page": "Crewe (surname)", "response": ["*Albert Crewe (1927\u20132009), physicist and inventor of the scanning transmission electron microscope"]}, {"page": "Peter Kalmus (physicist)", "response": ["1960 to 1964 \u2013 Kalmus worked for Argonne National Laboratory, USA, initially in the Particle Accelerator Division, directed by Albert Crewe. He was responsible for designing beam-transport equipment for the coming 12.5 Gev Zero Gradient Synchrotron. He transferred to the High Energy Physics Division and in 1961 went to CERN with an Argonne group headed by Art Roberts. It was at CERN that he first met John Dowell, and they designed and set up a particle beamline at the new 25 GeV Proton Synchrotron.  The Argonne group used this beamline to conduct a series of measurements of hyperon polarisation using a large optical spark chamber inside a magnetic field: a pioneering technique which much later became the basis of many other electronic imaging chambers.  On returning to Argonne in 1962 he collaborated with a Chicago group in an experiment on boson production, work which was finished during future visits to the USA as a visiting scientist at the University of Chicago."]}, {"page": "Norman Hilberry", "response": ["Hilberry became assistant director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1943.
