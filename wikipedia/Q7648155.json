The show, a fixed 10-week fill-in between the closure of the musical Charlie Girl and a new production of Show Boat, was produced by Harold Fielding, and consisted of two halves. Clodagh was due to feature in the opening half, mainly with the 30-strong singing and dancing group, The Young Generation, with two interspersed spots, one with comics Hope and Keen, the other some songs from Rodgers. The second half was a Tommy Steele-centred spectacular that had originally been played in Las Vegas. After cuts to the running order to trim the show's length, Rodgers and her manager/husband walked out 15 minutes before curtain-up on opening night. Hope and Keen filled in for her and after a few shows singer Susan Maughan took over her spot. Despite this, Rodgers continued with TV work through the late 1970s. As part of BBC1's celebration of the UK and Ireland both joining the European Economic Community on 1 January 1973, Clodagh appeared on Top Of The Year on 31 December 1972, alongside Bruce Forsyth and with Jimmy Tarbuck in The Tarbuck Follies on 1 January 1973 to see in the new year. Having been dropped by RCA in early 1974, Clodagh released just one single for the Pye label, \"Saturday Sunday\" later that year. She signed to Polydor Records in 1976. Despite extensive radio airplay and television appearances, her 1977 single \"Save Me\" failed to chart. The track was covered in the US by Louise Mandrell who took it to number six on the US country chart in 1983. \"Save Me\" was also covered by the South African all-female band Clout (an SA no. 7 hit in 1979). Other artists who covered this song include Merrilee Rush and Helen Reddy. The failure of the Polydor album or any of the singles issued from it to reach the UK charts led to the label dropping her in 1978."]}, {"page": "Consett", "response": ["*Susan Maughan (born 1938), singer, who reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1962 with \"Bobby's Girl\""]}, {"page": "Juke Box Jury", "response": ["In January 1967, the Sunday tabloid newspaper News of the World in a series of attacks on the new hippy sub-culture and LSD, castigated David Jacobs in one article for playing the Mothers of Invention single \"It Can't Happen Here\" on a Juke Box Jury broadcast in November 1966 as it was 'recorded on a trip', and also blamed two of the jury for voting it a hit.\"Pop Stars and Drugs \u2013 the facts that will shock you\", News of the World, 29 January 1967.
