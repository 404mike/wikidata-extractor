After the resignation of Chris Turner as Stockport County manager on Boxing Day 2005, Gannon was appointed as caretaker manager with the team nine points adrift of safety at the bottom of League Two, facing potential relegation from the Football League.", "County finished the 2007\u201308 season fourth in the league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2\u20131 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3\u20132 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself as one of the most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for \u00a3750,000 \u2013 a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous."]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 in English football", "response": ["18 December 1992 \u2013 Liverpool sign Norway defender Stig Inge Bj\u00f8rnebye from Rosenborg for \u00a3600,000.
