Upon meeting her personally, he was disappointed and turned his attentions towards Raquel Welch after seeing her on the cover of the October 1964 issue of Life. Welch was hired by Richard Zanuck of 20th Century Fox to appear in the film Fantastic Voyage the same year, instead. Faye Dunaway was also considered for the role and came close to signing for the part. Saltzman and Broccoli auditioned an extensive list of relatively unknown European actresses and models, including former Miss Italy Maria Grazia Buccella, Yvonne Monlaur of the Hammer horror films, and Gloria Paul. Eventually, former Miss France Claudine Auger was cast, and the script was rewritten to make her character French rather than Italian, although her lines were dubbed in the final cut by Nikki van der Zyl, who had voiced several previous Bond girls. Nevertheless, director Young cast her once again in his next film, Triple Cross (1966). One of the actresses who tried for Domino, Luciana Paluzzi, later accepted the role as the redheaded femme fatale assassin Fiona Kelly, who originally was intended by Maibaum to be Irish. The surname was changed to Volpe in co-ordination with Paluzzi's nationality."]}, {"page": "The Intelligence Men", "response": ["*Gloria Paul - Gina Carlotti"]}, {"page": "List of Western films of the 1960s", "response": ["|For a Few Dollars Less || Mario Mattoli || Lando Buzzanca, Raimondo Vianello, Gloria Paul || Italy || Spaghetti Western comedy"]}, {"page": "List of Italian films of 1966", "response": ["| For a Few Dollars Less || ||Lando Buzzanca, Elio Pandolfi, Gloria Paul ||Western||"]}, {"page": "List of British Italians", "response": ["* Gloria Paul"]}, {"page": "For a Few Dollars Less", "response": ["* Gloria Paul as Juanita"]}, {"page": "Psychopath (1968 film)", "response": ["* Gloria Paul as Nachtclubt\u00e4nzerin"]}, {"page": "Two Mafiosi Against Goldginger", "response": ["*Gloria Paul\tas \tMarlene"]}, {"page": "Veneri al sole", "response": ["*Gloria Paul as Jenny (segment \"Intrigo al mare\")"]}, {"page": "Tot\u00f2, Peppino e... la dolce vita", "response": ["*Gloria Paul: Patricia "]}, {"page": "Two Sons of Ringo", "response": ["* Gloria Paul as  Dorothy"]}, {"page": "Gloria (given name)", "response": ["* Gloria Paul (born 1940), Anglo-Italian actor and dancer"]}, {"page": "Fratelli d'Italia (1989 film)", "response": ["*Gloria Paul "]}, {"page": "The Three Fantastic Supermen", "response": ["* Gloria Paul as Havana"]}, {"page": "3 Supermen a Tokyo", "response": ["3 Supermen a Tokio did not have any of the original cast  outside Gloria Paul of the original film The Three Fantastic Supermen."]}, {"page": "1975 in Italian television", "response": ["* Macario uno e due - by Vito Molinari, with Erminio Macario and Gloria Paul."]}]}}
