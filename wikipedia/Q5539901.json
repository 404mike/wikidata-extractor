Vividly described scenes of grotesque and earthy incident (possibly too earthy for some modern tastes) follow one after the other in rapid succession.  As the literary historian George Gregory Smith wrote, \"Everybody is at fever-heat: the louder the women's voices and the harder the blows, the better the fun.\"  This forms a striking contrast with the aureate manner of the poet's contemporaries, the Scottish Chaucerians.  The exigencies of rhyme-scheme and alliteration that the poet faces are very rigorous, but he meets them with such inventiveness and apparent ease that it has been called a tour de force of mastery of technique."]}]}}
