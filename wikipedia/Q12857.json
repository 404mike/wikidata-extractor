His memoir, Born on a Blue Day (2006), is about his early life with Asperger syndrome and savant syndrome, and was named a \"Best Book for Young Adults\" in 2008 by the American Library Association's Young Adult Library Services magazine. His second book, Embracing the Wide Sky, was one of France's best-selling books of 2009. His third book, Thinking in Numbers, was published in 2012 by Hodder & Stoughton in the United Kingdom and in 2013 by Little, Brown and Company in the United States and Canada.\nIn 2016 he published his debut novel, Mishenka, in France and Canada. His books have been published in over 20 languages. He was elected in 2012 to serve as a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 31", "response": ["*1979 \u2013 Daniel Tammet, English author and educator"]}, {"page": "Herne Bay", "response": ["The actor and presenter Bob Holness lived in the town as a child and attended Herne Bay Primary School until moving to Ashford. Nicki Chapman, the judge on the UK television series Popstars and Pop Idol, was born and raised in the town. Originally from London, Daniel Tammet, the subject of the UK documentary The Boy with the Incredible Brain, has now moved to the town. He is an autistic savant with outstanding abilities in mathematics, sequence memorising and language learning. Lydia Cecilia Hill (1913\u20131940), known as Cissie Hill, lived at Westcliff; she was a favourite of Ibrahim of Johor and former dancer. The Yorkshire-born writer Will Scott lived and wrote in Herne Bay until his death in 1964. During the late 1960s, many successful rock and jazz bands were formed around the city of Canterbury, creating a subgenre of music known as the Canterbury sound. Some of these musicians were residents of Herne Bay, including Dave Sinclair and Richard Coughlan of Caravan, and Kevin Ayers of Soft Machine. George W. M. Reynolds, one of the most popular British authors of the early Victorian era, moved to Herne Bay in 1854 and became one of the town's Improvement Commissioners. The children's writer Evelyn Whitaker was born there in 1844. H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Ribeyro, the Mayor of Lima in Peru during the 1950s, had part of his schooling at the now defunct Herne Bay International school. Colin Dixon, the depot manager held hostage with his family during the \u00a353\u00a0million Securitas depot robbery of February 2006, lived in Herne Bay at the time."]}, {"page": "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat", "response": ["* \"The Twins\", about autistic savants. Dr. Sacks meets twin brothers who can neither read nor perform multiplication, yet are playing a \"game\" of finding very large prime numbers. While the twins were able to spontaneously generate these numbers, from six to twenty digits, Sacks had to resort to a book of prime numbers to join in with them. This was used in the 1993 film House of Cards starring Tommy Lee Jones. The twins also instantly count 111 dropped matches, simultaneously remarking that 111 is three 37s, an ability demonstrated by Dustin Hoffman's autistic character in the 1988 film Rain Man. This story has been questioned by Makoto Yamaguchi, who doubts that a book of large prime numbers could exist as described, and points out that reliable scientific reports only support approximate perception when rapidly counting large numbers of items. Autistic savant Daniel Tammet points out that the twins provided the matchbox and may have counted its contents beforehand, noting that he finds the value of 111 to be \"particularly beautiful and matchstick-like\"."]}, {"page": "Savant syndrome", "response": ["* Daniel Tammet, British author and polyglot"]}, {"page": "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two", "response": ["Cowan also noted a number of other limits of cognition that point to a \"magical number four\", and different from Miller, he argued that this correspondence is no coincidence. One other process that seems to be limited at about four elements is subitizing, the rapid enumeration of small numbers of objects. When a number of objects are flashed briefly, their number can be determined very quickly, at a glance, when the number does not exceed the subitizing limit, which is about four objects. Larger numbers of objects must be counted, which is a slower process. The film Rain Man portrayed an autistic savant, who was able to rapidly determine the number of toothpicks from an entire box spilled on the floor, apparently subitizing a much larger number than four objects. A similar feat was informally observed by neuropsychologist Oliver Sacks and reported in his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Therefore, one might suppose that this limit is an arbitrary limit imposed by our cognition rather than necessarily being a physical limit. (On the other hand, autism expert Daniel Tammet has suggested that the children Sacks observed may have pre-counted the matches in the box.) There is also evidence that even four chunks is a high estimate: Gobet and Clarkson conducted an experiment and found that over half of the memory recall conditions yielded only about two chunks. Research also shows that the size, rather than the number, of chunks that are stored in short-term memory is what allows for enhanced memory in individuals."]}, {"page": "List of Esperanto speakers", "response": ["* Daniel Tammet, British autistic savant.

Tammet points out the potential for problems in systems which have poorly defined means of pooling knowledge: Subject matter experts can be overruled and even wrongly punished by less knowledgeable persons in crowd sourced systems, citing a case of this on Wikipedia.  Furthermore, Tammet mentions the assessment of the accuracy of Wikipedia as described in a study mentioned in Nature in 2005, outlining several flaws in the study's methodology which included that the study made no distinction between minor errors and large errors."]}, {"page": "List of constructed languages", "response": ["| Daniel Tammet"]}, {"page": "Mnemonist", "response": ["Much of the evidence for innate superiority of memory is anecdotal and is therefore rejected by scientists who have moved toward accepting only reproducible studies as evidence for elite performance. There have been exceptions, however, that do not fit skilled memory theory as proposed by Chase and Ericsson. Synesthetes, for example, show a memory advantage for material that induces their synesthesia over a control group. This advantage tends to be in retention of new information rather than learning. However, synesthetes are likely to have some brain differences which give them an innate advantage when it comes to memory. Another group which may have some innate memory advantage are autistic savants. Unfortunately, many savants who have performed memory feats, such as Kim Peek and Daniel Tammet, have not been rigorously studied; they do claim not to need to use encoding strategies. A recent imaging study of savants found that there are activation differences between savants and typically developing individuals; these cannot be explained by the method of loci as mnemonic savants do not tend to use encoding strategies for their memory. Savants activated the right inferior occipital areas of their brain, whereas control participants activated the left parietal region which is generally associated with attentional processes.", "* Daniel Tammet"]}, {"page": "M\u00e4nti", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daniel Tammet#M\u00e4nti"]}, {"page": "List of people with epilepsy", "response": ["| Daniel Tammet"]}, {"page": "Manti", "response": ["* M\u00e4nti, a constructed language created by Daniel Tammet (born 1979)"]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: T\u2013V", "response": ["| Daniel Tammet"]}, {"page": "Daniel Paul Tammet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daniel Tammet"]}, {"page": "Ryan Cartwright", "response": ["He played Gary Bell, an autistic character, on the Syfy television series Alphas (2011\u20132012).
