She has referred to herself as \"an incredible mother, rather a good mistress, but not a very good wife\". With six children and five miscarriages, her primary vocation was motherhood, which prompted her to say: \"I'm not judgmental about women who work, but I was so besotted with my children I never wanted them out of my sight.\" She was also considered a mother figure by her nieces, Ladies Cosima and Sophia Vane-Tempest-Stewart, and Diana, Princess of Wales. As the wife and ex-wife of two unfaithful men, she explained her marriage philosophy to the Times in 1987: \"I can never understand the wives who really mind, the wives who set such store by fidelity. How extraordinary, and how mad they are. Because, surely, if the man goes out and he comes back, it's not actually doing any harm.\""]}, {"page": "Zac Goldsmith", "response": ["Goldsmith was born on 20 January 1975 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Chelsea, London.

Goldsmith has stated \"I was brought up by my father to identify very strongly as Jewish.\" He was raised at Ormeley Lodge in Ham with his siblings, Jemima and Ben. He is half-brother to Robin and India Jane Birley, his mother's children from her first marriage. As a child, he was an avid reader of naturalist Gerald Durrell's works and developed a committed passion for David Attenborough's wildlife documentaries. He later recalled, \"He was my hero, and it was his work that made me fall in love with the natural world\". His ecological interests were nurtured further when his father gave him a copy of Helena Norberg-Hodge's book Ancient Futures, with a note saying: \"This will change your life\"."]}, {"page": "Oswald Birley", "response": ["Birley's descendants include Robin Birley (born 1958), who married Lucy Ferry (1960\u20132018), and India Jane Birley (born 1961).
