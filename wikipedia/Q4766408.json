They included Meg and Kitty's brother, Andy Fraser (Ian Patterson), who marries motel secretary Ruth Bailey (Pamela Greenhall) in 1965; hotel chef Carlos Raphael (Anthony Morton), his wife Josefina (Gillian Betts), waitress Marilyn Gates (Sue Nicholls and later Nadine Hanwell) and kitchen assistant Amy Turtle (Ann George), later briefly arrested as a suspected Soviet spy, joined the series in 1965, as did postmistress Edith Tatum (Elisabeth Croft) and motel handyman Philip Winter (Malcolm Young). Long running character Diane Lawton (Susan Hanson) arrived in 1966. Other additions included Meg's close friend, former actress Tish Hope (Joy Andrews); suave manager and later motel director David Hunter (Ronald Allen); his first wife Rosemary (Janet Hargreaves); their son Chris (Freddie Foote and later Stephen Hoye); David's second wife Barbara (Sue Lloyd); chefs Gerald Lovejoy (William Avenell), Bernard Booth (David Lawton) and Shughie McFee (Angus Lennie); hairdresser Vera Downend (Zeph Gladstone); the Harvey family, consisting of father Wilf (Morris Parsons) and his grown children Stan (Edward Clayton and later Terry Molloy) and Sheila (Sonia Fox); accountant and later motel manager Adam Chance (Tony Adams); and cleaner Doris Luke (Kathy Staff). Perhaps the most memorable character proved to be the \"village idiot\" Benny Hawkins (Paul Henry), whose trademark was a woolly hat worn all year round. His fans included British troops serving in the Falklands War in 1982, who nicknamed the Falkland Islanders \"Bennies\" after the character.New Statesman, Volume 105, page 15 Instructed to stop using the name, the troops came up with \"Stills\" for locals - because they were \"still Bennies\".The New Yorker, Volume 69, Issues 36-39, page 87"]}, {"page": "Acorn Antiques", "response": ["*Mrs Overall (Julie Walters): the elderly tea lady, who believes all problems could be solved with a nice cup of tea, a macaroon and an anecdote. One of her many specialities is home-made sherry served in a mug. Her late husband referred to her as Boadicea. Asked why, she confesses, \"He was barmy, Miss Babs\". She is revealed to be the sole beneficiary of Berta's father's will, and mother of Miss Berta and Derek. The rather grand actress who \"plays\" Mrs Overall (Bo Beaumont) was a former lover of Lord Delfont. In the series she dies after choking on her own macaroon. According to Wood, the character of Mrs Overall was inspired by Mrs Mack in Take the High Road (overall being a deliberate pun on mac) and Amy Turtle in Crossroads (originally played by Ann George who was born in the same town that Walters spent her early years, Smethwick)."]}, {"page": "Amy Turtle", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ann George"]}, {"page": "Anne George", "response": ["*Ann George (1903\u20131989), British actress"]}, {"page": "List of longest-serving soap opera actors", "response": ["|Ann George || Amy Turtle || Crossroads || 1965\u20131976, 1987 ||  years ||"]}, {"page": "List of Crossroads characters", "response": ["|Ann George"]}]}}
