After a loan spell with Chester City in the closing stages of the 1983\u201384 season he then joined the club permanently. He then played for Rochdale (1985\u20131986), Preston North End (1986\u20131988) and Cambridge United (1988, loan), before joining Division Two side Blackburn Rovers in July 1988.\nHildersley made 30 league appearances for the Ewood Park club before moving to Wigan Athletic two years later, followed by a spell with Halifax Town. After their relegation out of the Football League in 1993, Hildersley returned to Scotland and played for East Fife and Montrose. He retired from playing after the 1997\u201398 season. In 1991, he played for Montreal Supra of the Canadian Soccer League. In 2000, he was working for J D Williams in Shaw nr Oldham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Preston North End F.C.", "response": ["The plan seemed to work, as North End, under new manager John McGrath, stormed to promotion in 1986\u201387 after finishing second in Division Four behind Northampton Town. The team's home form was superb as the opposition appeared to find it difficult to adapt to the new pitch, and McGrath's new recruits, journeymen such as Sam Allardyce, Oshor Williams, Gary Swann, Ronnie Hildersley and Les Chapman made them an extremely hard team to beat."]}, {"page": "Trevor Storton", "response": ["He served as Chester's caretaker-manager for a brief spell in 1983\u201384 but he quit the role at the start of 1984 after Ronnie Hildersley and Paul Sanderson were signed on loan from Manchester City without his knowledge. He left for Oswestry Town shortly after new manager John McGrath arrived. Storton's final game for Chester was a 3\u20130 home loss to Swindon Town in front of just 880 fans on 8 February 1984, a sorry end to his long association with the club."]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Ronnie Hildersley"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Ronnie Hildersley"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["|Ronnie Hildersley"]}]}}
