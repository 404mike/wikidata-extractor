The building was Grade B listed in 1954, which corresponds to Grade II and Grade II* in the modern scheme. In 1960 another young and socially innovative rector arrived in Woolwich, Nicolas Stacey. His \"Woolwich Project\" (1960\u201368) was controversial but brought new life to the church. Among the many changes, he had the aisles and galleries shut off with frosted glass panels to make a cafe and offices, before converting the crypt into a youth club. The \"Coffee House\" was opened by Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones in May 1961. Also, starting in 1965 (and ending in 2001), Stacey brought in the local Presbyterians to meet up with the Anglicans. In the 1970s the parish of St Mary Magdalene was merged into the three-church parish of Woolwich. Some restoration work was done in 1977, and in 2008 the gallery partitions were removed, restoring the spatial integrity of the building."]}, {"page": "Nick Stacey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicolas Stacey"]}, {"page": "L&Q", "response": ["The Quadrant Housing Association was formed in the London Borough of Greenwich in 1963 when 32 people invested \u00a32 each to create a housing association.
