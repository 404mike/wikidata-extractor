Its editor, John Scott, felt that Blackwood\u2019s hounding of Keats had contributed to his 1821 death, at age 26. Scott also felt it was his duty to defend his authors against Lockhart and Blackwood\u2019s. To that end, he published an attack of Lockhart and Blackwood\u2019s; Lockhart promptly asked a London friend, Jonathan Henry Christie, to visit Scott and demand an apology. Scott refused; a series of letters were exchanged and the argument evolved into Scott\u2019s insistence that Lockhart admit that he (Lockwood) was, in fact, the anonymous editor of Blackwood\u2019s (it was common practice at the time to act an editor, and/or as a writer, anonymously, or using a pseudonym). According to the papers of Scott\u2019s friend Peter George Patmore, who tried to negotiate a truce and kept a meticulous record of the matter, not only did Lockwood refuse to admit to his editorship, but he responded with \"abusive epithets\". With both men seeing their honour at stake, there was no going back and, on February 16, 1821, they proceeded with the duel. But Lockhart did not attend; Jonathan Christie stepped into his place with his friend, James Traill, as his second. John Scott was wounded and died ten days later. Christie and Traill were tried for murder. They were acquitted, but Christie\u2019s life was ruined. Lockhart was not blamed."]}, {"page": "Ode to a Nightingale", "response": ["John Scott, in an anonymous review for the September 1820 edition of The London Magazine, argued for the greatness of Keats's poetry as exemplified by poems including \"Ode to a Nightingale\":"]}, {"page": "John Scott", "response": ["John Scott may refer to:", "* John Scott (1639\u20131695), English clergyman and devotional writer", "* John Scott (sociologist) (born 1949), British sociologist", "* John Scott (engraver) (1774\u20131827), English engraver", "* John Scott (1849\u20131919), English artist", "* John Scott of Amwell (1730\u20131783), Quaker poet and friend of Samuel Johnson", "* John A.

As a result of its rise, the essay was the dominant and most marketable literary form for two decades at the beginning of the century. The template for quarterly periodicals was set by The Edinburgh Review, founded in Edinburgh in 1802 by four Whig lawyers with literary aspirations. Contributors were well paid and its paper covers, article lengths and formats, would be much copied. The most important rival was published by Tory William Blackwood, Walter Scott's publisher. It was known as Blackwood's Magazine, but was founded as the Edinburgh Monthly Magazine in 1817 and later shortened to Maga. Blackwood's inclusion of scathing literary reviews resulted in a large number of lawsuits that disrupted its publication, but ensured its literary reputation. The magazine entered into an acrimonious rivalry with the London Magazine, founded by Aberdeenian John Scott (1781\u20131821), that ended in a duel that resulted in Scott's death in 1821.D.
