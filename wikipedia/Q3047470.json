Members of the site also have, several times, worked closely together to root out deception and scams. In May 2001, MetaFilter played a key role in uncovering the Kaycee Nicole hoax, in which a woman made up a fake online persona of a teenage daughter who was dying of cancer, fooling many bloggers and garnering sympathy and gifts. In October 2004, MetaFilter members uncovered the identities of the writers of the hoax Website Nick Nolte's Diary. An astroturfing campaign by Holden Karnofsky, the co-founder of the online charity GiveWell, was detected in January 2008 through a sockpuppet posting to Ask MetaFilter, leading to Karnofsky's resignation. In 2009, a user detected photoshopping by photographer Edgar Martins in a New York Times Magazine gallery, which was subsequently withdrawn."]}, {"page": "Daylight (magazine)", "response": ["| Joel Sternfeld, David Maisel, Edgar Martins, Jeff Whetstone, and a Daylight project examining biodiesel production.
