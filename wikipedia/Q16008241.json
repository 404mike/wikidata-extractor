McPhail went straight into the starting eleven, and was ever-present as Lincoln won the 1931\u201332 Northern Section title. On Boxing Day 1933, he was sent off for striking the opposing centre-forward, Tom Nolan of Port Vale, who had barged into him while he was holding the ball. It transpired that the case was one of mistaken identity. The referee saw McPhail bent over the unconscious Nolan and assumed him to be to blame, but the offending blow had in fact been struck by Lincoln's Alf Young in an off-the-ball incident. In the next match, McPhail suffered a dislocated elbow, an injury that forced his absence from a competitive match for the first time since signing for the club. When he returned to action, he kept his place until near the end of the 1938\u201339 season, rarely missing a game. His final tally of 309 Football League appearances was at the time a club appearance record for players in any position, and the record for appearances by a goalkeeper lasted until 2007, when it was broken by Alan Marriott."]}, {"page": "Maidment", "response": ["*Jimmy Maidment (1901\u20131977), an English footballer"]}]}}
