In October 1922, a deputation of Southern Unionists met W. T. Cosgrave to offer their support to the Free State and some of them had received positions in the State's Upper house or Senate. Among the prominent senators whose homes were attacked were: Palmerstown House near Naas, which belonged to the Earl of Mayo, Moore Hall in Mayo, Horace Plunkett (who had helped to establish the rural co-operative schemes), and Senator Henry Guinness (which was unsuccessful). Also burned was Marlfield House in Clonmel, the home of Senator John Philip Bagwell, with its extensive library of historical documents. Bagwell was kidnapped and held in the Dublin Mountains, but later released when reprisals were threatened."]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["****Henry Guinness, grandson of Robert through Henry, Member of the Seanad \u00c9ireann"]}, {"page": "Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3", "response": ["In 1900, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 married Lucy Madeleine Guinness, a member of the banking branch of the Guinness family and a sister of Henry Guinness.
