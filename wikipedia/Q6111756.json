Three further players signed one-year contracts having impressed manager Paul Sturrock during an end of season trial match, these included former Ipswich Town defender Omar Sowunmi, ex-Queens Park Rangers midfielder Jordan Gibbons, and former Newport County forward Shaun Jeffers. Finally goalkeepers Chris Weale and Artur Krysiak both decided to remain at the club, the former becoming player-goalkeeper coach and the latter being removed from the transfer-list. On 14 July, Yeovil confirmed the signing of former Cambridge United striker Ryan Bird on a two-year contract. Yeovil's twelfth summer signing came in the form of former Portsmouth midfielder Wes Fogden who signed a two-year deal prior to the club's first pre-season friendly against Truro City on 17 July.", "Right back Connor Roberts extended his loan until the end of the season having been an ever-present in the side until that point, while Way signed young Everton midfielder Liam Walsh on a one-month loan deal.

Following that equaliser a brawl broke out between the two sets of players but despite Carlisle striker Jabo Ibehre \"clotheslining\" Yeovil keeper Artur Krysiak, the striker escaped with just a yellow card. With the game deep into injury time in the second half Yeovil earned a penalty but striker Fran\u00e7ois Zoko missed to send the game into extra time, the 30 minutes of extra time saw no further goals but two red cards with defender Alex Lacey receiving a red card for a studs-up tackle while Carlisle's Luke Joyce was dismissed for a second bookable offence.
