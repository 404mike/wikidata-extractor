There was a political truce between the parties of the wartime coalition government, and the seat was expected to be filled without a contest. However, the party nominated Edmund Broughton Barnard, chairman of the Metropolitan Water Board to oppose the government candidate, Edward Smallwood. A third candidate, A Baker, was supported by the right-wing MP Noel Pemberton Billing and the Vigilante Society. The party did poorly, Barnard finishing in a distant third place with 513 votes (10.8%). The party held its inaugural meeting two days later and the president, Lord Beresford, declared himself \"delighted\" with the result which \"would have the effect of putting more grit into those who were fighting\" for the party.", "* Hertford \u2014 Edmund Broughton Barnard (38.8%)"]}, {"page": "Kidderminster (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edmund Broughton Barnard \t"]}, {"page": "1928 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Edmund Broughton Barnard  Chairman of the Hertfordshire County Council and Lee Conservancy Board.
