Another controversial claim, that he fought in Java against the Muslims, has been analyzed by historians. The Dutch historian, P. A. Tiele, who wrote in 1880, did not believe Pinto was present during the campaign, but rather that he wrote his information from secondhand sources. Even so, Tiele admits Pinto's account cannot be disregarded because of the lack of alternative information about Javanese history during the time. Maurice Collis holds the opinion that Pinto's accounts, while not entirely true, remain compatible with historical events. Collis considers Pinto's work the most complete European account of 16th century Asian history."]}, {"page": "1973 in Ireland", "response": ["* 12 January \u2013 Maurice Collis, colonial administrator and writer (born 1889)."]}, {"page": "Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid", "response": ["She exhibited in London at Saint George's Gallery in 1948.

Freedman produced a stream of colourful posters and black-and-white drawings for press advertisements.  At Chromoworks he had total oversight of the production of the Lyons lithographs, a series of fine colour prints by British artists, which were displayed in the teashops of J. Lyons and Co., now regarded as a major achievement in bringing good art to 'the masses'. Among his last works were a series of lithographs, including a poster The Darts Champion, to promote the first Guinness Book of World Records published.
