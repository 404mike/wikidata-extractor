He remains continuously optimistic; even his being told to \"piss off\" by Victor is laughed off. Despite this run-in he later befriends Victor and they frequently chat in their gardens, where Victor is often surprised by Mr Swainey's activities, ranging from archery and preparing amateur dramatics props, to bizarre games he arranges for his bedridden senile mother, whom the audience never actually see. Despite his cheery demeanour, he does occasionally drop his guard, once displaying apparent depression at being nothing more than \"an overgrown boy-scout\". Following his mother's death, he moved house near the end of the series, but only went as far as the Trenches'/McVities' old house, claiming he'd always wanted to live in an \"end house, without leaving the area\".

In February 2015, Doctors sparked criticism after the word \"pussy\" was used in an episode. Due to the programme being transmitted in the daytime, the claims of \"offensive language\" led to an investigation by Ofcom, a broadcasting regulator. They were later cleared of any breaches of the code, with an Ofcom spokesperson stating: \"Following investigation, we found this BBC One soap didn't break our rules for offensive language before the watershed. The language used in the show was justified by the context it was presented in and aired at a time when children were unlikely to be watching.\" On 10 September 2015, Doctors aired its 3000th episode, \"The Heart of England\", which was extended and ran for 60 minutes.

The \"emotional and powerful\" homelessness week aired in May 2016. Script editor Nasreen Ahmed stated that lots of research went into the week, with researchers constantly finding new statistics and information.
