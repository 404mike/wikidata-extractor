He scored 57 goals in 256 league games during a six-year career in the English Football League.\nA former North Shields and Loughborough United player, he turned professional with Port Vale in 1967. He spent two years with the club, before joining York City for the 1969\u201370 season. Following this he spent three years with Colchester United, before moving to non-league Wimbledon in 1973, despite having been voted Colchester's player of the year and helping the club to win the Watney Cup. He made FA Cup history with the \"Dons\" in 1975, when he scored the winning goal to knock top-flight Burnley out of the competition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colchester United F.C.", "response": ["* Mick Mahon"]}, {"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["In preparation for the 1969\u201370 campaign he released Mick Cullerton, Mick Mahon, Jimmy Goodfellow, Graham Williams, and Milija Aleksic; whilst top-scorer Roy Chapman rejected a new contract and signed with Chester City. Despite this, the club's dire finances meant that he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic). Vale started the season with a club-record unbeaten 18 matches, and Lee began playing midfielder Tommy McLaren on a regular basis. Vale's financial situation was highlighted by the fact that they could not afford the \u00a3500 registration fee for Ian Buxton following the player's departure from Notts County. The \"Valiants\" were knocked off the top of the table following a bout of injuries, and Lee was forced to sign wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston. Speaking of their third-place finish, Lee said that \"no team could have deserved reward as much for their hard work and strength of character\"."]}, {"page": "Michael mahon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mick Mahon"]}]}}
