In 1800 Dundas, as Governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, engaged Symington to design a steam tug on the lines of a failed attempt by Captain John Schank for the Bridgewater Canal.

A brig of 60 tons, she carried a crew comprising the commanding officer, two mates and twelve seamen. His instructions were to proceed to Australia to prosecute \"the discovery and survey of the unknown parts of the coast of New Holland\", although it was always intended that he should hand the ship to Matthew Flinders and take command of HMS Supply. He sailed into Table Cape, South Africa on 8 July 1800. Here Grant received dispatches from the Duke of Portland advising him of the discovery of a strait between New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. He was to sail through it on his way to Port Jackson, instead of sailing around Van Diemen's Land. Thus his was the first ship to sail through Bass Strait from west to east, charting the then unknown coastline.

The sliding keels, originally designed by Captain John Schank, were employed upon a number of small Royal Navy vessels around this period, although problems with leaking centerboard cases perhaps discouraged wider experimentation.  Unlike Polychrest with her extraordinary leeway and propensity for missing stays, the real Dart and her sister ship Arrow performed satisfactorily during their Royal Navy service.  Dart was broken up in 1809 and Arrow captured by two French frigates in 1805. O'Brian likely took the poor sailing qualities of Polychrest and perhaps the notion of a new secret weapon from HMS Project. Project was a much smaller vessel than Dart or Polychrest with a very shallow draft to carry a new design of howitzer into coastal waters. Project was broken up in 1810 after only five years of service."]}, {"page": "Mount Schank", "response": ["Mount Schank is a  high dormant volcano in the southeast corner of South Australia, near Mount Gambier.
