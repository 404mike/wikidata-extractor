He started his career in UK karting, before going to Germany to compete in the Formula BMW ADAC Series. He has also raced in Formula Palmer Audi. Due to his lack of funding, he very rarely competes a full series championship. His last current drive was for Tottenham Hotspur in the Superleague Formula in the 2008 season for the Portuguese round.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2007 Formula Palmer Audi season", "response": ["Bacheta took the lead at the start of Round 1 with Hamilton slotting into second. They would be forced to hold station for the opening laps as the safety car was deployed for a collision between Jack Clarke and Andreas Demetriou at Becketts. At the restart on lap seven, Bacheta held off Hamilton, but was passed by him down the National Straight half a lap later. Hamilton went on to win the race by around two seconds, with Jason Moore taking a podium in his first-ever car race, holding off more experienced drivers Dominik Jackson and Tim Bridgman on the final lap to take third.", "Friday's qualifying sessions for the first two races of the weekend saw Jolyon Palmer and Tim Bridgman take the pole positions, with points leader Luciano Bacheta having to settle for a pair of fourths. In Saturday morning's first race (Round 3), Bridgman took the lead from the start and pulled away to take his first victory of the season. Behind, Palmer's challenge for a first podium of 2007 ended with a crash at Surtees.

Eighteen football teams were represented on the grid, the same number of teams as there was at the previous two rounds. There were four driver changes for this round of the championship: Franck Perera joined A.S. Roma replacing Enrico Toccacelo, with Toccacelo moving to the Borussia Dortmund car, replacing Paul Meijer as original driver Nelson Philippe was on GP2 Asia Series duty in Shanghai. Meijer also stayed in the series, moving to the Al Ain car, as both of their previous drivers Andreas Zuber (also in Shanghai) and Bertrand Baguette (in Barcelona for the final World Series by Renault round of the season) were unavailable. Just like Baguette, Duncan Tappy was unavailable to drive the Tottenham Hotspur car, and was replaced by Dominik Jackson. The meeting saw a second win for Liverpool F.C. and a first win for Al Ain. Beijing Guoan extended their championship lead to 35 points, thanks to a pair of fifths for Davide Rigon.", "From the start, Perera led away from Doornbos, Adri\u00e1n Vall\u00e9s (Liverpool F.C.) and Tristan Gommendy (F.C. Porto), with Andersen being delayed from third on the grid. Lower down the field, tenth-placed Max Wissel (FC Basel 1893) collided with seventh-placed Enrico Toccacelo (Borussia Dortmund) collided at Curva 1, with Wissel retiring on the spot and Toccacelo retiring at the end of the lap, with front wing damage from the accident. It stayed that way until the mandatory stops, with Davide Rigon (Beijing Guoan) joining in on the fun also. Lap 10 saw Perera pitting with a four-second lead, closely followed by Vall\u00e9s. A fumble by a rear tyre changer cost the French driver time and the place to Vall\u00e9s. Doornbos came in to pit next time around with Rigon which put Gommendy into the lead, for home side Porto. He would lead for a couple of laps, before pitting which allowed Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia (SC Corinthians) to lead for a lap. When all the stops cycled through, Liverpool led from Milan, Roma and Beijing with Pizzonia up to fifth. Pizzonia would pass Rigon for fourth towards the end of the race as the Italian was nursing an ailing car home with only fourth through sixth gears, and closed to a second behind Perera at the finish. Gommendy's strong run was ended by a water pump failure on lap 26, ruling that car out for the rest of the day. So, Vall\u00e9s won his second Superleague race by 0.948 seconds from Doornbos, and then followed by Perera, Pizzonia, Rigon, Andy Soucek (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid), Alessandro Pier Guidi (Galatasaray S.K.), Borja Garc\u00eda (Sevilla FC), Yelmer Buurman (PSV Eindhoven), Andersen, Tuka Rocha (CR Flamengo), Paul Meijer (Al Ain), Ryan Dalziel (Rangers F.C.), Craig Dolby (R.S.C.
