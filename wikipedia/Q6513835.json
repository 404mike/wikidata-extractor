He was also a member of the Beat scene and in 1963 was involved in editing the one issue magazines Night Scene and Night Train featuring their work, as did Soho and Horde the following year. Tzarad, which he began editing on his own in 1965, ran for two more issues (1966, 1969) and signalled his growing interest in and involvement with the New York School of poets.See the 1972 interview with Eric Mottram in Poetry Information No. 14 (London, autumn/winter 1975-6), pp.4\u201318 It was during this time that he began to engage with French poetry and started on his translations of Tristan Tzara.", "In 1961 he married his first wife, Jenny Goodgame, with whom he had a son, Blake. After the breakdown of this marriage, he met the photographer Judith Walker while a writer in residence at the Aegean School of Fine Arts in Paros, Greece.

In February, McGrath signed goalkeeper Mark Harrison and defender Lee Harwood from Southampton, as well as forward Tony Sealy on loan from Crystal Palace. He also placed fifteen players on the transfer list, after which the Vale went on a six-game unbeaten run. Harwood and Phil Sproson made a solid defensive pair, whilst young Mark Chamberlain (brother of Neville) was used in midfield. The end of their run was a 2\u20132 draw with league leaders Walsall. In March John Fleming arrived on loan from Lincoln City, and the club went on a run of one win in twelve games, ending with a 2\u20131 defeat at Vale Park to fellow strugglers York City. In April, Felix Healy left the club to return to his native Northern Ireland.

Four victories in five games then put Vale into seventh place, and Colin Tartt was signed from Chesterfield for \u00a315,000.

Vale then went on a fifteen match unbeaten run in the league, and between 20 January and 6 March the team went on a club-record six consecutive home draws. Stoke City offered \u00a3100,000 plus incentives for Mark Chamberlain, but Chairman Don Ratcliffe called the offer 'an insult' and rejected it out of hand. Instead Tony Sealy arrived on loan, this time from Queens Park Rangers. On 6 February Mark Chamberlain scored a memorable goal at Field Mill when he stood off the pitch to avoid being caught offside, then returned to tackle a startled Rod Arnold and tap the ball into an empty net. Mansfield Town manager Stuart Boam was so enraged that the goal stood that he raced onto the pitch to verbally abuse the linesman. In March, Johnny Miller had to retire with a knee injury. On 20 March, Mark Harrison conceded 'a crazy goal' from Hull City left-back Dennis Booth at Boothferry Park, whose fifty yard free kick hit the back of the net after several bounces. Injuries hit the Vale squad and the promotion campaign faded away.
