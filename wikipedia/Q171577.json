He won the first Formula Palmer Audi (FPA) in 1998, the International Formula 3000 Championship (IF3000) with Nordic Racing in 2001, and co-won the 2012 24 Hours of Daytona for Michael Shank Racing.\nWilson began karting at the age of eight and achieved consistent results, before progressing to car racing in the Formula Vauxhall Championship. He won the FPA title and earned a fully funded seat in IF3000, becoming the first British driver to win the series championship in 2001. He moved to the 2002 World Series by Nissan for the Racing Engineering team and finished fourth. Through an investment scheme where the public could purchase shares in Wilson, he drove for the Minardi and Jaguar teams in the 2003 F1 season.\nHe drove for the Conquest Racing and RuSPORT teams in the CCWS from 2004 to 2007, winning four races and finishing runner-up in the 2006 and 2007 drivers' championships. Wilson went to Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing for the 2008 IndyCar Series, winning the Detroit Indy Grand Prix. A move to the low-budget Dale Coyne Racing (DCR) team for 2009 resulted in the team's first open-wheel victory at the Grand Prix at the Glen. Wilson moved to the Dreyer & Reinbold Racing squad from 2010 and 2011 but did not win a race. He returned to DCR for 2012 to 2014, winning the 2012 Firestone 550 and finishing sixth in the 2013 drivers' championship.\nLate in the 2015 season, in the ABC Supply 500 at Pocono Raceway, Wilson died after debris from a crashed car struck his helmet. He was the first driver to die from injuries sustained in an IndyCar race since Dan Wheldon in 2011. His organs were donated to save the lives of five people. A hairpin corner at Snetterton Circuit was renamed after him and a memorial fund was established to support his children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 24", "response": ["*  2015   \u2013 Justin Wilson, English racing driver (b. 1978)"]}, {"page": "International Formula 3000", "response": ["|  Justin Wilson"]}, {"page": "1978", "response": ["** Justin Wilson, English race car driver (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "Minardi", "response": ["Before Minardi's demise, the team was a particularly well-liked team within Formula One circles for its friendliness, accessibility, and lack of corporate culture.

They also resisted employing pay-drivers more than most other financially strapped teams.

He won his second Indianapolis 500 pole and led the most laps at 87, but finished fourth to eventual race winner Juan Pablo Montoya. Dixon has an awful weekend to his standards at the Duel in Detroit where he got wrecked in the second duel by his teammate Charlie Kimball. Dixon rebounded and dominated the Firestone 600 at Texas which was his second win of the season. Dixon had average results in the Top 10 with a worst finish of 18th at Iowa, though this helped him since championship rival Juan Pablo Montoya went out very early. Dixon finished a 4th at Mid Ohio, his bread and butter track, and a 9th at Pocono. Dixon went to Sonoma needing to win the race and have Juan Pablo Montoya finish 5th or worse for a 4th Championship and accomplished it.

He finished second in both Texas and Richmond with consecutive pole positions at Nashville and Mid-Ohio, both of which did not result in a race victory.
