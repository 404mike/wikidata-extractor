Queen Philippa, the heroic wife of Edward III, marched against the invaders with a force of about 12,000, whom she encouraged to the unequal conflict. Battle was joined at Neville's Cross, near Durham, 17 Oct. 1346, and the result was a decisive victory for the English. Thomas de Ashton, who fought under Lord Neville, captured the royal standard of Scotland.\nShortly after King David was made prisoner by John de Coupland, variously described as a Lancashire esquire and as a Northumberland gentleman, who was knighted when the king returned from France, but Ashton was still an esquire when, in 1385, he formed one of the retinue of John of Gaunt in his expedition to Spain.\nWilliam de Ashton, doctor of laws, who was also with 'the serene prince, Lord John, king of Castile and Le\u00f3n,' was his uncle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas de Ashton", "response": ["Thomas de Ashton may refer to:", "*Thomas de Ashton (warrior) (fl. 1346), English warrior", "*Thomas de Ashton (alchemist) (born 1403), English alchemist"]}]}}
