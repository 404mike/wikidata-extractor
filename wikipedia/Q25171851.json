Joining the Bury firm of Peel, Yates and Co. as a book-keeper at the age of twenty, he eventually became a partner and amassed a considerable fortune from its success in the textile and calico-printing businesses. Amongst his partners at the firm was the businessman and politician Sir Robert Peel, whose son, also named Sir Robert Peel, served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Norris was reputedly a regular and welcome visitor at the latter's home in Whitehall Gardens.Upon his retirement to Howick House, Penwortham, in 1821, Norris purchased one half of the Lordship of Croston, and dedicated the remainder of his life to artistic and scientific pursuits. In addition to his acquisition of a valuable collection of old master paintings and rare coins, his interest in natural history was reflected by the compilation of an extensive collection of minerals, shells and insects. He was a founder member of the Entomological Society of London (in 1833) and a Fellow of the Astronomical Society of London as early as 1825, continuing as a Fellow of its successor body, the Royal Astronomical Society, from the granting of its charter in 1831 until his death in 1852.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Norris", "response": ["Thomas Norris or Tom Norris may refer to:", "*Sir Thomas Norris (1556\u20131599), English soldier and politician in Ireland", "*Thomas Norris (fl.1363-1391), MP for Lewes (UK Parliament constituency)", "*Thomas Norris (died 1425) (died 1424/25), MP for Barnstaple, Totnes and Plympton Erle", "*Thomas Norris (died 1607), MP for Castle Rising", "*Thomas Norris (died 1700), MP for Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)", "*Thomas Norris (1765\u20131852), English businessman, art collector, naturalist and astronomer", "*Thomas Norris (composer) (1741\u20131790), English musician, singer and composer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Norris (1765-1852)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Norris (1765\u20131852)"]}]}}
