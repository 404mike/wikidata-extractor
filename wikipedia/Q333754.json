In Scotland's first referendum on devolution, held in March 1979, he campaigned for a \"Yes\" vote alongside the Conservative Alick Buchanan-Smith and the Liberal Russell Johnston.

Shortly afterwards, Thorpe received a political boost when the Liberals unexpectedly won a by-election at Birmingham Ladywood, in a previously safe Labour seat. This was a solitary success, and the party faced the general election of June 1970 with little confidence. The results justified their gloomy premonitions; the party's share of the vote fell to 7.5%, and seven of its thirteen seats, including Ladywood, were lost. Thorpe barely hung on in North Devon, his majority reduced to 369. Three of his colleagues had comparably small majorities; only Grimond, Hooson and Russell Johnston were relatively safe. Heath's Conservatives secured a 30-seat majority."]}, {"page": "Liberal Democrat frontbench team", "response": ["|Russell Johnston", "| rowspan=\"3\" |Russell Johnston", "| rowspan=\"3\" |Russell Johnston"]}, {"page": "Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Throughout the 1983 to 1997 period, this marginal constituency was represented by a Liberal, and then Liberal Democrat, MP: Sir David Russell Johnston (later Baron Russell-Johnston), who had been, previously, MP for the Inverness constituency.", "| rowspan=\"2\"| Russell Johnston"]}, {"page": "Inverness (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Russell Johnston"]}, {"page": "1999 Liberal Democrats leadership election", "response": ["*Peers: Dominic Addington, John Alderdice, William Bradshaw, Navnit Dholakia, William Goodhart, Tim Clement-Jones, Richard Holme, Roy Jenkins, Russell Johnston, Anthony Lester, Veronica Linklater, Tom McNally, Emma Nicholson, Dick Newby, Tim Razzall, Rupert Redesdale, Dick Taverne, George Thomson, John Thurso, Alan Watson, Shirley Williams."]}, {"page": "1988 Social and Liberal Democrats leadership election", "response": ["as someone who would guard the Liberals' political integrity.
