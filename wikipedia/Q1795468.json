Ieuan introduced Sampson to Aled Richards, who later replaced him as Catatonia's drummer when Ieuan left to join the Super Furry Animals. The label wanted to market the band, and so at some expense, had photographer Gered Mankowitz conduct a photoshoot with Matthews. She, the band and their management all hated the photos, but the label wanted to use them in order not to write the cost off as a loss. In order to have some photos, a series of black and white photos of Matthews drinking a bottle of wine while wearing a Pepsi T-shirt were taken by one of the press agency staff. Warner Bros liked the images and authorised their use. The band had a recording session at Sawmills Studios, Cornwall, which saw some disagreements during recording between Matthews and Roberts. Afterwards, Sampson was removed as producer following a row over the arrangement for \"Sweet Catatonia\"."]}, {"page": "Island Records", "response": ["There was also a major exhibition at the Vinyl Factory Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica.

The costumes were by Stephen Sprouse. The photography was by Gered Mankowitz. Compiled from the extensive sessions for its predecessor, it was launched without any fanfare or media promotion and failed commercially. A US tour followed, where Jobriath and his backing-band (called 'The Creatures') did several residencies around the US (in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles & Memphis) during which recordings took place at local studios for a projected third album. Despite the tour having several well-attended shows and/or several sold-out nights, both Brandt and Elektra stopped financing the tour midway through. Despite this, Jobriath and the band completed the tour, continuing to bill Elektra for expenses. A final show, at the University of Alabama, ended in five encores and the fire department being summoned when the excited audience set off the alarm."]}, {"page": "Sandy Denny", "response": ["In 1973, she married long-term boyfriend and producer Trevor Lucas and recorded a third solo album, Like an Old Fashioned Waltz.

The photographer was Gered Mankowitz, who also shot the band photos for the cover of Out of Our Heads. The shoot took place at 5:30 in the morning following an all night recording session at Olympic Studios. Using a home-made camera filter constructed of black card, glass and Vaseline, Mankowitz created the effect of the Stones dissolving into their surroundings. The goal of the shoot was, in Mankowitz's words, \"to capture the ethereal, druggy feel of the time; that feeling at the end of the night when dawn was breaking and they'd been up all night making music, stoned.\" Brian Jones' disheveled and gaunt appearance on the cover disturbed many of his fans, and critic David Dalton wrote that he looked \"like a doomed albino raccoon.\""]}, {"page": "Red (King Crimson album)", "response": ["*Gered Mankowitz \u2013 photography"]}, {"page": "Fran\u00e7oise Hardy", "response": ["As a public figure, Hardy is renowned for her shyness and reservedness, and observers have emphasized her \"anti-social nature as a celebrity\". She has been open in her autobiography and in interviews about her struggles with anxiety, self-doubt, loneliness and inferiority complex.Hardy, 2018 [2008], \"Eight\" Uncuts Tom Pinnock noted that \"it was her refusal to play the showbusiness game that made her something of an icon.\" The singer's sudden celebrity status was a source of great discomfort for her, claiming in 2011: \"I didn't enjoy at all everything, the trappings, when all of a sudden you become very famous. (...) [Being taken up by fashion houses] was work, things I had to do, a chore\u2014I didn't enjoy it at all... It is quite impossible to stand\u2014to be admired too much\u2014it is not a normal situation. I don't like that at all. I am not comfortable with my professional life really, so the word 'icon'\u2014it's as though you were talking about someone else, it's not me really.\" She regularly suffered from stage fright, which led to her stopping performing live altogether in 1968. Her public image and style during the 1960s made an impact on international pop culture, something that overshadowed her skills as a singer outside of France.Quinonero, 2017, \"\u00abSon allure de page travesti\u00bb\" As Hardy's almost exclusive photographer and agent during the decade, Jean-Marie P\u00e9rier became a Pygmalion-like figure for her,Deluxe, 2013. p. 29 transforming the singer's public image from \"a shy, gauche-looking schoolgirl\" into a \"modern young trend-setter.\" She wrote: \"...[P\u00e9rier] tried to open my mind and help me in all domains with his characteristic generosity. For example, he taught me to love the cinema by bringing me to see great films, and under his tutelage I realized the importance of aesthetics, which became one of my major criteria. He taught me how to carry myself and to dress, and gave me advice on social skills\". He persuaded the singer to begin modelling and she soon became \"a star of the international fashion world as well as the French music scene.\" She was also notably photographed by Gered Mankowitz, William Klein and Richard Avedon for Vogue and other publications. Her regular appearance on magazine covers gave her the reputation of being the quintessential French cover girl of the 1960s. In 1967, teen magazine Special Pop wrote: \"Fran\u00e7oise manages to attract both kids and their parents, men and women alike. More than a singer, she's becoming a universal myth with whom thousands of young girls dream of identifying.\" Nevertheless, she was disenchanted with the lifestyle of the jet-set and high society, and in the 1970s abandoned the image of \"fashionable young girl about town\" that P\u00e9rier had created for her."]}, {"page": "Lionheart (Kate Bush album)", "response": ["The album was released in November 1978, the title being taken from side one's closing track \"Oh England My Lionheart\".
