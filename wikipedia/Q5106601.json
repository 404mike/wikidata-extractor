Unable to break into the first team, he joined Gillingham for a short stint until he was signed by Colchester United manager George Burley. Allen made just two Football League substitute appearances for the club, the first as a replacement for Paul Abrahams in a 1\u20130 win against Hartlepool United at Layer Road on 10 September 1994, and in the second he came on for Chris Fry in a 3\u20132 away victory at Darlington on 24 September. Shortly after this, Allen was released from Colchester as Burley built up his squad."]}]}}
