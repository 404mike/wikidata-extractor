Howe), which covered his life during and after the series. In 2000, Jon Pertwee: The Biography by Bernard Bale () was published by Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, and included a few chapters by Pertwee's widow Ingeborg."]}, {"page": "The Pirate Planet", "response": ["Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \"An inventive story, The Pirate Planet has matured into a satisfying mixture of the clever and the absurd.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described the serial as \"enjoyable\", especially due to Baker and Tamm's performances as well as the Captain and Mr Fibuli. However, they wrote that the other supporting characters were \"simply awful\". In 2011, Mark Braxton of Radio Times noted a few plot holes and that the budget could not convey the scope of ideas, but he praised the performances and the story's playful tone. DVD Talk's Justin Felix gave The Pirate Planet three and a half out of four stars, describing the story as \"quite clever\" and \"fun\", but felt that it was let down by over-the-top acting. In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger of the third episode as one of the best cliffhangers in Doctor Who history."]}, {"page": "The Robots of Death", "response": ["Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping, in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), called the script \"one of the best ever\" and praised how it was enhanced by the design, acting, and direction. In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker expressed similar praise, describing it as a \"true classic\" and praising the Art Deco design. In 2010, Mark Braxton of Radio Times noted a few production errors but overall praised the design and voices of the robots and the score. He also called the story \"extraordinary\", despite there being a coldness between Baker and Jameson that made it to the screen. DVD Talk's Ian Jane was less positive, giving the story three and a half out of five stars. He found the plot \"a fairly standard murder mystery\" but still \"a good amount of fun\", and praised Baker and Jameson. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 recommended The Robots of Death, remarking that \"it might be becoming my favorite classic Doctor Who story\". In Doctor Who: The Complete Guide, Mark Campbell awarded it ten out of ten, writing \"fabulous design work, hugely suspenseful music and a very believable scenario make this one of the programme's most durable tales. The killer may be obvious, but the tension is wrung out to the bitter end.\""]}, {"page": "Invasion of the Dinosaurs", "response": ["In The Discontinuity Guide (1998), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping noted that \"the special effects are woeful\" and there was some padding, but the story \"has many redeeming features, most notably the sombre location footage in the first episode\". David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker in their analysis in Doctor Who: The Television Companion, felt that unfortunately the \"awfulness of the dinosaur scenes tends to overshadow the excellence of Paddy Russell's direction of the rest of the story and the high quality of the performances by the assembled cast\". Though they were favourable towards the plot, they noted that \"the story is poorly paced and contains a tremendous amount of padding\"."]}, {"page": "Delta and the Bannermen", "response": ["David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker found the serial to be even more whimsical than the preceding story but more successful, believing it was \"all in all, a highly enjoyable romp.\" For Radio Times, Mark Braxton awarded it three stars out of five, declaring, \"It's mad as cheese and about as scary as an episode of Play Away. It doesn't feel like Doctor Who for a second. But just once in a while the show can afford to go mad.\""]}, {"page": "An Unearthly Child", "response": ["Retrospective reviews are mostly positive towards An Unearthly Child. In 1980, John Peel described the story as \"a work of loving craftsmanship, worked out to perfection by all concerned\". Referring to the serial while discussing the early years of Doctor Who in 1982, New Scientists Peltu praised the script, acting and direction, but criticised the dated scenery. In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the first episode as \"twenty-five of the most important minutes in British television\", particularly praising the directorial techniques, but felt that the following three episodes declined in quality. In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker lauded Hartnell's performance and the reveal of the TARDIS interior in the first episode, and felt that the following three episodes were lesser in quality but remained \"intense\" and \"highly dramatic\".  In A Critical History of Doctor Who (1999), John Kenneth Muir called the serial \"an unqualified success as drama\", applauding the writing, cinematic style, and production techniques."]}, {"page": "Doctor Who (season 23)", "response": ["The Trial of a Time Lord received mixed reviews from Doctor Who critics. Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, co-authors of The Discontinuity Guide, wrote that as a whole, the serial's plot 'hangs together remarkably well'. David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker, authors of Doctor Who: The Television Companion, disagreed, arguing that the serial was a 'monumental wasted opportunity'. They disapproved of the trial storyline, being unconvinced that a prosecutor 'in any reasonable legal system' would be allowed to modify charges and court proceedings mid-trial. However, they did find the meta-humour of 'the Doctor effectively sitting down to watch Doctor Who for fourteen weeks' amusing if repetitive, and praised Baker's acting. Both reviews found that the trial scenes detracted from the chapter story arcs."]}, {"page": "The Daleks", "response": ["Following the broadcast of the fifth episode, the Daily Mirrors Richard Sear described the show as \"splendid children's stuff\", describing the cliffhanger as \"smashing\". Retrospective reviews were also positive. In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the serial as \"brilliantly directed, full of inventive touches and wonderful set-pieces\"; they noted that the first four episodes helped to launch Doctor Who to success, but wrote that the last three \"comprise a B-movie trek through hideous landscapes\", comparing it unfavourably to Flash Gordon. In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the serial for introducing the Daleks and lauded Cusick's designs, but felt that the Thals\u2014particularly after the death of their leader Temmosus in the fourth episode\u2014were \"faceless stereotypes\" used only for plot, and criticised their costume design. In A Critical History of Doctor Who (1999), John Kenneth Muir similarly praised the Daleks, as well as Barry's \"stylish\" direction and the performances of Hill and Hartnell. In 2006, DVD Talk John Sinnott, despite noting that \"there are a few parts that drag just a bit\", commended the script for allowing the characters to develop and holding tension unlike the previous serial. In 2008, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised the strength of Nation's scripts, particularly the first three cliffhangers, but felt that \"the urgency and claustrophobia dissipate towards the end\", describing the final battle as \"a disappointingly limp affair\". In 2011, Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club wrote that the serial is \"quite solid, full of well-paced action and some interestingly subtle characterizations, though it definitely begins to drag around the fifth episode, with a long trek through swamps and caverns that moves the plot forward by about an inch\"."]}, {"page": "Spearhead from Space", "response": ["In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the serial was \"arguably the first to really go for the viewer's jugular with a potent combination of horror and science-fiction.\" They continued, \"It is the terrifying and well-realised concept of killer shop dummies that makes Spearhead from Space one of the most horrific Doctor Who stories ever [...] Particularly notable is the uncompromising, adult quality of the story's realisation, which sets it apart from much of sixties Doctor Who and contributes greatly to its success.\" Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded Spearhead from Space five stars out of five, describing it as an \"extraordinary debut for the third Doctor\" and also a good performance from Courtney; while positive towards John, Mulkern criticised the way Liz was \"severely styled.\" He also commended the production, particularly Dudley Simpson's score. He wrote that \"the only real disappointment is the lacklustre representation of the Nestene\" and stated that the \"boggle-eyed Pertwee\" at the end, when he is strangled by the tentacles, \"always warrants a snicker\"."]}, {"page": "The Edge of Destruction", "response": ["At a BBC Programme Review Board Meeting in February 1964, controller of television programmes Stuart Hood felt that the serial's sequences in which Susan uses scissors as a weapon \"digressed from the code of violence in programmes\"; Lambert apologised for the scenes. In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote that the story \"manages to flesh out the central figures at the expense of the plot\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker \u200bconsidered the second episode superior to the first and, noting the serial's origins as a \"filler\", noted that it \"works remarkably well\". In A Critical History of Doctor Who (1999), John Kenneth Muir praised the serial's exploration of its characters' relationships, an element that the show would eventually lose after the departure of Russell and Hill. In a 2008 review, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times described Whitaker as \"a master of dialogue, characterisation and atmosphere\", but felt he struggled with plot logic, as evidenced by the fast return switch explanation. Despite this, he stated that the ending had \"charm\" as the TARDIS travellers began to become friends. DVD Talk's John Sinnott felt that The Edge of Destruction was the weakest of the show's first three serials, writing that it had \"some good moments\" but \"overall it doesn't hang together quite as well\" as the preceding two stories; he commented that it felt \"rushed\" and the resolution was a \"cop-out\". The serial was recommended by Charlie Jane Anders of io9 as an example of the classic series for new viewers to watch, describing it as \"a quick hit ... and still just as intense as it was\"."]}, {"page": "Marco Polo (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The serial received positive reviews from television critics and viewers. Following the broadcast of the first episode, the BBC Programme Review Board noted that there were \"several appreciative notes\" on the show. Philip Purser of The Sunday Telegraph noted that Eden impersonated Marco Polo \"with sartorial dash\", but felt that the main characters were poorly written, describing Barbara as \"a persistent drip\". In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote that the story was \"wonderful, but a little too loose and unstructured to be the all conquering classic of repute\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described the serial as \"an amazing tour de force\", praising Lucarrotti's scripts, dialogue, and characters, Hussein's direction, Newbery's sets, Dare's costumes, Cary's score, and the cast performances. In a 2008 review, Mark Braxton of Radio Times praised the serial, stating that \"the historical landscape was rarely mapped with such poetry and elegance\", though he noted inconsistencies in the foreign characters' accents. In Doctor Who: The Complete History (2016), editor John Ainsworth described the serial as \"exotic and arresting\", praising the simplicity of the narrative and the exploration of the characters."]}, {"page": "The Keys of Marinus", "response": ["The serial received mixed reviews. Bob Leeson of the Daily Worker felt that the fifth episode of the serial was the show's low point, noting that the introduction of a trial scene represented a rushed script. In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping felt that the episodic narrative left little room for each story to develop, and that the show's limited budget was evident. In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised Cusick's work with a limited budget, and enjoyed the serial's conclusion. In A Critical History of Doctor Who (1999), John Kenneth Muir lauded the serial's depiction of co-existing\u2014but not strictly interconnected\u2014cultures and the development of their world. In a 2008 review, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times wrote that \"standards slip appreciably\" after the four preceding serials in terms of \"ambitious but slapdash\" script quality, as well as the below-par sets and supporting characters."]}, {"page": "Genesis of the Daleks", "response": ["At the time of broadcast, there were some complaints about the level of violence portrayed. Mary Whitehouse, of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, complained that Genesis contained \"tea-time brutality for tots\". Scenes objected to included the depictions of war and Nyder hitting the Doctor. However, David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker, in their Doctor Who: The Television Companion (1998), recorded a positive reaction from fans in regards to creativity and Davros, though one writer noted the ending did not satisfyingly close the story. The BBC's Audience Research Report concluded, \"A little more complex than some Doctor Who adventures, perhaps, and with underlying questions of conscience, the serial had been 'different' it was occasionally felt and, although dismissed in some quarters as far-fetched, long drawn-out, confused and/or predictable, had provided acceptable escapist entertainment for the majority.\" Howe and Walker themselves described the serial as \"well-written and full of new ideas, while still remaining true to the Daleks' roots by effectively equating them with the Nazis\", and particularly praised the production values, pacing, and moral dilemma. However, they considered it to have a few minor flaws, namely Harry being attacked by a giant clam, some \"duff\" cliffhangers, and \"many of the scientist characters serve no other purpose than to act as Dalek-fodder\"."]}, {"page": "The War Games", "response": ["Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \"It might be six episodes too long, but The War Games is pivotal in the history of Doctor Who. The introduction of the Time Lords ... sees the series lose some of its mystery, but gain a new focus.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that the serial \"gets off to a cracking start\", though they noted that \"A commonly expressed view is that, after this strong beginning, the story becomes dull and repetitive, picking up again only in the closing stages when the Time Lords are introduced.\" They praised the design work of the different war zones, the dialogue, and the conclusion. In 2009, Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was positive towards the detailed scripts and the various villains, especially the War Chief. The A.V. Club reviewer praised the way the serial subverted viewers' expectations of a typical historical story. He noted that there was padding to fill the running time, but felt that it was done well and that it worked better than in The Dalek Invasion of Earth. He also wrote positively of Madoc's War Lord and Jamie and Zoe's departure, and said that the story purposefully \"doesn't resolve neatly or satisfyingly\". Alasdair Wilkins of io9 praised Troughton's performance and the way that it was structured to \"constantly [expand] the story's scope\", though he admitted there was still padding. In a 2010 article, Charlie Jane Anders of the same site listed the cliffhanger to the ninth episode\u00a0\u2014 in which the Doctor and his companions escape the base and try to get back to the TARDIS but their movements are slowed down as the Doctor tries to unlock and open the TARDIS doors\u00a0\u2014 as one of the greatest Doctor Who cliffhangers ever."]}, {"page": "The Evil of the Daleks", "response": ["Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a positive review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), describing it as \"a grandiose production which papers over its scientifically implausible aspects with a confident swagger.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker noted how The Evil of the Daleks paid tribute to the series' past, and praised Whitaker's writing and the production values. In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded it five stars out of five and wrote that the story \"boasts an intriguing mystery, well-drawn characters, atmospheric settings and thrilling set-pieces\", though it did have an \"overly elaborate\" plot. He particularly praised Jamie, as well as the incidental music."]}, {"page": "The Aztecs (Doctor Who)", "response": ["Retrospective reviews of the serial were also positive. In 1986, Tim Munro of Star Begotten considered the serial \"one of the shining jewels of the Hartnell era\" and of the entire classic series to date, praising Lucarotti's writing and characters, especially of the Doctor, considering the story one of his best. In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the serial as a \"lyrical piece of BBC costume drama and a gem to cherish\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker felt that, while it lacks the epic nature of Marco Polo, The Aztecs is a \"fascinating and compelling depiction of the Aztec civilisation\", praising Lucarotti's characterisation. In A Critical History of Doctor Who (1999), John Kenneth Muir called The Aztecs \"perhaps the best-written of Doctor Who first-year serials\", and Lucarotti's script as \"among the best written and best executed stories\" of the classic series; he praised the characterisation, tension, and philosophical nature of the script, as well as the central role of Barbara and the performances of Hill, Russell, and Ringham."]}, {"page": "Terror of the Autons", "response": ["Jon Pertwee would later state that he thought the story \"was excellent. One of the best we ever did.\" Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping simply wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \"Functional and memorably scary, but by no means an Auton story.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker called it a \"strong start\" to the season, though they commented that the story was not as effective as Spearhead from Space in \"depicting the threat of the Autons.\" They praised the introduction of the Master, calling him \"the most interesting character to have been introduced to the series since the Doctor himself\", though they found it improbable that one comment from the Doctor would persuade him to change his plan. Howe and Walker also praised Letts' direction, though they found that the over-use of CSO caused some scenes to \"look false and strained\". In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times compared the serial to a comic strip and wrote positively about Manning and Delgado. However, he noted that there were \"plot holes\" and \"gaudy early '70s production values\". Ian Berriman of SFX, reviewing the serial for its 2011 DVD release, also commented that Delgado was \"note-perfect from the off\" and that while the climax was \"feeble\", he felt \"it's all such outrageous fun that it doesn't really matter\". DVD Talk reviewer John Sinnott described Terror of the Autons as \"a wonderful romp,\" although \"the ending is rushed and pretty much just pulled out of nowhere\". Sinnott particularly praised the Doctor and the Master, as well as the \"subtle humor\". Den of Geek's James Peatly wrote that Terror of the Autons was \"a fantastically entertaining and incredibly confident slice of macabre fun\". He was positive toward the family tone, Jo, and the Master but felt that it \"lacks some of the narrative cohesion\" of Spearhead from Space and \"the Autons are reduced to playing the role of foot soldiers to the Master\". In 2009, SFX named the cliffhanger to Episode Two, in which the policeman is revealed to be an Auton, as the 20th scariest moment in Doctor Who."]}, {"page": "The Deadly Assassin", "response": ["Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \"The reputation of The Deadly Assassin rests with its violence and its revelations about the Doctor's people and their culture. Politically literate and cynical ('We must adjust the truth'), the serial is the definitive text on the Time Lords. The Doctor's journey into the APC net ... is a visual and intellectual tour de force of hallucinatory images.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker reported that at the time of broadcast several viewers took issue with the serial's portrayal of the Time Lords, finding it a contradiction of the small details that had previously been dropped about the Doctor's home planet, but over time its reputation became more positive. The pair themselves called it \"a truly remarkable story\" and praised the reintroduction of the Master. In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded the serial four stars out of five. He described \"the Master's putrid skull and split bangers for fingers\" as \"the most revolting images presented on teatime TV\" but was positive towards its supporting characters, though he did criticise the Matrix sequences for being more earthly rather than alien, despite them being constructed from deceased Time Lords. The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn praised the plotting and Matrix sequences, calling it \"well-crafted all around\". "]}, {"page": "The Tomb of the Cybermen", "response": ["Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote favourably of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), despite some criticism, \"The first two episodes are wonderful, a well directed and expensive looking restating of the series' basics, but once the Cybermen are released from the Tombs, they go back in again.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that the serial was similar to the previous Cybermen stories, but it \"manages to develop the idea to greater advantage and, as a result, achieves a considerable success\" and was \"well-paced, gripping and, in places, genuinely frightening\". They praised the Cybermen, but said the noise they made while being attacked was \"silly\", and also criticised some of the direction and Deborah Watling's Victoria, whom they felt was an inconsistent character."]}, {"page": "The Five Doctors", "response": ["Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping wrote of the special in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \"A fine anniversary tale, although don't analyse the plot too closely as it's largely a collection of set pieces without a great deal of substance. This is Terrance Dicks' loving tribute to a series that he helped to mould and, as such, contains everything that it should.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that The Five Doctors \"is not as bad as it could have been ... [but] the story fairly groans at the seams with the inclusion of so many 'old favourites'.\" Still, they felt that it worked as a one-off fun celebration."]}, {"page": "The Dalek Invasion of Earth", "response": ["Retrospective reviews of the serial were generally positive. In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping praised the exterior sequences of the Daleks, though noted the less impressive production of the Slyther. In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described the serial as \"one of the series' all-time greats\", with impressive scripting and location filming despite some clumsy direction; they also praised the \"poignant and moving\" final scene. In A Critical History of Doctor Who (1999), John Kenneth Muir found the episode to be one of Doctor Who darkest, and praised the location shooting and the characterisation of Susan, though noted some sexism in the Doctor's final remarks and criticised some \"positively amateurish\" special effects. In 2008, Mark Braxton of Radio Times praised the supporting cast, location filming, and emotional ending, but noted the continuity errors concerning the Daleks and the production shortcomings as a result of the serial's ambition. In a 2011 review, The A.V. Clubs Christopher Bahn criticised the serial's slow pacing and the uninteresting concept of the Robomen, and noted that Susan's departure lacked dramatic impact because the Doctor chose for her; however, he praised the first episode and its cliffhanger, and the characterisation of the Doctor. In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the first episode's cliffhanger as one of the greatest in the show's history."]}]}}
