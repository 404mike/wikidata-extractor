He is the grandson of Paddy Kennedy.\nA former England under-19 international, he began his career in the academies at Manchester City and Leicester City, before signing with Scottish Premiership side Motherwell in July 2015. He left the club to join AFC Fylde in March 2017, before moving on to Macclesfield Town four months later. He won the National League title with Macclesfield during the 2017\u201318 season, and was bought by Shrewsbury Town in June 2018. He failed to break into the first-team with Shrewsbury however, and was allowed to sign with Wrexham in January 2019, before he returned to the English Football League with Port Vale in June 2019. However he returned to Wrexham on loan in November 2019. He was released by Port Vale and went on to sign with York City in August 2020, Macclesfield in June 2021 and then Stockport Town in September 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Askey", "response": ["Askey let 14 players go and signed 14 new players for the 2019\u201320 season, with big names departing including Ben Whitfield, Luke Hannant and Ricky Miller, whilst backup goalkeeper Sam Hornby chose to leave after rejecting a new contract offer. Coming into the club were goalkeeper Jonny Maddison; defenders Adam Crookes, Kieran Kennedy and Shaun Brisley; midfielders Scott Burgess, Ryan Lloyd, Callum Evans, Alex Hurst and Jake Taylor (on loan); wingers David Amoo and Rhys Browne; and strikers Mark Cullen, Richie Bennett and Jordan McFarlane-Archer. He was again nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month, with the EFL writing that \"Slow and steady has been Vale's progress under Askey's astute management this season. Their consistency in February - three wins, three draws and 12 goals from six games - finally lifted his side into the play-off positions.\" However the club were one place outside the play-offs when the season was called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England.", "Askey has a reputation for playing attractive football and for managing teams on a budget by spotting ability in young players and helping revive the careers of players whose careers had stalled. His favoured formation is a 4\u20133\u20133 and he prefers to play with a high-tempo, pressing style. Former player Adam Yates said that Askey was a hard working coach who was open to input from his players and did not hold a grudge; in terms of tactics he felt Askey was \"quite fond of the three in midfield and three up top\". Macclesfield and Port Vale defender Kieran Kennedy said that Askey liked to play passing football but also \"he had a plan B, C and D which really helped us if we were up against it.\" Football agent Phil Sproson described Askey as \"an attack-minded manager\"."]}, {"page": "Paddy Kennedy (association footballer)", "response": ["Kennedy later managed a local amateur side in Urmston, close to Old Trafford, where he remained resident until his death in March 2007.

Though the budget was reduced he aimed to have a smaller and more competitive squad. His first summer signing was midfielder Scott Burgess, released from Bury despite an impressive loan spell at York City; the 21-year-old had previously played on loan at Macclesfield Town in Askey's National League title winning season. He next signed Adam Crookes, a 21-year-old defender who had been released by Nottingham Forest despite impressing whilst on loan at Vale in the second half of the 2018\u201319 season. He then signed 25-year-old Kieran Kennedy, \"a footballing centre-half\" who turned down a new deal at Wrexham in order to return to the English Football League. Big target man striker Richie Bennett then joined, having been let go by Carlisle United. The signings of 27-year-old former Blackpool striker Mark Cullen and 25-year-old former youth-team midfielder Ryan Lloyd were confirmed on 26 June. On 8 July, winger David Amoo arrived on a one-year deal after rejecting a new contract with Cambridge United; this was the first signing to meet Askey's priorities of bringing in a winger, a right-back and a backup goalkeeper. Askey also evaluated five trialists in pre-season friendlies: 19-year-old Bradford (Park Avenue) midfielder Alex Hurst, former Darlington goalkeeper Jonny Maddison, former Millwall and Reading right-back Shaun Cummings, former Yeovil Town winger Rhys Browne and former Coventry City striker Kwame Thomas. Cummings left without a contract as Askey instead again signed another of his former Macclesfield Town players, 23-year-old Callum Evans, who \u2013 like Lloyd \u2013 had been released by Macclesfield boss Sol Campbell. Bookmakers predicted a mid-table finish for the club. The club kit was reverted to Erre\u00e0 manufacturers and the shirt sponsors were revealed as Synectics Solutions, the company owned by chairpersons Carol and Kevin Shanahan. The black and gold away kit was launched in tribute to the protestors who helped to oust Smurthwaite. As pre-season drew to a close the club took a week long trip to Scotland. Trialist winger Rhys Browne, yet another former Macclesfield player, became the ninth summer signing on the day of the club's final pre-season friendly. Signing number ten was the new back-up goalkeeper, 24-year-old Jonny Maddison, who had impressed on trial. A third of the five trialists was also signed, though Alex Hurst was immediately loaned back to Bradford (Park Avenue) in order to gain match experience.", "On 15 May, League Two clubs voted to end the season after 37 games, causing Vale to finish one place outside the play-offs; CEO Colin Garlick said that the club had voted for the proposal despite meaning they narrowly would miss out on the play-offs as it would help to secure the financial future of all the clubs in the division. A BBC Sport study with Professor James Reade and Dr Carl Singleton from the Economics Department at the University of Reading predicted that Vale would have finished seventh if the season had played out. Askey confirmed that eight players would be offered new contracts \u2013 Luke Joyce, David Amoo, Rhys Browne, Shaun Brisley, Cristian Monta\u00f1o, Tom Conlon, Mark Cullen and Nathan Smith \u2013 whilst six players would be released: Will Atkinson, Kieran Kennedy, Callum Evans, Ryan Lloyd, Jonny Maddison and Jordan McFarlane-Archer.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||6||align=\"left\"| Kieran Kennedy", "|6||||DF||Kieran Kennedy||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||1||0", "| 1 July 2019 || CB ||  || Kieran Kennedy || Wrexham || Free transfer || ", "| 19 May 2020 || CB ||  || Kieran Kennedy || York City || Released || ", "| 20 November 2019 || CB ||  || Kieran Kennedy ||  Wrexham || 23 April 2020 || "]}, {"page": "Kieran James Kennedy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kieran Kennedy"]}]}}
