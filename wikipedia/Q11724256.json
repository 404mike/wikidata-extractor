He also finished in third place in the 1989 World Final. Doncaster finished equal on 12 points with countryman Simon Wigg who defeated him in a run-off for second place.Doncaster spent most of his career with the Ipswich Witches,  but when they dropped to the British League Division Two he moved to Reading Racers where he was twice a member of British League winning teams, in 1990 and 1992. He also rode in the Swedish League for Bysarna. He had also twice won the Golden Helmet of Pardubice (CZE) in 1989 and 1990.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Olympiastadion (Munich)", "response": ["The Olympic Stadium also hosted Motorcycle speedway when it held the 1989 World Final on 2 September 1989.

Three time champion Erik Gundersen of Denmark finished in fourth place with 11 points. Gundersen, the defending World Champion, missed finishing outright second when his bike's engine expired while he was leading Heat 9 of the World Final."]}, {"page": "Reading Racers", "response": ["The club enjoyed a successful 1980 season, winning the British League title and attracting crowds of over 7,000 on a regular basis. Reading's success came down to three strong heat leaders, Swedish champion Jan Andersson, their new American signing Bobby Schwartz and England international John Davis. All three produced season averages around the 10 mark, which enabled the team to constantly pick up victories. The club made headline news with a \u00a340,000 insurance bond payment for winning the league title, which gained much media interest. However, behind the scenes unrest in the management structure saw major changes at the end of the season with Bill Dore taking control of the club with local businessman Frankie Higley. Dore's daughter Pat Bliss became more involved in the running of the speedway and Dore's son Martyn was tasked with the maintenance of the track and stadium. Despite tracking very competitive looking teams in the mid-1980s the club never achieved the dizzy heights of the start of the decade, until 1990 when the appointment of loyal fan Tim Sugar as the team manager saw the club win the league title in both 1990 and 1992, with top rider Per Jonsson also crowned world speedway champion in 1990. Jeremy Doncaster and their new Australian signing Todd Wiltshire topped the reading averages in 1990 and Jonsson averaged 10.04 in 1992. However, Jonsson suffered terrible injuries in a crash in Poland in 1994, and this had an adverse effect on the club and its fortunes. 1995 and 1996 were poor seasons for the club, as crowds dropped and media interest waned.
