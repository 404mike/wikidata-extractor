In this paper, they speculate that code constraints on nucleotide sequences allow protein synthesis without the need for a ribosome. It, however, requires a five base binding between the mRNA and tRNA with a flip of the anti-codon creating a triplet coding, even though it is a five-base physical interaction. Thomas H. Jukes pointed out that the code constraints on the mRNA sequence required for this translation mechanism is still preserved."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["* Thomas H.

Arbib did not name any individuals in his article, but when contacted by the Times,  said they included Edwards, Thomas H. Jukes, and Robert H. White-Stevens, among others.

Though King and Jukes produced much lower estimates of substitution rates and the resulting genetic load in the case of non-neutral changes, they agreed that neutral mutations driven by genetic drift were both real and significant.  The fairly constant rates of evolution observed for individual proteins was not easily explained without invoking neutral substitutions (though G. G. Simpson and Emil Smith had tried).  Jukes and King also found a strong correlation between the frequency of amino acids and the number of different codons encoding each amino acid. This pointed to substitutions in protein sequences as being largely the product of random genetic drift.Dietrich, \"The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution\", pp. 50-54"]}, {"page": "Non-Darwinian Evolution (paper)", "response": ["\"Non-Darwinian Evolution\" is a scientific paper written by Jack Lester King and Thomas H.
