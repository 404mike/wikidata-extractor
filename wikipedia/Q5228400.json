A midfielder, in a sixteen-year career he scored 22 goals in 455 games in the Football League.\nStarting his career at Wrexham in 1993, he lifted the Welsh Cup and FAW Premier Cup with the club. He moved on to Port Vale for an initial \u00a3350,000 fee in March 1999. In 2001 he lifted the Football League Trophy, and was also made the club's Player of the Year. Following this success he was sold on to Crewe Alexandra for \u00a3500,000. He helped the \"Alex\" win promotion out of the Second Division in 2002\u201303. After three years with Crewe he switched to Stoke City in 2007, thereby becoming one of a small number of players to have played for the three local rivals of Crewe, Stoke and Vale. He spent 2007 to 2009 at Millwall, before finishing his career at Vale Park later in 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wrexham A.F.C.", "response": ["*1993\u20131994  Dave Brammer"]}, {"page": "Tony Pulis", "response": ["In the following season, 2003\u201304, Pulis guided the club to an 11th-place finish. Tensions grew between the manager and chairman, Gunnar G\u00edslason, in the 2004\u201305 season. Pulis was frustrated with his lack of transfer funds which led to Dave Brammer and Steve Simonsen, both of whom were free agents, being his only significant signings prior to the start of the season. Pulis, however, did add Anthony Pulis, his son, and Lewis Buxton to his squad in January 2005. The disagreement between Pulis and the club's Icelandic ownership culminated with Pulis parting company with the club on 28 June 2005. He was sacked for \"failing to exploit the foreign transfer market\" by then chairman G\u00edslason. Following his dismissal, Pulis bemoaned the club's decision to sell Ade Akinbiyi to Championship rivals Burnley, stating, \"We sold our top scorer and never replaced him.\" Dutch manager Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis' successor on 29 June 2005, only a day after Pulis was sacked."]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["In order to help the Vale to avoid relegation at the end of the 1998\u201399 season, Horton brought in five players: Dave Brammer (Manchester City), Tony Butler (Blackpool), Carl Griffiths (Leyton Orient), Alex Smith (Chester City), and Chris Allen (Nottingham Forest). This spending spree set the club back \u00a3630,000, and so Horton first sold off Peter Beadle to Notts County for \u00a3250,000 in order to raise the cash needed for his new signings. He won his first game in charge, a 2\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town, thanks to a brace from Martin Foyle. A five-game unbeaten run in April allowed the Vale to finish above relegated Bury on goals scored.", "In preparation for life in the Second Division, Horton signed Dean Delany, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and Michael Twiss on free transfers. Horton came under pressure from the board at the start of the 2000\u201301 campaign, as his team went 13 games without a win, and were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League Canvey Island. Horton described it as \"the greatest embarrassment of my football career\". He responded to this humiliation by placing five players on the transfer list. He signed Steve Brooker for \u00a315,000; brought in Onandi Lowe and Richard Burgess on free transfer, whilst also offloading Jeff Minton to Rotherham United. Vale's form improved, as they avoided defeat to Stoke City in both Potteries derby games. Horton was named Manager of the Month in March, after a good run of results ended fears of a second successive relegation. He also won his first trophy as a manager as Vale lifted the Football League Trophy, coming from behind to beat Brentford at the Millennium Stadium.
