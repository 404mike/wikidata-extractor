His son Mark was also a professional footballer.\nAfter a 19-year career as a central defender in the lower divisions, he became manager of Shrewsbury Town. After winning the Third Division, he oversaw five seasons in the Second Division before being appointed manager of Aston Villa. With little success in two years, he was sacked and went to Wolves whom he took from the Fourth Division to the Second Division, winning the Football League Trophy along the way.\nHe left in 1994 and had a year out of football before his arrival at Hereford United. A run to the Division Three play-offs was a false dawn, and a year later the Bulls were relegated to the Conference. Having initially resigned, Turner ended up buying the majority shareholding and becoming chairman in 1998. Five financially troubled seasons followed in non-league football, before he led the Bulls to three consecutive runners-up spots and promotion in 2006.\nAfter a mid-table finish in the 2006\u201307 season, Turner delivered another promotion the following season with a third-place finish in League Two; notably making full use of the loan system. Turner was voted League Two Manager of the Year by the League Managers Association, but was unable to lead the Bulls to survival in League One.

Building on that, the team achieved both the Fourth and Third Division championships in the next two seasons and won the 1988 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley.", "The club's most successful manager is Stan Cullis, whose 16-year tenure brought all three of Wolves' league championships as well as two FA Cup triumphs.
