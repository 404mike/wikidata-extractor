Neon was discovered when Ramsay chilled a sample of air until it became a liquid, then warmed the liquid and captured the gases as they boiled off. The gases nitrogen, oxygen, and argon had been identified, but the remaining gases were isolated in roughly their order of abundance, in a six-week period beginning at the end of May 1898. First to be identified was krypton. The next, after krypton had been removed, was a gas which gave a brilliant red light under spectroscopic discharge. This gas, identified in June, was named \"neon\", the Greek analogue of the Latin novum ('new') suggested by Ramsay's son. The characteristic brilliant red-orange color emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately. Travers later wrote: \"the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget.\""]}, {"page": "Xenon", "response": ["Xenon was discovered in England by the Scottish chemist William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers in September 1898,"]}, {"page": "1890s", "response": ["* 1896: One year after helium's terrestrial discovery, neon, krypton, and xenon were discovered by William Ramsay and Morris Travers."]}, {"page": "1898", "response": ["* June 7 \u2013 William Ramsay and Morris Travers discover neon at their laboratory at University College London, after extracting it from liquid nitrogen."]}, {"page": "Indian Institute of Science", "response": ["At the time of the inception of IISc in 1909, Morris Travers, Sir William Ramsay's co-worker in the discovery of the noble gases, became its first Director.

In August Ramsay told Rayleigh he had isolated a new, heavy component of air, which did not appear to have any chemical reactivity. He named this inert gas \"argon\", from the Greek word meaning \"lazy\". In the following years, working with Morris Travers, he discovered neon, krypton, and xenon.

In 1884 the college came close to bankruptcy when the treasurer announced that funds would dry up within two months. The college survived, but two professors were given notice of dismissal and their departments were placed on a self-supporting notice. At this time Welsh colleges were able to receive financial support but not English ones, so English colleges therefore decided to lobby the Government for funding. The result was that English colleges would receive a grant of \u00a315000, of which Bristol gained the modest share of \u00a31,200. Ramsay resigned his post in 1887 after being appointed chair of chemistry at University College, London. Although no longer principal, after his resignation he used his influence to lobby the college council to appoint his assistant Morris Travers to the chair of chemistry when the position became vacant. Travers is credited with pushing forward the Charter campaign during the beginning of the 20th century.", "Morris Travers who gained the post of lecture in chemistry at the college is generally credited with pushing forward the campaign to gain a charter by courting the local press and pressing for the support of the Fry brothers who held power on the City power continuously from 1882 and 1909. There is evidence that Marshall had told Travers to reject the compromise idea of a federal university and push for a Bristol university. Travers spoke to Lewis Fry head of the College Council on 1 February 1905 and was able to make Fry write to relatives to increase support. Lewis Fry was able to get the Conservative chairman of the City Education Committee to agree to the idea of setting up a university.

His initial work was to study the manufacture of indigo under chemist Christopher Rawson with the aim to compete with Germany and their synthetic indigo dyes. He worked for eleven years, mostly at the Sirsia indigo research station, Muzzafarpur. The work included attempts to improve the efficiency of extraction of the indigo.
