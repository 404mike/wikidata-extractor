She was a three-time competitor at the IAAF World Race Walking Cup and was twice a silver medallist.\nBorn to Jack and Peggy Tyson, both medical doctors, she attended Keswick School as a boarder and took up racewalking while there.  Women's walking was in its early stages of development and, along with Marion Fawkes, Tyson was a leading athlete for Great Britain. She claimed national titles at the 5 km and 5000 m distances in her early twenties, including two titles at the UK Athletics Championships and four titles across 5000 m and 10,000 m disciplines at the Women's AAA Championships.She began to study medicine at King's College London but continued to compete in the sport. She entered an invitational 5 km women's race at the 1977 IAAF World Race Walking Cup. Contested mainly between British and Swedish athletes, Tyson placed second behind Siv Gustavsson. The event was upgraded to an official one for the 1979 IAAF World Race Walking Cup and Tyson formed a British 1\u20132 with Marion Fawkes, helping the British women to the Eschborn Cup team title. Her third and final outing at the 1981 IAAF World Race Walking Cup brought more modest results, with Tyson in 19th place. She also won the top level Coppa Citt\u00e0 di Sesto San Giovanni race in 1981.After retiring from racewalking due to an Achilles tendon injury, she worked as a paediatrician in New Zealand, London, Great Yarmouth and finally at Perth Royal Infirmary. She died suddenly at the age of 47 after having breathing difficulties. She left a daughter, Tara Flores.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships", "response": ["|Carol Tyson || ", "|Carol Tyson || "]}, {"page": "1981 IAAF World Race Walking Cup", "response": ["|align=center| 19 || Carol Tyson ||  || 25:10.9  "]}, {"page": "1977 IAAF World Race Walking Cup", "response": ["|align=center|  || Carol Tyson ||  || 23:46"]}, {"page": "1979 IAAF World Race Walking Cup", "response": ["|align=center|  || Carol Tyson ||  || 22:59"]}, {"page": "Marion Fawkes", "response": ["The Women's Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA) held walks from 1960 onwards and it was at these events that Fawkes established herself.

The following year she beat Jenkins on the track by over half a minute and retained her road walk title. She dropped back down the order in 1975, being runner-up to Ginney Lovell in the 5000\u00a0m walk and losing to Judy Farr at the road event. In 1976 she was reduced to third behind Farr and Carol Tyson. She began to perform better on the track, including three WAAA wins over 5000\u00a0m between 1976 and 1979, as well as a win over 10,000\u00a0m in 1979.
