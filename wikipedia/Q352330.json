A run of nine consecutive matches without a win saw York drop out of promotion contention, and they finished 11th. That season's FA Cup run included a 2\u20131 win over a Swansea Town team featuring eight Wales internationals at Vetch Field in the third round.

During this season, York filled the managerial position that had been vacant for the last 18 months; Arsenal player Don Roper rejected the job before Sam Bartram was appointed in March 1956. Bartram, a former Charlton Athletic player, was a popular choice, having been a favourite with the fans while playing for the club during the war. York invested heavily in transfers for 1956\u201357, spending \u00a312,000 on fees\u2014a sizeable amount at that time. The aim was promotion to the Second Division, but the team failed to make the intended impact and finished in seventh place. The 1957\u201358 season was the last of regionalised football; the top 12 clubs in the North and South sections would form the new Third Division, and the bottom clubs would become founder members of the Fourth Division. York went into the Easter period third from bottom, but after 7 wins and 3 draws in their last 10 matches they missed out on a top-12 position on goal average. York led the Fourth Division until early November 1958, and despite faltering midseason continued strongly to finish third in 1958\u201359 and gain promotion for the first time.

Intent on playing an expansive style of football, he purchased Don Roper and converted Ian McPherson's position from defender to winger. The changes had the desired effect as Arsenal won the 1947\u201348 First Division championship. Whittaker won the club's third FA Cup in 1950 and repeated early league success in 1952\u201353. The club's success began to wane after this, which in turn commenced a stressful period for Whittaker. In October 1956 he died of a heart attack, aged 58.
