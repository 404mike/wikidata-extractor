He is known chiefly for his encyclopedic work, the Compendium of Medicine (Compendium Medicin\u00e6), most probably written between 1230 and 1250. This medical treatise was an attempt at a comprehensive overview of the best practice in pharmacology, medicine, and surgery at the time. His medical works, alongside those of John of Gaddesden, \"formed part of the core curriculum that underpinned the practice of medicine for the next 400 years\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bartholomeus Anglicus", "response": ["*Gilbertus Anglicus An English physician in France; wrote COMPENDIUM MEDICINAE."]}, {"page": "Trotula", "response": ["Medieval readers of the Trotula texts would have had no reason to doubt the attribution they found in the manuscripts, and so \"Trotula\" (assuming they understood the word as a personal name instead of a title) was accepted as an authority on women's medicine. The physician Petrus Hispanus (mid-13th century), for example, cited \"domina Trotula\" (Lady Trotula) multiple times in his section on women's gynecological and obstetrical conditions. The Amiens chancellor, poet, and physician, Richard de Fournival (d. 1260), commissioned a copy headed \"Incipit liber Trotule sanatricis Salernitane de curis mulierum\" (\"Here begins the book of Trotula, the Salernitan female healer, on treatments for women\").Monica H.

Two copies of the Latin Trotula ensemble include imaginative portrayals of the author; the pen-and-ink wash image found in an early 14th-century manuscript now held by the Wellcome Library is the most well-known image of \"Trotula\" (see image above).The other image is an historiated initial that opens the copy of the intermediate ensemble in Florence, Biblioteca Laurenziana, Plut. 73, cod. 37, 13th-century (Italy), ff. 2r-41r:  http://www.bml.firenze.sbn.it/Diaita/schede/scheda15.htm.

Green, Making Women\u2019s Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 84-85. The belief that \"Trotula\" was the ultimate authority on the topic of women's medicine even caused works authored by others to be attributed to her, such as a 15th-century Middle English compendium on gynecology and obstetrics based on the works of the male authors Gilbertus Anglicus and Muscio, which in one of its four extant copies was called the Liber Trotularis.Monica H.

It is crammed with quotations from Galen, Pedanius Dioscorides, Rufus of Ephesus, Haliabbas, Serapion, Al Rhazis, Avicenna, Averroes, John of Damascus, Isaac, Masawaiyh, Gilbertus Anglicus, and from the Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum; but also contains a good many original remarks which illustrate the character of the author more than his medical knowledge. The book begins with an account of fevers based on Galen's arrangement, then goes through diseases and injuries beginning with the head, and ends with an antidotarium (a treatise on remedies). It contains some remarks on cooking, and innumerable prescriptions, many of which are superstitious, while others prove to be common-sense remedies when carefully considered. He cared for his gains, and boasts of getting a large price from the Barber Surgeons' guild for a prescription of which the chief ingredient is tree frogs (Rosa, ed. Pavia, p.\u00a0120). His disposition, his peculiarities, and his reading are so precisely those of the \"Doctour of Phisik\" in Geoffrey Chaucer's prologue that it seems possible that Gaddesden is the contemporary from whom Chaucer drew this character."]}, {"page": "Gilbert the Englishman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gilbertus Anglicus"]}, {"page": "Gilbert Anglicus", "response": ["#REDIRECTGilbertus Anglicus"]}, {"page": "Joseph Frank Payne", "response": ["In 1903 and 1904 Payne delivered the first FitzPatrick lectures on the history of medicine at the College of Physicians.
