He was born in Greenwich in Kent in 1829 and played for Kent County Cricket Club between 1852 and 1872, initially as a wicket-keeper and later as a batsman.Fryer made his first-class cricket debut for Kent in July 1852 against Sussex. He played 75 times for Kent as well as making appearances for a range of other teams, including the Gentlemen of Kent three times and one appearance for an England side in 1855.After losing an eye in an accident where he was thrown from a trap in 1862, Fryer continued to play cricket although he no longer kept wicket on a regular basis. He was described in his Wisden obituary as a \"free and hard-hitting batsman and an excellent wicket-keeper\" who was \"also useful as a change-bowler\". He took 8/40 for Kent against an England side at Lord's in 1864, the best bowling figures of his first-class career. He continued playing county cricket until 1872 when he made his final first-class appearance for Kent and continued playing for Mote Park until 1879.He went on to be an \"excellent\" umpire and was considered \"in every way a worthy man\" by Wisden. he died at Loose near Maidstone in Kent in 1919 aged 89.", "link_mentions": {}}}
