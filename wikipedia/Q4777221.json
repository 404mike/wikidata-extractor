The storyline was set when Johnston was brought in to write the script, though he remained in contact with the team about potential changes and made smaller additions of his own. In contrast to the isolated character views of the comic, the game featured a group cast dynamic. Senior designer John Calhoun estimated that there was five times more spoken dialogue than in the original game. The heavily-scripted style of the game allowed the team to deliver the narrative and additional story material within environments at a better pace, ensuring players would not run into a battle and be fighting over dialogue and video logs. The team chose to open with the extraction of the Marker, which acted as a point where the colony's deterioration begins in earnest. The first-person perspective, Wii hardware and switch between different characters allowed the developers to show more of the Marker's mental impacts, including visual and auditory hallucinations. The scenario team deviated as little as possible from pre-established events in the expanded media the game took place around.
