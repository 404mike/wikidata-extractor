He composed an ode to Llywelyn the Great celebrating his battles and victory over King John of England, and wrote an elegy to Llywelyn's son and successor as prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, on his death in 1246.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh-language poets (6th century to c. 1600)", "response": ["*Dafydd Benfras (fl. 1230\u20131260)", "  from:  1230 till: 1260 color:PA text:\"Dafydd Benfras(1230\u20131260)\""]}, {"page": "Y Gododdin", "response": ["There are a number of references to Y Gododdin in later Medieval Welsh poetry. The well-known 12th-century poem Hirlas Owain by Owain Cyfeiliog, in which Owain praises his own war-band, likens them to the heroes of the Gododdin and uses Y Gododdin as a model. A slightly later poet, Dafydd Benfras, in a eulogy addressed to Llywelyn the Great, wishes to be inspired \"to sing as Aneirin sang / The day he sang the Gododdin\". After this period this poetry seems to have been forgotten in Wales for centuries until Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd) discovered the manuscript in the late 18th century.

At the end of the ode, which praises Llywelyn as 'king of the Welsh' (), the poet declaims \"Whatever is prophesied about you you shall take, / From every prophetic song you shall be blessed, / That which I have prophesied you shall possess, / Whatever I should prophesise you shall uphold, / You are the son of the prophecy in the eyes of all whom you see (about you)!'.N.

The truce remained in effect throughout the winter, but the war was effectively ended by the sudden death of Dafydd in the royal home at Abergwyngregyn, in February 1246. He was buried with his father at the abbey of Aberconwy. The writer of Brut y Tywysogyon described him as tarian Cymru - the shield of Wales.
