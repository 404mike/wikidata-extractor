He was born in Bristol, where his father James Macready Chute (1856\u20131912) ran the dynastic family theatre.  He was educated at Downside School, and the Slade Art School in London.He was an intimate and influential friend of Stanley Spencer, from 1915.From 1918 became a close colleague, assistant and \"beloved brother\" of Eric Gill and was co-founder of The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, publishing poetry in The Game, the community's magazine. His mother, Abigail Philomena, n\u00e9e Hennessy (1855\u20131931), was a principal patron of the Guild in its early days.\nHe became a convinced distributist and follower of Vincent McNabb, to whom he and Eric Gill were introduced in 1914 by the influential same-sex couple Marc-Andre Raffalovich and John Gray.  He started in 1921 to study for the priesthood, in Fribourg.Later Desmond moved for his health to Rapallo, Italy, where he was a close friend of Max Beerbohm and Ezra Pound, and one of the Tigullian Circle clique around him.  He tutored Mary de Rachewiltz, Pound's daughter with Olga Rudge, and supported both of them when Pound was arrested and deported by the US army.  During the war, Desmond was interned  at Bobbio, where he taught English to the local boys, and where he remained until the end of the war.\nHis radio play Poets in Paradise was broadcast by the BBC in 1955.He died and was buried in Rapallo, although a memorial designed by Gill stands in Canford Cemetery, Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol.\nSome of his papers are held in the Eric Gill Collection at Chichester, and others by his relation, David Charles Manners.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antonio Vivaldi", "response": ["In the early 20th century, Fritz Kreisler's Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. Kreisler's concerto in C spurred the French scholar Marc Pincherle to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, which were acquired by the Turin National University Library as a result of the generous sponsorship of Turinese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons. This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, Alfredo Casella, Ezra Pound, Olga Rudge, Desmond Chute, Arturo Toscanini, Arnold Schering and Louis Kaufman, all of whom were instrumental in the revival of Vivaldi throughout the 20th century."]}, {"page": "David Jones (artist-poet)", "response": ["In 1919 Jones won a government grant to return at Camberwell Art School. From Camberwell, he followed its headmaster, Walter Bayes, to the Westminster School of Art in central London, where he studied under him and with Bernard Meninsky, and was influenced by Walter Sickert, an occasional lecturer there, whom he came to know personally. Jones received instruction towards becoming a Catholic from Fr. John O'Connor, who suggested Jones visit Eric Gill and his guild of Catholic craftsmen at Ditchling in Sussex. Influenced by Gill, Jones entered the Catholic Church in 1921, chiefly, he said, because it seemed \"real\" in contrast to Christian alternatives. He also liked the Church's continuity with Classical antiquity. In 1922 he increasingly spent time at Ditchling, apprenticed as a carpenter but never becoming a full member of Gill's Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic. Having shown himself an incompetent carpenter, Jones turned to wood-engraving, whose rudiments Desmond Chute had taught him. In 1923 Jones worked as an illustrator, for The Game published by Gill and Hilary Pepler. He also engraved original work for Pepler's St. Dominic's Press, including The Rosary Book. When Gill moved to Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains of South Wales in 1923, Jones returned to London, but often visited Gill there and also the Benedictines on Caldey Island, near Tenby.

From 1920 Cribb also started taking on his own commissions, also initially making war memorials. His first large sculptural commission was a crucifix for the war memorial at Downside Abbey. When Gill left the Guild and moved first to Wales and later to Buckinghamshire, Joseph's brother went with him and took over Joseph's role as Gill's lead assistant. Joseph remained at the Guild and took over Gill's workshop, establishing his own practice as a sculptor, carver and letter cutter. He continued to do occasional work for Gill, helping him with some of his major sculpture, for example on the monumental sculpture Mankind that is now in the Tate, and cutting letters to Gill's designs."]}]}}
