He was to remain at Anfield for seven years, but could never rise above reserve level. He was very successful in the reserve team, however, captaining the side for many years, as it won five Central League titles, and three Liverpool Senior Cups. He could never break into the first-team, however, only making four appearances before departing in 1980. He then signed for Wigan Athletic, but was released after one year, dropping into non league football with Burscough and Barrow. He later moved into management, taking charge of South Liverpool, Southport, Stalybridge Celtic and Rhyl. In July 2010 Kettle joined A.F.C. Liverpool as assistant reserve team manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southport F.C.", "response": ["After several seasons with South Liverpool, Brian Kettle was appointed manager and was instrumental in one of the most successful periods. Kettle had a difficult task from the off, his first season in charge saw him start with only three players Andy Johnston, Stuart Bimson and club captain Rob Sturgeon. After a poor start to the season which saw the club in the relegation places until mid-October after bringing in several new players such as Ossie Smith, Bob Howard, Steve Whitehall, Steve Holden, Peter Wright, Alan McDonald, the returning Ian Baines and for the third time Tony Quinn they finished the season in a very respectable seventh place in the Northern Premier League, albeit 38 points off the champions Colne Dynamoes who were not accepted for promotion and ultimately folded."]}, {"page": "Dallas Tornado", "response": ["* Brian Kettle (1978) "]}]}}
