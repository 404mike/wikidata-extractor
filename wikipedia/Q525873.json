He also played scrum-half on occasion. Williams is the record try scorer for Wales, and is fourth on the international list of leading rugby union test try scorers behind Daisuke Ohata, Bryan Habana and David Campese. He is Wales's most capped winger and is considered to be one of the greatest wingers of all time.In 2008, Williams was selected as the World Rugby Player of the Year, then known as the IRB Player of the Year.Since his retirement from international rugby in 2012, Williams has worked as a presenter on S4C's Six Nations rugby programme Y Clwb Rygbi Rhyngwladol, and as a pundit on BBC, ITV and Channel 4 broadcasts as well as third party shows such as \"Inside Welsh Rugby\", commenting on the grassroots of Welsh rugby. Williams was selected to the Barbarians squad that played Wales in June 2012. It was originally planned to be his last appearance as a player, but he shortly thereafter signed a one-year contract to play in Japan with Mitsubishi Sagamihara DynaBoars in June 2012. Williams was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to rugby.\nWilliams extended his stay in Japan several times, taking on a role as player-coach and turning down an offer from French Top 14 side Toulon in the process. Before finally announcing he would be returning home at the end of the 2014\u201315 Japanese Top League season.In November 2016, Williams was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame during opening ceremonies for the Hall's first physical home in Rugby, Warwickshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 26", "response": ["*  1977   \u2013 Shane Williams, Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Six Nations Championship", "response": ["| Shane Williams"]}, {"page": "1977", "response": ["* February 26 \u2013 Shane Williams, Welsh rugby player"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Shane Williams \u2013 BBC Sport 2012\u2013present, Talksport 2013, BT Sport 2015\u2013present, ITV Sport 2015\u2013present, Channel 4 2018 \u2013 present, Premier Sports 2018\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Glanamman", "response": ["Garnant Park (formerly Cwmamman Recreation Ground) was part of Lord Dynevor's Glanrafon Farm estate just east of Glanamman.

The try and Hodgson's conversion gave the Lions a solid, though far from insurmountable, lead. Otago rallied to 20\u201319 with a penalty, but the Lions pulled away soon afterwards.

Welshman Shane Williams scored five tries to help the Lions post their all-time record score in New Zealand, surpassing their 64\u20135 victory over Marlborough/Nelson 46 years earlier. In addition to Williams' five, the Lions' tries were scored by Ronan O'Gara (2), Mark Cueto (2), Geordan Murphy, Charlie Hodgson, Jason Robinson, Martin Corry, Neil Back, Gareth Cooper, Gordon D'Arcy and Ollie Smith, with Manawatu restricted to two Jonathan Hargreaves penalties. Lock Donncha O'Callaghan and flanker Martyn Williams were substituted at half-time but had impressed enough to secure Test selection for the following Saturday. Murphy also impressed at full-back, but it was Shane Williams, with elusive running and awareness, who most thrilled Lions supporters."]}, {"page": "Ospreys (rugby union)", "response": ["On 21 April 2009, the Ospreys had six players included in the British & Irish Lions' squad for the 2009 South African tour: Lee Byrne (fullback), Tommy Bowe and Shane Williams (wings), Mike Phillips (scrum-half), Alun Wyn Jones (lock) and Adam Jones (prop).
