He famously brought Brian Clough to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player Alan Mullery as manager. Brighton's life as a Football League club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over Arsenal and Manchester United mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. Jimmy Melia took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.", "*  Jimmy Melia 1982\u20131983"]}, {"page": "Bill Shankly", "response": ["The two Scottish players were centre half Ron Yeats and centre forward Ian St John from Dundee United and Motherwell respectively.Kelly, pp. 160\u2013165.
