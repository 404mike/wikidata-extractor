One of his best-known covers was for Mike Oldfield's 1973 debut album Tubular Bells. Other artists that he produced cover artwork for include Joy Division, the Sex Pistols, Phil Collins, Roxy Music, Wham!, Can, China Crisis, System 7, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and New Order.\nKey was also involved in logo design and was credited with designing the Virgin Group signature logo with Ray Kyte. Key was also associated with Peter Saville and Factory Records.\nKey was married to Lesley and they had one daughter, Letty. He died of a brain tumour in December 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tubular Bells", "response": ["The cover of Tubular Bells was created by designer and photographer Trevor Key, who was suggested by Sue Steward, a press officer at Virgin Records at the time. Key was invited to present his portfolio, and one of his designs depicted a boiled egg with blood dripping from it, which Branson liked and wanted to use for the cover because he wanted to call the album Breakfast in Bed. Oldfield hated both the image and the title and rejected them. A modified version of the image, with the blood replaced by egg yolk, was used as the cover for Heaven's Open (1991), Oldfield's final album for Virgin.", "*Trevor Key \u2013 artwork"]}, {"page": "Tubular Bells II", "response": ["Tubular Bells II again uses the bent metallic tube (representing a bent tubular bell) as the focus of the album artwork.

Gabriel has noted his dislike for titling albums, mainly because it distracts from the sleeve design. In an interview for Rolling Stone, he explained that his American label Geffen Records refused to release Peter Gabriel IV until it was retitled Security. He elaborated that for So \"[he] decided to go for the anti-title\u00a0... It can be more a piece of graphic, if you like, as opposed to something with meaning and intention. And that's what I've done ever since\". When the album was profiled in the Classic Albums documentary series, Gabriel quipped that its short title meant it could be enlarged and useful when marketing it. Before the album was eventually named So, it was meant to be entitled Good. The album's cover is a portrait of Gabriel photographed by Trevor Key, who was then most famous for capturing the bell artwork for Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (1973). The sleeve was designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens; Saville was best known for designing several sleeves for Factory Records artists and was paid \u00a320,000 for his work on So. Gabriel recalled: \"The only compromise I made was to go with Peter Saville's idea for a retro-style portrait. I was told my usual obscure LP sleeves alienated women.\" The cover was partly influenced by photographer David Bailey's work."]}, {"page": "...But Seriously", "response": ["* Trevor Key \u2013 photography"]}, {"page": "Both Sides", "response": ["* Cover photography by Trevor Key"]}, {"page": "Hergest Ridge (album)", "response": ["Hergest Ridge on the England\u2013Wales border is a popular holiday destination for Oldfield's fans, and the house where he lived at the time, The Beacon, is now a guest house.

The front photograph was taken at Cala Pregonda beach on the Spanish island of Menorca. It is unclear whether Oldfield was actually on the beach at the time it was taken, though it is possible from looking at other photographs from the shoot. It is assumed that Key cut and pasted the image of Oldfield onto a slightly different background for artistic reasons. Early pressings of the LP included a poster showing a subtly different photograph from the one used on the cover.
