As David Smith described it: \"Notwithstanding the personal qualities of the appointees, which have often been extraordinary, the Canadian governor general has become a hermetic head of state\u2014ignored by press, politicians and public.\" It was theorized by Peter Boyce that this was due, in part, to widespread misunderstanding about the governor general's role coupled with a lack of public presence compared to the media coverage dedicated to the increasingly presidentialized prime minister."]}, {"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["The series which centres on the character of Geraldine Granger, the new vicar of the village of Dibley,  almost immediately exploited the 1992 changes in the Church of England that permitted the ordination of women.
