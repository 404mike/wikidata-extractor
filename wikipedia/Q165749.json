Hofmann's researches on rosaniline, which he first prepared in 1858, were the beginning of a series of investigations on colouring matter.

In 1864, Hofmann confirmed that magenta can only be made by oxidation of commercial aniline in which isomeric orthotoluidine and paratoluidine are present as impurities, not from pure aniline.
