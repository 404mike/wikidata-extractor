After relocating from New England to London, England, in 1650, Starkey began writing under the pseudonym Eirenaeus Philalethes. Starkey remained in England and continued his career in medicine and alchemy until his death in the Great Plague of London in 1665.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1677 in literature", "response": ["*Eirenaeus Philalethes \u2013 An Exposition upon Sir George Ripley's Vision."]}, {"page": "George Ripley (alchemist)", "response": ["A commentary upon Ripley's works was written in a series of treatises by the English alchemist Eirenaeus Philalethes.

Liddell & R. Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), 1924, p. 1931 One of the early uses of the word was as part of a \"nome de plume\" of Eirenaeus Philalethes (the peaceful lover of truth) who was a 17th-century alchemist and the author of many influential works. The word came into Masonic circles through alchemical mystic Robert Samber (1682\u20131745), who used the pseudonym Eugenius Philalethes; Samber's use, in turn, was an homage to Thomas Vaughan, an earlier alchemist who had used the same name. Finally, a Rite of Philal\u00e9thes was founded in Paris in 1772, devoted to the study of esotericism.Kenneth Mackenzie, The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia (London: J.W.

In the 17th century, a number of writers stated that Child was Eirenaeus Philalethes, the pseudonymous alchemist. That view was circulated by Johann Ferdinand Hertodt, among others.\u2013 It was incorrect, since the pseudonym concealed in fact his associate George Starkey from Massachusetts Bay Colony. Child, along with Benjamin Worsley, also took an interest in the chemical work of Johann Glauber."]}]}}
