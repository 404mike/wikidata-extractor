Many of his plays were staged at the Citizens Theatre between 1943 and 1960. Tony Paterson has argued that Bridie's output set the tone for Scottish Theatre until the early Nineteen-Sixties and gave encouragement to other Scottish dramatists such as Robert Kemp, Alexander Reid and George Munro.Paterson, Tony (1981), Four Decades of Drama, in Murray, Glen (ed.), Cencrastus No. 7, Winter 1981 - 82, pp. 43 & 44.,  Alan Riach described (in 2021) Bridie's plays as both serious and offering  'high spirited fun'; both contemporarily 'commercially successful' and yet 'perennially provocative'; raising open questions that Riach considers as Brechtian. He admires the quality of writing in Bridie's 1939 autobiography 'One Way of Living', calling it a 'modern classic'.", "*Tobias and the Angel (1930)Kenneth Hardacre (1960) James Bridie's \"Tobias and the Angel\" (Chosen Eng.
