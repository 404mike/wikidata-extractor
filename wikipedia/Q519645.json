The translation was frequently reprinted in the United States of America. The legislatures of New Jersey and Massachusetts distributed it in the schools at the expense of the states. Cousin remarks that, among all the literary distinctions which he had received, \"None has touched me more than the title of foreign member of the American Institute for Education.\" To the enlightened views of the ministries of Guizot and Thiers under the citizen-king, and to the zeal and ability of Cousin in the work of organization, France owes what is best in her system of primary education,a national interest which had been neglected under the French Revolution, the Empire and the Restoration (see Expos\u00e9, p.\u00a017). In the first two years of the reign of Louis Philippe more was done for the education of the people than had been either sought or accomplished in all the history of France. In defence of university studies he stood manfully forth in the chamber of peers in 1844, against the clerical party on the one hand and the levelling or Philistine party on the other. His speeches on this occasion were published in a tractate D\u00e9fense de l'universit\u00e9 et de la philosophie (1844 and 1845)."]}, {"page": "1867 in literature", "response": ["*August 8 \u2013 Sarah Austin, English editor and translator (born 1793)"]}, {"page": "1863 in literature", "response": ["*John Austin (posthumously, compiled by Sarah Austin) \u2013 Lectures on Jurisprudence"]}, {"page": "Harriet Martineau", "response": ["In November 1832 Martineau moved to London.
