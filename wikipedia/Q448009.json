Despite scoring three tries in the second test at Durban, the Springboks suffered from some woeful goal kicking and failed to land any penalties or conversions, while for the Lions Neil Jenkins once again kicked five penalties to level the scores at 15\u201315 before Jeremy Guscott dropped a goal for an 18\u201315 lead for the Lions. The Lions then held off a ferocious South African fightback, Lawrence Dallaglio putting in a try-saving tackle, to win the match 18\u201315 and take the series.

After this, the 1983 season was a disappointment; losing their first three Five Nations matches.
