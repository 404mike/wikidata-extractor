The specific epithet interruptus refers to the grooves on the abdominal tergites, which are interrupted in this species.

A. (1837). Histoire naturelle des insectes. Apt\u00e8res. Paris 1, 1-682. This was one of the earliest description of a species of spider in New Zealand. In 1849, Adam White described two species of Mygale (Ctenzia) that were endemic to New Zealand. These were Mygale (Ctenzia) antipodium and Mygale (Ctenzia) hexops. White noted that Mygale hexops had only six eyes, rather than eight, which is typical for Porrhothele antipodiana.White, A. (1849). Descriptions of apparently new species of Aptera from New Zealand. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 17: 3-6. (reprinted in Ann. Mag. nat. Hist. (2) 5: 50-53, 1850) It is not known if this is a mistake or not. In the same year, Mygale quoyi was described by Hippolyte Lucas, named after the collector of the specimen used for description.Lucas, H. (1849b). Articles sur les araign\u00e9es. In: Dictionaire Universel d'Histoire Naturelle. Paris. In 1871 Mygale (Ctenzia) hexops was moved to the Hexops genus and subsequently named \u201cHexops whitei\u201d by Anton Ausserer. The creation of this genus was done on the basis that Mygale (Ctenzia) hexops was described as having only six eyes, which is unique among other specimens of Mygalomorphae in the area.Ausserer, A.
