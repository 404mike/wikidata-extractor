He was an Amateur Boxing Association Champion, Inter-Services Champion, and British Army Champion in 1953. He began fighting as a professional in 1954 and was trained by Freddie Elvin. He held the British heavyweight title from August 1956 to June 1958. In all, he won 45 of his 54 professional bouts, losing 8, with one drawn. His best wins were against George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Dick Richardson, Uli Ritter, Jack Bodell, Johnny Williams, Joe Bygraves and Willie Pastrano.\nErskine was a small heavyweight who outmaneuvered rather than overpowered his opponents. Angelo Dundee who saw his prospect Pastrano defeated by Erskine said he was surprised by his skill \u2013 further remarking that if Erskine had been just a bit bigger he could have been a world beater.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 2", "response": ["*  1990   \u2013 Joe Erskine, Welsh boxer (b. 1934)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Joe Erskine (1934\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "George Chuvalo", "response": ["|align=left| Joe Erskine"]}, {"page": "Henry Cooper", "response": ["Henry and his identical twin brother, George (boxing under the name Jim) turned professional together under the management of Jim Wicks.
