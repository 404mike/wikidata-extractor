The company, often described as \"punk theatre\" (a label which Ward rejects), was distinguished by its mixing of professionally-trained actors with musicians (often from punk bands) and other non-professional artistes. According to Ward, \"We began to recruit from bands and chance encounters at gigs, squats, anarchy centres, and sometimes even from casual conversations in the street.\" The ethos was collaborative and similar to guerilla theater. Ward chose to recruit these inexperienced actors as he found that trained actors had difficulty expressing the raw emotion of his work. One reviewer described a performance as \"rough, angry, unsubtle\" as well as \"not for the squeamish (nor for perfectionists).\" In Demonstration of Affection, the actors smashed real chairs and bottles onstage, a theme which was repeated in Plastic Zion. Another play closed abruptly when its assistant director threatened the audience with a knife. Amongst the performers who passed through the ranks of Wet Paint were Jobson, Bane, Simon Tedd (Simon Scardanelli), Beki Bondage, Max Splodge, Michelle Brigandage, George Cheex (from !Action Pact!), Ruth Radish (from Hagar the Womb), and Jenny Runacre."]}, {"page": "Disorder (band)", "response": ["Disorder formed in 1980 in Bristol.Glasper, Ian (2004) Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980\u20131984, Cherry Red Books, Thompson, Dave (2000) Alternative Rock, Miller Freeman Books, Strong, Martin C.
