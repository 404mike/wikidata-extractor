After his many encounters with political philosophers in England, France and across Europe, Mazzini had decided that the principle of equality between men and women was fundamental to building a truly democratic Italian nation. He called for the end of women's social and judicial subordination to men. Mazzini's vigorous position heightened attention to gender among European thinkers who were already considering democracy and nationalism. He helped intellectuals see women's rights not merely as a peripheral topic, but rather as a fundamental goal necessary for the regeneration of old nations and the rebirth of new ones.Falchi, Federica (2012). \"Democrazia e questione femminile nel pensiero di Giuseppe Mazzini\" [\"Democracy and the Rights of Women in the Thinking of Giuseppe Mazzini\"].
