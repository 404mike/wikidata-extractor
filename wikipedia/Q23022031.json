He played primarily for Kent County Cricket Club. He was born in Beckenham, then part of Kent, in 1901.Hilder was educated at Cottesmore School and Lancing College. He played cricket for both, heading the batting averages for Lancing in 1920, and played for Kent's Second XI later the same year for the first time.He made his first-class cricket debut for Kent in June 1924 against Essex at Gravesend. He scored a century in Kent's second innings of the match and set a Kent record for the 8th wicket in first-class cricket which stood until 2007, scoring 157 runs in partnership with Charlie Wright. This was Hilder's only century of his career and he was considered to have \"never afterwards approached that form\". He played 14 times for Kent, his final match coming in 1929.Hilder toured Jamaica in 1926/27 and 1927/28 with teams led by Lionel Tennyson, playing eight first-class matches, and in 1928/29 in a non-first-class team led by Julien Cahn. He played his final first-class match in 1930, his only one for MCC, but continued to play cricket for various amateur teams until after World War II, including touring Egypt in 1932 in a team led by Hubert Martineau.He died at St Leonards-on-Sea in Hastings, East Sussex in 1970 aged 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hilder", "response": ["*Alan Hilder (1901\u20131970), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Charlie Wright (Kent cricketer)", "response": ["Wright and George Collins provided the seam bowling alternative to the spin of Tich Freeman and Frank Woolley which dominated Kent's bowling across the 1920s. Both his best batting and bowling performances came in the 1924 season, relatively early in his first-class career. Against Essex in June 1924 in the second innings he scored 81, putting on 157 in about 75 minutes for the eighth wicket with the debutant Alan Hilder, which stood as the Kent record for that wicket until 2007. In August of the same year, he took five Somerset wickets for 33 runs in the first innings and followed that with seven for 31 in the second innings, providing both his best innings and match figures. In 1925, in the match against Warwickshire, Wright was the first victim in a sequence of four wickets in five balls by the Warwickshire player Robert Cooke; in Warwickshire's second innings, Wright returned the favour with a hat-trick in which Cooke was one of his victims."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Alan Hilder (1930) : A.
