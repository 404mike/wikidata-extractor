However, his career had just got underway when he had a career-threatening leg fracture during a game. It was 18 months before he resumed his career \u2013 and less than a year later, the Second World War broke out. He played a total of 112 league games for Leeds, scoring 25 goals.\nPowell continued playing for the Leeds United throughout the war in the Wartime League, as well as playing for Wales during this time. He played 123 times in Wartime League games, scoring 37 goals, and scored 1 goal in 3 appearances in the Football League War Cup for Leeds. Powell was second only to Gerry Henry in wartime appearances for the club by an individual player. Wartime appearances and goals are typically not acknowledged as counting for career goals and appearance. Powell is one of only 66 players that have made over 200 appearances for Leeds United if his wartime games are taken into account.\nPowell joined Everton in 1948 for \u00a310,000, a club record fee at the time. He spent two seasons at Goodison, before finishing his career with a season at Birmingham City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Halton Moor", "response": ["The former Wales international footballer Aubrey Powell, who also played for Leeds United, Everton and Birmingham City lived for many years in Halton Moor following his retirement from football."]}, {"page": "2009 in association football", "response": ["* 27 January \u2013 Aubrey Powell (90), Welsh forward"]}, {"page": "Aubrey Powell", "response": ["Aubrey Powell may refer to:", "*Aubrey Powell (designer) (born 1946), English graphic designer", "*Aubrey Powell (footballer) (1918\u20132009), Welsh football player"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 in English football", "response": ["*27 January 2009 \u2013 Aubrey Powell, 90, former Welsh international inside-forward who spent the majority of his club career at Leeds United, and also had spells at Everton and Birmingham City.Former Leeds United star dies Yorkshire Evening Post.
