However, his career had just got underway when he had a career-threatening leg fracture during a game. It was 18 months before he resumed his career \u2013 and less than a year later, the Second World War broke out. He played a total of 112 league games for Leeds, scoring 25 goals.\nPowell continued playing for the Leeds United throughout the war in the Wartime League, as well as playing for Wales during this time. He played 123 times in Wartime League games, scoring 37 goals, and scored 1 goal in 3 appearances in the Football League War Cup for Leeds. Powell was second only to Gerry Henry in wartime appearances for the club by an individual player. Wartime appearances and goals are typically not acknowledged as counting for career goals and appearance. Powell is one of only 66 players that have made over 200 appearances for Leeds United if his wartime games are taken into account.\nPowell joined Everton in 1948 for \u00a310,000, a club record fee at the time. He spent two seasons at Goodison, before finishing his career with a season at Birmingham City.", "link_mentions": {}}}
