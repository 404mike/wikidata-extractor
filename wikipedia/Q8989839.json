He started the season well, setting up the equalising goal for Chris Hargreaves in a 1\u20131 draw against Grimsby Town in the opening game of the season. A week later on 13 August 2006, Hackett scored his first goal of the season, as well as setting up a goal for Danny Morgan, in a 2\u20132 draw against Wycombe Wanderers. His second goal of the season then came on 13 September 2005, in a 1\u20131 draw against Bristol Rovers. Hackett appeared in every match from the start of the season until a calf injury at the end of September. He returned from injury on 7 October 2005 in a 1\u20130 win over Carlisle United. He was again suspended for three matches after being sent off for a dangerous two-footed challenge on Andy Parkinson, in a 3\u20132 loss against Grimsby Town on 25 November 2005. He returned from suspension on 13 December 2005, starting as Oxford United lost 2\u20131 to Cheltenham Town in an FA Cup second-round replay. In his final season for Oxford, he made 27 appearances scoring twice in league matches."]}, {"page": "Daniel Morgan (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Danny Morgan (footballer, born 1984), English football player", "*Danny Morgan (boxer) (born 1961), retired professional super middleweight boxer from Minneapolis, Minnesota", "*Danny Morgan (politician) (born 1972), Democratic politician from Oklahoma", "*Danny Morgan (Australian footballer) (born 1974), former Australian rules footballer"]}]}}
