The ball was then worked back to Fred Birt, standing within range in front of the posts, and he kicked a drop-goal, putting the home side 4\u20130 ahead at the break. In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence kept them from crossing the line, although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored again through a cross-kick from Wetter, which Birt jumped on over the line for a try, which he then converted."]}, {"page": "Jack Gore", "response": ["Gore played all his rugby union for the unfashionable lower level club Blaina, though during this period the Welsh selectors would often choose tough manual workers to represent the forward positions. Gore first represented Wales in the 1924 Five Nations Championship in a match at the Cardiff Arms Park against Ireland. Under the captaincy of Jack Wetter, Gore found himself on the losing team which stopped a run of 9 successive home wins for Wales. His second game was against France and although a win for Wales, it was a poor Welsh performance caused by players being thrown out of position by the selectors decision to suspend Ossie Male on the trip to Paris. Gore was selected later in the year to face the touring New Zealand team. Wales were totally outclassed by the All Blacks, though the forwards put on a spirited display.Billot (1972), pg 68."]}, {"page": "Douglas Marsden-Jones", "response": ["Marsden-Jones was born in Swansea and played in his early life for University College, Swansea.

Marsden-Jones was one of seven new caps to play under the captaincy of Jack Wetter at Twickenham, and after a string of serious injuries, Wales lost the game 18\u20133.

Under the captaincy of Jack Wetter, Wales were outclassed by the All Black's speed and combination play. Parker worked tirelessly in the packBillot (1972), p. 68. along with Steve Morris and Charlie Pugh, but were let down by uninspiring back play.

The team beat Ireland and France, and it was only a draw with Scotland that prevented the team taking the Grand Slam title. Hiddlestone was replaced in the 1923 Championship by Gwilym Michael, but at the end of the 1924 season he was reselected for the Welsh team to face the touring New Zealanders. Although not selected as captain of the Welsh team, Hiddlestone decided to lead the team in a response to the All Black's Haka, similar to Teddy Morgan leading the national anthem in 1905. Hiddlestone chose to lead the Welsh team in a responsive \"War-dance\", which was seen as offensive and mocking towards the New Zealand team. During the game the Wales captain, Jack Wetter, took a heavy blow from George N\u0113pia and was forced to play the end of the game, out of position, in the pack. Hiddlestone was pushed out as an extra-back to cover his captain. New Zealand outclassed the Welsh team, winning 19-0, and Hiddlestone never represented Wales again."]}, {"page": "Eddie Dowdall", "response": ["Edward \"Eddie\" George Dowdall ( \u2013 ) was a Welsh rugby union, and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s and 1930s.
