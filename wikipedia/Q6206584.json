He studied at Leeds College of Art, and from 1950 to 1953 at the Royal College of Art, where his contemporaries included Peter Blake and Frank Auerbach.\nShortly after graduating, Woodrow became ill and returned to his parents' home in Chapel Allerton, where he would remain for much of his life. From this time onwards, and virtually unknown to the wider art establishment, he painted prolifically: over seven hundred paintings, including numerous large works and 3,500 drawings and sketches. In 2000 he became too ill to cope with living on his own and was moved to sheltered accommodation.\nAs part of a clearance of the artist's house, his extensive collection of art books were bought by a local bookshop. Nine of the books contained drawings by Woodrow and these were discovered by the Leeds artist Christopher Wood who in turn showed the book he had bought to art dealer Andrew Stewart. On a follow up visit to the bookshop Stewart bought the remaining books with drawings and visited  the artists house the following day, where he discovered a vast collection of previously unseen paintings and drawings spanning a period of more than fifty years.\nWoodrow occasionally worked on unusual materials \u2013 some oil paintings were produced on improvised canvasses of hessian from coal sacks, or cardboard boxes.\nThe first exhibition of his work was held at 108 Fine Art in Harrogate in 2001, followed by public art gallery retrospectives in Leeds, Manchester and the Royal College of Art in October 2005. Other solo exhibitions have been held at The Fine Art Society London, Leeds Metropolitan University Art Gallery, Hull University Art Gallery, Liverpool University Art Gallery and at The Pannet Art Gallery, Whitby.\nHis story has attracted considerable press interest, and was covered in The Sunday Times, The Times and Spectator magazine as well as the Yorkshire Post and Whitby Gazette. In October 2009 thirty of his paintings were shown at The Fine Art Society, London.\nHis work can be found in several major private and public art collections including Leeds City Art Gallery; The Stanley and Audrey Burton Art Gallery at The University of Leeds; Manchester Art Gallery; Ben Uri Gallery, London; and The University of Hull's art gallery.\nA play based on the artist's life story was produced by Liz Postlethwaite and successfully toured the North of England in 2013.\nWoodrow died in a Manchester hospital in February 2006.\nJoash Woodrow is represented by 108 Fine Art, Harrogate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Yorkshire", "response": ["|Joash Woodrow"]}, {"page": "Leeds Arts University", "response": ["* Joash Woodrow, painter"]}, {"page": "2006 in art", "response": ["*15 February \u2013 Joash Woodrow, English artist (b.1927)"]}, {"page": "1927 in art", "response": ["* April 6 \u2013 Joash Woodrow, English artist (d.2006)"]}, {"page": "Leeds", "response": ["Leeds produced many notable artists and sculptors, including Kenneth Armitage, John Atkinson Grimshaw, Jacob Kramer, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Edward Wadsworth and Joash Woodrow, and was the centre for a particularly radical strain of British art. Before the First World War Leeds was the home of an unusual modernist arts organisation, called the Leeds Arts Club, founded by Alfred Orage, which lasted from 1903 to 1923. Notable members included Jacob Kramer, Herbert Read, Frank Rutter and Michael Sadler. As well as advocating a radical political agenda, supporting the Suffragettes, the Independent Labour Party and the Fabian Society, and promoting the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, the Leeds Arts Club was almost unique in Britain as being an exponent of German Expressionist ideas about art and culture. As a result, it staged very early British exhibitions of work by European expressionist artists, such as Wassily Kandinsky, showing their work in the city as early as 1913,Tom Steele, Alfred Orage and the Leeds Arts Club (London: Orage Press, 2009) and produced its own English Expressionist artists, including Jacob Kramer and Bruce Turner.Michael Paraskos, The Yorkshire Art Exhibition (Scarborough: Scarborough Museum and Art Gallery, 2000); see also Michael Paraskos, English Expressionism (unpublished academic dissertation, University of Leeds, 1997)"]}, {"page": "Woodrow (name)", "response": ["* Joash Woodrow (1927\u20132006), reclusive English artist"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Joash Woodrow, painter"]}, {"page": "History of the Jews in Leeds", "response": ["Joash Woodrow (1927\u20132006), who studied at Leeds College of Art and the Royal College of Art, was a reclusive artist, depicting subjects within Leeds and the Jewish community, who became highly acclaimed.
