Another influential movement was started by Franz Mesmer (1734\u20131815) and his student Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puys\u00e9gur (1751\u20131825). Called Mesmerism or animal magnetism, it would have a strong influence on the rise of dynamic psychology and psychiatry as well as theories about hypnosis.Ellenberger, H. F. (1970).

In 1853 Walter Cooper Dendy introduced the term \"psycho-therapeia\" regarding how physicians might influence the mental states of sufferers and thus their bodily ailments, for example by creating opposing emotions to promote mental balance.The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine  Mark Jackson, OUP Oxford, 25 August 2011. Pg527 Daniel Hack Tuke cited the term and wrote about \"psycho-therapeutics\" in 1872, in which he also proposed making a science of animal magnetism.Shamdasani S.

Lea. Philadelphia: 1873 Hippolyte Bernheim and colleagues in the \"Nancy School\" developed the concept of \"psychotherapy\" in the sense of using the mind to heal the body through hypnotism, yet further. Charles Lloyd Tuckey's 1889 work, Psycho-therapeutics, or Treatment by Hypnotism and Suggestion popularized the work of the Nancy School in English.Tuckey, C. Lloyd Psycho-therapeutics, or, Treatment by sleep and suggestion Balliere, Tindall, and Cox. London: 1889 Also in 1889 a clinic used the word in its title for the first time, when Frederik van Eeden and Albert Willem van Renterghem in Amsterdam renamed theirs \"Clinique de Psycho-th\u00e9rapeutique Suggestive\" after visiting Nancy. During this time, travelling stage hypnosis became popular, and such activities added to the scientific controversies around the use of hypnosis in medicine. Also in 1892, at the second congress of experimental psychology, van Eeden attempted to take the credit for the term psychotherapy and to distance the term from hypnosis. In 1896, the German journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Hypnotismus, Suggestionstherapie, Suggestionslehre und verwandte psychologische Forschungen changed its name to Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Hypnotismus, Psychotherapie sowie andere psychophysiologische und psychopathologische Forschungen, which is probably the first journal to use the term. Thus psychotherapy initially meant \"the treatment of disease by psychic or hypnotic influence, or by suggestion\"."]}, {"page": "Hanwell", "response": ["* Daniel Hack Tuke: distinguished mental doctor; related to the line of Tukes who founded the York Retreat"]}, {"page": "Henry Scott Tuke", "response": ["Tuke was born at Lawrence Street, York, into the prominent Quaker Tuke family.

First, \"an alcoholic patient becomes insane because he drinks; a dipsomaniac is insane before he commences to drink.\" Second,\"alcoholism is an intoxication which has as its cause alcohol; dipsomania has its cause in a defective mental condition, and alcohol is but a secondary factor, which may be replaced by any other poison, leaving to the syndrome all its psychological characters.\" Third, \"dipsomania proceeds in paroxysmal attacks, and the appetite for strong drink is absent during the intervals between the attacks. Alcoholism has no definite course.\"  Fourth, \"a dipsomaniac satisfies a pathological and imperious want; he does not like alcohol, and takes it against his will,\" whereas \"an alcoholic individual has no actual want; he only obeys a vice, a proclivity, and an alteration of his moral sense.\" Fifth, a dipsomaniac is conscious and ashamed of his condition, whereas an alcoholic is sometimes unaware of, but more often indifferent to it. Finally, he concluded that \"dipsomania is a syndrome, always identical with itself, whilst alcoholism is an intoxication varying much in its clinical symptoms.\""]}, {"page": "James Cowles Prichard", "response": ["* Prichard and Symonds in Special Relation to Mental Science, by Daniel Hack Tuke (1891)."]}, {"page": "James Hack Tuke", "response": ["Born at York, England in into a Quaker family, he was the son of Samuel Tuke and his wife Priscilla Hack; their seventh child, he had Daniel Hack Tuke as a brother.
