Gaining recognition from these films she was approached to write a treatment that would eventually become her  debut feature film Ratcatcher funded by BBC Scotland and Path\u00e9. Ramsay\u2019s Ratcatcher was given many awards along with Ramsay being awarded  BAFTA\u2019s Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. \nHer films are marked by a fascination with children and young people and the recurring themes of grief, guilt, death, and its aftermath. They are low on dialogue and explicit story exposition, and instead use images, vivid details, music, and sound design to create their worlds. In April 2013 she was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

She shot for it within a week; she did not receive a traditional script or dialogues and improvised most of her scenes with Bale. She said that shooting with Malick influenced her own directorial venture, A Tale of Love and Darkness, which released in the same year. Based on Israeli author Amos Oz's autobiographical novel of the same name which is set in Jerusalem during the last years of the British Mandate of Palestine, the Hebrew-language film starred Portman who also produced and co-wrote it. She wanted to adapt the book since she first read it a decade ago, but postponed it until she was old enough to play the leading role of a mother herself. She collaborated closely with Amos, showing him drafts of her script as she adapted the book. A. O. Scott of The New York Times found it to be a \"conscientious adaptation of a difficult book\" and was appreciative of Portman's potential as a filmmaker. She next produced and starred in the western film Jane Got a Gun about a young mother seeking vengeance. Initially scheduled to be directed by Lynne Ramsay, the production was plagued with numerous difficulties. Ramsay did not turn up on set for the first day of filming and was eventually replaced with Gavin O'Connor. Michael Fassbender, Jude Law and Bradley Cooper were all cast as the male lead, before Ewan McGregor played the part. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian reviewed that Portman's \"stately performance\" was not enough to save the \"laborious and solemn western\", and it grossed less than $4\u00a0million against its $25\u00a0million budget."]}, {"page": "List of adaptations of works by Stephen King", "response": ["| Lynne Ramsay"]}, {"page": "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon", "response": ["In August 2019, the project was revived, with Romero's production company still attached.

The film is about Joe (played by Phoenix), a traumatized former FBI agent and Gulf War veteran who tracks down missing girls for a living. To prepare for the film, Phoenix was advised by a former bodyguard who goes on international missions to rescue children suffering sexual exploitation and abuse by human traffickers; he gained a significant amount of weight and muscle for the part. Phoenix was Ramsay's first and only choice to play the veteran, with Ramsay calling him \"my soulmate in making movies\". The film premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where it received universal acclaim and earned Phoenix the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times described Phoenix's performance as \"the most rivetingly contained\" work of his career and Dominick Suzanne-Mayer of Consequence noted that his evocative manners in the film, led to him giving career-high work and \"the kind of haunting turn that only comes around a few times every decade or so\".", "Phoenix has three upcoming films.
