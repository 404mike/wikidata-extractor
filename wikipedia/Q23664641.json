Seven players were offered new contracts and two contracts were also offered to Middlesbrough loanees Jonathan Grounds and Jonathan Franks. Vice-captain Luke Ayling and midfielder Ed Upson agreed to new two years contracts whereas Dominic Blizzard, Richard Hinds and Gavin Williams all agreed new one-year deals.

Middlesbrough duo Grounds and Franks also both rejected Yeovil's approaches. Player-coach Nathan Jones left the club after seven years and 211 matches, three years of which were spent as assistant manager to Terry Skiverton, to take up a role at Charlton Athletic as their Under-21 Professional Development Coach."]}]}}
