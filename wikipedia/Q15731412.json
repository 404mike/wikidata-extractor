The band chose Gorwel Owen as co-producer, having previously worked with him on their first two albums, 1996's Fuzzy Logic and 1997's Radiator. The majority of Mwng was recorded  with Owen at Ofn Studios in Llanfaelog, Wales. According to Rhys, the band had to play in separate rooms to avoid the sound of one instrument bleeding onto the track of another during recording due to Ofn's small size. \"Y Gwyneb Iau\" and \"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" were recorded at Famous Studios in Cardiff, and were engineered by Greg Haver, while \"Y Teimlad\" was recorded at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, and was engineered by Michael Brennan, Jr. \"Sarn Helen\" was recorded and engineered by keyboardist Cian Ciaran in his living room. Overdubs for all songs were added at Ofn with Owen, who also mixed the album at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. Songs were recorded almost entirely live, with the band wanting to make a \"really immediate record\" as a reaction against the drawn out recording sessions for Guerilla and 1997's Radiator, which had taken several months and proved frustrating for the group. The version of \"Nythod Cacwn\" that appears on the album is the original demo, with  Rhys on drums. The band felt that, although the demo did not sound very professional, there was a warmth to it that would be impossible to recreate were the group to record the song again. The album's title translates into English as \"Mane\". According to Rhys, the band did not have the mane of a particular animal in mind, but felt it could be \"an extension of a Super Furry Animal\".", "*Greg Haver \u2013 engineering (Famous Studios)"]}, {"page": "International Velvet (album)", "response": ["* Greg Haver - engineering on \"Johnny Come Lately\""]}, {"page": "Amy Wadge", "response": ["Having moved to Wales and graduated from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Wadge started performing at open mic sessions in Cardiff's Toucan Club and soon started developing a fanbase and gaining critical recognition.
