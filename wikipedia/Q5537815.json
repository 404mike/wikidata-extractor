They finished thirteenth in 1912\u201313 and financial pressure led to the cutting of the professional staff form 24 to 18. The following season they finished bottom of the league and were relegated to division two of the Southern League. The quality of teams was much lower and Coventry had some big victories in the 1914\u201315 season but the finances of the club were once more in grave danger. The club tried unsuccessfully to join the Football League's second division and came close to extinction in the summer of 1915. They were saved in part by the decision to abandon the upcoming FA Cup and Southern League seasons because of World War I. Although no football was played for the next few years City still had liabilities and in 1917 had to be rescued by David Cooke, who paid off the debts and began replenishing the club's staff. Seeking to make the step up to the Football League after the war, the club played regular friendly matches against local clubs such as Aston Villa during 1918 and then negotiated a place for itself in the 1918\u201319 Football League Midland Section, a temporary wartime division operating while the main league was suspended. The rules allowed guest players and City made use of two internationals based in Coventry during the war \u2013 England's Jesse Pennington and Scotland's George Chaplin. The division was somewhat amateurish due to the absence of many players but Coventry acquitted themselves well, winning games against top-flight Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday, and Huddersfield Town. In early 1919 they made a speculative application for league status and were successful, topping the ballot and gaining entry to the second division when full-time football restarted in 1919\u201320.", "Recognizing the need to strengthen the playing squad and the administration of the club, the club made a number of investments in preparation for league football. Among the new signings were George Chaplin, who joined permanently had played in the wartime team, and inside-forward Alec Mercer of Bury. Highfield Road was upgraded, with a new capacity of 40,000. Despite these improvements, the club's first twelve years in the Football League were mostly disastrous, both on and off the field. Beginning with a 5\u20130 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur, City lost their first ten games in 1919\u201320 and failed to record a win until Christmas Day. William Clayton , manager since 1917, resigned a few months into the season. The club's form improved somewhat under the new boss Harry Pollitt but, with one game remaining, City still remained in danger of finishing in the bottom two and having to seek re-election. In the season's final game, City came from behind to beat Bury 2\u20131 in front of a then-record 22,000 crowd. The win ensured the club's safety and meant Lincoln City lost their league place. The match became infamous, as it transpired some years later that Coventry and Bury had colluded to rig the game. The FA set up an enquiry in 1923 which concluded \"The Commission is satisfied that an arrangement was made between Bury and Coventry allowing the latter to win\". Both clubs received a heavy fine, along with life bans from football for several officials including David Cooke and later, in 1925, Harry Pollitt."]}, {"page": "Alex Chaplin", "response": ["His brothers were fellow professional players Jack Chaplin and George Chaplin."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football families", "response": ["* Jack Chaplin, George Chaplin (brother), Alex Chaplin (brother)"]}, {"page": "Chaplin, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Chaplin"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh Exhibition Cup", "response": ["|LB ||||George Chaplin "]}]}}
