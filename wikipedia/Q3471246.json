In 1786, he published An Essay Intended to Establish a Standard for an Universal System of Stenography, or Short Hand Writing..., the first shorthand system to be used all over the English-speaking world. His stenographic method consisted in cutting out the superfluous consonants as well as the vowels in polysyllabic words. It used an alphabet composed of 19 letters of simplified shapes.\nHe taught stenography at Oxford as well as the universities of Scotland and Ireland for many years.His system was adopted for several other languages, including French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Swedish. His book was translated and published in France by Th\u00e9odore-Pierre Bertin in 1792 under the title Syst\u00e8me universel et complet de Stenographie ou Mani\u00e8re abr\u00e9g\u00e9e d'\u00e9crire applicable \u00e0 tous les idiomes.\nHe also published a book on angling in 1800, titled Angling in All Its Branches.", "link_mentions": {}}}
