He managed to fought off competition from new signing Paul Black. Bakayogo started the season well when he scored his first goal in over a year, in a 3\u20131 win over Leyton Orient in the opening game of the season. Bakayogo then scored his second goal of the season, in a 4\u20130 win over Colchester United on 1 September 2012. After the match, Manager Ronnie Moore said: \u201cZoum has the energy to get into scoring positions and to get back. His was a great finish.\u201d He then set up a goal for Jake Cassidy, who later scored twice, in a 5\u20132 win over Crawley Town on 22 September 2012. Due to Black's return from injury, Bakayogo began to \"play into a more attacking role\" for the side, which Manager Moore said: \"Once Paul has some sort of fitness we will have the option of playing him at left back so we can push Zoumana Bakayogo further forward into the wide midfield role\".<bt> His third goal for the club of the season came on 12 January 2013, in a 2\u20130 win over Crawley Town. His performance led the club to begin negotiating with Bakayogo over a new contract. In a match against Stevenage on 24 March 2013, Bakayogo scored twice for the side, in a 3\u20131 win, adding his tally to five goals this season. For his performance in the 2012\u201313 season, where he made fifty\u2013two appearances and scoring five times for the side, Bakayogo was awarded the fans\u2019 player of the season and players\u2019 player of the season awards."]}, {"page": "Llandudno Junction F.C.", "response": ["In the 2008\u201309 season, the club won the Barrit Cup, and had in their squad future Wolves striker Jake Cassidy."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 16 March 2012 || Jake Cassidy || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Tranmere Rovers || style=\"text-align:center;\"|End of season"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["Stevenage's nine game unbeaten run was ended on 6 April, losing 3\u20130 away to Tranmere Rovers courtesy of two early goals from on loan striker Jake Cassidy, and a second-half strike from Lucas Akins. Three days later, on 9 April, Stevenage welcomed Preston North End to Broadhall Way, signalling the return of former manager Graham Westley, who left Stevenage in January 2012 to take up the vacant position at Deepdale. The game ended 1\u20131, stretching Stevenage's winless run to seven league games. Preston took the lead with just four minutes remaining, with substitute Iain Hume sliding the ball in from six yards out following Danny Mayor's through ball. Stevenage then equalised in the fourth minute of injury time, with captain Mark Roberts heading in Michael Bostwick's floated cross to ensure a share of the spoils. The result meant that Stevenage were in ninth position, six points away from the final play-off place with just six games remaining. Stevenage travelled to in-form Yeovil Town five days after the draw with Preston, looking to secure a first away win in just under two months. Stevenage won the match 6\u20130, recording their biggest Football League victory to date, as well as recording the joint biggest away victory of 2011\u201312 League One campaign. Stevenage took an early lead in the match when Patrick Agyemang was played into the area by Craig Reid, Agyemang then squared the ball across goal for Luke Freeman to score from close range. Yeovil were reduced to ten men when Michael Woods fouled Michael Bostwick. Agyemang scored Stevenage's second goal when he collected Jamaal Lascelles long pass, before calmly beating Sam Walker in the Yeovil goal. Two goals within the space of three second half minutes put the game beyond doubt, with Jon Ashton and Lascelles scoring headers from set pieces. Mark Roberts added a fifth goal with ten minutes remaining \u2014 prodding in Freeman's centre. Freeman then scored his second, and Stevenage's sixth, when Jordan Slew made room down the right wing after a neat interchange with Agyemang, before finding Freeman at the back post to tap in from six yards out. The club then welcomed play-off rivals Carlisle United to Broadhall Way, knowing that a defeat would virtually end the club's play-off hopes. Stevenage dominated the first-half, but were unable to take an advantage into the interval. The second half was a much more even affair, with both teams spurning goalscoring opportunities. The deadlock was broken with just fifteen minutes remaining, substitute John Mousinho, returning from a six-month injury lay-off, latched onto Stacy Long's chipped through ball, before crashing the ball into the goal off the crossbar. Four days later, on 21 April, Stevenage hosted another team hoping to snatch the final play-off place when Brentford travelled to Broadhall Way. Stevenage secured a 2\u20131 victory, consequently ending Brentford's play-off hopes in the process. The visitors had the opportunity to take the lead on the half hour mark when Jamaal Lascelles was adjudged to have pushed Clinton Morrison in the area. However, Clayton Donaldson's penalty rebounded off the crossbar and Stevenage were able to clear to ensure the teams went in level at half-time. Brentford were then handed another chance from the penalty spot five minutes after the interval, this time the referee deemed Jon Ashton to have fouled Morrison. Brentford's Sam Saunders stepped up and his powerful penalty rebounded off the post and into the arms of Chris Day. Just three minutes after the second penalty miss, Stevenage were one goal to the good. Craig Reid controlled Lawrie Wilson's low cross, before hitting a shot on the turn that bounced off the ground and past Brentford goalkeeper Simon Moore. Luke Freeman then doubled Stevenage's advantage ten minutes later, dispossessing Adam Thompson before cutting in and hitting a right-footed shot that crashed into the goal off the post. Saunders reduced the deficit in injury-time with a curling free-kick, although Stevenage held on to secure a vital victory. The third straight victory, coupled with Notts County's home loss to Bury, meant that Stevenage were back in the play-off places with just two games remaining. Stevenage then travelled to Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United in a game that was televised live on Sky Sports on 28 April, and attracted a crowd of over 30,000 spectators. The game was an evening kick-off, meaning Stevenage had moved down to seventh in the league table as a result of Notts County's 4\u20133 win at Wycombe Wanderers earlier in the day. The game ended 2\u20132, with Stevenage taking a two-goal lead through strikes from Joel Byrom and Scott Laird, before Sheffield United's Richard Cresswell and Matthew Lowton restored parity. The draw meant that Stevenage had regained their place in sixth with just one game remaining."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Premier Reserve League", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Jake Cassidy"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| Jake Cassidy||||Wolverhampton Wanderers||16 March||end of the season", "| 18 |||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jake Cassidy"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Football League One", "response": ["|Jake Cassidy"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["Colchester slumped to their first league defeat of the season on 1 September after they were beaten 4\u20130 at Tranmere Rovers following a Jake Cassidy hat-trick.

The visitors opened the scoring after just two minutes; Felipe Morais turning in Greg Tansey's cross at the back post. Yeovil responded instantly through Paddy Madden's scissor kick. Shortly after the interval, Lucas Akins was on hand to turn in substitute Marcus Haber's low cross, before James Dunne's deflected effort doubled Stevenage's advantage and put the game beyond doubt. Four days later, Stevenage suffered their second consecutive heavy home defeat, this time losing 4\u20131 to Preston North End. The away side scored early on through Stuart Beavon's powerful strike, before Stevenage's Greg Tansey briefly restored parity with a curling effort from the edge of the area. Preston regained the lead through Jack King following good work from Jeffrey Monakana ten minutes before half-time. Two second-half long-range strikes from Monakana and Nicky Wroe respectively gave Preston a comfortable win. Another defeat followed a week later, losing 4\u20131 away to Sheffield United. The home side took the lead on the twenty-minute mark, defender Neill Collins heading home unmarked from Ryan Flynn's centre. Stevenage equalised just before half-time, captain Mark Roberts scoring with a header from Filipe Morais' corner. The parity was short-lived, however, as Shaun Miller netted twice after the interval, before Chris Porter added a fourth late-on to ensure a routine victory. Stevenage then travelled to Bournemouth three days later, securing a 1\u20131 draw. The visitors took the lead mid-way through the first-half when Marcus Haber found space down the right wing, before laying the ball onto Greg Tansey, who found the net from just outside the area. Bournemouth equalised with fifteen minutes remaining, substitute Matt Tubbs heading in Lewis Grabban's cross at the back post. Another 1\u20131 scoreline followed when Stevenage took on league leaders Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way on 24 November. The game came to life with just ten minutes left; Tranmere striker Jake Cassidy found space in the area, and headed in Adam McGurk's cross unmarked. Stevenage then hit the post late-on through Robin Shroot, before equalising deep into stoppage time when Greg Tansey picked up Mark Roberts' pass and curled a looping shot over Owain F\u00f4n Williams in the Tranmere goal. The goal was Tansey's third in four games."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| Jake Cassidy||||Wolverhampton Wanderers||2 August||1 January", "| 9 |||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jake Cassidy"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 24 January 2014 || Jake Cassidy || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Tranmere Rovers || style=\"text-align:center;\"|27 April 2014"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| Jake Cassidy||||Wolverhampton Wanderers||20 January||28 April", "| 14 |||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jake Cassidy"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|25 July 2014|| Jake Cassidy|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Notts County|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 January 2015", "|15 January 2015|| Jake Cassidy|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Southend United|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|End of season"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Southend United F.C. season", "response": ["|15 January 2015||FW||Jake Cassidy||Wolverhampton Wanderers||30 June 2015||"]}]}}
