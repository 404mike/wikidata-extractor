After a short stay at home he again joined his regiment at the Pyrenees, and did his greatest military service at the Nivelle, where, with instinctive military insight, he secured the most strongly fortified part of Soult's position, practically without orders.  He served with his regiment at the battles of the Nive, where he received two wounds, Orthes, and Toulouse.  For his services he was made brevet Lieutenant-Colonel, and one of the first Companions of the Bath.  Like his brother Charles he then entered the military college at Farnham.  He commanded his regiment in the invasion of France after Waterloo, and remained in France with the army of occupation until 1819, when he retired on half-pay.
