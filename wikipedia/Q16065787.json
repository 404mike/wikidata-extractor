The products of the whaling trade such as oil and whalebone (baleen) were essential to the British economy during this period of the Industrial Revolution and the rigours of life on board a whaleship in the Greenland fisheries produced a particularly hardy and efficient breed of sailor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of sea captains", "response": ["|John Parker (whaling master)"]}, {"page": "John Parker", "response": ["John Parker may refer to: ", "*John Parker (Canadian politician) (born 1954), former Ontario MPP and Toronto City Councillor", "*John Parker (died 1617) (1548\u20131617), MP for Truro, Hastings, Launceston and East Looe", "*John Parker (died 1619) (1548\u20131619), MP for Queenborough", "*John Parker (MP for Rochester) (fl. 1631\u20131680), recorder in Kent, MP for Rochester, a judge and a Baron of the Exchequer", "*John Parker (MP for Clitheroe) (1754\u20131797), MP for Clitheroe", "*John Parker (cleric) (1798\u20131860), cleric and artist.

The vessel was captured by the British during the American War of Independence, when she operated as an American privateer, and was bought by a shipowner for use as a cargo ship in the wine trade to Oporto. After a refit in 1784, which involved strengthening the vessel's hull, she began work as a whaler in the Arctic, based at Hull, although she was occasionally used for other cargo. In 1849, the ship carried relief supplies in support of Franklin's lost expedition, during which time she was threatened with sinking several times due to pack ice, including one instance when she was trapped for six weeks in Melville Bay. Notable whaling captains of the Truelove included John Parker, William Barron, and William Wells (1854-1860 & 1866-67) The vessel retired from whaling in 1868, having completed 72 voyages. After this time, she was still capable of being used as a general cargo ship. She was eventually broken up, probably around 1888, after 124\u00a0years of near continuous service. Robert E.
