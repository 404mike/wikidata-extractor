He was a world indoor record holder and a gold medallist at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in 1970.\nHe won the 4-mile Nos Galan in 1967, was the North of England champion over 3 miles in 1968, then became British Universities champion in the 5000 metres in 1969. He began to establish himself nationally shortly after. He was runner-up to Ian McCafferty over 3000 metres at the AAA Indoor Championships in 1968 and 1969 before finally succeeding his rival in 1970. He also took third in the 5000 m behind Ian Stewart and Alan Blinston at the 1969 AAA Championships.Wilde's greatest achievement was a world indoor best of 7:46.85 to win the 3000m gold medal at the 1970 European Athletics Indoor Championships. This stood as the championship record until 1973, when it was bettered by Emiel Puttemans of Belgium. That same year he placed sixth at the 1970 International Cross Country Championships and shared in the team title alongside individual medallists Mike Tagg and Trevor Wright. He made one more major international appearance, coming 61st at the 1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships.\nHe entered the 1972 Maxol Marathon in Manchester but his finish in 2:23:04 hours was only worth 36th place. He had better long-distance performances in his later career, taking the 10-mile Snowdon Race in 1977 and 1978 before being beaten into second place by Jeff Norman in 1979. His best marathon outing was at the 1979 Grandma's Marathon, which he won in a time of 2:14:44 hours. He was an accomplished fell runner, setting a long-lasting course record for the Lantern Pike fell race in addition to wins at the Fairfield horseshoe and Darwen moors races. Other notable performances were a win at the 1978 Paavo Nurmi Marathon and runner-up finishes at the Juan Muguerza Memorial and Campaccio cross country races.He was a member of Manchester Harriers and Athletics Club during his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ricky Wilde", "response": ["Ricky Wilde (born Richard James Reginald Steven Smith, 6 November 1961, sometimes credited as Ricki Wilde) is a British songwriter, musician, and record producer. He is the younger brother of singer Kim Wilde (the two are \"Irish twins\", having been born slightly less than one year apart); their father is singer-actor Marty Wilde.", "At the age of eleven, Wilde was signed by record producer Jonathan King to King's UK Records label, and released his first single in November 1972, called \"I Am an Astronaut\". King became his mentor and had great faith in Wilde and groomed him for stardom as the teenybopper star of 1973. The children's magazine Look-in featured Wilde and Donny Osmond on the cover in June 1973 with the headline \"Is Ricky Wilde the new Donny?\". Subsequent singles were \"Do It Again, a Little Bit Slower\", \"I Wanna Go to a Disco\" and \"Teen Wave\".\u00a0 However, the singles were not successful in the UK, although he was featured in youth magazines at the time and appeared with his father alongside eleven years old pop rival Darren Burn in BBC Television's Man Alive documentary film Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, made in July 1973.\u00a0 He had some hits in Scandinavia and Spain at the time.", "Recordings of new material in 1980 led to the 'discovery' of his sister Kim. Wilde's new role was that of producer and co-writer, a role he has fulfilled up until now. By his own admission, he was happy to be more in the background as of that moment.\u00a0 After Kim Wilde paused her career in pop music, Ricky Wilde continued to work in the music industry. In 2005 he was one of the initiators of the band, Sonic Hub, and of the record label Sonic Hub Records."]}, {"page": "Snowdon Race", "response": ["| Ricky Wilde", "| Ricky Wilde", "| Ricky Wilde"]}, {"page": "1970 International Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|   6 || Ricky Wilde ||  || 37:07", "|align=center|  1 || align=left |  || align=left | Mike TaggTrevor WrightDick TaylorRicky WildeMike TurnerMike Baxter || 35"]}, {"page": "1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Senior men's race", "response": ["|align=center|  61 || align=left | Ricky Wilde || align=left |  || ", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Ricky Wilde || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 61"]}, {"page": "Richard Wilde (athlete)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ricky Wilde (athlete)"]}, {"page": "1970 European Athletics Indoor Championships \u2013 Men's 3000 metres", "response": ["|Ricky Wilde", "| 1 || 1 || align=\"left\" | Ricky Wilde ||align=left|  || 8:01.4 || Q", "|  || align=\"left\" | Ricky Wilde ||align=left|  || 7:46.85 || WB"]}, {"page": "Richard Wilde (runner)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ricky Wilde (athlete)"]}]}}
