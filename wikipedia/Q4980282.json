In 1956 he joined English First Division club Birmingham City, for whom he went on to play in the finals of the 1960 and 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, becoming one of the first Welsh footballers to take part in European competition.In 1962 he moved to Middlesbrough, and became the first substitute ever used by the club.He emigrated to South Africa, playing for and later managing Southern Suburbs F.C.,Orritt died in a Johannesburg nursing home on 24 March 2014 at the age of 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen", "response": ["* Bryan Orritt \u2013 footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Middlesbrough F.C. players", "response": ["|Inside-forward||1962\u20131966||\u2013||||||style=\"background:#98FB98\"|Bryan Orritt was the first substitute ever used by Middlesbrough."]}, {"page": "Bryan Orrit", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bryan Orritt"]}, {"page": "David Jones (footballer, born 1940)", "response": ["Jones was born in Kingsley, Cheshire.

Anderlecht manager Bill Gormlie described Union Saint-Gilloise as \"fit, fast and powerful\", and thought Birmingham \"will do well to go home with only a one-goal deficit.\" In the event, they did rather better than that. Hooper, Bryan Orritt, Taylor and Jim Barrett, who had signed only days before the game, gave them a 4\u20132 victory. The match was the last of goalkeeper Gil Merrick's club-record 551 competitive appearances in Birmingham's first team. At St Andrew's, in fog so thick that there was a distinct possibility of the match being abandoned, Birmingham repeated the 4\u20132 scoreline. They became the first British club side to reach a European final, despite playing with ten men from the 18th minute, after Taylor suffered a badly broken leg that was to keep him out of football for a year, and finishing the match with only nine when Barrett was also injured.", "|IL||10|| Bryan Orritt"]}, {"page": "1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["In the first leg of the final, played in front of a crowd of only 21,000 at St Andrew's, Pedro Manfredini scored twice for Roma, and goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini made several high-class saves, before Mike Hellawell and Bryan Orritt scored late in the game to equalise the scores. In the second leg, watched by 60,000 spectators, Roma won by two goals to nil\u00a0\u2013 an own goal when an attempted clearance rebounded off Brian Farmer's shin, and a shot from distance by Paolo Pestrin very late in the game while Birmingham's players were all upfield attacking\u00a0\u2013 in the Stadio Olimpico to win their first and, , only trophy in European competition.", "The game was even for the first half-hour, then Manfredini scored a shot on the turn to give Roma the lead. They doubled their lead a quarter of an hour into the second half, \"thanks once more to the brilliant opportunism of Manfredini\", whom the Birmingham Mail described as \"a splendid centre-forward who acted as a one-man attack for most of the match\". Despite most of the attacking play coming from the home side, they found Cudicini in excellent form, and it was not until the last ten minutes of the match that Mike Hellawell's snap-shot surprised the goalkeeper to make it 2-1. With just two minutes left of normal time, Harris hit the bar, and in a goalmouth scramble, the ball was forced home by Bryan Orritt\u00a0\u2013 who had fallen out of favour and been on the transfer list for several months\u00a0\u2013 to give Birmingham a late equaliser.", "|IL||10|| Bryan Orritt", "In the first few minutes of the match, Roma failed to convert three clear chances. After ten minutes, manager Carniglia ran  onto the pitch to confront Birmingham captain Bloomfield, who was bending over an injured Roma player. Following an incident between Bryan Orritt and Giampaolo Menichelli, blows were exchanged among the players, and Carniglia had to be restrained by Roma officials from joining in. This time, Birmingham manager Gil Merrick followed Carniglia onto the pitch, feeling he \"had to be there to try and cool things down\". Play continued, albeit still marred by a lack of discipline. As in the first leg, Birmingham's physical approach provoked reactions from the Roma players. Menichelli was carried off injured after an incident with Brian Farmer, Lojacono raised his hands to the referee, who took no action, and the game reached the interval still goalless, which La Stampa thought a fair reflection of the half.", "|IL||10|| Bryan Orritt"]}, {"page": "National Football League (South Africa)", "response": ["| 1967||Bob Davies (Rangers)||Charlie Naude (Germiston Callies)|| Bryan Orritt (Southern Suburbs)||Jim Scott (Durban City) 27"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["The final of the 1960\u201361 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup took place in late September and mid-October 1961, when the first round of the 1961\u201362 competition was already under way. In the semi-final, Birmingham had beaten Inter Milan home and away; no other English club beat them in a competitive match in the San Siro until Arsenal did so in the Champions League more than 40 years later. Birmingham played in the final for the second consecutive season, having lost to Barcelona in 1960. In the first leg, missed chances and poor defending allowed Roma to take a two-goal lead at St Andrew's, but second-half goals from Mike Hellawell and Bryan Orritt, whose late equaliser came after Jimmy Harris's shot rebounded from the crossbar, took Birmingham into the second leg on level terms.
