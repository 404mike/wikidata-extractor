Burch was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace and who could also play as a wicket-keeper. He was born at Braunstone, Leicestershire.\nBurch made his first-class debut for Leicestershire against Hampshire in the 1958 County Championship, making six further appearances in that season. The following season he established himself in the Leicestershire team, making 24 first-class appearances in 1959, scoring 724 runs at an average of 20.11. He also made three half centuries with a high score of 64 not out, which he made against Nottinghamshire. Burch didn't play for Leicestershire again until 1963, making three appearances in that season, before making twelve first-class appearances in 1964, the last of which came against Essex in the 1964 County Championship. Burch scored 254 runs in his final season with Leicestershire, at an average of 15.00 and with a single half century score of 59 against Hampshire. Burch played a total of 46 first-class matches for Leicestershire, scoring 1,067 runs at an average of 15.46, with a high score of 64 not out. In the field he took 55 catches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HVV Den Haag", "response": ["* Geoffrey Burch (1971\u20131981)"]}, {"page": "Ray Julian", "response": ["From 1959 to 1965, Julian was Leicestershire's main wicketkeeper, though his indifferent batting and Leicestershire's perennially long tail in this period meant that other wicketkeepers such as John Mitten and Geoffrey Burch were tried, though not usually for long. His best season as a wicketkeeper was 1961, when he received his county cap and took 72 catches with 7 stumpings. As a batsman, he scored 561 runs in 1960 with an average of 12.46 and a highest score of just 44: the high aggregate reflects the fact that he went in at No 8 because in Terry Spencer, John Savage and Brian Boshier or Peter Broughton, there were usually three even worse batsmen than he was, and Leicestershire usually batted twice in each match. His highest score, one of only two innings over 50, was 51, made against Worcestershire in 1962 as a high-scoring match petered out to a draw."]}]}}
