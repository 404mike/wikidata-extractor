He is thought to have grown up in the Llanybydder area, Carmarthenshire. He is known to have been studying at the Academy in Swansea in 1786. By 1787 however, he was ordained and pastor of the church at Pen-y-Graig and of Capel Sul, Kidwelly. He subsequently (about 1790) moved to Holywell, where he stayed until 1800. It was there he published his radical magazine 'Y Geirgrawn' (nine numbers, Feb \u2014 Oct 1796). Its controversial views are known to have caused upset amongst the authorities and his congregation, to the extent that surviving letters on the subject speak of \u2018unhappy misunderstandings\u2019 which \u2018went on for years\u2019. On leaving Holywell in 1802 he moved to Welshpool, and then, in 1803 to Stoneway, Bridgnorth.\nHe died in 1807, and was buried in Bridgnorth chapel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Davies", "response": ["David Davies may refer to:", "*David Davies (industrialist) (1818\u20131890), also known as David Davies Llandinam, MP for Cardigan, 1874\u20131885, and Cardiganshire, 1885\u20131886", "*David Davies (Australian politician) (c. 1840\u20131894), politician in colonial Victoria, Australia", "*David Davies (textile merchant) (1852\u20131934), Liberal politician, MP for Denbigh 1918\u20131922", "*Sir David Davies (dairyman) (1870\u20131958), Conservative politician", "*David Davies (Welsh politician) (born 1970), Welsh Conservative politician, and British Member of Parliament elected in 2005", "*David Davies (English actor), English actor", "*David Davies (Welsh actor) (1906\u20131974), Welsh actor", "*David Davies (artist) (1864\u20131939), Australian artist", "*David Davies (author) (1741\u20131819), Welsh author", "*David Davies (composer) (1810\u20131875), Welsh composer of \"Glan'rafon\"", "*David Davies (harpist) (1817\u20131855), Welsh harpist", "*David Davies (musician) (born 1954), British flautist, conductor and composer", "*David Davies (football administrator) (born 1948), former Executive Director of the (English) Football Association", "*David Davies (footballer, born 1879) (1879\u20131956), Brecon F.C., Hereford Town F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*David Davies (footballer, born 1888) (1888\u2013?), Oldham Athletic F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*David Davies (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1900s, and 1910s for Wales, Merthyr Tydfil, Swinton, and Oldham", "*David Davies (rugby league, born 1902) (1902\u20131992), rugby league footballer of the 1920s, and 1930s for Wales, and Broughton, Warrington, Huddersfield and Keighley", "*David Davies (rugby league, born c. 1915), rugby league footballer of the 1930s, and 1940s for Wales, and Salford", "*David Davies (swimmer) (born 1985), British long-distance swimmer", "*David Davies (electrical engineer) (born 1935), professor of electrical engineering at UCL; MoD Chief Scientific Adviser, 1993\u20131999", "*David Davies (Archdeacon of Llandaff) (1858\u20131930), Welsh clergyman", "*David Davies (Baptist minister) (1800\u20131856)", "*David Davies (Dean of Wellington) (1912\u20131987), Welsh clergyman in New Zealand", "*David Davies (Independent minister and magazine editor) (died 1807), Welsh editor of \"Y Geirgrawn\"", "*David Davies (Welsh priest) (1742\u20131819), Welsh clergyman in the Church of England", "*David Davies, 1st Baron Davies (1880\u22121944), Liberal MP for Montgomershire 1906\u20131929, grandson of the industrialist David Davies (see above)", "*David Davies, 2nd Baron Davies (1915\u22121944), major in the Royal Welch Fusiliers", "*David Davies, 3rd Baron Davies (born 1940), British peer and engineer", "*David Davies (Dai'r Cantwr) (1812\u20131874), Welsh activist sentenced for his part in the Rebecca Riots", "*David Davies (physician) (1792\u20131865), Welsh physician"]}]}}
