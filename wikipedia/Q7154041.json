However, Tonkinson was dropped from the programme at the end of March 2001 and Air left not long after. Richard Bacon and Amanda Byram remained as main presenters, the programme having reverted to two main presenters once more. The living room, which had been repainted a dark red as part of the revamp, was changed to a bright yellow and pink design, while the main presenter chairs were also reinstalled in front of the living room's French windows. They replaced the bright green sofa which had also been brought in as part of the revamp. The new logo was replaced with one more closely resembling the traditional Big Breakfast logo, albeit utilising a slightly different font.
