He was a native of Bradford, Yorkshire and gave his first broadcast there as a child pianist in 1925. Loxam made his first appearance on the keyboard of the Wurlitzer theatre organ at the then New Victoria cinema in Bradford. Arnold Loxam first visited the New Victoria Cinema, Bradford, which later became the Odeon, when he was a 14-year-old member of the audience on the opening night of the theatre on 22 September 1930.\nIn 1946 he began playing regularly for New Victoria audiences and broadcasting from the theatre for BBC Radio. He was appointed deputy organist playing every Sunday and deputised for Norman Briggs until 1948. From December 1948 Arnold also played full weeks or odd days as well as Sundays. He was famous for his bouncey style. He gave his first solo broadcast on the BBC Theatre Organ on 29 November 1947. The association with Bradford continued until 1962 when the BBC switched its broadcasts to the Leeds Odeon. Dr Loxam was invited back in 1968 to make a final broadcast from what had by then become the Gaumont before the Wurlitzer organ was taken to the North East Theatre Organ's headquarters in Howden-le-Wear, County Durham.\nLoxam met his future wife in 1948 when she was working at the New Victoria as an usherette. Mrs Audrey Loxam was his driver for 25 years, chauffeuring him around to fulfil a busy schedule of engagements in this country and overseas. He has appeared in concert almost everywhere that it is possible to play in England, and has also played concerts in the Netherlands, Canada and the United States.  North American audiences remember the Union Jack socks that he proudly wore at his concerts. In 1996 Arnold Loxam was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bradford for his musical achievements. Arnold Loxam died, aged 93, on 14 March 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plaza Cinema, Skipton", "response": ["The auditorium now has 320 seats split between stalls and circle, down from 630 when the spacing was less comfortable. A Conn 651 Organ is installed which has been played by well known organists including Miss Frieda Hall and Arnold Loxam. The red seats have recently (2018) undergone refurbishment with new arm rests."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2010", "response": ["*Arnold Loxam, 93, British organist."]}, {"page": "Burton upon Trent Town Hall", "response": ["The hall boasts a Wurlitzer organ, which had originally been installed at the Cameo Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio in 1925; after a fire in the theatre it was repossessed by its manufacturer before being installed at the Forum Cinema in Northenden, Manchester, in 1934 and then being moved to Burton Town Hall in 1973. In 1995 OS Digital Recordings released a recording from Burton upon Trent Town Hall entitled Come Dancing which involved excerpts of music performed by Arnold Loxam on the organ. An earlier Kirkland organ was added to the St Paul's Institute in 1880 and expanded by Norman and Beard in 1906."]}]}}
