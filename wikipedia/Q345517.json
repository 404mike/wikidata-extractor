At one point Humphrey memorably complained that he \"felt like an independent merchant competing against a chain store\".Solberg, p. 205.

Jack Kennedy brought family and Hollywood to Wisconsin. The people loved it and the press ate it up.\"Humphrey, p. 207 Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, but by a smaller margin than anticipated. Some commentators argued that Kennedy's victory margin had come almost entirely from areas with large Roman Catholic populations,Solberg, p. 208 and that Protestants had supported Humphrey. As a result, Humphrey refused to quit the race and decided to run against Kennedy again in the West Virginia primary. According to one biographer \"Humphrey thought his chances were good in West Virginia, one of the few states that had backed him in his losing race for vice-president four years earlier ... West Virginia was more rural than urban, [which] seemed to invite Humphrey's folksy stump style. The state, moreover, was a citadel of labor. It was depressed; unemployment had hit hard; and coal miners' families were hungry.
