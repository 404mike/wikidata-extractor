It was Gertrude who inspired his great nonsense mock-epic The Hunting of the Snark (1876), and the book is dedicated to her, and opens with a poem that uses her name as a double acrostic.Carroll first became friends with Gertrude in 1875, when she was aged nine and he was forty-three, while on holiday at the English seaside resort of Sandown.  He made a number of pen and ink sketches of Gertrude as a young girl.  He continued to correspond with her, and to spend numerous seaside holidays with her, including several when she was in her late twenties.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Hunting of the Snark", "response": ["The narrative follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark, a creature which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum. The only crewmember to find the Snark quietly vanishes, leading the narrator to explain that the Snark was a Boojum after all. The poem is dedicated to young Gertrude Chataway, whom Carroll met at the English seaside town Sandown in the Isle of Wight in 1875. Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll's religious tract, An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves \"Alice\".", "The Hunting of the Snark shares its fictional setting with Lewis Carroll\u2019s earlier poem \"Jabberwocky\" published in his 1871 children's novel Through the Looking-Glass. Eight nonsense words from \"Jabberwocky\" appear in The Hunting of the Snark: bandersnatch, beamish, frumious, galumphing, jubjub, mimsiest (which previously appeared as mimsy in \"Jabberwocky\"), outgrabe, and uffish. In a letter to the mother of his young friend Gertrude Chataway, Carroll described the domain of the Snark as \"an island frequented by the jubjub and the bandersnatch \u2014 no doubt the very island where the jabberwock was slain.\"", "Upon the printing of the book on 29 March 1876, Carroll gave away eighty signed copies to his favourite young friends; in a typical fashion, he signed them with short poems, many of them acrostics of the child's name. He dedicated The Hunting of the Snark to Gertrude Chataway, whom he had befriended in summer 1875 at the English seaside town Sandown on the Isle of Wight. He finished the dedication a month after befriending her, a double acrostic poem that not only spelled out her name, but contained a syllable of her name in the first line of each stanza. The stanza of his first draft concluded \"Rest on a friendly knee, the tale to ask / That he delights to tell.\" The poem was printed in The Hunting of the Snark with permission from Chataway's mother."]}, {"page": "Sandown", "response": ["* The author Lewis Carroll, the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, spent successive summers on Sandown sea front in the 1870s, staying first at the King's Head Hotel and later at Culverton House. In 1875, while he was writing The Hunting of the Snark, he met 9-year old Gertrude Chataway whose family was staying next door.

Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife Lorina and their children, particularly the three sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. He was widely assumed for many years to have derived his own \"Alice\" from Alice Liddell; the acrostic poem at the end of Through the Looking-Glass spells out her name in full, and there are also many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his \"little heroine\" was based on any real child,Cohen, Morton N. (ed) (1979) The Letters of Lewis Carroll, London: Macmillan.Leach, Ch. 5 \"The Unreal Alice\" and he frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. Gertrude Chataway's name appears in this form at the beginning of The Hunting of the Snark, and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her."]}]}}
