Togwell made his League debut for Barnsley on 5 August 2006, in a 2\u20131 defeat at Cardiff City. He made 46 appearances in 2006\u201307, including both Championship clashes with former club Palace, both of which finished 2\u20130 for the home team. Battling with Bobby Hassell and new signing Anderson Silva de Fran\u00e7a for a first team place, he found life tough at Oakwell the next season. In all he played 27 games, three of which came in the club's impressive FA Cup run, including a substitute appearance in the memorable victory over Premier League team Chelsea."]}, {"page": "Martin Cranie", "response": ["Seven days later, Cranie made his debut appearance with the Tykes as a substitute for Bobby Hassell in the 3\u20131 defeat at Wolves.

After some impressive performances, Atkinson was recalled to Barnsley following injuries to first team players Bobby Hassell, Paul Reid and Antony Kay. Atkinson played his first full game for the Oakwell based club on Boxing Day 2006, in a 1\u20130 win over Burnley.

During his three-year stay as Mansfield manager, he brought up several talented youngsters from the youth team, including Liam Lawrence, Bobby Hassell and Lee Williamson, and signed key players such as Chris Greenacre and Wayne Corden, guiding the \"Stags\" to the verge of promotion. However, he left the club midway through the 2001\u201302 promotion season to take control of local rivals Notts County. Stuart Watkiss took over from Dearden, and took Mansfield out of the Third Division at the end of the season."]}]}}
