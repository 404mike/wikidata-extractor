He was also one of the original presenters of News at Ten when it began in 1967.\nHe was born in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire and educated at the independent Dauntsey's School in Wiltshire. He was 6 ft 5 ins. His broadcasting career began with a spell as a radio journalist in South Africa and he was a reporter in Africa until his return to the UK in 1961.\nHe was notable for presenting the first transatlantic programme using the Telstar satellite and for commentating on state occasions such as royal weddings for ITV. After leaving ITN he became a regional news presenter on Thames Television, presenting Thames at 6 and later Thames News.\nHe is also notable for being the newscaster whose report was interrupted on 26 November 1977 by what is called now the Southern Television broadcast interruption. The mystery has never been solved.At ten minutes past five, the TV picture wobbled slightly and the sound of Andrew Gardner's professional delivery was silenced, to be replaced by a distorted voice delivering a quite remarkable message for almost six minutes. It purported to be a communication from an individual identifying themselves as Vrillon, representing a body called the Ashtar Galactic Command. And the message was simple: we humans had to give up our warlike ways and embrace a more peaceful existence... before it was too late.He remained with Thames until it lost its franchise in 1992, when he subsequently took early retirement. While retired he did some reports on such subjects as beer tasting and the wine regions of southwest Germany for a magazine for blind people.\nHe died from a heart attack on 2 April 1999, aged 66, while on a flight to Madeira. At the time of his death, he lived in Benenden, Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "ITN", "response": ["In 1967, ITN was given the go-ahead by the ITA to provide a full 30-minute daily news programme at 10 pm on ITV. There was further tension with the ITV executives as they were sceptical of the idea that viewers would want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday and they were also losing valuable peak time slots which could be used for the sale of commercial advertising. News at Ten began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 with a newscaster team consisting of Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, George Ffitch and Reginald Bosanquet. It was initially given a 13-week trial run, however, the programme proved to be extremely popular with viewers and continued for a further 32 years. News at Ten was to become one of the most prestigious news programmes of its time in British history with a reputation for high-quality journalism and innovation. ITN's News at Ten also prompted the BBC to gradually expand its 20:50 news bulletin from ten minutes to fifteen, twenty and then twenty-five minutes. The Nine O'Clock News began broadcasting in 1970 as News at Ten's rival. ITN also established other programmes in the ITV schedule. First Report, a lunchtime bulletin began in 1972 and by 1976, News at 5.45 commenced. This was a period when ITN enjoyed its greatest plaudits, following Lord Annan's 1977 report on the future of broadcasting, which declared: \"We subscribe to the generally held view that ITN has the edge over BBC news.\"", "ITN has been spoofed several times on ITV's The Benny Hill Show, namely in one 1971 show with the logo reading \"NIT\" instead of \"ITN\" and with Hill as Reginald \"Boozenquet\" and Andrew Gardner."]}, {"page": "Dauntsey's School", "response": ["*Andrew Gardner, television newscaster and presenter"]}, {"page": "ITV News", "response": ["In 1967, ITN editor Geoffrey Cox suggested launching a half-hour news bulletin for ITV, every weeknight. ITV executives, however, were sceptical of that idea, because it was thought that viewers would not want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday (there had only been one half-hour news programme in Britain previously \u2013 BBC2's Newsroom, launched in 1964). However, the idea was approved on the condition it ran for a 13-week trial, and News at Ten was born on 3 July 1967. ITN's head newscasters \u2013 Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, and George Ffitch \u2013 presented the first News at Ten, and the bulletin became so popular with viewers that it was kept in the schedules after its initial 13 weeks. The programme's titles used an excerpt of The Awakening, a piece of dramatic music composed by Johnny Pearson. The famous chimes of the Westminster Clock Tower \u2013 affectionately known as the bongs \u2013 separated each headline as it was read out. The early opening title sequences were simplistic; for the first two years, the ITN symbol faded into a wide studio shot showing the two newscasters at the desk, with the caption News at 10. Then, in 1969, a new title sequence was introduced: a slow pan of the Houses of Parliament was followed by a sharp zoom into the face of \"Big Ben\" showing the time of 22:00. The text \"Independent Television News\" was shown at the start of the sequence, followed by the individual words \"NEWS\", \"at\" and \"TEN\", which appeared in time to the title music. The sequence was amended a year later to feature the new ITN logo at the beginning. The logo, introduced in 1970, was a simple sans-serif outline of the phrase \"ITN\". The basic concept of the logo remains today."]}, {"page": "Alastair Burnet", "response": ["Burnet left ITN in 1965 to rejoin The Economist as editor, but continued broadcasting as a reporter and interviewer for Associated-Rediffusion's weekly current affairs programme This Week.Burnet, Alastair, BFI entry] He returned part-time to ITN in 1967 to launch News at Ten, presenting the first programme (during the show's thirteen-week pilot phase) on 3 July alongside Andrew Gardner, and also presented the short-lived topical interview series Man in the News in 1970. He switched to the BBC in 1972 to report and present for Panorama and Midweek and to anchor coverage of the February and October 1974 general election programmes, also covering the wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips. He continued to edit The Economist until 1974, where he raised the circulation by 60%.

It simultaneously helped popularise newscasters such as Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, Sandy Gall, Anna Ford, John Suchet, Mark Austin, Alastair Stewart and Trevor McDonald into well-known television personalities.", "The arrival of the new 30-minute programme allowed ITN to give a more in-depth and detailed treatment of serious news for the first time on British television, as well as coverage of populist stories and issues that would attract the viewing audience. The programme built on these concepts by introducing reporter packages, not the norm then but now a staple of television news, and a team of two newscasters taking turns to read stories instead of a sole presenter: a two-man team would inject personality into television news, as well as allow breaking news to be handed to the newscaster not in vision. The original newscasting team included Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, George Ffitch and Leonard Parkin. News at Ten also employed several other distinctive features which proved popular with viewers: the use of Big Ben's chimes (or \"bongs\") to separate the news headlines being read in the opening sequence, and the \"\u2026 And Finally\" report \u2013 a quirky and often humorous end piece designed to send the viewing audience to bed \"on a high note\" after 30 minutes of hard news coverage.", "In the absence of Alastair Burnet (who left ITN in 1972 to pursue a career in print journalism), News at Ten paired Andrew Gardner and Reginald Bosanquet to create one of the programme's most well liked newscasting duos. In 1978, Anna Ford became the bulletin's first female newscaster, and Alastair Burnet rejoined the programme in the same year. For more than a decade onwards, Burnet was the newscaster most associated with News at Ten, his \"serious persona\", \"sepulchral tones\" and \"deferential interviewing style\" becoming respected hallmarks of the programme. By the late 1980s, Burnet \u2013 now a member of the ITN board of directors and News at Ten's associate editor \u2013 began to draw criticism that he was losing the personal touch with his audience, allowing News at Ten to settle into a \"stodgy\" and \"old-fashioned\" complacency.
