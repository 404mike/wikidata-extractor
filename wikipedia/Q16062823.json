Tobercorran was the family house in Carnmoney, and was located on Glebe Road West, just north of Belfast where Bland and her father moved in with her aunt Sarah. Sarah had married General William James Smythe on 15 December 1857; the couple had not had children at the time of Smythe's death on 12 July 1887. The two siblings decided to set up house together, which was how Bland and her father came to live at Tobercorran.", "Bland's uncle Robert sent her a postcard of the Bl\u00e9riot monoplane from Paris, inspiring her to take up flying. She studied the measurements of the monoplane during the first official aviation meeting held in Blackpool in 1909, and added her own thoughts into the design of her plane, the Mayfly. The Mayfly had similar wings to Bl\u00e9riot's design, but it could get off the ground by itself. At that point, no one in Ireland had yet made a powered flight \u2013 the first would be Harry Ferguson, in December \u2013 and to make an aircraft would involve building it herself. Her late uncle, General William James Smythe, an astronomer and member of the Royal Society, provided a house with a workshop. After some background reading on the Wright brothers, and becoming inspired by their achievements, Bland successfully built a flyable model biplane with a wing span of six feet."]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (Q\u2013Z)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Smythe\"|William James Smythe (1816\u20131887), military officer"]}, {"page": "General Smyth", "response": ["*William James Smythe (1816\u20131887) Royal Artillery general and colonel-commandant"]}]}}
