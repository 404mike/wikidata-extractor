While discussing the controversy over Tony McNulty (who had recently admitted claiming expenses on a second home, occupied by his parents, only 8 miles away from his primary residence), Pickles admitted he claimed a second home allowance because he lived 37 miles from Westminster and needed to leave his constituency house in Brentwood at 5.30\u00a0am to get to Westminster for 9.30\u00a0am, given that he tended to get home at midnight or 1\u00a0am, although the standard time for commuters from this region is usually ninety minutes. He went on to say that it was \"no fun\" commuting into London from where he lived. In response to Pickles's comments that he \"had to be there [the House of Commons] on time\", Question Time host David Dimbleby, replied \"Like a job, in other words?\" and fellow panellist Caroline Lucas added 'welcome to the real world', both of which prompted amusement and applause amongst the audience."]}, {"page": "Khalid Mahmood (British politician)", "response": ["Mahmood was elected as the MP for Birmingham Perry Barr in the 2001 general election, becoming the first Muslim MP in England.
