He is best known for his time at Liverpool, initially from 1993 to 2001. He scored 183 goals in total for Liverpool, earning the nickname \"God\" from the Anfield fans, and he remains Liverpool's top scorer in the Premier League. He subsequently played for Leeds United and Manchester City, before returning to Liverpool in January 2006. He moved to Cardiff City eighteen months later. He played there for a year before transferring to Blackburn Rovers on a short-term deal. In December 2008, he departed Blackburn and played in Australia with North Queensland Fury and Perth Glory. In 2011, he joined Thai side Muangthong United as a player, but later was appointed player-manager, which he remained until his retirement in 2012.\nHe was capped for England 26 times, scoring 7 goals. Fowler was included in England's squads for Euro 1996, Euro 2000 and the 2002 World Cup. Socially aware, Fowler showed support for the Liverpool dockers' strike during a goal celebration in 1997 where he unveiled a t-shirt which incorporated the Calvin Klein \"CK\" into the word doCKer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 9", "response": ["*1975 \u2013 Robbie Fowler, English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.", "response": ["* Ambassadors:  Ian Rush,  Robbie Fowler,  Michael Owen"]}, {"page": "Spice Girls", "response": ["Other notable groups of people have been labelled as some variation of a play-on-words on the Spice Girls' name as an allusion to the band.
