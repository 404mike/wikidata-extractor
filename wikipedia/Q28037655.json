The county club has its origin in the Kent Club founded at Canterbury on 6 August 1842. A similar organisation was formed at Maidstone in 1859 and, in 1870, these two amalgamated to create the present county club. Like the Kent county teams formed by earlier organisations, including the old Town Malling club, the county club has always been classified as a top-class team. The players listed have played for the club in first-class cricket, List A cricket or Twenty20 cricket matches.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Kent player and then his name is given as it would usually appear on modern match scorecards. Note that many players represented other teams besides Kent. Current players are shown as active to the latest year in which they played for the club. The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team. Players who represented the county before August 1842 are included only if they also played for the county club after its initial formation.\n\nAs of 17 July 2021\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Jones", "response": ["Alfred Jones may refer to:", "*Alfred Jones (engraver) (1819\u20131900), English engraver", "*Alfred Jones (football manager) (fl. 1885\u20131915), Small Heath (Birmingham) manager 1892\u20131908", "*Alfred Jones (Kent cricketer), English cricketer", "*Alfred Jones (umpire) (1859\u20131949), cricket test match umpire", "*Alfred Jones (boxer) (born 1946), American Olympic boxer", "*Alfred Jones (footballer, born 1902) (1902\u2013?), English footballer for Crewe Alexandra and Stoke", "*Alfred Jones (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131959), footballer for Wrexham", "*Alfred Jones (Northamptonshire cricketer) (1900\u20131986), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Jones", "response": ["*Alfred Jones (Northamptonshire cricketer) (1900\u20131986)", "*Alfred Jones (Kent cricketer)", "*Alfred Jones (disambiguation)"]}]}}
