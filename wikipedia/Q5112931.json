The 19th-century antiquarian Bishop Stubbs described Adrian IV as, in his view, \"a great pope; that is a great constructive pope, not a controversial one, like those who preceded and followed\". Walter Ullmann argues that Adrian's pontificate \"left an imprint upon contemporary Europe which is not yet fully recognised\". One reviewer has described Adrian's pontificate as, traditionally, \"largely remembered as the answer to a trivia question (who was the only English pope?) or as a footnote in Anglo-Irish history\". On the other hand, the Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History, Christopher N. L. Brooke argues that, on account of the number of different countries he dwelt in over the years, he illustrates the cosmopolitan nature of 12th-century religion."]}, {"page": "Winchester Cathedral", "response": ["*Willis, Robert (1846; 1980) The Architectural History of Winchester Cathedral; by R.

The interdisciplinary approach of the Chadwicks has strongly influenced Celtic studies up to the present day. At Cambridge, Chadwick is notable for having developed the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, and supervised the education of generations of scholars, a large number of whom made major contributions to scholarship."]}, {"page": "Gilbert Foliot", "response": ["Foliot was well known as a letter writer, and his letters were later collected as a book.Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England p. 325 The main manuscript for this collection, now held at the Bodleian Library, is supposed to have originated in Foliot's own writing office.Morey and Brooke \"Introduction\" Letters p. 1 About 250 to 300\u00a0examples of Foliot's letters have survived, which together with his surviving charters gives a total of almost 500\u00a0items.
