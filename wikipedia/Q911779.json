In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to 'go electric' and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"Like a Rolling Stone\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group The Band which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by Manfred Mann (\"The Mighty Quinn\") and Brian Auger, Julie Driscoll & Trinity (\"This Wheel's On Fire\").
