For many years, the general critical consensus on this issue was that the incident revealed an inherent misogyny in the text. For example, Hilary Spurling wrote in 1970, \"Valentine is so overcome [by Proteus' apology] that he promptly offers to hand over his beloved to the man who, not three minutes before, had meant to rape her.\"Program notes for 1970 RSC production of The Two Gentlemen of Verona. Modern scholarship, however, is much more divided about Valentine's actions at the end of the play, with some critics arguing that he does not offer to give Silvia to Proteus at all. The ambiguity lies in the line \"All that was mine in Silvia I give thee\" (5.4.83). Some critics (such as Stanley Wells, for example) interpret this to mean that Valentine is indeed handing Silvia over to her would-be rapist, but another school of thought suggests that Valentine simply means \"I will love you [Proteus] with as much love as I love Silvia,\" thus reconciling the dichotomy of friendship and love as depicted elsewhere in the play. This is certainly how Jeffrey Masten, for example, sees it, arguing that the play as a whole \"reveals not the opposition of male friendship and Petrarchan love but rather their interdependence.\" As such, the final scene \"stages the play's ultimate collaboration of male friendship and its incorporation of the plot we would label \"heterosexual\".\""]}, {"page": "Duff Cooper Prize", "response": ["*1984 \u2013 Hilary Spurling, Ivy When Young: The Early Life of Ivy Compton-Burnett 1884 \u2013 1919"]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["* Hilary Spurling, Matisse the Master: The Conquest of Colour 1909\u20131954 (about Henri Matisse)"]}, {"page": "The Good Earth", "response": ["The Columbia University political scientist Andrew J.
