He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry in April 1897. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, Thynne volunteered for active service and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Imperial Yeomanry on 7 February 1900, leaving Liverpool on the SS Cymric in March 1900 to serve in South Africa with the 1st (Wiltshire) company of the 1st Battalion. He resigned his active commission with the Imperial Yeomanry on 28 July 1902. During the war, he had been promoted a lieutenant in the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry on 13 June 1900, while still in South Africa. He was later a temporary Lieutenant-Colonel in the Service Battalion of the Wiltshire Regiment and served in the Somaliland campaign of 1903 to 1904.\nIn the January 1910 general election he was elected to the House of Commons as one of two representatives for Bath.\nDuring the First World War Thynne was twice wounded in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Croix de Guerre. He was killed in action in France on 14 September 1918, aged 45, whilst commanding 6th (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) Bn. Wiltshire Regiment and was buried at B\u00e9thune Town Cemetery. He never married. He is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. Thynne is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of the life and death of Thynne. Thynne is reported to have been a lover of sculptor, Clare Sheridan, a cousin of Winston Churchill.
