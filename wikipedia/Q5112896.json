Matt Roush of TV Guide panned the film, calling it \"an epic of pathetic miscasting\" and \"laughably inept\". David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that the film is \"so terrible, you'll need to ice your face when it's over to ease the pain of wincing for two hours\" and \"the performances range from barely adequate to terrible. That would be Bowler in the \"barely adequate\" slot and Lohan, well, in the other one.\" Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News noted, based on a consensus of other reviews, that \"it's the howler everyone expected\" and openly mused that the film could end Lohan's acting career. The Hollywood Reporter called Lohan's performance in Liz & Dick \"spectacularly bad\", likening her take on Elizabeth Taylor as \"half train wreck, half SNL skit\". Entertainment Weekly mocked the actress's \"frozen face\" and \"blank stare\" and called the film a \"dinky, tin-eared production\".
