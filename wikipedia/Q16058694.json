He was born and died at Ratby, Leicestershire. Jayes was a right-arm fast bowler and a hard-hitting lower middle-order right-handed batsman; unusually for fast bowlers of the era when he played, he was also rated as a good fielder.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ewart Astill", "response": ["William Ewart Astill (1 March 1888, Ratby, Leicestershire, England \u2013 10 February 1948, Stoneygate, Leicester, England) was, along with George Geary, the mainstay of the Leicestershire team from 1922 to about 1935. He played in nine Test matches but was never picked for a home Test or for an Ashes tour. However, for the best part of three decades he was a vital member of a generally struggling Leicestershire team. With no amateur able to play frequently for the county, Astill became the first officially appointed professional captain of any county for over fifty years in 1935. The county enjoyed a useful season, but at forty-seven years of age, Astill was only a stop gap before an amateur of the required standard and availability could be found.Gentlemen v Players Vol.II M.Marshall He was a nephew of Leicestershire fast bowler Thomas Jayes."]}, {"page": "William Odell", "response": ["Odell took 100 wickets in a season for the first time in 1903 and repeated the feat in the next two seasons. His total of 112 wickets in 1904 was the best of his career and his batting improved markedly that season as well, with his 574 runs at an average of 17.39 being his best aggregate of runs in any one season. In 1906 he failed to reach 100 wickets, but his eight for 20 for Leicestershire against MCC at Lord's was the best innings return of his career. He was back over 100 wickets in 1907, and for the only time in his career he took more than 100 for Leicestershire; the bowling average of 17.72 was the best in his career. He was less successful in 1908, his total number of wickets falling to 74, and after the season was over a short notice in The Times announced that \u201cowing to business engagements Mr. W. W. Odell will not be able to play for Leicestershire next season except during holidays\". That proved true: Odell appeared only against the Australians in 1909, not at all in 1910 and 1911, only in Thomas Jayes\u2019 benefit match in 1912, and then only occasional matches in his last two seasons."]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Thomas Jayes 5/31"]}, {"page": "List of Players cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Thomas Jayes (1906\u20131910)"]}, {"page": "John Shields (cricketer)", "response": ["Shields played first for Leicestershire in 1906 and became a regular player as wicketkeeper in 1907, thereafter playing fairly regularly until the end of the 1910 season. He succeeded Sir Arthur Hazlerigg as captain for the 1911 season with an extremely poor side: Vivian Crawford, a mainstay of the batting, had departed for Sri Lanka and fast bowler Thomas Jayes was able to play only two matches because of the tuberculosis that led to his early death; in addition, Ewart Astill, the other reliable bowler of previous years, lost form so badly that he lost his place in the team. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that \"no one but a sanguine man of happy disposition could have gone through the season at all complacently\". In 24 first-class matches, Leicestershire lost 18 times and gained just a single victory, though they did not finish bottom of the County Championship because Somerset's record was even worse. The single victory was one of the sensational matches of the season: Yorkshire, in the match after Wilfred Rhodes' benefit match, were shot out for just 47 by John King's left-arm medium pace and Leicestershire won by an innings."]}, {"page": "Jayes, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Jayes"]}, {"page": "Jayes", "response": ["* Thomas Jayes (1877\u20131913), English cricket player"]}]}}
