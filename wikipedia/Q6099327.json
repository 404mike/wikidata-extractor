Later in the same year Olivier accepted an invitation to join the Old Vic company. The theatre, in an unfashionable location south of the Thames, had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor Lilian Baylis since 1912. Her drama company specialised in the plays of Shakespeare, and many leading actors had taken very large cuts in their pay to develop their Shakespearean techniques there. Gielgud had been in the company from 1929 to 1931, and Richardson from 1930 to 1932. Among the actors whom Olivier joined in late 1936 were Edith Evans, Ruth Gordon, Alec Guinness and Michael Redgrave. In January 1937 he took the title role in an uncut version of Hamlet, in which once again his delivery of the verse was unfavourably compared with that of Gielgud, who had played the role on the same stage seven years previously to enormous acclaim.

One feels that, if any bird did nest near this cottage, it would be the croaking raven or fatal owl.\" Frank Vosper's performance was described as \"very clever\" and \"a first-rate study of disintegration, in which the muscle of the first act becomes the fearsome flabbiness of the last.

Like Hotspur, who could kill six dozen Scots at breakfast, complain of his quiet life, and then ask for work, she is not one to be concerned about a mere singleton corpse. But she can add quality to quantity in her domestic morgue. In Ten Little Niggers she shows an intense ingenuity in adapting that very lethal rhyme (so oddly deemed a nursery matter) to modern conditions.\" Mr. Brown concluded that Henrietta Watson's portrayal of Emily Brent was, \"the most authentic member of a house party with 'no future in it. played the airmen say.

But Egypt offers the scene-painter a better chance (nicely taken by Danae Gaylen) and the off-stage tattoo of African percussion-music. The piece has the proper excitements of its hard-worked kind; a weakness lies in its blending of the usual mystery-mechanism with unusual human emotion. We have come to take our murders lightly in this kind of theatre; consequently a serious ending, with the guilty party nobly declining an obvious suicide at sacerdotal urgence, the better to find salvation via the scaffold, is too momentous a finale for so light a morsel of play-making. The previous and familiar appurtenance of clue and counter-clue one contentedly accepts: all this is apt enough \u2013 but must there be heaven, too? We leave with a sense of conflict. Has not the Oo-dun-it or Egyptian Butcher-bird been devoured in the last minute, by an 'Allegory on the Banks of the Nile'?\"The Observer 24 March 1946 (p. 2)"]}, {"page": "King's Rhapsody", "response": ["In The Observer, Ivor Brown was of the opinion that Novello, \"can with his tranquility stand up to all the bounding Oklahomans and Brigadooners in the world\"; and in The Sunday Times, Harold Hobson considered it \"a better musical than South Pacific.\""]}, {"page": "Peril at End House (play)", "response": ["Ivor Brown reviewed the play in The Observer's issue of 5 May 1940 when he said, \"Miss Christie knows how to complicate a crime.
