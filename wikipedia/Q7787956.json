General Robert Howe camped near the fort with some 400 men on June 28, 1778, forcing the withdrawal of Lieutenant Thomas Brown and his loyalist East Florida Rangers, who were stationed there as the front line of defense for British East Florida.

Prevost was under orders to stay on the defensive, while Tonyn sought a more vigorous defense.  To that end Tonyn deployed Brown's force along the St. Marys River, which (then as now) formed the border.  Brown and his men, sometimes with support from Creeks and Seminoles, engaged in regular raids into southern Georgia, harassing the defenders and raiding plantations for cattle to supply some of the province's food needs.", "The next day Major Prevost moved out with his, Brown's and McGirth's men, and surprised a Patriot crew repairing a bridge.  Rather than extending themselves, they then decided to retreat, felling trees across the road as they went.  The divisions in the American camps, however, meant that there would be no further advance.  The Continental forces were out of rice, and appealed to the Georgia militia for supplies.  The militia finally crossed the Saint Marys on July 6, adding some strength to the Continental force, which had been reduced by disease and desertion to only 400 effective soldiers.  The shortage of food and the ongoing command disagreements spelled the end of the expedition, which began its retreat on July 14.
