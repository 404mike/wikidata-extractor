She began by performing juvenile r\u00f4les in Manchester, made her debut on the London stage at 20 and a year later New York as a member of the British Blondes which introduced Victorian burlesque to America, where for a few years she would find phenomenal success before her career settled into a long steady decline. \nThe critic Richard Grant White once described Markham's singing as vocal velvet and her arms as the lost arms of the Venus de Milo. Markham had studied singing with Manuel Garc\u00eda at the Royal Academy of Music in London.", "link_mentions": {}}}
