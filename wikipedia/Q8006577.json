Carpenter published Theoretical Astronomy Examined and Exposed \u2013 Proving the Earth not a Globe in eight parts from 1864 under the name Common Sense. He later emigrated to Baltimore, where he published One Hundred Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe in 1885. He wrote: \"There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the level of the sea without falling more than a few feet\u00a0\u2013 notably, the Nile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth's convexity. It is, therefore, a reasonable proof that Earth is not a globe\", as well as: \"If the Earth were a globe, a small model globe would be the very best\u00a0\u2013 because the truest\u00a0\u2013 thing for the navigator to take to sea with him. But such a thing as that is not known: with such a toy as a guide, the mariner would wreck his ship, of a certainty! This is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\""]}, {"page": "William Carpenter (1830-1896)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Carpenter (flat-Earth theorist)"]}, {"page": "William Carpenter (flat Earth theorist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Carpenter (flat-Earth theorist)"]}]}}
