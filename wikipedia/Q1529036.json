Jeff's death began affecting Ash, who develops survivor's guilt which has serious effects on his work. Dixie blames Ash for Jeff's death and after a series of arguments, Dixie tells Ash that he should have died in the explosion and not Jeff. Ash continues to react angrily when a Jehovah's Witness refuses to receive a blood transfusion and when two teenagers constantly put themselves in danger.
