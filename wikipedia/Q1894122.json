Marcus Creed, Capriccio/Target CD, 10169, 1989 Abbado's disc, he wrote, had \"superlative women soloists - Gundula Janowitz at her sweetest and most graceful, Frederica von Stade warm and musicianly as always\". But his opinion of Abbado's tenor and bass was slightly harsher than when he had critiqued them on vinyl. Wies\u0142aw Ochman was now judged to be lacking in charm and no better than adequate, and Kurt Moll was \"rather heavy and clumsy\". The Vienna State Opera Chorus was still \"precise and well-focused\", however. Abbado's conducting had both good points and bad. He elicited a performance that was lively, lucid, polished and nicely phrased, and he was skilled at managing those parts of the score where the 12-year-old Mozart's ideas were least coherent. On the downside, his tempi were sometimes slower than the music called for, and he treated Mozart's less solemn passages too gravely. As for Creed's newer recording, it was true that his line-up of soloists was not as starry as Deutsche Grammophon's. But Celia Linsley, if not blessed with Janowitz's tonal beauty, sang with grace and charm; Werner Hollweg summoned up intensity when required; and Walton Gr\u00f6nroos seemed more at home in the Mass's idiom than Moll did. Although Creed's performance was not as glossy as Abbado's, his sprightlier conducting and Capriccio's inclusion of some worthwhile fill-up items made his disc marginally the more enticing.Gramophone, August 1989, p. 350"]}]}}
