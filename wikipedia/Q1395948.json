She was considered the leading Irish female player of her time.\nMartin started playing tennis in 1885 and early on was successful at the tournaments in Bath and Buxton.  In 1898 she entered the Wimbledon Championships for the first time and, after two wins and two byes, reached the All-comers' final, but was beaten in two sets by Charlotte Cooper. She did not play Wimbledon in 1899 but the following year, 1900, she again reached the All-comer's final to face Cooper and was again defeated but managed to win the second set. Her third and final entry at Wimbledon, in 1901, also ended with a loss in the All-comers' final against Cooper, now playing under her married name Charlotte Sterry.Martin won nine singles titles at the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships between 1889 and 1903 and was a runner-up three times. She won six singles titles at the Northern Championships which was then held alternately in Liverpool and Manchester.With Sydney H. Smith she won two All England Championships mixed doubles titles.She was a member of the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin, who staged the Irish Championships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlotte Cooper (tennis)", "response": ["| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win ||1898 || Wimbledon (3)|| Grass ||  Louisa Martin || 6\u20134, 6\u20134"]}, {"page": "1898 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Women's Singles Championship \u2013 Charlotte Cooper Sterry (GB) defeats Louisa Martin (GB) 6\u20134 6\u20134"]}, {"page": "Lottie Dod", "response": ["In 1886 Dod won the singles title at the West of England Championships in Bath where she defeated Watson in the final, ending the latter's run of 55 consecutive victories. That year she played tournaments in Liverpool (Northern), Cheltenham and Derbyshire but won no further singles titles. In 1887 Dod became an established first-class player, illustrated by the fact she partnered the then seven-time Wimbledon doubles winner Ernest Renshaw at the mixed doubles event of the Irish Championships. She won the singles in Dublin defeating Watson in the final in straight sets. She again won the singles title at the Northern, defeating leading players Louisa Martin, May Langrishe and Watson without losing a set and conceding no more than two games per set.", "After failing to do so in 1889, Dod was determined to win Wimbledon three times in a row, starting in 1891. Although it was her only competitive appearance of that season, she won her third Wimbledon title by defeating Hillyard (6\u20132, 6\u20131) in the final of the All-Comers tournament. The reigning champion Lena Rice did not defend her title. 1892 saw Dod's first singles defeat in an open tournament since 1886 when she lost to Louisa Martin of Ireland in the second round of the Irish Championships. It was the last of only five losses in her entire tennis career and her only defeat after the age of 15. She continued the year strongly, culminating in another easy straight-set Wimbledon victory over Hillyard. Dod's last tennis season as a competitive player was 1893, and she played in just two tournaments, The Northern in Manchester and Wimbledon, winning both. On both occasions, she defeated Blanche Hillyard in three sets, despite a heavy fall in the Wimbledon final. Her record of five Wimbledon titles would not last for long, as Hillyard, after losing in the final to Dod five times, won her sixth title in 1900. Suzanne Lenglen broke Dod's record of three consecutive singles wins by winning from 1919 to 1923."]}, {"page": "Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers", "response": ["In 1900 Douglass made her singles debut at Wimbledon and, after a bye in the first round, lost her second round match to Louisa Martin.
