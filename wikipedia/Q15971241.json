He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1943 for taking part in Operation Chastise \u2013 the Dams raid, while flying with No. 617 Squadron RAF. Knight's crew, flying in N-Nan, attacked, hit and breached the Eder Dam, the second dam to be attacked, after his comrades had previously scored one hit and one miss.\n\nKnight was killed later the same year while taking part in Operation Garlic \u2013 the Dortmund\u2013Ems Canal raid. After his Lancaster's engines were damaged by clipping a tree while flying at low level he was able to allow his entire crew to bail out but was unable to land the aircraft without crashing just outside Den Ham, where there is a memorial. He is remembered by villagers every year on 16th September. He is buried in Den Ham General Cemetery, the Netherlands. There are also two RAF graves next to his. In the 1955 film The Dam Busters, Knight was played by Denys Graham.", "link_mentions": {}}}
