He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1943 for taking part in Operation Chastise \u2013 the Dams raid, while flying with No. 617 Squadron RAF. Knight's crew, flying in N-Nan, attacked, hit and breached the Eder Dam, the second dam to be attacked, after his comrades had previously scored one hit and one miss.\n\nKnight was killed later the same year while taking part in Operation Garlic \u2013 the Dortmund\u2013Ems Canal raid. After his Lancaster's engines were damaged by clipping a tree while flying at low level he was able to allow his entire crew to bail out but was unable to land the aircraft without crashing just outside Den Ham, where there is a memorial. He is remembered by villagers every year on 16th September. He is buried in Den Ham General Cemetery, the Netherlands. There are also two RAF graves next to his. In the 1955 film The Dam Busters, Knight was played by Denys Graham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Dam Busters (film)", "response": ["* Denys Graham as Flying Officer Les Knight, pilot of \"Nancy\""]}, {"page": "Operation Chastise", "response": ["Formation No. 1 was composed of nine aircraft in three groups (listed by pilot): Gibson, Hopgood and Flt Lt H.

He was then posted to No. 106 Squadron RAF, operating Avro Lancasters, and flew the first of his thirty-six sorties over Occupied Europe with the unit in June. On at least four occasions his aircraft was struck by flak. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 12\u00a0January 1943 for \"attacks on industrial targets in enemy territory\". In March he was selected by No.\u00a0106 Squadron's former commanding officer, Wing Commander Guy Gibson, to join the newly formed No.\u00a0617 Squadron for Operation Chastise, the \"Dambusters\" raid on the dams of the Ruhr valley. Shannon was one of four Australian pilots in the squadron\u2014the others being \"Micky\" Martin, Robert Barlow, and Les Knight\u2014and, at twenty, the youngest captain from among all the crews. He cultivated a moustache in an attempt to add maturity to his baby face.", "On the night of Operation Chastise, 16/17\u00a0May 1943, Shannon was among a group of Lancasters led by Gibson in assaults on the M\u00f6hne and Eder Dams. After five of the aircraft had dropped their bouncing bombs on the M\u00f6hne, Shannon was preparing to make his attack on the dam when it gave way, so he carried on to the Eder with Gibson and three other Lancasters, captained by \"Dinghy\" Young, Henry Maudsley, and Les Knight.Sweetman, The Dambusters Raid, pp. 166\u2013167 Detailed for the first bombing run at the Eder, Shannon took several attempts to familiarise himself with the area and line up his aircraft, so in the meantime Gibson ordered Maudsley to make his attack. Shannon went in next, delivering his bomb on target. Knight then dropped his bomb, and the dam broke.Bishop, Bomber Boys, pp. 108\u2013109"]}, {"page": "Leslie Gordon Knight", "response": ["#REDIRECTLes Knight"]}, {"page": "Fred Sutherland (RCAF airman)", "response": ["Sutherland joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in July 1941.
