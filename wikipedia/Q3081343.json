It featured four allegorical figures by L. J. Watts representing engineering, military defence, agriculture and fishery. At the top of the tower the architect placed a large bronze figure representing Saint Helena (the patron saint of Colchester) holding the True Cross. Councillor Arthur Jarmin travelled as far as Italy to locate a suitable statue of the saint, but could only find one of the Virgin Mary, which then had to be modified locally. Just below this statue four bronze ravens by Francis Carruthers Gould could be found, representing the portreeve who ran Colchester's medieval port. A chiming clock with five bells was placed in the tower, with another 15th-century bell which is thought to have hung in the original moot hall. The clock is known locally as Charlie, after Charles Hawkins, who paid for it. "]}]}}
