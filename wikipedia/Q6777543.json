Depending on the wrestler's preference, they may clasp their hands together to secure the hold, as Triple H shows in the adjacent picture. In many cases, the wrestler will drop to the mat and lock the opponent in a bodyscissor lock to make escape even more difficult. The crossface chickenwing is mostly identified with Bob Backlund, who used the hold as a finishing maneuver following his comeback to the WWF in the mid-1990s and won his second world championship using the hold. Backlund's version of the hold incorporates the bodyscissors portion. Daniel Bryan used the move as Bryan Danielson. Marty Scurll uses it as finishing move.
