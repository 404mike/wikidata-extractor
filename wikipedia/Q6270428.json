The campaign was boosted by a 'famous' 2\u20131 victory over top-flight Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup. The cup run and sale of Jones had helped to pull in a record \u00a3410,239 profit. A boost for 1988\u201389 came with the sale of an unused training ground at Cobridge for \u00a3164,800. Halfway through the season, veteran Phil Sproson was advised to retire following a serious knee injury; to replace him, defender Dean Glover was signed from Middlesbrough for a club-record \u00a3200,000. The club finished third, failing to gain automatic promotion because of their worse goal difference.
