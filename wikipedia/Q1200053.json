In 1962, he released an album of songs on Folkways Records titled She Was Poor But She Was Honest after its title track, which included songs drawn from London music halls and pubs.Two years before his death, Lamb appeared, as himself, in the 2004 Oscar-winning animated documentary short film Ryan, directed by Canadian-based animation filmmaker Chris Landreth.\nFrom his first marriage, he had two sons: Richard Steven Lamb (born in London on 27 September 1963) and Thomas Derek Lamb (born in Cambridge on 3 March 1966).

She later moved to Seattle alone to live with her grandparents and cousins. Leaf attended Radcliffe College, which was affiliated with Harvard University, for visual arts from 1964-1968. She had no prior familial implications to film nor was she interested in Cinema until she saw her first European film in university. Initially Leaf wanted to pursue architecture but during her last year of studies enrolled in an animation class as an elective. The class was taught by Derek Lamb and while she could not draw, Lamb encouraged his students to focus on movement and to work under a camera. He requested his students bring an object to class as their focus of animation and Leaf chose beach sand. This is when she created sand animation. Using this technique, she produced her first film Sand, or Peter and the Wolf and was awarded a scholarship from Harvard University. After graduation, she moved to Italy for a year to focus on her drawing. She then completed a Post-doctoral degree at Harvard where she pioneered Paint-on-glass animation. With this technique she produced her second animated film, Orfeo. She then did freelance work and produced How Beaver Stole Fire. During that time, Derek Lamb was hired as head of the English animation department at the National Film Board of Canada. Leaf moved to Montreal to work as an animator for the NFB in 1972. She retired from the NFB in 1992 to pursue documentary film work."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2005", "response": ["*Derek Lamb, 69, British animator, Oscar-winning producer."]}, {"page": "Cartoon Sushi", "response": ["# Incident at Palm Beach by Karl Staven & Derek Lamb"]}, {"page": "52nd Academy Awards", "response": ["*Every Child \u2013 Derek Lamb"]}, {"page": "Every Child (film)", "response": ["*Producer: Derek Lamb", "*Written by: Derek Lamb, Les M\u00eemes \u00c9lectriques", "*In 1980 Derek Lamb won an Oscar for Best Short Film, Animated at the Academy Awards, United States"]}, {"page": "Sports Cartoons", "response": ["Sports Cartoons is an animated series, produced by Derek Lamb and Janet Perlman's Lamb-Perlman Productions in 1985.
