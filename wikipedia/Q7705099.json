The company continued to expand through numerous acquisitions throughout the 2000s. In 2002, it arranged to acquire Lodge (Brothers), a British manufacturer of speed and temperature sensors for aero engines, from Smiths Aerospace. During the following year, Meggitt bought Western Design, which manufactured automated ammunition-handling apparatus and environmental control systems. In 2003, it acquired Caswell International, a provider of high-tech live fire training systems. During 2004, the company, in cooperation with The Carlyle Group, bought the Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group's design and manufacturing divisions; the deal included Dunlop Aerospace Braking Systems, Dunlop Ice Protection & Composites, Dunlop Precision Rubber; Dunlop Equipment, Serck Aviation, and Stewart Warner South Wind. This rapid acquisition rate led to Meggitt's high increases in annual revenue around this period.", "During 2013, Meggitt's finance director, Stephen Young, took over as its CEO following Terry Twigger's retirement. In 2016, Tony Wood joined Meggitt as its CEO, becoming Chief Executive during the following year after Stephen Young's retirement."]}]}}
