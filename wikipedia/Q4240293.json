Sir Robert Wadsley, Lord of the Manor, built a chapel on to the east end of the hall in the 15th\u00a0century; this was partly destroyed in the reign of Elizabeth I although not completely demolished until 1813.\"The Church Above The Bridge\", David Maddock,  Page 9 Gives details of Wadsley Hall Chapel.
