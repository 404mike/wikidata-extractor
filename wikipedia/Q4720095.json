Slabinsky's career high ATP singles ranking was No. 266 (October 2008) and highest doubles ranking is No. 276 (May 2010), and has previously been ranked as the British Men's No.4 in 2008 and 2009.\nSlabinsky played predominantly on the \"Futures\" and \"Challengers\" circuits.  His favourite courts were hard and clay courts, but he did just as well on grass as he produced good form at both Wimbledon Championships and Queens ATP. He has a very strong serve, and gets a large amount of aces in matches. His serve is backed up by good ground strokes and he is solid from both sides. His usual doubles partner is Chris Eaton, another Brit. Alex trains at Roehampton NTC as part of the British Team together with Andy Murray, Alex Bogdanovic and James Ward.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2008 Wimbledon Championships", "response": ["#  Chris Eaton /  Alexander Slabinsky"]}, {"page": "Satoshi Iwabuchi", "response": ["| Alexander Slabinsky"]}, {"page": "2010 ITF Men's Circuit", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"|  Alexander Slabinsky"]}, {"page": "Oliver Golding", "response": ["| Alexander Slabinsky"]}, {"page": "2008 ATP Challenger Series", "response": ["|| Marsel \u0130lhan6\u20134, 6\u20134|| Ivo Klec||rowspan=2| Michail Elgin Colin Ebelthite||rowspan=2| Harel Levy Miles Armstrong Amir Weintraub Alexander Slabinsky", "|| Dieter Kindlmann7\u20136(3), 6\u20133|| Joshua Goodall||rowspan=2| Danai Udomchoke Tsung-Hua Yang||rowspan=2| Jae-Sung An Miles Armstrong Brydan Klein Alexander Slabinsky "]}, {"page": "Chris Eaton (tennis)", "response": ["In June, he had a breakthrough singles win in the 2nd round of qualifying at Nottingham, beating his first top-100 opponent, No. 90 Guillermo Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez, before losing to No. 111 Vince Spadea in the final qualifying round.
