He served with the Royal Australian Navy during World War II. On his return to Australia, he ran a caf\u00e9 in Broome for a period, and then worked in Derby as a stock inspector. Barker entered parliament at the 1952 Legislative Council elections, defeating the sitting Liberal member, Mervyn Forrest, by just five votes. He died in office in July 1956, aged 51. In parliament, he was known for his concern for Aboriginal welfare, and he and his wife (who had no children of their own) often put up visiting Aboriginal students from the North-West at their home in Perth.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
