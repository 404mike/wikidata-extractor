His United debut came in October that year, keeping a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 win at home to Preston North End. He finally became a regular in the United side in the 1923\u201324 season, and was an ever-present the following season as United won promotion, as runners-up, to the First Division. Between April 1924 and September 1927 Steward missed only 7 league games out of a possible 139 for United, before losing his place to Lance Robinson.
