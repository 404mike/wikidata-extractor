Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\". Derek Birley commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as \"gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals\" who were often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\".Birley, pp. 134\u2013135. The odd man out was Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for them. Their best players included Emmett, Ephraim Lockwood, George Ulyett, Ted Peate, Billy Bates and Allen Hill, while Bobby Peel made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and \"rough-hewn image\" had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would \"instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team\"."]}, {"page": "Tom Emmett", "response": ["Born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, Emmett first joined Yorkshire when almost 25 as a professional fast left-arm bowler with a near roundarm action, though in his later years he took to bowling slow-medium. Once discovered, however, Emmett climbed almost immediately to the top of the cricketing tree, playing for England against Surrey & Sussex in Tom Lockyer's benefit match at the Oval in 1867, his second season. An even greater bowler, George Freeman, was approaching his best at the same time, and, from 1867 to the end of 1871, they dominated the English bowling scene. After 1871, however, business commitments took Freeman away from first-class cricket, but Emmett stayed on and found another able colleague in the excellent Allen Hill. In later years, Emmett shared the Yorkshire bowling duties with George Ulyett, Billy Bates, Ted Peate and Bobby Peel. He called his most famous delivery the \"sostenuter\": after pitching on leg the ball would break back a long way to take the off-stump. As time went on, Emmett's pace deserted him."]}, {"page": "Nat Thomson", "response": ["When Australia won the toss on 15 March 1877 and elected to bat, Nat Thomson came out with Australia's No. 1 batsman Charles Bannerman to form the first-ever Test batting partnership. Thomson was 37 years 290 days old, which made him the second-oldest player on the ground behind England's James Southerton, who remains to this day the oldest Test debutant ever. Thomson has the distinction of being the first batsman dismissed in a Test match, when he was clean bowled by England's Allen Hill for 1 when the score was 2. In the Second Test a fortnight later he made 41 in the second innings, adding 88 for the first wicket with Dave Gregory."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Allen Hill||||1||1890||1890"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Allen Hill \u00b7"]}, {"page": "A Hill", "response": ["*Allen Hill (Hugh Allen Oliver Hill) (1937\u20132021), British chemist and academic", "*Allen Hill (1845\u20131910), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Kirkheaton", "response": ["* England cricketers George Herbert Hirst, Allen Hill and Wilfred Rhodes were born in the village and played cricket for Kirkheaton Cricket Club.
