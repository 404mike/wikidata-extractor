Finding that Cornwallis was now Lord Lieutenant and Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, the pair travelled overland to Dublin, where Abu Taleb visited and presumably made representations to Cornwallis. It is clear that work in the early 1770s with Nathaniel Middleton had damaged Abu Taleb's standing in Oudh, where he was depicted by rivals as supporting British interests at the cost of those of the Nawab; and it is most likely that Abu Taleb sought recompense from the company.
