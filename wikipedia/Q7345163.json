The Trustees administered the Duke's estate, which included coal mines at Worsley and the Bridgewater Canal.\nRobert Haldane Bradshaw was the eldest son of Thomas Bradshaw, who became Secretary to the Treasury and his wife Elizabeth Wilson, daughter of Robert Wilson, of Woodford, Essex and merchant of London.  It is possible that Robert was educated at Harrow and he later entered public service.  By 1800 he was agent to the Duke of Bridgewater.\nIn 1802 the Duke appointed him as Member of Parliament for the pocket borough of Brackley and he retained this position until it was disenfranchised by the Reform Act of 1832. From 1825 until abolition he shared representation of the two-member seat with his own son, James, a Royal Navy captain, who committed suicide during his father's lifetime in 1833.On the death of the Duke in 1803, his estate was vested in three Trustees, Bradshaw being appointed Superintendent.  Bradshaw was totally responsible for running the estate, the other two being \"dummy trustees\".  Following the death of the Duke, the income from the Bridgewater Trust went to his nephew George Leveson-Gower, the Marquess of Stafford (later the 1st Duke of Sutherland).  On his death it was to go to Stafford's second son Francis Egerton.Bradshaw was reluctant to leave London, where his home was close to the Duke's house, Bridgewater House.  While running the Bridgewater estate, he complained of being over-worked, although this was largely due to his inability to delegate. His personality was \"intensely conservative\", while he had the reputation of being a \"formidable negotiator\".  In November 1831 he suffered a stroke, which affected his left arm and leg and which impaired his business judgement.  The Duke of Sutherland died in 1833 and following a disagreement between Bradshaw and Francis Egerton, Bradshaw was persuaded to retire in 1834.  He retired to Kings Langley and died there a year later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liverpool and Manchester Railway", "response": ["The first survey for the line was carried out by James in 1822. The route was roughly the same as what was built, but the committee were unaware of exactly what land had been surveyed. James subsequently declared bankruptcy and was imprisoned that November. The committee lost confidence in his ability to plan and build the line and, in June 1824, George Stephenson was appointed principal engineer.  As well as objections to the proposed route by Lords Sefton and Derby, Robert Haldane Bradshaw, a trustee of the Duke of Bridgewater's estate at Worsley, refused any access to land owned by the Bridgewater Trustees and Stephenson had difficulty producing a satisfactory survey of the proposed route and accepted James' original plans with spot checks."]}, {"page": "Bridgewater Canal", "response": ["The Duke of Bridgewater died on 8 March 1803.

The management of the company was placed in the hands of three trustees. These were Sir Archibald Macdonald, who was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, at the time the Bishop of Carlisle and later the Archbishop of York, and, as Superintendent, Robert Haldane Bradshaw, the Duke's agent. Bradshaw managed the estate, for which he received a salary of \u00a32,000 a year and the use of the duke's mansions at Worsley and Runcorn.
