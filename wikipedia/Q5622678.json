He was captain of Derbyshire from 1951 to 1954 and also played for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).\nWillatt was born at The Park, Nottingham.  He was educated at Repton School and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He played cricket for Cambridge University, two years before the war and at the same time performed in the second and first team at Nottinghamshire. However his university education was interrupted by the Second World War, when he served as an officer in the Royal Artillery. He still played for Nottinghamshire teams during the war. He resumed his studies at Cambridge and in 1947 was a football blue as well as captaining Cambridge University. He scored 90 in the Varsity Match that year.  He continued playing for Nottinghamshire in the years immediately after the war.\nOn leaving university he moved to Edinburgh, where he taught at Edinburgh Academy and scored for The Grange. While he was in Scotland from 1948 to 1950 he played four times for Scotland.\nIn 1950 Willatt returned from Scotland to teach at Repton and, like John Eggar and Dick Sale, combined cricket for Derbyshire with his teaching career. He was also released from teaching in the summer term so he could captain the county. He was designated captain in the 1950 season but was hampered by injury and Pat Vaulkhard substituted for him in the role while on the field Willatt was an unpredictable, middle-order batsman during his first season. He took over as captain in the 1951 season and occupied the post for the next three years, in which he played consistently for the team. He scored a century against his former team Nottinghamshire in 1951 and Derbyshire finished eleventh in the County Championship. In 1952, which was his personal best season, Willatt scored 1,624 runs, at an average of 35.3 including two centuries and the club were fourth in the Championship. In the 1953 season Willatt's batting average dropped, and Derbyshire slipped to sixth.  Willatt scored centuries against Kent and Sussex in the 1954 season and the club finished third in the county table.\nIn 1954 Willatt left Repton for Heversham Grammar School in Westmoreland, but continued playing for Derbyshire. In the 1955 season Willatt played five games for Derbyshire, and in his last season, 1956, he played four. Willatt played cricket for the MCC between 1951 and 1970 playing a first-class game against Ireland in 1961. He was also playing for Kendal Cricket Club.\nWillatt was a left-handed batsman and played 303 innings in 185 first-class matches at an average of 29.10 and a top score of 146. He was a right-arm slow bowler and took three first-class wickets at an average of 45.00 and a best performance of 2 for 18. Off the field, Willatt was a moderniser who eliminated amateur-professional segregation at the club\nWillatt became headmaster at Pocklington School, Yorkshire, in 1966 where he stayed until his retirement in 1980. He then returned to Derbyshire to live, becoming chairman of the Derbyshire Cricket committee from 1986 to 1990 and president of the club in 1995.Willatt and his wife Marion were married for ? years until her death. They had three sons. He died at Derby aged 85.Willatt's son, Jonathan, played first-class cricket for Cambridge University in 1989. Willatt had two elder brothers: Sir Hugh Willatt was a former secretary general to the Arts Council, and Geoffrey Willatt, a veteran of the prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Dews", "response": ["His bowling was of the strictly occasional variety, but he did claim two first-class wickets, both in 1954, including that of Derbyshire captain Guy Willatt."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Nottinghamshire, captained for the first time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946.Playfair, pp. 102\u2013103.
