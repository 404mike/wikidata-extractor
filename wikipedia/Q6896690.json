According to Michael Azerrad's 1993 Nirvana biography Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana, the band's singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain was opposed to the release of the track, feeling that this version was not strong. However, the single constituted part of the band's buyout deal from their former record label, Sub Pop Records. \"Candy/Molly's Lips\" was Nirvana's final release on Sub Pop Records.
