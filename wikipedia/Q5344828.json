He was among the first to warn of desertification and desiccation and wrote on \"The encroaching Sahara\". \nIn 1935, he wrote of the \"desert whose power is incalculable and whose silent and almost invisible approach must be difficult to estimate.\" He suggested that this was man-made and this led to a joint Anglo-French forestry mission from December 1936 to February 1937 that toured northern Nigeria and Niger to assess the danger of desertification.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Conservation movement", "response": ["Conservation was revived in the mid-19th century, with the first practical application of scientific conservation principles to the forests of India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the environment, that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments.Stebbing, E.P (1922)The forests of India vol. 1, pp. 72-81 Edward Percy Stebbing warned of desertification of India. The Madras Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by Alexander Gibson, a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world."]}, {"page": "Stebbing (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Edward Percy Stebbing (1872\u20131960), pioneering British forester and forest entomologist in India"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (S)", "response": ["* Stebbing \u2013 Edward Percy Stebbing (1872\u20131960)"]}]}}
