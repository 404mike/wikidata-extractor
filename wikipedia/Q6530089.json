Two more singles from the Love album followed; \"Rain\" (charting in the UK at No.\u00a017) and \"Revolution\" (charting in the UK at No.\u00a030). Neither charted in the US. Another single, \"Nirvana\", was issued only in Poland. The album version of \"Rain\", as well as the remix \"(Here Comes the) Rain\", were used in the Italian horror film D\u00e8moni 2. Once back in England, the band booked themselves into the Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, with producer Steve Brown (who had produced Love), and recorded over a dozen new songs. The band were unhappy with the sound of their new album, titled Peace, and they decided to go to New York so producer Rick Rubin could remix the first single, \"Love Removal Machine\"."]}, {"page": "Electric (The Cult album)", "response": ["*Les Warner \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Pure Cult: The Singles 1984\u20131995", "response": ["*Les Warner \u2013 drums, tracks 3, 7, 13"]}, {"page": "Cheetah Chrome", "response": ["In the Fall of 2009, Chrome got together with old friend Sylvain Sylvain to record an EP on the suggestion of SmogVeil Records head Frank Mauceri. They recruited Thommy Price and Enzo Pennizotto from the Blackhearts as a rhythm section, naming themselves the Batusis after the dance from the hit 60s TV show \"Batman\".  They performed two shows at SXSW 2010; Price and Penizzotto were unable to do live shows with the Batusis, due to their schedule with Joan Jett, and were replaced by Chuck Garric of Alice Cooper's band on bass, and Les Warner, formerly of The Cult, on drums. The four song (\"Big Cat Stomp/What You Lack in Brains/Bury You Alive/ Blues Theme\") EP was released in May 2010.  A UK tour had to be cancelled due to a volcanic eruption in Iceland, but they toured the US extensively through December 2010 with Warner on drums and another former Blackheart, Sean Koos, on bass.
