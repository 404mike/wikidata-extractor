Ward also played seven Test matches for England, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1890.\nWard, the son of a coal miner, was born in the colliers village of Waterloo near Rothwell,  Leeds, Yorkshire, England. He played four matches for Yorkshire, and his debut was against Middlesex at Bradford Park Avenue in 1886, where he made his highest score of 22. He was not able to sustain a place in the Yorkshire side but, after moving to live in Lancashire, he began a successful career for that county. In total he played 330 matches between 1889 and 1904, with his benefit match in 1902 being worth \u00a31,739. He was the first professional to score 1,000 runs in a single season for Lancashire and repeated this eight times. The best being in 1900, when he scored 1,511 at average of 37.77. During his career he played in seven Tests for England against Australia. Ward's highest first-class score was 219 for the Stoddart team against South Australia, at Adelaide in 1895. His highest Test score was 117 versus Australia, made in Sydney in 1894.\nHe was an opening batsman with a powerful defence, who drove the ball hard, but preferred to play defensive roles.  He was also a good outfielder.\nA school teacher by profession, Ward also owned a sports outfitters shop in Bolton at one time. His early cricket was with Hunslet C.C.and he was known as the 'Rothwell Colt' in his early career.Ward died in Heaton, Bolton, Lancashire, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Temple Newsam", "response": ["In 1815, William Fenton, one of the 'Coal Kings' of Yorkshire, began the sinking of a mine shaft on the estate at Thorpe Stapleton.  The colliery was named Waterloo to commemorate the famous battle of that year. Waterloo Colliery was operated as a royalty concession with contracted 'rents' for coal extracted going to the Temple Newsam landowner. Fenton also had a village built for his workers on land between the River Aire and the Aire and Calder navigation. The village was initially called Newmarket but then became Irwin Square on ordnance survey maps and Ingram Place on census lists, but it was commonly simply known as Waterloo. The Yorkshire, Lancashire and England cricketer Albert Ward was born here in 1865.  The village had two rows of cottages and a school building. It was connected to the colliery by a wooden footbridge over the river. Deep coal mining on the estate ended with the closure of the Temple Pit of Waterloo Main Colliery in 1968. thumb|right|Temple Newsam HouseOpencast mining on the estate began in May 1942. Seven sites were exploited to the south of the house almost entirely destroying Capability Brown's landscape. One site reached within  of the South Terrace.
