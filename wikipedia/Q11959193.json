He held the Professorship of Chinese at the University of Cambridge from 1933 to 1938.\nMoule was born on 18 May 1873 in Hangzhou, China. His father was missionary George Moule (1828\u20131912), the first Anglican bishop of mid-China. Moule's uncles Arthur Evans Moule (1836-1918) and George Evans Moule were also Anglican missionaries in China, and so were many of Moule's six siblings. Another uncle, the theologian Handley Moule (1841\u20131920), became Bishop of Durham. Arthur Christopher was uncle to the famous Cambridge theologian and New Testament scholar C. F. D. Moule.\nMoule was educated at The King's School in Canterbury and Trinity College, Cambridge. He trained as an architect and returned to China to work there, but ended up following his family into missionary work, being ordained in 1904 as a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He served in northern China for four years before returning to England. In 1918 he received the living of Trumpington just outside of Cambridge, where he could continue his scholarly work on Chinese subjects.Moule died on 5 June 1957 in St Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, England.", "link_mentions": {}}}
