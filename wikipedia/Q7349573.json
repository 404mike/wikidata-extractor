He was British flat racing Champion Owner five times.From the mid-1970s, in partnership with John Magnier and Vincent O'Brien, Sangster transformed the sport of thoroughbred horseracing.  Their dramatic buying of American-bred yearlings at the Keeneland Sales in Kentucky led to tremendous success and established the Coolmore Stud in Ireland as one of the principal powers in the bloodstock world.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Epsom Derby", "response": ["| Robert Sangster", "| Robert Sangster"]}, {"page": "Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe", "response": ["| Robert Sangster", "| Robert Sangster", "| Robert Sangster"]}, {"page": "Northern Dancer", "response": ["Former Keeneland chairman Ted Bassett wrote in his autobiography that between 1974 and 1988, the sons and daughters of Northern Dancer fetched the highest prices of all sires at the yearling sales 12 times, \"and that constitutes a record that may last forever.\" Northern Dancer's yearlings also led the Keeneland July Selected Yearling Sale by average price 12 times in the same period.

The combination of Vincent O'Brien's incredible gift for picking world class horses and John Magnier's business mind propelled Coolmore Stud to the top of the racing world, boasting greater assets than any other racing stud in Europe, the Middle East, or America. The key to the success was through use of the bloodline of a Canadian-bred horse named Northern Dancer, who had won a Kentucky Derby. One son of Northern Dancer was the British Triple Crown winner, Nijinsky, probably the best horse O'Brien ever trained. Nijinsky was ranked the best ever winner of the Epsom Derby by a panel of experts assembled by the Daily Telegraph in 2018.Why Nijinsky rules supreme as the greatest champion\u201d.
