His massive and reputation-making thesis, Les paysans du Nord (1924), was an account of the Revolution among provincial peasants. He continued to research along these lines, publishing The Great Fear of 1789 (1932, first English translation 1973), about the panic and violence which spread throughout rural France in the summer of 1789. His work largely approaches the Revolution \"from below\", favouring explanations in terms of classes. His most famous work was Quatre-Vingt-Neuf (literally Eighty-Nine, published in 1939 and translated into English as The Coming of the French Revolution, 1947). This skilfully and persuasively argued work interprets the Revolution through a Marxist lens: first there is the \"aristocratic revolution\" of the Assembly of Notables and the Paris Parlement in 1788; then the \"bourgeois revolution\" of the Third Estate; the \"popular revolution\", symbolised by the fall of the Bastille; and the \"peasant revolution\", represented by the \"Great Fear\" in the provinces and the burning of ch\u00e2teaux. (Alternately, one can view 1788 as the aristocratic revolution, 1789 the bourgeois revolution, and 1792/3 the popular revolution). This interpretation sees a rising capitalist middle-class overthrow a dying-out feudal aristocratic ruling caste, and held the field for almost twenty years.William Doyle.

The decree specified that the city itself was to be destroyed. Following the decree, Couthon established special courts to supervise the demolition of the richest homes in Lyon and leave the homes of the poor untouched.William Doyle, The Oxford History of the French Revolution (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 253-254. In addition to the demolition of the city, the decree dictated that the rebels and the traitors were to be executed. Couthon had difficulty accepting the destruction of Lyon and proceeded slowly with his orders. Eventually, he would find that he could not stomach the task at hand, and by the end of October, he requested the National Convention to send a replacement.Mansfield, Paul. \"The Repression of Lyon 1793-4: Origins, Responsibility and Significance.\" French History, 1988: 74-101.

The election of the National Convention took place in September 1792 after the election of the electoral colleges by primary regional assemblies on 26 August. Owing to the abstention of aristocrats and the anti-republicans, and the general fear of victimization, the voter turnout in the departments was low \u2013 as little as 7.5 percent or as much as 11.9% of the electorate, compared to 10.2% in the 1791 elections, despite the doubling of the number of eligible voters.William Doyle, The Oxford History of the French Revolution, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1990, here.

The old nobility of landed or knightly origin, the noblesse d'\u00e9p\u00e9e, increasingly resented the influence and pretensions of this parvenu nobility. In the last years of the ancien r\u00e9gime the old nobility pushed for restrictions of certain offices and orders of chivalry to noblemen who could demonstrate that their lineage had extended \"quarterings\", i.e. several generations of noble ancestry, to be eligible for offices and favours at court along with nobles of medieval descent, although historians such as William Doyle have disputed this so-called \"Aristocratic Reaction\".W. Doyle, Essays on Eighteenth Century France, London, 1995 Various court and military positions were reserved by tradition for nobles who could \"prove\" an ancestry of at least seize quartiers (16 quarterings), indicating exclusively noble descent (as displayed, ideally, in the family's coat of arms) extending back five generations (all 16 great-great grandparents)."]}, {"page": "F\u00e9don's rebellion", "response": ["The rebels maintained a world view of events, and a comment from one of Fedon's deputies acknowledges this: \"Liberty can never be confined solely to the dominions of France, but must gradually extend to every corner of the globe, when it will the interest of mankind to unite and totally terminate that perfidious race\". Communication was maintained with fellow revolutionaries in Haiti, Guadaloupe and St Lucia, although this was a somewhat \"uneasy relationship\", suggests Martin, as F\u00e9don, on the one hand, wanted as much assistance as he could receive, but on the other was wary of allowing external forces too much influence within his movement. In June 1794 Victor Hugues had been sent by the National Convention to promulgate the Decree of 16 Pluv\u00f4ise, which\u2014\"reluctantly and belatedly\", says William Doyle\u2014abolished slavery in all French colonies. Making his base in Guadeloupe, Hugues' mission part of a French strategy to both regain her colonies earlier lost to Britain and from Britain capture new territories. This would be achieved by organising those who already had a  historic French connection, and those whose populations were dissatisfied under British rule: Grenada, says Jacobs, \"qualified on both counts\". As a result Hugues was particularly vociferous in spurring the F\u00e9dons on, but found he had little sway over F\u00e9don, whom he called hot-headed. F\u00e9don, though, increasingly ignored the exhortations of his comrades elsewhere to unity and enforced his own strategy and discipline. F\u00e9don and Philip both had siblings who had emigrated to Trinidad prior to the rebellion and it is probable that they also provided external support for the rebels; one brother-in-law, Michael Belleran, organised a support network from there."]}]}}
