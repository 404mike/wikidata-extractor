The Darmstadt Artists' Colony and Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte provided perhaps the most significant input to the trend, while in Denmark Georg Jensen, though best known for his Silverware, also contributed significant pieces. In England, Liberty & Co., (notably through the Cymric designs of Archibald Knox) and the British arts & crafts movement of Charles Robert Ashbee contributed slightly more linear but still characteristic designs. The new style moved the focus of the jeweller's art from the setting of stones to the artistic design of the piece itself. Lalique's dragonfly design is one of the best examples of this. Enamels played a large role in technique, while sinuous organic lines are the most recognisable design feature."]}, {"page": "Art Nouveau", "response": ["File:Necklace (3922815556).jpg|Necklace by Charles Robert Ashbee (1901)"]}, {"page": "Victoria and Albert Museum", "response": ["The collection includes pieces by William Kent, Henry Flitcroft, Matthias Lock, James Stuart, William Chambers, John Gillow, James Wyatt, Thomas Hopper, Charles Heathcote Tatham, Pugin, William Burges, Charles Voysey, Charles Robert Ashbee, Baillie Scott, Edwin Lutyens, Edward Maufe, Wells Coates and Robin Day.

The resulting house has been described as \"one of the most important late 19th century country houses in England\", and is Bodley and Garner's most significant country house. The house was hugely expensive and building was undertaken at a leisurely pace. The foundations were laid in 1884, and the Windsor-Clives moved in in 1891, when the house was still incomplete. The building was technologically advanced; one of the first in the country to be lit by electricity and with hydraulic lifts powered from the water tower in the park. The Windsor-Clives entertained at Hewell on an appropriate scale, with guests including Lord Salisbury, the Shah of Persia, and many members of the British Royal Family. Ferdinand de Rothschild, the builder of the even grander Waddesdon Manor and another Soul, suggested that Hewell was the only modern English house he really envied. But the house was obsolete almost as it was being built.

Arts and crafts jewelry also tended to favor materials with little intrinsic value that could be used for their artistic effects.
