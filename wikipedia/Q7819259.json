In October 1942, as a NAAFI canteen assistant, he was involved in the action between Petard and U-559, being one of three men to board the sinking submarine in an effort to retrieve vital documents, and was the only one of the three to survive. These documents would later lead the Bletchley Park codebreakers to crack the German Enigma code. After this heroic deed, it was revealed that he was underage to be at sea. He returned home to North Shields. In 1945 he died from injuries sustained while rescuing his sister Maureen from a house fire in North Shields Ridges Estate whilst on leave from HMS Belfast. His family were presented with his medal by King George VI in 1945, and later presented it to the NAAFI in 1985.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Enigma (2001 film)", "response": ["In the film, Cave, from Naval Intelligence, played by Matthew Macfadyen, mentioned Fasson and Grazier gave their lives to rescue the code books from a sinking submarine.

Fasson and Grazier did drown while attempting to retrieve electrical equipment from a U-boat U-559 (which Cave describes as its four-rotor enigma) on 30 October 1942, while Brown survived only to die in a house fire during shore-leave before the end of the war.The Documents recovered from U559 - at a price, The Breaking of German Naval Enigma by Tony Sale Retrieved 25 November 2017The boarding of U-559 changed the war \u2013 now both sides tell their story, The Guardian, 21 Oct 2017 Retrieved 25 November 2017Teen who rescued Enigma codes from sinking sub died in house fire without knowing the significance of his bravery, The Mirror, 27 Jan 2017 Retrieved 25 November 2017 Fasson and Grazier were awarded the George Cross posthumously and Brown was awarded the George Medal.Allied Breaking of Naval Enigma, uboat.net Retrieved 25 November 2017 Fictional character Cave states he was completing his last posting on a destroyer, in November '42, when the books were acquired."]}, {"page": "Colin Grazier", "response": ["Fasson stripped off his clothes and jumped into the cold sea.
