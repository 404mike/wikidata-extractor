War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s.  Its popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and commercial success of  Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea (1953). Like others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the battle of the Atlantic. Others, like The Dam Busters (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. The Dam Busters became the most popular film in Britain in 1955,\"'The Dam Busters'.\" Times [London, England], 29 December 1955, p. 12 via The Times Digital Archive.

A large number of war films were made in the 1955\u201358 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One That Got Away and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year, and Paths of Glory were released. Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war. The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By the end of the decade the \"sense of shared achievement\" which had been common in war films \"began to evaporate\", according to Pulver."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Film Editing", "response": ["| Charles Frend"]}, {"page": "American International Pictures", "response": ["| Torpedo Bay || War || Charles FrendBruno Vailati"]}, {"page": "Romney Marsh", "response": ["The 1947 British historical drama film The Loves of Joanna Godden, based on the novel by Sheila Kaye-Smith and directed by Charles Frend, is set in Romney Marsh."]}, {"page": "Submarine films", "response": ["* Beta Som (Torpedo Bay) (1963) \u2013 Italian-French drama directed by Charles Frend and Bruno Vailati, depicting a British warship and Italian submarine operating in the Strait of Gibraltar and meeting in the neutral Rick's Cafe; a.k.a.
