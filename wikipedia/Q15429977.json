Soon he left Krak\u00f3w for Warsaw, where he studied philosophy, economics and  Marxism. Around 1927, he joined the illegal Communist Party of Poland (KPP) and became the editor of the party's underground press. He wrote for the Jewish Nasz Przegl\u0105d (\"Our Review\") and for the Marxist Miesi\u0119cznik Literacki (\"The Literary Monthly\").Marci Shore, Caviar and Ashes, p. 68. Yale University Press, New Haven, 2006. . In 1931 he toured the Soviet Union, seeing the economic conditions under the first Five Year Plan. The University of Moscow and the University of Minsk offered him posts as professor of history of socialism and of Marxist theory, but he declined the offers and returned to Poland. Deutscher co-founded the first anti-Stalinist group in the Communist Party of Poland, protesting the party view that Nazism and social democracy were \"not antipodes but twins.\" This contradicted the then official communist line, according to which social democrats were \"social fascists\", the greatest enemies of the communist party. In an article \"The Danger of Barbarism over Europe\", Deutscher urged the formation of a united front of socialists and communists against Nazism. He was expelled from the KPP in 1932, officially for \"exaggerating the danger of Nazism and spreading panic in the communist ranks.\"Tamara Deutscher (1968), \"Isaac Deutscher 1907 \u2013 1967\", Preface to The Non-Jewish Jew & Other Essays.David Caute, Isaac and Isaiah, pp. 99\u2013106.", "Deutscher wrote: \"Religion? I am an atheist. Jewish nationalism? I am an internationalist. In neither sense am I therefore a Jew. I am, however, a Jew by force of my unconditional solidarity with the persecuted and exterminated. I am a Jew because I feel the pulse of Jewish history; because I should like to do all I can to assure the real, not spurious, security and self-respect of the Jews.\"Deutscher, Isaac. \"Who is a Jew?\" In The Non-Jewish Jew and Other Essays, p. 51.
