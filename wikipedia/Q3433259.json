In 1871, a revised version was published in Church Hymns. Gurney expressed his open dissent against the new arrangement in a letter to Church Times. John Ellerton, one of the editors of  Church Hymns, responded to this in 1881 by appending a statement that \"the variations in this hymn amount to an almost complete recasting of it. The fine conception of the hymn was grievously marred by faulty execution, and sincere thanks are due to the author for permitting his original to be so daringly manipulated\". A third version of the hymn was published in 1875 in Hymns Ancient and Modern, again against the wishes of Gurney.  The latter two versions were sent to the United States, which gained the hymn awareness there. Gurney's original musical composition received little attention beyond his original self-publication.
