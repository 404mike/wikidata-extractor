Harper was a prolific goalscorer in the few years he was at the club; his 36 league goals scored in a season in 1930\u201331 remained a record until 1963, when it was broken by Jimmy Greaves. The stress of being manager affected Minter's health; he resigned, and was given another position at the club in November 1929.  Percy Smith was appointed manager at the start of 1930, and he strengthened the team with imported and home-grown talents including George Hunt, Willie Hall and Arthur Rowe.  The team, aided by the goal-scoring exploits of Hunt, were nicknamed the \"Greyhounds\" in the 1932\u201333 season as they raced up the Second Division from near the bottom of the table, and won promotion after finishing second to Stoke City. Spurs only managed to stay in Division One for two seasons; injuries (especially to Rowe and Hall) left the team weakened and at the bottom of the table in the 1934\u201335 season by April 1935. Smith then resigned, claiming that the club's directors had interfered with his team selection.", "Jack Tresadern took over from caretaker manager Wally Hardinge in July 1935, but failed to lift the club out of the Second Division in the three years of his tenure. He promoted centre-forward Johnny Morrison in place of fans' favourite George Hunt, and decided to sell Hunt to rival Arsenal in 1937, a decision that made him unpopular. He left in April 1938 for Plymouth Argyle when it became apparent that he would likely be sacked at the end of the season. Peter McWilliam was brought back as manager, and he tried to rebuild the team by promoting young players from Northfleet including Nicholson, Burgess and Ditchburn, but his second stint at the club was again interrupted by world war. Spurs also failed to advance beyond the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in the 1930s, getting that far three years running from 1935 to 1938. Despite Tottenham's lack of success in this period, 75,038 spectators still squeezed into White Hart Lane in March 1938 for a cup tie against Sunderland\u2014the club's largest gate until it was surpassed in 2016 when more than 85,000 attended the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League home match against Monaco held at Wembley Stadium."]}, {"page": "George Hunt (forward)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Hunt (footballer, born 1910)"]}]}}
