McLennan delivered the Guthrie lecture to the Physical Society in 1918. With his graduate student, Gordon Merritt Shrum, he built a helium liquefier at the University of Toronto. They were the second in the world to successfully produce liquid helium in 1923, 15 years after Heike Kammerlingh Onnes. In 1926, he was awarded the Royal Society of Canada's Flavelle Medal and in 1927 a Royal Medal.\nHe died in 1935 near Abbeville in France on a train from Paris to London of a heart attack.
