One of his most famous works is Some Principles of Maritime Strategy, which remains a classic among students of naval warfare. Corbett was a good friend and ally of naval reformer Admiral John \"Jacky\" Fisher, the First Sea Lord.  He was chosen to write the official history of British Naval operations during World War I.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Jutland", "response": ["* Lambert, Andrew. \"Writing Writing the Battle: Jutland in Sir Julian Corbett's Naval Operations,\" Mariner's Mirror 103#2 (2017) 175\u201395, Historiography.."]}, {"page": "Carl von Clausewitz", "response": ["Clausewitz's influence spread to British thinking as well, though at first more as a historian and analyst than as a theorist. See for example Wellington's extended essay discussing Clausewitz's study of the Campaign of 1815\u2014Wellington's only serious written discussion of the battle, which was widely discussed in 19th-century Britain. Clausewitz's broader thinking came to the fore following Britain's military embarrassments in the Boer War (1899\u20131902). One example of a heavy Clausewitzian influence in that era is Spenser Wilkinson, journalist, the first Chichele Professor of Military History at Oxford University, and perhaps the most prominent military analyst in Britain from c. 1885 until well into the interwar period. Another is naval historian Julian Corbett (1854\u20131922), whose work reflected a deep if idiosyncratic adherence to Clausewitz's concepts and frequently an emphasis on Clausewitz's ideas about 'limited objectives' and the inherent strengths of the defensive form of war. Corbett's practical strategic views were often in prominent public conflict with Wilkinson's\u2014see, for example, Wilkinson's article \"Strategy at Sea,\" The Morning Post, 12 February 1912. Following the First World War, however, the influential British military commentator B. H. Liddell Hart in the 1920s erroneously attributed to him the doctrine of \"total war\" that during the First World War had been embraced by many European general staffs and emulated by the British. More recent scholars typically see that war as so confused in terms of political rationale that it in fact contradicts much of On War. That view assumes, however, a set of values as to what constitutes \"rational\" political objectives\u2014in this case, values not shaped by the fervid Social Darwinism that was rife in 1914 Europe. One of the most influential British Clausewitzians today is Colin S. Gray; historian Hew Strachan (like Wilkinson also the Chichele Professor of Military History at Oxford University, since 2001) has been an energetic proponent of the study of Clausewitz, but his own views on Clausewitz's ideas are somewhat ambivalent."]}, {"page": "List of military writers", "response": ["* Julian Corbett \u2013 Edwardian British Naval theorist, Some Principles of Maritime Strategy"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Julian Corbett (1854\u20131922), British naval"]}, {"page": "Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)", "response": ["The British had let the raid occur and appeared to the public to have been surprised (having been forewarned by decoded wireless messages) and then to have failed to sink the German raiding force on its way back to Germany.
