At 15 he won schoolboy international honours as a right half and signed professional forms with Stoke in January 1939. The outbreak of World War II soon gave opportunities to Stoke's apprentices and Franklin made his senior debut at the end of 1939\u201340, before volunteering with the Royal Air Force in February 1941. He converted to centre back due to the absence of Billy Mould and also took his place of captain. Franklin thrived in his new-found position and his positioning and tackling ability was described by the press as 'perfection'. Franklin helped remove the stereotype of centre backs as being just stoppers as he was very comfortable on the ball and earned his first England cap in February 1945. His goalkeeper Dennis Herod was often left frustrated by Franklin's genius. \"He was a great player, but so unpredictable. If he was under pressure he would shout to me Dennis, come on and I would come out expecting him to give me the ball. Nine times out of ten he would do a u-turn and trot off up the field. It was like playing in a minefield. He didn't believe he could have a bad game and was the only one who didn't suffer with nerves.\""]}, {"page": "1937\u201338 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "William Mould", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1938\u201339 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1951\u201352 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1939\u201340 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Billy Mould (1919\u20131999), played for Stoke City."]}, {"page": "1940\u201341 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1941\u201342 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1942\u201343 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1944\u201345 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "1945\u201346 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Mould"]}, {"page": "Mould (surname)", "response": ["* Billy Mould (1919-1999), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 1999", "response": ["*Billy Mould, 79, English footballer."]}]}}
