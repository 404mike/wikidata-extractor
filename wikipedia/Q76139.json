From 1983 to 1992 and from 1997 to 2011, he was an abstentionist Member of Parliament (MP) of the British Parliament for the Belfast West constituency.\nIn 1984, Adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt by several gunmen from the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), including John Gregg. From the late 1980s onwards, he was an important figure in the Northern Ireland peace process, initially following contact by Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume and then subsequently with the Irish and British governments. He led Sinn F\u00e9in to change its traditional policy of abstentionism towards the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland, in 1986; it later took seats in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly. In 2005, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) stated that its armed campaign was over and that it was exclusively committed to peaceful politics.In 2014, Adams was held for four days by the Police Service of Northern Ireland for questioning in connection with the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in 1972. He was freed without charge and a file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service, which later stated there was insufficient evidence to charge him, as had been expected since shortly after his release. Adams announced in November 2017 that he would step down as leader of Sinn F\u00e9in in 2018, and that he would not stand for re-election to his seat in the D\u00e1il in the 2020 election.

The only IRA body that supported this viewpoint was the outgoing IRA Executive. Those members of the outgoing Executive who opposed the change comprised a quorum. They met, dismissed those in favour of the change, and set up a new Executive. They contacted Tom Maguire, who was a commander in the old IRA and had supported the Provisionals against the Official IRA (see Irish republican legitimatism), and asked him for support. Maguire had also been contacted by supporters of Gerry Adams, then president of Sinn F\u00e9in, and a supporter of the change in the Provisional IRA constitution.", " Similar to the claim put forward by the Provisional IRA after its split from the Official IRA in 1969, the Continuity IRA claims to be the legitimate continuation of the original Irish Republican Army or \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann. This argument is based on the view that the surviving anti-Treaty members of the Second D\u00e1il delegated their \"authority\" to the IRA Army Council in 1938. As further justification for this claim, Tom Maguire, one of those anti-Treaty members of the Second D\u00e1il, issued a statement in favour of the Continuity IRA, just as he had done in 1969 in favour of the Provisionals. J. Bowyer Bell, in his The Irish Troubles, describes Maguire's opinion in 1986: \"abstentionism was a basic tenet of republicanism, a moral issue of principle.

He saw the characteristics of the Obama administration and the Democratic majorities in Congress as representing the third and best great chance for universal health care, following the lost 1971 Nixon and 1993 Clinton opportunities, and as his last big legislative battle. Kennedy made another surprise appearance in the Senate to break a Republican filibuster against the Obama stimulus package. When spring arrived, Kennedy appeared on Capitol Hill more frequently, although staffers often did not announce his attendance at committee meetings until they were sure Kennedy was well enough to appear. On March 4, 2009, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown announced that Kennedy had been granted an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for his work in the Northern Ireland peace process, and for his contribution to UK\u2013US relations,As an American citizen, the British title would be purely honorary, and therefore Kennedy was not entitled to \"Sir\", though he is able to use the post-nominal Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) outside of the United States. See  although the move caused some controversy in the UK due to his connections with Gerry Adams of the Irish republican political party Sinn F\u00e9in. Later in March, a bill reauthorizing and expanding the AmeriCorps program was renamed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by Senator Hatch in Kennedy's honor. Kennedy threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park before the Boston Red Sox season opener in April, echoing what his grandfather \"Honey Fitz\"\u00a0\u2013 a member of the Royal Rooters\u00a0\u2013 had done to open the park in 1912. Even when his illness prevented him from being a major factor in health plan deliberations, his symbolic presence still made him one of the key senators involved."]}, {"page": "Anti-English sentiment", "response": ["In 2011, tensions and anti-English or anti-British feelings flared in relation to the proposed visit of Elizabeth II, the first British monarch to visit Ireland in 100 years. The direct invitation by the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, and the Irish government, was hailed by the Irish press as a historic visit, but was criticised by Sinn F\u00e9in President Gerry Adams. An anti-Queen demonstration was held at the GPO Dublin by a small group of Irish Republicans on 26 February 2011, and a mock trial and decapitation of an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II were carried out by socialist republican group \u00c9ir\u00edg\u00ed. Other protests included one Dublin publican (the father of Celtic player Anthony Stokes) hanging a banner declaring \"the Queen will never be welcome in this country\"."]}, {"page": "Resignation from the British House of Commons", "response": ["On 20 January 2011, Sinn F\u00e9in MP Gerry Adams submitted a letter of resignation to the Speaker, but did not apply for a Crown office, which would be politically unacceptable for a Sinn F\u00e9in politician. On 26 January, a Treasury spokesperson said \"Consistent with long-standing precedent, the Chancellor has taken [the letter] as a request to be appointed the Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead and granted the office.\" Although David Cameron said during Prime Minister's Questions that Adams had \"accepted an office for profit under the Crown\", Adams denied this, and continued to simply reject the title, albeit not its effect of removal from office."]}, {"page": "Manor of Northstead", "response": ["===Appointment of Gerry Adams===", "Sinn F\u00e9in MP Gerry Adams was appointed to the post after announcing his intention to resign from the UK Parliament to stand in the 2011 Irish general election. Adams denied that he had accepted the appointment, which would conflict with Sinn F\u00e9in's longstanding policy of refusing to pledge allegiance to the British Crown. It was later clarified in Parliament that Adams had not \"accepted\" the post, but had been appointed to it on announcing his desire to resign as an MP."]}, {"page": "John Bruton", "response": ["Bruton also established a working relationship with Gerry Adams of Sinn F\u00e9in, however both were mutually distrustful of each other. The relationship became frayed following the ending of the ceasefire in 1996, resulting in a bomb explosion in London. These relations worsened when the IRA killed Jerry McCabe, a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, in a botched post office robbery in County Limerick, and another bomb explosion in Manchester. However, Bruton received widespread praise in the Republic for condemning the Royal Ulster Constabulary for yielding to loyalist threats at Drumcree by allowing members of the Orange Order to parade through a nationalist district. He stated that the RUC had been neither impartial nor consistent in applying the law. His outrage and criticism led to a tense atmosphere between London and Dublin. By the time of the 1997 general election Sinn F\u00e9in stated that they would prefer a Fianna F\u00e1il led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 general election."]}]}}
