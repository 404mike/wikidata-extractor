He was an active trade unionist and member of the Labour Party.\nHe stood unsuccessfully in Blaydon for Labour in the 1918 general election, but was successful in the election four years later.  He went on to be the MP for Blaydon from 1922 to 1931. His defeat in the 1931 general election followed the events of that summer when Ramsay MacDonald quit the Labour Party to form a National Government and the election called in October that year reduced the Labour representation to a rump of 52 MPs.  However Whiteley was re-elected at the 1935 general election and went on to represent the constituency for the next twenty years until his death in 1955 at the age of 74.  In the consequent by-election, the seat was held for Labour by Robert Woof.\nPresident of the Durham Miners' Homes for the Aged 1927 \u2013 1955, Whiteley became a Privy Councillor after 1943 and was Labour Chief Whip in the House of Commons for thirteen years. During the government of Clement Attlee of 1945 \u2013 1951 was Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1936\u20131952)", "response": ["*William Whiteley (1882\u20131955)"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury", "response": ["*William Whiteley 1942\u20131951 (Labour, jointly until 1945)"]}, {"page": "Comptroller of the Household", "response": ["* 1940\u20131942: William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "Blaydon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1922 || William Whiteley || Labour", "|| 1935 || William Whiteley || Labour"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: W", "response": ["* William Whiteley (1922\u20131931), (1935\u20131955)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "Second MacDonald ministry", "response": ["| William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "Attlee ministry", "response": ["|Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury||William Whiteley||3 August 1945||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*William Whiteley, Blaydon, 1922\u201331; 35\u201355"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "William whiteley MP", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Whiteley (politician)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Whiteley"]}, {"page": "Robert Woof (politician)", "response": ["He was first elected to the House of Commons in a by-election in February 1956, following the death of the sitting MP, Labour's William Whiteley.
