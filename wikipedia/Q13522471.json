Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "response": ["According to Riley, the album \"drew people together through the common experience of pop on a larger scale than ever before\". In MacDonald's description, an \"almost religious awe surrounded the LP\"; he says that its impact was cross-generational, as \"Young and old alike were entranced\", and era-defining, in that the \"psychic shiver\" it inspired across the world was \"nothing less than a cinematic dissolve from one Zeitgeist to another\". In his view, Sgt. Pepper conveyed the psychedelic experience so effectively to listeners unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs that \"If such a thing as a cultural 'contact high' is possible, it happened here.\" Music journalist Mark Ellen, a teenager in 1967, recalls listening to part of the album at a friend's house and then hearing the rest playing at the next house he visited as if the record was emanating communally from \"one giant Dansette\". He says the most remarkable thing was its acceptance by adults who had turned against the Beatles when they became \"gaunt and enigmatic\", and how the group, recast as polished \"masters of ceremony\", were now \"the very family favourites they'd sought to satirise\"."]}, {"page": "Rubber Soul", "response": ["Author George Case, writing in his book Out of Our Heads, identifies Rubber Soul as \"the authentic beginning of the psychedelic era\". Music journalist Mark Ellen similarly credits the album with having \"sow[ed] the seeds of psychedelia\", while Christgau says that \"psychedelia starts here.\" Writing in The Sydney Morning Herald in July 1966, Lillian Roxon reported on the new trend for psychedelia-themed clubs and events in the US and said that Rubber Soul was \"the classic psychedelic album now played at all the psychedelic discotheques\". She attributed pop's recent embrace of psychedelia and \"many of the strange new sounds now in records\" to the LP's influence.

In Europe, the TV feed was supplied by the BBC, whose broadcast was presented by Richard Skinner, Andy Kershaw, Mark Ellen, David Hepworth, Andy Batten-Foster, Steve Blacknell, Paul Gambaccini, Janice Long and Mike Smith and included numerous interviews and chats in between the various acts. The BBC's television sound feed was mono, as was all UK TV audio before NICAM was introduced, but the BBC Radio 1 feed was stereo and was simulcast in sync with the TV pictures. Unfortunately, in the rush to set up the transatlantic feeds, the sound feed from Philadelphia was sent to London via transatlantic cable, while the video feed was via satellite, which meant a lack of synchronisation on British television receivers. Due to the constant activities in both London and Philadelphia, the BBC producers omitted the reunion of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young from their broadcast. The BBC, however, did supply a 'clean feed' to various television channels in Europe."]}, {"page": "The Old Grey Whistle Test", "response": ["Following the departure of Nightingale in 1982, Mark Ellen, David Hepworth and Richard Skinner also took turns as presenters.

Citing a quantitative study of tempos in music from the era, Everett identifies it as a work that was \"made more to be thought about than danced to\", and an album that \"began a far-reaching trend\" in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music. Many baroque-rock works appeared soon afterwards, particularly due to Martin's harpsichord-like solo on the track \"In My Life\", while the album also marked the introduction into pop of the pump organ or harmonium. Revolver ensured that psychedelic pop emerged from its underground roots and into the mainstream, while \"Rain\" originated British psychedelic rock. The chamber-orchestrated \"Eleanor Rigby\" is cited by Simonelli as an example of the Beatles' influence being such that, whatever the style of song, it helped to define the parameters of rock music."]}, {"page": "Ugly Rumours (band)", "response": ["Ugly Rumours was the name of a rock band founded in part by future UK prime minister Tony Blair, while studying law at St John's College, Oxford during the early 1970s; he sang and played guitar.

Around December, Vaughn painted a psychedelic design on a piano owned by Paul McCartney. When delivering the piano to McCartney's home in St John's Wood, he asked McCartney to contribute a musical piece for The Million Volt Light and Sound Rave. To Vaughan's surprise, McCartney agreed. This is the story offered in Barry Miles' 1997 biography Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now.

Mordoh of Rockdelux, Swoon is \"a collection of breathless verses and crisp rhythms, with lively acoustic guitar strummed funk \u2013 a fluid combination \u2013 and bossa nova beats draped in symphonic keyboards\". Creem Magazines Karen Schoemer similarly observed how the album's \"jumpy playful melodies are fenced in by acoustic guitars and light piano arrangements\". while Mark Ellen of Smash Hits described \"twisting rhythms and strange wistful chords for scenery\". Paul Lester of The Guardian has summarised the album sound as \"the lush sweep of George Gershwin and complex musicality of Stephen Sondheim, only played with the awkward angularity of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band\". Sondheim, admired by McAloon for his precise emotional and melodic content, was an influence on the album. McAloon considered him one of the \"real greats\", along with Burt Bacharach and Paul McCartney, and favoured artists who can successfully combine being adventurous with being commercial. Other formative influences include Igor Stravinsky, David Bowie, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Steely Dan and Television. Sam Sodomsky of Pitchfork made note of the album's \"post-punk edge\" \u2013 which would be abandoned in the band's subsequent work \u2013 and highlighted McAloon balancing themes of heartbreak and adulthood with \"questions that most songwriters might find trivial,\" while noting Smith's \"wordless refrains and non-sequitur exclamations that took pleasure in twisting expectations.\"", "Swoon earned critical acclaim upon release. Melody Maker's Ian Pye commended the \"magnificent\" album's production despite its humble budget, and felt the songs had a \"remarkable continuity\" despite being written over a period of years.

Smith of Record Mirror described Swoon as \"lightly magni\ufb01cent, a touch glorious, a little bit heavenly\" and \"the best record since Imperial Bedroom,\" while Joe Breen of The Irish Times called it \"one of the most arresting and interesting sets released this year\" and highlighted the \"emotional strength\" of \"Cruel\" and \"I Couldn\u2019t Bear To Be Special\". Jan-Olov Andersson of Sweden's Aftonbladet declared Swoon \"without a doubt one of the best debut albums in recent years; a record full of intelligent, sophisticated pop music with elegant arrangements and artful lyrics\". Writing in Debut Magazine, Kathryn Nichols commented \"a Prefab song does take quite a few listenings with its unorthodox arrangements and chord changes, but it\u2019s fresh, interesting and certainly worth persevering with\" Dave McCullough of Sounds felt the album sounded indie and \"would have been better with a big production and a big sound\".
