A self-taught artist, undoubtedly influenced by his job as an antiques dealer, he worked up his forgeries from sketches, photographs, art books and catalogues. He attempted a wide range of crafts, from painting in pastels and watercolours, to sketches, and sculpture, both modern and ancient, busts and statues, to bas-relief and metalwork. He invested in a vast range of different materials - silver, stone, marble, rare stone, replica metal, and glass. He also did meticulous research to authenticate his items with histories and provenance (for instance, faking letters from the supposed artists) in order to demonstrate his ownership. Completed items were then stored about the house and garden shed. The latter probably served as a workshop as well.", "Yet for all his daring \u2013 he once boasted that he could knock up a Moran watercolour in half an hour and claimed to have completed an Amarna statue in three weeks \u2013 Shaun Greenhalgh needed the help of his parents. At the trial it was said by the lawyer, Brian McKenna, that Greenhalgh's mother, Olive (1925-2016), made the telephone calls \"because he was shy and did not like to use the telephone.\"", "Another piece sold to an unnamed private buyer came to light when the Art Institute of Chicago announced that The Faun, a ceramic sculpture on display since 1997 as the work of the 19th-century French master Paul Gauguin, was also a forgery by Shaun Greenhalgh.

What is known is that \"two Halifax accounts... one containing \u00a355,173 and the other \u00a3303,646\" were frozen, pending a confiscation hearing in January 2008, and Shaun Greenhalgh was convicted for \"conspiracy to conceal and transfer \u00a3410,392.\" Estimates of the amount of money the Greenhalghs actually made vary from \u00a3850,000 to \u00a31.5 million.", "As they did not display wealth, explanations other than desire for money have been proposed. Police suggested that Shaun Greenhalgh was motivated less by profit than by resentment at his own lack of recognition as an artist. This \"general hatred\" became a need to \"shame the art world\" and \"show them up\", but this was denied by Greenhalgh in his autobiography, A Forger's Tale. The defence lawyer Andrew Nutall characterized Shaun Greenhalgh as a shy, introverted person, obsessed with \"one outlook and that was his garden shed\". The forgeries were an attempt to \"perfect the love he had for such arts\". By implication, the forgeries were a mere unintended, if unfortunate, consequence.", "44 forgeries were discussed during the trial, and 120 were known to have been presented to various institutions. However, given the family's bank records only extended back for a third of the period they were operating, and Shaun Greenhalgh's high level of productivity, there are probably many more.
