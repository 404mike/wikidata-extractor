She was internationally renowned for her influence in promoting the importance of good literature for children. This came about through her books, world lecture tours and her own notable journal Growing Point. Her papers for the period 1937\u20131992 are held in the Department of Special Collections at the University of California. She was a recipient of the Eleanor Farjeon Award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Enid Blyton", "response": ["From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC operated a de facto ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering her to be a \"second-rater\" whose work was without literary merit. The children's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton's books to \"slow poison\", and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out \"mediocre material\", noting that \"her capacity to do so amounts to genius\u00a0... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago\". Michael Rosen, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that \"I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books.\" The children's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the \"drip, drip, drip of disapproval\" associated with the books. Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, stating that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from \"stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books\"."]}, {"page": "The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003\u00bd", "response": ["Children's fiction critic Margery Fisher was more critical: \"003 1/2 seems to be satire on three levels. First, with its bullion robbers and the indomitable amateur boy who cracks the code, as it were, the book sends up the junior thriller; young Bond with his blacked and infra-red camera and judo principles (\"Don't go against the enemy, go with him\") is a remote cousin of Miss Blyton's water-pistol-carrying kids. Then (and I am less certain of the author's intention here) the fast-moving events and casual cruelty of the story may be a satire on the exploits of Jimmy's notorious uncle; if so, it is a satire many readers won't see or won't want to. Mascott has given us glimpses of the sordid and a nearer approach to danger (and one brilliant female character drawn in the round). But one swallow doesn't make a summer and all Sheelagh's gibes and kisses and dirty clothes don't make this a genuinely realistic book.\"."]}, {"page": "The Book of Three", "response": ["In 2012 The Book of Three was ranked number 18 among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. Ruth Hill Viguers of The Horn Book Magazine said the book would \"wear well, and that children will be eager for other stories in which Taran may yet learn the meaning of heroism. The Junior Bookshelf criticized the supporting characters, the contrived and excessive use of humor, and the heavy-use of lessons. Margery Fisher in Growing Point, criticized the novel for being too derivative of Tolkien, Garner, Masefield, and T.H. White  and that, \"perhaps with only one of these models or influences, it would be better\". The Times Literary Supplement called the novel \"a very fine fantasy-adventure\", admitting that the book does not compare to the works of Tolkien, but has \"quite a compelling magic of its own\". The School Library Journal called the novel, \"one of the most iconic and influential works of middle-grade fiction from the 20th century,\" which \"helped pave the way for countless fantasy adventures.\""]}, {"page": "Lois Duncan", "response": ["In 1978, Duncan published the controversial Killing Mr. Griffin, a novel that details three high-school students' murder of their  English teacher. Critic Margery Fisher noted Duncan's \"unreserved\" approach to writing the novel, in language she described as both \"harsh and literal.\" Richard Peck of The New York Times also praised the novel, writing: \"Duncan breaks some new ground in a novel without sex, drugs, or black leather jackets, but the taboo she tampers with is far more potent and pervasive: the unleashed fury of the permissively reared against any assault on their egos and authority ... The value of the book lies in the twisted logic of the teenagers and how easily they can justify anything.\" Killing Mr. Griffin was one of Duncan's major critical successes, and was selected as an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults that year."]}, {"page": "Charlotte Sometimes (novel)", "response": ["While writing Emma in Winter, Farmer was unaware that identity was such a dominant theme in the book. She only realised that when she read Margery Fisher's comments on the book in Growing Point. She had a similar realisation, this time on her own, while writing Charlotte Sometimes. She writes that \"halfway through Charlotte Sometimes I realized that I was writing a book about identity. I am a twin, a non-identical one, and apparently one of the chief problems of non-identical twins is always the establishment of a genuine and separate sense of identity. Looking back I can see this has in fact been an obsession with me, since the age of twelve or so at least.\"", "Margery Fisher, in a 1969 review for her children's literature journal Growing Point, wrote, \"Like Emma in Winter, this is really a study in disintegration, the study of a girl finding an identity by losing it.... Above all, here is a dream-allegory which teaches not through statement but through feeling. We sense the meaning of Charlotte's changes of identity in the way that she senses them herself.... [It is] a book of quite exceptional distinction... a haunting, convincing story which comes close to being a masterpiece of its kind....\"Margery Fisher, review of Charlotte Sometimes, Growing Point, November 1969, p. 1408, cited in Something About the Author 105 (1999) p. 68."]}, {"page": "MARGERY FISHER (children's literature expert) 1913 - 1992", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margery Fisher"]}, {"page": "Penelope Farmer", "response": ["Farmer stated that she, while writing Emma in Winter, did not realize that identity was such a predominant theme in the novel until she encountered Margery Fisher's comments on the book.
