He made nearly 450 appearances in the English and Scottish Football Leagues, representing ten different clubs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Allinson", "response": ["Allinson played a crucial role in Colchester's promotion winning side of the 1976\u201377 season, netting the winning goal in the final game of the season against Bradford City that secured a promotion slot. A consistent performer with the U's, it was not until the 1981\u201382 season that Allinson began to be noticed by the wider football world. Colchester boasted a powerful strike force of Roy McDonough, Kevin Bremner, Tony Adcock and Allinson, who scored 43 league goals in just two seasons. Allinson was valued in the region of \u00a3100,000 to Colchester, but an administration error cost the club dearly when his future benefits and bonuses were erroneously entered as less than his previous contract, entitling the player to a free-transfer. Fulham were the club most likely to sign Allinson, before a late bid from Arsenal was placed, joining them in the summer of 1983."]}, {"page": "Tony Adcock", "response": ["Adcock became a prolific scorer for Colchester, and established himself in the first-team squad following the death of John Lyons and the departure of Kevin Bremner. In the 1984\u201385 season, having scored 17 goals and 26 goals in the previous two seasons respectively, Adcock was on course to break the club's seasonal and overall scoring records, having scored 24 league goals in just 27 games up until January 1985. However, after scoring a hat-trick against Chesterfield, he suffered a knee injury in training that kept him out for the remainder of the season. This was particularly unfortunate for Adcock as it had been rumoured that Liverpool were on the verge of making an offer for him. On his return from injury, he remained with the club for two further seasons, scoring 15 and 11 goals as he played his last game for the club on 17 May 1987, a play-off second leg against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, a game which the U's drew 0\u20130 but lost 2\u20130 on aggregate following a first-leg home defeat. Until this point, Adcock had scored 98 league goals in 210 outings."]}]}}
