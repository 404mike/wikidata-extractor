He entered St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1970 and received his Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge in 1977 under his advisor, D. J. H. Garling. Since 1979 Aldous has been on the faculty at University of California, Berkeley.\nHe was awarded the Rollo Davidson Prize in 1980, the Lo\u00e8ve Prize in 1993, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1994. In 2004, Aldous was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. From 2004 to 2010, Aldous was an Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1998 in Berlin and a plenary speaker at the ICM in 2010 in Hyderabad. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He discovered (independently from Andrei Broder) an algorithm for generating a uniform spanning tree of a given graph.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of mathematical probabilists", "response": ["*David Aldous (born 1952)"]}, {"page": "Andrei Broder", "response": ["In 1989, he discovered (independently from David Aldous) an algorithm for generating a uniform spanning tree of a given graph."]}, {"page": "Lo\u00e8ve Prize", "response": ["* 1993 \u2013 David Aldous"]}, {"page": "Aldous", "response": ["*David Aldous (actor)", "*David Aldous, mathematician", "*David Aldous, stock car driver; see List of 2008 motorsport champions"]}, {"page": "The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable", "response": ["Mathematics professor David Aldous argued that \"Taleb is sensible (going on prescient) in his discussion of financial markets and in some of his general philosophical thought, but tends toward irrelevance or ridiculous exaggeration otherwise.\" Gregg Easterbrook wrote a critical review of The Black Swan in the New York Times to which Taleb replied with a list of logical errors, blaming Easterbrook for not having read the book. Giles Foden, writing for The Guardian in 2007, described the book as insightful, but facetiously written, saying that Taleb's \"dumbed-down\" style was a central problem, especially in comparison to his earlier book, Fooled by Randomness.
