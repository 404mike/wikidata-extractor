After drawing 1\u20131 at Hillsborough, York were defeated 2\u20130 in the replay at Roker Park, which ended an FA Cup campaign in which Arthur Bottom scored eight goals. The team were billed \"The Happy Wanderers\" after a popular song; Henry Rose of the Daily Express said, \"There are no weak spots in this First Division side masquerading in Third Division shirts\". By the end of the cup run, York were on the fringes of the Third Division North promotion race, but injuries and a congested fixture list led to them finishing fourth in 1954\u201355.
