Inspired by art, nature and technology he refers to his fantastical sculptural pieces as functional art. Developing new forms to accompany new ways of living, he has approached audio product design as an art in and of itself. His aesthetic is not only about the combination of performance and design but the space an object can create when not in use.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blue Room Released", "response": ["Blue Room Released was an electronic music record label from London, England.
