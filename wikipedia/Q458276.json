Blackburn, however, would only score three points more all season and were relegated to the Championship after finishing in 19th position. In contrast to the two previous seasons where Robinson had averaged ten league clean sheets a season, he kept just three clean sheets in the league, having played 34 matches. All three clean sheets came from matches where Blackburn won 2\u20130.

With new ownership, Derby had been able to compete in the transfer market for the first time in a number of years, with Luton Town's Steve Howard becoming the club's first \u00a31 million signing since Fran\u00e7ois Grenet six years previously and, alongside captures from Premiership clubs such as West Ham United's Stephen Bywater and Fulham's Dean Leacock, manager Billy Davies began shaping a side capable of competing at the right end of the table. This wasn't apparent from the off, however, and a return of just five points from the club's opening six fixtures did not hint at instant success for Davies, leaving influential and creative players such as Tommy Smith and I\u00f1igo Idiakez to depart the club prior to the closing of the August transfer window. However, a 1\u20130 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 12 September proved a catalyst as the club lost only four of its next 27 fixtures (a run which included winning all six league fixtures in November and an eight-match winning streak of six league and two FA Cup games from 30 December to 10 February). After a 2\u20132 draw at home to Hull City on 10 February, Derby were six points clear at the top of the table and had strengthened for the promotion run-in with the signing of Tyrone Mears, Jay McEveley, Gary Teale, David Jones, Craig Fagan, Stephen Pearson and Jon Macken for a combined \u00a35 million. However, a 2\u20130 defeat away to Plymouth Argyle in the fifth round preceded a notable wobble in results and the club recorded a return of just six points from the next five games, conceding top spot to Birmingham City after a 1\u20130 defeat at St. Andrews on 9 March. A resounding 5\u20131 win against Colchester United (by far the biggest win of a campaign which saw victory by a two-goal margin or greater on just six occasions) looked to have put the club back on track, but, after taking just 12 points from the next ten fixtures, the club slipped out of the automatic promotion places altogether and a 2\u20130 defeat at Crystal Palace in the penultimate game of the season confirmed a 3rd-placed finish and entry into the 2006\u201307 Championship playoffs."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Wigan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| David Jones", "|6||||MF||David Jones||1||0||0||0||1||0||2||0"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|David Jones"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|David Jones"]}, {"page": "David Jones (footballer born 1984)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Jones (footballer, born 1984)"]}]}}
