Moor made various other speculations on the connection between Janus and Ganesha.The summary of Moor's case is taken from Nagar, op. cit., p. 99, note 3.  These fanciful connections proposed by early Indologists no longer appear in modern academic reviews of Ganesha's history.Janus is not listed in the indexes for Brown (1991), Courtright (1985), or Thapan (1997), three of the most-often cited current academic reviews on Ganesha."]}, {"page": "The Hindu Pantheon", "response": ["The Hindu Pantheon was a book written by Edward Moor, an early European scholar of Indian religion.

In the 1820s, with the help of his son the Reverend Edward James Moor, he built a low pyramid southeast of Bealings House, about ten feet (three metres) high, of mixed found materials (including mill-wheels) but incorporating at the apex the triple-headed figure of Shiva and in a niche the seated figure of Brahma. These were found by Moor on Malabar Point, Bombay, and appear to be 11th century.
