He is best known for playing the accordion with Silly Wizard, as well as in other bands and in duets with his brother, Johnny. When they played together, Johnny and Phil would often horse around as only brothers can, egging each other on to play faster and faster, and trying, light-heartedly, to trip each other up.Phil has also collaborated with numerous other great Celtic musicians; one prominent example of this is his partnership with Aly Bain. The duo have (as of 2020) released nine albums, and between 1989 and 2019 they had a yearly spot at the New Year's Hogmanay Live broadcast on BBC Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1960 in music", "response": ["**Phil Cunningham, folk musician"]}, {"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*Phil Cunningham"]}, {"page": "List of Celtic musicians", "response": ["*Phil Cunningham"]}, {"page": "Music of Scotland", "response": ["Most recently, Scottish piping has included a renaissance for cauldwind pipes such as smallpipes and border pipes, which use cold, dry air as opposed to the moist air of mouth-blown pipes.

The accordion also gained in popularity during the 1970s due to the renown of Phil Cunningham, whose distinctive piano accordion style was an integral part of the band Silly Wizard. Numerous musicians continued to follow more traditional styles including Alex Beaton.", "Though often derided as Scottish kitsch, the accordion has long been a part of Scottish music. Country dance bands, such as that led by the renowned Jimmy Shand, have helped to dispel this image.  In the early 20th century, the melodeon (a variety of diatonic button accordion) was popular among rural folk, and was part of the bothy band tradition.  More recently, performers like Phil Cunningham (of Silly Wizard) and Sandy Brechin have helped popularise the accordion in Scottish music."]}, {"page": "Michael McGoldrick", "response": ["*Five And Twenty - Aly Bain & Phil Cunningham (2012)"]}, {"page": "Txalaparta", "response": ["*  (\"Balance Tx(alaparta)\"): Igor Otxoa and Harkaitz Martinez de San Vicente team up late in the 90s out of other couples and join the Kepa Junkera band in his concerts and album releases, mostly playing along with  accordions and other folk instruments of the ensemble.
