Collard, piloting the No. 16 Pescarolo, was the fastest driver in the petrol-powered LMP1 entries, in eighth. Dumas exited Mulsanne corner at speed and collided side-on with the right-hand corner in the door area of Roald Goethe's stopped No. 60 Aston Martin, which had spun earlier. Both drivers were unhurt, and qualifying was stopped for five minutes.
