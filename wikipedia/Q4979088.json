Some small changes were made, including the addition of electric lights, which were designed to flicker like candles, the replacement of the original ropes that moved the machinery, and the substitution of replicas for delicate backdrops. Most of the theatre, however, was unchanged from the original design, and much of the stucco work and original wallpaper remains today. The theatre re-opened on 19 August 1922. Until 1935, performances were limited to occasional showcases for visiting scholars, usually including dances performed by the Swedish Ballet School. In 1935, the theatre began to host seasonal performances, starting with three ballad operas by H\u00f6pken, Kraus and Bellman. In 1951, the Royal Swedish Opera became the permanent company performing in Drottningholm Theatre, using the space for their summer performances. In 1953, the Royal Swedish Ballet joined in partnership with the Opera, and the company\u2019s new director, Mary Skeaping, pushed the dancers to revive the 17th and 18th century court ballet style. In August 1998, a Gluck programme was staged, including Paris and Helen with Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1 singing Paris, Alceste in the Italian version and the ballet Don Juan. The first new opera to be premiered at the theatre in modern times was Jonas Forssell's Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden (The Garden) in July 1999, conducted by Roy Goodman, with Malena Ernman in the trouser role of Zi\u00f6berg.Allison, John.
