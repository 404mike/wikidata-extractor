The three were suspected by the British authorities of being part of a plot to detonate a car bomb in the car park while it was full of soldiers preparing for the ceremony; while the suspects were walking back towards the Spanish border, they were shot dead by British soldiers, members of the Special Air Service. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, the British government released a statement to the effect that a large car bomb had been found in Gibraltar, and that three suspected terrorists had been shot dead by the Gibraltar Police.Eckert, p. 88. That evening, British television news reported the finding of the alleged car bomb, and added that the IRA members had been involved in a \"shootout\" with authorities. All of Britain's daily newspapers covered the shootings the following morning, several of which cited the size of the alleged car bomb as  and claimed that it was \"packed with shrapnel\". The same morning, Ian Stewart, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, told BBC Radio 4 that \"military personnel were involved\" in the shootings, and that \"a car bomb was found, which has been defused\".Eckert, pp. 86\u201387."]}, {"page": "Operation Flavius", "response": ["Operation Flavius was a military operation in which three members of a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) cell were shot dead by undercover members of the British Special Air Service (SAS) in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988. The three \u2014Se\u00e1n Savage, Daniel McCann, and Mair\u00e9ad Farrell who were members of Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade \u2014 were believed to be mounting a car bomb attack on British military personnel in Gibraltar. Plain-clothed SAS soldiers approached them in the forecourt of a petrol station, then opened fire, killing them. All three were found to be unarmed, and no bomb was discovered in Savage's car, leading to accusations that the British government had conspired to murder them. An inquest in Gibraltar ruled that the SAS had acted lawfully, while the European Court of Human Rights held that, although there had been no conspiracy, the planning and control of the operation was so flawed as to make the use of lethal force almost inevitable. The deaths were the first in a chain of violent events in a fourteen-day period. On 16 March, the funeral of the three IRA members was attacked by a loyalist wielding pistols and grenades, leaving three mourners dead. Then, at the funeral of one of the mourners, the IRA shot two plain clothed British soldiers who had driven into the procession in error.", "The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) aimed to establish a united Ireland and end the British administration of Northern Ireland through the use of force. The organisation was the result of a 1969 split in the Irish Republican Army;Bishop & Mallie, pp. 136\u2013138. the other group, the Marxist-Lenininist Official IRA, ceased military activity in the 1970s. The IRA killed civilians, members of the armed forces, police, judiciary and prison service, including off-duty and retired members, and bombed businesses and military targets in both Northern Ireland and England, with the aim of making Northern Ireland ungovernable.Coogan, pp. 375\u2013376, 379.O'Leary, pp. 210\u2013211. Daniel McCann, Se\u00e1n Savage, and Mair\u00e9ad Farrell were, according to journalist Brendan O'Brien, \"three of the IRA's most senior activists\". Savage was an explosives expert and McCann was \"a high-ranking intelligence operative\"; both McCann and Farrell had previously served prison sentences for offences relating to explosives.O'Brien, p. 151.Crawshaw & Holmstr\u00f6m, p. 88.English, p. 257.", "In the weeks after the resumption of the changing of the guard ceremony, the three IRA members who were to carry out the attack\u2014Se\u00e1n Savage, Daniel McCann, and Mair\u00e9ad Farrell\u2014travelled to M\u00e1laga ( along the coast from Gibraltar), where they each rented a car.Eckert, p. 63. Their activities were monitored and by early March, the British authorities were convinced that an IRA attack was imminent; a special projects team from the SAS was despatched to the territory, apparently with the personal approval of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Eckert, pp. 67\u201368. Before the operation, the SAS practised arrest techniques, while the Gibraltar authorities searched for a suitable place to hold the would-be bombers after their arrest.Punch, p. 15. The plan was that the SAS would assist the Gibraltar Police in arresting the IRA members\u2014identified by MI5 officers who had been in Gibraltar for several weeks\u2014if they were seen parking a car in Gibraltar and then attempting to leave the territory.Eckert, p. 70."]}]}}
