He developed and contributed to many dinghy classes that are still with us nearly a century later: the Albacore, International 14, National 12, Jet 14, Firefly and Flying Fifteen.  The Scorpion was designed in 1959 by Taprell Dorling.", "In 1928 Uffa Fox introduced planing to the English dinghy racing world in his International 14 boat, the Avenger. He gained 52 first places, two second places and three third places out of 57 race starts that year. Note: Graham Anderson in his 1999 book Fast Light Boats, a Century of Kiwi Innovation argues that planing centreboard sailing boats were introduced into New Zealand in the early 20th century \u2013 well before Uffa Fox popularised the concept.", "Uffa Fox started building 14s in 1923, and was designing them by 1925. He was to transform the class with the introduction of his first planing hull design, Avenger, in 1927. The construction and finish of his 14s was considered by many to be the ultimate in quality and craftsmanship, and Thunder and Lightning built in 1938 was no exception.", "At the beginning of the 21st century, dinghy sailing is still a rapidly developing sport. It is losing its image of being expensive, time consuming, and exclusive. This is because of the earlier work of pioneers such as Uffa Fox, and through the use of modern designs and techniques such as lighter hull materials (e.g., fibreglass and foam sandwich hull construction, which eliminate time-consuming maintenance and constant care that wooden hulls required, although they are rare and only a few people make them some still sail with wooden boats), more responsive sail materials and design, easily transportable boats (many car-toppable), and simpler rigs such as gennakers instead of more complex spinnakers. These advances are more economical in time and money, and have greatly extended the appeal of dinghy sailing.", "Racing dinghies are designed for racing,  but not all have necessarily the same calibre of performance as the above.  However, in many cases they can still offer equally close competition,  at the very highest standards,  which for many racing helmsmen and crews is the most important consideration.  They cover a wide range, and many are descended from Uffa Fox's seminal International 14. People often \"travel\" with their dinghies to international races in famous sailing spots such as Lake Garda in Italy.  The Snipe International Class still stands as one of the strongest classes, after reaching the status of world's largest fleet of dinghies in July 1936.  Other examples include the GP14, Enterprise, Scorpion, Solo, Graduate, Firefly, Lark.  A specialized subgroup is the Scow, which typically uses two bilgeboards instead of a centerboard, and may have two rudders. Many racing dinghies require two or more people to sail the boat, the skipper is in charge or steering and the main sail depending on the boat, and the crew is in charge of the jib, the spinnaker,(which can only be flown while going downwind) and keeping the boat level"]}, {"page": "Cowes", "response": ["* Uffa Fox \u2014 naval architect, author, yachtsman"]}, {"page": "Albacore (dinghy)", "response": ["The Albacore is a 4.57\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) two-person planing dinghy, for competitive racing and lake and near-inshore day sailing.

Recent boats retain the same classic dimensions, and use modern materials and modern control systems, making it ideal for the recently graduated college racer, as well as those with less experience.", "The first Albacore (number 1) was built by Clive Dollery and Dave Lowe, who adapted Uffa Fox's design. They were both junior members of the Locks Sailing club in Portsmouth, England (UK) in the 1950s. They crewed in a variety of boats including Lowe's National 12, but they were also keen amateur boat builders.", "Dollery wanted a boat to race. They wanted to start with a ready made hull.
