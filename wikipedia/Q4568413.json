His first Youth ODI followed a month later, against India. Since 2003, Wagg has played Twenty20 cricket, including a Twenty20 Cup final against Surrey.\nWagg spent calendar year 2005 out of the game following allegations of his use of cocaine, and was released by Warwickshire, signing for Derbyshire for 2006 on a one-year contract. His comeback season was solid and he played in just over half of the county's Championship games. He was much better in 2007 taking 50 wickets for the first time and scoring four 50s. Consequently, he earnt a new two-year contract at the club. His all-round progress continued in 2008 when he took 59 first-class wickets and scored a century and two fifties. After a limited 2010 season, he moved to Glamorgan.\nOn 14 October 2020, it was announced that Wagg would leave Glamorgan after ten seasons with the Cardiff-based club. He was recruited to Glamorgan by coach Matthew Maynard in 2011 and was a regular selection for the vast majority of his decade at the club, having a testimonial in 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 28", "response": ["*  1983   \u2013 Graham Wagg, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Paul Nixon", "response": ["In the next game, Nixon then went on to record his highest ever Twenty20 score against Derbyshire.
