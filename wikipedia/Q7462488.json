We have still been unable to get our aid workers to the south where they are desperately needed.  We have to think extremely carefully about where we go and in what vehicles, because the Israelis are attacking vehicles over a certain length. It means that only 20 tonnes at a time is getting moved. On the Syrian border the World Food Programme is being forced to unload trucks of aid into smaller vehicles for safety.\""]}, {"page": "Dan Hicks (archaeologist)", "response": ["Hicks has appeared regularly on television and radio, including BBC Radio 4's In Our Time  and Making History.
