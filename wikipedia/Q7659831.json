He played at both half-back and left-wing during his football career and many trophies for middle-distance running.\nBeaumont was born in Wrestlingworth, Bedfordshire, and began his career with Colchester Town. He moved on to Lincoln City, making his league debut in the 1904\u201305 season. However, he made just five league appearances for the Imps before joining Bedfordshire side Biggleswade & District.\nHe joined Watford in 1909, playing in the Southern League. He played 25 times for Watford before joining Preston North End in 1911,\n\nbut made just one league appearance before joining Merthyr Town in the 1912 close season. He also played for Merthy Town Cricket Club.\n\nHe spent just one season with Merthyr, making fifteen appearances, before joining Troedyrhiw in the summer of 1913. He later finished his playing career with Llanelli.\n\nAfter steering Barry Town to their first ever league championship in 1921, the summer of 1923 saw Beaumont appointed as manager of Third Division South side Aberdare Athletic. Aberdare finished 9th in the 1925/26 season, but a combination of circumstances, including industrial action amongst the local mining community which affected attendances and the burning down of a wooden grandstand, meant that Aberdare's poor financial situation deteriorated. At the end of the 1926/27, Aberdare failed to gain re-election to the league and were replaced by Torquay United.\nBeaumont left that summer, but was soon appointed as manager of Blackpool, another club with severe financial problems at that time. He took over from Frank Buckley and immediately began to dismantle the team and bring in big-money names. His outlook was different from that of his predecessor, and his overhaul of tactics resulted in problems. The team struggled, losing five of their first six league games (a draw at Swansea on the opening day being the exception to the rule). One tactic that did work, however, was his moving Billy Tremelling from centre-forward back to half-back, which resulted in a fruitful partnership with Jimmy Hampson (a player Beaumont had brought to the seaside).\nBeing a former Preston North End player hardly endeared Beaumont to the Blackpool faithful. As the Seasiders struggled in Division Two, criticism of Beaumont grew. Eventually, in May 1928, with the team in the bottom three, he resigned \u2014 at the time becoming the club's shortest-serving manager with 42 League games to his name.Two months later, he took over as secretary-manager of Bangor City.\nHe served as assistant trainer for Chester AFC during 1936-37\nBeaumont died in 1939 at the age of 54 or 55 leaving his widow Elizabeth Beaumont and children, Elsie, Sylvia, Robert, Betty and Joan. His son Robert was a footballer and cricketer.", "link_mentions": {}}}
