She began to sing opera, first with Sadler's Wells Opera, and joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1972.  There she moved up from chorister to small-role player, understudying larger roles, taking on the major mezzo-soprano role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore in 1975. In 1977, she took over as the company's principal contralto, playing ten of these leading roles with the company until its closure in 1982.  She married Michael Buchan (n\u00e9 Michael Fox), who joined D'Oyly Carte with her and performed frequently with her in later years.\nIn later years, she continued to perform in Gilbert and Sullivan operas with various opera companies and with the group Gilbert and Sullivan for All. She also returned to singing in concerts, including oratorios, opera pieces and other classical works, including in a series of The Proms evenings with the National Concert Orchestra, as well as operetta, musical theatre and music hall. She appeared on BBC broadcasts and in plays, films and commercials until about 2008 and gave singing lessons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Edith||Joan Gillingham||Joyce Wright||Peggy Ann Jones||Patricia Leonard||Jill Pert", "|Ruth||Ella Halman||Ann Drummond-Grant||Christene Palmer||Lyndsie Holland||Patricia Leonard"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Peep-Bo||Beryl Dixon||Pauline Wales||Patricia Leonard||Roberta Morrell", "|Katisha||Ann Drummond-Grant||Christene Palmer||Lyndsie Holland||Patricia Leonard"]}, {"page": "Iolanthe", "response": ["|Fairy Queen||Ann Drummond-Grant||Christene Palmer||Lyndsie Holland||Patricia Leonard", "|Leila||Beryl Dixon||Pauline Wales||Patricia Leonard||Helene Witcombe"]}, {"page": "Ruddigore", "response": ["|Dame Hannah||Ella Halman||Ann Drummond-Grant||Christene Palmer||Lyndsie Holland||Patricia Leonard"]}, {"page": "H.M.S.
