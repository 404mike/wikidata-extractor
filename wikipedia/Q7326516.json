The referee instructed the captains to wear armbands, but Guisborough did not have such a thing in their kit. According to the club's secretary, there was no such requirement under FA Cup rules. After Hankin used and then discarded a wristband because it was too tight, the referee booked him for not wearing his armband, and then sent him off for using \"foul and abusive language\" when he argued. The matter was raised in Parliament by the local MP, Richard Holt, who took advantage of parliamentary privilege to assert that the team were \"cheated by a biased referee\" who should have been \"hounded out of the ground.\""]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Richard Holt"]}, {"page": "Richard Holt", "response": ["Richard Holt may refer to:", "*Richard Holt (MP for Langbaurgh) (1931\u20131991), British Conservative Member of Parliament", "*Richard Holt (cricketer) (1920\u20132001), English cricketer", "*Richard Holt (died 1710), MP for Lymington, and for Petersfield "]}, {"page": "1991 in England", "response": ["** Richard Holt, Conservative MP for Langbaurgh in Cleveland, dies suddenly at the age of 60."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Richard Holt (in office)"]}]}}
