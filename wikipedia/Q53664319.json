Trained as a nurse in London, she began a career as a historian after noticing no history about Ayrshire whitework embroidery in books following an exhibition at the Signet Library which she visited. Swain's research on the subject resulted in the publication of several books, she held two exhibitions, and wrote about embroidery, household textiles and tapestries in museum journals, magazines and newspapers. She was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1981. A pencil portrait of Swain was made by Elizabeth Blackadder and a collection of papers and objects related to her career are stored at National Museums Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret", "response": ["* Margaret Swain (1909\u20132002), English embroidery and textile historian"]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Margaret Swain || Charlotte Mitchell || 1982"]}, {"page": "Swain (surname)", "response": ["* Margaret Swain (1909\u20132002), English embroidery and textile historian"]}, {"page": "Oxburgh Hangings", "response": ["* Needlework of Mary Queen of Scots, by Margaret Swain, published in 1973, "]}, {"page": "Sewed muslin", "response": ["A notable developer of the industry in Scotland was Mrs Jamieson, the wife of an Ayrshire cotton agent. Seeing a philanthropic opportunity, she set out to teach local farmers' wives and daughters the trade, focusing on firm satin stitch, overcast fillings, and fine lace stitches in cut-out spaces. The designs were drawn up by professional draughtsmen in Glasgow before being sent out to be embroidered by outworkers. They were then bleached, made up, boxed and widely marketed, proving especially popular in North America.Margaret Swain, Ayrshire and Other Whitework (Shire Publications, 2001), p. 15.", "In 1791, the industry provided (often part-time) employment to as many as 105,000 women and children in Scotland, or approximately 86% of the entire workforce.Anthony Cooke, The Rise and Fall of the Scottish Cotton Industry, 1778-1914 (Manchester University Press, 2010), p. 42-3.
