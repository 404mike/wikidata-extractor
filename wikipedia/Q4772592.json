She also wrote fiction as Anne Meredith and the autobiography Three-a-Penny (1940) under the Meredith name.Lucy Malleson was born in London. When her stockbroker father lost his job the family suffered financial hardship, and she took up shorthand typing to earn a living. She began writing poetry, and then, inspired by the play The Cat and the Canary by John Willard (1922), she tried her hand at detective novels, using the name J Kilmeny Keith. The first was The Man Who Was London, published in 1925. She published over sixty crime novels as Anthony Gilbert, most of which featured her best-known character, Arthur Crook. Crook is a vulgar London lawyer totally (and deliberately) unlike the sophisticated detectives, such as Lord Peter Wimsey and Philo Vance, who dominated the mystery field when Gilbert introduced him. Instead of dispassionately analysing a case, he usually enters it after seemingly damning evidence has built up against his client, then conducts a no-holds-barred investigation of doubtful ethics to clear him or her. As fellow mystery author Michael Gilbert noted, \"...he behaved in a way which befitted his name and would not have been approved by the Law Society.\"  The first Crook novel, Murder by Experts, was published in 1936 and was immediately popular. The last Crook novel, A Nice Little Killing, was published in 1974.\nHer novel The Vanishing Corpse (1941) was adapted as the film They Met in the Dark (1943), another novel, The Mouse Who Wouldn't Play Ball (1943) was filmed as Candles at Nine in 1944, and her novel on abduction and a faked identity, The Woman in Red, which features Arthur Crook and his assistant Bill Parsons (1941), was adapted as the 1945 film noir, My Name Is Julia Ross. \"You'll Be the Death of Me,\" an October 1963 episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, was adapted from Gilbert's short story \"The Goldfish Button\" in the February 1958 Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine. Her short stories \"Door to a Different World\" and \"Fifty Years After\" were Edgar Award nominees.\nThe 1942 novel Something Nasty in the Woodshed (American title Mystery in the Woodshed) was adapted for stage by Dennis Hoey as The Haven, opening in New York in 1946. Cook was played by Melville Cooper. The production received poor reviews and lasted only five performances.While Malleson's books sold well enough to keep publishers asking for more, she was never a best-seller. However, in 2017 interest in her was revived through the reissue of the Anne Meredith crime novel Portrait of a Murderer under the British Library's Crime Classics imprint. Martin Edwards believes this novel to be \"a major departure. Dostoevsky was her model, although Anthony Berkeley's influence was also in play.\" Although quickly forgotten in 1933 it did win the praise of Dorothy L Sayers. The reissue sold many more copies than the original edition, and was followed by a reissue of the 1933 Anthony Gilbert novel, Death in Fancy Dress, as well as the Anne Meredith autobiography Three-a-Penny in December 2019. The title of the latter was taken from a remark made to her by Sayers: \u201cAlthough authors are three-a-penny to us, they are quite exciting to other people.\u201d  Three-a-Penny was also serialised on BBC Radio 4. The book also paints a vivid portrait of poverty between the wars in the East End of London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1933 in literature", "response": ["*Anthony Gilbert \u2013 Death in Fancy Dress"]}, {"page": "1936 in literature", "response": ["*Anthony Gilbert \u2013 Murder by Experts"]}, {"page": "1943 in literature", "response": ["*Anthony Gilbert \u2013 The Mouse Who Wouldn't Play Ball"]}, {"page": "1950 in literature", "response": ["* Anthony Gilbert \u2013 A Nice Cup of Tea"]}, {"page": "1973 in literature", "response": ["*December 9 \u2013 Anthony Gilbert, English crime writer (born 1899)"]}, {"page": "List of crime writers", "response": ["*Anthony Gilbert (1889\u20131973, E), pseudonym of Lucy Beatrice Malleson"]}, {"page": "Miles Malleson", "response": ["Malleson was born in Avondale Road, South Croydon, Surrey, England, the son of Edmund Taylor Malleson (1859-1909), a manufacturing chemist, and Myrrha Bithynia Frances Borrell (1863-1931), a descendant of the numismatist Henry Perigal Borrell and the inventor Francis Maceroni.

", "Film critic Bosley Crowther wrote a mixed review: \"The director and scenarist of the Ambassador's new mystery, My Name Is Julia Ross, deserve a B-plus for effort at least. It is quite evident that they strived earnestly to whip up excitement and suspense, but somehow that electrifying quality which distinguishes good melodrama is lacking in this transcription of the Anthony Gilbert novel, The Woman in Red ... While Joseph Lewis, the director, succeeds in creating an effectively ominous atmosphere, he has not been as adept in handling the players, and that, we suspect, is why My Name Is Julia Ross misses the mark.Crowther, Bosly.
