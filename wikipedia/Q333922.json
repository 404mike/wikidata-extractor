He was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.  In his time as a student there, he achieved distinction in both poetry and mathematics.\nWhat is most often remarked about Whewell is the breadth of his endeavors.  In a time of increasing specialization, Whewell appears a throwback to an earlier era when natural philosophers dabbled in a bit of everything.  He published work in the disciplines of mechanics, physics, geology, astronomy, and economics, while also finding the time to compose poetry, author a Bridgewater Treatise, translate the works of Goethe, and write sermons and theological tracts.  In mathematics, Whewell introduced what is now called the Whewell equation, an equation defining the shape of a curve without reference to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system. He also organized thousands of volunteers internationally to study ocean tides, in what is now considered one of the first citizen science projects. He received the Royal Medal for this work in 1837.One of Whewell's greatest gifts to science was his wordsmithing.  He often corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with new terms for their discoveries. Whewell coined the terms scientist, physicist, linguistics, consilience, catastrophism, uniformitarianism, and astigmatism amongst others; Whewell suggested the terms electrode, ion, dielectric, anode, and cathode to Michael Faraday.Whewell died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Augustin-Jean Fresnel", "response": ["The economy of assumptions under the wave theory was emphasized by William Whewell in his History of the Inductive Sciences, first published in 1837. In the corpuscular system, \"every new class of facts requires a new supposition,\" whereas in the wave system, a hypothesis devised in order to explain one phenomenon is then found to explain or predict others. In the corpuscular system there is \"no unexpected success, no happy coincidence, no convergence of principles from remote quarters\"; but in the wave system, \"all tends to unity and simplicity.\"Whewell, 1857, pp.\u00a0340\u201341; the quoted paragraphs date from the 1st Ed.\u00a0(1837).", "* William Whewell, in all three editions of his History of the Inductive Sciences (1837, 1847, and 1857), at the end of Book\u00a0, compared the histories of physical astronomy and physical optics and concluded:It would, perhaps, be too fanciful to attempt to establish a parallelism between the prominent persons who figure in these two histories. If we were to do this, we must consider Huyghens and Hooke as standing in the place of Copernicus, since, like him, they announced the true theory, but left it to a future age to give it development and mechanical confirmation; Malus and Brewster, grouping them together, correspond to Tycho Brahe and Kepler, laborious in accumulating observations, inventive and happy in discovering laws of phenomena; and Young and Fresnel combined, make up the Newton of optical science.Whewell, 1857, pp.\u00a0370\u201371."]}, {"page": "Anode", "response": ["The word was coined in 1834 from the Greek \u1f04\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 (anodos), 'ascent', by William Whewell, who had been consulted by Michael Faraday over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of electrolysis.

Not a conventional resident don, and inattentive to his teaching responsibilities, he wrote three topical books during this period of his life. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832. Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues: George Biddell Airy, his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge,George Biddell Airy#Biography thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing. Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on political economy. Babbage's reforming direction looked to see university education more inclusive, universities doing more for research, a broader syllabus and more interest in applications; but William Whewell found the programme unacceptable. A controversy Babbage had with Richard Jones lasted for six years. He never did give a lecture."]}, {"page": "Carl Friedrich Gauss", "response": ["In connection to this, there is a record of a conversation between Rudolf Wagner and Gauss, in which they discussed William Whewell's book Of the Plurality of Worlds. In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed. Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the Bible, though he confessed that he \"envied\" those who were able to easily believe. This later led them to discuss the topic of faith, and in some other religious remarks, Gauss said that he had been more influenced by theologians like Lutheran minister Paul Gerhardt than by Moses. Other religious influences included Wilhelm Braubach, Johann Peter S\u00fcssmilch, and the New Testament. Two religious works which Gauss read frequently were Braubach's Seelenlehre (Giessen, 1843) and S\u00fcssmilch's Gottliche (Ordnung gerettet A756); he also devoted considerable time to the New Testament in the original Greek."]}, {"page": "Cathode", "response": ["The word was coined in 1834 from the Greek \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 (kathodos), 'descent' or 'way down', by William Whewell, who had been consulted by Michael Faraday over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of electrolysis.

He is best known as the author of Principles of Geology (1830\u201333), which presented to a wide public audience the idea that the earth was shaped by the same natural processes still in operation today, operating at similar intensities. The philosopher William Whewell termed this gradualistic view \"uniformitarianism\" and contrasted it with catastrophism, which had been championed by Georges Cuvier and was better accepted in Europe. The combination of evidence and eloquence in Principles convinced a wide range of readers of the significance of \"deep time\" for understanding the earth and environment.", "Lyell saw himself as \"the spiritual saviour of geology, freeing the science from the old dispensation of Moses.\" The two terms, uniformitarianism and catastrophism, were both coined by William Whewell;Whewell, William 1837.
