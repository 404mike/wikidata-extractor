At a muscular twenty-six, Jackson was five years younger than Mendoza's weary thirty-one,  taller, and  heavier.  Two hundred guineas, or a little over two hundred British pounds were laid on each side, and the future King William IV was among the audience. The bout was only Jackson's third professional fight, but Mendoza's age, months in prison, and years of punishment gave the advantage to the less battered Jackson. The bigger man won in nine rounds, paving the way to victory by muscling Mendoza into the corner of the ring, grabbing his hair, and pummeling his head with uppercuts using his free hand. Mendoza managed to come back up to scratch after this, but was soon knocked out. Jackson beat him into submission by the end of the 9th round. Mendoza asked for a foul for the hair pulling, but it was ruled to be legal at the time. Many pugilists, such as James Figg and Jack Broughton, shaved their heads to avoid the possibility of this, until hair-pulling was eventually banned in boxing. Mendoza retired after his loss, and though he attempted boxing comebacks, he never again enjoyed the same size audiences or received large purses.Defeated by John Jackson in The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame, Blady, Ken, (1988) Shapolsky Publishers, Inc., New York, NY, pps. 13\u201314. Although Mendoza continued sparring tours well into the nineteenth century, 1795 marked the beginning of a steep decline in his popularity and for the most part, his income.  He very rarely appeared in the London newspapers after this period, and had lost respect with much of the public.Brodie, Daniel, \"The Jewish Strong Man\", pg. 88"]}, {"page": "1845 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 7 October \u2013 John Jackson, boxer (born 1769)"]}, {"page": "1769 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 28 September \u2013 John Jackson, boxer (died 1845)"]}, {"page": "Rodney Stone", "response": ["The eponymous narrator is a Sussex country boy who is the son of a sailor and wishes to go to sea himself.

The novel interweaves Rodney's coming-of-age story with that of his friend Boy Jim's boxing endeavours. Jim has been brought up by a blacksmith whom he believes to be his uncle - the blacksmith Harrison was a famous former boxer and the 'nephew' wishes to fight too.
