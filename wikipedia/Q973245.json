The dove and olive branch was used symbolically by early Christians and then eventually became a secular peace symbol, popularized by a Dove lithograph by Pablo Picasso after World War II. In the 1950s the \"peace sign\", as it is known today (also known as \"peace and love\"), was designed by Gerald Holtom as the logo for the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), a group at the forefront of the peace movement in the UK, and adopted by anti-war and counterculture activists in the US and elsewhere. The symbol is a super-imposition of the semaphore signals for the letters \"N\" and \"D\", taken to stand  for \"nuclear disarmament\", while simultaneously acting as a reference to Goya's The Third of May 1808  (1814) (aka \"Peasant Before the Firing Squad\").", "The symbol was designed by Gerald Holtom  (1914\u20131985) for the British nuclear disarmament movement. Holtom, an artist and designer, presented it to the Direct Action Committee on 21 February 1958 where it was \"immediately accepted\" as a symbol for a march from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire on 4 April.\"  Holtom's design was adapted by Eric Austen (1922\u20131999) to ceramic lapel badges. The original design is in the Peace Museum in Bradford, England.", "Gerald Holtom had originally considered using a Christian cross symbol within a circle, but he was dissuaded by several priests who expressed reservations towards using the cross on a protest march. Holtom's symbol was nevertheless compared to the Christian cross symbol, as well as to the death rune (the inverted \u16d8 rune associated with death in early 20th century esotericism).\"In the past, a very similar inverted cross was known to represent Peter hanging upside down on the cross. When that symbol was placed on the door, it was a sign to persecuted Christians that there would be church services in that home.\"  Pasadena Star-News 8 May 1968, cited after George Stanford, The Myth of the Witch's Foot: How the John Birch Society Created a Hoax About the Peace Sign, Monday, 3 December 2012.", "* Happy Birthday Peace \u2013 celebrating 50 years of Gerald Holtom's peace symbol"]}, {"page": "1958 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 25 February \u2013 Bertrand Russell launches the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, initiated at a meeting called by Canon John Collins on 15 January.

Although they do not carry flags, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers have used hand semaphore in this manner. Some surf-side rescue companies, such as the Ocean City, Maryland Beach Patrol, use semaphore flags to communicate between lifeguards. The letters of the flag semaphore are also a common artistic motif. One enduring example is the peace symbol, adopted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958 from the original logo created by a commercial artist named Gerald Holtom from Twickenham, London, using the semaphore for N and D. Holtom designed the logo for use on a protest march on the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, near Newbury, England. On 4 April 1958, the march left Trafalgar Square for rural Berkshire, carrying Ban the Bomb placards made by Holtom's children making it the first use of the symbol.
