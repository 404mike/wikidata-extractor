He made seventy two first-class appearances for Yorkshire between 1855 and 1876, scoring 1,916 runs at an average of 20.60, and taking 102 wickets at 15.09.\nBorn in Bedale, Yorkshire, to Roger and Jane Iddison, Iddison was a right-handed batsman who also bowled right-arm underarm slow lobs.  He was noted for his fielding at point.\nHis father was a guano merchant with a shop in Market Place, Bedale.  Roger had a younger brother, William Holdsworth Iddison, who also played first-class cricket.  Roger Iddison was first a butcher by trade, then kept a shop for cricket articles in Manchester (1864).\nHe was part of the first team of English cricketers to tour Australia. The team travelled on the SS Great Britain. Each player was paid \u00a3150.00 and guaranteed first class travelling expenses by the sponsors, Melbourne based businessmen Spiers and Pond. They played 15 matches in Australia between 1 January and 22 March 1862.  He played his first match at Lord's between 9 and 11 June 1862.\nIn 1869, Iddison played in 27 first-class matches and made 1,059 runs. Together with George Freeman he founded the United North of England Eleven in 1869.  He was the professional at Harrow School from 1871-2; and joint secretary with C D Barstow of the Yorkshire United Eleven in 1874.\nHe was a commission agent at York from 1870, until his death in York in 1890.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The first club President was former player Thomas Barker, who had become Mayor of Sheffield, although he probably never attended any meetings. Michael Ellison was the first club Treasurer and at some point early in Yorkshire's history, he assumed the Presidency. Most official accounts record Ellison as Yorkshire's first President. Joseph (\"J. B.\") Wostinholm became the first of four long-serving club Secretaries in 1864. The first team captain was Roger Iddison, a professional cricketer.", "In 1865, the club and players became involved in a dispute. Five players \u2013 Roger Iddison, George Anderson, George Atkinson, Joseph Rowbotham and Ned Stephenson \u2013 refused to play against Surrey. This concerned a controversy that arose in 1862 when Iddison and Anderson played for an All-England team against Surrey at The Oval and the Kent bowler Edgar Willsher was repeatedly no-balled for using an overarm action by an umpire whom, they claimed, had been appointed by Surrey specifically for that purpose. Anderson stated in 1865 that he \"would not play against those who have combined to sweep us from the cricket field altogether if they could\".", "The team faded again in 1882 and Hawke, who had refused the captaincy earlier, was appointed team captain at the end of the season, the first amateur to hold this position. Previous captains had all been professionals: Roger Iddison (1863\u201372), Joseph Rowbotham (1873 and 1875), Luke Greenwood (1874), Ephraim Lockwood (1876\u201377) and Tom Emmett (1878\u201382).
