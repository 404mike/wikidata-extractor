Merriam-Webster defines competition in business as \"the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favourable terms\".

Smith and other classical economists before Antoine Augustine Cournot were referring to price and non-price rivalry among producers to sell their goods on best terms by bidding of buyers, not necessarily to a large number of sellers nor to a market in final equilibrium.Mark Blaug, 2008. \"Invisible hand\", The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition, v. 4, p. 565. Abstract . Competition is widespread throughout the market process. It is a condition where \"buyers tend to compete with other buyers, and sellers tend to compete with other sellers\". In offering goods for exchange, buyers competitively bid to purchase specific quantities of specific goods which are available, or might be available if sellers were to choose to offer such goods. Similarly, sellers bid against other sellers in offering goods on the market, competing for the attention and exchange resources of buyers. Competition results from scarcity, as it is not possible to satisfy all conceivable human wants, and occurs as people try to meet the criteria being used to determine allocation."]}, {"page": "Economist", "response": ["* Mark Blaug and Howard R.

Mark Blaug presents the first revisionist analysis of the Poor Law in \"The Myth of the Old Poor Law and the making of the New\", commenting that the Old Poor Law did not reduce the efficiency of agricultural workers, lower wages, depress rents or compound the burden on rate payers.Blaug, Mark, \"The Poor Law Report Reexamined\", The Journal of Economic History, Vol. 24, No. 2 (June 1964), pp. 229\u201345. Blaug argues that Old Poor Law was a device \"for dealing with the problems of structural unemployment and substandard wages in the lagging rural sector of a rapidly growing but still underdeveloped economy\". Other areas of Poor Law which have concerned historians include the extent to which the Second Great Reform Act contributed to the Poor Law Amendment ActRees, Rosmary, Poverty and Public Health, 1815\u20131948, p. 33 and the extent to which outdoor relief was abolished following the New Poor Law.Rose, Michael E.

Allowances or supplements to wages were used generally as a temporary measure and the way they operated differed between regions. Mark Blaug's 1960 essay The Myth of the Old Poor Law charged the commissioners of 1834 with largely using the Speenhamland system to vilify the old poor law and create a will for the passage of a new one. However, historians such as Eric Hobsbawm have argued that the old poor law was still damaging by subsidising employers, and heightening dependency of workers'  incomes on local aristocrats.part 3(1)"]}, {"page": "Classical economics", "response": ["* Mark Blaug (1987). \"classical economics,\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, v. 1, pp.\u00a0414\u201345."]}, {"page": "Methodological individualism", "response": ["Economist Mark Blaug has criticized over-reliance on methodological individualism in economics, saying that \"it is helpful to note what methodological individualism strictly interpreted [...] would imply for economics.

Aristotle developed a fairly sophisticated theory of money, and in chapter 9 of Book 1 of his Politics, he describes the circuits of commodity trade C-M-C' (oekonomia) and M-C-M' (chrematistikon).This is explained by Marx in his book A contribution to the critique of political economy (1859).
