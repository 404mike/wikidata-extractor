He led the development of the offside priority rule at roundabouts \u2013 which overcame capacity and safety issues at such installations, greatly increasing their usefulness and popularity around the world \u2013 and subsequently also invented the mini roundabout.Blackmore was born in 1916 at Fort National, Algeria, where his father worked as a missionary. Along with his sisters Lorna and Violette and brother William, he later moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, the birth country of his mother. He studied civil engineering until moving to Britain in 1936. He started to work for Colchester borough council until the outbreak of World War II when he joined the Royal Air Force. He was awarded the Air Force Cross for his actions when he made an emergency landing on the beach at Ardnamurchan Point. He rose to the rank of Wing Commander and remained with the RAF until 1959.\nIn 1960 he joined the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). During his time with the TRL he came up with several ideas to improve the flow of traffic at junctions: in particular, the offside-priority rule at roundabouts, and the mini-roundabout, which was officially adopted in 1975.Blackmore was honoured with an OBE in 1976. He left the TRL in 1980. After he retired he continued to work as an overseas consultant in Bangkok, Baghdad, and California.\nBlackmore died on 5 June 2008. He is survived by two daughters and a son. His first wife, Ginon Dufour, died of tuberculosis in 1942. His second marriage to Eva Johnson was dissolved in 1969.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roundabout", "response": ["Widespread use of the modern roundabout began when the UK's Transport Research Laboratory engineers re-engineered and standardised circular intersections during the 1960s.

The priority rule was found to improve traffic flow by up to 10%.Clint Pumphrey. \"How Roundabouts Work\". howstuffworks.com In 1966, the United Kingdom adopted a rule at all circular junctions that required entering traffic to give way to circulating traffic. A Transportation Research Board guide reports that the modern roundabout represents a significant improvement, in terms of both operations and safety, when compared with older rotaries and traffic circles. The design became mandatory in the United Kingdom for all new roundabouts in November 1966. Australia and other British-influenced countries were the first outside the UK to build modern roundabouts.", "In the United States modern roundabouts emerged in the 1990s after years of planning and educational campaigning by Frank Blackmore and Leif Ourston, who sought to bring the by then well-established increased safety and traffic flow in other countries to America. The very first was constructed in Summerlin, Nevada in the summer of 1990. This roundabout occasioned dismay from residents, and a local news program said about it, \"Even police agree, [roundabouts] can be confusing at times.\" Between 1990 and 1995, numerous modern roundabounts were built in California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and Vermont.", "After developing the offside priority rule, Frank Blackmore, of the UK's Transport Research Laboratory, turned his attention to the possibility of a roundabout that could be built at sites lacking room for a conventional roundabout.", "\"Magic roundabouts\" direct traffic in both directions around the central island. They are officially known as \"ring junctions\". The first magic roundabout was constructed in 1972 in Swindon, Wiltshire, United Kingdom, designed by Frank Blackmore, inventor of the mini-roundabout. The roundabout joins five roads and consists of a two-way road around the central island, with five mini-roundabouts meeting the incoming roads."]}, {"page": "Magic Roundabout (Swindon)", "response": ["The roundabout was constructed according to the design of Frank Blackmore, of the British Transport and Road Research Laboratory.
