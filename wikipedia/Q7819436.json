Ultimately the RAOU contributed to the success of the IOC through provision of funding (along with the Australian Academy of Science (AAC) and the administrative assistance of the CSIRO), and with the organisation of excursions for delegates. The appointment in 1974 of Tommy Garnett as RAOU secretary was also a move that assisted in bringing order to the growing administrative demands of the evolving organisation."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2006", "response": ["*Tommy Garnett, 91, English-born Australian cricketer and educator."]}, {"page": "2006 in birding and ornithology", "response": ["* 22 September - Tommy Garnett"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Tommy Garnett (1915\u20132006), Australian horticulturalist and English cricketer who played five first-class matches"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Tommy Garnett (1935\u20131939) 5 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Alister Clark", "response": ["Clark was also a keen breeder of daffodils.
