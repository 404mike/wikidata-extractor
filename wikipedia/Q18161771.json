The first genre to really embrace African influenced music and push it into the mainstream was UK funky via artists such as Donae'o, and in early-2010s, afrobeats, with artists such as Mista Silva, Kwamz, Fuse ODG, and Timbo gaining mainstream success through their afrobeats sound. Around the same time, artists such as Sneakbo and Timbo were incorporating melodic rap and Caribbean influences into their music. These artists collectively set the foundation for what would later turn into afroswing, and contributed to the rise of youth embracing their African heritage. In 2010, Sneakbo released \"Touch Ah Button\", an early example of the merger of dancehall and afrobeats influences. In February 2014, Timbo and Mover released \"Ringtone\", which DJ Kenny Allstar credited as opening \"the door to the bridge of Afro-rap and the evolution of Afroswing, which was essentially someone laying a hook over a rap record\"."]}, {"page": "Afrobeats", "response": ["However it wasn't until the launch of Choice FM's New Afrobeats Radio Show' birthed and presented by DJ Abrantee in April 2011 that the genre gained traction and saw 'Afrobeats' trending for the first time in history. The launch of the show gained popularity and provided a launch pad for both UK Based and African artists to submit songs for playlist consideration. Abrantee used his daytime show to test day time play of Afrobeats. Some of the first Afrobeats songs to be playlisted on daytime radio across the UK were Mista Silva \"Boom Boom tah\", May7ven's \"Ten Ten\", D'Banj's \"Oliver Twist\", and Moelogo's \"Pangolo\" in March 2012.
