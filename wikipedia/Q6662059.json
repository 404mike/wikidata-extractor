Malek was the first CMS mission in southern Sudan.  Angus Cameron, the Governor of Mongalla, had discouraged the missionaries from settling Mongalla and suggested a site downriver, 18 kilometers south of  Bor.  Llewellyn Gwynne oversaw the group that established the Malek Mission in early 1906.  It consisted of  Rev. Archibald Shaw, Rev. Arthur Thom, Rev. F.B. Hadow, Dr. Lloyd, Mr. Comely, and Mr. Wilmott.  The mission closed (temporarily) fewer than two years later, in May 1908, when only Archibald Shaw remained there; the others had all left, owing to a combination of ill-health and frustration.
