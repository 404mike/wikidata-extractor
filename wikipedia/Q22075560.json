Benzine quoted Kiva Reardon, at TIFF, who disputed Venice's festival's director, Alberta Barbera's claim that the reason he hadn't scheduled more films from female directors was that they just weren't making enough good films.  \nIn 2020, he made the documentary The Curve, which is about America's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was released on the internet a week before the 2020 United States presidential election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shoah (film)", "response": ["Previously unseen Shoah outtakes have been featured in Adam Benzine's Oscar-nominated HBO documentary Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah (2015), which examines Lanzmann's life from 1973 to 1985, the years he spent making Shoah.Claude Lanzmann Attending Oscars for First Time - Variety"]}, {"page": "Brunel University London", "response": ["* Adam Benzine, (Multimedia Technology & Design), Oscar-nominated filmmaker and journalist"]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)", "response": ["| Adam Benzine"]}, {"page": "List of documentary films", "response": ["|Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah||2015||Adam Benzine||Adam Benzine, Kimberley Warner", "|Curve, The||2020||Adam Benzine||Adam Benzine"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["|Adam Benzine"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2016", "response": ["* Adam Benzine (Best Documentary \u2013 Short Subject) \u2013 Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah"]}, {"page": "88th Academy Awards", "response": ["** Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah\u00a0\u2013 Adam Benzine"]}, {"page": "Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah", "response": ["Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah is a 2015 documentary-short film exploring the life and work of French director Claude Lanzmann.
