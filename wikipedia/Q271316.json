She began her career as a 400 metres hurdles specialist before concentrating on the 400 metres from 2006 onwards. Her 400 metres personal best is 49.65 seconds. She holds the British indoor record with 50.02 seconds, which ranks her as the fifth fastest woman of all-time indoors.\nSanders career peaked in 2007 when she won the 400 metres at the 2007 European Indoor Championships (breaking the British Indoor record), and ran a personal best to win the silver medal at the 2007 World Championships behind compatriot Christine Ohuruogu. In the 4\u00d7400 metres relay, she won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics (retroactively awarded in 2017) and a gold medal at the 2012 World Indoor Championships. She also won four World Championship relay bronzes. After two years of struggling with injury, she announced her retirement from athletics in October 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "High Wycombe", "response": ["*Nicola Sanders \u2013 former track and field athlete, Olympic bronze medal winner."]}, {"page": "400 metres", "response": ["|Nicola Sanders"]}, {"page": "2005 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|Lee McConnellDonna FraserNicola SandersChristine Ohuruogu|| 3:24.44SB "]}, {"page": "Sanya Richards-Ross", "response": ["For the 2007 season, Richards-Ross decided to expand her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, racing more 200-meter sprints and testing her ability to possibly pursue the rare 200\u2013400 meters double Olympic victory in Beijing the following year. Only a handful of athletes have ever achieved such a feat, including Michael Johnson, her coach Clyde Hart's world-record-setting pupil. Things strayed from her plan, as she finished fourth in the 400 meters event at the 2007 U.S. national championships, only qualifying for the 2007 Osaka World Championships by placing second in the 200 meters, behind reigning 200 meters world champion Allyson Felix. In Osaka, Richards-Ross ran 22.70 seconds to finish fifth, as teammate Felix successfully defended her title from two years ago. Both American women reunited for the women's 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay, helping Team USA win gold, ahead of the Jamaican team and the British team, which featured the new 400 meters world champion Christine Ohuruogu and 400 meters silver medalist Nicola Sanders. Despite failing to qualify in her signature event at the national championships and leaving Osaka with only a spectator's memory of the individual race, the 23-year-old American woman still finished the year undefeated in the six Golden League 400-meter races and with the number one world ranking. Reflecting on her season, she admitted that losing focus on the quarter-mile race was the reason for her defeat, after constantly shifting mindsets and strategies to race the 100, 200, and 400 meters throughout the season."]}, {"page": "St Mary's University, Twickenham", "response": ["* Nicola Sanders, Olympic sprinter and hurdler"]}, {"page": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["|Christine Ohuruogu, Marilyn Okoro, Lee McConnell, Nicola Sanders", "|Shana CoxNicola SandersChristine OhuruoguPerri Shakes-Drayton"]}, {"page": "2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships", "response": ["| Nicola Sanders   || 50.02  WL \u00a0 NR \u00a0 PB", "|   Emma Duck  Nicola Sanders  Kim Wall  Lee McConnell  || 3:28.69  NR \u00a0"]}, {"page": "Amersham School", "response": ["The school opened on its current site in 1964, although at that time it was the Brudenell County Secondary School for girls.
