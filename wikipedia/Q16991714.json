Among the teams that he played first-class games for were Cambridge University and the Gentlemen of England. He was born at Bag Enderby, Lincolnshire and died at Shawell, Leicestershire.\nThough his record is not impressive by modern standards, Elmhirst batted mostly in the middle order, and sometimes as an opening batsman, but it is not recorded whether he was right- or left-handed; he also kept wicket in some games.Elmhirst was ordained as a Church of England vicar after he left Trinity College, Cambridge in 1835 and served as rector of Shawell from 1841 until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Caroline Mary Luard", "response": ["Charles Edward Luard (1839\u20131908) was the second son of Robert Luard (1800\u20131880)Brother of John Luard and his first wife Mary n\u00e9e Elmhirst (1808\u20131841)Brother of Edward Elmhirst"]}, {"page": "Elmhirst", "response": ["* Edward Elmhirst (1811-1893), cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Edward Elmhirst"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Edward Elmhirst"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Edward Elmhirst (1848)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1827\u20131863)", "response": ["* Edward Elmhirst (1835\u20131851) : E.
