According to Horatio Gordon Robley, there are two main ideas behind the symbolism of hei-tiki: they are either memorials to ancestors, or represent the goddess of childbirth, Hineteiwaiwa. The rationale behind the first theory is that they were often buried when their kaitiaki (guardian) died and retrieved later to be placed somewhere special and brought out in times of tangihanga (mourning and associated activities). Because of the connection with Hineteiwaiwa, hei-tiki were often given to a woman by her husband's family if she was having trouble conceiving."]}, {"page": "Robley", "response": ["*Horatio Gordon Robley (1840\u20131930), British soldier, artist, and collector of the macabre"]}, {"page": "List of New Zealand artists", "response": ["* Horatio Gordon Robley (1840\u20131930) \u2013 19th-century sketch artist and watercolourist"]}, {"page": "Mokomokai", "response": ["Major-General Horatio Gordon Robley was a British army officer and artist who served in New Zealand during the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s. He was interested in ethnology and fascinated by the art of tattooing as well as being a talented illustrator. He wrote the classic text on the subject of moko, Moko; or Maori Tattooing, which was published in 1896. After he returned to England he built up a notable collection of 35 to 40 mokomokai which he later offered to sell to the New Zealand Government. When the offer was declined, most of the collection was sold to the American Museum of Natural History."]}, {"page": "Thomas Donne", "response": ["He was also a collector of M\u0101ori antiquities and New Zealand fine art. His interest in M\u0101ori matters led him to record his findings and articles of interest in scrapbooks. When he left New Zealand for London he took some of his collection with him but the remainder was sold at auction on 18 and 19 May 1909 by H.J. Bethune & Co. When in London he continued to develop his collection and corresponded, purchased and swapped artifacts, works on paper and artworks with numerous other collectors including Horatio Gordon Robley,; Kenneth Athol Webster; and Alfred Walter Francis Fuller. One of the prime pieces in his collection was a small carved house named Te Wharepuni-a-Maui. He had commissioned this house to be carved for him in 1905 by the carvers Tene Waitere, Neke Kapua and Eramiha Neke Kapua. Te Wharepuni-a-Maui was first situated at the Whakarewarewa model village in Rotorua before being rented to the New Zealand International Exhibition. Donne took this house with him when he left New Zealand and it is likely to have also been included in other exhibitions he contributed to as a staff member of the New Zealand High Commission. This house is now in the collection of Linden Museum. Another significant collection he was associated with was a collection of New Zealand jade. This collection began with the New Zealand collector John White. On White's death in 1904 the collection of jade was sold to an Englishman named J. Struan Robertson who was touring New Zealand. It was shipped to England but only unpacked after the death of Robertson in 1912. The collection was offered for sale to museums by his daughter but only selected pieces were purchased by the British Museum, Bristol Museum, the Pitt-Rivers Museum and Devizes Museum. The rest of the collection was purchased by Donne. Donne split the collection and retained the hei tiki, pendants and other special pieces. He sold the remainder to the Field Museum. Donne later sold the pieces he retained to Armytage. On the death of Armytage, Kenneth Athol Webster ensured that the Armytage collection of jade was repatriated to New Zealand museums."]}, {"page": "List of members of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders", "response": ["*Major General Horatio Gordon Robley, (1840\u20131930) "]}, {"page": "Horatio Robley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Horatio Gordon Robley"]}, {"page": "Tuterei Karewa", "response": ["Karewa was the subject of several pieces of work.  Photographer Arthur James Iles documented Karewa in a series of portraits of M\u0101ori between 1890 and 1920.

Iles subsequently used his work to have tin plates created overseas, one of which contained a small lithograph of Karewa on the outer edge of the plate among others.
