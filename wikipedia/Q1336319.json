William the Conqueror, who was a great lover of hunting, established and enforced a system of forest law. This operated outside the common law, and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from hunting by the common people of England and reserved hunting rights for the new French-speaking Anglo-Norman aristocracy. Henceforth hunting of game in royal forests by commoners or in other words poaching, was invariably punishable by death by hanging. In 1087, a poem called \"The Rime of King William\" contained in the Peterborough Chronicle, expressed English indignation at the severe new laws. Poaching was romanticised in literature from the time of the ballads of Robin Hood, as an aspect of the \"greenwood\" of Merry England; in one tale, Robin Hood is depicted as offering King Richard the Lion Heart venison from deer illegally hunted in the Sherwood Forest, the King overlooking the fact that this hunting was a capital offence.  The widespread acceptance of this common criminal activity is encapsulated in the observation Non est inquirendum, unde venit venison (\"It is not to be inquired, whence comes the venison\"), made by Guillaume Bud\u00e9 in his Traitte de la v\u00e9nerie.Bud\u00e9, G.

On 1 March 1647, the House of Commons resolved \"That the Town and Castle of Monmouth be disgarisoned, and the Works slighted\". The demolition process began with the round tower on 30 March 1647. The events were recorded in the diary, now lost, of More Pye, then usher at Monmouth School. The demolition took months, and Pye's diary also recorded the collapse on 22 December 1647; \"about twelve o'clock, the Tower in the Castle of Monmouth fell down, upon one side, whilst we were at sermon\". William Gilpin, visiting Monmouth on his Wye Tour, described the castle's decline by the end of the 18th century; \"The transmutations of time are often ludicrous... formerly the palace of a king, and birth-place of a mighty prince: it is now converted into a yard for fatting ducks\".

As a result, the Wye Valley was more or less constantly associated with the Picturesque, and as public awareness and appreciation for the Picturesque increased, so too did the popularity of the Wye Tour."]}]}}
