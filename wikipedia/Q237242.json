Probably her best-known novel, Unexplained Laughter (1985), was adapted for UK television, as was her Summerhouse Trilogy. Her novel The 27th Kingdom (1982) was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. In a New York Times article, Margalit Fox described her work:Shot through with melancholy, Ms. Ellis's novels focus on the small savageries, deep discontents and abiding grief of women's lives. Yet they are also mordantly funny sendups of bourgeois manners. Sometimes, as in the work of Shirley Jackson, the gothic overlays the domestic, to unsettling effect. Many of Ms. Ellis's characters are repellent, and they are meant to be. Ellis's cookery books include All-natural Baby Food (Fontana/Collins, 1977) and Darling, you shouldn't have gone to so much trouble, co-written with Caroline Blackwood. Blackwood and her poet husband, Robert Lowell, were frequent visitors to the Haycraft home.
