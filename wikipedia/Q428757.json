However, Tranmere returned to the Fourth Division in 1975.

From there he worked on World of Sport and On the Ball, where he struck up a partnership with Ian St John. Greg Dyke also hired Greaves to work as a television reviewer and presenter on TV-am in what Dyke admitted was a way of \"dumbing down\" the programme to attract more viewers. From October 1985 to April 1992 he and St. John presented a popular Saturday lunchtime football programme called Saint and Greavsie. He went on to work as a team captain on Sporting Triangles, opposite Andy Gray and Emlyn Hughes. His career in television came to an end as the Premier League was starting up, and he believed that his light-hearted approach to football was not considered serious enough for television bosses at the time.

Robertson was capped once for Scotland in a November 1961 World Cup qualification play-off against Czechoslovakia, setting up both Scotland goals for Ian St John in a 4\u20132 defeat.

Interest in the club was at an all-time high and a record crowd of 8,000 crammed into Connel Park to see Glens' Scottish Junior Cup fifth round tie against Kilsyth Rangers in January 1957. The confines of the old ground, surrounded by old miners rows one mile from the village, led the committee to seek an alternative ground and the 1959\u201360 season would be the last at Connel Park. The club's new Loch Park ground in the centre of New Cumnock was formally opened in August 1960 with a league game against Cumnock Juniors. The match was ceremonially kicked off by then Motherwell and Scotland star Ian St John, who had been a Junior player himself only three years previously.

With Sawyer's help, Shankly signed them both in the spring of 1961 and challenged the Liverpool board to sack him if they couldn't play.Shankly, pp. 90\u201391. At a press conference when Yeats came to Liverpool, Shankly emphasised Yeats' height by inviting the journalists to \"go and walk round him; he's a colossus!\"Kelly, p. 165. Goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came through the club's junior teams, so Shankly now had his \"strength through the middle\" and the team building continued with the acquisition of wing half Gordon Milne from Preston. Other players developed at Anfield were Jimmy Melia, Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and the future England internationals Gerry Byrne and Roger Hunt. Shankly said of goalscorer Hunt the first time he saw him: \"Christ, this one can play!\"Shankly, p. 91. Liverpool had finished third in both 1959\u201360 and 1960\u201361 (only the top two clubs were promoted); but the new team gained promotion in the 1961\u201362 season by winning the Second Division championship, Hunt scoring 41 goals.", "Liverpool made their European debut in 1964\u201365, competing in the European Cup and reaching the semi-finals. In the second round, the club was drawn against the formidable Anderlecht. Immediately before the match, Shankly decided to experiment with the Liverpool kit. Liverpool played in red shirts with white shorts and white socks with red stripes but Shankly and Ian St John had the idea of an all-red kit that would give the impression the players were taller. Liverpool played in all-red only for European matches but quickly adopted the colour permanently.Kelly, p. 199. Three days after winning the FA Cup, Liverpool defeated European champions Inter Milan 3\u20131 at Anfield in the semi-final first leg with a performance that was saluted by Inter's coach Helenio Herrera.Kelly, p. 208. The second leg at the San Siro remains controversial because, according to Shankly, the match was \"a war\" which Liverpool lost 3\u20130 and so were knocked out of the competition 4\u20133 on aggregate.Shankly, p. 105. Eleven years later, Shankly maintained that two of Inter's goals were illegal.Shankly, p. 106. Even today, the Liverpool website describes the match by saying that Liverpool were denied at the semi-final stage by a dishonest referee in Milan. According to Kelly, however, video evidence shows that the two disputed goals were actually legitimate.Kelly, p. 210. Shankly said after the defeat in Milan that the Inter fans were going mad because they were so pleased to have beaten Liverpool and he insisted it proved the high standard to which the Liverpool team had raised itself. In the 1964\u201365 Football League Championship, Liverpool dropped from first to seventh with 13 fewer points than the previous season, perhaps due to the exertion of lengthy participation in the FA and European Cups.", "Stephen Kelly, in his 1997 biography of Shankly, calls him \"the ultimate obsessive\". Shankly was fanatical about Liverpool and about football in general. From coaching his players and arguing with journalists to buttonholing fans in pubs, all Shankly ever wanted to do was talk about football and to be involved in football.Kelly, p. 3. As a result, he had few interests outside the game other than his family. His wife Nessie told Kelly that Shankly would spend time in the garden, mowing and weeding.Kelly, p. 293. She could rely on him to clean the cooker when Liverpool lost. Family holidays were limited to a week in Blackpool, where they always stayed at the Norbreck Hotel. One non-football activity that Shankly did enjoy was playing cards and Ian St John said he loved it, always taking part on long coach trips to away matches.St John, p. 119.", "Kelly wrote that, although it was said half-jokingly, so far as Shankly was concerned there was a degree of truth in what he had said. Shankly had fully realised the importance of football to its die-hard fans, himself included. It had become too important.Kelly, p. 290. Ian St John agreed that much of Shankly's behaviour was \"bizarre\", but everything was done with a purpose because Shankly always knew what he was doing and what he was saying.St John, p. 92."]}, {"page": "Football chant", "response": ["Chants became more extensive in the 1960s, and popular songs became increasingly common as the basis of chants as fans adapted these songs to reflect situations and events relevant to them.  Chanting the name of the team, chants for players and managers started to become prevalent. Liverpool supporters, particularly those on the Kop, were known for modifying songs in the early 1960s to suit their own purposes, and this practice quickly spread to fans of other clubs who created their own versions after hearing these chants. Liverpool fans, for example, honoured their player Ian St John with \"When the Saints Go Marching In\", a song that was also adopted by other clubs.  Fans of many clubs now have a large and constantly evolving repertoire of chants in addition to a smaller number of songs closely associated with their club."]}, {"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["United had a more promising 1962\u201363 campaign, finishing four points shy of promotion, though Bremner was limited to 24 appearances. He was out of form and dropped from the first team during the end of season run-in, which contained a disproportionately large number of games due to the high level of postponements that occurred during the harsh winter. Revie moved Bremner to central midfield, and bought Manchester United's Johnny Giles to create what would prove to be one of the most highly effective central midfield partnerships of the next 12 years. With Bremner, Collins and Giles in midfield, Leeds went on to win promotion as champions in the 1963\u201364 season. The club won no friends in doing so however, and the following summer were labelled by the Football Association's own FA News as \"the dirtiest [team] in the Football League. In November of the 1964\u201365 season Bremner featured heavily in a win at Everton that was marred by violent clashes on the pitch, the game was stopped for a short spell ten minutes before half-time as the referee felt that a spell of cooling down was needed to prevent further violence; despite the referee only giving 12 Leeds fouls to Everton's 19 the match helped to cement United's reputation as a dirty and overly physical team. A run of victories put the club top by the new year, however they lost the title on goal average to Manchester United after drawing the last game of the season with already-relegated Birmingham City. The Manchester club would become a keen rival, one which intensified after Leeds knocked them out of the FA Cup at the semi-finals after two physical encounters. Leeds faced Liverpool in the final at Wembley, and the game went to extra-time after a 0\u20130 draw; Bremner scored a half-volley in the 100th minute to cancel out Roger Hunt's opener, but Ian St John won the game for Liverpool in the 113th minute."]}]}}
