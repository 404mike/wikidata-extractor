As he is referred to in two different known sources as \"monsieur Duran\" it has been assumed that he was of French descent. This assumption has been bolstered by the rococo colors used in his paintings, which some sources have taken to suggest that if not born in France he was at least trained there. It appears more likely, however, that he is the same \"John Durand\" that was apprenticed to Charles Catton in London on September 15, 1760, for a seven-year term. Just when Durand emigrated is unknown; he is first recorded in Virginia in 1765, but by 1766 was in New York City, where an entry in the account book of James Beekman records payment to the artist for portraits of the six Beekman children. In 1767 he advertised the opening of a drawing school in New York, on Broad Street. New York remained his base of operations for some years, although signatures on a number of portraits indicate that he returned to Virginia in 1769, 1771, 1775, and 1780. According to his nephew, Robert Sully, he was prolific there; Sully wrote of him that \"He painted an immense number of portraits in Virginia; his works are hard and dry, but appear to have been strong likenesses, with less vulgarity of style than artists of his calibre generally possess.\"  He is known to have traveled to Connecticut twice for work; a 1768 advertisement from the Connecticut Journal survives, and suggests that he planned on a sojourn of at least a few months in the colony. A trip to Bermuda is also known. By 1770 he was in Virginia, working in Williamsburg and later in Petersburg. Durand drops out of sight as an artist after 1775, when he signed and dated a pair of portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Gray Briggs of Dinwiddie County, Virginia. It has been suggested that he remained in Virginia, as the only other references to him after that point are a painting from Virginia dated 1781 and an entry in the Dinwiddie County tax rolls of 1782. It has also been claimed that he was working in Chesterfield County in 1780. One source claims that he returned to England after this point, an assertion which does not appear to be supported anywhere else."]}, {"page": "Catton's English Peerage", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Catton"]}, {"page": "Street names of Holborn", "response": ["* Catton Street \u2013 after the 18th century painter Charles Catton who lived nearbyFairfield, S.
