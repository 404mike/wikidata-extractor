Deering, Nottinghamia vetus et nova: or, An historical account of the ancient and present state of the town of Nottingham (Nottingham, 1751), p. 99 Calverton's claim is probably the strongest, as the Lee surname appears in parish registers of the time and a William Lee \u2018the elder\u2019, whose death was recorded in 1607, bequeathed a gold ring to his eldest son, William, who may have been the inventor.M.

Failing to find much enthusiasm in this country for his ingenuity, Lee went to Rouen and set up stocking frames there, and is believed to have died in France, in obscurity, in about 1615. By the end of the seventeenth century however, stocking frames, perhaps the most complex piece of machinery employed in the pre-industrial age, were in widespread use in England and elsewhere."]}, {"page": "History of knitting", "response": ["The stocking frame or the mechanical knitting machine was invented in 1589 by William Lee, an English clergyman. After receiving a pair of black stockings from William, Queen Elizabeth I ultimately declined to grant him a patent for his invention. She complained that his machine-made wool stockings were far too coarse for royal ankles. She didn't like the feel of the stockings or their crude form and she was afraid that the machine would take away jobs from her people. However, France's King Henri IV saw the opportunity William's invention provided and offered him financial support. The inventor moved to Rouen where he built a stocking factory. Before long, the French spread the knitting loom throughout Europe. When the device came back to Great Britain, the Worshipful Company of Framework Knitters was incorporated in 1657 in London. Framework knitting was predominantly performed at home, often with the entire family participating."]}, {"page": "William Lee", "response": ["* William Lee, pen name used by William S.
