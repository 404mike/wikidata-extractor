He was not offered a professional contract with the Blades and so he went and played non-league football with Staveley Miners Welfare whilst learning to become an electrician. After a prolific season with Staveley he joined Mansfield Town in September 2009. He failed to break into the first team at Field Mill and after loan spells with Glapwell, Harrogate Town and FC Halifax Town he signed for the latter on a permanent basis. He became a regular goalscorer at The Shay helping them win the Northern Premier League Premier Division title in 2010\u201311 and promotion from the National League North via the play-offs in 2012\u201313. His goals earned him a move to Championship club Millwall in June 2014. Gregory scored 27 goals in 2015\u201316 and helped the Lions beat Bradford City in the 2017 EFL League One play-off Final. He scored 77 goals in 238 appearances for Millwall before joining Stoke City in June 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Millwall F.C.", "response": ["|2019|| Lee Gregory", "* Lee Gregory", "# 77 Lee Gregory (2014\u201319)"]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["In the club's first season in the Conference Premier he led Halifax to a fifth-place finish, securing a play-off spot. They lost out to Cambridge United at the play-off semi-final stage, squandering a 1\u20130 first leg lead after Lee Gregory had scored from the penalty spot. Halifax had a great start to the 2014\u201315 season and Aspin was named as the division's manager of the month after leading the club to five wins in six games in August. During that same month he signed a new two-year contract with the club. On 1 October, now aged 49, he played himself as a 69th-minute substitute for Lee Nogan in a 3\u20130 defeat at Guiseley in the first round of the West Riding County Cup. He was again named as Manager of the Month for February after Halifax rose to fourth-place with 14 points from an available 18, including four away victories. Halifax's promotion push collapsed at the end of the season, and they ended in ninth place on a run of just one win in their final 15 games. He was sacked on 17 September 2015 following what the board described as \"a prolonged period of indifferent results stretching back to February 2015\"."]}, {"page": "Gregory (surname)", "response": ["* Lee Gregory (baseball)", "* Lee Gregory (footballer)"]}]}}
