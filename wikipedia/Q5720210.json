Bach and Abel, continuing the tradition of subscription concerts they had started together in 1763, carried on organising festinos in the Rooms until 1783, when Gallini's father-in-law Lord Abingdon withdrew his financial support. Until his imprisonment in 1795 for libellous statements concerning a \"pettifogging lawyer\" who had allegedly cheated him, Lord Abingdon switched his allegiance to the rival orchestra in the Pantheon.  From 1783 to 1793 programming was arranged by the violinist Wilhelm Cramer who led the group \"The Professional Concerts\", advertised as founded by \"eminent professors of music, many years resident in London.\" The Rooms enjoyed royal patronage from 1785 to 1793, with George III and Queen Charlotte frequent concert-goers. The King even had a room set aside as the \"Queen's Tea Room,\" to which he donated a large gilt mirror for the mantelpiece. In 1776 parallel series of concerts was started in the Rooms by the violinist and impresario Johann Peter Salomon. The Rooms were used by the Concert of Ancient Music from 1804 onwards; for the annual benefit performance of Handel's Messiah for the Royal Society of Musicians from 1785 to 1848; from 1833 onwards by the Philharmonic Society, established in 1813 under patronage of the Prince Regent; and, from 1848 until its dissolution in 1861, by the Amateur Musical Society, a choral society founded by Henry David Leslie in 1847.  The estrangement in 1813 between the Prince Regent and Beau Brummell is reported to have taken place at a fancy dress ball in these Rooms, where Brummell, on not being recognized by the Prince, asked one of his companions in a stage whisper, \"Alvanley, who's your fat friend?\""]}, {"page": "Leslie (name)", "response": ["* Henry David Leslie (1822\u20131896), English composer and conductor"]}, {"page": "St Michael the Archangel, Llanyblodwel", "response": ["The churchyard contains the war graves of three British soldiers of World War I.CWGC Cemetery Report.
