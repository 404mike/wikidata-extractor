Nicholls left the band briefly in the late 1980s to form the alternative rock band Niadem's Ghost but returned in 1990. He is known for his entertaining if somewhat reticent and eccentric stage presence.\nAnother interest of Nicholls is painting; he painted the album covers for IQ's second, third and sixth albums, respectively Tales from the Lush Attic, The Wake and Ever, among others.\nIn the 1980s, Nicholls also worked as an editor and letterer for comics publishers London Editions Magazines.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "IQ (band)", "response": ["From 1982, the line-up consisted of Peter Nicholls (vocals), Mike Holmes (guitar), Martin Orford (keyboards), Paul Cook (not to be confused with the Sex Pistols' drummer of the same name) (drums), and Tim Esau (bass). Nicholls left in July 1985 to form a new band, Niadem's Ghost, and was replaced by Paul (P. L.) Menel, but subsequently returned in 1990. Nicholls also created the cover art for most of the albums on which he appears. In early 2005, member Paul Cook left the band and was replaced on drums by Andy Edwards (ex Robert Plant drummer). On 20 July 2007, Martin Orford announced that he was leaving IQ and he was replaced by Mark Westworth from prog-rock band Darwin's Radio. As of late 2009, Paul Cook has returned to replace Andy Edwards. On 7 October 2010, Mark Westworth announced on the band's official web site that he would be leaving the band and his final appearance with IQ was on 11 December 2010. On 1 January 2011, the band announced that Westworth's replacement on keyboards would be Neil Durant, from instrumental prog-fusion band Sphere\u00b3. On 7 January 2011, bassist of 19 years John Jowitt announced on the band's website that he had left the band, and that his last appearance with the band had also been the concert on 11 December 2010. He was replaced by original bassist Tim Esau in January 2011.", "The band's musical style, especially earlier in their career, was reminiscent of Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett era Genesis because of singer Peter Nicholls' vocal and stage-presence similarities to Gabriel and keyboardist Martin Orford's grandiose keyboarding. However, guitarist Mike Holmes' role was far more assertive in the band, giving them a harder edge musically. After Nicholls' departure, the band's style became increasingly commercial and radio-friendly \u2014 albeit without much success \u2014 on Nomzamo (1987) and Are You Sitting Comfortably? (1989), although each album still featured some progressive rock-style tracks. Beginning with Nicholls's return on 1993's Ever, the band returned to its prog rock roots, with longer tracks featuring intricate arrangements and complex musicianship.", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead and backing vocals (1981\u20131985, 1990\u2013present)", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead vocals", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead vocals", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead vocals", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead vocals", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead vocals", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead vocals", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead vocals", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead vocals", "* Peter Nicholls \u2013 vocals", "  bar:pn text:\"Peter Nicholls\""]}, {"page": "Peter Nicholls", "response": ["Peter Nicholls may refer to:", "*Peter Nicholls (artist) (1936\u20132021), New Zealand sculptor", "*Peter Nicholls (writer) (1939\u20132018), Australian literary scholar and critic", "*Peter Nicholls (musician) (born 1959), British musician"]}, {"page": "Nicholls (name)", "response": ["* Peter Nicholls (musician) (born 1959), English singer", "* Peter Nicholls (writer) (1939\u20132018), Australian literary scholar and critic"]}, {"page": "Subterranea (album)", "response": ["All music by IQ, all lyrics by Peter Nicholls.", "*Peter Nicholls \u2013 lead and backing vocals"]}, {"page": "The Wake (IQ album)", "response": ["The cover art was designed by lead singer Peter Nicholls.
