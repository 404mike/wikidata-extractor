There are two lakes created by dams, which were once fish ponds.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1900 To the north of the second lake is Fountain Dale moat, which is known to have existed in 1251, when there was a hunting lodge on the  island, from which tolls were collected by the forester Raffe Clerc. There is a  wide causeway across the north-eastern corner of the moat, which is around  wide, with a substantial bank beyond that. The site has not been disturbed since it was abandoned, and so is better preserved than many residential moated sites in Britain. To the south of the lake is the Grade II listed Fountain Dale House, dating from the mid-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At the outlet of the lake is a Grade II listed well head constructed of ashlar and red brick, called Friar Tuck's well, after which the river turns to the north-east to reach another artificial lake called Cave Pond. Passing under Blidworth Lane on the outskirts of Rainworth, it enters an 'L'-shaped lake, called \"L Lake\", the other branch of which is fed by Foulevil Brook.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map The main lake covers an area of  and is a private fishery, stocked with bream, carp, pike, roach and tench. It forms part of the Rainworth Lakes Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which covers an area of  and has been designated because of the variety of plant species which grow in the open water and adjacent marsh. The naturalist Joseph Whitaker lived by the lakes at Rainworth Lodge. The river passes through the centre of Rainworth village, under the B6020 and the A617 Rainworth bypass. Rainworth Sewage Treatment Works is located on its north-east bank, as is the Rainworth Water local nature reserve, after which it is culverted to pass under a railway embankment associated with Rufford Colliery.
