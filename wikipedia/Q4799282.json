He was born in Caskieben (later renamed Keithhall) near Inverurie in Aberdeenshire.  His father, Sir George Johnston, was an Aberdeenshire laird, and his mother Christian Forbes was the daughter of Lord Forbes.\nJohnston is thought to have begun his university studies at one, or both, of the colleges at the University of Aberdeen, but around 1608 he went to Italy and received an M.D. at Padua in 1610. Afterwards he lived at Sedan, France as professor at the Academy of Sedan, in the company of the exiled Andrew Melville, and in 1619 was in practice in Paris. He appears to have returned to Scotland about the time of James VI's death in 1625, and to have been in Aberdeen in about 1628. He met William Laud in Edinburgh at the time of Charles I's Scottish coronation (1633).  In that year, he had published a volume entitled Cantici Salomonis paraphrasis poetica, which, dedicated to Charles I, brought him to Laud's notice.\nJohnston was encouraged by Laud in his literary efforts, possibly as a strike against George Buchanan's reputation as a Latin poet. Johnston was appointed rector of King's College, Aberdeen, in June 1637. Four years later he died at Oxford, on his way to London at Laud's invitation.\nJohnston left more than ten works, all in Latin. Only two of these, published in the same year, are notable: (a) his version of the Psalms (Psalmorum Davidis paraphrasis poetica et canticorum evangelicorum, Aberdeen, 1637), and (b) his anthology of contemporary Latin verse by Scottish poets (Deliciae poetarum Scotorum huius aevi illustrium, Amsterdam, 1637).\nThe full version of the Psalms was the result of Laud's encouragement. It was for some time a strong rival of Buchanan's work, though not superior to the latter. The Deliciae, in two small thick volumes of 699 and 575 pages, was a patriotic effort in imitation of the various volumes (under a similar title) which had been popular on the Continent during the second decade of the century. The volumes are dedicated by Johnston to John Scot of Scotstarvet, at whose expense the collected works were published after Johnston's death, at Middelburg (1642). Selections from his own poems occupy pages 439-647 of the first volume, divided into three sections, Parerga, Epigrammata and Musae Aulicae.\nHe published a volume of epigrams at Aberdeen in 1632. In these pieces he shows himself at his best. His sacred poems, which had appeared in the Opera (1642), were reprinted by Lauder in his Poetarum Scotorum musae sacrae (1739). The earliest lives are by Lauder and Benson (in Psalmi Davidici, 1741). Ruddiman's Vindication of Mr George Buchanan's Paraphrase (1745) began a pamphlet controversy regarding the merits of the rival poets.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1641", "response": ["* Arthur Johnston, Scottish physician and poet (b. c. 1579)"]}, {"page": "1579", "response": ["** Arthur Johnston, Scottish physician and poet (d. 1641)"]}, {"page": "1641 in literature", "response": ["*July 15 \u2013 Arthur Johnston, Scottish poet and physician (born c. 1579)"]}, {"page": "1608 in literature", "response": ["**Scottish poet Arthur Johnston goes to Italy to study medicine at Padua."]}, {"page": "1579 in literature", "response": ["**Arthur Johnston, Scottish poet and physician (died 1641)"]}, {"page": "Scottish literature", "response": ["The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum (1637), published in Amsterdam by Arthur Johnston (c. 1579\u20131641) and Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet (1585\u20131670) and containing work by the major Scottish practitioners since Buchanan.

There are three classes of dunce. First, there are the naturally dull. These are drawn to her as bees are to a queen bee, and they \"adhere\" to her person. The second are the people who do not wish to be dunces but are, \"Whate'er of mungril no one class admits,/ A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits\" (B IV 89\u201390). These dunces orbit Dulness. They struggle to break free, and they get some distance from her, but they are too weak to flee. The third class are \"[...] false to Phoebus, bow to Baal;/ Or impious, preach his Word without a call\" (B IV 93\u201394). They are men and women who do dull things by supporting dunces, either by giving money to hacks or by suppressing the cause of worthy writers. These people come to Dulness as a comet does:  although they are only occasionally near her, they habitually do her bidding.  Of this last group, Pope classes Sir Thomas Hanmer, a \"decent knight,\" who absurdly thinks himself a great Shakespeare editor and uses his own money to publish an exceptionally lavish and ornate edition (with a text that was based on Pope's own edition). He is outshone in darkness by one Benson, who is even more absurd, in that he begins putting up monuments of John Milton, striking coins and medals of Milton, and translating Milton's Latin poetry and who had then passed from excessive Milton fanaticism to fanaticism for Arthur Johnston, a Scottish physician and Latin poet. Unable to be the most fantastically vain man, Hamner prepares to withdraw his edition, but \"Apollo's May'r and Aldermen\" (B IV 116) take the page from him. (This was a reference to Oxford University Press, with which Pope had a quarrel based on their denying Bishop Warburton a doctorate in 1741). Dulness tells her followers to imitate Benson and tack their own names to statues and editions of famous authors, to treat standard authors as trophies (the busts made of them like hunting trophies), and thus \"So by each Bard an Alderman shall sit\" (B IV 131)."]}, {"page": "1608 in poetry", "response": ["* Scottish poet Arthur Johnston goes to Italy to study medicine at Padua."]}, {"page": "Arthur Johnston (lyricist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Johnston (poet)"]}, {"page": "1579 in poetry", "response": ["* Arthur Johnston (died 1641), Scottish poet and physician"]}, {"page": "John Scot, Lord Scotstarvit", "response": ["Scott's intimacy with Joan Blaeu of Amsterdam led to the inclusion of a Scottish volume in the series of Deliti\u00e6 Poetarum then being issued by that enterprising publisher.
