She became orphaned after her parents died of smallpox. She has become alone on the streets knowing nobody, and with nowhere to go. She stumbles upon her friend Esther Davies (Emma Stansfield) while at her parents grave, who brings her to join a group of \"working girls\" under the madam, Mrs. Brown. Fanny naively accepts. When she arrives, she meets Phoebe (Carli Norris) with whom she experiences her first sexual encounter and where she discovered her interest in being a woman of pleasure. Fanny soon discovers she has her first client, Mr. Croft (Philip Jackson), who she expected to be young, handsome and rich. Upon meeting him, she discovered that he was rich, but she also found he was old, repulsive, and forcing himself onto her virtue. To no avail, Mr. Croft left in a storm of dust, demanding his money back.
