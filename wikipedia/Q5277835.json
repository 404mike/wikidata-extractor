It was a cover version of the Barbra Streisand hit. \"Woman in Love\" was essentially a ballad with hip hop and R&B undertones. The track did not sell well, entering the charts at number 64 and disappearing from the chart the following week. Ryan did have an album in the pipeline and said to be forthcoming in the media around the time of this single's release. It was due for release in mid-1997 However, it was decided not to release it, due to Ryan's previous two singles failing to emulate the success of her debut. It is known that (as well as the three singles), the following tracks were recorded for this album: \"Fallen\" (produced by Steve Anderson of Brothers in Rhythm (who has actually seemingly himself posted the track on YouTube, to enthusiastic praise from viewers); \"Swept Away\" (a mid-tempo love song), \"The Feeling Is Right Now\" (produced, like \"Fallen\", by Steve Anderson, and written by Lulu), and \"Nothing in This World\", written by none other than Burt Bacharach and 1990s pop-R&B luminary Nigel Lowis (who worked extensively with Eternal, Dina Carroll and Michelle Gayle). These three tracks remain virtually unheard and totally unreleased. Additionally, on the B-Side to \"You Lift Me Up\" was a cover of \"Have I Told You Lately\", which may or may not have appeared on Ryan's LP. Another track, \"Just Can't Learn To Say Goodbye\", from this album, appears on the music website SoundCloud."]}]}}
