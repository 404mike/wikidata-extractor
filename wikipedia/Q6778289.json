Early in his career, Bartley played for English non-league clubs Burnham, Hayes, Didcot Town and Hampton & Richmond Borough. He broke into the professional leagues in 2007 with AFC Bournemouth, where he made over 100 Football League appearances. Soon after Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe moved to Burnley in 2011, Bartley followed Howe to Turf Moor.\nBartley fell out of favour at Burnley after Howe returned to Bournemouth in October 2012. He initially moved on loan to Leyton Orient, then joined Orient on a permanent basis after he was released by Burnley in January 2014. Bartley left Orient in the summer of 2015 and signed for Scottish club Hibernian. He helped Hibernian win the Scottish Cup in 2016 and promotion in 2017. After his contract with Hibernian expired in May 2019, Bartley signed for Livingston.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Livingston F.C.", "response": ["|Assistant Manager|| Marvin Bartley"]}, {"page": "Romain Vincelot", "response": ["On 15 July 2011, Vincelot signed for newly promoted Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee estimated as \u00a3100,000.

On 26 November, he scored his only goal of 20 appearances for the Seagulls, the winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Coventry City at the Falmer Stadium. He was sent off after six minutes of a 1\u20130 loss at home to Burnley on 17 December for fighting Marvin Bartley, with teammate Ashley Barnes joining him six minutes later."]}, {"page": "Keith Treacy", "response": ["He scored on his debut for the club, coming on as a substitute on the 65th minute against Watford, in a 2\u20132 draw at Turf Moor. After scoring on his debut, Manager Eddie Howe praised Treacy's performance.  His second later came on 17 September 2011, in a 2\u20131 loss against Peterborough United. Unfortunately, Treacy suffered a hamstring injury in training that kept him out for two weeks. It wasn't until on 1 October 2001 when he made his return against Millwall, coming on as a substitute for Marvin Bartley in a 1\u20130 loss. Since joining Burnley, Treacy became a first team regular for Burnley, playing in the midfield position. He then provided a double assist on 29 November 2011, in a 4\u20130 win over Ipswich Town. However, Treacy's form and fitness began to falter, resulting him not being in the starting line-up, prompting Manager Howe insisted Treacy remained at the club throughout the transfer window. By the time he was loaned out to Sheffield Wednesday, Treacy went on to make twenty\u2013seven appearances and scoring two times for Burnley at the end of the 2011\u201312 season."]}, {"page": "Marvin (name)", "response": ["*Marvin Bartley (born 1986), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Joe Partington", "response": ["Born in Portsmouth, Partington joined AFC Bournemouth in June 2006 after being released by Portsmouth.
