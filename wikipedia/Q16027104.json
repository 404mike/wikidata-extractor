An amateur, Poyntz was an aggressive right-handed batsman. He generally played as part of the middle order, and though his batting was not exceptional, he was highly praised for his fielding ability. He captained Somerset in the two years prior to the First World War.\nThe youngest son of the Chief Constable of Essex, Poyntz made his county cricket debut in 1905, hitting a half-century to help Somerset win their only match of that season. He achieved his best batting average in that year, while each of the following four were of little note. In 1910 he captained Somerset for the first time, and scored over 300 runs in a season for the second of five occasions. His only attempts at bowling occurred during 1911, when he claimed eight wickets at an average of almost forty. He was named as Somerset's official captain in 1913, and remained in charge for the following season. After serving in the Army during the First World War, Poyntz scored his only century in first-class cricket in a match for the Army against Cambridge University in 1919. He played two further matches for Somerset that year, after which he did not appear in first-class cricket again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset cricket captains", "response": ["Between 1894 and 1946, the club captaincy remained reasonably stable, six official captains spanned the 52-year period.  In addition to Woods, John Daniell, Jack White and Reggie Ingle all captained the side on more than 150 occasions, and Lionel Palairet led the team for one season and Massey Poyntz for two.  Bunty Longrigg was captain of the side either side of the Second World War, totalling 73 matches.  In contrast, the following nine years saw the club utilise eight different official captains, and a number more unofficial ones.  Jack Meyer, who went on to found Millfield, stood down at the end of 1947, his first season as captain.  In 1948, the club committee claimed that it was unable to find anyone of suitable pedigree to lead the side for the whole summer, and was forced to name three captains for the season.  Mandy Mitchell-Innes led the side throughout the pre-season and for the first five matches of the County Championship during leave from the Sudan Political Service. The captaincy then passed onto Jake Seamer, also on leave from the Sudan Political Service, for seven matches, before the committee settled on George Woodhouse, who remained in the position for the following 1949 season.Foot (1986), pp155\u2013156. The next three captains \u2013 Stuart Rogers, Ben Brocklehurst and Gerry Tordoff \u2013 all captained the side for three seasons or less, and in the words of cricket writer and Somerset County Cricket Club historian David Foot, \"captaincy had, ever since the war... been a matter of recurrent concern.\"Foot (1986), p169. This concern, and the fact that there was a lack of amateurs with the necessary time and money to dedicate to the role, meant that in 1956 the club appointed Maurice Tremlett to the role, the county's first professional captain."]}, {"page": "Poyntz", "response": ["*Massey Poyntz (1883\u20131934), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Massey Poyntz (1905\u20131919) 102 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Hugh Poyntz", "response": ["Poyntz was the sixth child and second son of a military family.
