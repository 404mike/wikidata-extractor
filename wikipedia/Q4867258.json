He has a habit of mispronouncing words and using descriptive language instead of simple phrases when speaking. This character is somewhat similar to the actor Basil Soper, who appeared in real advertisements on British television for the Personal Injury Helpline. The character appeared as a panelist on the comedy panel show Shooting Stars on 29 August 2011. Serafinowicz said in 2012 that a feature film was currently in development based around Brian Butterfield's investigator agency.  On 7 January 2013, he featured in his own sketch in the CBBC comedy program Fit."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2013", "response": ["*Basil Soper, British actor, 74\u201375."]}]}}
