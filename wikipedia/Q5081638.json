In 1946 he replaced O G S Crawford as the Archaeology Officer of the Ordnance Survey. He was awarded the Victoria Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1967 for his contributions to the topography and mapping of Early Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sutton Hoo", "response": ["=== Basil Brown and Charles Phillips: 1938\u20131939 ===", "thumb|A so-called 'ghostly' image of the buried ship was revealed during excavations in 1939. The 'ghost' effect was the result of sand discoloured by the organic matter which had rotted away. Still from a film made by H. J.

He was taken to Sutton Hoo by Mr Maynard, the Ipswich Museum curator, and was staggered by what he saw. Within a short time, following discussions with the Ipswich Museum, the British Museum, the Science Museum, and Office of Works, Phillips had taken over responsibility for the excavation of the burial chamber. Initially, Phillips and the British Museum instructed Brown to cease excavating until they could get their team assembled, but he continued working, something which may have saved the site from being looted by treasure hunters. Phillips' team included W.F. Grimes and O.G.S. Crawford of the Ordnance Survey, Peggy Piggott (later known as Margaret Guido) and Stuart Piggott, and other friends and colleagues.See Charles Phillips's diary of the excavation (Carver Sutton Hoo, pp. 11\u201320) Extensive photography of the ship excavation was made by Mercie Lack and Barbara Wagstaff."]}, {"page": "Skegness", "response": ["There is evidence of late Iron-Age and early Roman saltmaking activity in the Skegness area.Owen and Coates (2003), p. 43. Kime (1986), p. 13 says local salt-making began in the Bronze Age. For further discussion about this industry, see Lane and Morris (2001). Place names and a report of a castle in the medieval settlement have been interpreted as evidence that a Roman fort existed in the town before being lost to the sea in the late Middle Ages.Owen and Coates (2003), p. 43. The archaeologist Charles Phillips suggested that Skegness was the terminus of a Roman road running from Lincoln through Burgh le Marsh and was also the location of a Roman ferry which crossed The Wash to Norfolk.Owen and Coates (2003), pp. 42\u201343. If the Roman fortifications indeed existed, it is likely that the Anglo-Saxons used them as a coastal shore fort. Later, the Vikings settled in Lincolnshire and their influence is detected in many local place names.Kime (1986), p. 13. Skegness's name combines the Old Norse words Skeggi and ness, and means either \"Skeggi's headland\" or \"beard-shaped headland\";Cameron and Ingsley (1998), p. 110. Skeggi (meaning \"bearded one\") may be the name of a Viking settler or it could derive from the Old Norse word skegg \"beard\" and have been used to describe the shape of the landform.Mills (2011) gives both possibilities. Skegness was not named in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is usually identified with the Domesday settlement called Tric.Owen and Coates (2003), p. 42. The historian Arthur Owen and the linguist Richard Coates have argued that Tric derived its name from Traiectus, Latin for \"crossing\", referring to the Roman ferry that Phillips argues launched from Skegness.Owen and Coates (2003), pp. 42\u201344.

Still without any formal archaeological qualification, Piggott enrolled at Mortimer Wheeler's Institute of Archaeology, London, taking his diploma in 1936. It was also here that he met his wife, Peggy (Margaret Guido). In 1937 he published another seminal paper, \"The early Bronze Age in Wessex\", and with his wife went on in June 1939 to join the burial chamber excavations at Sutton Hoo at the invitation of Charles Phillips."]}, {"page": "Ken Stott", "response": ["| 2021 || The Dig || Charles Phillips || "]}, {"page": "Ipswich Museum", "response": ["Frank Woolnough was succeeded by Guy Maynard (1877\u20131966), previously of Saffron Walden Museum, who was curator from 1920 to 1953.

The Museum was approached to release Brown for part of 1938 and 1939 to investigate the Sutton Hoo mounds for Mrs Pretty, under the museum's guidance.
