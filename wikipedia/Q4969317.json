In 1925, he retired from teaching but continued composing and was awarded the first honorary doctorate to be given by Masaryk University in Brno. In the spring of 1926, he created his Sinfonietta, a monumental orchestral work, which rapidly gained wide critical acclaim. In the same year, he went to England at the invitation of Rosa Newmarch. A number of his works were performed in London, including his first string quartet, the wind sextet Youth, and his violin sonata.Drl\u00edkov\u00e1 (2004), p. 109 Shortly after, and still in 1926, he started to compose a setting to an Old Church Slavonic text.

Before then, on 5 January 1866, The Brandenburgers had been performed to an enthusiastic reception at the Provisional Theatre\u2014over strong opposition from Ma\u00fdr, who had refused to rehearse or conduct the piece. The idiom was too advanced for Ma\u00fdr's liking, and the opera was eventually staged under the composer's own direction. \"I was called on stage nine times,\" Smetana wrote, recording that the house was sold out and that the critics were full of praise.Large, p. 145 Music historian Rosa Newmarch believes that, although The Brandenburgers has not stood the test of time, it contains all the germs of Smetana's operatic art.Newmarch, p. 64", "Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848,Large, p. 46 Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853.

Among others, he amended the orchestrations of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Brahms. For example, Stokowski revised the ending of the Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture, by Tchaikovsky, so it would close quietly, taking his notion from Modest Tchaikovsky's Life and Letters of Peter Ilych Tchaikovsky (translated by Rosa Newmarch: 1906) that the composer had provided a quiet ending of his own at Balakirev's suggestion. Stokowski made his own orchestration of Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain by adapting Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestration and making it sound, in some places, similar to Mussorgsky's original. In the film Fantasia, to conform to the Disney artists' story-line, depicting the battle between good and evil, the ending of Night on Bald Mountain segued into the beginning of Schubert's Ave Maria."]}, {"page": "1857 in music", "response": ["*December 18 \u2013 Rosa Newmarch, n\u00e9e Jeaffreson, English musicologist (died 1940)"]}, {"page": "Ivan Aivazovsky", "response": ["During his 60-year career, Aivazovsky produced around 6,000 paintings of, what one online art magazine describes, \"very different value\u00a0... there are masterpieces and there are very timid works\".
