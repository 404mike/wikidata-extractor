He published several significant scientific papers on enzymes. Part of his work on enzymes was done with J. B. S. Haldane, and led to the derivation of Victor Henri's enzyme kinetics law and Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics via the steady state approximation. This derivation remains commonly used today because it provides better insight into the system, though it re1etains the algebraic form of the Michaelis-Menten equations.\nNotable publications of Briggs include Movement of Water in Plants.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Regius Professor of Botany (Cambridge)", "response": ["* George Edward Briggs (1948)"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Botanic Garden", "response": ["The planning of the new Garden was carried out by Professor Henslow, assisted by young Cardale Babington. The land was flat and unpromising as a garden site, but the layout was planned with great skill, utilizing an old gravel pit to construct a lake with a high mound running into it. Trees and shrubs were planted according to their botanical sequence, a range of glasshouses was built in the 1860s, and a rock garden, one of the earliest of its kind in the country, was constructed about the same time. The Garden has also long been known for its many fine specimens of rare trees. By the 1870s the main features of the Garden had been developed and, it was ready to play its part in the great expansion of botanical teaching and research that was about to take place at Cambridge. During the early years of the 20th century much of the pioneer work of William Bateson, Charles Chamberlain Hurst, and Edith Rebecca Saunders on plant genetics was carried out at the Garden, and it was later used for researches on plant physiology by Frederick Blackman and George Edward Briggs, and on plant pathology by Frederick Tom Brooks and others."]}, {"page": "Oasis Academy Wintringham", "response": ["* Prof George Edward Briggs, Professor of Botany at the University of Cambridge from 1948 to 1960"]}, {"page": "George Briggs", "response": ["* George Edward Briggs (1893\u20131985), British botanist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| George Edward Briggs||16/05/1935||25 June 1893 \u2013 7 February 1985"]}, {"page": "Spontaneous recovery", "response": ["Spontaneous recovery as it pertains to human memory can be traced back to the work of George Edward Briggs, who was concerned with the concept of retroactive interference. Inhibition, or interference, is a function of competition among responses, whereby a resultant memory has dominance over another.  It is not that the inhibited responses are lost from memory per se, but that they are kept by other responses from appearing."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1935", "response": ["*George Edward Briggs"]}]}}
