He published several significant scientific papers on enzymes. Part of his work on enzymes was done with J. B. S. Haldane, and led to the derivation of Victor Henri's enzyme kinetics law and Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics via the steady state approximation. This derivation remains commonly used today because it provides better insight into the system, though it re1etains the algebraic form of the Michaelis-Menten equations.\nNotable publications of Briggs include Movement of Water in Plants.", "link_mentions": {}}}
