Thus if the Barony of Stanley of Alderley were created today, it would be created as Baron Stanley of Alderley, of Alderley in the County of Chester. This dual usage of the same term in the title and in the territorial designation may appear peculiar, but is a regular occurrence, with one recent example being Adair Turner, who was (in 2005) created Baron Turner of Ecchinswell, of Ecchinswell in the County of Hampshire. Though this dual usage (or repetition) in both title and territorial designation is not a requirement to create a title in the form of \"Baron Surname of Place\" as illustrated in the example of Gerry Grimstone who was created (in 2020) as Baron Grimstone of Boscobel, of Belgravia in the City of Westminster."]}, {"page": "Gerry Grimstone", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerry Grimstone, Baron Grimstone of Boscobel"]}, {"page": "Baron Grimstone of Boscobel", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerry Grimstone, Baron Grimstone of Boscobel"]}, {"page": "Lord Grimstone of Boscobel", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerry Grimstone, Baron Grimstone of Boscobel"]}, {"page": "Lord Grimstone", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerry Grimstone, Baron Grimstone of Boscobel"]}]}}
