The friend Lowry referred to was businessman Monty Bloom, to whom he also explained his obsession with Rossetti's portraits: \"They are not real women.[...] They are dreams.[...] He used them for something in his mind caused by the death of his wife.

He attended the Bishop Gore School and then the Swansea School of Art and Crafts (now part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David). At the age of 16 he exhibited at the 1928 National Eisteddfod (held in Treorchy that year). Three years later, while he was still concentrating on still lifes and portraits, he was commissioned to paint a portrait of the mayor of Swansea, Arthur Lovell. In 1931 he painted a portrait of a 17-year-old Mervyn Levy, thought to have been the painting that won him a scholarship to study art at the Royal Academy Schools in London. At the Royal Academy Schools his drawing tutors included Tom Monnington, but he was also stimulated by the modernist works displayed in the commercial galleries of nearby Cork Street, and he did not complete his Academy course. While in London, he shared several flats in and around Chelsea with contemporaries; at first with William Scott, the Scots-Irish artist whom Janes met at the Royal Academy Schools.", "In 1932 Janes became part of a group of bohemian Swansea friends that included poets Dylan Thomas, Charles Fisher, John Prichard and Vernon Watkins, composer Daniel Jones, artist Mervyn Levy and \"Marxist scholar\" Bert Trick. Collectively, they became known as The Kardomah Gang or The Kardomah Boys, named after the Kardomah Caf\u00e9, in Castle Street, Swansea, where they met. The Caf\u00e9 stood opposite the offices of the South Wales Daily Post, to which Fisher and Thomas were apprenticed in 1930, after they had left school."]}, {"page": "MOMA, Wales", "response": ["Paintings and drawings from the Tabernacle Collection are shown in rotation.
