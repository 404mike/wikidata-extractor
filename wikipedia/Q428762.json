He was Clarenceux King of Arms, the second most senior member of the College of Arms and the second most senior heraldic position in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and several other Commonwealth countries. His other appointments included those of Registrar of the College of Arms, Secretary of the Order of the Garter, and Honorary Genealogist to the Royal Victorian Order. Chesshyre undertook heraldic and genealogical work for high-profile clients such as the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath. He wrote seven books, including the official history of the Order of the Garter.\nIn October 2015, a jury sitting at Snaresbrook Crown Court found by a unanimous verdict that Chesshyre had committed child sexual abuse offences in the 1990s. He was found to be unfit to plead, and his trial was therefore a trial of the facts. This means that no formal conviction is recorded and Chesshyre was therefore given an absolute discharge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 22", "response": ["*  1940   \u2013 Hubert Chesshyre, English historian and author (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "Christ Church, Oxford", "response": ["In other fields, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twins associated with the founding of Facebook, King Edward VII (1841\u20131910), King of the United Kingdom and Emperor of India, King William II of the Netherlands, entrepreneur and founder of Pennsylvania William Penn, broadcaster David Dimbleby, MP Louise Mensch, BBC composer Howard Goodall, actor Riz Ahmed, the writer Lewis Carroll, poet W.\u00a0H.

In 2015, a trial of the facts had reached the verdict that Chesshyre had committed child sexual abuse offences, leading to a recommendation from the Honours Committee that he be stripped of honours. The council issued a statement saying that it \"regrets that a majority of those present [at the vote] did not see fit to support the resolution\" and that the incident showed \"need to modernise the society\u2019s statutes and governance procedures\". In 2020, following David Starkey's comments on slavery and genocide, the society announced that they were modernising their procedures for dealing with behaviour which runs contrary to their values: Starkey subsequently resigned his fellowship."]}, {"page": "Clarenceux King of Arms", "response": ["!Hubert Chesshyre"]}, {"page": "Blacktown City Council", "response": ["After becoming a city in 1979, the Council resolved to investigate and if possible obtain a coat of arms, making a request to the Chester Herald of Arms, Hubert Chesshyre.

Exceptionally, however, a court occasionally grants an absolute discharge for a very serious offence when presented with extenuating circumstances (the signalman in the Thirsk rail crash, who was found guilty of manslaughter, is an example). That usually signifies that while a crime may technically have been committed, the imposition of any punishment would, in the opinion of the judge or magistrates, be inappropriate. In 2015, Hubert Chesshyre was found to have sexually abused a choirboy, but a stroke and the onset of dementia made the court find that he was deemed unfit to plead and he was granted an absolute discharge. An initial request in 2015 to have Chesshyre stripped of his honours was denied. In 2018, after an appeal to the victim's Member of Parliament he was stripped of most of his honours and a review into the honours system has been called for."]}, {"page": "Norroy and Ulster King of Arms", "response": ["!Hubert Chesshyre"]}, {"page": "John Brooke-Little", "response": ["In 1952\u20133, Brooke-Little served on the staff assembled by the Earl Marshal to plan the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

It was his abiding interest in heraldry that led to this appointment, and this work with the Earl Marshal and the officers of arms led to his first heraldic appointment. He joined the College of Arms as Bluemantle Pursuivant in 1956. The rank of pursuivant is the junior of the three levels an officer of arms can attain, and Brooke-Little related the story of his appointment in an editorial. In 1956, Sir George Bellew, the Garter King of Arms, had recommended Brooke-Little and Colin Cole for the open position of Bluemantle. The two were asked to meet with the Earl Marshal in London. The Earl Marshal was not usually faced with two candidates for an opening; he offered the position to Cole, who turned it down as his wife was expecting a child. Brooke-Little was made Bluemantle. Several months later when Sir Gerald Wollaston died, in the ensuing shuffle Cole was finally given his appointment as Portcullis Pursuivant.John Brooke-Little. \"Editorial.\" The Coat of Arms.
