He noticed on the British landscape an apparent arrangement of straight lines positioned along ancient features. For these he subsequently coined the term \"ley\", now usually referred to as ley line, because the line passed through places whose names contained the syllable \"ley\".\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
