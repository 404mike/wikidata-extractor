Her husband (Abraham Ross) survived the robbery, and he reported that the robbers had addressed each other as \"Pat\" and \"Jim\". Police suspected two known criminals, Meehan and James Griffiths, who had been in the area. Griffiths panicked when the police tried to arrest him, and he went on a gun-toting rampage across Glasgow. He was shot dead by police, but only after he shot and injured several passers-by, one of whom later died. Meehan was arrested more peacefully and charged with the murder of Mrs. Ross. His solicitor was Joseph Beltrami, and his advocates were Nicholas Fairbairn and John Smith, who both later became high-ranking politicians."]}, {"page": "List of British Italians", "response": ["* Joseph Beltrami"]}, {"page": "1932 in Scotland", "response": ["* 15 May \u2013 Joseph Beltrami, defence lawyer (died 2015)"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Joseph Beltrami, 83, lawyer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2015", "response": ["*Joseph Beltrami, 83, British lawyer.Legendary Scots criminal lawyer Joe Beltrami dies, aged 83"]}, {"page": "Joe Beltrami", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Beltrami"]}, {"page": "Beltrami (surname)", "response": ["*Joseph Beltrami (1932-2015), Scottish lawyer"]}, {"page": "Beltrami, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Beltrami"]}]}}
