The producer used the Echoplex for echo effects and the Roland Space Echo for reverberation techniques. Throughout the album, he also uses samples of television dialogue, including from English actors James Robertson Justice and Leslie Phillips and the sitcom Doctor on the Go, which he achieved by holding a microphone to the television. Steve Barrow writes that the sitcom samples exemplify Perry being \"keen on the odd musical metaphor,\" while The Wire write that the dialogue snipppets represented the zenith of Perry's ongoing \"pastiching of mainstream culture.\""]}, {"page": "David Costa (graphic designer)", "response": ["| Philip Dodd/The Rolling Stones", "| Philip Dodd"]}, {"page": "Philip Dodd (broadcaster)", "response": ["Philip Dodd (born 1949) is an English broadcaster, entrepreneur, curator, writer and editor.
