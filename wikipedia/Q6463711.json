Although her poetry hits hard in addressing contemporary themes, it often makes use of formal constraints, including traditional poetic forms. She has described herself as \"bicultural\" and bisexual. Issues of racial and gender identity feature in her poetry. She is celebrated \"for paying equal homage to literature and performance\" and for work that \"moves fluidly and nimbly between cultures, dialects, voices; between page and stage.\" In 2017 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Patience Agbabi (born 1965, W/E)"]}, {"page": "1965 in literature", "response": ["**Patience Agbabi, British performance poet"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Patience Agbabi"]}, {"page": "Next Generation poets (2004)", "response": ["*Patience Agbabi"]}, {"page": "Black British people", "response": ["Jackie Kay, since 2016, has been Scots Makar, the national poet laureate of Scotland, poets Roger Robinson (won the prestigious T.
