The results are mixed. 'Sledgehammer', echoing both Stevie Wonder's 'Superstition' and David Bowie's 'Fame', retains its punch. Elsewhere, Gabriel sounds airbrushed on 'Mercy Street', 'Red Rain' and 'In Your Eyes', with only 'We Do What We're Told' a reminder of a daring past.\" Writing in Uncut, John Lewis also directed criticism at the album. He praised its state-of-the-art production in parts, highlighting \"Big Time\" and \"Sledgehammer\" as standout tracks, but stated elsewhere it interfered, such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer on \"That Voice Again\" and whistling ambient accompaniment on \"Mercy Street\"."]}, {"page": "Harry Gregson-Williams", "response": ["| The Forbidden Kingdom || Rob Minkoff || LionsgateRelativity MediaCasey Silver ProductionsHuayi Brothers || Score producerScore composed by David Buckley", "| Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time || Mike Newell || Jerry Bruckheimer FilmsWalt Disney Pictures || Additional music by Halli Cauthery and David BuckleyAs composer and conductor", "| The Town || Ben Affleck || GK FilmsLegendary PicturesWarner Bros.

Given its downbeat, \"almost dirge-like\" nature, spoken word verses, \"Dylanesque vocal delivery\" and funereal pace, it was considered an unusual and brave choice as it, says Buckley, \"it was largely inappropriate for hit radio\". According to British chart watcher James Masterton in his column for Dotmusic, the single followed R.E.M.'s typical \"marketing habit of issuing one of the most uncommercial tracks from the album as the lead single.
