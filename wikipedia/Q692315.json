He was typically late to public events, and would sometimes fail to arrive. Although Bianco thought he had a \"gift for oratory\", he was considered a poor orator by Blundy and Lycett. The biographer Daniel Kawczynski noted that Gaddafi was famed for his \"lengthy, wandering\" speeches, which typically involved criticizing Israel and the US.
