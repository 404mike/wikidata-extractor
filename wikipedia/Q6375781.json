Since training as a professional musician at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, she has performed her cabaret style sets at the Edinburgh Fringe, as well as the Hackney Vortex Club, the King's Head Islington, Jermyn Street Theatre and the Covent Garden Festival Club. She won Performer of the Year award at the London Palladium. Her show has been described as consisting of \"unique happenings at the cello and intimate confessions at the piano\" and as \"a cross between Victoria Wood and Jim Tavar\u00e9\".\nShe has also worked as part of Last Amendment (formerly Crass Agenda).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crass", "response": ["In November 2002 several former members arranged Your Country Needs You, a concert of \"voices in opposition to war\", as the Crass Collective. At Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's South Bank, Your Country Needs You included Benjamin Britten's War Requiem and performances by Goldblade, Fun-Da-Mental, Ian MacKaye and Pete Wright's post-Crass project, Judas 2. In October 2003 the Crass Collective changed their name to Crass Agenda, with Rimbaud, Libertine and Vaucher working with Matt Black of Coldcut and jazz musicians such as Julian Siegel and Kate Shortt. In 2004 Crass Agenda spearheaded a campaign to save the Vortex Jazz Club in Stoke Newington, north London (where they regularly played). In June 2005 Crass Agenda was declared to be \"no more\", changing its name to the \"more pertinent\" Last Amendment. After a five-year hiatus, Last Amendment performed at the Vortex in June 2012. Rimbaud has also performed and recorded with Japanther and the Charlatans. A \"new\" Crass track (a remix of 1982's \"Major General Despair\" with new lyrics), \"The Unelected President\", is available."]}, {"page": "Orphy Robinson", "response": ["* Kate Shortt, Something to Tell You (2006)"]}, {"page": "Shortt", "response": ["*Kate Shortt, British pianist, cello player, songwriter."]}, {"page": "Kate Shortt (musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kate Shortt"]}]}}
