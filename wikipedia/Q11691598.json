Officer Crabtree was played as an hopeless British undercover officer, disguised constantly as a French local policeman during the Second World War. Much of the character's humour derived from his supposed inability to pronounce French words correctly in conversation, which, on an English-language television programme, was represented by ludicrous exaggeration and mispronunciation of ordinary English words. For example, \"Good morning\" would be pronounced as \"Good moaning\", \"I was just passing round the corner\" would be \"I was just pissing roond the corner\", and famously, \"The bombers were being chased by fighters when they dropped their bombs on the London docks\" became \"The bummers were being chased by farters when they drooped their bums on the London dicks'. Bostrom actually speaks fluent French. Prior to this he appeared in Stephen Fry & Hugh Laurie's  1983 sketch show pilot 'The Crystal Cube' which was not commissioned for a series. ", "In 2005, Bostrom guest-starred in Dead Man Walking, an audio drama based on the television series Sapphire and Steel. From December 2007 to January 2008, he continued his pantomime run when he appeared in a production as an ugly sister in Cinderella in Middlesbrough. On 8 January 2008, he appeared in an episode of Big Brother's Big Mouth on E4. He discussed events in the house after introducing the show in the familiar character of Officer Crabtree.", "In October 2018 he reprised his role from 'Allo 'Allo! in the book Good Moaning France: Officer Crabtree's Fronch Phrose Berk, in which he attempts to teach others to 'spook the Fronch longwodge'."]}, {"page": "'Allo 'Allo!
