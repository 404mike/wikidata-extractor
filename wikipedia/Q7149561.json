After several years of steady improvement, Leyton Orient gained promotion in the 2005\u201306 season, finishing in third place and gaining automatic promotion to League One. This was the club's first automatic promotion in 36\u00a0years and ended a period of 11 years in the English league's bottom division. This promotion season also saw an excellent FA Cup run, with Leyton Orient progressing to the fourth round after beating Premiership side Fulham. Promotion was only secured in the final minutes of the final game of the season, away at Oxford United; with the score tied at 2\u20132 and Orient seemingly destined to miss out yet again, news came through of a late goal scored against promotion rivals Grimsby Town F.C. that would potentially promote Orient. The Orient fans were still celebrating this when just 14\u00a0seconds later, Lee Steele scored to confirm Orient's promotion. The result also relegated Oxford to the Football Conference.
