The new attacking team put together by Harvey was being tipped to take one of the major honours come the season's end. By November Newcastle were second in the league, but they fell away to finish 15th, and in the League Cup they were knocked out in the third round. It was down to the FA Cup. Hendon were first up in the third round and a shock 2\u20132 draw at home meant that Newcastle had to go through a replay at Vicarage Road to see off the non-league side 4\u20130. Scunthorpe United were next up in the fourth round, and another shock 1\u20131 draw at St James' meant another replay against lower league opposition. Macdonald scored twice in the replay to crush Scunthorpe's hopes in a 3\u20130 win. The fifth round saw a difficult away draw to West Bromwich Albion, on a quagmire of a pitch and in front of the TV cameras. Newcastle were majestic, winning 3\u20130 with Macdonald scoring again. In the 6th round they were 3.0 down at home to Nottingham Forest when their fans invaded the pitch causing the players to return to the dressing room and play was delayed. When the game did restart Newcastle staged a comeback and won 4.3. The FA ordered the game to be replayed and after an initial 0.0 draw Newcastle won through 1.0 thanks to a McDonald goal. Newcastle faced Burnley at Hillsborough in the semi final. Macdonald scored two and Newcastle won 2\u20130; Harvey would sign Burnley defender Geoff Nulty for the next season after impressing in this game. Newcastle United were through to their first FA Cup final since 1955, where they would play Bill Shankly's Liverpool. Newcastle had a poor build up to final with preparations not going to plan: the tracksuit tops the players were meant to be wearing did not turn up, and they wore purple as they walked out at Wembley Stadium. Macdonald was the key man for Newcastle, having scored in every round for a total of eight goals in the competition. Liverpool played well and coasted to a 3\u20130 win with Kevin Keegan scoring twice. It was the end of an era for Harvey; the next season he signed Micky Burns and paid Sheffield Wednesday a club record \u00a3200,000 for Tommy Craig, but Newcastle could only finish a low 15th, despite getting some revenge on Liverpool, beating them 4\u20131 at St James' Park."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Geoff Nulty||||MF||1974\u20131978||101||11||", "| Geoff Nulty || 1975\u20131978"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 in English football", "response": ["2 February 1977: The Newcastle United squad, led by captain Geoff Nulty, threaten to strike unless Richard Dinnis is appointed as the club's permanent manager, with frictions exacerbated by the board signing Ralph Callachan without consulting either Dinnis or the other players.

Also a former player, having captained the club to FA Cup success the previous decade, the club were moderately successful under his tenureship. They were the Second Division champions in 1965, and won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final in 1969, the last major silverware that the club has won. He also brought in Malcolm Macdonald, Tony Green, Terry McDermott, Geoff Nulty and Micky Burns, all of whom at some point, made notable contributions to the club. Harvey resigned in 1975 after a poor season, and was replaced by Gordon Lee, whose first season saw another mediocre league campaign, albeit with a run to the final of the League Cup. Lee walked out on the club halfway through his second season in charge, leading to inexperienced coach Richard Dinnis being the surprise choice to replace him. Despite initially promising form and a 5th-place finish that saw qualification for the UEFA Cup, Dinnis' spell as manager ended in disaster, and he was sacked early in the following season after the club's worst-ever start to a league campaign. The more experienced Bill McGarry took over, but was powerless to prevent relegation, and left in 1980 after the next two seasons saw promising starts fizzle out into mid-table finishes. Former manager Joe Harvey briefly return as interim manager before Arthur Cox, with whom Harvey had a close friendship, was named manager, and would hold that position for the next four years. Cox steered the club back into the top-flight in 1984, but a fall-out with chairman Stan Seymour Jr. (son of the former manager) saw Cox make the shock move of dropping down two divisions to take over at newly relegated Derby County."]}, {"page": "1967\u201368 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Geoff Nulty"]}]}}
