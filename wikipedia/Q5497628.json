After the 13th Division had all left, the 10th Flotilla continued on escort duties based at Devonport, escorting the ships carrying the next division to be sent to the Gallipoli campaign, the 12th Division.  On 2 July 1915, Mentor, together with  and  escorted the former ocean liner Empress of Britain, on passage from Liverpool to the Dardanelles on the first part of her journey and carrying 4500 troops. Mentor and Miranda left Empress of Britain at about 5:00pm that evening so they could turn back and pick up , another Dardanelles-bound former ocean liner, carrying 5939 tropps which set out from Liverpool on 3 July. The two destroyers left Aquitania on the morning of 4 July, west of the Scilly Isles, and set course for Plymouth, but 30 minutes after they broke off from the liner, the German submarine U-39 missed Aquitania with a torpedo. Later that morning, Mentor and Miranda picked up an SOS call from the transport Anglo-Californian, carrying a load of 927 horses from Canada to Britain. Anglo-Californian was being chased and fired on by U-39. The transport received heavy damage from U-39s guns, with her Captain (Frederick Daniel Parslow, who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for the action) and 20 of her crew being killed, but the arrival of Mentor and Miranda drove off U-39, allowing the transport to be brought into Queenstown."]}]}}
