He made his fortune as the founder of the spread betting firm IG Index in 1974, but was best known for his political activism, being a major donor to the Conservative Party and treasurer of the UK Independence Party from 2011 to 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UK Independence Party", "response": ["In 2006, Farage was elected leader. To attract support, he cultivated an image of himself as a \"man of the people\", openly smoking and drinking, showing disdain for the established parties, and speaking in an open manner that appeared unscripted. He sought to broaden UKIP's image from that of a single-issue party by introducing an array of socially conservative policies, including reducing immigration, tax cuts, restoring grammar schools, and climate change denial. In doing so he was attempting to attract disenfranchised former Conservatives who had left the party after its leader, David Cameron, had moved in a socially liberal direction. According to Farage, Cameron was \"a socialist\" whose priorities were \"gay marriage, foreign aid, and wind farms\". Cameron was highly critical of UKIP, referring to them as \"fruitcakes, loonies, and closet racists\". The Conservatives' largest donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated \u00a3100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron's stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU. After trust in the mainstream parties was damaged by the parliamentary expenses scandal, UKIP received an immediate surge in support. This helped it in the 2009 European Parliament election, in which it secured 2.5\u00a0million votes (16.5%), resulting in 13 MEPs, becoming the second largest party in the European Parliament after the Conservatives. During the election, UKIP outperformed the BNP, whose electoral support base collapsed shortly after.", "UKIP has several high-profile backers. In March 2009, the Conservative Party's biggest-ever donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated \u00a3100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron's stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon. He was then expelled from the Conservatives and in 2011 appointed treasurer of UKIP. In October 2014, Arron Banks, who previously gave \u00a325,000 to the Conservatives, increased his UKIP donation from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a31\u00a0million after Hague said he had never heard of him. The multi-millionaire Paul Sykes has helped finance the party, donating over \u00a31\u00a0million to their 2014 campaign at the European Parliament."]}, {"page": "List of political parties in the United Kingdom", "response": ["| Stuart Wheeler"]}, {"page": "Wheeler (surname)", "response": ["* Cora Stuart Wheeler (1852\u20131897), American poet, author", "* Stuart Wheeler (1935\u20132020), British businessman and politician"]}, {"page": "Alan Budd", "response": ["Among his activities as an economist, he is a governor of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research; a founder member of the UK-Japan 21st Century Group; an executive editor of World Economics and a member of the editorial advisory board of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy.
