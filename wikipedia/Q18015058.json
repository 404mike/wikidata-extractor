This was a style much favoured by professional families at the time in rural Britain but, although bearing similarities to designs in English Regency Pattern Books, the design of Lindesay is simpler, reflecting a mix of Scottish austerity with a good dose of colonial disregard for convention. This very simplicity could possibly be read as a snub to Governor Bourke, who was rapidly becoming persona non grata for Riddell and others in colonial society and whose plans for a new Government House were \"modern Gothic\" and ornate, to say the least. The design owed much to contemporary pattern books and was also attributed initially to James Chadley and Edward Hallen, although the work was completed under the direction of Francis Clarke. It was named in honour of Colonel Patrick Lindesay (1778-1839) who was acting governor of the colony from 22 October to 2 December 1831, between the departure of Governor Darling and the arrival of the next governor, Sir Richard Bourke. This Acting Governor reserved the  for Riddell in 1834 and it is believed that this favour of reserving the land led Riddell to name the house after his friend, the fellow Scot, Patrick Lindesay."]}, {"page": "Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council, 1823\u20131843", "response": ["| Lindesay, PatrickPatrick Lindesay"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["|Colonel Patrick Lindesay"]}, {"page": "1838 Coronation Honours", "response": ["*Major-General Sir Patrick Lindesay "]}, {"page": "Henry Dumaresq (colonial settler)", "response": ["After Darling left the colony, Henry Dumaresq continued to serve as Private Secretary for Acting Governor Patrick Lindesay, but retired from public office once the new governor, liberal-minded Richard Bourke, arrived.
