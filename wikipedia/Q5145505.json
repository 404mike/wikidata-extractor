Robert M. Schoch has argued that the effects of water erosion on the Sphinx and its surrounding enclosure mean that parts of the monument must originally have been carved at the latest between 7000\u20135000 BC. Colin Reader has suggested a date only several hundred years prior to the commonly accepted date for construction.  These views have been almost universally rejected by mainstream Egyptologists who, together with a number of geologists including James Harrell, Lal Gauri, John J. Sinai, and Jayanta K.

Their analyses attribute the apparently accelerated wear on the Sphinx variously to modern industrial pollution, qualitative differences between the layers of limestone in the monument itself, scouring by wind-borne sand, or temperature changes causing the stone to crack."]}, {"page": "Index of ancient Egypt\u2013related articles", "response": ["* Colin Reader"]}, {"page": "Reader (surname)", "response": ["* Colin Reader (born ?), English geologist"]}]}}
