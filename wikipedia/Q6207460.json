In January 1951, after two years at Hull, he moved to Second Division rivals Sheffield United where he played alongside his namesake, Fred Smith, leading to the Scottish player being nicknamed 'Jock' to distinguish them.\nAfter two seasons with the Blades, Smith dropped down to the Third Division South, joining Millwall in January 1953. At the end of his first season at The Den, Millwall finished runners-up, but only the champions (Bristol Rovers) were promoted.\nSmith left Millwall in July 1956, spending a season at Chesterfield, before returning to his native country to join Montrose. He then went on to play for various Highland League clubs, including Peterhead and Fraserburgh. He was part of the Fraserburgh team that knocked Dundee out of the Scottish Cup in January 1959.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jock Smith", "response": ["Jock Smith may refer to:"]}]}}
