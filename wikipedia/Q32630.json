With four games to play, Leeds were two points clear at the top of the league. Whilst playing West Bromwich Albion, Leeds had a Mick Jones goal dissalowed and later in the game a Leeds pass was intercepted by West Bromwich player Tony Brown. Brown paused, as his teammate Colin Suggett was running back from an offside position \u2013 the linesman flagged for offside, and the majority of players stopped when they saw that the flag was raised. Referee Ray Tinkler overruled the linesman, allowing Brown to play the ball to Jeff Astle, who scored what proved to be the winning goal. Both Revie and the Leeds fans were so enraged at the decision that they invaded the pitch to protest, and consequently the FA banned Leeds from playing their first five home games of the following season at home. Despite winning all their remaining games (including a 1\u20130 victory over rivals Arsenal) Leeds lost the title to Arsenal by 1 point, in doing so accumulating a record number of points for second place, 12 points ahead of third placed Tottenham. In addition, Leeds went out of the FA Cup in the 5th round in a shock 3\u20132 defeat by Colchester, who were in the Fourth Division at the time. There was consolation in Europe though; Leeds won the Fairs Cup for a second time, beating Juventus over two legs, with Mick Bates, Paul Madeley and Allan Clarke scoring the crucial goals."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Mick Bates||||1978\u20131980||56||1||"]}, {"page": "Mick Bates", "response": ["Mick Bates may refer to:", "*Mick Bates (Australian footballer) (born 1949), Australian rules footballer", "*Mick Bates (English footballer) (1947\u20132021), English footballer", "*Mick Bates (Welsh politician) (born 1947), Welsh politician", "*Mick Bates (West Virginia politician) (born 1970), American politician"]}, {"page": "1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final", "response": ["|CM ||4 || Mick Bates  "]}, {"page": "1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["|MF||7|| Mick Bates"]}, {"page": "1971 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["|MF||12|| Mick Bates || || ", "|MF||12|| Mick Bates ||  "]}, {"page": "Leeds United F.C.
