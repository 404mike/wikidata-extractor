He has resided in County Dublin, Ireland since his family moved to Malahide in 1965, when he was five years old. Clayton attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School, where he met schoolmates with whom he co-founded U2 in 1976. A member of the band since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with U2.\nClayton's bass playing style is noted for its \"harmonic syncopation\", giving the music a driving rhythm. He is well known for his bass playing on songs such as \"Gloria\", \"New Year's Day\", \"Bullet the Blue Sky\", \"With or Without You\", \"Mysterious Ways\", \"Vertigo\", \"Get on Your Boots\", and \"Magnificent\". He has worked on several solo projects throughout his career, such as his work with fellow band member Larry Mullen Jr. on the 1996 version of the \"Theme from Mission: Impossible\". As a member of U2, Clayton has received 22 Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Salman Rushdie", "response": ["The publication of the book and the fatw\u0101 sparked violence around the world, with bookstores firebombed.

Despite the danger posed by the fatw\u0101, Rushdie made a public appearance at London's Wembley Stadium on 11 August 1993 during a concert by U2.

When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [could] tell from [drummer] Larry Mullen, Jr.'s face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible.
