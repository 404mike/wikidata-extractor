It lay abandoned by 1799. In 1896, the two towers were restored and its central building rebuilt by Jenkins & Marr for Sir John Duthie. In the late Victorian period the castle, by now almost a ruin after a 1915 fire, was purchased and restored by the wealthy Duthie family of Aberdeen. In 1934 it returned to the Fraser family after being bought by Lord Saltoun, a direct descendant of the 8th Laird. Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun, and her husband, Captain Alexander Ramsay of Mar, who was one of Queen Victoria's great-grandchildren, lived there for a while. Their daughter, Katharine Fraser, Mistress of Saltoun, took possession of the castle in 1997."]}, {"page": "Katharine Fraser", "response": ["#REDIRECT Katharine Fraser, Mistress of Saltoun"]}, {"page": "Katherine Fraser", "response": ["*Katharine Fraser, Mistress of Saltoun"]}]}}
