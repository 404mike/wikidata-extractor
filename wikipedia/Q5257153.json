He was born in Newry, County Down, the eldest son of William Heron, a merchant, and his wife Mary Maguire of Enniskillen. He was educated at Downside Abbey, Stratton-on-the-Fosse, and proceeded to Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a Scholar.In December 1845 Heron was the subject of a celebrated hearing at Trinity College Dublin. Heron had previously been examined and, on merit, declared a scholar of the college but had not been allowed to take up his place due to his religion. Heron appealed to the Courts which issued a writ of mandamus requiring the case to be adjudicated by the Archbishop of Dublin and the Primate of Ireland. The decision of Richard Whately and John George Beresford was that Heron would remain excluded from Scholarship.In 1848 he received his law doctorate, and was called to the Bar. By 1852 Heron was professor of jurisprudence and political economy at Queen's College, Galway. In July 1860 he was appointed Queen's Counsel. He became a Bencher of the King's Inn in 1872. He was Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1866 to 1868 in which capacity he was much occupied with prosecuting the trials that followed the Fenian Rising of 1867. In 1880 became Third Serjeant-at-law (Ireland). His death the following year put a premature end to a brilliant career.In the 1869 by-election for Tipperary constituency, Heron was defeated by 1054 to 898 votes by the incumbent, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa. However the election was declared invalid because Rossa was an imprisoned felon and, in the second election, Heron defeated the Fenian candidate and was returned to the Commons. He held Tipperary until 1874.\nHe was the author of Constitutional History of the University of Dublin (1847), An Introduction to the History of Jurisprudence (1860), and Principles of Jurisprudence (1873). He was a long-standing member of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, and served as its Vice-President for several years.Denis Caulfield Heron, who was a keen sportsman, died suddenly of a heart attack while he was salmon fishing in the Corrib River in County Galway in April 1881. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery; almost all the leading legal Irish legal and political figures attended the funeral. He had married Emily FitzGerald, youngest daughter of David and Catherine FitzGerald, and sister of John FitzGerald, Baron FitzGerald; she predeceased him. They had no children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trinity College Dublin", "response": ["During the 18th century Trinity College was seen as the university of the Protestant Ascendancy. Parliament, meeting on the other side of College Green, made generous grants for building. The first building of this period was the Old Library, begun in 1712, followed by the Printing House and the Dining Hall. During the second half of the century, Parliament Square slowly emerged. The great building drive was completed in the early 19th century by Botany Bay, the square which derives its name in part from the herb garden it once contained (and which was succeeded by Trinity College's own Botanic Gardens). Following early steps in Catholic Emancipation, Catholics were first allowed to apply for admission in 1793, before the equivalent change at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. Certain disabilities remained. In December 1845 Denis Caulfield Heron was the subject of a hearing at Trinity College.

Protestant Alliance; 9 January 1846; pg5 col D This decision confirmed that persons who were not Anglicans (Presbyterians were also affected) could not be elected to Scholarship or Fellowship or be made a Professor. But after less than three decades of this, all disabilities imposed on Catholics were repealed, as in 1873, all religious tests were abolished, except for entry to the divinity school. In 1871, Irish Catholic bishops, responding to the increased ease with which Catholics could attend an Institution which the bishops saw as thoroughly Protestant in ethos, and in light of the establishment of the Catholic University of Ireland, implemented a general ban on Catholics entering Trinity College, with few exceptions. \"The ban,\" despite its longevity, is associated in the popular mind with Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid, as he was made responsible for enforcing it from 1956 until the Catholic Bishops of Ireland rescinded it in 1970, shortly before McQuaid's retirement.
