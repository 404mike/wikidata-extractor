She represented\nGreat Britain in the Marathon at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics and in the 1999 edition of the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships.\nLodge grew up in Liverpool and was a good club athlete at Liverpool Harriers. Her first marathon was with the uncategorised masses at the 1995 London Marathon where she finished with a respectable time of 3 hrs 9mins. A win at the 1999 Fleet Half Marathon was a precursor to representing Great Britain at the 1999 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships where she finished 48th behind compatriots Marian Sutton(22nd) and Birhan Dagne(29th).\nAn excellent finish in the 2002 Berlin Marathon, in a personal best time of 2:34:17 gave her a place in the British team at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris. As the only British competitor in the race she finished mid-field in a time of 2:37:56. The following year at the London Marathon she came home as the third British woman (13th woman overall), in a time of 2:34:49, behind emerging athlete Tracey Morris and Birhan Dagne.\nAt the time Lodge was a member of Windsor, Slough, Eton and Hounslow Athletic Club and a teacher of art and ceramics at Gunnersbury Catholic School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1999 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships", "response": ["|align=center| 48 || Jo Lodge ||  ||  1:17:36 || ", "|align=center| 8 ||  || Marian SuttonBirhan DagneJo Lodge ||  3:43:53"]}, {"page": "Fleet Half Marathon", "response": ["|18|| 21 Mar 1999|| 1:07:23 || Stuart Hall || 1:18:00 || Jo Lodge"]}, {"page": "Joanna Lodge", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jo Lodge"]}, {"page": "2002 Berlin Marathon", "response": ["| Jo Lodge"]}, {"page": "2002 London Marathon", "response": ["|align=center| 12 || Jo Lodge || || 2:38:25"]}, {"page": "2000 London Marathon", "response": ["|align=center| 23 || Jo Lodge ||  || 2:40:52"]}, {"page": "1999 London Marathon", "response": ["|align=center| 15 || Jo Lodge ||  || 2:45:46"]}]}}
