She later admitted, \"I had not heard of him\" as she had not been a particularly \"political person\" and that he was a strange subject for a newspaper she described as \"extreme centre\". On 31 January 1988, the Sunday Times published Allan's interview with Terre'Blanche for Allan's Face to Face column. In the interview, Allan wrote of her fascination with Terre'Blanche: \"Right now I've got to remind myself to breathe ... I'm impaled on the blue flames of his blowtorch eyes.\" Despite claiming that she became the \"heroine of the newsroom\" for her frankness, she later told the Sunday Times journalist Stuart Wavell that she regretted describing Terre'Blanche in these terms, not realising the political veneration that would be read into them. She pointed towards the lack of knowledge she had about Adolf Hitler's personality cult: \"It sounds farfetched, but we are only taught South African history at school.\" Although Wavell identified that the words were not significant compared to her other material; \"a perusal of her interviews shows a fondness for such extravagant language.\" Allan later told a journalist that \"From the moment that interview was published, my life was over. It has destroyed my career in South Africa.\"", "Allan later spoke about the Paardekraal incident in an interview with the London Sunday Times, remarking that it resembled a \"set-up\". She explained to Stuart Wavell; \"Fifteen police cars appeared and I don't know how many policemen. It was like the movies. I said, \"Am I on Candid Camera?\". Later, relations between the pair cooled and an acrimonious battle ensued in the press,\"Blonde bomshell rips into South Africa's neo-Nazis\", Sunday Times, 8 January 1989 with Allan taking legal action against Terre'Blanche because of repeated nuisance contact. A case of crimen injuria was laid against Terre'Blanche in March 1989 relating to the damaged gates, with Allan subpoenaed as chief witness for the state. Ultimately Allan was not required to testify, and Terre'Blanche was acquitted.Youtube video :"]}]}}
