He was one of the founders of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and an internationally recognized contributor to the fields of heat transfer, fluid mechanics and combustion. He created the practice of CFD \u2013 its application to problems of interest to engineers. Most of today\u2019s commercially available CFD software tools trace their origin to the work done by Spalding's group in the decade spanning the mid-60s and mid-70s. Spalding became a Fellow of the Royal Society and Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.\nSpalding was born at New Malden, Surrey, England, and educated at King's College School, Wimbledon. He received his BA degree in Engineering Science from Oxford University in 1944 and PhD from Cambridge University in 1952. He joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College in 1954 as a Reader in Heat Transfer. On his promotion to Professor of Heat Transfer in 1958 he gave his inaugural lecture entitled Heat Transfer in Rocket Motors. He was the founder of the company Concentration Heat And Momentum Limited, (CHAM) specialising in computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer processes. CHAM's major product is the widely used PHOENICS CFD code. Spalding himself was the main creator of, and contributor to, PHOENICS.\nTogether with his student Suhas Patankar he developed the SIMPLE algorithm, a widely used numerical procedure to solve the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\nIn late 1970s and early 1980s, Brian Spalding was the Reilly Professor of Combustion Engineering at Purdue University.\nThough in his 90s, Spalding continued to be active in his field, and was taken ill while at an international conference in Russia.  He died on his return to the UK.", "link_mentions": {}}}
