He would make 8 appearances for Brian Laws side during this spell which led to him joining the club permanently in March 1996 when Leicester and Grimsby agreed a \u00a350,000 transfer fee. In his time at Grimsby he was in and out of the team both under Laws and his replacement Alan Buckley. The Mariners defensive set up in the mid to late nineties had boasted such club legends as Mark Lever, Peter Handyside, John McDermott, Graham Rodger and Kevin Jobling, so Smith was dipped in and out of the first team. The club were eventually relegated to the Second Division in May 1997, only to bounce back the following season by winning the Second Division Play-Off Final at Wembley Stadium. Town had also triumphed in the Football League Trophy that season, but injury had forced Smith to miss the entire season."]}, {"page": "Peter Handyside", "response": ["Handyside was trialed by Grimsby Town and was signed by the club's youth team in 1990. He took his step up into the first team in 1992 and was eventually the club's long term replacement for veteran centre back Paul Futcher and made an excellent pairing with Mark Lever. Handyside's maturity grew and he became an integral part of Grimsby's defensive setup, and along with Lever, John McDermott, Tony Gallimore, Graham Rodger, Kevin Jobling and Richard Smith was part of arguably Grimsby's best ever defence. The 1997\u20131998 Handyside continued to be the nucleus of Town's strong defence that helped achieve a promotion to back to the First Division via the play-offs, and victory in the Football League Trophy. He bowed out at Grimsby after the 2000\u201301 season. An injury troubled campaign, he was often replaced by loan signing Zhang Enhua. At the end of the season, he rejected the chance to stay on with Grimsby and moved to Second Division Stoke City."]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Football League Trophy", "response": ["|MF ||14||Kevin Jobling || "]}, {"page": "1998 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|MF ||14||Kevin Jobling || "]}, {"page": "Jopling", "response": ["* Kevin Jobling (born 1968), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1998 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["|MF ||||Kevin Jobling"]}, {"page": "Jobling", "response": ["*Kevin Jobling (born 1968), English footballer"]}]}}
