The couple collected Dutch and Flemish 17th-century paintings. She became a still life painter and took her inspiration from works in her collection and elsewhere. She showed her work at the Royal Academy summer exhibition for the first time in 1925. Two of her paintings were included in the Ashmolean bequest that comprises 96 paintings.", "link_mentions": {}}}
