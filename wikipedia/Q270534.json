According to Richie Unterberger of AllMusic, the album's reputation has improved significantly over time as the music is \"deserving of its classic status\". Tony Scherman from Entertainment Weekly said Dusty in Memphis is a \"pure gem\", Springfield's greatest work, and perhaps one of the greatest pop records ever recorded. Q took note of its balance between \"R&B and sensitive pop dramas\", while Spin critic Chuck Eddy viewed it as one of the all-important blue-eyed soul records. In The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps wrote that Springfield and her team of musicians and producers for Dusty in Memphis developed an elegant and distinct fusion of pop and R&B that predated the Philadelphia soul sound of the 1970s. According to Eric Klinger from PopMatters, its sophisticated style of music influenced the sound of 1990s trip hop artists who sampled songs from the album and became a blueprint for British female singers of the 2000s, including Adele, Amy Winehouse, Duffy, Joss Stone, Paloma Faith and Rumer."]}, {"page": "David Wiffen", "response": ["\"Driving Wheel (Lost My Driving Wheel)\" was covered by Tom Rush on his 1970 self-titled album, Roger McGuinn in 1973 on his self-titled first solo album.
