After leaving school he spent a year in 1959\u201360 working for Voluntary Service Overseas in British North Borneo before returning to London to study painting at the Royal College of Art, where he became strongly influenced by Op Art and in particular the work of Victor Vasarely. Bevan graduated from the RCA in 1964 and had his first exhibition of Op Art-inspired paintings the following year. Optical, geometric and kinetic art then served him well until the late 1970s when he moved to the Canadian prairies for a two-year teaching post at the University of Saskatchewan. By the time he returned to London in 1979 he had abandoned abstract art in favour of figurative art and urban realism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Uz\u00e8s", "response": ["*Oliver Bevan (2001-) English artist"]}, {"page": "Fontana Modern Masters", "response": ["The Fontana Modern Masters occupy a unique place in publishing history \u2013 not for their contents but their covers, which draw on the following developments in twentieth-century art and literature:James Pardey. \"The Shape of the Century\".

However, a visit to the Grabowski Gallery in London introduced Constable to the work of Oliver Bevan, a graduate of the Royal College of Art in 1964, whose optical and geometric paintings were influenced by Vasarely's Op Art. On seeing Bevan's work, Constable commissioned him to create the covers for the first ten Fontana Modern Masters, which Bevan painted as rectilinear arrangements of tesselating blocks. Each cover was thus a piece of abstract art, but as an incentive for readers to buy all ten books the covers could be arranged to create a larger, composite artwork. The \"set of ten\" books appeared in 1970\u201371 but overran when Joyce was published with the same cover as Guevara:"]}, {"page": "Bevan, Oliver", "response": ["#redirectOliver Bevan"]}]}}
