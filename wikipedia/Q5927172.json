After poor take-off and landing results, he occupied the 8th position eventually. Due to lack of folding wings and engine starter, John Carberry fell from the 2nd to 11th position, only to regain this position thanks to best aircraft evaluation. However, mediocre take-off and landing results gave him the 6th place overall. Technical part saw a duel between Reinhold Poss and Fritz Morzik, occupying the 3rd and 4th places respectively after the circuit part.

It went to RAF Martlesham Heath for further Air Ministry specification tests late in August.  In December it was replaced there by the second prototype which had first flown on 30 October 1924.  By the spring of 1927 it was clear that the Blackburn Ripon was preferred, and in June the second prototype was returned to Handley Page rather than going forward to the seaplane trials, chiefly because of its persistent overheating. Nonetheless, Handley Page gained funding for a Harrow Mk II using a more powerful Napier Lion XI engine producing 530\u00a0hp (395\u00a0kW) in the first prototype airframe.  This engine was housed in a slimmer, more pointed cowling with a semi-circular cross-section radiator under the nose.  At the same time drag was reduced and rudder and elevator lightness improved by lowering the rear fuselage decking and with it the gunner's position.  Later in the summer a Lion XA was fitted, together with a larger, square radiator.  Further modifications to the Mk II followed with the addition of dihedral to both wings, a slimmer nose and retractable side radiators like those on its competitor, the Ripon II. There were further modifications to flaps and slots before the aircraft went back to Martlesham to compete against the Ripon II and the Avro Buffalo II, performing torpedo dropping trials before going to Felixstowe as a floatplane.
