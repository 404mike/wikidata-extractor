Along with two smaller bells, they were appropriated and transported by Lieutenant Colonel John St George, who commanded the Royal Artillery siege train. They were displayed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, before the larger one was taken to Aldershot Garrison, where it was mounted on a wooden frame on Gun Hill. In 1879, it was moved to the bell tower of the Cambridge Military Hospital, the garrison's medical facility. It was moved in 1978 to the officer's mess in Hospital Road and more recently to St Omer Barracks; it is a Grade II listed structure. The second bell was taken to Windsor Castle and installed in the Round Tower; by tradition it is only rung on the death of a king or queen."]}, {"page": "John George", "response": ["*John St George (1812\u20131891),  British Army officer"]}, {"page": "John St. George", "response": ["#REDIRECT John St George"]}, {"page": "List of British Army full generals", "response": ["| Sir John St George || 1812 || 1891 ||"]}, {"page": "20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)", "response": ["* Maj-Gen John St George, RA, appointed Col Cmdt 21st and 26th (Royal Arsenal) Kent RVCs 11 May 1864"]}, {"page": "1889 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*General Sir John St George   Royal Artillery."]}, {"page": "1869 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Major-General John St George "]}]}}
