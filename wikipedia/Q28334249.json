Midgard). Accordingly, the medievalists Stuart D.

Tolkien note that The Silmarillion emphasises M\u00edriel's skill, naming her in early versions Byrde, later Serind\u00eb, \"the broideress\"; she passes on her \"surpassing skill\" in craftsmanship to her only son. Solopova suggests a possible link to Tolkien's study of the Middle English word burde, conventionally meaning \"lady, damsel\"; he proposed that it derived from Old English borde, \"embroidery\" and pointed out that in Old Norse and Old English poetry, formulas for \"woman\" included \"weaver\" and \"embroideress\"."]}, {"page": "F\u00ebanor", "response": ["The philologist Elizabeth Solopova suggests that the character of F\u00ebanor was inspired by Byrhtnoth from the Anglo-Saxon poem \"The Battle of Maldon\" who is slain in battle.

Both battles take place between civilisations of the \"East\" and \"West\", and like Jordanes, Tolkien describes his battle as one of legendary fame that lasted for several generations. Another apparent similarity is the death of the Visigoth king Theodoric I on the Catalaunian Fields and that of Th\u00e9oden on the Pelennor. Jordanes reports that Theodoric was thrown off by his horse and trampled to death by his own men who charged forward. Th\u00e9oden similarly rallies his men shortly before he falls and is crushed by his horse. And like Theodoric, Th\u00e9oden is carried from the battlefield with his knights weeping and singing for him while the battle still goes on., pp. 70\u201373"]}, {"page": "Harad", "response": ["In drafts of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien toyed with names such as Harwan and Sunharrowland for Harad, which were derived from Sigelwara; Christopher Tolkien notes that these are connected to his father's Sigelwara Land.J.

XXV p. 435 & p. 439 note 4 (comments by Christopher Tolkien) The philologist Elizabeth Solopova similarly notes that the hobbits' name for Harad, Sunland, suggests a similar link."]}]}}
