Irvine made a total of 11 first-team appearances for Halifax Town, scoring one goal for the club. He played his last competitive game for the club in the 1\u20130 win against York City on 13 March 1973, after manager George Mulhall accused Irvine of not trying and not deserving his wage.

Napoli ended the match with 10 men after defender  was sent off for kicking Lochhead in the head. The return leg three weeks later proved to be much more difficult for Burnley. The Italian press previewed the match in a belligerent manner: \"From Lancashire where studs are made out of rose petals ... to Naples where visiting players are put through a mincing machine at the end of the game and their remains are roasted on a spit\". A crowd of 60,000 saw Burnley goalkeeper Harry Thomson making 13 saves, including a penalty kick from Jos\u00e9 Altafini, as the match ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The game was again not without controversy: Dave Merrington was elbowed in the stomach by a frustrated Omar Sivori in the closing stages of the match and after the match ended, Thomson was spat in his face by Alberto Orlando, who also refused his handshake. The team, the Burnley fans and the English press were escorted to the airport by a convoy to escape the Napoli fans, who hurled missiles during the match.
