After qualifying in 1903, he held house appointments at the East London Hospital for Children, and then studied psychiatry in Paris and Zurich. After working as an assistant physician at the Hertfordshire County Asylum, otherwise known as Hill End Hospital at St Albans, and at Long Grove Asylum in Epsom, he was appointed in 1913 as the first physician for psychological medicine at University College Hospital. \nAt the beginning of WWI he joined the RAMC with the rank of major and served as lecturer in mental disease at Moss Side Military Hospital, Maghull, where veterans with shell-shock were treated. He was also physician to the Special Neurological Hospital for Officers at 10 Palace Green, Kensington, West London, as well as psychiatric consultant to other military hospitals in London. \nAfter the end of WWI, he returned to University College Hospital and also joined the staff of the National Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System including Paralysis and Epilepsy, Queen Square, London, and the staff of the Maudsley Hospital in south London. Upon the founding of The Journal of Neurology and Psychopathology in 1920, he was one of the nine members of the editorial committee, headed by Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson.\nHart's 1910 paper The conception of the subconscious introduced the works of Janet and Freud to English-speaking psychologists. In 1925 he was elected FRCP. In 1926 he delivered the Goulstonian Lectures on The Development of Psychopathology and its Place in Medicine.\nDuring the second world war he was chief adviser on psychiatric matters to the Emergency Medical Service, working in close partnership with Gordon Holmes. He was appointed CBE in 1945 in recognition of this work. Two years later he retired and went to live at Eastbourne.\nIn 1912 in the Strand area of Central London, Hart married Mabel E. Spark. He was a member of the Savile Club. His outdoor recreations were mountaineering and skiing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University College School", "response": ["*Bernard Hart \u2013 psychiatrist (1945)"]}, {"page": "Arthur Tansley", "response": ["Tansley was introduced to psychology by a former student, Bernard Hart, who worked as a doctor in mental hospitals near London.  While working for the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War, he had a dream which was described as \"one of the major turning points in his life\" \u2013 from this dream came Tansley's interest in Freud and psychoanalysis. In 1920 he published The New Psychology and its Relation to Life, one of the first books that attempted to introduce the ideas of Freud and Carl Jung to a general audience. The book was a bestseller, selling 10,000 copies in the United Kingdom and 4,000 in the United States. In 1922 Tansley spent three months with Freud, and the following year he moved his family to Vienna for a year. Although he later returned to botanical pursuits, Tansley remained in contact with Freud and wrote his obituary. Research by Peder Anker has suggested a close theoretical relationship between Tansley's ecology and his psychology."]}, {"page": "Hervey M.

He also says his method takes inspiration from that used in an earlier work, The Psychology of Insanity by English physician Bernard Hart (first edition published in 1912 and now open access)."]}, {"page": "Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry", "response": ["The journal was established in 1920 by Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson as the Journal of Neurology and Psychopathology.

Therefore, instead of pursuing Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, he began his career in psychiatry serving at Hill End Hospital in St Albans, whilst simultaneously working as a clinical assistant to Bernard Hart at University College Hospital. He later worked at Cassel Hospital, Penshurst, Kent."]}]}}
