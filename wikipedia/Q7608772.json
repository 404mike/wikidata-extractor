In 2006, he presented the Channel 4 series, Make Me A Grownup. He also presents The 10 Demandments for Channel Five. Briers has also appeared as an expert psychologist on GMTV. He presented Freaky Eaters with nutritionist Natalie Savona for one series.\nHe has written a parenting book called Superpowers for parents.\nA co-author of the book Teen Angels (2006), based on the BBC Three series, Briers has also written Help your Child to Succeed in Life. He also contributes frequently to the Times Educational Supplement.\nHis latest book, Psychobabble: Exploding the Myths of the Self-help Generation, debunking a wide range of psychobabble, was published in September 2012 through Pearson. The book sets out to \"debunk the myths and expose the quack theories of the multi-million-pound self-improvement industry\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neuro-linguistic programming", "response": ["According to Stollznow, \"Bandler and Grinder's infamous Frogs into Princes and their other books boast that NLP is a cure-all that treats a broad range of physical and mental conditions and learning difficulties, including epilepsy, myopia and dyslexia. With its promises to cure schizophrenia, depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and its dismissal of psychiatric illnesses as psychosomatic, NLP shares similarities with Scientology and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR).\" A systematic review of experimental studies by Sturt et al (2012) concluded that \"there is little evidence that NLP interventions improve health-related outcomes.\" In his review of NLP, Stephen Briers writes, \"NLP is not really a cohesive therapy but a ragbag of different techniques without a particularly clear theoretical basis...[and its] evidence base is virtually non-existent.\" Eisner writes, \"NLP appears to be a superficial and gimmicky approach to dealing with mental health problems. Unfortunately, NLP appears to be the first in a long line of mass marketing seminars that purport to virtually cure any mental disorder...it appears that NLP has no empirical or scientific support as to the underlying tenets of its theory or clinical effectiveness. What remains is a mass-marketed serving of psychopablum.\"", "Clinical psychologist Stephen Briers questions the value of the NLP maxim\u2014a presupposition in NLP jargon\u2014\"there is no failure, only feedback\". Briers argues that the denial of the existence of failure diminishes its instructive value. He offers Walt Disney, Isaac Newton and J.K. Rowling as three examples of unambiguous acknowledged personal failure that served as an impetus to great success. According to Briers, it was \"the crash-and-burn type of failure, not the sanitised NLP Failure Lite, i.e. the failure-that-isn't really-failure sort of failure\" that propelled these individuals to success. Briers contends that adherence to the maxim leads to self-deprecation. According to Briers, personal endeavour is a product of invested values and aspirations and the dismissal of personally significant failure as mere feedback effectively denigrates what one values. Briers writes, \"Sometimes we need to accept and mourn the death of our dreams, not just casually dismiss them as inconsequential.\" Briers also contends that the NLP maxim is narcissistic, self-centered and divorced from notions of moral responsibility."]}, {"page": "Tanya Byron", "response": ["Tanya Byron, Stephen Briers, Rachel Morris and Laverne Antrobus became household names working on the British TV show Little Angels (which ran for three series), a docu-soap that follows the lives of families where the children have behavioural problems that are causing the parents difficulty. The show is seen as a 'life line' by the parents who are effectively calling professionals with years of experience of working with children and families to help them fix a problem that they believe beyond their ability to fix. Tanya Byron, Stephen Briers, Rachel Morris and Laverne Antrobus, monitor the behaviour of the family and the children before discussing with the parents the real underlying causes of the problem (which are nearly always in some way either caused by or contributed to by the parents themselves \u2013 usually by inadvertently rewarding inappropriate behaviour with their attention). They then discuss a course of action with them and later they coach them in how to change their own and their children's behaviour to improve the situation (this is frequently done in scenes where the family is filmed doing something together with the parents receiving advice from the attending professional via an ear piece). The show is intended to be instructive to viewers in how to deal with common problems as well as of real help to the family being filmed (and of course entertaining)."]}, {"page": "Freaky Eaters (British TV programme)", "response": ["The first series was presented by nutritionist Natalie Savona and psychological coach Benjamin Fry.
