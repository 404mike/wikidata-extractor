She then went to Leicester Polytechnic where as a fashion student, she was expelled for having a man in her room. She then tried to go to Jacob Kramer Art College in Leeds. Andrew Tilberis was an art tutor and looked over her portfolio for admission. He was unimpressed with her work, but Liz gave him a speech why she wanted to attend and won him over (and later married him).In 1967, British Vogue held a contest requiring three essays. Liz was the runner-up and began an internship there, making tea, picking up dress pins, and ironing for fashion shoots for 25 pounds per week. Beatrix Miller, then editor-in-chief, noticed how nice and enthusiastic Liz was, and was promoted to fashion assistant in 1970. In 1971 she married Andrew Tilberis, whom her father forbade her to marry because \"he was a foreigner\". They remained married for almost 30 years until her death.During the 1970s and early 1980s, Liz began fertility treatments to try to conceive. They were not successful and she adopted sons Robert in 1981 and Christopher in 1985. After 20 years at British Vogue, she was offered a lucrative job in New York City as part of Ralph Lauren's design team in 1987. She sold her house, packed up, and was about to leave for the United States. Anna Wintour, the then-editor, suddenly called Liz into her office, and informed her that she was moving to New York to become the new editor of House & Garden. Wintour offered her job to Tilberis, who accepted. Its circulation began to rise under her leadership and she said, \"My staff are respectful rather than frightened.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harper's Bazaar", "response": ["* Liz Tilberis (1992\u20131999)"]}, {"page": "Vogue (magazine)", "response": ["|Liz Tilberis"]}, {"page": "Anna Wintour", "response": ["Under her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under Vreeland.
