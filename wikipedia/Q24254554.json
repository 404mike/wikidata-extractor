He was the oldest son of Richard Bright (1754\u20131840), a merchant and banker in Bristol, and Sarah n\u00e9e Heywood, and the older brother of the physician Richard Bright, who described Bright's disease. His grandfather was Henry Bright (1715\u20131777), a Bristol merchant active in the Jamaican slave trade, Mayor of Bristol in 1771\u201372.He was educated at Reading School and Peterhouse, Cambridge (admitted 1801, graduated B.A. 1807, M.A. 1810) and elected to a fellowship at Peterhouse in 1810. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1804, he was called to the bar in 1810, practising as a barrister on the western circuit.Elected MP for Bristol in 1820 as a Whig in the West India Interest, Bright generally opposed the Tory government of Lord Liverpool. However, he was mindful of constituency considerations, and in May 1820 supported the Western Union Canal bill as \"eminently advantageous\".The Slave Trade Act 1807 had outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire, but had not abolished slavery. The attitude of Bright's constituents in Bristol is characterised by an anonymous pamphlet letter addressed to Bright in 1823, which argued against the immediate abolition of slavery. Bright was a member of the West India Committee, and of a committee formed in 1823 to resist moves towards emancipation. He complained of \"gross exaggerations\" in the Southwark anti-slavery petition. After the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, in 1836, Bright collected slave compensation for Edward Smith of the Haughton Pen Estate in Saint Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica.He was re-elected in 1826 but stood down in 1830, being \"tired of it and the expense\".He succeeded to his father's estates in Herefordshire and Hampshire in 1840, inheriting also a one-fifth share of the Jamaican property and a one-seventh share of the residue. Bright died on 26 March 1869.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reading School", "response": ["|Henry Bright"]}, {"page": "James Franck Bright", "response": ["Bright was lord of the manor of Brockbury in Colwall, Herefordshire, having inherited the estate by the will of his uncle Henry Bright  in 1869."]}, {"page": "Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Henry Bright"]}, {"page": "Henry Bright", "response": ["Henry Bright may refer to:", "*Henry Bright (schoolmaster, born 1562) (1562\u20131627), English priest and schoolmaster at the King's School, Worcester", "*Henry Bright (schoolmaster, born 1724) (1724\u20131803), English priest and schoolmaster at Abingdon School and New College School", "*Henry Bright (MP) (1784\u20131869), MP for Bristol", "*Henry Bright (painter) (1810\u20131873), English painter"]}, {"page": "Henry Arthur Bright", "response": ["Bright was born at Liverpool on 9 February 1830, the eldest son of Samuel Bright  (1799\u20131870; a younger brother of Henry Bright  and the pathologist Richard Bright), by Elizabeth Anne, eldest daughter of Hugh Jones, a Liverpool banker.
