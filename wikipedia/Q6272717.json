He met then-chancellor Helmut Schmidt professionally; they eventually developed a close personal friendship, and he wrote the biography Helmut Schmidt: Helmsman of Germany in 1985.His 1993 book Goodbye Germany, occasioned by German reunification, was an international bestseller, and in 1998 he wrote Mahler: a Biography of the Austrian composer.He died in K\u00f6nigswinter, North Rhine-Westphalia at the age of 66, on 12 June 2008, on the very day his final book The Wagner Clan was published.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gustav Mahler", "response": ["Mahler developed interests in German philosophy, and was introduced by his friend Siegfried Lipiner to the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustav Fechner and Hermann Lotze. These thinkers continued to influence Mahler and his music long after his student days were over. Mahler's biographer Jonathan Carr says that the composer's head was \"not only full of the sound of Bohemian bands, trumpet calls and marches, Bruckner chorales and Schubert sonatas. It was also throbbing with the problems of philosophy and metaphysics he had thrashed out, above all, with Lipiner.\"Carr, pp. 24\u201328"]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)", "response": ["Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson, and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has been compared by Deryck Cooke to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 as a defining human statement for its century.", "The years after World War II saw a number of notable performances of the Eighth Symphony, including Sir Adrian Boult's broadcast from the Royal Albert Hall on 10\u00a0February 1948, the Japanese premiere under Kazuo Yamada in Tokyo in December 1949, and the Australian premiere under Sir Eugene Goossens in 1951. A Carnegie Hall performance under Stokowski in 1950 became the first complete recording of the symphony to be issued. After 1950 the increasing numbers of performances and recordings of the work signified its growing popularity, but not all critics were won over. Theodor W. Adorno found the piece weak, \"a giant symbolic shell\";Carr, p. 186 this most affirmative work of Mahler's is, in Adorno's view, his least successful, musically and artistically inferior to his other symphonies.La Grange (2000), p. 928 The composer-critic Robert Simpson, usually a champion of Mahler, referred to Part\u00a0II as \"an ocean of shameless kitsch.\" Mahler biographer Jonathan Carr finds much of the symphony \"bland\", lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer's other symphonies. Deryck Cooke, on the other hand, compares Mahler's Eighth to Beethoven's Choral (Ninth) Symphony. To Cooke, Mahler's is \"the Choral Symphony of the twentieth century: like Beethoven's, but in a different way, it sets before us an ideal [of redemption] which we are as yet far from realising\u2014even perhaps moving away from\u2014but which we can hardly abandon without perishing\".Cooke, pp. 93\u201395"]}, {"page": "Siegfried Wagner", "response": ["In 1892 he undertook a trip to Asia with a friend, the English composer Clement Harris.
