The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to toe in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed for the first time in its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium \u2013 a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium."]}, {"page": "2001 in film", "response": ["| The Mummy Returns || Universal Pictures / Alphaville Films || Stephen Sommers (director/screenplay); Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Freddie Boath, Oded Fehr, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Vel\u00e1squez, Alun Armstrong, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Shaun Parkes, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Bruce Byron, Joe Dixon, Tom Parker, Aharon Ipale || Adventure || Live action"]}, {"page": "Parkes", "response": ["* Shaun Parkes (born 1973), English actor"]}, {"page": "The Mummy Returns", "response": ["* Shaun Parkes as Izzy Buttons"]}, {"page": "The Inspector Lynley Mysteries", "response": ["* Shaun Parkes as Detective Constable Winston Nkata (Series 5-6)"]}, {"page": "Casanova (2005 TV serial)", "response": ["Telling the story of the life of 18th century Italian adventurer Giacomo Casanova, based on his own twelve-volume memoirs, the one-hour episodes star Peter O'Toole as the older Casanova looking back on his life and David Tennant as the younger version.
