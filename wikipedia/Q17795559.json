Influenced by the work of another Australian poet, John Farrell, his representation of the bushman as a tough, independent and heroic underdog became the ideal qualities underpinning the national character. His work is often compared to the prose of Henry Lawson, particularly the seminal work, \"The Drover's Wife\", which presented a considerably less romantic view of the harshness of rural existence of the late 19th century."]}, {"page": "John Bernard O'Hara", "response": ["In his youth O'Hara was a skillful cricketer and played pennant cricket for many years.

During this time Stevens worked as a freelance journalist, coming into contact with a number of literary figures, he edited My Sundowner and other Poems (1904) by John Farrell with a memoir. Stevens prepared An Anthology of Australian Verse (1906), in which he was hampered by copyright restrictions, but he had a much freer hand in The Golden Treasury of Australian Verse (1909), the first anthology of Australasian verse of any importance.
