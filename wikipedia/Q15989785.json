She is Senior Fellow and Visiting Professor at King's College London specialising in the area of cellular, genetic and proteomic studies on patient breast tumour samples, and works within the Breast Cancer Biology Group.  She was the first to identify that the action of interferon type 1 requires the synthesis of effector proteins.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Louis Siminovitch", "response": ["Siminovitch was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Goldie and Nathan Siminovitch, who were Jewish emigrants from Eastern Europe. He won a scholarship in chemistry to McGill University, earning a doctorate in 1944. He then studied at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.

MUC1 is a glycoprotein with extensive O-linked glycosylation of its extracellular domain.  Mucins line the apical surface of epithelial cells in the lungs, stomach, intestines, eyes and several other organs. Mucins protect the body from infection by pathogen binding to oligosaccharides in the extracellular domain, preventing the pathogen from reaching the cell surface. Overexpression of MUC1 is often associated with colon, breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers. Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou identified and characterised the antigen during her work with breast and ovarian tumors."]}]}}
