His later work, starting shortly after his marriage to Margaret Mellis in 1948, is characterised by the use of collage: coloured printed paper layered and mounted on board. Davison remained in relative obscurity until finding recognition in the late 1970s and early 80s. He died in 1984.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Francis Davison (1919\u20131984)"]}, {"page": "Damien Hirst", "response": ["He went to an exhibition of work by Francis Davison, staged by Julian Spalding at the Hayward Gallery in 1983. Davison created abstract collages from torn and cut coloured paper which, Hirst said, \"blew me away\", and which he modelled his own work on for the next two years."]}, {"page": "Margaret Mellis", "response": ["Margaret Nairne Mellis (22 January 1914 \u2013 17 March 2009) was a British artist, one of the early members and last survivors of the group of modernist artists that gathered in St Ives, in Cornwall, in the 1940s. She and her first husband, Adrian Stokes, played an important role in the rise of St Ives as a magnet for artists. She later married Francis Davison, also an artist, and became a mentor to the young Damien Hirst.", "Mellis left the St Ives area in 1946 after the breakdown of her marriage. Mellis and Stokes divorced in 1946, and he subsequently married her younger sister the ceramic artist Ann Stokes. Patrick Heron introduced Mellis to the painter Francis Davison, also recently divorced; they married in 1948 and lived for two years in the run-down Ch\u00e2teau des Enfants on the Cap d'Antibes. They moved to Walberswick in 1950, later moving to a smallholding at Syleham, near Diss. After 25 years of relative isolation and self-sufficiency, broken occasionally by visiting artist friends, then moved to Southwold in 1976, where she began to create driftwood sculptures.", "Francis Davison died from a brain tumour in 1984. Mellis was survived by her son, three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren."]}]}}
