These forces would advance on Port Napoleon with subsequent reinforcement by the main force under General John Abercromby over the following days.

These forces were to gather at Rodriguez in preparation for the invasion.James, Vol. 5, p. 324 The landings themselves were planned by Rowley and Keating, who relied on Willoughby's intimate knowledge of the coastline of Isle de France and a series of careful surveys of the reefs that surrounded the island to select a landing site.James, Vol. 5, p. 325", "The British Army troops attached to the force included sepoys and garrison artillery from Madras and soldiers from the 12th Foot, 14th Foot, 19th Foot, 22nd Foot, 33rd Foot, 56th Foot, 59th Foot, 69th Foot, 84th Foot, 87th Foot, 89th Foot and one troop of the 25th Light Dragoons, commanded by General John Abercromby and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating.Regimental Battle Honours per: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51165/51165-h/51165-h.htm  Also attached was a naval brigade of volunteer sailors and Royal Marines under Captain William Augustus Montagu."]}, {"page": "Action of 18 September 1810", "response": ["The first ship to arrive was HMS Africaine under the Captain Robert Corbet.

Bouvet retired to Grand Port several days later for repairs, and thus was not on blockade duty on 17 September when HMS Ceylon arrived. Ceylon was an unusual ship, constructed by the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) in Bombay as an East Indiaman merchant ship designed to operate as a 32\u2013gun frigate during wartime. In 1805 she was purchased by the British government and commissioned into the Royal Navy for service in the Indian Ocean. In 1810, her commander was Captain Charles Gordon, who had been ordered to sail to Rowley's aid when word of the losses suffered at Grand Port reached Madras. In his haste to depart, Gordon had been unable to obtain any Royal Marines, whose place was taken by 100 men of the 69th Regiment and the 86th Regiment from the Madras garrison.
