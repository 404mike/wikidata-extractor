His most remote band was Fast Breeder, a short-lived late 1970s punk group from Manchester formed by him on drums and Dave Rowbotham on guitar, and managed by Tony Wilson. Wilson called Joyce and Rowbotham to form a band alongside guitarist Vini Reilly and bass guitarist Tony Bowers, The Durutti Column. That line-up released only two songs from Factory's first EP, A Factory Sample, before Joyce. Rowbotham and Bowers quit the band to form another post-punk band around 1979, The Mothmen.\nThe Mothmen released only two studio albums and a number of singles, before disbanding in the 1980s. During his time with The Mothmen, Joyce worked with Pink Military, London Underground and Judy Nylon. By the mid-1980s, he was working with Suns of Arqa, playing drums on their second LP Wadada Magic.  He later formed Simply Red, alongside his bandmate Tony Bowers and singer Mick Hucknall.\nJoyce shares further details of his life and career, up to and beyond his work with Simply Red, in his biography on Chris Joyce School of Drums.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Durutti Column", "response": ["In 1978 Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus, later partners in Factory Records, assembled a band around the remnants of local punk rock band Fast Breeder, drummer Chris Joyce and guitarist Dave Rowbotham.

Despite the 1989 album A New Flame selling over two million copies in the UK alone, frontman Mick Hucknall was keen to develop the sound of the band further. The same year A New Flame was released, a number of dance-orientated records had started to infiltrate the UK singles chart, most notably the songs from the group Soul II Soul. In 2005, when interviewed for the Classic Albums episode on the making of the Stars album, Hucknall commented that he wanted a programmed drum sound that didn't sound synthetic. This led him to working with new musicians, including musician Gota Yashiki whose expertise with drum programming effectively replaced founder drummer Chris Joyce. Producer Stewart Levine also introduced Hucknall to Heitor Pereira which changed the guitar sound on the record, putting more emphasis on rhythm than melody. An early version of the song \"Something Got Me Started\" was premiered in a March 1990 concert in Didsbury, Manchester, whilst the group were promoting A New Flame (later released on the VHS/Laserdisc Let Me Take You Home)."]}, {"page": "The Mothmen", "response": ["The Mothmen were a short-lived post-punk band from England, formed around 1979 by Dave Rowbotham, Chris Joyce and Tony Bowers, shortly after they left The Durutti Column, including ex-Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias singer Bob Harding.", "In 1978, Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus cofounded The Durutti Column, with guitarists Vini Reilly and Dave Rowbotham, bassist Tony Bowers (formerly of Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias), drummer Chris Joyce, and vocalist Phil Rainford.
