Despite contracting polio at the age of eight, he went on to have a lengthy, productive career, performing until the age of 93.  He first studied under his father, William Egerton, and then with George Tyler of the Royal Philharmonic Society.  He was the first British clarinetist to perform Brahms' Clarinet Quintet Op. 115. He was professor at the Royal College of Music in succession to Henry Lazarus from 1894 until 1910, and at Kneller Hall from 1889.  His students included Charles Draper and Haydn Draper.\nWhen Queen Victoria's State and Private Bands were re-organised in 1870, Julian Egerton took over his father's place, at the age of 22 years, a position he held until 1909.  He was, in addition, principal at the Hans Richer Concerts from their inception in 1879, and at many provincial festivals.  He played at the first and many subsequent Promenade Concerts at Queens Hall under Henry J. Wood.\nIn 1910 he gave up both teaching appointments for personal reasons, much to the surprise and regret of the institutions involved.\nIn 1911 his wife Caroline Wakelin, whom he married in 1872, died. Together they had seven children.  He remarried in 1917 and moved shortly after to Bilsington in Kent, where he died, aged 96.\nHis Fieldhouse clarinets are preserved in the Edinburgh Collection of Historic Musical Instruments.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Draper (musician)", "response": ["Draper was born in Odcombe, Somerset.  He came from a musical family, his father and brother, having been cellists and clarinettists, respectively.  In 1888, he studied with Henry Lazarus, and he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music where he continued as a student of Lazarus until the latter's retirement.  He also studied for a year under Julian Egerton.  He premiered Stanford's Clarinet Concerto in 1903 with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra.  Stanford's Clarinet Sonata was also dedicated to Draper.  Draper was also a notable teacher, teaching at the Royal College of Music, Trinity College of Music, and Guildhall School of Music & Drama, and counting Frederick Thurston among his students.  His son, Paul Beaumont Draper, was also an accomplished bassoonist.  Draper died in Surbiton, aged 82."]}, {"page": "List of clarinetists", "response": ["* Julian Egerton"]}, {"page": "Egerton (name)", "response": ["* Julian Egerton (1848\u20131945), British clarinetist"]}]}}
