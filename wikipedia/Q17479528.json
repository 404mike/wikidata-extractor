For a time, Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow owned No.\u00a011 while Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough at No.\u00a012. For a time in the 18th century, the street was the main London residence of Lord Nelson. No.\u00a013 was formed of two separate houses, both leased by John Richmond in 1710 and subsequently joined as a single property. It was bought by Lord Charles Cavendish in 1740 and later occupied by his son, the scientist Henry Cavendish. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet lived at No.\u00a014 from 1754 to 1762. The Byron family were listed as ratepayers of No.\u00a015 during the early 18th century. William Byron, 4th Baron Byron lived here from 1727 until his death in 1736; his widow remained there until 1740. The Baron's son, William Byron, 5th Baron Byron lived here from 1745 to 1774. The Scottish sculptor Thomas Campbell worked here from 1833 to 1843, also taking over the neighbouring No.\u00a016. Sir Lambert Blackwell, 1st Baronet bought No.\u00a016 in September 1709 and stayed there until his death in 1727. His son, Sir Charles Blackwell, 2nd Baronet subsequently lived in the house until he died in 1741. Mary Lepell, maid of honour to Caroline, Princess of Wales (and future wife of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey) lived in part of a house which is now part of No.\u00a034 from around 1716\u20131724. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet, Speaker of the House of Commons lives in No.\u00a041 (now No.\u00a046) from 1747 to 1752.

The monuments are housed in four niches in the specially constructed chancel. The original medieval (probably Norman) chancel was demolished to make way for its construction. The east window is large and of clear glass, flooding the chancel with light to show the white marble monuments at their best. Monuments to John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu (1690\u20131749), and his wife, Mary Churchill (1689\u20131752) are by the renowned sculptor Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac. A third monument to Mary Montagu (1711\u20131775), daughter of John and Mary, is by Pieter Mathias van Gelder (1742\u20131824). These first three monuments are of very high quality, rivalling the Roubilliacs in Westminster Abbey. The fourth monument, to Elizabeth Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch (1743\u20131827), daughter of Mary, is by Thomas Campbell (1790\u20131858) and, though very fine, is of significantly lesser quality than the other three.

Campbell created it in Rome and it was shipped to Britain in 1828. The current position was agreed by the architect in January 1830, and an appropriate plinth was designed to respect the frontage of Dundas House. Although several sources state that the statue was designed for Charlotte Square, there is no evidence of any plans for locating on that site, and Hope's link to the Royal Bank make Dundas House a more obvious first choice."]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"C\"", "response": ["*Thomas Campbell (1790\u20131858), Scottish/English sculptor"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish artists", "response": ["*Thomas Campbell (1790\u20131858), sculptor"]}, {"page": "Patric Park", "response": ["*Bust of Thomas Campbell (1839)"]}, {"page": "John Marshall (Scottish sculptor)", "response": ["He was born in Edinburgh in 1888.
