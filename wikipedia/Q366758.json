Coverdale has maintained that as he was recovering from surgery, Sykes and Mike Stone began conspiring against him by booking studio time and making decisions without his involvement. Stone allegedly suggested bringing in someone else to record Coverdale's vocals. Sykes, meanwhile, has claimed that he and the other band members were systematically fired as soon as they finished recording their respective parts. Neil Murray claimed that Sykes wanted more control over the band, which ultimately led to his departure. Adrian Vandenberg recalled in an interview with Eddie Trunk how Sykes came to the studio to confront Coverdale after being informed he was out of the band. According to Murray, he and Aynsley Dunbar stopped receiving their wages in April 1986, at which point Dunbar immediately left the group. Murray was still officially a member of Whitesnake until January 1987, when he heard Coverdale was putting together a new line-up. With the help of John Kalodner, Coverdale recruited Adrian Vandenberg and Tommy Aldridge, as well as guitarist Vivian Campbell (formerly of Dio) and bassist Rudy Sarzo (formerly of Quiet Riot). This new line-up would appear in all the promotional materials for the forthcoming album. Whitesnake also adopted a new look, akin to glam metal bands of the time, in order to appeal more to American audiences. When asked about the band's makeover, Coverdale responded: \"I'm competing with people like Jon Bon Jovi. I've gotta look the part.\" Due to the prolonged recording process, Coverdale claims to have been three million dollars in debt at the time of the album's release.", "Whitesnake made their live debut following the record's release at the Texxas Jam festival in June 1987.

At the 1988 Brit Awards, the band were nominated for Best British Group, while the album Whitesnake was nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the American Music Awards. When the supporting tour for Whitesnake ended in August 1988, Coverdale informed the rest of the band that the next album would be written by him and Adrian Vandenberg, who had established a fruitful working relationship. After approximately a month of writing, the band regrouped at Lake Tahoe for three weeks of rehearsals. In December 1988, Vivian Campbell parted ways with the band. The official reason given was \"musical differences\". However, Campbell later revealed that his departure was partially due to a falling out between his wife and Tawny Kitaen. This resulted in Campbell's wife being barred from the band's tour. In addition to this, Vandenberg had made it known that he wanted to be the sole guitarist in Whitesnake, which also played into Campbell's departure.", "Whitesnake kicked off the North American leg of The Purple Tour in May 2015.

In August 2017, Whitesnake signed a new distribution deal for North America and Japan with Rhino Entertainment and Warner Music Group. Tentative plans to release a new album the following year were also announced. In October 2017, Whitesnake's eponymous album was reissued as a four-disc box set to commemorate its 30th anniversary.
