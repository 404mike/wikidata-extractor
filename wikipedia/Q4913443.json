He began his career in Scotland before moving to England and then the United States where he played in both the American Soccer League and St. Louis Soccer League.\nWatson began his career in Scotland playing for Ayr United and Vale of Leven F.C. in the early 1920s.  In 1925, he transferred to English club Coventry City F.C. before moving to the United States in 1926.  In the spring of 1928, he signed with the Bethlehem Steel of the American Soccer League at the end of the 1927-1928 season as a replacement for injured Bob MacGregor.  He played only three games with Bethlehem.  He began the 1928-1929 season with the New Bedford Whalers, but was transferred to the Providence Gold Bugs after only three games.  In the spring of 1931, he played for Fall River F.C., but moved to back to the Whalers in the summer.  In 1932, the Whalers defeated Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. (SBF) of the St. Louis Soccer League for the 1932 National Challenge Cup title.  By that time, the ASL was on its last legs and Alex McNab, New Bedford's captain accepted an offer to move west to SBF where he became a player-coach.  He then recruited the core of the New Bedford team, including Watson.  Watson would remain in St. Louis for the remainder of his career.  In 1933, SBF used these new players to win the 1933 National Challenge Cup, repeating as champions in 1934.  The St. Louis teams relied on the sponsorship of local businesses to the extent that they changed names to match their sponsors.  As a result, when the Stix, Baer and Fuller department store sold the rights to the team to St. Louis Central Brewery, the team became known as St. Louis Central Breweries F.C., then the St. Louis Shamrocks in 1935.  Watson remained with the club through these name changes, winning the 1935 National Challenge Cup and finishing runner up in 1936  and 1937.  On 6 February 1938, he signed with South Side Radio, but his teams become obscure after that.  He was still actively playing in 1939 when he was part of a St. Louis All-Stars team which played a Scottish F.A. team touring the United States. and was inducted into the St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame in 1992.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Watson", "response": ["William, Willie, Bill or Billy Watson may refer to:", "* Billy Watson (actor) (born 1923), American actor", "* Billy Watson (footballer, born 1890) (1890\u20131955), English international footballer with Burnley, 1908\u20131925", "* Billy Watson (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u20131962), English footballer with Huddersfield Town, 1912\u20131927", "* Billy Watson (soccer), Scottish-American footballer in the 1920s\u201330s", "* Billy Watson (Scottish footballer) (died 1950), Bradford City A.F.C. footballer, 1921\u20131931", "* Billy Watson (rugby union) (1869\u20131953), member of the 1893 New Zealand rugby union team", "* Billy Watson (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1930s for England, and Keighley", "* Whipper Billy Watson (1915\u20131990), Canadian wrestler"]}, {"page": "Werner Nilsen", "response": ["To make matters more confusing, in summer of 1931 the Yankees moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, merged with Fall River F.C. and became the second team to be named the New Bedford Whalers. Despite the turmoil, Nilsen and his teammates added another \"double\" to their resumes as they took both the 1932 league title and the National Challenge Cup. In league play, Nilsen finished second to ex-teammate Patenaude for the scoring title. The Whalers won the 1932 Challenge Cup title over the St. Louis-based Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C.. Both legs of the cup final were held in St. Louis. The first ended in a 3-3 tie. A week later, Whalers won the game and the title with a 5-2 victory; Nilsen scoring one of the goals. After the games, Whaler's Scottish international Alex McNab decided to join Stix as a player/coach for the 1932\u201333 season. McNab convinced several of his Whalers teammates, including Nilsen, Billy Gonsalves, Bill McPherson and Billy Watson to also make the move west."]}]}}
