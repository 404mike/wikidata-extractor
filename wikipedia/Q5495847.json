In 1886, the trades council passed a resolution permitting political discussions, and it focused increasingly on securing the election of workers to the town council.  That year, it hosted the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in the town, and trades council president Fred Maddison was elected as President of the TUC.  Maddison won a seat on the town council in 1887, but left the town two years later.  In 1891, three trades council-backed candidates won seats as Liberal-Labour candidates.", ":1886: Fred Maddison"]}]}}
