He was famed for his colourful and extrovert personality, which often overshadowed his genuine talent. After fighting in, and surviving the Second World War, he took up motorsport. Although adept in single-seaters, sportscars was where he enjoyed most success, winning the 1953 24 Heures du Mans, two Coupe de Paris events, and the 12 heures internationals Reims race in 1956. He retired in 1958 and ran a garage in Bagshot, Surrey for many years. He died from lung cancer in 1994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 30", "response": ["*1920 \u2013 Duncan Hamilton, Irish-English race car driver and pilot (d. 1994)"]}, {"page": "May 13", "response": ["*1994 \u2013 Duncan Hamilton, Irish-English race car driver (b. 1920)"]}, {"page": "Fleet Air Arm", "response": ["* Duncan Hamilton: English Grand Prix driver and winner of the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans."]}, {"page": "Talbot-Lago", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Duncan Hamilton"]}, {"page": "Jaguar C-Type", "response": ["In 1952, Jaguar, worried by a report about the speed of the Mercedes-Benz 300SLs that would run at Le Mans, modified the C-Type\u2019s aerodynamics to increase the top speed. However, the consequent rearrangement of the cooling system made the cars vulnerable to overheating, and all three retired from the race. The Peter Whitehead-Ian Stewart and Tony Rolt/Duncan Hamilton cars blew head gaskets, and the Stirling Moss-Peter Walker car, the only one not overheating having had a full-sized radiator hurriedly fitted, lost oil pressure after a mechanical breakage. Testing by Norman Dewis at MIRA after the race proved that the overheating was caused more by the revisions to the cooling system than by the altered aerodynamics: the water pump pulley was undersized, so it was spinning too fast and causing cavitation; also the header tank was in front of the passenger-side bulkhead, far from the radiator, and the tubing diameter was too small at 7/8 inch. With the pump pulley enlarged, and the tubing increased to 1 1/4 inch, the problem was eliminated. The main drawback of the new body shape was that it reduced downforce on the tail to the extent that it caused lift and directional instability at speeds over  on the Mulsanne Straight. These cars had chassis numbers XKC 001, 002 and 011. The first two were dismantled at the factory, and the third survives in normal C-type form.", "Duncan Hamilton and Tony Rolt won the race at   \u2013 the first time Le Mans had been won at an average of over ."]}, {"page": "1994 in Ireland", "response": ["*13 May \u2013 Duncan Hamilton, motor racing driver (born 1920)."]}, {"page": "1920 in Ireland", "response": ["*30 April \u2013 Duncan Hamilton, motor racing driver (died 1994)."]}, {"page": "1951 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Duncan Hamilton", "| Duncan Hamilton", "|  Duncan Hamilton", "|  Duncan Hamilton"]}, {"page": "1951 German Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Duncan Hamilton", "| Duncan Hamilton", "|  Duncan Hamilton", "|  Duncan Hamilton"]}, {"page": "1952 British Grand Prix", "response": ["Jean Behra was unable to take part in the British Grand Prix, having broken his shoulder blade at the non-championship Grand Prix de Sables d'Olonne the previous weekend.

The oil led to a wreck involving Gendebien's teammates Collins (taking over for Wolfgang von Trips) and Phil Hill (in the car started by Maurice Trintignant).
