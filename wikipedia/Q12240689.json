In the Qur'an and in later Muslim usage, jihad is commonly followed by the expression fi sabil illah, \"in the path of God.\"For a listing of all appearances in the Qur'an of jihad and related words, see Muhammad Fu'ad 'Abd al-Baqi, Al-Mu\u02bfjam al-Mufahras li-Alfaz al-Qur'an al-Karim (Cairo: Matabi' ash-Sha'b, 1278), pp. 182\u201383; and Hanna E.
