But Manager Kenny Jackett was determined to keep him at Millwall, which he did throughout the summer, and Trotter, himself, was keen to stay. At the start of the 2012\u201313 season, Trotter was given the captaincy in the absence of Danny Shittu and captained the side until November when Shittu returned from the sideline. He then scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20132 loss against Sheffield Wednesday on 25 August 2012, followed up by scoring against Middlesbrough, in a 3\u20131 win. Trotter then scored his third goal of the season, as well as, setting up one of the goal, in a 2\u20132 draw against Burnley on 29 September 2012. Three weeks later on 20 October 2012, he scored his fourth goal of the season against local rivals, Crystal Palace, in a 2\u20132 draw. Trotter then scored two goals in two matches once again this season between 27 October 2012 and 3 November 2012 against Huddersfield Town and Nottingham Forest. He continued to establish himself in the starting eleven for the side, playing in the midfield position and performed impressively since the start of the 2012\u201313 season. Trotter started in every match until he suffered an injury that saw him miss three matches in late\u2013November. It wasn't until on 8 December 2012 when Trotter returned from the starting line-up, in a 3\u20130 loss against Ipswich Town. In a follow\u2013up match against Leicester City, he set up a goal for Chris Taylor, to score the only goal in the game. However, in late\u2013February, he was dropped from the starting line-up for two matches by Manager Kenny Jackett, leading to speculation that the pair fallen out, which he dismissed the claim. Trotter returned to the first team, coming on as a substitute for Josh Wright in the 74th minute, in a 2\u20130 loss against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 5 March 2013. He then suffered a knee injury that kept him out for five matches at the beginning of April. It wasn't until on 30 April 2013 when he returned as a late substitute, in a 0\u20130 draw against local rivals, Crystal Palace. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Trotter went on to make forty\u2013six appearances and scoring six times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Neal Eardley", "response": ["Born in Llandudno, Eardley graduated from the youth system at Oldham Athletic to make his first team debut under Ronnie Moore in a 1\u20131 draw with Scunthorpe United at Boundary Park on 6 May 2006. In the 2006\u201307 season, Eardley became a regular starter under new manager John Sheridan, initially starting in a more attacking role before being shifted to defence. However, his season got off to a rough start, when he was sent off in the opening game on 5 August shortly after teammate Chris Taylor was also red carded, as Oldham lost 1\u20130 to Tranmere Rovers. In September he was given his first professional contract, which was due to run until June 2009. He scored his first goal with a free kick in a 2\u20131 loss at Chesterfield on 9 December. In his first season as a regular starter, Eardley made 41 appearances, scoring twice, as the \"Latics\" qualified for the League One play-offs, but were beaten by Blackpool at the semi-final stage.", "Eardley earned praise from manager Joe Royle in April 2009, but despite missing matches through international call-ups was named in the League One Team of the Year for his performances across his 34 league appearances during the 2008\u201309 campaign, alongside teammate Chris Taylor. However Royle left the club and his successor, Dave Penney, signed cover at right-back in apparent anticipation at losing Eardley during the transfer window."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Assists || Chris Taylor || 6"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["Oldham was at home to face Millwall for their first league game of the 2008\u201309 season. Oldham found themselves down within 1\u20133 early into the second half. After Andy Liddell scored from a penalty kick in the 74th minute, Lewis Alessandra and Chris Taylor scored twice in the final ten minutes to earn Oldham a 4\u20133 victory after being down by two goals. In mid-August, Oldham traveled to Elland Road to face Leeds United. Following a 0\u20130 halftime draw, Chris Taylor scored after a little more than five minutes following the restart. His second came in the 65th minute when he scored from a curler from 18\u00a0yards out from goal\u2014giving Oldham 2\u20130 victory. Following a 2\u20130 victory over Leeds, Oldham was back at Boundary Park to face Cheltenham Town. Lee Hughes would give Oldham their first of the game shortly before halftime whistle. Shortly after the restart, Hughes would score his second of the game before netting his third in the 62nd minute. Danny Whitaker added Oldham's fourth of the game in the 85th minute for a 4\u20130 victory, sending Oldham to top of the table. After an impressive 4\u20130 rout of Cheltenham Town, Oldham was set to face middle-of-the-table Colchester United at Weston Homes Community Stadium. Mark Yeates gave the home side a 1\u20130 lead heading into the break, before grabbing his second in the 63rd minute. But in less than 60 seconds, Chris Taylor scored his 4th of the season to bring Oldham back to 2\u20131 down before Deane Smalley grabbed a goal shortly before full-time\u2014giving Oldham a 2\u20132 draw.", "Oldham dropped to second place in League One following the 2\u20132 draw to start September, and was again on the road as they faced Tranmere Rovers. The only goal came in the 35th minute, when Reuben Hazell headed in a goal after a cross from Neal Eardley. The game was played at a quick pace for most of the day as a total of 10 yellow cards were shown, but Oldham held out for a 1\u20130 win. On 13 September, Oldham was back at home to face 2007\u201308 League Two champions, Milton Keynes Dons. Lee Hughes didn't wait long to get the scoring started as he gave Oldham a 1\u20130 lead by scoring in the 8th minute. Despite seven shots on target, MK Dons could not get a goal past goalkeeper Mark Crossley before Mark Allott grabbed Oldham's second and final goal in the 95th minute. Oldham battled Hartlepool United on 20 September for their seventh league game of the season. Lee Hughes and Chris Taylor gave Oldham a solid 2\u20130 lead heading into the halftime break.

In the 58th minute, Taylor scored Oldham's third of the game as the two teams finished the game with a 3\u20133 draw. Again at home, Oldham faced off against 15th placed local rivals Huddersfield. Ian Craney scored his second in five games, giving the visitors an early 1\u20130 lead in the 29th minute. An Andy Liddell free kick early in the second half would be enough, as the game ended with a 1\u20131 draw.", "After struggling through October, Oldham started November at home against Yeovil Town who was coming off consecutive scoreless draws. It appeared it could have been three consecutive scoreless matches for Yeovil when the two teams were left without goals at halftime. Aaron Brown capitalised from a deep free kick, ending his side's goal drought to give the visitors a 1\u20130 lead. Ex-Oldham player Paul Warne grabbed another goal for the Glovers three minutes later from hesitant play by Neal Eardley. Oldham was unable to get a ball past goalkeeper Asmir Begovi\u0107, who secured a 2\u20130 victory for Yeovil and gave the Latics their first home loss since March 2008. After a 2\u20132 draw in the FA Cup, the Latics faced Northampton Town on 15 November. Oldham had several chances in the first half including a shot by Lee Hughes which was an apparent early goal, though he was flagged by the official for offsides. With a quarter of an hour left in the match, Hughes was cut down in the box to give Andy Liddell a chance to give the Latics a lead. Liddell easily converted on the spot-kick, sending Frank Fielding the wrong way. Despite the 1\u20130 victory, the game ended on a bad note as Hughes was sent off with his second yellow card. At Roots Hall, Southend United was just once beaten in their previous thirteen home games. James Walker tried to help him side continue the streak as he smashed the ball past Mark Crossley from point-blank range for a 1\u20130 Southend advantage. Chris Taylor pulled Oldham back on level terms with a 67th-minute header, before Hughes scored his seventh of the season to give Oldham a 2\u20131 victory. Three days later, Oldham faced off against Walsall at home. Mark Allott started the scoring early, grabbing an early 1\u20130 lead for Oldham from a deflected shot. Michael Ricketts, a former Oldham striker, struck back in 23rd minute with a goal before Alex Nicholls gave the visitors a 2\u20131 advantage. Shortly before the halftime whistle, Hughes scored his 8th goal of the season which put the two sides on level terms at the break. With the game looking like a sure draw, Hughes grabbed another goal in the 89th minute as Oldham moved up to 4th place to end November.", "To begin the final month of 2008, Oldham was at home to play Brighton & Hove Albion. Oldham started the match quickly when Adam Virgo brought down Chris Taylor in the penalty box, allowing Andy Liddell to convert a spot-kick for a 1\u20130 Latics advantage in the 9th minute. However, Steven Thomson slid a ball past the Oldham defence to Glenn Murray who fired a shot into the roof of the net, putting the Seagulls back level at 1\u20131. Adam Virgo, who received a yellow card for his tackle of Taylor, received a second in the 48th minute and was sent off. Despite having only ten men, the Brighton defence frustrated the Latics, holding on for a 1\u20131 draw. A week later, the Latics traveled to face Peterborough United at London Road Stadium. This game was again off to a quick start, however, it was the opposition who struck first. A shot from Aaron McLean in the 12th minute deflected off Latics defender Stefan Stam, giving Peterborough a 1\u20130 lead. Eight minutes before the halftime break, McLean extended the lead with another goal with a rebound from a spot-kick, shortly after having another spot-kick saved by Oldham goalkeeper Greg Fleming. After several comebacks throughout the season, Oldham again showed their intentions when Lee Hughes poked the ball into the opposition's net for a 2\u20131 halftime lead for Peterborough. Just before the hour mark, Hughes again scored when he put a loose ball into the net. With several more chances for both sides, the game ended with a 2\u20132 draw. After two consecutive draws, Oldham was set to face Leyton Orient. Despite early efforts from Danny Whitaker and Darren Byfield, Oldham was unable to net an early goal. A Leyton Orient goal looked possible when Adam Chambers got a rebound twelve yards out, but the midfielder sent the ball high over the net. After Byfield was pulled down in the penalty area by Tamika Mkandawire, Andy Liddell struck his 8th goal of the season via a penalty kick for a 1\u20130 halftime advantage. Near the midway point of the second half, Greg Fleming gave Orient a chance to get back on level terms when he fouled Ryan Jarvis in the box. Fleming saved the penalty, but Jason Demetriou scored from a rebound, earning Leyton Orient a 1\u20131 draw\u2014Oldham's third consecutive. Oldham was away to face Crewe Alexandra under new manager Gudjon Thordarson on Boxing Day. Despite struggling with an illness just days before the match, Darren Byfield was named to the starting lineup. Just before the hour mark in the match, Byfield scored his first for the club from a through back from Kelvin Lomax. The win was secured when Lee Hughes curled a ball past Stuart Tomlinson, before Hughes grabbed another five minutes before the final whistle for a 3\u20130 win. Two days after the Boxing Day victory, Oldham faced off against Carlisle United for the final match of 2008. Terrific play from Carlisle goalkeeper Tim Krul kept Oldham out of goal, despite giving the Latics nineteen corners. Neither side had an attacking threat until 17 minutes in when a Reuben Hazell header forced Krul into a saved shot. With nineteen total shots for the Latics, manager John Sheridan was surprised when the game ended in a scoreless draw.", "In the first round of the 2008\u201309 FA Cup, Oldham was paired against League One side Cheltenham Town. Five minutes into the opening half, Scott Murray for Cheltenham opened the scoring with a strike, getting past goalkeeper Mark Crossley. The Robins gained a 2\u20130 halftime advantage when Lloyd Owusu earned and converted a penalty kick, getting it past the fingertips of Crossley. The Latics got a goal back when Chris Taylor's free kick was deflected by Cheltenham goalkeeper Shane Higgs, with the rebound falling immediately back to Taylor. In the 76th minute, Danny Whitaker equalised the game at 2\u20132 when a deflected shot crept into the corner of the net. A late robins shot from substitute Damian Spencer hit the post at the end of the match, but Oldham held on for a draw\u2014forcing a replay at Boundary Park. In the replay, an early 22nd minute shot from Lewis Montrose proved enough for Cheltenham to advance to the second round, and knock out Oldham for the fourth time in FA Cup history. Despite 17 shots to Cheltenham's three, Oldham could not muster a goal against Scott Brown. Shortly before the halftime break, Oldham was dealt a blow when Deane Smalley picked up an injury\u2014giving Matthew Wolfenden his first senior appearance of the season. Shortly before the final whistle, Kieran Lee almost equalised with a diving header, but the ball rolled past the far post.", "Oldham's 2008\u201309 Carling Cup campaign began at near neighbours Rochdale. Craig Davies picked up his first red card of the season in the 45th minute following a clash with Nathan Stanton.

Neal Eardley, Chris Taylor, and Danny Whitaker converted on penalties to put Oldham up 3\u20131 before Lee Hughes scored the fourth to give Oldham the victory over Rochdale. For their second game, the Latics were once again away\u2014this time to Burnley at Turf Moor, and Greg Fleming made his debut for the club in goal. The visitors found themselves down 1\u20130 early to Burnley after a Chris McCann goal in the 12th minute.
