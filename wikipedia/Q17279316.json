He was returned unopposed in 1835 and 1837, but defeated at the 1841 general election by the Conservative Party candidate William Baird.William Downe Gillon was a major beneficiary of his elder cousin John Gillon's (d. 1809) will, including profits coming from the plantation at Wallhouse, Dominica, housing 137 enslaved people in 1817. This gave Downe Gillon an annuity of \u00a3500 per annum and the purchase of Herstmonceux Castle.", "link_mentions": {}}}
