Westley also gave first team opportunities to players who had progressed through the club's youth system, which included George Boyd. The new squad lost five games of the opening eight games of the club's league season. Following a 4\u20131 home defeat to  part-time Canvey Island, with Stevenage supporters calling for Westley to leave the club, he walked across the pitch to  the East Terrace and told supporters he \"would turn it around\". The team responded with four consecutive victories, and stayed close to the play-offs places. Stevenage went into the final day of the season needing to beat already-relegated Leigh RMI, and had to rely on Tamworth to hold Morecambe, who were currently occupying the final play-off spot. Stevenage beat Leigh 2\u20130, while Tamworth held Morecambe to a goalless draw, ultimately meaning Westley's team had reached the play-offs on the final day of the season. Stevenage overcame second-placed Hereford United 2\u20131 on aggregate, before losing 1\u20130 to Carlisle United at the Britannia Stadium in the final."]}, {"page": "Chris Smith (footballer, born 1981)", "response": ["Smith had a two-match trial with Third Division club York City at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, impressing manager Terry Dolan. With him due to be released by Reading, Smith signed for York on 26 May 2001 on a two-year contract. He made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute for Matt Hocking in a 3\u20132 home defeat against Exeter City on 6 October 2001. Smith made his first start for York in the following match, a 3\u20130 defeat away to Hartlepool United on 13 October 2001, Dolan describing his performance \"as the one bright spot\" from the match. However, following York's 4\u20131 away defeat by Kidderminster Harriers on 23 October 2001, Dolan placed the blame on the team's inexperienced defence. He did not feature in the team again until being recalled for an FA Cup first round 0\u20130 draw away to Colchester United on 17 November 2001. According to the Evening Press, Smith gave a \"near-faultless display\" when York beat his former club Reading 2\u20130 at home in the FA Cup second round on 8 December 2001. He was forced to miss the Christmas period with a virus, which resulted in him losing his place in the team, with Mike Basham, Gary Hobson and Hocking forming solid partnership. After being sent off for the first time in his career in a 3\u20130 defeat away to Rushden & Diamonds on 19 January 2002, he received a one-match suspension. Smith was substituted at half-time in York's 1\u20131 away draw with Halifax Town on 12 February 2002 due to a tight hamstring, returning over two months later in a 3\u20130 home victory over Bristol Rovers on 16 April. Having failed to establish himself as a first-team regular, Smith finished 2001\u201302 with 19 appearances for York."]}]}}
