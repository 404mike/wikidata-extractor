He spent his life in Poplar in the East End, from which his family came, a lifelong supporter of left-wing and Labour causes.  In 1900, he married an Irish woman named Julia Sullivan, who became a prominent politician and campaigner for women's rights, who led a deputation (on behalf of Sylvia Pankhurst) to meet Prime Minister Asquith,  in 1914 and pleaded for suffrage for women supported by the poor working-class men and women of East London . They had two sons and a daughter born within four years. She died in 1927.\nHe was an accountant and active member of Poplar Trades Council (and later served as its president) and was elected as an alderman to Poplar Borough Council in 1919. He served as mayor in 1922\u20131923, vice-chairman (1920\u20131922) and chairman (1922\u20131923) of the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee, and an alderman of London County Council from 1925 to 1929. In 1921, he was imprisoned, along with 29 other Poplar councillors, as a protest against unequal rates.\nIn 1913, when Scurr was Chairman of the London District Committee of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union, he was a last minute socialist candidate at the Chesterfield by-election. \n\nHe contested the 1914 Ipswich by-election, where he finished in third place; as the Conservatives gained the seat from the Liberals.\nAt the 1918 general election, he unsuccessfully contested the Liberal seat of Buckingham, splitting the anti-Tory vote and allowing the Conservatives to win. He was defeated again at the 1922 general election in the Mile End constituency in the East End.\nScurr won the Mile End seat at the 1923 general election, unseating the Conservative MP Sir Walter Preston. He was re-elected in 1924 and 1929, but lost his seat when the Labour Party split at the 1931 general election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Poplar Rates Rebellion", "response": ["* John Scurr"]}, {"page": "Patrick Hastings", "response": ["On 6 August Campbell's house was raided, and he was arrested by the police.

Another Labour backbencher, Jimmy Maxton, rose and asked the Prime Minister \"if he has read the article, and if he is aware that the article contains mainly a call to the troops not to allow themselves to be used in industrial disputes, and that that point of view is shared by a large number of Members sitting on these benches?\"Hyde (1960) p. 143 This statement lead to uproar, and the Speaker was forced to intervene and halt further discussions."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Scurr"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*John Scurr, Mile End, 1923\u201331"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Scurr"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Scurr"]}, {"page": "Mile End (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Scurr"]}, {"page": "No More War Movement", "response": ["The British No More War Movement (NMWM) was founded in 1921 as a pacifist and socialist successor to the No-Conscription Fellowship.Martin Ceadel, Semi-Detached Idealists:The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945.

For the first two years of its existence, it was known as the No More War International Movement. It became the British section of War Resisters International. Chaired by Fenner Brockway, it asked members to strive for revolutionary socialism but not to take part in any war.

The movement also received messages of support from several international figures, including Albert Einstein.Otto Nathan, Heinz Norden, Einstein on Peace. Simon and Schuster, 1960. (p. 91). In 1926, a member proposed the creation of a white poppy, in the manner of the British Legion's red poppies, but with the added meaning of a hope for an end to all wars. The group did not pursue the idea, but it was later taken up by the Women's Co-operative Guild.Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations At its peak, the NMWM numbered around 3000 members, many from the Independent Labour Party. In 1929, several prominent British intellectuals signed a statement, \"Why I Believe in the No More War Movement\", supporting the NMWM's aims.W. J.

Frustrated by the lack of progress on voting rights, in 1907, she became an active member of the more radical WSPU. On 18 November 1910, Anderson joined her mother, Emmeline Pankhurst, Alfred Caldecott, Hertha Ayrton, Mrs Elmy, Hilda Brackenbury, Princess Sophia Duleep Singh, and 300 women to petition Prime Minister Asquith for voting rights. The protest became known as Black Friday, due to the violence and sexual assault the protesters faced from the police and male bystanders. More than one hundred women were arrested, including Anderson, but all were released without charge. In 1912, she was imprisoned in Holloway, briefly, for her suffragette activities which included breaking a window by throwing a brick. In 1914, Anderson joined Agnes Harben and the new group of women and men: H. J. Gillespie, Gerald Gould, Bessie Lansbury and George Lansbury, Mary Neal, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Julia Scurr and John Scurr, Evelyn Sharp, and Edith Ayrton, Louise Eates and Lena Ashwell  in starting the United Suffragists which grew to have branches in London, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Walter Preston (British politician)", "response": ["At the 1918 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Mile End constituency in the East End of London.

This decision caused some disquiet to Labour supporters of Kenyon in the constituency as it now seemed distinctly possible that an official Labour candidate would be put up.The Times, 13 August 1913 They were right to be concerned because on 14 August, just two days before close of nominations, a meeting of trade unionists and socialists in Chesterfield voted to put up John Scurr, Chairman of the London District Committee, Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union to be Labour and Socialist candidate at the by-election. Scurr had fought a Parliamentary election as a socialist before, at South West Bethnal Green in 1911 where he came bottom of the poll by a long margin.The Times, 31.7.11 He was to contest the same seat again in 1914 and he also fought at Ipswich in 1914.
