According to Euphemia, they travelled through southern France together. Innes was already suffering from the tuberculosis that eventually killed him. In 1910 or 1911, with Augustus John, he established a small artistic commune at Nant Ddu cottage in north Wales. Visitors included John and Dorelia, Derwent Lees, Ian Strang, and Euphemia, who Innes painted against the background of Arenig Fawr. It was said that when the relationship was over, Innes buried a silver casket of love letters from Euphemia on the summit of Arenig, the mountain in some way representing the scale of Innes' unrequited love for her.\"Camden Town Group\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.
