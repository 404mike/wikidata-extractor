A tall, physically impressive man, little is known of his early life beyond his matriculation in 1579 at the University of Cambridge, and his marriage in 1591 to Martha Wright.  In 1596 his second cousin once removed, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, appointed him constable of Alnwick Castle and made him responsible for the Percy family's northern estates.  He served the earl in the Low Countries in about 1600\u20131601, and in the years before 1603 was his intermediary in a series of confidential communications with King James VI of Scotland.\nFollowing James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with the new king, who he supposed had reneged on his promises of toleration for English Catholics.  His meeting in June 1603 with Robert Catesby, a religious zealot similarly unimpressed with the new royal dynasty, led the following year to his joining Catesby's conspiracy to kill the king and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder.  Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to certain properties in London, one of which was the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords, in which the gunpowder was finally placed.  The conspirators also planned to instigate an uprising in the Midlands and to simultaneously kidnap James's daughter, Princess Elizabeth.  Percy was to remain in London and secure the capture of her brother, Prince Henry.\nWhen the plot was exposed early on 5 November 1605, Percy immediately fled to the Midlands, catching up with some of the other conspirators en route to Dunchurch in Warwickshire.  Their flight ended on the border of Staffordshire, at Holbeche House, where they were besieged early on 8 November by the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men.  Percy was reportedly killed by the same musketball as Catesby, and was buried nearby.  His body was later exhumed, and his head exhibited outside Parliament. His membership of the plot proved extremely damaging to his patron, the Earl of Northumberland, who although uninvolved was imprisoned in the Tower of London until 1621.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Guy Fawkes", "response": ["One of the conspirators, Thomas Percy, was promoted in June 1604, gaining access to a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe. Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy. The contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession)  claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story may have been a government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel. If the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above. Fawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant's widow was clearing out a nearby undercroft, directly beneath the House of Lords."]}, {"page": "Gunpowder Plot", "response": ["The plan was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605, as the prelude to a popular revolt in the Midlands during which James's nine-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was to be installed as the Catholic head of state. Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters were John and Christopher Wright, Robert and Thomas Wintour, Thomas Percy, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham.  Fawkes, who had 10\u00a0years of military experience fighting in the Spanish Netherlands in the failed suppression of the Dutch Revolt, was given charge of the explosives.", "Wintour travelled to Flanders to enquire about Spanish support.  While there he sought out Guy Fawkes (1570\u20131606), a committed Catholic who had served as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands under the command of William Stanley, and who in 1603 was recommended for a captaincy.  Accompanied by John Wright's brother Christopher, Fawkes had also been a member of the 1603 delegation to the Spanish court pleading for an invasion of England.  Wintour told Fawkes that \"some good frends of his wished his company in Ingland\", and that certain gentlemen \"were uppon a resolution to doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spain healped us nott\".  The two men returned to England late in April 1604, telling Catesby that Spanish support was unlikely.  Thomas Percy, Catesby's friend and John Wright's brother-in-law, was introduced to the plot several weeks later.  Percy had found employment with his kinsman the Earl of Northumberland, and by 1596 was his agent for the family's northern estates.  About 1600\u20131601 he served with his patron in the Low Countries.  At some point during Northumberland's command in the Low Countries, Percy became his agent in his communications with James.  Percy was reputedly a \"serious\" character who had converted to the Catholic faith.  His early years were, according to a Catholic source, marked by a tendency to rely on \"his sword and personal courage\".  Northumberland, although not a Catholic himself, planned to build a strong relationship with James I in order to better the prospects of English Catholics, and to reduce the family disgrace caused by his separation from his wife Martha Wright, a favourite of Elizabeth I.  Thomas Percy's meetings with James seemed to go well.  Percy returned with promises of support for the Catholics, and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses, so as not to cause public offence.  Percy, keen to improve his standing, went further, claiming that the future King would guarantee the safety of English Catholics.", "The first meeting between the five conspirators took place on 20 May 1604, probably at the Duck and Drake Inn, just off the Strand, Thomas Wintour's usual residence when staying in London. Catesby, Thomas Wintour, and John Wright were in attendance, joined by Guy Fawkes and Thomas Percy.  Alone in a private room, the five plotters swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book.  By coincidence, and ignorant of the plot, Father John Gerard (a friend of Catesby's) was celebrating Mass in another room, and the five men subsequently received the Eucharist.", "Although two accounts of the number of searches and their timing exist, according to the King's version, the first search of the buildings in and around Parliament was made on Monday 4 November\u2014as the plotters were busy making their final preparations\u2014by Suffolk, Monteagle, and John Whynniard.  They found a large pile of firewood in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords, accompanied by what they presumed to be a serving man (Fawkes), who told them that the firewood belonged to his master, Thomas Percy.  They left to report their findings, at which time Fawkes also left the building.  The mention of Percy's name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator.  The King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken.  Late that night, the search party, headed by Thomas Knyvet, returned to the undercroft.  They again found Fawkes, dressed in a cloak and hat, and wearing boots and spurs.  He was arrested, whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson.  He was carrying a lantern now held in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a search of his person revealed a pocket watch, several slow matches and touchwood.  36 barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of faggots and coal.  Fawkes was taken to the King early on the morning of 5 November.", "As news of \"John Johnson's\" arrest spread among the plotters still in London, most fled northwest, along Watling Street.  Christopher Wright and Thomas Percy left together.  Rookwood left soon after, and managed to cover 30\u00a0miles in two hours on one horse.  He overtook Keyes, who had set off earlier, then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill, before catching Catesby, John Wright, and Bates on the same road.  Reunited, the group continued northwest to Dunchurch, using horses provided by Digby.  Keyes went to Mordaunt's house at Drayton.  Meanwhile, Thomas Wintour stayed in London, and even went to Westminster to see what was happening. When he realised the plot had been uncovered, he took his horse and made for his sister's house at Norbrook, before continuing to Huddington Court.", "In London, news of the plot was spreading, and the authorities set extra guards on the city gates, closed the ports, and protected the house of the Spanish Ambassador, which was surrounded by an angry mob.  An arrest warrant was issued against Thomas Percy, and his patron, the Earl of Northumberland, was placed under house arrest. In \"John Johnson's\" initial interrogation he revealed nothing other than the name of his mother, and that he was from Yorkshire.  A letter to Guy Fawkes was discovered on his person, but he claimed that name was one of his aliases.  Far from denying his intentions, \"Johnson\" stated that it had been his purpose to destroy the King and Parliament.  Nevertheless, he maintained his composure and insisted that he had acted alone.  His unwillingness to yield so impressed the King that he described him as possessing \"a Roman resolution\".", "Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, was in a difficult position.  His midday dinner with Thomas Percy on 4 November was damning evidence against him, and after Thomas Percy's death there was nobody who could either implicate him or clear him.  The Privy Council suspected that Northumberland would have been Princess Elizabeth's protector had the plot succeeded, but there was insufficient evidence to convict him.  Northumberland remained in the Tower and on 27 June 1606 was finally charged with contempt.  He was stripped of all public offices, fined \u00a330,000 (about \u00a3 in ), and kept in the Tower until June 1621.  The Lords Mordaunt and Stourton were tried in the Star Chamber. They were condemned to imprisonment in the Tower, where they remained until 1608, when they were transferred to the Fleet Prison.  Both were also given significant fines."]}, {"page": "Robert Catesby", "response": ["The Protestant James I, who became King of England in 1603, was less tolerant of Catholicism than his followers had hoped. Catesby therefore planned to kill him by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder during the State Opening of Parliament, the prelude to a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the English throne. Early in 1604 he began to recruit other Catholics to his cause, including Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy, and the charismatic and influential Guy Fawkes. Over the following months Fawkes helped to bring a further eight conspirators into the plot, which was planned to be carried out on 5 November 1605. A letter sent anonymously to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, alerted the authorities, and on the eve of the planned explosion, during a search of Parliament, Fawkes was found guarding the barrels of gunpowder. News of his arrest caused the other plotters to flee London, warning Catesby along their way.", "Despite the ease with which Catesby seems to have inspired his fellow conspirators, that it was he and not Fawkes (today most often associated with 5 November) who devised what became known as the Gunpowder Plot, has largely been forgotten. The precise date on which he set events in motion is unknown, but the first likely had the idea early in 1604. Sometime around June of the previous year he was visited by his friend Thomas Percy. A great-grandson of the 4th Earl of Northumberland, Percy was reported to have had a \"wild youth\" before he became a Catholic, and during Elizabeth's final years had been entrusted by the 9th Earl with a secret mission to James's court in Scotland, to plead with the king on behalf of England's Catholics. He now complained bitterly about what he considered to be James's treachery and threatened to kill him. Catesby replied, \"No, no, Tom, thou shalt not venture to small purpose, but if thou wilt is a traitor thou shalt be to some great advantage.\" Percy listened while Catesby added, \"I am thinking of the surest way and I will soon let thee know what it is.\" During Allhallowtide on 31 October he sent for his cousin Thomas Wintour, who was at Huddington Court in Worcestershire with his brother Robert. Thomas was educated as a lawyer and had fought for England in the Low Countries, but in 1600 had converted to Catholicism. Following the Earl of Essex's failed rebellion, he had travelled to Spain to raise support for English Catholics, a mission which the authorities would later describe as comprising part of a 'Spanish Treason'. Although Thomas declined his invitation, Catesby again invited him in February the next year.", "On Sunday 20 May in the well-to-do Strand district of London, Catesby met Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy and Guy Fawkes, at an inn called the Duck and Drake. Percy had been introduced to the plot several weeks after Wintour and Fawkes's return to England.  Alone in a private room, all swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book, and then in another room celebrated Mass with the Jesuit priest (and friend to Catesby) John Gerard. Robert Keyes was admitted to the group in October 1604, and was charged with looking after Catesby's Lambeth house, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored. Two months later Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became aware of it, and by March 1605 three more were admitted: Thomas Wintour's brother Robert, John Grant and John Wright's brother Christopher."]}, {"page": "Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland", "response": ["*Sir Josceline Percy, Baron Beverley (1480\u20131532), who married Margaret Frost.

The following day, members of the Privy Council visited James to inform him that a search would be made of the Houses of Parliament, \"both above and below\". Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain.  Fellow plotter Thomas Percy said he was ready to \"abide the uttermost trial\", and subsequently on 4 November Catesby and several others left London for the Midlands to prepare for the planned uprising.", "Although at first he was uncooperative, on 13 November Tresham confessed to being involved in the plot, outlining his version of events to his interrogators.  Moving his family from the safety of Rushton was, he pointed out, not the action of a man who believed he was taking them into \"the very mouth and fury\" of the plot. He admitted to the government that he was guilty only of the plot's concealment, denying that he had ever been an active member of the conspiracy, although by the end of the month he had also admitted his involvement in the Spanish Treason of 1602\u20131603. He claimed to have persuaded Thomas Wintour and Thomas Percy to postpone the explosion, and that he had planned to inform the king's secretary Thomas Lake of a \"Puritan conspiracy\".

He asked if Catesby had spoken of the matter with Garnet, or any other Jesuits; although Catesby was in no doubt that the Jesuits disapproved of any such action, he lied and said that he would not act without their approbation. Catesby then named the other conspirators, and promised Digby that as soon as they reached Gayhurst he would demonstrate that their religion allowed such acts of regicide, thus dissuading the young lord from confessing to Garnet and discovering the Jesuit's opinion of the matter.

While Digby was taken to the Tower of London, Gayhurst was ransacked; the servants' belongings were stolen, the livestock was sold cheaply, and Mary Digby was left destitute.

Wintour also met with Welsh spy Hugh Owen, who introduced him to Guy Fawkes, a man with whose name Catesby was familiar.  A fifth conspirator, Thomas Percy, joined them several weeks later.  Percy was related to the Wright family by marriage, having wed John's sister, Martha.  The group met on 20 May 1604 at the Duck and Drake inn, in the fashionable Strand district of London.  After the meeting they swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book and celebrated Mass in another room with Father John Gerard, who was ignorant of their purpose.", "As news of Fawkes's capture spread, particularly through the great houses of the Strand, Christopher deduced what had occurred and went to Thomas Wintour at the Duck and Drake inn, exclaiming \"the matter is discovered\".  Wintour ordered him to verify the news, and on confirming that the government were seeking Thomas Percy (for whom Fawkes, using the alias \"John Johnson\", claimed to be working), ordered him to alert Percy. Christopher and Percy left London together, heading for Dunstable.", "Their younger sister, Alice Wright, the wife of William Redshaw, had sought to be a nurse to Princess Mary, and was lodged in the Strand. She was suspected of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot by Sir Edward Hoby and Thomas Posthumous Hoby who wrote to Cecil about her on 26 November 1605, noting she was a friend of Thomas Percy.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 17 (London, 1938), pp. 514-5."]}, {"page": "Robert Keyes", "response": ["The Jesuit priest John Gerard described Keyes as \"a grave and sober man, and of great wit and sufficiency\". Father Oswald Tesimond claimed that Keyes had \"tasted persecution himself, having lost his goods because of it\" while historian and author Cyril Northcote Parkinson's image of him was of a \"desperate man, ruined and indebted\". Tall, with a red beard, despite his relative poverty Catesby declared him \"a trusty honest man\", and may have paid him for his services. Like fellow plotter Guy Fawkes, he was thought capable of looking after himself.  Several conspirators expressed concerns about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be at Parliament on the day of the planned explosion; Keyes was particularly worried about Lord Mordaunt, his wife's employer. Thomas Percy was concerned for his patron, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, and the Lords Vaux, Montague, Monteagle and Stourton were also mentioned.  Keyes's suggestion to warn Lord Mordaunt was treated by Catesby with derision, when he answered that \"he would not for the chamber full of diamonds acquaint him with the secret, for that he knew he could not keep it.\""]}, {"page": "Gunpowder, Treason & Plot", "response": ["* Richard Harrington as Thomas Percy in episode 2"]}, {"page": "Thomas Bates", "response": ["The last details of the plot were finalised in October.  Guy Fawkes would light the fuse and then escape across the Thames, while simultaneously a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth. Late on Monday 4 November, Bates set out with Catesby and John Wright for the planned revolt.  The following day while at Dunstable re-shoeing Catesby's horse, they were met by Rookwood, who delivered the devastating news that Fawkes had been discovered guarding the gunpowder and arrested.  As those conspirators still in London fled the city, the group soon integrated Christopher Wright and Thomas Percy.  They rode toward Dunchurch, on horses sent from Everard Digby by prearrangement.  They met Robert Wintour (brother to Thomas) at Ashby St Ledgers, and Digby at Dunchurch. On 6 November they stole horses from Warwick Castle, and collected stored weapons from Norbrook, near Stratford-upon-Avon.  As they continued toward Huddington, and as the government issued a proclamation for the fugitives' arrest (Catesby's servant was listed as Robert Ashfield, probably a mistake for Bates), Catesby ordered Bates to deliver a letter to Father Garnet at Coughton Court, asking for his support.  Bates's news proved momentous for the Jesuits; he overheard Tesimond exclaim \"we are all utterly undone\".  Garnet's reply to Catesby begged them to stop their \"wicked actions\", and to listen to the pope's teachings."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Trevannion", "response": ["Several Scottish servants came south with the Prince from Dunfermline, including his laundry-woman Agnes Fortune and the elder George Kirke.Frederick Devon, Issues of the Exchequer (London, 1836), p. 38: Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), pp. 111-2 In 1605 Agnes Fortune testified that one of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators Thomas Percy had asked her questions about Charles' lodging at Whitehall Palace and his activities.
