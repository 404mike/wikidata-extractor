Since then it has been argued that other buildings like Lessay Abbey in northwest France provided the early experimental ribs that created the high technical level shown in Durham. There is evidence in the clerestory walls of the choir that the high vault had ribs. There is controversy between John James and Malcolm Thurlby on whether these rib vaults were four-part or six-part, which remains unresolved."]}, {"page": "1856 in architecture", "response": ["* September 23 \u2013 John Bilson, English architect and architectural historian (died 1943)"]}, {"page": "John Bilson", "response": ["John Bilson may refer to:", "*John Bilson (politician), Ghanaian politician and doctor", "*John Bilson (architect) (1856\u20131943), British architect and architectural historian"]}, {"page": "Howden Minster", "response": ["The break between Canon John's work and the next phase is easily discerned, as the tracery patterns change completely and the elements are no longer encircled. The aisle windows are all of three lights, and alternate on both sides between pointed trefoils (some of them inverted) stacked over the lights, and intersecting Y-tracery with pointed trefoils and turned quatrefoils in the interstices. These motifs support John Bilson\u2019s claim that the nave was built from 1280 onward. The nave is six bays long and the nave arcades are higher than those of the transept, the capitals changing from round with octagonal abaci to octagonal throughout. It is obvious from the lower roofline above the western crossing arch that a clerestory was not originally employed. But a clerestory was introduced in the second campaign, though it is rather low in comparison with the arcades. There are two clerestory windows to each bay, with a rounded quatrefoil over two pointed-trefoil lights in each window. These open into the church through two corresponding arches with continuous mouldings, and there is a passage in the thickness of the wall."]}, {"page": "William Botterill and Son", "response": ["The practice was founded by William Botterill (1820\u20131903), who worked with his son William Henry Botterill (1851\u201379), and after 1881 with John Bilson (1858\u20131943) as Botterill and Bilson.", "William Botterill came to Hull in 1848 as clerk of works for the new Royal Station Hotel and set up an architectural practice in 1851.
