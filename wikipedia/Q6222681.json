Per the 1900 reference work British music publishers, printers and engravers: London, provincial, Scottish, and Irish: From Queen Elizabeth's reign to George the Fourth's, with select bibliographical lists of musical works printed and published within that period:\n\nBowie & Hill. The senior partner was John Bowie, a Perth musician, who, as Mr. Glen points out in his \"Scottish Dance Music,\" entered into business with T. Hill, in 1803, at a shop in George Street. John Bowie died in 1815, but Mr. Glen quotes an advertisement showing that Hill continued the business alone. Bowie & Hill do not appear to have published very largely. One sheet in my own library is \"Four New Tunes, for the pianoforte or violin, published by John Bowie, with the permission of the different composers, Edinburgh, printed for and sold by Bowie & Hill, music sellers, Perth\" ; it contains a waltz, with the statement that it was danced on June 1st, 1803.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queen Mary Harp", "response": ["The Queen Mary Harp dates from 1500 and was presented to the harper Beatrix Gardyn of Banchory in 1563 by Mary, Queen of Scots, while on a hunting trip. It is also said to have been adorned at one time with a gold portrait of Mary which is why the harp is associated with the queen of Scots and was subsequently passed down into the Robertson family of Lude, in Perthshire. Lady Gardyn's son had a servant in 1588 called Anthony McEwan McChlairser (\"son of the harper\"), which provides a clue as to who might have played this clarsach. The last harpist to play the instrument is noted as John Robertson of Lude (died c. 1729); his repertory was preserved in the family and published by John Bowie in 1789. All three surviving Gaelic harps are considered to have been made in Argyll in South-West Scotland at some time in the 14th or 15th centuries."]}, {"page": "John Bowie", "response": ["John Bowie may refer to:", "*John Bowie (American football) (born 1984), American football player", "*John Bowie (), prisoner on the ship St. Michael of Scarborough", "*John Bowie Sr. (1688\u20131759), Scottish-born colonist in Maryland", "*John Bowie (publisher) (died 1815), Scottish musician and music publisher"]}]}}
