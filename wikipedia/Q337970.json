Maginnis won and held the seat for the UUP for the next eighteen years until he retired. By this point boundary changes had resulted in a broad 50:50 balance between unionists and nationalists and it was expected that a single unionist candidate would hold the seat in the 2001 general election. James Cooper was nominated by the UUP. On this occasion, however, both the nationalist and unionist votes were to be split. Initially, Maurice Morrow of the DUP was nominated to stand, with the DUP fiercely opposing the UUP's support for the Good Friday Agreement. Morrow then withdrew in favour of Jim Dixon, a survivor of the Enniskillen bombing who stood as an Independent Unionist opposed to the Agreement. Tommy Gallagher of the SDLP ran, but his intervention did not do enough damage to Sinn F\u00e9in. Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle Gildernew won by 53 votes over Cooper. Subsequently, the result was challenged amid allegations that a polling station had been kept open by force for longer than the deadline, allowing more people to vote, but the courts\u2014while conceding that this happened\u2014did not uphold the challenge, because it held that the votes cast after the legal closing time would not have affected the outcome.Court told of UUP claim of polling irregularities The Free Library, 18 September 2001", "In the election of May 2015 Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle Gildernew lost the seat to the UUP's candidate Tom Elliott.
