Vic Couling, the president at the time, had applied for Headington to become a member of a new Second Division in the Southern League.Howland p.37. Other teams that applied included Weymouth, Kettering Town and future league side Cambridge United. Although the plans were postponed, the First Division was going to be expanded by two clubs; Weymouth and Headington were elected. It was later discovered that Llanelli had just one vote fewer than Headington.  Oxford played its first season in the Southern League in 1949, the same year they turned professional. Former First Division forward Harry Thompson was hired as manager. In 1950, Headington United became the first professional club in Britain to install floodlights,The Official 1986 Milk Cup Final Programme, p.19. and used them on 18 December against Banbury Spencer.Howland p.41. They initially played in orange and blue shirts, but changed to yellow home shirts for the 1957\u201358 season. The reason for the change is unknown. In 1960, Headington United was renamed Oxford United, to give the club a higher profile.", "The first manager appointed was Harry Thompson in July 1949, soon after the club turned professional. In a nine-year spell he led the team to the Southern League title in 1953, as well as the Southern League Cup in 1953 and 1954. He was replaced by Arthur Turner in 1958, who would become the longest-serving manager in the club's history, serving more than a decade in charge. Turner led United to back-to-back Southern League titles, of which the second, in 1962, resulted in their election to the Football League. Promotion followed from the Fourth Division in 1965, and the club was crowned Third Division champions three years later. Turner left the club nine months after this success. Over the next thirteen years, five managers took charge. Ron Saunders was in charge for only a dozen games, moving to Norwich City at the end of the 1968\u201369 season. Gerry Summers was manager for six years, before being replaced by Mick Brown. During Brown's four-year run, United were relegated back to the Third Division after spending eight years in the Second."]}, {"page": "2000 in association football", "response": ["* January 29 \u2013 Harry Thompson, English footballer (born 1915)"]}, {"page": "List of Oxford United F.C. managers", "response": ["The following is a list of Oxford United Football Club managers from 1949, when the club turned professional, to the present day.
