His career included periods playing for and later managing the England national team and being a UEFA Cup-winning manager at Ipswich Town.\nRobson's professional playing career as an inside forward spanned nearly 20 years, during which he played for three clubs: Fulham, West Bromwich Albion, and, briefly, Vancouver Royals. He also made 20 appearances for England, scoring four goals. After his playing career, he found success as both a club and international manager, winning league championships in both the Netherlands and Portugal, earning trophies in England and Spain, and taking England to the semi-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, which remained the national team's best run in a World Cup since 1966 until they reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup. His last management role was as a mentor to the manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, while his final official club job was at boyhood club Newcastle United, whom he left in 2004. He held several managerial positions outside of England, most notably one year at Barcelona in 1996\u201397, as well as stints at PSV, Sporting CP and Porto.\nRobson was created a Knight Bachelor in 2002, was inducted as a member of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003, and was the honorary president of Ipswich Town F.C. From 1991 onwards, he suffered recurrent medical problems with cancer, and in March 2008, put his name and efforts into the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, a cancer research charity which has so far raised over \u00a312 million (March 2018). In August 2008, his lung cancer was confirmed to be terminal; he said, \"My condition is described as static and has not altered since my last bout of chemotherapy... I am going to die sooner rather than later.

Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager.

He gathered around him a cadre of young FA staff coaches: men like Bill Nicholson, Don Howe, Alan Brown, Ron Greenwood, Dave Sexton, Malcolm Allison, Joe Mercer, Vic Buckingham, Jimmy Hill and Bobby Robson.

Dalglish was replaced as manager early in the following season by Ruud Gullit. The club once again finished 13th in the league and lost the 1999 FA Cup Final.

Despite Gullit giving Shearer the captain's armband, reports of a rift between club captain and manager were rife, Gullit's decision to drop Shearer proved deeply unpopular with fans and his departure capped a dismal start to the season. The animosity between Shearer and Gullit was later confirmed by the latter, who reported telling the striker that he was \"...the most overrated player I have ever seen.\" Ironically, Robson had tried to sign Shearer for Barcelona in 1997, making a bid of \u00a320million which would have seen Shearer break the world's transfer fee record for the second time in 12 months.

Speaking to The New York Times regarding Ronaldo later that season, Robson said \"I don't think I've ever seen a player at 20 have so much\".", "His coach at Barcelona, Bobby Robson, commented: \"Ronaldo could start from the halfway line and the whole stadium would ignite. He was the fastest thing I've ever seen running with the ball. Had he managed to stay free of injury, he had every chance of becoming the best footballer ever.\" In one on one situations, Ronaldo often used elaborate feints to trick and beat defenders and goalkeepers; he popularised the use of many football tricks and skills, such as the elastico and the step over.

In 1989, after Koeman left, PSV ended second in the league, but won the KNVB Cup after defeating Vitesse (1\u20130). Hiddink left the team in 1990, to be replaced by Bobby Robson.

Robson had frequent clashes with Rom\u00e1rio, but the striker never changed his ways. These events, in addition to the lack of European success, meant that Robson was let go in 1992. While Gerets retired, Hans Westerhof took over as coach, but only won the Super Cup in his single season at the helm. In 1993, Rom\u00e1rio was transferred to Barcelona.
