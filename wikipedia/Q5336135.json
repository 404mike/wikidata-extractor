He entered management the following year, taking charge of a Bournemouth side facing relegation to the Conference National in January 2009 as the youngest manager in the Football League. Under his guidance, Bournemouth were able to survive relegation during his first season in charge, having started the season on minus 17 points, and were promoted to League One the following campaign. \nAfter a brief spell as manager at Burnley, Howe returned to Bournemouth and led them to two further promotions in three seasons, taking them to the top division of English football. He was subsequently named Football League Manager of the Decade in 2015 following three promotions in a seven-year period. Bournemouth survived in the Premier League for five seasons under Howe, before suffering relegation to the Championship in 2020. He resigned as manager of Bournemouth after the club's relegation. At the time of his departure, Howe was the longest serving manager in the Premier League.

The sketch is a light hearted take on the way Americans take \"Soccer\" and expressions used, phrases were coined in a similar way to the previous Boston Goals sketch as Fenners who had played \"Mike Schweinberger\" also played Bobley. The theme was the \"Brad Bobley Soccer Camp\" and each week he would show participants how to execute a variety of different football skills such as Penalties, Free Kicks and challenges. The segment would often feature Bobley lambasting and swearing at Rocket and hitting him over the head with his clipboard. He coined the phrase \"Megnuts, so sweet\" in reference to a \"Nutmeg\". The real Bradley was dismissed after only a few months in the Swansea job, but Soccer AM continued with the Brad Bobley character for the rest of the 2016\u201317 season.
