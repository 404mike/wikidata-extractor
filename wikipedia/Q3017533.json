At the championships Rutherford failed to reach the final, finishing 14th in the qualifying round on 14 August with a jump of 7.87m. In the autumn of 2013 Rutherford appointed Jonas Tawiah-Dodoo as his coach. Tawiah-Dodoo also coaches 100m 2013 European Junior Champion Chijindu Ujah and 200m 2011 European Junior Champion David Bolarinwa.
