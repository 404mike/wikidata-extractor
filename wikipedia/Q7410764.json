A cyberconversion process begins on all of Earth's dead. Missy offers the Doctor control of the Cybermen army so they can rule the universe together, but her plan is foiled when Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson), the cyber-converted boyfriend of the Doctor's companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), resists his programming and destroys himself along with all the other Cybermen. Cybermen are next seen in \"Face the Raven\" (2015), among the various alien refugees hiding in London, and in series finale \"Hell Bent\", in which a rusted Cyberman is imprisoned in the Cloisters of Gallifrey. The origin of the Cybermen of Mondas is told in the two-part Series 10 finale \"World Enough and Time\" and \"The Doctor Falls\", when a Mondasian colony ship is stuck escaping the gravity of a black hole for many years. The human-like Mondasians, assisted unknowingly by the Master (John Simm), begin upgrading their population to adapt to life aboard the decaying ship. The Doctor reflects on all the societies that have created Cybermen and concludes that the Cybermen is an example of parallel evolution: a concept that is waiting to impose itself on human-like species across the universe. Ultimately, this encounter with the Cybermen proves brutal: the Doctor's companion Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) is cyberconverted; two incarnations of the Master (Simm and Gomez) kill one another in a disagreement over standing alongside the Doctor; and the Doctor's companion Nardole (Matt Lucas) is left behind on the ship to look after human colonists, for whom inevitable cyberconversion has been delayed but not averted, though the Doctor manages to destroy most of the Cybermen in a massive explosion. The Doctor, exhausted and wounded to a point of nearing death, awakens in his TARDIS and begins to regenerate. At the same time, the cyberconverted Bill is saved by her old flame Heather who turns her into the same sort of being Heather became after being infected by a sentient liquid."]}, {"page": "Coal Hill School", "response": ["In the 2014 series of Doctor Who, Coal Hill School became a recurring location.

At the same time, the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) is attempting to explore the possibility that everyone has a constant companion, like a shadow, that is always with them, relating back to the recurring dream of the monster under the bed. Wanting to explore Clara's past experience of the dream, the TARDIS taps into her mind to return to her childhood but, as she is distracted by Danny, it takes them back to a children's home in Gloucester where they meet Danny as a child, whose real name is actually Rupert. Clara inadvertently inspires him to be a soldier.  She then returns to the present and goes back to the date immediately after she stormed out. She attempts to reconcile things with Danny, but he becomes suspicious when she reveals she knows his real name. This time, he storms out. Clara is then stunned when the Doctor takes her to meet Orson Pink, a time traveller from 100 years in the future who has become stranded at the end of the universe. Orson bears a striking resemblance to Danny (both are played by Samuel Anderson). Clara realises that Orson is Danny's descendant, and she contemplates the idea that he is also hers after he remarks that he is descended from a time traveller. Realising that her future lies with Danny, she visits him and they reconcile by sharing their first kiss.", "On 24 February 2014, Samuel Anderson was announced that he has been cast alongside Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Capaldi's first series as Danny Pink, a teacher at Coal Hill School alongside companion Clara Oswald. Coal Hill School was the workplace of original companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. Following 2013's 50th anniversary celebrations, head writer Steven Moffat decided that he would bring in another teacher to work alongside Clara in exploring the school's roots. Anderson said that he was \"excited\" about joining the show, and could not wait to see how his character would be involved with the Doctor and Clara. Despite it not being confirmed until shortly before Series 8's airing, it was commonly speculated that Anderson would be playing Clara's love interest. Coleman and Anderson had previously closely worked together on the ITV soap opera Emmerdale, where they played Jasmine Thomas and Ross Kirk respectively."]}]}}
