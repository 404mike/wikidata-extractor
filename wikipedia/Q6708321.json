Her work principally tries to negotiate and transcend established ideas of theatricality and aesthetics.  As such, her work typically manifests itself through either its destruction or impermanence and in spaces that would not properly be considered stages and with non-typical \u2018actors\u2019 in chaotic interactions.\nLyn has written, produced and directed a 9-hour performance piece \u2018Letter to Daddy\u2019 based\nupon principles of exhaustion and repetition which used four scenes from the film \u2018Whatever\nhappened to Baby Jane?\u2019 as well as written a novel \u2018There\u2019s No Place Like Home\u2019 about the\nlast day in an asylum for the Surrealist playwright Antonin Artaud. Her current work is the Cat\nand Mouse in 0g that situates the animals as actors in a staged environment of a parabolic aeroplane.  The flight took place at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City, Russia on 8 July 2008.  The piece formed through their reactions to one another and the environment over the repeated parabolas and states of weightlessness.After interest from a project scientist at ESA, she is simultaneously beginning to structure a\nproject that may see art on Mars for the next ExoMars Rover mission. Her\nsuggestion is to choreograph a dance for the robot on Mars for when the scientific mission is\nover using its autonomous navigation system.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of performance artists", "response": ["*Lyn Hagan"]}, {"page": "Hagan (surname)", "response": ["*Lyn Hagan, British writer and artist"]}]}}
