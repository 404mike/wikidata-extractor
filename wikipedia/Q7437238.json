In the closing month of the season Shearer was being picked ahead of Mackenzie but (due to an agreement made prior to his loan signing) was not allowed to play against his parent-club Bristol Rovers in the League Two play-off final. At the age of 35, MacKenzie subsequently got his chance to line up at Wembley for the first time, though Shrewsbury succumbed to a 3\u20131 defeat."]}, {"page": "Jabo Ibehre", "response": ["Ibehre came off the bench at half-time on 31 January to bag himself a brace in a 3\u20133 draw with Bristol Rovers. He scored 90 seconds after his introduction, striking the ball home from ten yards, before lobbing Pirates goalkeeper Scott Shearer ten minutes later for his second goal. Ibehre's eight goals in 38 appearances helped the O's to automatic promotion to League One on the final day of the league season, beating Oxford United 3\u20132 at the Kassam Stadium and sending their opposition out of the Football League. After the season came to a close and with his contract expiring, he made it known to manager Martin Ling that he wanted to stay and sign a new contract and play at a higher level in League One.

After playing in Shrewsbury's first six league matches he was dropped in favour of Chris Mackenzie. Whilst playing in a reserve fixture on 18 September 2006, Esson sustained a broken cheekbone, and it was later revealed that he would be sidelined for up to ten weeks. Scott Shearer was signed on loan from Bristol Rovers to cover Esson's injury spell. Upon his recovery, Esson could not dislodge him from the first team, and Shearer played out the rest of the season as first choice goalkeeper. In the League Two play-off final, Shearer was prohibited from playing against his parent club, Bristol Rovers; Chris Mackenzie, who had played more league games that season, was chosen ahead of Esson for the match."]}, {"page": "Adam Murray", "response": ["The club underwent a rebuild of the squad for the 2015\u201316 season, with 15 new players arriving at the club.

A positive start saw the team win six and draw four of their opening 12 games to sit fourth in the table in October.
