Violet Alford, a prominent student of folklore and folk dance, wrote in 1940 that the dance had previously taken place on the Twelfth Day, during the first week of January. According to Robert Plot, it has also been performed on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, in addition to the local Wakes Monday, though upon its revival in 1660 it was confined to the latter alone."]}, {"page": "Marshfield, Gloucestershire", "response": ["There is evidence of mummers' plays since circa 1141. The Marshfield play was discontinued in the 1880s when a number of the players died of influenza but it was resurrected after the Second World War. In the past centuries the mummers were probably a band of villagers who toured the large houses to collect money for their own Christmas festivities. During the latter half of the 19th century the play lapsed, presumably for lack of interest. The play was not entirely forgotten however. Then, in 1931, the Reverend Alford, vicar of Marshfield, heard his gardener mumbling the words 'Room, room, a gallant room, I say' and discovered that this line was part of a mummers' play. The vicar's sister Violet Alford, a leading folklorist, encouraged the survivors of the troupe and some new members, including Tom Robinson (whose place was later taken by his brother), to revive the tradition. There was some dispute between Miss Alford and the elderly villagers as to how the play should actually be performed, and the resulting revival was a compromise which differs in several respects from other versions: St George has apparently become King William and Father Christmas appears as an extra character. The costumes, as well as the play's symbolism, are relics of an ancient and obscure original- perhaps the earliest performers were clad in leaves or skins, symbolizing the death and rebirth of nature."]}, {"page": "Farandole", "response": ["The Farandole was first described in detail by the English folklorist Violet Alford in 1932.Violet Alford (1932): The Farandole. Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society 1: 18\u201333. The following description is from the county of Nice:\"Traditionally led by the abbat-mage holding a ribboned halberd, the dancers hold hands and skip at every beat; strong beats on one foot, alternating left and right, with the other foot in the air, and weak beats with both feet together. In the village of Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, on the occasion of the festival honouring patron Saint Blaise, the most recently married couple leads the dance.\"Musically, the dance is in  time, with a with a strongly accentuated rhythm, moderate to fast tempo, and played by a flute and drum. Another description of this dance comes from Grove's dictionary,\"The Farandole consists of a long string of young men and women, sometimes as many as a hundred in number, holding one another by the hands, or by ribbons or handkerchiefs. The leader is always a bachelor, and he is preceded by one or more musicians playing the galoubet, i.e. a small wooden fl\u00fbte-\u00e0-bec, and the tambourin. With his left hand the leader holds the hand of his partner, in his right he waves a flag, handkerchief, or ribbon, which serves as a signal for his followers. As the Faraudole proceeds through the streets of the town the string of dancers is constantly recruited by fresh additions. The leader (to quote the poet Mistral) 'makes it come and go, turn backwards and forwards ... sometimes he forms it into a ring, sometimes winds it in a spiral, then he breaks off from his followers and dances in front, then he joins on again, and makes it pass rapidly under the uplifted arms of the last couple.'\"The Farandoleis usually danced at all the great feasts in the towns of Provence, such as the feast of Corpus Domini, or the 'Coursos do la Tarasquo,' which were founded by King Ren\u00e9 on April 14, 1474, and take place at Tarascon annually on July 29. In the latter the Farandole is preceded by the huge effigy of a legendary monster\u2014the Tarasque\u2014borne by several men and attended by the gaily dressed 'chevaliers de la Tarasque.'"]}, {"page": "English Folk Dance and Song Society", "response": ["1954\u00a0 Violet Alford; Elsie Avril; Marjory Sinclair"]}, {"page": "Hobby horse", "response": ["A custom which took place at, or in the lead-up to, Christmas in eastern Kent, involving a group of ploughmen or other farmworkers leading a Hooden Horse (a horse's head made of wood, set on a short pole, with snapping jaws (sometimes set with nails for teeth) operated by a person hidden under a piece of sacking or a stable-blanket to represent the animal's body). The custom, described as \"only just extinct\" by folklorist Violet Alford in 1952, has since been revived in various places.Hole, Christina (1978).

Britten's score is based on the sea shanty \"A Roving\". The folklorist Violet Alford devised the plot of the ballet. Paul Kildea describes the plot as a \"quayside morality tale\". The plot of the ballet concerns a sailor led astray by a 'bad girl' who was a \"mistress of her trade\" as described in \"A Roving\"; she robs the sailor after the two embark on a pub crawl. The plot was later echoed in Britten's opera Albert Herring. Plymouth Town was never performed in Britten's lifetime. He sent the score without success to the Camargo Society, a prominent promoter of British ballet. Britten's biographer David Matthews notes the influence of Gustav Mahler on the orchestration of the ballet, a note on the score instructs the horns and clarinets to play \"bells up\"; an indication that would have only been seen by Britten on the scores of Mahler's symphonies."]}]}}
