The white power skinhead movement is generally associated with neo-Nazism, in part, this is due to its origins in the National Front and the British Movement, along with the presence of former Nazis (especially former members of the SS) who mentored members of nascent German racist skinhead groups in the 1980s\u20131990s. Historian John F. Pollard contends that \"the racist skinhead ideology is fundamentally neo-Nazi in inspiration.\" Camus and Lebourg also argue that although not all racist skinheads can be classified as 'neo-Nazi', neo-Nazism remains hegemonic in the far-right skinhead movement. Scholars concede at the same time the difficulty of separating the public use of the provocative and subversive aesthetics surrounding Nazi symbols from actual belief in, and commitment to, Nazi ideology.", "White power skinheads perceive both the permissive society and the sexual revolution as \"perversions\", and they generally promote an image of \"clean-living, drug-free, heterosexual, working-class males\". Homophobia and the rejection of any form of drug-taking (except tobacco and alcohol) are common traits found across skinhead groups. According to historian John F. Pollard, this \"puritanical\" stance takes its roots in the anti-permissive way of life of the original skinheads who rejected the mod and hippie subcultures."]}, {"page": "Domenico Tardini", "response": ["*John F.

War and Revolution in Yugoslavia 1941\u20131945: Occupation and Collaboration. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2001. P. 131. Mussolini identified Dalmatia as having strong Italian cultural roots for centuries via the Roman Empire and the Republic of Venice.Larry Wolff. Venice And the Slavs: The Discovery of Dalmatia in the Age of Enlightenment. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, P. 355. The Fascists especially focused their claims based on the Venetian cultural heritage of Dalmatia, claiming that Venetian rule had been beneficial for all Dalmatians and had been accepted by the Dalmatian population. The Fascists were outraged after World War I, when the agreement between Italy and the Entente Allies in the Treaty of London of 1915 to have Dalmatia join Italy was revoked in 1919. The Fascist regime supported annexation of Yugoslavia's region of Slovenia into Italy that already held a portion of the Slovene population, whereby Slovenia would become an Italian province,Allan R. Millett, Williamson Murray. Military Effectiveness, Volume 2. New edition. New York City, USA: Cambridge University Press, 2010.

Pollard. The Vatican and Italian Fascism, 1929-32: A Study in Conflict. Cambridge University Press, 1985, 2005. P.92. The Fascist regime abolished the teaching of minority German and Slavic languages in schools, German and Slavic language newspapers were shut down and geographical and family names in areas of German or Slavic languages were to be Italianized. This resulted in significant violence against South Slavs deemed to be resisting Italianization. The Fascist regime supported annexation of Albania, claimed that Albanians were ethnically linked to Italians through links with the prehistoric Italiotes, Illyrian and Roman populations and that the major influence exerted by the Roman and Venetian empires over Albania justified Italy's right to possess it. The Fascist regime also justified the annexation of Albania on the basis that\u2014because several hundred thousand people of Albanian descent had been absorbed into society in southern Italy already\u2014the incorporation of Albania was a reasonable measure that would unite people of Albanian descent into one state.Owen Pearson. Albania in the twentieth century: a history, Volume 3. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: I.B. Taurus Publishers, 2004. Pp. 389. The Fascist regime endorsed Albanian irredentism, directed against the predominantly Albanian-populated Kosovo and Epirus, particularly in Chameria inhabited by a substantial number of Albanians.Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer. 'Albania at war, 1939\u20131945. West Lafayette, Indiana, USA: Purdue University Press, 1999. P. 70-73. After Italy annexed Albania in 1939, the Fascist regime endorsed assimilating Albanians into Italians and colonizing Albania with Italian settlers from the Italian Peninsula to gradually transform it into an Italian land. The Fascist regime claimed the Ionian Islands as Italian territory on the basis that the islands had belonged to the Venetian Republic from the mid-14th until the late 18th century.Rodogno 2006, p. 84", "The relationship between Italian Fascism and the Catholic Church was mixed, as originally the Fascists were highly anti-clerical and hostile to Catholicism, though from the mid to late 1920s anti-clericalism lost ground in the movement as Mussolini in power sought to seek accord with the Church as the Church held major influence in Italian society with most Italians being Catholic.John F. Pollard. The Vatican and Italian Fascism, 1929\u201332: A Study in Conflict. Cambridge University Press, 1985, 2005. p10. In 1929, the Italian government signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See, a concordat between Italy and the Catholic Church that allowed for the creation of a small enclave known as Vatican City as a sovereign state representing the papacy. This ended years of perceived alienation between the Church and the Italian government after Italy annexed the Papal States in 1870. Italian Fascism justified its adoption of antisemitic laws in 1938 by claiming that Italy was fulfilling the Christian religious mandate of the Catholic Church that had been initiated by Pope Innocent III in the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, whereby the Pope issued strict regulation of the life of Jews in Christian lands. Jews were prohibited from holding any public office that would give them power over Christians and Jews were required to wear distinctive clothing to distinguish them from Christians.Wiley Feinstein. The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-Semites. Rosemont Publish & Printing Corp., 2003. Pp. 56.", "In the 19th century, the forces of Risorgimento (1815\u20131871) had conquered Rome and taken control of it away from the Papacy, which saw itself henceforth as a prisoner in the Vatican. In February 1929, as Italian Head of Government, Mussolini concluded the unresolved Church\u2013State conflict of the Roman Question (La Questione romana) with the Lateran Treaty between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See, establishing the Vatican City microstate in Rome. Upon ratification of the Lateran Treaty, the papacy recognized the state of Italy in exchange for diplomatic recognition of the Vatican City,http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/331566/Lateran-Treaty territorial compensations, introduction of religious education into all state funded schools in ItalyChambers Dictionary of World History (2000), pp. 464\u201365. and 50 million pounds sterling that were shifted from Italian bank shares into a Swiss company Profima SA. British wartime records from the National Archives in Kew also confirmed Profima SA as the Vatican's company which was accused during WW II of engaging in \"activities contrary to Allied interests\". Cambridge historian John F. Pollard wrote in his book that this financial settlement ensured the \"papacy [...] would never be poor again\".John F.
