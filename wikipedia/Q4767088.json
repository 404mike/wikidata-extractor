Jessie M King had purchased her property \u2018Greengate\u2019 and its close in 1909, probably with the encouragement of E A Hornel. By this time Kirkcudbright\u2019s reputation as an artistic centre had been reinforced by the arrival of artists such as William Robson (1863-1950) from Capri via Edinburgh in 1904; Charles Oppenheimer (1875-1961) from Manchester in 1908; William Hanna Clarke (1882-1924) in 1914 from Glasgow; to be followed by David Sassoon (1888-1978) in the early 1920s. The Taylors had taught in Paris before the First World War and had become friends with the Scottish Colourist, S J Peploe (1871-1935), who regularly visited them in Kirkcudbright from 1918. The Taylors\u2019 reputation as teachers was such that Robert Burns, Head of Painting at Edinburgh College of Art, actively encouraged his students to study with them. This introduced a younger generation of Edinburgh artists to Kirkcudbright, including Anne Redpath (1895-1965), Dorothy Nesbitt (1893-1974), Dorothy Johnstone (1892-1980), E A Walton\u2019s daughter Cecile Walton (1891-1956), A R Sturrock (1885-1953) and William Miles Johnston (1893-1974). At the same time Glasgow-based artists and craft workers visited and stayed with the Taylors in Greengate Close or elsewhere in the town, including Helen S Johnstone (1888-1931) originally from Troon, and the metalworker Agnes Harvey (1874-1947) and jeweller Mary Thew (1876-1953). The artist Anna Hotchkis (1885-1984) was a long-term resident of the close, but she also travelled and worked extensively in China in the 1930s.", "The impetus of Kirkcudbright\u2019s artistic community declined gradually through the second half of the 20th century, and some have dated the end of the artists\u2019 community to 1984 when Anna Hotchkis died (she was seen as the last of the 1940s artists). However, the establishment of a WASPS facility, providing 14 studio spaces in the town in 2010, may be seen to mark the beginning of a new phase in Kirkcudbright\u2019s artistic story."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish women artists", "response": ["*Anna Hotchkis (1885\u20131984), painter, writer"]}]}}
