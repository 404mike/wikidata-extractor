Although Charles was doing really well on the build up towards the Olympics it wasn\u2019t enough to be selected. Britain had only one slot, which went to Payne. Charles who was still a teenager at the time was so devastated, that at some point in 2013 she lost the motivation to only keep swimming for the next Olympic opportunity in 2016."]}]}}
