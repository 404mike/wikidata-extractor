Hoskyns mused, \"As bizarrely not-there as Brian seemed through all of this, he seemed to be enjoying himself as much as he is able to. Occasionally he flapped his arms about, and he made a big point of introducing 'Marcella' as a real 'rock'n'roll' song \u2013 as though that were what we secretly craved.\""]}, {"page": "Sandy Denny", "response": ["* Jim Irvin.
