He is quoted as saying: \"Seven years after I bought the shawl, we had nailed Aaron Kosminski.\" However, other experts strongly disagree. Donald Rumbelow criticized Edwards' claims, saying that no shawl is listed among Eddowes's personal effects by the police, and that the policeman who allegedly retrieved the garment was based in North London in 1888, thus making him unlikely to have been present at any of the crime scenes."]}, {"page": "Aaron Kosminski", "response": ["Anderson claimed that the Ripper had been identified by the \"only person who had ever had a good view of the murderer\", but that no prosecution was possible because both the witness and the culprit were Jews and Jews were not willing to offer testimony against fellow Jews. Swanson's notes state that \"Kosminski\" was identified at \"the Seaside Home\", which was the Police Convalescent Home in Brighton. Some authors express scepticism that this identification ever happened, while others use it as evidence for their theories. For example, Donald Rumbelow thought the story unlikely,Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 249\u2013253; Rumbelow, p. 182 but fellow Ripper authors Martin Fido and Paul Begg thought there was another witness, perhaps Israel Schwartz,Begg, p. 276 Joseph Lawende, or a policeman.Fido, pp. 77, 152, 207 In his memorandum, however, Macnaghten stated that \"no-one ever saw the Whitechapel murderer\", which directly contradicts Anderson's and Swanson's recollection.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 255 Sir Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City of London Police at the time of the murders, scathingly dismissed Anderson's claim that Jews would not testify against one another in his own memoirs written later in the same year, calling it a \"reckless accusation\" against Jews.Wilson and Odell, p. 78 Edmund Reid, the initial inspector in charge of the investigation, also challenged Anderson's opinion.Interview with Reid in the Morning Advertiser, 23 April 1910, quoted in Cook, p. 178 There is no record of Aaron Kosminski in any surviving official police documents except Macnaghten's memo.Evans and Skinner, pp. 262, 604", "Former City of London Police officer and crime historian Donald Rumbelow criticised the claim that the evidence proved Kosminski was Jack the Ripper, saying that no shawl is listed among Eddowes's effects by the police. Mitochondrial DNA expert Peter Gill said the shawl \"is of dubious origin and has been handled by several people who could have shared that mitochondrial DNA profile\". The shawl or other material could have been contaminated before or while DNA was being tested; two of Eddowes's descendants are known to have been in the same room as the shawl for three days in 2007, and in the words of one critic, \"The shawl has been openly handled by loads of people and been touched, breathed on, spat upon\". Despite the criticisms, Louhelainen continued to defend his work."]}, {"page": "Jack the Ripper", "response": ["Some researchers have posited that some of the murders were undoubtedly the work of a single killer, but an unknown larger number of killers acting independently were responsible for the other crimes.e.g. Cook, pp. 156\u2013159, 199 Authors Stewart P. Evans and Donald Rumbelow argue that the canonical five is a \"Ripper myth\" and that three cases (Nichols, Chapman, and Eddowes) can be definitely linked to the same perpetrator, but that less certainty exists as to whether Stride and Kelly were also murdered by the same individual.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 260 Conversely, others suppose that the six murders between Tabram and Kelly were the work of a single killer.

According to Napper the display of Deeming's death mask as that of \"Jack the Ripper\" in the Scotland Yard Museum of Crime shows that the police had, in fact, always considered him a prime suspect. The reason that the police officially dismissed Deeming as a suspect of the Whitechapel murders, according to Napper, is that they had believed he was either in jail at the time according to someThe Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper by Martin Fido, London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson. , page 182; The Complete Jack the Ripper: Fully Revised and Updated by Donald Rumbelow, Penguin Books. , page 268 or that he was in South Africa according to others.Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell by Stewart P.
