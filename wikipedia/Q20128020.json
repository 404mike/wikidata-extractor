It was initially drawn by Dave Jenner, but Keith Reynolds drew it for much of its run.  Robert Nixon is also known to have drawn a number of episodes. Tom and Dick repeatedly tried to offload their responsibilities onto their younger sister Sally, and enjoy an easy life at her expense. They nearly always failed and ended up worse-off than when they started. However, sometimes Sally lets them have the last laugh."]}, {"page": "Tim Traveller", "response": ["The first strip featured Tim looking for a bicycle in the town dump, and finding an unusual one. Pulling a dial at the front he was transported to caveman times, at which point he realised the bike could travel through time. He and Crazy for Daisy were the joint winners of the poll, beating Camp Cosmos, Have a Go Jo, Sydd and Trash Can Ally. It was drawn by Vic Neill until his death in 2000. However, Neill strips continued to run for some time in the comic as they had been stockpiled. Once these had run out, Keith Reynolds drew it up to 2004 when the strip was dropped. Only 5 strips appeared in the character's final twelve months in the comic.
