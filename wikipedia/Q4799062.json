Purchased personally by Oxford boat club president Arthur Heywood-Lonsdale from Newcastle boat builder Matthew Taylor, the Oxford crew rowed a practice time of 19 minutes 50 seconds in it, considered \"remarkable\" in a boat with fixed seats.  Lonsdale engaged Taylor to instruct Oxford how to \"send his boat along as quickly as possible\", avoiding connotations of professional coaching which was banned in the Boat Race.  Cambridge rowed in a boat built by Salter of Wandsworth.  It was also the first race in which both crews rowed with round loom oars.MacMichael, p. 233"]}]}}
