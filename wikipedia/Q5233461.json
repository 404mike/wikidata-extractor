He worked in the coal industry as a teenager, but music was always his primary interest. He won a music scholarship and became a pupil of Joseph Parry, which led to his qualifying at University of Wales, Cardiff, in 1895. He went on to become organist and choirmaster of Jewin Calvinistic Methodist Church in London. He succeeded Joseph Parry, his former teacher, in the Music department at Cardiff, where he was appointed a professor in 1908. Among his students there were Morfydd Owen, Grace Williams and David Wynne.Most of his compositions were of a religious nature, including many hymns. Evans edited the revised edition of the Church of Scotland's Church Hymnary in 1927. Notably, it is in this publication that he combined an old Irish folk song with a versified English translation of an 8th-century Irish poem to produce the now widely known Christian hymn, \"Be Thou My Vision\". One of his original hymn tunes, Lucerna Laudoniae, was used to set the words For The Beauty of the Earth. It was initially written under the pseudonym Edward Arthur.Aside from hymns, Evans wrote anthems and service music as well as many orchestral and choral works. The oratorio Llawenhewch yn yr I\u00f4r was first performed at the Caernarfon Festival in 1906 and a dramatic cantata The Coming of Arthur, was premiered at the Cardiff Triennial Festival the following year. His orchestral Concerto for String Orchestra op 7, was published as part of the Carnegie Collection of British Music in 1928. Some compositions attributed to him were in fact written by his eldest son, Arthur, who died in the influenza pandemic of 1918. \nEvans participated actively in the Eisteddfod movement. He died at Rhosllannerchrugog.  His papers are held by the National Library of Wales and some by his grandson, also named David Evans.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1948 in music", "response": ["**David Evans, composer, 74"]}, {"page": "1874 in music", "response": ["*February 6 \u2013 David Evans, composer (d. 1948)"]}, {"page": "David Evans", "response": ["* David Evans (microbiologist) (1909\u20131984), British microbiologist", "* David Evans (mathematician) (born 1940), professor of applied mathematics at University of Bristol", "* David Evans (Yale professor) (born 1970), professor of geology and geophysics at Yale University", "* David Evans (musicologist) (born 1944), ethnomusicologist at the University of Memphis", "* David Evans (geneticist), Australian geneticist", "* David Evans (composer) (1874\u20131948), Welsh composer", "* David Evans (writer) (1893\u20131966), British screenwriter and novelist", "* David Evans (director), director of British film Fever Pitch and various TV shows", "* David Evans (sculptor) (1893\u20131959), English sculptor", "* David Evans (comedian) (1922-1980), English comedian", "* David Evans (MP for Cardiff) (died 1568), MP for Cardiff", "* David Evans (Western Australian politician) (1924\u20132019), Australian politician in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly", "* David Evans (Victorian politician) (born 1934), Australian politician in the Victorian Legislative Council", "* David Evans (British politician) (1935\u20132008), British businessman and Conservative politician, MP 1987\u20131997", "* David Evans (West Virginia politician) (born 1945), member of the West Virginia House of Delegates", "* David Evans, Jr. (1848\u2013?), Wisconsin politician", "* David Evans (political official), British political official and General Secretary of the Labour Party", "* David Evans (Canon at St Asaph) (1705\u20131788), Welsh clergyman and writer", "* David Evans (Archdeacon of St Asaph) (died 1910), Welsh priest", "* David Evans (bishop) (born 1938), Peruvian bishop", "* David Evans (athlete) (born 1967), Australian Paralympian", "* David Evans (footballer) (born 1967), former soccer player/footballer with Chester City", "* David Evans (squash player) (born 1974), Welsh professional squash player", "* David Evans (darts player), Darts player", "* David Evans, one of the three falsely accused students in 2006 Duke University lacrosse case", "* David Evans (cricketer, born 1869) (1869\u20131907), 22 first-class matches between 1889 and 1902", "* David Evans (Hertfordshire cricketer) (1935\u20132008), List A cricketer with Hertfordshire", "* David Evans (Somerset cricketer, born 1928) (1928\u20131991), eight first-class matches in 1953", "* David Evans (umpire) (1933\u20131990), cricketer with Glamorgan and Test match umpire", "* David Evans (rugby) (1886\u20131940), New Zealand rugby union and rugby league footballer of the 1900s and 1910s", "* David Evans (rugby union) (born 1988), Welsh rugby union and rugby sevens player", "* Sir David Evans (archivist) (1893\u20131987), Welsh archivist, Keeper of the Public Records", "* Sir David Evans (RAF officer) (1924\u20132020), Air Chief Marshal/Senior Commander in the Royal Air Force (RAF)", "* David Evans (RAAF officer) (1925\u20132020), Senior officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)", "* David Evans, Baron Evans of Watford (born 1942), British trade unionist and businessman", "* David Evans (administrator) (born 1960), American relief organisation officer", "* David Evans (mathematician and engineer), worked for the Australian Greenhouse Office", "* David Evans (department store), a department store group based in South Wales"]}, {"page": "Be Thou My Vision", "response": ["The hymn is sung to the melody noted as \u201cSlane\u201d in hymnals, an Irish folk tune in  time, first published as \"With My Love on the Road\" in Patrick Joyce's Old Irish Folk Music and Songs in 1909.Patrick Joyce, Old Irish Folk Music and Songs, 1909, p. 151 The tune is a more elemental distillation of earlier forms, such as \"The Hielan's o' Scotland' and \"By the Banks of the Bann,\" also compiled in Joyce (1909).

From there he proceeded to the University of Bristol, where he spent a year in teacher training.
