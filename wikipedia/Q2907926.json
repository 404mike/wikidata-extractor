Born in Scotswood, Newcastle upon Tyne Barclay is best remembered for his time at Sheffield United for whom he played in the 1936 FA Cup Final, but also had spells for Derby County and Huddersfield Town. Barclay also represented England on three occasions, scoring two goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eric Brook", "response": ["In the 1936 British Home Championship, Brook, Ralph Birkett and Tilson each scored in a 3\u20131 victory over Ireland at Windsor Park. In the game against Scotland, Brook was part of an England forward line which included Sammy Crooks, Bobby Barclay, George Camsell and Cliff Bastin. The result was a 1\u20131 draw, which meant that Scotland won the championship that season. In the same year, Brook scored in the 6\u20132 demolition of Hungary. Brook replaced Stoke City's Joe Johnson in the team when he withdrew from the squad due to an injury. One Scottish journalist stated that the 'Hungarians played the prettiest football' and that the score-line was a 'crying injustice'. Another journalist stated that England's wingers, Sammy Crooks and Brook, contributed powerfully to the victory, that Brook constantly did the right thing and that his goal was a gem. A different journalist stated that 'on the extreme left Brook was the opportunist that he always is, and, like Drake, ever a potential matchwinner'. A journalist for the Nottingham Journal stated that Brook and Carter were the best forwards in the second half and that 'they had some splendid passing bouts'. Ted Drake scored a hat-trick in the game and Cliff Britton and Raich Carter scored England's other goals. Drake's second goal was scored from a corner taken by Brook."]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 in English football", "response": ["* 13 July 1969, Bobby Barclay, 62"]}, {"page": "Tommy Johnson (footballer, born 1901)", "response": ["In the 1932 British Home Championship Johnson was part of the team that defeated Scotland 3\u20130 with goals from Tom Waring, Bobby Barclay and Sammy Crooks.
