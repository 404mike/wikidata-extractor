He was sold on to Manchester City in October 1951 for a fee of \u00a325,000, where he became the main focus of the \"Revie Plan\" which saw him named as FWA Footballer of the Year in 1954\u201355 after innovating the role of the first deep-lying centre forward in England. He won the FA Cup in 1956, having finished on the losing side in the 1955 final. He was bought by Sunderland for \u00a322,000 in October 1956, before moving on to Leeds United in November 1958 for a \u00a314,000 fee. In total he scored 108 goals in 501 league and cup appearances in an 18-year professional career, also scoring four goals in six England appearances as well as winning representative honours for the Football League XI and the England B team.\nIn March 1961, Revie was appointed player-manager of Leeds United, then a Second Division club who had never won a major trophy. Under Revie's management, Leeds became a major force in English football, winning the Second Division in 1963\u201364, the First Division in 1968\u201369 and 1973\u201374, the FA Cup in 1972, the League Cup in 1968, the FA Charity Shield in 1969, and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1968 and 1971. Additionally, Leeds were First Division runners-up five times, three times FA Cup runners-up and runners-up in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. In July 1974 he accepted the job as England manager, but had an unsuccessful three years in the role before quitting in highly controversial circumstances to take up the management role with the United Arab Emirates. He later had spells in Middle Eastern club football with Al-Nasr and Al-Ahly.\nAs Leeds manager he was criticised for the physical and often negative approach of his teams, though the period was noted for its highly physical football across the country. His resignation as England manager fuelled criticism of him as money-obsessed, and unproved allegations of bribery and financial misconduct also tarnished his reputation. He retired in 1984, but was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in May 1987, which led to his death two years later. He remains a highly popular figure in Leeds, and has a stand named after him at Elland Road as well as a statue outside the ground.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "England national football team", "response": ["===Don Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson===", "Following Ramsey's dismissal, Joe Mercer took immediate temporary charge of England for a seven-match spell until Don Revie was appointed as new permanent manager in 1974.

Revie resigned in 1977 and was replaced by Ron Greenwood, under whom performances improved. The team qualified for UEFA Euro 1980 without losing any of their games, but exited in the group stage of the final tournament.

Harry Johnston led out a team consisting of Bert Trautmann, Tim Ward, George Hardwick, Jimmy Hill, Neil Franklin, Don Revie, Stan Mortensen, Nat Lofthouse, Jimmy Hagan, Tom Finney and Frank Bowyer (reserve).

His third match of the year was a 2\u20130 win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park in the 1954\u201355 British Home Championship, though on the pitch he did not gel well with Don Revie. Matthews then put in a superb performance in a 2\u20130 win over the Welsh, before he helped England to record a 3\u20131 victory over World Champions West Germany, though only three of the Germans used at Wembley had been in the first XI in the World Cup Final."]}, {"page": "Brian Clough", "response": ["An eight-month spell in charge of Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion, followed, before Clough (without Taylor) returned north in the summer of 1974 to become manager of Leeds United. This was widely regarded as a surprise appointment, given his previous outspoken criticism of the Leeds players and their manager Don Revie. He was sacked after just 44 days in the job but, within months, he had joined Second Division Nottingham Forest where he was re-united with Taylor in the summer of 1976.", "That season, Derby failed to retain their title, finishing seventh, but reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in April 1973, when they were knocked out by Juventus 3\u20131 on aggregate. After the game, Clough emerged from the dressing room and told the expectant Italian reporters \"No cheating bastards do I talk to. I will not talk to any cheating bastards\" and then questioned the Italian nation's courage in the Second World War. It was these sorts of frequent, outspoken comments \u2013 particularly against football's establishment, such as the FA and club directors, and figures in the game such as Sir Matt Busby, Alan Hardaker, Alf Ramsey, Don Revie and Len Shipman, along with players such as Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Peter Lorimer \u2013 combined with Clough's increased media profile, that eventually led to his falling out with the Rams' chairman, Sam Longson, and the Derby County board of directors.", "On 5 August 1973, Clough put his name to an article in the Sunday Express headlined \"I Would Put Leeds in Division Two - Brian Clough lashes Soccer's bosses for letting off Don Revie's 'bad boys,'\" which savaged Leeds United's disciplinary record, stating that Revie should be fined for encouraging his players in their unsporting behaviour and Leeds relegated to the Second Division. Clough also said that \"The men who run football have missed the most marvellous chance of cleaning up the game in one swoop\" and went on to say \"The trouble with football's disciplinary system is that those who sat in judgement being officials of other clubs might well have a vested interest.\"", "Clough left Brighton less than a year after his appointment, in July 1974, to become manager of Leeds United, following Don Revie's departure to become manager of England, though this time Taylor did not join him. Clough's move was very surprising given his previous outspoken criticism of both Revie, for whom Clough made no secret of his deep disdain, and the successful Leeds team's playing style, which Clough had publicly branded \"dirty\" and \"cheating\". Furthermore, he had called for Leeds to be demoted to the Second Division as a punishment for their poor disciplinary record.", "The story of Clough's turbulent 44 day spell in charge of Leeds United was the subject of a novel by David Peace titled The Damned Utd, published in 2006, which focuses on the rivalry between Clough and Don Revie. Despite critical acclaim, the novel was also the subject of controversy for its perceived negative portrayal of Clough as an obsessive, and for some historical inaccuracies. The publishers of the novel were successfully sued by Irish midfielder and former Leeds player Johnny Giles. He wrote: \"Many of the things Peace talks about in the book never happened and, for that reason, I felt it necessary to go to the courts to establish that this was fiction based on fact and nothing more\".

In the first round of the tournament, he scored in the group games against Czechoslovakia and Kuwait. England were eliminated after two goalless draws against both the host nation and West Germany.

He became frustrated and difficult to manage, feeling in limbo playing for a club seemingly going nowhere whilst his younger brother was enjoying great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared to let him go in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly failed to meet the \u00a330,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially willing to pay the fee he eventually decided to instead try an untested youngster at centre-half.
