With Alex Wilkie he proved the decidability of real exponential fields (solving a problem of Alfred Tarski) modulo Schanuel's conjecture from transcendental number theory. With Lou van den Dries he initiated and studied the model theory of logarithmic-exponential series and Hardy fields. Together with David Marker and Lou van den Dries, he proved several results on the model theory of the real field equipped with restricted analytic functions, which has had many applications to exponentiation and O-minimality. The work of van den Dries-Macintyre-Marker has found many applications to (and is a very natural setting for problems in) Diophantine geometry on Shimura varieties (Anand Pillay, Sergei Starchenko, Jonathan Pila) and representation theory (Wilfried Schmid and Kari Vilonen). Macintyre has proved results on Boris Zilber's theory of the complex exponentiation, and Zilber's pseudo-exponential fields."]}, {"page": "Sthithi", "response": ["Sthithi () is a 2003 Malayalam feature film written and directed by R.
