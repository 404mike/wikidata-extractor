The most famous of these include H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre, The Mikado. The popularity of these works was supported for over a century by year-round performances of them, in Britain and abroad, by the repertory company that Gilbert, Sullivan and their producer Richard D'Oyly Carte founded, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. These Savoy operas are still frequently performed in the English-speaking world and beyond.Gilbert's creative output included over 75 plays and libretti, and numerous short stories, poems and lyrics, both comic and serious. After brief careers as a government clerk and a lawyer, Gilbert began to focus, in the 1860s, on writing light verse, including his Bab Ballads, short stories, theatre reviews and illustrations, often for Fun magazine. He also began to write burlesques and his first comic plays, developing a unique absurdist, inverted style that would later be known as his \"topsy-turvy\" style. He also developed a realistic method of stage direction and a reputation as a strict theatre director. In the 1870s, Gilbert wrote 40 plays and libretti, including his German Reed Entertainments, several blank-verse \"fairy comedies\", some serious plays, and his first five collaborations with Sullivan: Thespis, Trial by Jury, The Sorcerer, H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance. In the 1880s, Gilbert focused on the Savoy operas, including Patience, Iolanthe, The Mikado, The Yeomen of the Guard and The Gondoliers.\nIn 1890, after this long and profitable creative partnership, Gilbert quarrelled with Sullivan and Carte concerning expenses at the Savoy Theatre; the dispute is referred to as the \"carpet quarrel\". Gilbert won the ensuing lawsuit, but the argument caused hurt feelings among the partnership. Although Gilbert and Sullivan were persuaded to collaborate on two last operas, they were not as successful as the previous ones. In later years, Gilbert wrote several plays, and a few operas with other collaborators. He retired, with his wife Lucy, and their ward, Nancy McIntosh, to a country estate, Grim's Dyke. He was knighted in 1907. Gilbert died of a heart attack while attempting to rescue a young woman to whom he was giving a swimming lesson in the lake at his home.\nGilbert's plays inspired other dramatists, including Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw, and his comic operas with Sullivan inspired the later development of American musical theatre, especially influencing Broadway librettists and lyricists. According to The Cambridge History of English and American Literature, Gilbert's \"lyrical facility and his mastery of metre raised the poetical quality of comic opera to a position that it had never reached before and has not reached since\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur William \u00e0 Beckett", "response": ["He gave an account of his father and his own reminiscences in  The \u00e0 Becketts of Punch (1903).

I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art\".Stedman, p. 232 Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease.Ainger, p. 107", "In 1875 Carte became the business manager of the Royalty Theatre, under the direction of his client, the popular singing actress Selina Dolaro who was the licensee of the theatre and star of its production of Offenbach's La P\u00e9richole.

The piece, though a financial success, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary run of The Mikado.Jacobs, p. 248 When Ruddigore closed after 288 performances over nine months, Carte mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy for almost a year.Rollins and Witts, p. 11 After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a \"lozenge plot\", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for The Yeomen of the Guard, which premiered in October 1888.Ainger, p. 270 The opera ran for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. This was a happy time for Carte, with a long-running opera, new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction. When Carte asked his partners for a new work, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a \"dramatic work on a larger musical scale\".Jacobs, p. 287 Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: the two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a grand opera that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera.Jacobs, p. 288 The new comic opera was The Gondoliers, which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes, with an initial run of 554 performances.Rollins and Witts, p. 13; and Baily, p. 344"]}, {"page": "List of operettas", "response": ["**With W.

Her son, Strephon, is an Arcadian shepherd who wants to marry Phyllis, a Ward of Chancery. All the members of the House of Peers also want to marry Phyllis. When Phyllis sees Strephon hugging a young woman (not knowing that it is his mother \u2013 immortal fairies all appear young), she assumes the worst and sets off a climactic confrontation between the peers and the fairies. The opera satirises many aspects of British government, law and society. The confrontation between the fairies and the peers is a version of one of Gilbert's favourite themes: a tranquil civilisation of women is disrupted by a male-dominated world through the discovery of mortal love.", "W. S. Gilbert presented his basic idea for a new opera to Arthur Sullivan in October 1881. Gilbert's earliest ideas for the story of Iolanthe originated in his Bab Ballad, \"The Fairy Curate\": \"Once a fairy / Light and airy / Married with a mortal.\"Ainger, p. 215 The fairy marries a \"prosaic\" attorney and bears him a son. After her son grows up, she visits him on Earth, but she is mistaken for his lover, since fairies perpetually appear young and beautiful.Crowther, p. 158 Sullivan found the premise funny, and Gilbert set to work on fleshing out the story.

Upon his return to London in April 1882, he moved into a new home; in May, his beloved mother died rather suddenly.Jacobs, pp. 172\u2013173 By the end of July 1882, Gilbert had supplied Sullivan with lyrics to several of the songs, and Sullivan began work setting them to music. Over the next two months, Sullivan met Gilbert to discuss the libretto as more lyrics were completed. Music rehearsals began in September, and staging began in October, scheduled around performances of Gilbert and Sullivan's previous opera, Patience, which had transferred to the Savoy Theatre a year earlier.Crowther, pp. 167\u2013169 Sullivan was still composing more numbers for the opera until 20 October, with a few modifications continuing into early November. Uncharacteristically, Sullivan composed the overture himself, instead of assigning it to an assistant.Ainger, pp. 211\u2013215 Two casts rehearsed simultaneously, as the opera was to open on the same night in London and New York City, a historic first for any play.Bradley, p. 357", "Gilbert, too, was influenced by earlier works, including The Mountain Sylph by John Barnett. Two characters in Iolanthe, Strephon and Phyllis, are described as Arcadian shepherds. Arcadia was a legendary site of rural perfection, first described by the Ancient Greeks, that was a popular setting for writers of the 19th century. Gilbert had written an earlier work called Happy Arcadia. He had also created several \"fairy comedies\" at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James Planch\u00e9, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321).

S. Gilbert wrote that he wished that the music had been more comic. See Stedman, p. 242 and so forth.

In The Happy Land (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty.Lawrence, pp. 166\u2013167 In Pinafore, Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by \"never go[ing] to sea\".Fischler, Alan.

Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph \"always voted at [his] party's call\", he sacrificed his personal integrity.Lawrence, p. 181 The \"commercial middle class\" (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed.\"Savoy Theatre: The Sullivan Opera Season, H.M.S. Pinafore\", The Times, 10 December 1929, p. 14 In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in The Bohemian Girl. The Times wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that Pinafore was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a \"paternal\" Captain and the \"ethics\u00a0... of all romanticism\" are accepted \"unflinchingly\" and taken to their logical conclusion: \"It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out\".", "There is a divide among Gilbert and Sullivan scholars as to whether Gilbert is, as Jones argues, a supporter of the status quo whose focus is merely to entertain or, on the other hand, predominantly to satirise and protest \"against the follies of his age\".Crowther, Andrew. \"The Land Where Contradictions Meet\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, vol. 2, no. 11, pp. 325\u2013331, Autumn 2000 (discussing the views of various scholars) The Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther posits that this disagreement arises from Gilbert's \"techniques of inversion \u2013 with irony and topsyturvydom\", which lead to \"the surface meaning of his writings\" being \"the opposite of their underlying meaning\". Crowther argues that Gilbert desires to \"celebrate\" society's norms while, at the same time, satirising these conventions. In Pinafore, which established many patterns for the later Savoy operas, Gilbert found a way to express his own conflict that \"also had tremendous appeal to the general public\". He creates \"a highly intelligent parody of nautical melodrama\u00a0... [though] controlled by the conventions it mocks\". While nautical melodrama exalts the common sailor, in Pinafore Gilbert makes the proponent of equality, Sir Joseph, a pompous and misguided member of the ruling class who, hypocritically, cannot apply the idea of equality to himself. The hero, Ralph, is convinced of his equality by Sir Joseph's foolish pronouncements and declares his love for his Captain's daughter, throwing over the accepted \"fabric of social order\". At this point, Crowther suggests, the logic of Gilbert's satiric argument should result in Ralph's arrest. But to satisfy convention, Gilbert creates an obvious absurdity: the captain and Ralph were switched as babies. By an \"accident of birth\", Ralph is suddenly an appropriate husband for Josephine, and both the social order and the desire for a romantic happy ending are satisfied at once.See also Jones, p. 8 Crowther concludes, \"We have an opera which uses all the conventions of melodrama and ridicules them; but in the end it is difficult to see which has won out, the conventions or the ridicule.\" Thus, Pinafore found broadbased success by appealing to the intellectual theatregoer seeking satire, the middle-class theatre-goer looking for a comfortable confirmation of the \"existing social order\" and the working-class audience who saw a satisfying melodramatic victory for the common man.", "H.M.S.
