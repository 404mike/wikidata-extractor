He started his career at Manor Park School in Newcastle upon Tyne, and during his time at Manor Park he also played for the England school team. He then moved to Sunderland as a youth player, where he would progress to become their youngest ever player to make a first team appearance. Forster moved up into the senior side, but suffered limited appearances due to the presence of Jimmy Montgomery.
