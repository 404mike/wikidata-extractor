His wit and epigrams are well-known, one example being \"Even reviewers read a Preface\". He also was the originator of a now-common theory on Henry James, writing that \"The work of Henry James has always seemed divisible by a simple dynastic arrangement into three reigns: James I, James II, and the Old Pretender\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Lloyd George", "response": ["*Slings and Arrows (selected and with an introduction by Philip Guedalla), Cassell and Company, Ltd, 1929"]}, {"page": "Henry James", "response": ["Philip Guedalla jokingly described three phases in the development of James's prose: \"James I, James II, and The Old Pretender,\"Guedalla, Philip (1921).

In his apprentice years, culminating with the masterwork The Portrait of a Lady, his style was simple and direct (by the standards of Victorian magazine writing) and he experimented widely with forms and methods, generally narrating from a conventionally omniscient point of view. Plots generally concern romance, except for the three big novels of social commentary that conclude this period. In the second period, as noted above, he abandoned the serialized novel and from 1890 to about 1897, he wrote short stories and plays. Finally, in his third and last period he returned to the long, serialised novel. Beginning in the second period, but most noticeably in the third, he increasingly abandoned direct statement in favour of frequent double negatives, and complex descriptive imagery. Single paragraphs began to run for page after page, in which an initial noun would be succeeded by pronouns surrounded by clouds of adjectives and prepositional clauses, far from their original referents, and verbs would be deferred and then preceded by a series of adverbs. The overall effect could be a vivid evocation of a scene as perceived by a sensitive observer. It has been debated whether this change of style was engendered by James's shifting from writing to dictating to a typist,Miller, James E. Jr., ed. (1972).
