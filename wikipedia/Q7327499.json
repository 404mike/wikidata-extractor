He was educated at Richmond Hill primary school Sprotborough and Percy Jackson Grammar School Adwick le Street.  He was a tall, right-handed opening batsman of solid technique.  He formed an opening partnership with Geoff Boycott for his native county, and was a stalwart player in an era of scant success for the Yorkshire team.\nHe also played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1975\u20131980) Young England (1973), Rest of England (1976) and T. N. Pearce's XI (1976).  In addition, he appeared for the Yorkshire Second XI (1968\u20131984), Yorkshire Under-25s (1972\u20131974), and the Scarborough Festival XI  (1983) in non first-class games.  In 245 first-class matches he scored 11,723 runs, at an average of 31.17 with 22 hundreds, the largest being 165 not out against Gloucestershire, one of four centuries he recorded against them.  In 137 one day matches he made 2,784 runs at 25.30, with a best score of 101 against Nottinghamshire.\nHe is the brother in law of the South African first-class cricketer, A. J. S. Smith.  His son, Michael Lumb, also played for Yorkshire before moving to Hampshire for the 2007 season, and subsequently to Nottinghamshire in 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Lumb (cricketer)", "response": ["The son of prolific Yorkshire opener Richard Lumb, Lumb was born in South Africa and was educated at Montrose Primary, then St Stithians College in Johannesburg. He was in the South Africa national under-19 cricket team squad for the 1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Lumb made his way through the junior teams in Transvaal before returning to his roots to play for Yorkshire. A hard-hitting batsman, Lumb made his county debut in 2000, scoring 66 not out against the touring Zimbabweans. A knee injury in 2001 meant that Lumb played only a small part in Yorkshire's success in winning the County Championship that year, although he did record a maiden first-class hundred against Leicestershire. In doing so, Lumb became part of only the fourth father-and-son pair to score centuries for Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "List of people from Doncaster", "response": ["*Richard Lumb \u2013 First-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "Steve O'Shaughnessy (cricketer)", "response": [" He took 3\u201323 in a John Player League match against Hampshire in late July, and ended the summer with seven List A wickets, but his only first-class victim of the season was Yorkshire opener Richard Lumb in late August."]}, {"page": "Lumb", "response": ["*Richard Lumb (born 1950), Yorkshire cricketer"]}, {"page": "Alan Wadey", "response": ["Wadey made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Yorkshire at the County Ground, Hove in the 1975 County Championship.
