When she first rose to stardom in Roman Holiday (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than men, in comparison to the curvy and more sexual Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor. With her short hairstyle, thick eyebrows, slim body, and \"gamine\" looks, she presented a look which young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars. In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the \"public embodiment of our new feminine ideal\" in Vogue, and wrote that \"Nobody ever looked like her before World War II ... Yet we recognise the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared.\" The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade. Alongside model Twiggy, Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable."]}, {"page": "Th\u00e9ophraste Renaudot", "response": ["Mark Tungate in 2007 termed him the \"first French journalist\" and the \"inventor of the personal ad\"."]}, {"page": "Tungate, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Tungate"]}]}}
