Going into the final match of the 1987\u201388 season, Torquay United were in third and played Scunthorpe United, only needing a draw to secure automatic promotion.  Torquay United lost the game 2\u20131, and ended the season in fifth position, behind Scunthorpe United.  Torquay United thus faced Scunthorpe United in the other play-off semi-final, with the first leg being played eight days after their final league encounter, again at Plainmoor in Torquay, on 15 May 1988, in front of 4,602 spectators.   Scunthorpe were reduced to ten players when Paul Nicol was sent off.  David Caldwell and Paul Dobson put Torquay United 2\u20130 ahead in the first half, before Kevin Taylor scored in the 71st minute to make the final score 2\u20131 to Torquay United.  The second leg was held three days later at the Old Show Ground in Scunthorpe which was hosting its final game, in front of a crowd of 4,602.  Mark Loram opened the scoring from a Dobson pass for Torquay United despite Scunthorpe dominating the early stages of the match.
