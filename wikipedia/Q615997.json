Since its founding, it has supported radical centrism, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions neoliberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. When the newspaper was founded, the term economism denoted what would today be termed \"economic liberalism\". The activist and journalist George Monbiot has described it as neoliberal while occasionally accepting the propositions of Keynesian economics where deemed more \"reasonable\". The weekly favours a carbon tax to fight global warming. According to one former editor, Bill Emmott, \"the Economists philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative\"."]}, {"page": "International Institute for Strategic Studies", "response": ["* Bill Emmott, journalist"]}, {"page": "Latymer Upper School", "response": ["*Bill Emmott, former editor of The Economist"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British journalists", "response": ["Bill Emmottnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Ishtiaq Ahmed, David Davis, Geoff Hoon, Susan Kramer, Bill Emmott"]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people with PPE degrees", "response": ["* Bill Emmott, journalist"]}, {"page": "Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World", "response": ["Bill Emmott, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said, \"Europeans, Asians, Latin Americans (except Pinochet) and Africans simply don't have a chance in Thatcher's eyes.

It is all the more surprising therefore that having supported British membership of the European Economic Community during the 1970s and having helped to deepen that market during her time as prime minister, she now thinks Britain ought to leave that ghastly grouping, run as it is by bureaucrats and foreigners. To be critical of European countries and of the European institutions is fine: There is plenty to criticise and to change. But in this book Thatcher goes beyond that, arguing in essence that Europe is always to be distrusted because it is full of Europeans and in her lifetime Europeans have always caused trouble.\""]}, {"page": "Emmott", "response": ["*Bill Emmott (born 1956), English journalist"]}, {"page": "Hayek Lecture", "response": ["* 2003 \u2013 Bill Emmott, former editor-in-chief, The Economist"]}, {"page": "Annalisa Piras", "response": ["Annalisa Piras  is a London-based Italian-British film director, impact producer and journalist.
