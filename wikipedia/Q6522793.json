He went on to manage Charlton Athletic, Middlesbrough (during their debut season in the Premier League), Bradford City, Luton Town and Grimsby Town. Lawrence ended his managerial career with a three-year stint as boss of Cardiff City. He is one of a select few managers to have managed over 1,000 games.Since 2005 Lawrence has worked at a number of clubs as either part of the coaching staff or in a Director of Football role. He joined Stevenage in June 2020 as a managerial advisor, to begin at either the restart of the 2019\u201320 season or the start of the 2020\u201321 season, following three years as the management consultant to Newport County, Lawrence left this role in early November 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlton Athletic F.C.", "response": ["Eventually, Charlton were relegated in 1990 along with Sheffield Wednesday and bottom club Millwall.

He went on to enjoy a prolific season, scoring two further hat-tricks in matches against Queens Park Rangers and Tranmere Rovers and also scored six braces, as Cardiff won promotion to the First Division after defeating Queens Park Rangers in the 2003 Football League Second Division play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium.
