From March 1939 she was under reconstruction at the Chatham Dockyard, and was much altered in appearance. Replacement of her machinery was considered, but later abandoned. She was given a new superstructure above the main deck and in many ways resembled a  light cruiser. Her single 4-inch gun mounts were changed to twin mounts,  and several 20mm AA guns and radar were added. In addition, she was fitted with a 3\u00bd-inch cemented armoured belt, 8 feet deep down from the main armoured deck which covered the machinery spaces.
