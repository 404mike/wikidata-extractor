They were both highly athletic, riding, swimming and mountain-climbing, at which Balfour was killed later in life. Evans suffered from near-sightedness, but refused to wear glasses. His close-up vision was better than normal, enabling him to see detail missed by others. Farther away his field of vision was blurry and he compensated by carrying a cane, which he called Prodger, to explore the environment. His wit was very sharp, too sharp for the administration, which stopped a periodical he had started, The Pen-Viper, after the first issue.."]}, {"page": "Arthur Balfour", "response": ["Arthur Balfour was born at Whittingehame House, East Lothian, Scotland, the eldest son of James Maitland Balfour (1820\u20131856) and Lady Blanche Gascoyne-Cecil (1825\u20131872). His father was a Scottish MP, as was his grandfather James; his mother, a member of the Cecil family descended from Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, was the daughter of the 2nd Marquess of Salisbury and a sister of the 3rd Marquess, the future prime minister. His godfather was the Duke of Wellington, after whom he was named. He was the eldest son, third of eight children, and had four brothers and three sisters. Arthur Balfour was educated at Grange Preparatory School at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire (1859\u20131861), and Eton College (1861\u20131866), where he studied with the influential master, William Johnson Cory. He then went up to the University of Cambridge, where he read moral sciences at Trinity College (1866\u20131869), graduating with a second-class honours degree.

May be downloaded from  No doubt largely because of his influence, various authors supported the term, either as such, or as the slightly older \"Urochordata\", but this usage is invalid because \"Tunicata\" has precedence, and grounds for superseding the name never existed. Accordingly, the current (formally correct) trend is to abandon the name Urochorda or Urochordata in favour of the original Tunicata, and the name Tunicata is almost invariably used in modern scientific works.

Two years after graduating from Cambridge in 1880, Caldwell was appointed Demonstrator in Comparative Anatomy, working for Professor Alfred Newton. In 1884, Caldwell used his studentship, which consisted of \"\u00a3200 studentship, a \u00a3500 grant, the prestige and backing of the Royal Society, and letters of introduction from Newton to travel to Australia\" to investigate whether the platypus laid eggs. With the assistance of the local Aborigines, Caldwell set up camp on the banks of the Burnett River in northern Queensland, hunting for lungfish, echidna, and platypus eggs. After extensive searching assisted by a team of 150 Aborigines, he discovered a few eggs. Mindful of the high cost per word, Caldwell famously but tersely wired London, \"Monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic.\" That is, monotremes lay eggs, and the eggs are similar to those of reptiles in that only part of the egg divides as it develops. Caldwell stayed away from the beginning stages of Darwinism and wanted to study evolutionary patterns himself. He believed that patterns of individual development could assist in developing and understanding the process of evolution.Rose, Deborah B. \"Dislocating the Frontier.\" Anu.edu.au. N.p., n.d.
