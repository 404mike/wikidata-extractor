In Brian Epstein's 1964 autobiography, Rowe is quoted as having rejected them with the words: \"Guitar groups are on their way out, Mr. Epstein\", although he denied ever having said this. He later signed the Rolling Stones after their audition, thanks to an introduction and encouragement from George Harrison.", "link_mentions": {}}}
