Dick Rowe, of Decca Records, had heard of the Stones through George Harrison, but when Rowe tried to contact their agent, no-one appeared to know of one. Eventually, Easton's name was mentioned: \"I knew Eric, of course. Once I'd spoken to him, the whole deal went through in a matter of days.\" Easton and Oldham formed an independent record label, Impact Sounds\u2014through which they would manage the group\u2014and signed them on 6 May 1963 for a three-year deal. Philip Norman describes the meeting: Dick Rowe was a friend of Easton's. Rowe\u2014having missed the chance of signing the Beatles the previous year and was still annoyed over it\u2014agreed to sign the band. For their part, Easton and Oldham retained the rights to the group's recorded material, while the group themselves were effectively leased to Decca. Easton intended that he and Oldham would cut out the traditional role of the A&R man, to which end they formed Impact Sounds. This would own and hold all master tapes and recordings, which they would also lease\u2014\"Spector-like\"\u2014when required for distribution. However, the deal almost did not happen: unbeknownst to Easton and Oldham, Jones had already signed a personal recording contract with IBC. Easton gave Jones \u00a3100 with which to buy his way out of his obligations, and in doing so bought the group's master tapes for themselves. The eventual deal with Decca was better news for Easton and Oldham than it was for the band. For example, Easton and Oldman were to be paid 14% of any profits from a single release, but their commitment to the band was for 6%, meaning that Easton and his partner received over half of what was earned.", "To the contemporary music journalist Sean O'Mahoney, Easton was \"vital. Andrew knew nothing about the business side of it... he needed someone who did.\" Easton was conservative, businesslike and practical as well as \"calm, dependable and knew the ropes\". he was generally \"much-maligned\", argues Trynka. Decca executive Dick Rowe called Easton \"respected, a steady pair of hands he could rely on\". Easton was also highly trusted by journalists. Oldham later criticised Easton as lacking artistic vision, while the music executive Harold Pendleton says of the two men's relationship that \"Eric Easton was a run-of-the-mill manager, calm, cold and efficient. Loog Oldham was a temperamental chancer and a fellow who understood artistic people. The combination of the two was better than either of them apart.\" Within the band, Easton was most respected by Wyman, who was a few years older than his colleagues and did not see Easton as distant from the group as they did. Clayson suggests that age was the relevant factor, as the few years Wyman had over the other Stones meant that he had a similar experience of the post-war depression as Easton. Wyman later described Easton as a \"cautious, kindly\" figure, diligent in his work and treatment of his clients. Richards called him a \"very nice guy\". The band generally respected Easton, says Norman, for financing them when they were an unknown quantity, \"and whom, in spite of his desperate naffness, they all rather liked\".
