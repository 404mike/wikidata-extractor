The British Mediterranean Fleet under Edward Boscawen caught them and a two-day battle resulted in three French ships of the line being captured, two destroyed, and five blockaded in neutral C\u00e1diz; two escaped the battle to reach Rochefort. The five French ships in Cadiz were blockaded by Boscawen's second-in-command, Thomas Brodrick. Five of Boscawen's victorious ships were transferred to Admiral Edward Hawke's fleet, off Brest."]}, {"page": "Battle of Lagos", "response": ["The approach of the Gibraltar, firing her guns to indicate that the enemy had been sighted, took the British by surprise. There was a scramble to get under way. Most captains and many crew were ashore; some, including Boscawen, were dining several miles away. Most ships sailed without their captains, some under the command of junior officers. Their seniors followed on as best they couldthe flagship, HMS Namur, sailed with three captains and the admiral on boardand sorted themselves out as circumstances allowed. Many officers and men were left ashore. Several ships were barely seaworthy. The process of fitting, or \"bending\", sails to the masts of the large warships of the time was a complicated one, and most British ships were forced to do this as they got under way, in the dark, undermanned and with few officers. Some were also fitting spars or even stepping in their topmasts. Ships were cluttered with material for their refits and with unstowed stores. HMS Prince had so many casks on one of her gun decks as to be unable to operate that deck's guns; the crew of HMS America threw large amounts of loose material overboard. Despite these difficulties, by 11:00\u00a0pm, within three hours of Gibraltar appearing, eight British ships of the line had warped out of the harbour and were heading for the Atlantic. Several ships were left behind, under Vice-Admiral Thomas Brodrick, with orders to sail as soon as they could be made fit for sea."]}, {"page": "HMS Cumberland (1739)", "response": ["In 1741 she came under Commander Thomas Brodrick, at Jamaica.

After watching it carefully, he despatched full intelligence to Hawke and to the Admiralty, while he himself went to warn Admiral Thomas Brodrick, then blockading Cadiz. His conduct on this occasion called forth an unusually warm encomium from the admiralty, as well as a direct intimation that 'he might very soon expect some mark of their favour' (Minute on Griffith's official letter of 17 November 1759). He was consequently confirmed to the command of the Gibraltar, his commission as captain bearing date 11 December 1759. He continued in her until 1766, being employed in the Mediterraneanin until the peace, and afterwards on the home station. During the Spanish armament in 1770 he commanded the 90-gun  for a few weeks, and in 1776 was appointed to the 64-gun , in which, early in the following year, he joined Lord Howe on the North American station, where he took part in the defence of Sandy Hook against D'Estaing in July and August 1778. He afterwards sailed with Commodore William Hotham for the West Indies, where he shared in the Battle of St. Lucia on 15 December, and in the Battle of Grenada in the following July. When John Byron resigned the command to Rear-Admiral Hyde Parker, Griffith was moved into the 74-gun ; but a few months later, on 18 December 1779, was killed in a slight encounter with the French in Fort Royal Bay, the Battle of Martinique.
