He spent the majority of his career at Wycombe Wanderers.\nBorn in Oxford, Stapleton started his career as an apprentice at Portsmouth, before joining Bristol Rovers in 1988, where he made his Football League debut. He joined Conference side Wycombe Wanderers in 1989, where he helped the team win promotion to the Football League in 1992\u201393. During the same season, Wycombe also reached the final of the FA Trophy, but Stapleton did not play after failing a late fitness test.After making 49 League appearances for the club, he left Wycombe in 1996 and went on to have brief spells with non-League clubs Slough Town and Rushden & Diamonds. He finished his career with Stevenage Borough, where he played against Premier League side Newcastle United in the fourth round of the 1997\u201398 FA Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Wycombe Wanderers F.C.", "response": ["The 1988\u201389 season was surprisingly successful as Kelman built a side that achieved the club's highest ever league finish, fourth in the GM Vauxhall Conference. There was even hopes of the championship in the Spring of 1989 and 4,239 people saw the Wanderers beat Kidderminster Harriers 1\u20130 at Loakes Park, the largest attendance for more than a dozen years. That attendance was eclipsed a couple of months later when 4,890 witnessed Kettering Town steal a 1\u20130 win, the biggest Conference crowd that season. It was a result that put paid to any hopes of winning the league. They were also hopes of another Wembley visit in the FA Trophy, but 1,000 travelling Chairboys saw their dreams come crashing down on the plastic pitch of Hyde United, who created a shock by winning 1\u20130. Kelman had brought in players like Andy Robinson, Martin Blackler, Steve Abbley, Matt Crossley, John Kerr, Andy Kerr and Glyn Creaser, who cost \u00a315,000 from Barnet After the devastating blow of defeat by Hyde, Kelman pulled off a transfer coup, signing the highly rated Barnet striker Nicky Evans for a non-league record fee of \u00a332,000. Evans scored a brace on his debut against Boston United and hopes were high that the club could push on and challenge for the Football League again the following season. Kelman made more astute signings, bringing in Simon Stapleton and Steve Guppy. The team's results and performances were inconsistent. High-flying Barnet were beaten 1\u20130 and a 3\u20130 deficit at home to Kidderminister Harriers was turned around in dramatic fashion when John Kerr's diving header snatched a 3\u20133 draw five minutes from time. On the flip side Cheltenham Town handed out a 4\u20130 thrashing at Loakes Park and the team was hit for four again at Telford United. It was a hugely embarrassing 3\u20131 defeat at Loakes Park in the FA Trophy by the Metropolitan Police that heralded the end of Jim Kelman's reign. The cup exit played its part but the managers relationship with the board had been deteriorating for some time and Kelman handed in his resignation. Kelman's legacy would be there for all to see as his successor would build his historic side out of many of the players brought to the club by Kelman.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887\u20131996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 70. .", "The summer of 1996 was one of change. Out went the likes of Simon Garner, Steve Thompson, Simon Stapleton, Tony Hemmings and Terry Howard. In came two goalkeepers, Brian Parkin and John Cheesewright and centre-back Paul McCarthy, a \u00a3100,000 capture from Brighton & Hove Albion. The season started in bizarre fashion, in more than one sense. The club had to play its opening game of the season away at Shrewsbury Town on a Sunday due to the town's flower show and the team wore a new pin-striped change shirt, which was christened with a stunning equaliser from Steve Brown to earn a 1\u20131 draw. Alan Smith always had a tough act to follow in O'Neill and after falling-out with popular players, playing a role in the changing of the quartered kit to stripes and disappointing performances he had to get results. But he didn't, and after a start of eight league games without a win, the ninth game, a 6\u20133 defeat by Peterborough United was the final straw and he was sacked. Caretaker boss Neil Smillie helped guide the team to two important wins, over Rotherham United and Notts County but a series of defeats followed which left the side languishing at the bottom of the table. It was something of a surprise when John Gregory, a coach at Aston Villa, was appointed the new boss. He slowly started to turn things around, and the team started winning regularly at home. A first round FA Cup tie with rivals Colchester United at Layer Road added some excitement and goals from Miquel Desouza and one from a suspiciously offside looking John Williams gave the Wanderers a very sweet 2\u20131 victory. Gregory realised the need to strengthen the squad and brought in midfielder Michael Simpson from Notts County for \u00a350,000, Michael Forsyth and Jason Kavanagh from Derby County, for \u00a325,000 each, striker Mark Stallard from Bradford City for \u00a3100,000 and striker Paul Read from Arsenal, also for \u00a3100,000. A first away win of the season was gained with an exciting 4\u20133 victory at Bristol Rovers just before Christmas. The team won eight of its last ten home games, remaining unbeaten at Adams Park. However, away wins proved elusive and the battle to avoid relegation went right to the wire. A pivotal result was secured at home to relegation rivals Shrewsbury Town, and it featured two loanees, goalkeeper Martin Taylor from Derby County and returning striker Keith Scott from Norwich City, making his second debut for the club. Taylor made a number of crucial saves and Scott gave the Wanderers the lead and went to win 3\u20130. A second away win came at Notts County, A long-range opportunist strike from Steve Brown was cancelled out, but a winner from Steve McGavin gave the Blues a 2\u20131 win and condemned County to the drop. It was a great escape and Wycombe had won its first battle against relegation in the Football League."]}]}}
