This, however, did not take place, and in the depression of 1841\u20131842 a dozen or so unemployed men and their families were allowed to settle there temporarily. In June 1844, four sections at the western end (874, 875, 878 and 882) totalling about  were sold. In 1848 a cottage, long since demolished, was erected alongside the creek as a residence for the farm manager, and for occasional use by the Governor. In 1858 a residence, complete with swimming pool, was built as a \"summer house\" for the Governor, Sir Richard MacDonnell (served 1855\u20131862), and used by his successors Sir Anthony Musgrave (1873\u20131877), and presumably Sir William Jervois (1877\u20131883), at least until the more imposing edifice at Marble Hill was completed."]}, {"page": "Victoria Peak", "response": ["As early as the 19th century, the Peak attracted prominent European residents because of its panoramic view over the city and its temperate climate compared to the sub-tropical climate in the rest of Hong Kong. The sixth Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Richard MacDonnell had a summer residence built on the Peak circa 1868. Those that built houses named them whimsically, such as The Eyrie, and the Austin Arms."]}, {"page": "High Court of Australia", "response": ["Following Earl Grey's 1846 proposal to federate the colonies, a 1849 report from the Privy Council suggested a national court be created. In 1856, the Governor of South Australia, Richard MacDonnell, suggested to the Government of South Australia that they consider establishing a court to hear appeals from the Supreme Courts in each colony. In 1860 the South Australian Parliament passed legislation encouraging MacDonnell to put the idea to the other colonies. However, only Victoria considered the proposal."]}]}}
