He founded Mind, the first ever journal of psychology and analytical philosophy, and was the leading figure in establishing and applying the scientific method to psychology. Bain was the inaugural Regius Chair in Logic and Professor of Logic at the University of Aberdeen, where he also held Professorships in Moral Philosophy and English Literature and was twice elected Lord Rector of the University of Aberdeen.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Alexander Bain (1810\u20131877), inventor and engineer, first to invent and patent the electric clock and fax machine", "* Alexander Bain (1818\u20131903), philosopher and educationalist"]}, {"page": "John Stuart Mill", "response": ["Mill was a proponent of utilitarianism, an ethical theory developed by his predecessor Jeremy Bentham.

The 19th-century French naturalist George Cuvier, in his eulogy of Priestley, praised his discoveries while at the same time lamenting his refusal to abandon phlogiston theory, calling him \"the father of modern chemistry [who] never acknowledged his daughter\".Qtd. in McLachlan (1987\u201390), 259\u201360. Priestley published more than 150 works on topics ranging from political philosophy to education to theology to natural philosophy.Thorpe, 74; Kramnick, 4. He led and inspired British radicals during the 1790s, paved the way for utilitarianism,Tapper, 322. and helped found Unitarianism.Schofield (2004), 3. A wide variety of philosophers, scientists, and poets became associationists as a result of his redaction of David Hartley's Observations on Man, including Erasmus Darwin, Coleridge, William Wordsworth, John Stuart Mill, Alexander Bain, and Herbert Spencer.Schofield (2004), 52\u201357; Holt, 111\u201312. Immanuel Kant praised Priestley in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781), writing that he \"knew how to combine his paradoxical teaching with the interests of religion\". Indeed, it was Priestley's aim to \"put the most 'advanced' Enlightenment ideas into the service of a rationalized though heterodox Christianity, under the guidance of the basic principles of scientific method\"."]}, {"page": "Pragmatism", "response": ["James credited Peirce again in 1906 lectures published in 1907 as Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking, see Lecture 2, fourth paragraph. James regarded Peirce's \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series (including \"The Fixation of Belief\" (1877), and especially \"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\" (1878)) as the foundation of pragmatism.See James (1897), Will to Believe (which James dedicated to Peirce), see p. 124 and footnote via Google Books Eprint:  See also James's 1907 Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking, Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.In addition to James's lectures and publications on pragmatist ideas (Will to Believe 1897, etc.) wherein he credited Peirce, James also arranged for two paid series of lectures by Peirce, including the 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism. See pp. 261\u2013264, 290\u20132, & 324 in Brent, Joseph (1998), Charles Sanders Peirce: A Life, 2nd edition. Peirce in turn wrote in 1906Peirce, C.S., \"The Founding of Pragmatism\", manuscript written 1906, published in The Hound & Horn: A Harvard Miscellany v. II, n. 3, April\u2013June 1929, pp. 282\u2013285, see 283\u2013284, reprinted 1934 as \"Historical Affinities and Genesis\" in Collected Papers v. 5, paragraphs 11\u201313, see 12. that Nicholas St. John Green had been instrumental by emphasizing the importance of applying Alexander Bain's definition of belief, which was \"that upon which a man is prepared to act\". Peirce wrote that \"from this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism\". John Shook has said, \"Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and fallibilist empiricism as an alternative to rationalistic speculation.\"Shook, John (undated), \"The Metaphysical Club\", the Pragmatism Cybrary. Eprint."]}, {"page": "Stream of consciousness", "response": ["In literary criticism, stream of consciousness is a narrative mode or method that attempts \"to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind\" of a narrator.J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books,1984), pp. 660\u20131). The term was coined by Alexander Bain in 1855 in the first edition of The Senses and the Intellect, when he wrote, \"The concurrence of Sensations in one common stream of consciousness (on the same cerebral highway) enables those of different senses to be associated as readily as the sensations of the same sense\" (p.\u00a0359).William C. Waterhouse, \"The Source of the Stream\". NY Times Review of Books, 22 November 2007. But it is commonly credited to William James who used it in 1890 in his The Principles of Psychology. In 1918, the novelist May Sinclair (1863\u20131946) first applied the term stream of consciousness, in a literary context, when discussing Dorothy Richardson's (1873\u20131957) novels.May Sinclair, 'The Novels of Dorothy Richardson', The Egoist, Vol. 5, No. 4, (April 1908), pp. 57\u201358. Pointed Roofs (1915), the first work in Richardson's series of 13 semi-autobiographical novels titled Pilgrimage, is the first complete stream-of-consciousness novel published in English. However, in 1934, Richardson comments that \"Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf & D.R. ... were all using 'the new method', though very differently, simultaneously\".In a letter to the bookseller and publisher Sylvia Beach Windows of Modernism: Selected Letters of Dorothy Richardson, ed. Gloria G. Fromm Athens, Georgia, University of Georgia Press, 1995, 282. There were, however, many earlier precursors and the technique is still used by contemporary writers."]}]}}
