This was followed up by scoring a brace, as well as, setting up the club's first goal of the game, in a 3\u20131 win against West Ham United. However during a 1\u20130 win against Tottenham Hotspur on 30 November 2008, he suffered a knee injury and was substituted in the 60th minute. Following this, it was announced that Saha would be out for two months. It wasn't until on 22 February 2009 when Saha returned to the first team, coming on as a 74th-minute substitute, in a 0\u20130 draw against Newcastle United. This was followed up by scoring his fourth league goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win against West Bromwich Albion. A week later on 8 March 2009, he came off the bench at half-time in that season's FA Cup quarter-final against Middlesbrough, scoring the winner and helping Everton reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1995. Two months later on 16 May 2009 against West Ham United, Saha scored twice for the second time this season, as the club won 3\u20131. Two weeks later in the FA Cup final, Saha scored the fastest goal in the final's history after 25 seconds, though opponents Chelsea came from behind to win 2\u20131. This broke Bob Chatt's record, set 114 years earlier in the 1895 Final. It was also the fastest goal in any match at the new Wembley Stadium, beating the previous record by Giampaolo Pazzini in March 2007 in an under-21 international for Italy. Throughout the 2008\u201309 season, he established himself in the starting 11, forming a striking partnership with Yakubu.

The final was played for the first time at Crystal Palace, which was to host the finals for the next twenty years. The weather for the final was described as \"a beautiful spring day\", and consequently the crowd and press were still coming into the ground when the game kicked off. From the kick-off, John Devey, the Villa centre-forward, swung the ball out to his inside-left, Dennis Hodgetts. Hodgetts' long cross-pass found Charlie Athersmith on the right, and his centre fell to Bob Chatt who sent the ball goalwards on a half volley. Albion's keeper Joe Reader was only able to get his fingers to the shot, and turned the ball across the goal mouth and, after a goalmouth scramble involving Devey and Albion defender Jack Horton, the ball was turned in to the net. There are no accurate timings for the goal and different reports time it at between 30 and 39\u00a0seconds. At the time, many of the crowd and press missed the goal as they were still taking their seats, and the press reports indicated that Chatt had scored. According to Ward & Griffin in their \"Essential History of Aston Villa\" however, \"after the game, the Villa players confirmed that John Devey had netted after Chatt's shot had been blocked straight into the latter's path and had ricocheted off his knee.\" Despite this claim, The Football Association still credit the goal to Chatt as having been scored on thirty seconds.
