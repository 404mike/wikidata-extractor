He was in the Hyde Seal team when he won the Olympics. Hyde Seal are a Manchester team. He was part of the British water polo team and won two gold medals. The International Olympic Committee credits him with a third gold medal from the 1900 Games, but this is incorrect as he was in England during the tournament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Water polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics", "response": ["German sources do not list Hans Aniol, Max Hainle, or Herbert von Petersdorff as members of the Berliner Swimming Club, mentioning Gustav Erpf, Asmus Simonsen, and Max Sch\u00f6ne instead, but Mallon notes that there is proof contemporary to the tournament for the participation of only the former trio. Three members of the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, Georges Romas, Guillaume S\u00e9ron, and A. R. Upton, are also left off of some lists despite evidence that they participated in the first round. The roster for the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester as listed by the International Olympic Committee is Thomas Coe, John Henry Derbyshire, Peter Kemp, William Lister, Arthur G. Robertson, Eric Robinson, and George Wilkinson. Lister, however, had died two weeks prior to the Games, while Derbyshire, Robinson, and Wilkinson all played water polo matches in England either during the tournament or too soon after it to have traveled back from Paris in time. A list of players contemporary to the match does not include Robertson, but does list Coe and Kemp in addition to Robert Crawshaw, William Henry, John Arthur Jarvis, Victor Lindberg, and Frederick Stapleton. Lindberg has been considered the first New Zealand Olympian, although he \"was born in Fiji to Swedish and Irish parents, lived in New Zealand from a young age and, in Paris, represented a British club.\""]}, {"page": "Water polo at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|George CornetCharles ForsythGeorge NevinsonPaul RadmilovicCharles SmithThomas ThouldGeorge Wilkinson", "* George Wilkinson", "| George Wilkinson ||  ||align=center| 4"]}, {"page": "Gorton", "response": ["* George Wilkinson, three-time Olympic water polo champion, born in Gorton."]}, {"page": "Wilkinson (surname)", "response": ["* George Wilkinson (architect), British architect", "* George Wilkinson (music publisher), English music publisher", "* George Wilkinson (water polo), English water polo player"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left| Men's water polo ||bgcolor=gold| 1st ||align=left| George Cornet, Charles Forsyth, George Nevinson, Paul Radmilovic,  Charles Sydney Smith, Thomas Thould, George Wilkinson || Bye || Bye || Defeated Belgium  9-2"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in water polo (men)", "response": ["|George CornetCharles ForsythGeorge NevinsonPaul RadmilovicCharles SmithThomas ThouldGeorge Wilkinson", "|Isaac BenthamCharles BugbeeGeorge CornetArthur Edwin HillPaul RadmilovicCharles SmithGeorge Wilkinson"]}, {"page": "Water polo at the 1912 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|  Charles Sydney SmithGeorge CornetGeorge WilkinsonCharles BugbeeArthur Edwin HillPaul RadmilovicIsaac Bentham"]}, {"page": "George Wilkinson", "response": ["George Wilkinson may refer to:", "*George Wilkinson (music publisher) (1783\u20131855), English music publisher, and piano and candle manufacturer", "*George Wilkinson (architect) (1814\u20131880), designer of workhouses in the British Isles", "*George Wilkinson (water polo) (1879\u20131946), British Olympics water polo player", "*George Wilkinson (bishop) (1833\u20131907), Bishop of the Scottish Episcopal Church (Diocese of Saint Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane) and Primus", "*Sir George Wilkinson, 1st Baronet, Lord Mayor of London in 1940"]}, {"page": "George Wilkinson (water polo player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Wilkinson (water polo)"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (G)", "response": ["# George Wilkinson (water polo)"]}, {"page": "List of 1908 Summer Olympics medal winners", "response": ["|George CornetCharles ForsythGeorge NevinsonPaul RadmilovicCharles SmithThomas ThouldGeorge Wilkinson"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics", "response": ["Kenny also became the sixth British Olympian to win an Olympic gold in the same event (men's team sprint) at three successive Games, joining three pre-war water polo players Paul Radmilovic (1908-1920, interrupted by the cancelled Games of 1916), George Wilkinson and Charles Sydney Smith (both 1904\u20131912), rower Steve Redgrave (in men's coxless pair from 1988 to 1996)) and sailor Ben Ainslie (in the Finn class between 2004 and 2012).
