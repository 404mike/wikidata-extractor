Buchan's goal was one of \"laying medicine more open to mankind.\" With over 80,000 copies and 19 editions sold in Buchan's lifetime, it was one of the most popular medical texts in Europe and even in the European colonies in the Americas, and was translated into almost every major European language.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* William Buchan (1729\u20131805), physician, writer on medicine for a lay readership"]}, {"page": "1769 in literature", "response": ["*William Buchan \u2013 Domestic Medicine"]}, {"page": "William Smellie (encyclopedist)", "response": ["At the time of his hiring, Smellie edited a weekly called the Scots Journal, which made him familiar with the editing and publication of a work in parts.

Consisting of preventive and curative tools, often related to first aid and medical herbs uses, the concept of domestic medicine, was first made popular in Western countries by Scottish physician William Buchan in the 18th century, and was spread by domestic economy manuals through the following two hundred years. A prime example of this was Buchan's own Domestic Medicine, a manual for at home health care, broken into sections regarding infant health and general diseases.Domestic medicine: or, A treatise on the prevention and cure of diseases, by regimen and simple medicines: with an appendix, containing a dispensatory for the use of private practitioners, Philadelphia, 1784 The purpose of developing this concept was to expand the reach of medicine so every person can understand it and is able to follow it. An example of such a manual was written by English homeopath John Henry Clarke in the 19th century, A Dictionary of Domestic Medicine and Homeopathic Treatment.", "During the late 18th century, after the publication of William Buchan's Domestic Medicine, the concept of domestic medicine explored new ideas that changed the way most people perceived medicine. This was an era in which the majority of health care was provided by individuals who were not considered physicians. These people were often close friends, neighbors, or family relatives of the patient. They were not formally trained by modern medical standards of the time but gained their knowledge of medicine by learning from their predecessors. Therefore, the spread of domestic medicinal practices served as a resource for better health care for those who could not afford a physician or did not have access to more technologically advanced practices of medicine. Yet this does not mean that domestic medicine was born with the publication of Domestic Medicine. Domestic medicine has been in practice from as far back as the early colonial era but Buchan's publication distributed this knowledge out of the hands of the few and to the general public. This was a significant trend as medicine previously had been physician-centered.", "Another proponent of self-diagnosis of medicine was William Buchan, who authored Domestic Medicine, a widespread book empowering individuals to implement their own care. One aspect of the book that led to its prominence was its novel form. Previous medical texts fell into two categories: practical use and philosophical implications of bad health. Buchan's work was able to combine these two genres into a single book meant for common class citizens. William Buchan's book also aided in the consolidation of medical knowledge as it allowed people to rely on written knowledge rather than knowledge passed by word of mouth."]}, {"page": "William Buchan", "response": ["William Buchan may refer to:", "*William Buchan (physician) (1729\u20131805), Scottish physician", "*William Buchan, 3rd Baron Tweedsmuir (1916\u20132008), English peer and author"]}, {"page": "1805 in Scotland", "response": ["* 25 February \u2013 William Buchan, physician (born 1729)"]}, {"page": "1729 in Scotland", "response": ["* William Buchan, physician (died 1805 in London)"]}, {"page": "Hugh James (physician)", "response": ["Hugh James was the son of William James Hugh and Jane Senhouse. \u00a0Born into a Scottish family, well-established in Jamaica, Hugh James became well known as a physician on the island.
