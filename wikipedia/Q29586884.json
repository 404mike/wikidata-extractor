Friendships connected him with the painter John Singer Sargent, the interior designer Sybil Colefax and the composers John Ireland and Percy Grainger, whose choir rehearsals he accompanied on the piano for years. He was also a friend of his student Gervase Elwes, after whose death in 1921 he founded the Gervase Elwes Memorial Fund (later the Musicians Benevolent Fund) to support young musicians.

On a visit to Walpole's cottage in Polperro Melchior \"caused a sensation by singing at a concert in the village\", and later on a visit to Helston he and Walpole both took part in the Floral Dance. In December 1921 on a visit with Walpole to his (Walpole's) parents in Edinburgh, Melchior gave a concert in the Usher Hall. Walpole provided the fledgling Heldentenor with financial aid in February 1922, paying in advance two-thirds of the fees for his studies under Victor Beigel. In 1923, Walpole gave Melchior a further \u00a3800, enabling him to continue his studies with Ernst Grenzebach and the legendary dramatic soprano of the Vienna Court Opera, Anna Bahr von Mildenburg."]}, {"page": "Help Musicians", "response": ["It was created by Victor Beigel in 1921 as the Gervase Elwes Memorial Fund, following the death of English tenor Gervase Elwes.
