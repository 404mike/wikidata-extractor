While playing for Dunfermline, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league in the 1965\u201366 season. Towards the end of his playing career he also worked as a coach, then started his managerial career with East Stirlingshire and St Mirren. Ferguson then enjoyed a highly successful period as manager of Aberdeen, winning three Scottish league championships, four Scottish Cups and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1983. He briefly managed Scotland following the death of Jock Stein, taking the team to the 1986 World Cup.\nFerguson was appointed manager of Manchester United in November 1986. During his 26 years with Manchester United he won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League titles. He was knighted in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours list for his services to the game. Ferguson is the longest-serving manager of Manchester United, having overtaken Sir Matt Busby's record on 19 December 2010.

But another couple of late errors against Arsenal in a 3\u20131 defeat at Highbury the following month put much pressure on Barthez, with two goals gifted to Thierry Henry, one of which came from a mis-hit clearance. Barthez was at the centre of further controversy when, after already being on a yellow card following an argument with Matthew Upson, he was caught by television cameras raising his middle fingers behind his back towards the Arsenal supporters, who had been taunting him for his errors towards the end of the match; the incident was missed by the referee Peter Jones, however. There was much speculation as to what was the source of Barthez's decline, and critics such as the BBC's Phil McNulty urged him to be dropped. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, had faith in his goalkeeper and stuck by him. Consequently, in the second half of the season, Barthez repaired his reputation with consistent, solid performances and the spectacular saves that he was famous for. His turn in fortunes was shown in a 2\u20132 draw with Derby County at Pride Park. Derby forward Malcolm Christie looked to have sealed his hat-trick, but referee Steve Dunn controversially disallowed the goal, ruling that Christie kicked the ball out of Barthez's hands.", "The 2002\u201303 season ended with another Premier League crown for United. The season was a mixed bag for Barthez. One highlight was a fabulous save to deny Dietmar Hamann's 30-yard rocket at Anfield against Liverpool, as United held on to win 2\u20131. In other games, he let goals go past him that he would have been expected to save, and suffered from a run of poor form towards the end of the season. Barthez was also widely criticized in United's exit to Real Madrid in the Champions League, especially for Ronaldo's opener which beat him at the near post.

On 23 May 2013, it was announced that Ferdinand had secured a new one-year contract that would see him stay with the club until the end of the 2013\u201314 season. He was not offered an extension when that contract expired, and agreed to leave Manchester United on 12 May 2014. In a letter on his official website, he said \"I am feeling fit and healthy, ready for a new challenge and looking forward to whatever the future holds for me.\""]}, {"page": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r", "response": ["Solskj\u00e6r joined Manchester United under Alex Ferguson on 29 July 1996, and was something of a surprise acquisition as he was almost unknown outside his homeland and at the time United were still in the hunt for Blackburn Rovers and England striker Alan Shearer, who then joined Newcastle United for a world-record \u00a315\u00a0million. As the only striker to arrive at Old Trafford that year, it was widely expected that his first season would be spent as a backup to Eric Cantona and Andy Cole with only occasional first-team opportunities. However, within weeks of his arrival it was clear that he would be a key part of the first team sooner than had been anticipated, and would also prove himself to be one of the biggest Premier League bargains of the season.", "Back in the Premier League, after eight wins in 10 Premier League games, United travelled to Burnley on 12 January 2021 and won 1\u20130. This put United at the top of the league table after 17 league games, which was the first occasion this happened since the 2012\u201313 title-winning season under Sir Alex Ferguson. The Guardian commented that United exemplified \"unerring determination\" in this game, which was \"a theme of United\u2019s season\" so far. However, United were soon caught by Manchester City, and with a 2\u20131 home loss to bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United on 27 January 2021, failed to regain the top spot. While BBC Sport described United as \"desperately poor\", Solskj\u00e6r suggested that United were unlucky since United had been the \"most consistent team\" that season, and stating that there \"will be no big inquest\" into the loss.", "Manchester United finished runners-up in the Premier League with 74 points, 12 points behind champions Manchester City, and qualified for the Champions League group stage. This was the first time United achieved back-to-back top 4 finish since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement."]}]}}
