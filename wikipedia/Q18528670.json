Johnson", "response": ["After graduating with a 2:2 degree in 1959, he worked as a private tutor and supply teacher in Surrey, while writing increasingly experimental and often acutely personal novels. In his early years he collaborated on several projects with a close friend and fellow writer, Zulfikar Ghose, with whom he produced a joint collection of stories, Statement Against Corpses. Like Johnson's early stories, at least superficially, his first two novels, Travelling People (1963) and Albert Angelo (1964) initially appear relatively conventional in plot terms. However, the first uses several innovative devices and includes a section set out as a film script. The second includes famously cut-through pages to enable the reader to skip forward. His work became progressively even more experimental. The Unfortunates (1969) was published in a box with no binding (readers could assemble the book any way they liked, apart from the chapters marked \"First\" and \"Last\", which indicated preferred terminal points. BBC producer Lorna Pegram employed him to talk about this creation for the TV series Release. With barely any negotiation, the interview was complete months before the book was ready for publication. House Mother Normal (1971) was written in purely chronological order such that various characters' thoughts and experiences would cross each other and intertwine, not just page by page, but sentence by sentence. He won the Eric Gregory Award in 1962 and the Somerset Maugham Award in 1967."]}, {"page": "Carmen Callil", "response": ["From 1967 to 1970 she was publicity manager of the paperback imprint Panther Books. An example of her work was when Callil lobbied BBC producer Lorna Pegram to employ B. S. Johnson to talk about his book The Unfortunates for the TV series \"Release\". Johnson's book had 8 parts that could be read in many different orders. With barely any negotiation the interview was ready months before the book was ready for publication. The film included Johnson holding a mock-up of the book that was not at all similar to the final publication.
