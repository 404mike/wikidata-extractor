As a result of this, everything that is known about Lucian comes exclusively from his own writings. A variety of characters with names very similar to Lucian, including \"Lukinos,\" \"Lukianos,\" \"Lucius,\" and \"The Syrian\" appear throughout Lucian's writings. These have been frequently interpreted by scholars and biographers as \"masks\", \"alter-egos\", or \"mouthpieces\" of the author. Daniel S. Richter criticizes the frequent tendency to interpret such \"Lucian-like figures\" as self-inserts by the author and argues that they are, in fact, merely fictional characters Lucian uses to \"think with\" when satirizing conventional distinctions between Greeks and Syrians. He suggests that they are primarily a literary trope used by Lucian to deflect accusations that he as the Syrian author \"has somehow outraged the purity of Greek idiom or genre\" through his invention of the comic dialogue. British classicist Donald Russell states, \"A good deal of what Lucian says about himself is no more to be trusted than the voyage to the moon that he recounts so persuasively in the first person in True Stories\" and warns that \"it is foolish to treat [the information he gives about himself in his writings] as autobiography.\""]}, {"page": "1920 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 13 October \u2013 Donald Russell, classicist (died 2020)"]}, {"page": "Martin Litchfield West", "response": ["At the age of 4, West entered the private preparatory school of Denmead.
