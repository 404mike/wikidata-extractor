These included Frank Sinatra on the albums Come Fly with Me (1958), Come Dance with Me! (1959) and Come Swing with Me!

", "The Crosby-Clooney collaboration was a sequel to their earlier, more successful album on RCA Victor, Fancy Meeting You Here, also arranged by May, whose other non-Capitol work included another Bing Crosby duet album, this time with Louis Armstrong, entitled Bing & Satchmo; a further duet album twinning Bobby Darin with Johnny Mercer (Two of a Kind); the sixth in Ella Fitzgerald's acclaimed series of Song Books for Verve Records, Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Harold Arlen Songbook; similar dips into Cole Porter and Rodgers and Hart with Anita O'Day (Anita O'Day Swings Cole Porter with Billy May and Anita O'Day and Billy May Swing Rodgers and Hart; both on Verve); Mel Torm\u00e9's Latin-flavoured album (\u00a1Ol\u00e9 Torm\u00e9!: Mel Torm\u00e9 Goes South of the Border with Billy May); Jane Russell's self-titled album on MGM Records in 1958; early albums by Jack Jones (Shall We Dance?) and Petula Clark (In Hollywood); one solitary session with Sarah Vaughan for Roulette Records in 1960, to record the single \"The Green Leaves of Summer\" and three other tracks. May arranged and conducted Once More with Feeling, a 1960 studio album by singer Billy Eckstine on Roulette.", "May's charts often featured brisk tempos and intricate brass parts. One distinctive feature is his frequent use of trumpet mute devices. Another was a saxophone glissando, widely known as his \"slurping saxes\". In slower tempos, he sometimes utilized string sections; good examples of this aspect of his work include his brass chart for \"These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)\" on the Cole album Just One of Those Things; his string arrangement of \"April in Paris\" on Sinatra's Come Fly With Me album; and his arrangement of \"I Can't Get Started\" on Keely Smith's Politely, which includes a nod to May in the lyrics (\"Billy May arranged this for me\").", "May also arranged and produced the song \"River of No Return\" for Tennessee Ernie Ford for the 1954 film of the same name starring Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum. Billy May and His Orchestra is also credited as playing themselves in the film Nightmare (1956), starring Edward G. Robinson, and May as music and vocal arranger of music by Herschel Burke Gilbert, who was the musical director.", "* 1953 Billy May's Bacchanalia", "* 1958 Billy May's Big Fat Brass", "* 1960 Cha Cha!
