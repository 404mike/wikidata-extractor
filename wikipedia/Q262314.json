He is of Italian and Irish descent. He is known for his distinctive, husky singing and slide guitar playing, with the Guinness Rockopedia describing him as a \"gravel-voiced guitar stalwart\". After learning to play the guitar relatively late, a short burst of local band activity led to his launching a solo career in 1978.\nLouder magazine calls Rea \"rock's ultimate survivor\", given his recovery from several bouts of serious illness. He has produced twenty-five solo albums, with several from his later blues period - such as Blue Guitars (2005) - having multiple discs. British Hit Singles & Albums says that Rea was \"one of the most popular UK singer-songwriters of the late 1980s\" and \"already a major European star by the time he finally cracked the UK Top 10 with the release of the [1989] single \"The Road to Hell (Part 2)...\" his 18th chart entry.\" Two of his most successful studio albums, The Road to Hell (1989) and Auberge (1991), topped the UK Albums Chart. His other hit songs include \"I Can Hear Your Heartbeat\", \"Stainsby Girls\", \"Josephine\", \"On the Beach\", \"Let's Dance\", \"Driving Home for Christmas\", \"Working on It\", \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\", \"Auberge\", \"Looking for the Summer\", \"Winter Song\", \"Nothing to Fear\", \"Julia\", and \"If You Were Me\", a duet with Elton John. Rea was nominated three times for the Brit Award for Best British Male Artist: in 1988, 1989 and 1990.Rea has never toured the United States, where he is best known for the 1978 single \"Fool (If You Think It's Over),\" which reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. This success earned him a Grammy nomination as Best New Artist in 1978. A decade later, Working On It topped the Mainstream Rock chart.

Since 1999, there was no contest. TVP chose to invite well-known artists instead, featuring the likes of Whitney Houston or The Corrs. In 2005, TVN was expected to bring the competition back. In 2006 TVN invited Elton John. The Sopot International Song Festival is usually considered bigger than the Benidorm International Song Festival because of its ability to attract star performers. In 2010 and 2011, the festival did not take place due to renovation of the Forest Opera. Since 2012, it is called Sopot Top Of The Top Festival and is broadcast annually by Polsat. The festival also provided opportunity to listen to international stars.
