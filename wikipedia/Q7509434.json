The initiative was led by the proprietor of Ferrybridge Potteries, Sidney Woolf, who became chairman of the company. The site they selected had once been occupied by a monastery dating back to the 7th century.", "The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Sidney Woolf on 29 June 1865. It was designed by Shaw and Weightman in the Italianate style, built by John Stanhope in brick at a cost of \u00a32,400 and was officially opened on 15 September 1865. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Weeland Road; the central bay, which slightly projected forward, featured a wide arched doorway with wrought iron gates flanked by Doric order pilasters on the ground floor, a French door with a wrought iron balcony on the first floor and, above that, a tower which was surmounted by a modillioned cornice and, originally, by a pyramid-shaped roof. The other bays were fenestrated by square headed cross windows on the ground floor and by round headed cross windows on the first floor. Internally, the principal rooms were the assembly hall on the first floor and the suite of rooms that formed the local mechanics' institute on the ground floor."]}]}}
