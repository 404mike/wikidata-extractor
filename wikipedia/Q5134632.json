As a player, he made 169 appearances in the Football League as a Defender for Workington before a near fatal car crash ended his career. Middlemass has gone to see his parents in Sheffield (with his wife and son) to inform them about a possible transfer to Ipswich Town. However, on the way home his car was hit by a lorry near Bradford. After nearly a year out of the game, Clive returned to the side at Workington (then in the 3rd tier), but after a few appearances he realised his injuries had been too severe, and retired from professional playing.\nIn his only role as a manager, he took over at Carlisle United in November 1987, converting a club that had suffered consecutive relegations from the Second to the Fourth Division, to one that narrowly failed to reach the promotion play-offs on goal-difference in 1990. During this season, where Carlisle United had led the division for several weeks, Clive was complimented by the national press on the way he played an attractive style of football with three at the back. A good FA Cup run also saw them drawn against Liverpool, which ended in a 0\u20133 defeat in front of nearly 20,000 at Brunton Park. However, two broken legs to key players, and a run of 4 consecutive away matches to London (in a two weeks) towards the end of the season took their toll. The following season the side failed to kick on, and Clive left the club in March 1991.\nClive started his career away from playing as Assistant to Terry Cooper at Bristol Rovers (1980), and then Bristol City (1982). After leaving Carlisle United (1987-1991), Clive had a brief stint as First Team Coach at Darlington (1991), before becoming Assistant to Jimmy Mullen at Burnley (1992). After Jimmy Mullen left in 1996, Clive briefly took over as Care-taker Manager, before becoming Assistant Manager to Adrian Heath and then Chief Scout under Chris Waddle. In 1998, he joined Preston North End as Chief Scout to David Moyes, and remained for the tenures of Craig Brown and Billy Davies. In 2006, he left as part of Billy Davies' back-room team to take over as Chief Scout at Derby County. In 2010, he hooked up again with David Moyes (a centre-half during Clive's days at Bristol City) as Opposition Scout at Everton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dean Holdsworth", "response": ["Holdsworth primarily played as a striker, although in the latter part of his career he tended to play off the front man. He was a pacey striker with good shooting ability. He started his career at Watford, who finished ninth in the First Division in 1986\u201387 under Graham Taylor's stewardship, before suffering relegation in 1987\u201388 under Dave Bassett and then Steve Harrison. He was loaned out to Carlisle United towards the end of the campaign, and scored once in four Fourth Division games for Clive Middlemass. He joined John Rudge's Port Vale in March, and scored twice at Vale Park in six Third Division appearances. He started 1988\u201389 on loan at Terry Yorath's Swansea City, and returned to Vicarage Road after one goal in five Third Division games. He then joined Steve Perryman's Brentford on loan, before joining the club permanently for \u00a3125,000 in September 1989."]}]}}
