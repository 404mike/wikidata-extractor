One of McQueen's most notable crinoline designs was modelled by the amputee model Aimee Mullins in a series of photographs by Nick Knight for Dazed and Confused, in which Mullin's cage crinoline, deliberately worn without overskirts in order to reveal her prosthetic legs, was described as suggesting both a walking frame and a cage to \"contain the unruliness of the unwhole\".Loschek, p.80Bancroft, pp.48\u201351 The images from this shoot were declared among the most significant commercial images of 1998, representing Knight and McQueen's dedication to presenting alternatives to the traditional concepts of fashion and physical beauty.

On 6 March, The Sunday Times reported on speculation that Middleton had chosen McQueen designer Sarah Burton.

Burton's work came to the notice of Middleton in 2005 when she attended the wedding of Tom Parker Bowles, the son of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Burton had designed the bridal gown for his bride, fashion journalist Sara Buys.

To partially fulfill the 'something blue' portion of the British wedding tradition, a blue ribbon was sewn inside the dress. The design for the bodice of the dress featuring lace in the style of the 19th century was the 'something old'.", "Comparisons were also made to the dress worn by Prince William's mother, Lady Diana Spencer. Vera Wang said \"Diana's dress had a sense of innocence, whimsy, almost storybook romance. In contrast Catherine's gown was about way more than simply the dress.
