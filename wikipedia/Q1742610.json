The Greeks certainly laid the foundation for Western medical practice but much more of Western medicine can be traced to the Middle East, Germanic, and Celtic cultures. The Greek medical foundation comes from a collection of writings known today as the Hippocratic Corpus.Lawrence Conrad, Michael Neve, Vivian Nutton, Roy Porter, Andrew Wear.

Other works of the corpus remained untranslated into English until the resumed publication of the Loeb Classical Library edition beginning in 1988.Vivian Nutton, review of Loeb vols. 5\u20136 (1988).

His studies of the attitudes of the ancients toward diet, exercise, and hygiene and the use of natural methods for the cure of disease culminated in the publication of his De Arte Gymnastica(Venice, 1569). With its explanations concerning the principles of physical therapy, it is considered the first book on sports medicine. The illustrations which accompanied the second edition of the work (1573) proved incredibly fertile to the Western imagination regarding the nature of athletics in the Classical world. Modern scholarship has recognized that these illustrations were largely speculative creations of Mercuriale and his collaborators.Vivian Nutton (2010) \"Girolamo Mercuriale\" in The Classical Tradition ed. Anthony Grafton et al.

Although he was largely hailed as a hero of the city, his posthumous reputation\u2014but not among his contemporaries\u2014would take a sharp turn downwards after his inept handling of the outbreak of plague in Venice in 1575-1577. Mercuriale was summoned by the Venetian government to head a team of medical professionals who would advise about the disease. Arguing against the quarantining and use of lazarettos by the Board of Health, Mercuriale maintained that the disease infecting Venice could not possibly be plague. He and another medical professor, Girolamo Capodivacca, offered to personally treat the sick in Venice on the condition that the quarantines and other precautions put in place by the Board of Health be lifted. The professors and their assistants traveled freely between infected and safe houses, administering treatment, to the horror of the Board of Health and officials in Padua and surrounding cities, who worried the disease would spread. When Mercuriali and Capodivacca began their treatment of the sick in Venice, the death toll had come to a near halt\u2014this was one of the reasons they believed it could not be the true plague. However, by the end of June, the month when they began their work, it rose at an incredible rate. By the beginning of July, the Senate ordered Mercuriale and Capodivacca to be quarantined themselves and it was largely believed that their questionable methods were the reason for the spread of the plague, which eventually claimed 50,000 Venetians, one third of the inhabitants.Richard Palmer, \"Girolamo Mercuriale and the Plague of Venice,\" in Girolamo Mercuriale: Medicina e Cultura nell'Europa del Cinquecento, ed.

Medicine historian Vivian Nutton, in Ancient Medicine, writes that Dioscorides's \"five books in Greek On Materia medica attained canonical status in Late Antiquity.\" Science historian Brian Ogilvie calls Dioscorides \"the greatest ancient herbalist\", and  \"the summa of ancient descriptive botany\", observing that its success was such that few other books in his domain have survived from classical times. Further, his approach matched the Renaissance liking for detailed description, unlike the philosophical search for essential nature (as in Theophrastus's ).

Campbell and Heather Looy (eds.) , A Science and Religion Primer, 118. Vivian Nutton considered the work \"solid and accurate\", but lamented Lindberg's traditional choice of subject matter. He besides thought that his limited inclusion of late mediaeval scientists, particularly in the field of medicine, hurt his argument to stress discontinuity with the renaissance era.Vivian Nutton, \"David C.

William A. Wallace considered The Beginnings of Western Science \"most welcome\", but also stated he had reservations about the omission of several details he considered necessary for an introduction and criticized Lindberg's decision to comment on the continuity thesis while his book doesn't include renaissance science.William A.

F. Jamil Ragep criticizes the book's first edition as Eurocentric. He notes that it claimed that Islamic science declined in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and hardly anything remained by the fifteenth century. The book also didn't emphasize the role of Babylonian science, especially in mathematics.F. Jamil Ragep, \"David C. Lindberg.

Richard C. Dales also thought that Lindberg undervalued Babylonian, but also Egyptian science. He in addition critiques Lindberg's description of twelfth-century science until the translation movement.
