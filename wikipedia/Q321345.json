They wrote that \"\" (\"the expression 'radium emanation' is very awkward\") and suggested the new name niton (Nt) (from , shining) to emphasize the radioluminescence property, and in 1912 it was accepted by the International Commission for Atomic Weights. In 1923, the International Committee for Chemical Elements and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) chose among the names radon (Rn), thoron (Tn), and actinon (An). Later, when isotopes were numbered instead of named, the element took the name of the most stable isotope, radon, while Tn was renamed 220Rn and An was renamed 219Rn, which caused some confusion in the literature regarding the element's discovery as while Dorn had discovered radon the isotope, he had not been the first to discover radon the element."]}, {"page": "Robert Gray", "response": ["*Robert Whytlaw-Gray (1877\u20131958), English chemist"]}, {"page": "List of University of Bonn people", "response": ["* Robert Whytlaw-Gray"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society W, X, Y, Z", "response": ["|Robert Whytlaw-Gray||10/05/1928||14 June 1877 \u2013 21 January 1958"]}, {"page": "List of honorary graduates of the University of Leeds", "response": ["* Emeritus Professor Robert Whytlaw-Gray (DSc)"]}, {"page": "Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights", "response": ["Among other notable scientists who have served on the Commission were Georges Urbain (discoverer of lutetium, though priority was disputed with Carl Auer von Welsbach), Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne (discoverer of actinium, though priority has been disputed with Friedrich Oskar Giesel), Marguerite Perey (discoverer of francium), Georgy Flyorov (namesake of the element flerovium), Robert Whytlaw-Gray (first isolated radon), and Arne \u00d6lander (Secretary and Member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry)."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1928", "response": ["*Robert Whytlaw-Gray"]}, {"page": "Liversidge Award", "response": ["|1935|| Robert Whytlaw-Gray"]}, {"page": "Whytlaw-Gray, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Whytlaw-Gray"]}, {"page": "Discovery of the nonmetals", "response": ["In 1899, Ernest Rutherford and Robert B.
