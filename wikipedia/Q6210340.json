However, the most significant departure was club captain Jimmy Blair who joined A.F.C. Bournemouth for \u00a33,900. His sale resulted in Fred Keenor being appointed the new captain of the first team. He had served as vice-captain under Blair and had filled the role on numerous occasions and was a popular choice for the position. Upon his appointment, the Football Echo remarked that Keenor was \"a leader in every sense of the word, he commands respect of colleagues and sets an inspiring example by his wholehearted enthusiasm.\""]}, {"page": "Dai Davies (cricketer)", "response": ["He made his first-class debut for Glamorgan in Swansea in 1923, when already in his late twenties, scoring 58 and 51 with the bat and taking four wickets against Northamptonshire. Over the course of a 16-year professional career, he scored more than 15,000 runs for the county, including 16 hundreds, in 421 first-class games. Although never close to international honours, he passed 1,000 runs in the season on 7 occasions, with 1,539 in 1930 his best return. Batting with Joe Hills against Sussex in 1928, he helped set a first-class record for Glamorgan for the eight wicket that has stood for over 80 years. A more than useful medium pace and off break bowler who took 275 wickets, he was also an outstanding fielder in the covers in his early years, taking 195 catches in all. Jack Hobbs commended Davies' fielding, describing him as the finest cover point he saw. He was a close contemporary of fellow Welshmen Cyril Walters and Emrys Davies, among the first Welsh cricketers to make an impact playing for Glamorgan."]}, {"page": "Joe Hills (umpire)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Hills"]}, {"page": "Joseph Hills", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Hills"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Joe Hills (1926\u20131931) : J.
