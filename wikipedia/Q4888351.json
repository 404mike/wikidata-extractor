On 26 January 1871, when Stokes was 20 years old he, along with Benjamin Burns, represented Blackheath at a meeting of twenty-one rugby teams at the Pall Mall Restaurant. The outcome of the meeting was the founding of the Rugby Football Union whose Laws were to be drafted by three Old Rugbeians, Algernon Rutter, E.C.Holmes and L.J. Maton. Less than two months later, Stokes, himself an Old Rugbeian, accepted a challenge from Scotland to raise a 20-man side to take to Edinburgh to play in what was to be the first international. Burns was also in the England side and of the 20 men, 10 were former pupils of Rugby School. Stokes was chosen to captain this side, which played Scotland at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871. The laws of rugby were still far from clearly defined at the time and the Scottish and English teams used different interpretations of them, which led to what has been described as \"a sometimes chaotic affair\". Scotland won this first international by one goal and one try to one try."]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|3||Benjamin Burns||forward ||1871-03-27||v Scotland at Edinburgh"]}, {"page": "1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match", "response": ["England: A.
