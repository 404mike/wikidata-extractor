The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled the end for St John, Hunt, Byrne, Yeats and Lawrence; the incomers included Ray Clemence, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd, John Toshack, Brian Hall and Steve Heighway. Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves, they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even, in the case of Heighway, from non-league football.Shankly, pp. 115\u2013117.

Don Revie's Leeds United visited Anfield on Easter Monday for a match involving two of the three 1972\u201373 Football League title challengers. Two minutes after the break Peter Cormack put Liverpool ahead before Keegan added a late second to seal the win. With Arsenal only drawing in their match against Southampton, Liverpool duly closed out the title with a final game 0\u20130 draw against Leicester City to claim their first major trophy since 1966. Toshack also helped the side to win the 1972\u201373 UEFA Cup against German team Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. The 1973 UEFA Cup Final first leg at Anfield was abandoned due to a torrential downpour after 27 minutes and rescheduled to be played again the next day. The 27 minutes that had been played had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's defensive vulnerability in the air. To exploit this, he brought tall forward Toshack into the starting team demoting the small build of Brian Hall to appearing only as a late substitute. Keegan profited with two goals set up by Toshack headers in a 3\u20130 win.

With manager Bill Shankly keen to rebuild his ageing, underachieving team of the 1960s completely, Heighway was signed up swiftly in the May of '70. It was due to Heighway's academic achievements that he got his nickname 'Big Bamber', teammate and fellow university graduate Brian Hall was dubbed 'Little Bamber' both after the television programme University Challenge host Bamber Gascoigne."]}, {"page": "Peter Cormack", "response": ["Cormack won silverware in his second season, when Liverpool emphatically beat Newcastle United 3\u20130 at Wembley in the 1974 FA Cup Final.

Arsenal finished more strongly with a spell of concerted pressure in the latter stages of the half as the game opened up. The first few minutes of the second half consisted of the teams sizing each other up, with no clear chance coming until an opportunity for Arsenal in the 51st minute when Kennedy failed to get his foot to an effort from close range. Play was largely uneventful from then until the 56th minute, when Charlie George again shot wide from long distance. Liverpool's style of play largely consisted of slow, patient attacks, with their first major foray of the half coming in the 58th minute, ending when John Toshack failed to link up with Alun Evans. Eddie Kelly replaced a limping Peter Storey in the 64th minute. Three minutes later, Evans was replaced for tactical reasons for Liverpool by Peter Thompson. He was to have a part in a strong attack by Liverpool less than two minutes later, halted when the ball was cleared by McLintock. The game was briefly paused immediately after this attack, owing to Emlyn Hughes receiving treatment after being hit in the face by the ball. Liverpool were now having more of the possession, though the next clear chance, in the 74th minute, fell to Ray Kennedy when he received a John Radford cross within the goal area. The game opened up considerably from this point, and a George Graham header from a Radford long throw hit the crossbar in the 77th minute. The resulting corner led to a scrambled goal-line clearance by Lindsay. Steve Heighway mounted an instant counter-attack, but it came to nothing. In the next three minutes, Wilson was forced to make two saves in response to further attacks by Heighway and Thompson. A further solo effort by Brian Hall came five minutes before the end of the half, followed shortly afterwards by a shot from Kennedy at the other end.", "By the start of the second period of extra time, the hot conditions and pace of the match were starting to take their toll, with several players (notably Brian Hall and George Graham) suffering from cramp. As such play was more broken, with fewer successful attacks, as crosses frequently failed to find their targets. Liverpool had the first clear chance after five minutes, when a cross from Thompson deep on the right flank narrowly failed to find Toshack. An immediate counterattack required Tommy Smith to tackle Kennedy deep in his own penalty area after Kennedy had received a long ball from Graham. The winning goal was to come moments later in the seventh minute of the period, when a ball from Radford found Charlie George just outside the Liverpool penalty area. His powerful strike beat Clemence to hit the top left of the Liverpool net. He followed this up with his famous celebration, lying on his back with arms outstretched until he was picked up by other members of his team. Liverpool were not to give up, however, and the first opportunity to reply came from Chris Lawler, who defied his cramping legs to attempt a flying kick at a pass from Toshack within the Arsenal area. This was one of the few remaining instances to really threaten in the dying minutes, however, although Radford produced a powerful long-range shot some two minutes before the final whistle.", "|CM ||11||Brian Hall, Liverpoolfc.tv profile\"Brian Hall: Science graduate who became the unobtrusive linchpin in the great Liverpool sides of Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley\" The Independent 18July 2015 Brian Hall"]}, {"page": "1974 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|CM ||8 || Brian Hall"]}, {"page": "Brian Hall", "response": ["Brian Hall may refer to:", "*Brian Hall (actor) (1937\u20131997), English actor", "*Brian Hall (author) (born 1959), American author", "*Brian Hall (Yorkshire cricketer) (1929\u20131989), English cricketer with Yorkshire", "*Brian Hall (Worcestershire cricketer) (born 1934), English cricketer with Worcestershire", "*Brian Hall (Bermudian cricketer) (born 1992), Bermudian cricketer", "*Brian Hall (footballer, born 1946) (1946\u20132015), Scottish footballer who played for Liverpool", "*Brian Hall (footballer, born 1939) (1939\u20132002), English footballer who played for Colchester United", "*Brian Hall (Australian footballer) (born 1952), Australian rules footballer who played for North Melbourne", "*Brian Hall (referee) (born 1961), American football (soccer) referee", "*Brian Hall, one of three mountain climbers lost December 2006, summarized at Mount Hood climbing accidents#Incident history", "*Brian Hall (athlete) (1937\u20132010), English athlete"]}, {"page": "1976 UEFA Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||15 || Brian Hall", "|MF ||15 || Brian Hall"]}, {"page": "1973 UEFA Cup Final", "response": ["The 27 minutes that had been played the previous day had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly insight into how to beat Borussia.
