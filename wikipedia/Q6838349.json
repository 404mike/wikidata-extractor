He spent time with Barking, Grays Athletic, West Ham United (without making a first-team appearance), and Faversham Town, before he joined Oxford United in 1964. He helped the club to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1964\u201365, before he moved on to Port Vale in July 1967. He helped the \"Valiants\" to also win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1969\u201370, before he was moved on to Stafford Rangers in May 1972. After five years with Rangers he ended his career at Leek Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Morris", "response": ["*Mick Morris (footballer, born 1943) (1943\u20132020), English footballer", "*Mick Morris (Australian footballer) (1882\u20131959), Australian rules footballer", "*Mick Morris (Gaelic footballer) (born 1944), former Irish sportsperson"]}, {"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["He did not retain the services of four players for the 1972\u201373 season: Mick Morris, Keith Ball, Stuart Sharratt, and John Flowers. Lee made some key signings however, bringing in Stafford Rangers goal-machine Ray Williams for \u00a33,000, midfielder Freddie Goodwin (Southport), 'controversial' goalkeeper Alan Boswell (Bolton Wanderers), young midfielder Colin Tartt, and trialist goalkeeper Reg Edwards (Nuneaton Borough). Six wins were gained from the opening eight league games, though low attendances caused Lee to remark that \"the people here are not genuinely interested in league football\". Offered the management position at Shrewsbury Town, he rejected the offer as he believed the club \"lacked potential\" and that he had a \"feeling of loyalty towards the [Vale] players\". In mid-season he sold John James to Chester for \u00a35,000, Ray Harford to Colchester United for \u00a31,750, and Keith Lindsey to Gillingham for \u00a3750, whilst spending \u00a32,250 to bring 'pacey' striker John Woodward in from Walsall. Lee's team was criticized for foul play, particularly on 10 March, when Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy branded them \"a brutal and physical side\". In the FA Cup, West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood claimed that the Vale players attempted \"the most blatant calculated intimidation I have ever seen anywhere in the world\". Vale finished in sixth spot with 53 points, four short of promoted Notts County. The 69 goals conceded tally was higher than that of all but the bottom two clubs."]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["Numerous players were let go before the 1967\u201368 campaign began; a young Ray Kennedy's departure would be bitterly regretted over the next two decades. The club also 'reluctantly' accepted a \u00a325,000 Blackpool bid for Terry Alcock. Two new signings were Roy Chapman and Mick Morris, both free transfers. The club took a pre-season tour of Czechoslovakia. In November the FA launched an investigation into alleged breaches of rules on payments to players by the club. By January the investigation became a commission, looking charges of weekly wages for 'amateurs', playing schoolboys, extra bonuses for victories, and an illegal signing on bonus and other bonuses paid to John Ritchie, as well as bonuses to Clint Boulton and Gordon Logan, as well as gifts to young players that broke FA rules. In February the club admitted to the charges and were fined \u00a32,000, later doubled, and told that irrespective of where they finished in the table, they would be made to apply for re-election to the Football League at the end of the season. On 8 June they were readmitted to the league by 39 votes to 9. Stanley Matthews 'gradually drifted out of the picture' and Gordon Lee was appointed as manager. It was later revealed that Matthew's left being owed money by the club, which they never paid him, a key reason as to why he never managed in England again.In 1968\u201369, Lee won respect for his 'honesty and enthusiasm' as the club consolidated their league status. Bill Asprey retired to go into coaching in a quiet season for the club. Football hooliganism started to take its grip on the game, and Vale's early experience of it consisted of witnessing the Chester City team coach smashed with bricks. At the end of the season the club were in debt to the tune of \u00a3178,277, with a \u00a310,900 loss being made on the season. Already strict economies were tightened by the club hierarchy.", "Long serving players Mick Morris and Keith Ball were released, as was John Flowers. Numerous new signings were made for 1972\u201373, most notable Ray Williams. After a 7\u20130 thrashing by Rotherham United \u2013 blamed largely on Alan Boswell, the side went on a run of five wins. Lee continued to bemoan the fans, saying 'the people here are not genuinely interested in league football', though he turned down a job offer at Shrewsbury Town out 'of loyalty to the players'. Vale went out of the FA Cup 1\u20130 to West Ham United in the third round, Ron Greenwood claimed 'we were lucky to come out alive' after Vale gave a physical display, though Lee defended his players 'enthusiasm'. What was indefensible however was the violence of a minority of supporters, leaving two Londoners nursing stab wounds. In January John James went to Chester for \u00a35,000.

Nevertheless, the run put them at the top of the table, and Lee credited his team's hard work and fitness. John James played on despite an injured ankle, Mick Morris found himself a permanent fixture as an energetic utility man, whilst Tommy McLaren also worked his way into the first eleven. The defence conceded just six goals in the opening fifteen league games. The run included a 1\u20130 win over Chesterfield at Saltergate, a 2\u20130 win over nearby Crewe Alexandra in front of a season-best Burslem crowd of 12,538, and a 'war of attrition' in a 1\u20131 draw 'full of ugly incidents' with Wrexham at the Racecourse Ground in front of a crowd of 19,946.
