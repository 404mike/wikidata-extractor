He uses it to summon a daemon army, thereafter called the Cohort of Free Daemons, to oppose the forces of the Chaos God, Sutekh, thus allowing the young Hittite musician, Lisarwa, to repair the Veil that separates the physical world from the dangerous wild energies of the Netherworld, using another of the relics, the Harp of Daud, once owned by his father (King David).

He is Tupilu's uncle, who took him into his own family when he was orphaned, and is portrayed as a thoughtful, sympathetic man. In The Shadow Prince, he is haunted by guilt at his father's apparent usurpation of the throne and comes to believe that only his own self-sacrifice will abate the gods' anger and end the plague known as the White Death; he is dissuaded from this action by Ra'an, who explains the true circumstances of his father, Suppiluliumas, coming to the throne. He is also revealed to be, unwittingly, the biological father of the Amazon princess, Birrula. In the second book, The Isles of Winter: Ra'an's People, he suffers a stroke and is nursed back to health by Kantiya, daughter of the royal physician."]}]}}
