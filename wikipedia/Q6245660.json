He was known as \"Johnny Lyttelton\" to his friends and family.\nHe was educated at Eton, where his father had been before him, and at Christ's College, Christchurch while his father was Governor-General of New Zealand. He later attended the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester.\nHe married Penelope Ann Cooper in 1974, and inherited the family's titles and 200-year-old Worcestershire mansion, Hagley Hall, on his father's death in 1977. Facing inheritance taxes and high maintenance costs  as well as the unstable state of finances left by his predecessors, he auctioned his family's 700-year archive for \u00a3164,000, and sold Necker Island to Richard Branson for $120,000. The hall was converted into a conference venue, although it also remained the family home. \nHe was a member of the Conservative Party, but shyness prevented him from taking the seat in the House of Lords that his hereditary peerage entitled him to. He left the Conservatives in 1992, in protest at Michael Heseltine's announcement that many coal mines would be closed. His first wife was a special adviser to David Mellor when Mellor was Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport in 1992. Lady Cobham was later to leave her husband for Mellor, and they were divorced on 30 August 1995. Lord Cobham had to sell family heirlooms to pay his former wife a \u00a31 million divorce settlement. He later confessed to having contemplated suicide over the break-up of his marriage, and admitted sitting in his drawing room holding a loaded shotgun.Lord Cobham remarried on 1 August 1997 to Lisa Clayton, the first British woman to have sailed single-handed and non-stop around the world.\nHe opposed the introduction of the ban on fox hunting, and said he would rather go to prison than to prevent hunting from taking place on his estate.Lord Cobham died in Spain. His ashes were returned to Hagley for burial in the Lyttelton plot at Hagley parish church. He had no children from either marriage, and his titles were inherited by his younger brother, Christopher.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Necker Island (British Virgin Islands)", "response": ["Richard Branson was made aware that some of the islands in the British Virgin Islands were for sale in 1978. Branson soon after went to the British Virgin Islands for a holiday to investigate the prospective real estate. On first observing the islands, he envisioned using them to put up rock stars for his record label. Upon arrival, they were given a luxury villa and travelled around islands for sale by helicopter. The final island he saw was Necker Island, and after climbing the hill and being stunned by the view and wildlife, decided to purchase the island. After making a lowball bid of $100,000 for the island (due to his relatively modest funds at that time in his career), he was turned down and escorted back to the mainland. A year later, the owner, John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham, in need of short-term capital, eventually settled for $120,000. However, the government imposed a restriction on alien landholders: that the new owner had to develop a resort within four years or the island would revert to the state. Branson committed to building a resort on the island."]}, {"page": "Royal Agricultural University", "response": ["*John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2006", "response": ["*John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham, 63, British aristocrat."]}, {"page": "John Lyttleton, 11th Viscount Cobham", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham"]}, {"page": "John Lyttelton", "response": ["* John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham (1943\u20132006), British nobleman"]}, {"page": "Christopher Lyttelton, 12th Viscount Cobham", "response": ["The second son of the 10th Viscount Cobham, Lyttlelton inherited the title on 13 July 2006 on the death of his elder brother, John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham, who had no children.
