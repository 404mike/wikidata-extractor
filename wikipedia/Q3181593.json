On 29 April 1937, in the Basque country, he was among the first reporters to enter the ruins of Guernica with the Nationalist forces. In the newspaper, he reported only that the town had been 'burned' but on Sunday 2 May he privately reported to the British Ambassador, Sir Henry Chilton, in Hendaye, that Guernica had been destroyed in an air-raid and these were German and Italian air tactics. He asked the ambassador not to use his name otherwise he would not be permitted to report from Franco's Nationalist headquarters, since their line was the Republicans had set fire to and blown up their own town.Herbert R. Southworth, Guernica! Guernica! A study of journalism, diplomacy, propaganda and history, University of California Press, 1977, p.61 & p.212  In China, he reported for the Daily Telegraph on the atrocities of the invading Japanese. According to John Simpson, he was killed on 18 November 1937, the last day of the Chinese army's stand in Shanghai. John Gittings, however, on his website www.johngittings.com, quotes Five Months of War (Shanghai: North-China Daily News & Herald, 1938), p. 133 as putting Stephens' death on 11 November. Gittings' quotation goes on to describe Stephens as having been shot while watching the fighting from a water tower, when a Japanese machine gunner unexpectedly raised his aim. The Japanese apologized, explaining that they had been shooting at snipers on nearby roof-tops.  His chauffeur, Bernhard Arp Sindberg, was with him at the time of his death at the water tower. Bernhard would later save over 6,000 Chinese during the Nanking Massacre. A friend of Stephens', O'Dowd Gallagher from the Daily Mail, wrote the story of Stephens' death and sent it to the Daily Express.John Simpson, 'My History Hero', BBC History Magazine Vol 11, no 6, June 2010, p. 98http://www.johngittings.com/id65.html (On the other hand, the biographer of Edgar Snow says that O.D.

She described her students there in a letter home as \"very serious about their work but [having] a gaiety which saves them from being priggish.\" Her friend, the China specialist John Gittings, later remarked that her contact with these students, many of whom came from working class backgrounds, \"gave Davin an intuitive understanding of the Chinese that would enrich her long academic career\" and that at this time she already showed \"a mature sensitivity for the contradictions of revolutionary China.\"", "Davin was one of the first scholars to study Chinese Communist Party policies on women and the problems of working them out in practice. Her first major work was Woman-Work: Women and the Party in Revolutionary China (1976), which she published after returning from her second stay in Beijing. The scholar Gail Hershatter called the work \"classic\". She explained that the book followed policies from the 1930s until 1949, but spent the most time and detailed analysis on the 1950s. Chapters treated the Women\u2019s Federation, marriage reform, the effects of land reform and collectivization on women, and the lives of urban women. Davin, Hershatter continued, acknowledged the great changes brought about by the new \"Party-state\", and described the contradictions between the reformist Marriage Law and the realities of its results; women in the countryside were also caught between economic independence and their continued fixed place in patrilocal families. The book, said Hershatter, \"effectively laid out an agenda for much of the subsequent scholarship on women in the Mao years\". John Gittings wrote that the book went \"far beyond the stereotypes offered both by the communist regime and its critics\" and that it probed the \"tensions between a new 'socialist' emphasis on women\u2019s participation in economic and political life and a relatively unchallenged structure of gender and generational relationships in the family.\"", "In 2013, Davin published a short biography Mao (Oxford University Press, Very Short Introduction Series; 2013) John Gittings wrote that the book \"rejected current appraisals of Mao as no more than 'a Chinese Stalin with a taste for killing', while recognising that his flawed and contradictory character brought great harm to China...\" The scholar Gregor Benton commented that sometimes \"resisting a jumbo-history doesn't necessarily produce a compelling focus and can lapse at worst into patronizing simplification,\" but that in this case \"a broader picture remains unremittingly central, though not at a cost of nuance and some speculative reflection.\"Gregor Benton, \"Mao: A Very Short Introduction, by Delia Davin,\" The China Journal, no. 72 (July 2014) DOI: 10.1086/677118"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Cannon", "response": ["At Oxford in 1960-1961, Cannon was editor and owner, with Stephan Feuchtwang, of Oxford Opinion (OO).
