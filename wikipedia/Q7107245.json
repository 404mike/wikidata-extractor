Lewry studied mathematical logic under Lejewski and A.N. Prior at Manchester (1961\u20132). From 1962\u20137 he taught the philosophy of language and logic at Hawkesyard.  He was assigned to the Oxford Blackfriars in 1967.  Dissatisfaction with teaching led him to work for an Oxford D.Phil. on the logic teaching of Robert Kilwardby.  In 1979 he began the study of the history of grammar, logic and rhetoric at Oxford in the period 1220\u20131320.  In 1979 he went to the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto first as a research associate, then as a senior fellow. He died on 23 April 1987 at the age of 57 at the Oxford Dominican House.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Index of logic articles", "response": ["Osmund Lewry --"]}, {"page": "Arthur Prior", "response": ["During his time at Oxford, Prior met Peter Geach and William Kneale, influenced John Lemmon, and corresponded with the adolescent Saul Kripke.
