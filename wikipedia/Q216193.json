He is best known for his murals, particularly in Anglican churches.  In all he worked in thirty Anglican churches (28 as a muralist, and two\u2014including Ely Cathedral\u2014as sculptor only) and produced what is probably the largest body of work in his particular m\u00e9tier by any artist in the history of the Church of England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portmeirion", "response": ["The houses Anchor, Arches, the hotel building, Lady's Lodge, the inside of the Pantheon and the vaulted ceiling of Gate House are decorated with murals and frescoes by the Frankfurt-born artist and friend of Clough Williams-Ellis Hans Feibusch."]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Hans Feibusch (1898\u20131998) \u2013 born in Frankfurt, resided in England 1934\u20131998"]}, {"page": "Newport, Wales", "response": ["* Twelve painted murals by Hans Feibusch (1961\u201364) at the Newport Civic Centre."]}, {"page": "George Bell (bishop)", "response": ["During the war, Bell was involved in helping not only displaced persons and refugees who had fled the continent to England, but also interned Germans and British conscientious objectors.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Bell encouraged engagement between the church and the arts.

In 1954, German artist and muralist Hans Feibusch, known to the then-incumbent Bishop of Chichester George Bell since 1940, was commissioned to design a mural for the chancel arch in the church.  His design, representing Christ in Majesty, is well regarded\u2014for example, Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner recorded that the \"swirling, Baroque design\" was \"a good deal better\" than other church decoration of the era\u2014but its unveiling aroused strong feeling at diocesan level.  Some traditionalist members of the diocesan advisory committee, perturbed by the boldness of the design (which included imagery described as \"violently masculine and brutal\"), raised their objections at the diocese's consistory court\u2014a type of ecclesiastical court.  Bishop Bell, who passed the judgement at the court, managed to settle the dispute, and the mural was unveiled in September 1954.

A conventional district was formed in 1900, the tin building was ready in 1901, and it became a parish church in 1922 when a large parish was created.  Local architect Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel was commissioned to design the permanent church once enough money had been raised, and work took place between 1932 and 1934.

In addition, St Elisabeth's crypt contained a series of large wall paintings by the artist Hans Feibusch (1898-1998). Through this work he came to the attention of Charles Herbert Reilly, professor of architecture, and George Bell who provided Feinbusch with the opportunity to create a mural of his own design at St Elisabeth's in 1944.  Feibusch chose the allegory of Pilgrim's Progress as a vehicle for his own story as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany and his eventual acceptance in 1940s Britain.

For over forty years Bray worked with the muralist Hans Feibusch painting in churches across Britain.

The liturgical west door is surmounted by a tympanum, which is decorated with sgraffito, an art form rarely found in Britain, but which matches the external design. Sgraffito is a form of tempera mural painting. The artist was Augustus Lunn, the leading proponent of the style in the mid-20th-century. The subjects of the sgraffito are the Joyful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Inside, the reredos on the liturgical east wall is a painted mural of the Ascension by the German \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist, Hans Feibusch, with whom Ford often collaborated. On the walls on either side of the Feibusch mural are stained glass windows, by Claire Dawson. They depict two archangels: St Michael (the patron saint of St Mary's mother church) and Uriel. Dawson was also the artist responsible for mural paintings under the arcades, designed according to the doctrine of typology, whereby the events of the Old Testament foreshadow those of the New Testament. The statue of Virgin and Child is carved of limewood, and was the work of the sculptor Philip Bentham (1913-85). The Stations of the Cross were a later introduction, in 1992. They are ceramic, and were installed by John Dawson."]}]}}
