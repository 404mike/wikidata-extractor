Her portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn (as also, it is reputed, was that of Dr Hill as Principal). In 1800 his eldest son died in Jamaica and in 1803 his younger son George and a daughter died of plague. Others were ill and in danger. Another son died in the service of the East India Company, while yet another progressed to a position of importance there. His son Alexander Hill followed him into the Ministry. His daughter married a fellow academic, Dr Cook whose brother, George Cook, was his biographer. So he was the brother of Hill's son-in-law, and a beneficiary of his patronage. He paints a portrait of a kindly, humorous but serious man who loved and was loved by his family. In his Ministry he was universally loved, according to Mr Cook, while anonymous letters (actually by Andrew M Thomson) suggesting that he worked the patronage system to his own, and his sons' advantage are dismissed. He did not let religious or party political differences harm good relationships and he certainly \"did not regard religious controversy as a proper subject for general conversation\". He was a member of various societies - for the sons and widows of clergymen, a Bible Society in St Andrews. He was also a founding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and became rector of the university.", "His son, Alexander Hill, was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1845."]}, {"page": "Alexander Hill", "response": ["Alexander Hill may refer to:", "* Alexander Hill (minister) (1785\u20131867), Scottish minister of the Church of Scotland", "* Alexander Hill (academic) (1856\u20131929), British physician and academic", "* Alexander Hill (rower) (born 1993), Australian rower", "* Alexander Hill (Ross Island), a hill on Ross Island, Antarctica", "* Alexander Hills, mountain range, California"]}, {"page": "James Paull (moderator)", "response": ["In 1846 he succeeded the Alexander Hill as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland the highest position in the Scottish Church.
