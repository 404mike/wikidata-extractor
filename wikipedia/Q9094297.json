Her sacking was so controversial that fellow actress Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) threatened to quit, but she was eventually persuaded not to.

It was this storyline, and its limits because of filming outdoor scenes in the studio, that prompted the Street's bosses to create an outdoor set.

It was the third cinema to open in Britain, and by the time of its closure in 2001 it was the third longest-running cinema in the country. Its original single-screen auditorium had been fitted with 675\u00a0seats. Before the advent of \"talkies\", the Scala had a resident female cinema pianist, and the conductor Sir John Barbirolli once played the piano to accompany the silent films. Violet Carson, who went on to play Ena Sharples in Coronation Street, was also a resident pianist. During the 1930s the popularity of the new \"picture houses\" grew rapidly, with 109 in Manchester at its peak. Many people visited The Scala three or four times a week. The craze for cinema-going was seen by some as a social ill of its time; school teachers complained that pupils were not doing their homework because they were spending too much time at the cinema.
