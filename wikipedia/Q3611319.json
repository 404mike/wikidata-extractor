He is one of the founders  of Microformats.\nMarks was listed at #13 in The Daily Telegraph's 50 most influential Britons in Technology.Marks was Vice President of Web Services at BT. He became Principal Engineer for Technorati after working for both Apple and the BBC. At the TechCrunch event Realtime Stream Crunchup he announced that he would be joining BT to work together with JP Rangaswami. He worked at Salesforce.com from 2011 to 2013 as their VP of Open Cloud Standards.\nAt the first BloggerCon, Marks discussed the power curve as it applies to weblogs:\nThe net changes the power law of the media curve. If you look at relative popularity on the web, using something like Technorati, you get a power curve that goes all the way down gradually, to the bottom where you see pages that got just a single click. If you look at popularity in the \"real\" world \u2014 best-selling books, or top music \u2014 the power curve drops like a stone from a very high level. That's because in order to get a book published, or a piece of music recorded, you have to convince somebody that you're going to sell a million copies. You end up in a zero-sum game, where people pour enormous resources into being the number one, because number two is only half as good. The promise of the net is that the power of all those little links can outweigh the power of the top ten.\nIn 2003, Marks was an early experimenter with and contributor to the technologies that became popular under the names podcasting and iPodder in 2004.\nAt the 4 October 2003 BloggerCon, Marks demonstrated a program that downloaded RSS-enclosure audio files and transferred them to Apple's iTunes music player, which could then synchronize them onto an iPod. In his weblog post from the conference that day, Marks mentioned discussing the program with Adam Curry, who also blogged about their chat the next day.Kevin previously worked for Google as a Developer Advocate on OpenSocial.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dave Winer", "response": ["Winer's weblogging product, Radio Userland, the program favored by Curry, had a built-in aggregator and thus provided both the \"send\" and \"receive\" components of what was then called audioblogging.Curry, Adam, October 21, 2002 UserNum 1014: Cool to hear my own audio-blog...
