He was then selected for the 1990 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France at the end of the 1990 NSWRL season. Unfortunately, an ankle injury suffered in Australia's 19\u201314 loss to Great Britain in the first test loss at Wembley, London limited him to just six games on the English leg of the tour and he lost his test spot to Broncos teammate Dale Shearer. The first test loss was something of a disaster for Hancock as his opposite winger Paul Eastwood crossed for two of the Lions three tries on the day. Although he returned to action, before the second Ashes series test, scoring a try in a 36\u201318 win over Halifax, Shearer's form was such (scoring a try in the Aussies 14\u201310 win at Old Trafford in the second test) that Hancock was unable to regain his test spot for the remainder of the tour."]}]}}
