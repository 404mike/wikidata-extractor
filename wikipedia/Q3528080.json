He caught rheumatic fever on the tour of Australia the following winter, and missed the whole of the 1937 season.The evidence was strong in 1938 that Fagg was back to his best form. He set a first-class world record playing for Kent against Essex at Colchester, scoring 244 in the first innings and an undefeated 202 in the second innings in a drawn match, becoming the first batsman in first-class cricket history to score double centuries in both innings of a match.  This feat was not equalled until 2019, when it was achieved in Sri Lankan domestic cricket by Angelo Perera. The 1938 season was a year of record-breaking, and the young Leonard Hutton cemented his place as England's first choice opener with his 364 against the Australians at The Oval.\nFagg played only one more Test, though he remained a consistent scorer in county cricket until the mid-1950s. In all, he scored 58 centuries and more than 25,000 runs.\nAfter retirement, he became a cricket umpire, officiating in eighteen Test matches and seven One Day Internationals. In an incident at Edgbaston in 1973, he refused to take the field after the West Indies team disputed one of his decisions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kent County Cricket Club", "response": ["Kent scored 803 for 4 declared against Essex at Brentwood in 1934, with Bill Ashdown scoring 332, Ames 202 not out and Woolley 172.

Lancashire scored 271 on the Saturday (Statham, batting eleven, was last man out without scoring) and they reduced Kent to 62 for four at the close with Statham having taken the wicket of Arthur Fagg, caught by Alan Wharton for four. Statham later recalled that it was fluke dismissal. His captain Cyril Washbrook told him to maintain a good length against Fagg who was strong against short-pitched bowling and played the hook shot exceptionally well. Statham started well enough, conceding only a couple of singles in his first two overs but he then mistimed a delivery which pitched short and Fagg went to hook it. Fagg was, however, surprised by Statham's pace and he mishit his shot, the ball going off the splice of the bat and being caught by Wharton at forward short leg. Statham said Washbrook liked his speed but not his length.Derlien, pages 22 and 23."]}, {"page": "Hugh Bartlett", "response": ["With 1548 runs at 57.33, Bartlett finished fifth in the averages (behind Wally Hammond, Joe Hardstaff, Jr., Len Hutton and Eddie Paynter).

Immediately after his innings against Australia, when Arthur Fagg dropped out, Bartlett was added to the English team to tour South Africa that winter. He toured and scored 358 runs at an average of 51.14 in the first-class matches but did not play in any of the Tests.

Then, in the third test at Lords, play was interrupted by an IRA bomb scare (later found out to be a hoax). While the crowd cleared out of the ground in record time, Bird and the players sat down in the centre of the pitch, knowing there was no bomb there. He gained a reputation for stopping play for weather, and almost never giving batsmen out LBW \u2013 he gave LBWs so seldom that if he did give it, there was absolutely no doubt the batsman was out. Bird was also very strict on the definitions of \"intimidatory bowling\", both from short-pitched deliveries and high full tosses, and made it abundantly clear he would tolerate none of it."]}, {"page": "Harold Gimblett", "response": ["Gimblett's status as one of the coming men of English cricket was confirmed by his selection on the Players' side for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, one of the centrepieces of the English cricket season. He was not a success, making just three and one. But he retained his place in the England team for the second Test at Old Trafford, opening this time with the Kent batsman Arthur Fagg, who was making his Test debut. This time, Gimblett failed, making just nine in England's single innings. The carrot at the end of the 1936 season was selection for the MCC team to tour Australia and New Zealand in the 1936\u201337 season; the side was picked in early August, and Gimblett was not named in it, the young opening batsmen selected being Fagg and Charles Barnett, who replaced Gimblett for the third and final Test match against India. In fact, Gimblett's form for the second half of the 1936 season was patchy, and from the high of averaging 200 with the bat in May he ended up at the end of the season with an aggregate of 1608 runs at an average of 32.81, half a dozen runs per innings less than both Fagg and Barnett. Wisden noted that he had achieved \"nothing of note\" in important matches apart from his \"dashing\" 67 in his first Test. It went on: \"As his slip-fielding fell rather below international standard, it became abundantly clear that he could not yet be labelled an England player.\" And it repeated criticism of a year before about lack of discretion: \"Using the horizontal bat with a great amount of freedom, he frequently fell, through lack of discrimination in selecting the right ball to hit, to catches on the leg-side. Still, most of his faults were due to inexperience, and as he is only 22 years of age his career will be watched with interest beyond the confines of his own county.\""]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Arthur Fagg||||18||1967||1975"]}, {"page": "Wisden Trophy", "response": ["This three Test series saw the West Indies re-establish themselves as the superior team.

The drawn match at Edgbaston was at risk of being abandoned when umpire Arthur Fagg threatened to withdraw after Kanhai disputed one of his decisions. The final Test match at Lord's was dominated by the West Indies, with the team posting a huge total of 652/8 before declaring, Kanhai, Sobers and Bernard Julien all getting centuries.
