A \"calm, popular left-hander who also bowled leg spin\", Ikin played most of his cricket for Lancashire. He was a solid left-handed batsman whose statistically modest Test record underplayed his contribution to the team as a sturdy foil to such players as Bill Edrich, Len Hutton and Denis Compton.", "link_mentions": {}}}
