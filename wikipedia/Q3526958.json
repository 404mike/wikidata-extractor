A \"calm, popular left-hander who also bowled leg spin\", Ikin played most of his cricket for Lancashire. He was a solid left-handed batsman whose statistically modest Test record underplayed his contribution to the team as a sturdy foil to such players as Bill Edrich, Len Hutton and Denis Compton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ashes", "response": ["Aged 38 and having been unwell during the war, Bradman had been reluctant to play. He batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to Jack Ikin; England believed it was a catch, but Bradman stood his ground, believing it to be a bump ball. The umpire ruled in the Australian captain's favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear, scoring 187. Australia promptly seized the initiative, won the First Test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post-war era. The controversy over the Ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era."]}, {"page": "Don Bradman", "response": ["Controversy emerged on the first day of the First Test at Brisbane. After compiling an uneasy 28 runs, Bradman hit a ball to the gully fieldsman, Jack Ikin. \"An appeal for a catch was denied in the umpire's contentious ruling that it was a bump ball\". At the end of the over, England captain Wally Hammond spoke with Bradman and criticised him for not \"walking\"; \"from then on the series was a cricketing war just when most people desired peace\", Whitington wrote.Whitington (1974), p 190. Bradman regained his finest pre-war form in making 187, followed by 234 during the Second Test at Sydney (Sid Barnes also scored 234 during the innings, many in a still standing record 405 run 5th Wicket partnership with Bradman. Barnes later recalled that he purposely got out on 234 because \"it wouldn't be right for someone to make more runs than Bradman\"). Australia won both matches by an innings. Jack Fingleton speculated that had the decision at Brisbane gone against him, Bradman would have retired, such were his fitness problems.Fingleton (1949), p 22. In the remainder of the series, Bradman made three half-centuries in six innings, but was unable to make another century; nevertheless, his team won handsomely, 3\u20130. He was the leading batsman on either side, with an average of 97.14. Nearly 850,000 spectators watched the Tests, which helped lift public spirits after the war.Bradman (1950), p 139."]}, {"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["As a batsman, Hammond started the tour well, scoring 208 in an early game, but lost form once the Tests began. One of the turning points of the series was a disputed catch in the first Test. Bradman, who looked in poor form and uncertain to continue his cricket career for much longer, had reached 28 when the English team believed he had edged the ball to Jack Ikin at slip. Bradman, as was his entitlement, waited for the umpire's decision instead of leaving the field. The fielders were certain that he was out, but the umpire said he was not, believing the ball had bounced before it was caught; opinion among other participants and spectators was divided. However, Hammond was extremely angry, saying loudly, either to Bradman or the umpires, \"a fine fucking way to start a series\".Foot, pp. 217\u201318.Gibson, pp. 173\u201374. Afterwards, relations between Hammond and Bradman deteriorated and there was a coldness between them. Bradman went on to score 187 and Australia won the match and, ultimately, the series. In that first Test, Hammond played two good innings on a very difficult wicket,Howat, p. 114. but in the series, he did not pass fifty, scoring 168 runs at an average of 21.00 before missing the final Test. In all first-class cricket, he scored 633 runs (average 45.21). He suffered increasing pain from fibrositis throughout the series, and later admitted that he felt close to a breakdown.Foot, p. 218.Howat, p. 122. Hammond played his last Test in New Zealand at the end of the tour, scoring 79 in his final innings. He ended his career with 7,249 Test runs at an average of 58.46. His 22 centuries remained an English record until surpassed by Alastair Cook in December 2012."]}, {"page": "Keith Miller", "response": ["Miller made his Ashes debut in the first Test in Brisbane. Bradman opted for six front-line bowlers, with Miller as high as number five in the batting order.Perry, p. 186. Australia batted first, with Miller coming in at 3/322.Pollard (1988), p. 381. He played aggressively to reach his fifty in just 80 minutes, striking a six onto the roof of the members' stand at long on, the biggest hit at the ground at the time, before being trapped leg before wicket by Doug Wright for 79 as Australia made 645.Perry, p. 188.Whitington, p. 112. Miller was given the new ball along with Lindwall and he took his first Ashes wicket, bowling Hutton as England closed at 1/21. The following day, the pitch had turned into a sticky wicket following a heavy tropical storm. Miller bowled off breaks at medium pace and mixed in a large amount of bouncers.Perry, p. 189.  On the unpredictable surface, Edrich was struck around 40 times on the body. Miller cut through the English top order, removing Edrich, Washbrook, Compton and Jack Ikin on the fourth morning, finishing with 7/60 as England made 141 and were forced to follow on. Miller took two wickets, including the dismissal of Hutton with first ball of the second innings as England fell to defeat by an innings and 334 runs and Miller had match figures of 9/77.Perry, p. 191.Whitington, pp. 112\u2013113.", "The Australians moved onto the next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored a half-century and took 3/31 in an innings victory.

Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower.Growden, pp. 174\u2013175. In 1946\u201347, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and it was thought that he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the disputed catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing.Growden, pp. 176\u2013177. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier.Growden, p. 178. As Fingleton was one of the few who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory.Growden, pp. 177, 179.

In the warm-up matches ahead of the Tests, he hit 57, 57 and 28 against the touring MCC team. He then scored 114 and 36 not out against South Australia in his last match before the beginning of the Ashes series. After a long deliberation, and against medical advice, the 38-year-old Bradman decided to resume as Test captain.Bradman, pp. 126\u2013128. As Brown was injured and O'Reilly had retired, Hassett was appointed vice-captain.Perry (2000), pp. 178\u2013186. The First Test at Brisbane revealed a more circumspect Hassett. He made 128 (from 395 balls in 392 minutes), his maiden Test century, and shared a 276-run partnership with Bradman, the cornerstone of Australia's match-winning score of 645. Although the crowd continually barracked Hassett for his slow scoring, Ray Robinson felt that he played a crucial \"anchoring\" role in support of Bradman, who initially struggled with his timing, controversially survived an appeal for a catch by Jack Ikin, then limped through the latter stages of his innings with a strained muscle.Harte and Whimpress, p. 396. Hassett later joked that one of his brothers had his wedding on the day, and was waiting for the batting to finish before starting the ceremony, but could wait no more and proceeded, only to come back after the marriage had been completed to find that just one run had been scored in the intervening period and that his brother was still only on 97.Haigh, p. 6."]}, {"page": "Ken Higgs", "response": ["In his junior days concentrating on football with Port Vale, Higgs did not take seriously to cricket until his late teens.

At the start of each Test, Wright would receive telegrams and letters from well-wishers who had lamented his bad luck \"Never a match went by in which he did not hopelessly defeat the defences of the leading run-getters.

In the early matches of the tour, his defensive rather than his wicket-taking talents were to the fore: by the start of June, he had taken only 14 first-class wickets, but more than a third of his overs were maidens and he was averaging less than 1.8 runs per over from his bowling. In the first Test, following two large first innings, the South Africans struggled in their second innings against Alec Bedser and set England just 186 to win on a pitch that was affected by rain. Athol Rowan and Mann bowled England out for 114 and Mann's four for 24 came in 24 overs, of which 16 were maidens. The Times commented on Mann's accuracy which was, it wrote, as if \"bowling on a sixpenny-piece over after over\"; when he took his first wicket, that of Jack Ikin, his figures were one for six runs off 15 overs. The next two Tests were not successful either for Mann personally or for his team, with both games lost, and the fourth match of the series was played on a batting pitch at Leeds and Mann bowled 60 overs, taking three for 97, as England matched South Africa by scoring more than 500 before rain washed out the final day. The fifth and final Test at The Oval was played on a pitch that suited spin bowlers, but Mann was not fit to play: his absence, Wisden wrote, \"was keenly felt, for the pitch should have proved ideal for his left-arm slow bowling\". He returned to the team for one final county match against Middlesex at Lord's, but the game was washed out and he did not take a wicket in just six overs of bowling.

The balding and bespectacled Paul Gibb had a sensational tour of South Africa before in 1938\u201339, when he hit 473 runs (59.12) and two centuries, but in Australia was found to have a weakness against leg-spin and failed. He was chosen for the First Test ahead of Godfrey Evans because of his batting ability, but Evans proved to be a decent batsman, a perky, attacking player who tried to take a run off every ball, but in the Fourth Test he went for a record 95 minutes before scoring while Compton made a century at the other end.p174, R.L Arrowsmith, EVANS, Thomas Godfrey, E.W. Swanton (ed), Barclays World of Cricket, Collins Willow, 1986 At 28 Jack Ikin was one of the younger English players on the tour and apart from five first class matches in 1938 and 1939 he was a post-war player. Not noted for his footwork or strokeplay he was a gritty left-hander who was picked even though he only made one century for Lancashire in 1946. He was popular in Australia as he was a Tobruk Rat who had fought alongside the Australian 9th Division in North Africa.p105, Cary Norman Yardley was a sensible player who liked to play his strokes on the leg-side and though he never made a Test century was a good man in a crisis.p252, R.L Arrowsmith, YARDLEY, Norman Walter Dransfield, E.W. Swanton (ed), Barclays World of Cricket, Collins Willow, 1986 James Langridge, Peter Smith and Bill Voce were bowlers who regularly made runs and even centuries for their counties, but Doug Wright's only hundred had become before the war and afterwards was relegated to the bottom of the batting order. Alec Bedser was a tailender who was capable of hitting a few runs on occasion and Dick Pollard's lack of batting ability was cited as one of the reasons why he was not picked for a Test in the series.", "Doug Wright was seen as England's trump card when he arrived in Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before,p68 Swanton and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly.p156, Miller After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball fiercely and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946\u201347 and again in 1950\u201351 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play.pp7-8, Cary Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.pp426-427, K.M.

Wisden noted that Lomax's \"pace and lift\" was met with \"only feeble resistance\". Lomax's batting was often useful too, usually at No 7 or No 8 in the batting order, although when either Jack Ikin or Cyril Washbrook was called up for Tests, he opened the innings, with indifferent results. In the season as a whole he made 694 runs at an average of 17.79, and he passed 50 twice, the higher innings being 78 against Kent at Mote Park, Maidstone, when he shared a sixth-wicket partnership of 193 in two hours with his captain, Nigel Howard, who made an unbeaten 138.

However, Johnson, Lindwall, McCool, Miller, Tallon and Toshack had played in an Australia vs New Zealand match the previous season which was belatedly recognised as a Test, the only game between the two countries treated as such before 1973. As a result, only Morris and Tribe are now seen as debutants with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett having played only four Tests before the war and Sid Barnes one. Don Bradman made himself available for selection at the last moment against the advice of his doctor due to the severe attack of fibrositis during the war, an ailment from which the England captain Wally Hammond also suffered. There were no English debutants; Hammond, Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, Paul Gibb, Bill Voce and Doug Wright were all pre-war players, vice-captain Norman Yardley had played one Test before the war and Alec Bedser and Jack Ikin had debuted against India in 1946. The vaunted England batting line up had done well so far on the tour, with Hutton making 522 runs (87.00), Washbrook 461 runs (51.22), Edrich 221 runs (44.20), Compton 423 runs (60.43) and Hammond 277 runs (55.40), but their bowling had been weakened by injuries. Gibbs was preferred as wicketkeeper over Godfrey Evans because of his batting form in South Africa in 1938\u201339. There had been a drought in Queensland since 1941 and the curator had tried boring for water without success. The Woolloongabba wicket, traditionally green and helpful to fast bowlers, was a dry, lifeless brown and good for runs. Bradman won the toss and had no difficulty in choosing to bat first.pp. 58\u201360, Swanton", "Bradman had only made 28, when he played Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it high in the air in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to me sitting watching from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.pp. 22\u201323, Miller", "The innings began well for England as Wally Hammond caught Arthur Morris in the slips and Alec Bedser had Don Bradman struggling in his third over, the Australian captain twice edging the ball to the close fielders. He was protected by Sid Barnes who controlled the strike and hooked the England bowlers until \"Big Al\" jumped up like a goalkeeper, knocked up the ball and took the catch on the rebound. Barnes (31) was officially reprimanded for using the hook and eliminated this stroke from his repertoire for the rest of the series. At 72/2 Bradman was still struggling on 28 after an hour at the crease when he gave his famous catch to Jack Ikin off Bill Voce. The England players were so sure it was out (along with half the Australian team in the dressing room) that they did not immediately appeal and did so only after Bradman refused to walk. In a controversial umpiring decision Umpire Borwick gave him not out and Bradman later said he thought he had jammed the ball into the ground before it went to Ikin and that he was willing to let the umpire be the judge. Hammond was furious at what he saw as gamesmanship that only spoke to the Australian captain when calling the toss for the rest of the series. After this incident Bradman recovered his confidence and with Bedser off the field due to a stomach ailment (a legacy of his service in Italy) made 159 runs in 160 minutes. His vice-captain Lindsay Hassett dug himself in for 128 and they added 274 for the third wicket. Hassett's brother was getting married that day and agreed to wait until he was out before they began the service. They gave up when he was 97 and he was still on 98 when they finished. Bradman was bowled by Bill Edrich (3/107) early on the second day and Hassett added another 106 runs with his fellow-Victorian Keith Miller who hit 6 fours and a six in his 79. Hassett also hit a six, but was dropped three times before he was caught by Norman Yardley off Bedser (2/159).

Doug Wright was the terror of the County Championship for running through side on just such wickets and Hammond also had Peter Smith and the part-time spin of Ikin, Compton and Hutton. Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris only batted for 9 minutes when the rain came down and the teams left the field. On their return Bill Edrich (3/71) made the ball kick up with his fast bowling, and Morris was bowled while taking evasive action. Ian Johnson  came in as a nightwatchman and he and Barnes angered the crowd by launching into a series of bad light appeals \u2013 up to 12 were counted \u2013 before the umpires gave way and play was ended with an hour to spare.pp. 32\u201333, Cary This gamesmanship ensured that Australia would not have to play on a sticky wicket like England at Brisbane and allowed Bradman to rest his leg until play resumed on the Monday. Clif Cary opined in his radio commentary that the light was bright enough to play by and the umpires had been pressured into a decision by the Australian batsmen, as did the English pressmen. They were labelled \"biased, unsportsmanlike squealers\" and that Barnes and his captain Bradman would never use such underhand tactics, but at the end of the series Barnes admitted on radio that he had bluffed the umpires into the decision. Sunday was a rest day and the sun dried out the wicket beautifully, it rolled to perfection and produced the flat wicket anticipated on the first day. Barnes had been reprimanded for hooking the ball in the First Test and as a result denied himself strokeplay and slowly ground his way through the day. Johnson was out for 7, and Barnes added 59 with Lindsay Hassett (34) and 63 with Keith Miller (40). Alec Bedser (1/153)  bowled well and stopped the runs from getting away, but with defensive fields many catches went begging, but Peter Smith (2/172) failed to find his form (he was hospitalised with appendicitis on the tour). Don Bradman had lowered himself down the order and \"limped as if in extreme pain, and several times lay on the ground as if ill\" Wright (1/169) \"bowled beautifully with the most wretched luck\", in one over \"On four occasions Hammond, usually most undemonstrative, threw his hands in the air as the ball beat Bradman and shaved the stumps, and in between these near dismissals there was a confident appeal for leg before wicket.p. 60, Cary When Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Jack Ikin at short leg, but \"this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way\".p. 31, Cary Bradman was given not out and by the end of the day Barnes was 109, Bradman 52 and Australia 252/4. On the Tuesday Bradman gave \"an amazing exhibition in amassing 234 runs \u2013 that is, amazing for one who was supposed to be a cripple. He played all the shots, pulled leg muscle and all, and often ran between the wickets with the speed of an Olympic sprinter\". Forced to play off the back foot due to his pulled leg muscle Bradman still looked like he had three strokes for every one of Barnes and by the end of the day had caught him up in runs. During this long partnership Len Hutton joked with the crowd on the boundary and ate 14 bananas given to him from the Hill.pp. 81\u201382, Cary In desperation Hammond called on his vice-captain Norman Yardley to bowl his medium pacers, which he did not even do for Yorkshire, and to everyone's surprise he caught Bradman lbw for 234. It was only the second time Bradman had been lbw in a Test against England, the first being to Maurice Tate on his debut in 1928.p. 63, Cary He had added 405 for the fifth wicket with Barnes, and in 1946 this was the highest partnership for that wicket in Test or first-class cricket and the second highest Test partnership after the 451 Bradman-Ponsford partnership at the Oval in 1934. In the next over Barnes hit Bedser to Ikin also for 234, his maiden Test century and the highest score of his career. He said later that he had got himself out so as to have the same score as Bradman \"which could well have been so for he was a man of quixotic mood and temperament\". However, Alec Bedser wrote \"It was when I was bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first discovered that I could move the ball to leg by use of my wrist and fingers...I held the ball in the same manner as a leg-break bowler with the fingers across the seam...and on pitching I was surprised to see the ball go away like a leg-break.

Resuming in the morning Lindwall (2/62) had Erich lbw for 89, much to his disappointment as like McCool he had been promised \u00a31 a run if he made a century. Edrich had now made the highest score in the last three England innings (71, 119 and 89) and had returned the best figures in the last two Australian innings (3/79 and 3/50) and looked good for a big score. When he returned to the England dressing room he complained that he had hit the ball into his pads and should not have been out. This was overheard by an English pressman and was widely reported, becoming a major point of contention, especially as Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at Umpire Scott in disbelief before his walked off.p. 36, Cary Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland, who then caught and bowled Cyril Washbrook for 62 and England had collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5.

David Watt (85) and Morgan Herbet (53) made 118 for the fifth wicket as Peter Smith (4/132) and Doug Wright (4/55) trundled their way through the batting order. Bill Voce (2/75) picked up a couple of late wickets and Western Australia were out for 366 on the second morning. Gibb and Washbrook opened again, but it was Jack Ikin (66) and Joe Hardstaff (53) who made the early runs, followed by Wally Hammond's 208. This was Hammond's 36th double hundred, overtaking Don Bradman's record and this early indication of good form gave the Australians some worries (Bradman retook the record in 1947-48). He added 71 with Norman Yardley (31) and 149 with Smith (46) as the MCC made 477 in 478 minutes. Due to the rain this only left 46 minutes for the WA second innings and they made a safe 48/1. 19,500 people watched the game with \u00a31,809 in receipts.", "...the captain was sarcastic about Denis's 'capering about' outside his crease and rubbed in the point by turning to Jack Ikin and commending him for sticking in his ground. 'Let the ball come to you, that's the way to play out here.' Denis, from whom I had the story, was much deflated - he was, in fact, stumped for 98...The oracle was listened to with great respect, and his dictum was largely taken up by those who followed him in the England XIs - especially by Hutton, who was a fine enough technician to play slow bowling without coming out to meet it. To the ordinary mortal it is fatal to so surrender the initiative to slow bowling.pp52-53, Swanton", "To help Western Australia play the MCC on more even terms, and show some Australian talent to the Perth crowd Sid Barnes of New South Wales, Ken Meuleman and Ian Johnson of Victoria and Bruce Dooland of South Australia were sent over to make up a Combined XI. Robinson won the toss again and they made 462 with David Watt making 157. Barnes and Allan Edwards both made 45 and Johnson 87. The MCC bowling looked plain, but Jack Ikin's leg-spin was tested with old fashioned figures of 4/172. From this Hammond concluded that he wasn't a true all-rounder and thereafter used him in the minor games and rarely in the Tests. Every MCC match of the tour was rain-affected and the game finished when the tourists completed their first innings of 308. Cyril Washbrook (80) and Denis Compton (98) added 123 against the spin of Johnson (3/76) and Dooland (4/88) which they were seeing for the first time; \"It was amazing to see Compton occasionally run down the pitch, change his mind, and either play the ball like a baseball bunt, or scamper back to ground his bat in time to get the benefit of the doubt on a stumping appeal\".p175, Cary Hammond was scathing of Compton's habit of walking down the wicket to the slow bowlers and his instructions to his batsmen to stay within the crease to the spinners made them play as if nailed to the wicket in the Tests with dire consequences. In fairness Hammond had made many runs in Australia that way, but in 1928-29 when Australia had no decent spinners and Australians themselves are brought up to use their feet against the slow men.p62, Swanton 24,500 came to watch the match with receipts of \u00a31,832.", "The game against South Australia caused much interest as Don Bradman played his first match of the season after almost a year without top flight cricket and speculation about his health. Alec Bedser sat in the stands with Bradman's son John, but Hammond won the toss and chose to bat. After the warning not to caper about the wicket at Perth Len Hutton (136) and Cyril Washbrook (113) spent five hours adding 235 runs for the first wicket with \"the eternal pushing of half-volleys and the gentle nudging of longhops from noon to dark\".p57, Swanton Against a fairly toothless attack in which Bruce Dooland was the best bowler with 3/146 Bill Edrich and Denis Compton both made 71 in a stand of 111 and Norman Yardley (54 not out) and Jack Ikin (35 not out) took the score to 506/5 before the declaration at the close of the second day. Bradman came in at 26/2 and after he was dropped by Godfrey Evans played a careful innings of 76. He added 83 with Phil Ridings (57) and 90 with Ron James (58) before he was caught and bowled by Peter Smith (5/93). The tail collapsed from 199/3 to 262/9 at stumps with James Langridge taking 3/60 and Hammond enforced the follow on when they were dismissed for 266. Reginald Craig made 111 and Bradman only 3, but John Mann helped save the day with 62 not out, adding 92 with Craig and 42 runs with Geff Noblet (25 not out). South Australia avoided an innings defeat with 276/8 and the game was drawn. 42,144 attended with receipts of \u00a33,194.", "Lindsay Hassett's Victoria was a tougher proposition, and they would win the Sheffield Shield for the 17th time that season. Yardley won the toss and batted, but they struggled against an attack of near Test strength; Bill Johnston, Fred Freer, Ian Johnson, George Tribe and Doug Ring. Washbrook was out for a duck, Gibb 22 and Hutton and Hardstaff 15 each, but Denis Compton made 143, added 119 with Norman Yardley (70), then carried on batting with the tail. The Victorian bowlers shared the wickets and the MCC were out for 358 early on the second morning. Before stumps Victoria were out for 189 thanks to Bill Voce (3/48) and Doug Wright (6/48). Hassett top scored with a stonewalling 57 until he went to Jack Ikin (1/18) and Yardley sent in his batsmen at the end of the day rather than enforce the follow on. Nobody made more than 21 except for Len Hutton with 151 not out \"He defended superbly against balls which jumped alarmingly or spun viciously across the wicket, and flayed all that was loose\".p78, Cary Johnson took 4/38 and Yardley declared on 279/7, leaving Victoria 449 to win on a dusty pitch. Hassett scored 57 again as did Merv Harvey, but Wright took 4/73 to give him 10 wickets in the match, Alec Bedser took 3/40 and Hutton bowled the opener Gordon Tamblyn with his leg-spin. Victoria were out for 204 runs and the MCC won by 224 runs - their only first class victory of the tour. They were helped by the pitch not having fully recovered from the Aussie Rules football season, even though they dropped catches innumerable.pp78-79, Carypp57-58, Swanton 64,322 attended with receipts of \u00a36,176", "Like Western Australia Tasmania were a weak side and they were sent some help from the mainland to play the MCC and showcase the talents of some star players; Lindsay Hassett, Keith Miller and Ian Johnson of Victoria and Sid Barnes of New South Wales. Wally Hammond preferred to stay in Melbourne, which was seen as a slight to the state, while his overworked bowlers had to go. Major Howard replied that Hammond was badly in need of a rest and that Wright and Bedser were given to option of resting in Melbourne, but chose to go to Tasmania. When Hammond was unable to play in the Fifth Test it was thought that it was illness that kept him in Melbourne. Norman Yardley won the toss and batted, the MCC making 278 on the first day. Laurie Fishlock held the early innings together with 52 as they crashed to 53/4 with Bill Edrich (82), Alec Bedser (51) - his first first class 50 - and Godfrey Evans (34) hoisting up the lower order. They were asked to restrain themselves from hitting sixes due to the glass shortage, but the Tasmanian captain Ron Morrisby was not asked and the opener Ron Thomas twice lifted Dick Pollard over the ropes in his innings of 16 at the end of the day, though no windows were broken. Morrisby was also out for 16, but Barnes made 57, Hassett 35 and Miller 70 with the wicketkeeper Gardiner hitting 94 batting at number 9. Pollard was hit for 2/124 off 20 overs and the Combined XI hit 374 in 250 minutes. Coming in 96 runs behind on the first innings Fishlock (46) and Hardstaff (60) added 91 for the second wicket, then Denis Compton struck 124, his first innings of note since the start of the tour. Jack Ikin (50) helped him add 168 for the fourth wicket and Yardley declared on 353/9. The task of making 258 runs in under two hours was not seriously attempted, but Ian Johnson came in at number three and hit an unbeaten 80 out of 145/2.p98-101, Cary 18,700 attended the game with \u00a32,718 in receipts.", "Some of the oldest grade clubs in Australia are in Tasmania, but it was a weak state side that would not fully complete in the Sheffield Shield for another 25 years. With the Australian Test players returning home the MCC ran up 361/3 on the first day after winning the toss. Hutton gave a sound start with 51, but Joe Hardstaff (155) and Denis Compton (163) stroked their way through a stand of 282. The second day was rain-affected and Yardley declared at 467/5 to give him the chance of dismissing Tasmania twice in a day. Bill Voce (2/7), Bill Edrich (4/26) and Jack Ikin (3/17) ran through their first innings and only Julian Murflett's 46 not out from number 9 brought them up from 49/8 to 103 all out.

Test cricket was not filmed except for highlights and the notion of Test umpires using slow-motion replays or other modern techniques would have been considered absurd. Instead the umpires had to make judgements based on what they saw in a split-second, and honest mistakes were accepted as part and parcel of the game. However, touring teams sometimes felt that there was a natural bias towards the home team which led to some acrimony if important decisions always went against them. The Australian Ray Robinson wrote in The Cricketer:", "Bradman had only made 28, when he played Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it high in the air in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to me sitting watching from the dressing room.
