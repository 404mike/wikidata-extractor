She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books paved the way for other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr (\"the galloping gourmet\"), and Robert Carrier."]}, {"page": "Helena Bonham Carter", "response": ["Bonham Carter signed to play author Enid Blyton in the BBC Four television biopic, Enid.
