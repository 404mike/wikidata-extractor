Rignold however was seen as bringing stability after the turbulence of the Panufnik era and Boult's stopgap year. The last players remaining from the orchestra's first season in 1920 had retired by 1967, and Rignold proved an astute judge of musicians, introducing many excellent young players to the orchestra and improving professionalism and discipline. He demanded high standards and audiences experienced noticeable improvements. By 1963 the orchestra was seeing much improved reviews in the London press. The growing prestige of the CBSO made it easier to attract international artists: soloists at CBSO concerts included Wilhelm Kempff, Clifford Curzon, Ida Haendel, Paul Tortelier, Isaac Stern and Mstislav Rostropovich; and notable guest conductors included Antal Dorati, Jascha Horenstein, Rudolf Kempe, Ferdinand Leitner and Nadia Boulanger, who conducted a programme of works by her sister Lili Boulanger."]}, {"page": "1928 in music", "response": ["*December 15 \u2013 Ida Haendel, violinist (died 2020)"]}, {"page": "Violin Concerto (Beethoven)", "response": ["*1957: Ida Haendel, Czech Philharmonic, Karel An\u010derl, Suraphon \u2013 14 May 2010."]}, {"page": "Swan Lake", "response": ["| 1976 || Andr\u00e9 Previn || London Symphony Orchestra || with Ida Haendel, violin"]}, {"page": "Carl Flesch", "response": ["He was known for his solo performances in a very wide range of repertoire (from Baroque music to contemporary), gaining fame as a chamber music performer.
