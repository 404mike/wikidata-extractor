Born in Canada but raised in Northern Ireland, Lindsay pursued a career as a history academic before becoming associated with the Ulster Vanguard tendency of unionism. He took a leading role in the tendency within the Vanguard that supported a diminished role for the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland and produced the Dominion of Ulster, outlining his views, in 1972.\nLindsay would subsequently lead two political parties advocating his dominion idea but failed to gain much support. He largely left active politics in his later life to concentrate on writing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ulster nationalism", "response": ["Some members of the Ulster Vanguard movement, led by Bill Craig, in the early 1970s published similar arguments, most notably Professor Kennedy Lindsay. In the early 1970s, in the face of the British government prorogation of the government of Northern Ireland, Craig, Lindsay and others argued in favour of a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) from Great Britain similar to that declared in Rhodesia a few years previously. Lindsay later founded the British Ulster Dominion Party to this end but it faded into obscurity around 1979."]}, {"page": "Ulster Workers' Council strike", "response": ["For a time the UDA looked to this spirit of Ulster nationalism for its own policy, with Glenn Barr, Andy Tyrie, Tommy Lyttle and Harry Chicken spearheading an initiative in this direction which culminated in the production of the 1979 New Ulster Political Research Group document Beyond the Religious Divide, which drew up a blueprint for a negotiated independence for Northern Ireland, as well as a framework constitution for the new state.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 103 The idea however failed to take off as the UDA was unable to challenge the hegemony of the political parties and it was only in the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party that there existed any sympathy for the notion of independence.Kennedy Lindsay, Dominion of Ulster , 1972 The UVF formed a Volunteer Political Party soon after the strike and this group, which rejected Ulster nationalism, suffered similar problems to the politicising UDA as it too failed to make any inroads into the support of the established unionist parties.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Poolbeg, 1997, pp. 151\u2013152"]}, {"page": "British Ulster Dominion Party", "response": ["The party began in 1975 as the Ulster Dominion Group, when Professor Kennedy Lindsay broke from the United Ulster Unionist movement (which would later emerge as the United Ulster Unionist Party), itself a breakaway from the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party to form a new group that would fully support the idea of Dominion status for Northern Ireland.

Rumours circulated that this group was in fact the UVF and that they had gone over to communism, although in fact the Ulster Citizens Army had never existed and was simply black propaganda spread by the British Army press office in Lisburn, known colloquially as the \"Lisburn Lie Machine\".Cusack & McDonald, UVF, pp. 149\u2013150 For their part the UVF issued a statement in their magazine Combat stating that they and the VPP were opposed to \"all shades of communism, socialism and liberalism\".Cusack & McDonald, UVF, p. 150 Gibson also disavowed the Ulster nationalist ideas being proposed by the likes of Glenn Barr and Kennedy Lindsay at the time, arguing that Northern Ireland was too small to be economically viable as an independent state.Ronnie Hanna, The Union: Essays on Ireland and the British Connection, Colourpoint, 2001, p. 80 Gibson, out of frustration with his party's inability to win support from ordinary, working-class people, hit the table one night shouting: \"Scum, rats [the politicians and Orangemen] 'I've told the people out there, but they're afraid.
