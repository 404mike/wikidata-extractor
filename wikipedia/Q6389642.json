Born in Canada but raised in Northern Ireland, Lindsay pursued a career as a history academic before becoming associated with the Ulster Vanguard tendency of unionism. He took a leading role in the tendency within the Vanguard that supported a diminished role for the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland and produced the Dominion of Ulster, outlining his views, in 1972.\nLindsay would subsequently lead two political parties advocating his dominion idea but failed to gain much support. He largely left active politics in his later life to concentrate on writing.", "link_mentions": {}}}
