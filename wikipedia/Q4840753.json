On 6 December Bl\u00e9riot managed two flights of over 500 metres, including a successful U-turn. This was the most impressive achievement to date of any of the French pioneer aviators, causing Patrick Alexander to write to Major Baden Baden-Powell, president of the Royal Aeronautical Society, \"I got back from Paris last night. I think Bl\u00e9riot with his new machine is leading the way\".

The man-carrying kite was developed a stage further in 1894 by Captain Baden Baden-Powell, brother of Lord Baden-Powell, who strung a chain of hexagonal kites on a single line. A significant development came in 1893 when the Australian Lawrence Hargrave invented the box kite and some man-carrying experiments were carried out both in Australia and in the United States.Walker (1971) Volume I.

Edited by Hugh Chisholm in London and by Franklin Henry Hooper in New York, the 11th edition was the first to be published substantially at one time, instead of volume by volume. Its illustrious contributors are legion, including Baden Baden-Powell writing on kite-flying; Arthur Eddington on astronomy; Edmund Gosse on literature and Donald Tovey on music. Sometimes called the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, this edition is still highly regarded for its lucid explanations of scholarly subjects. Being in the public domain, the complete text is freely available online.There are many places the encyclopedia can be accessed online (see the External links section of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition article). The 11th edition retained the high scholarship and eminent contributors that marked the 9th edition, but tempered that scholarship with shorter, simpler articles that were more intelligible to lay-readers. Thus, the 9th and 11th editions had 17,000 and 40,000 articles, respectively, although they were roughly equivalent in size. This shift accommodated the American business strategy of popularizing the Britannica for a mass market, while still retaining its quality as a reference work. The high literary and scholarly level of the 11th edition is largely due to the zeal of its owner, Horace Everett Hooper, who held scholarship in high regard and spared no expense to make the 11th edition as excellent as possible."]}, {"page": "Robert Baden-Powell, 3rd Baron Baden-Powell", "response": ["Robert1  3  3  5  2  4  2  6  1 12  1  1        BADEN-POWELL, Robert (Crause) - halfway down the page at  was a great-nephew of Agnes Baden-Powell, Baden Baden-Powell, George Baden-Powell, and Warington Baden-Powell, and a great-grandson of the Rev.
