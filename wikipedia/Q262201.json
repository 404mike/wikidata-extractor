She later went on to say before the 2017 United Kingdom general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that \"no deal is better than a bad deal. We have to be prepared to walk out\". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was \"disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market.\" Phil Wilson for the Open Britain group said, \"It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position.\""]}, {"page": "Eric Joyce", "response": ["Joyce was arrested at 22:50 on 22 February 2012 in the Palace of Westminster by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of committing assault.
