He presented BBC One's Points of View between 1965 and 1969, and was the second of three Robinsons to present the programme (immediately following and preceding a returning Robert Robinson, and before Anne Robinson); he was fired from that programme due to the show's producer objecting to the frivolous way in which he referred to bananas. He had a stint as a presenter of religious programmes, but the producer found his tone too ironic for the subject matter. In 1971 he became a guest panellist and occasional host of BBC Radio 4's Start the Week and hosted its children's spin-off, If It's Wednesday It Must Be\u2026. He was notorious for acerbity, particularly towards women; he rowed with Anna Raeburn and Esther Rantzen, brought Angela Rippon to tears after dismantling her book about horses and disgusted Pamela Stephenson enough for her to empty her water down his neck. He was suspended for six weeks in 1984 for making a joke about disabled people's sex lives (that a disabled people's dating agency would mean \"you could hear the wheelchairs banging all night in some parts of the country\"), for which the BBC issued a grovelling apology, and was fired on-air in 1986. In addition, he had a stage show, The Worst of Kenneth Robinson, a compilation programme of which, The Best of the Worst of Kenneth Robinson, aired on ITV in January 1975.
