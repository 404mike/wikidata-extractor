The team remained unchanged through the first four games of the campaign, which were all won, before Latta missed the fifth game. Everton still won to take their winning start to five games before being held to a 2\u20132 draw at Aston Villa. Everton remained unbeaten for their first seven games but their first choice eleven did not play again as a run of three straight defeats saw the return of Robert Smalley for one game in place of Jack Angus before David Jardine was signed in November from Bootle."]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["Bob Howarth was the biggest name to leave Goodison Park during the summer as he returned to Preston North End. This gave Charlie Parry the chance to win back the left back shirt that he had lost when Howarth had arrived two years earlier. Reserve goalkeepers, John Whitehead and David Jardine both moved on, to Liverpool and Nelson respectively to seemingly cement Richard Williams' place between the posts. Two other fringe players, defender, Billy Lindsay and half back, Jack Walker left in search of regular first team football at Grimsby and Ardwick respectively. The only major inclusion to the first team squad was the signing of Tom McInnes from Scottish side Third Lanark. He instantly slotted into the inside right birth while Jack Bell moved out to outside left with Alf Milward making way."]}, {"page": "John Angus (footballer, born 1867)", "response": ["Angus was replaced in goal by Bob Smalley for a 2\u20131 reverse at Ewood Park versus Blackburn, but returned to keep a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 home win over Sunderland, a result which restored Everton's position at the top of the table. Angus's final league appearance for Everton came a week later, in a 2\u20130 defeat at Deepdale versus the mighty Preston side who had won the previous two Division 1 titles and would push Everton all the way in 1890/91. Angus received a kick to the knee in the Preston match, and fellow Scot David Jardine took his place for the following fixture at home to Blackburn. Jardine would keep goal for Everton in the remaining ten league fixtures, helping his side to claim their first league championship title in the process."]}, {"page": "David Jardine", "response": ["David Jardine may refer to:", "* David Jardine (barrister) (1794\u20131860), English barrister and magistrate", "* David Jardine (footballer) (1867-?), Scottish football goalkeeper", "* David Jardine (merchant) (1818\u20131856), taipan of the Jardine, Matheson & Co.", "* David Jardine Jardine (1847\u20131922), Scottish landowner and racehorse owner"]}]}}
