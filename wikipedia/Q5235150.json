He first came to India in 1943 while serving with the Royal Air Force. He felt very much at home in the region and was moved by the poverty and poor educational opportunities for rural children he encountered while living in a small village in the North East. After the war, on his return to the UK he vowed to return to India and become involved in education. He studied in England at the University of London - SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies) and returned to India to work as a teacher of English, first in Mysore and then at Rishi Valley School. He also worked with the British Council in India and the National Council of Educational Research and Training. He later founded a school, Neel Bagh in Kolar district - about 100 km outside Bangalore. He is known for his contributions to the area of educational reform, especially the introduction of Activity-based learning.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rishi Valley School", "response": ["Within two years the school was running well with 110 fee-paying boarders as well as a waiting list for admissions. The student population was growing more diverse with 80% of students coming from northern, western and eastern India as well as some from overseas. Two of the best teachers at this time were David Horsburgh and Sardar Mohammad.", "A lot of practices were also introduced during this period that are still followed in the school. Students could learn classical North Indian and South Indian music. Local folk dancing was brought in by David Horsburgh. Hiking, trekking and camping were also encouraged and teachers would often accompany students. One of Pearce's long lasting innovations at Rishi Valley was his introduction of 'astachal'. Children would gather together every evening, to sit quietly while the sun was setting on the Astachal hill. It was a time which gave children the opportunity for quiet reflection.", "Mr.Pearce resigned in October 1958 due to differences with the Rishi Valley Trust as well as Krishnamurti and went on to found two more schools in India - The Blue Mountain School in Ooty and the Sandur School. Sardar Mohammad joined Mr. Pearce in Blue Mountain School after he left Rishi Valley. David Horsburgh started his own school Neel Bagh in Kolar district - about 100\u00a0km outside Bangalore.", "An American teacher, David Young, introduced Western folk dancing to the school. Later, another teacher, David Horsburgh, introduced European and American folk dancing. Folk dancing, or 'folkie' as students call it, is held once a week. The senior students teach the dances to the junior students. Over the years, the dances have evolved and visiting alumni usually join in."]}, {"page": "Activity-based learning in India", "response": ["thumb|225px|left|David Horsburgh: Pioneer of Activity-based learning", "Activity-based learning (ABL) started in 1944 amid World War II when David Horsburgh, an innovative British thinker and charismatic leader, came to India and decided to settle there. He started teaching at Rishi Valley School. He joined the British Council and worked in Chennai and Bangalore for many years. After his retirement, he relocated to a  site in Kolar District and opened a school named Neel Bagh. The school was based on Horsburgh's innovative ideas and is known for creative teaching methods and well-planned learning materials. With his wife Doreen and son Nicholas, Horsburgh developed a diverse curriculum that added music, carpentry, sewing, masonry, and gardening to the usual school subjects of English, Mathematics, Sanskrit, and Telugu. These pedagogic materials were systematically planned, incorporating sketches, drawings, and an occasional touch of humour. Later, Horsburgh created a magnificent library in Neel Baugh, accessible to teachers and students. Horsburgh's initiative later proved to be a pioneering milestone in ABL. Since 2003, the ABL method has been applied in Corporation schools of Chennai, India, providing specialised education for children who had been freed from bonded labour."]}, {"page": "Horsburgh, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Horsburgh"]}]}}
