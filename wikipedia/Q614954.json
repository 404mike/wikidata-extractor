He made his debut on 20 September 2005, in a League Cup 1\u20130 defeat at Selhurst Park, replacing Isaac Osbourne on 83 minutes. He made sixteen Championship appearances later in the season, putting in a string of impressive displays in March and April. A fans' favourite due to his exciting style of play, Thornton scored his first goal for the club on 26 August 2006 against Hull City, but an ankle injury marred what seemed destined to be a successful season, limiting him to just 13 appearances. The Irishman penned a new two-year extension to his contract in May 2007, keeping him at the club until summer 2010. In 2007\u201308 he was limited to twenty appearances and continued to be used mainly as a substitute.
