Leeds signed Jack Butland on loan who went straight into the first team and made his debut in a 0\u20130 draw with Middlesbrough, where he received the man of the match award. Kenny wasn't named in a matchday squad after the signing of Jack Butland, with goalkeeper Alex Cairns favoured ahead of Kenny as the club's second choice goalkeeper. On 25 April, Kenny's agents brought out a statement confirming that Kenny was fit and available for selection despite his absence from the matchday squads. On 30 June 2014, Kenny was left out of Leeds' two week pre-season training camp to Santa Cristina in Italy. On 3 July, the Professional Footballers' Association investigated alleged media reports that Kenny had been dropped due to his birthdate falling on the 17th of a month, with owner Massimo Cellino having a deep superstition of the number 17. However, Kenny's agent Paul Masterton, laughed off the claims that Kenny had been dropped due to his birthdate falling on the 17th of a month. On the same day, Leeds signed goalkeeper Stuart Taylor increasing speculation about Kenny's long-term future at the club."]}, {"page": "Chris Neal", "response": ["Neal signed a two-year contract with League One club Fleetwood Town in May 2016, and joined the club shortly after the departure of Chris Maxwell.

However he lost his first team place to Alex Cairns in November; manager Uwe R\u00f6sler admitted that the situation was a \"little bit harsh on Chris Neal because Chris Neal did nothing wrong\" and it was Cairns's strong form that made him undroppable. On 6 January 2018, he kept a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw with Leicester City in the Third Round of the FA Cup, and was rewarded with a year's supply of pizza from sponsors Papa John's Pizza.
