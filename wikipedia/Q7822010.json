The new line-up now had Barry Hewitt on bass, Tony McIntyre on drums, Steve Marriott on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Johnny Weider (ex Johnny Kidd and the Pirates) on lead guitar and Allen Ellett on keyboards and vocals. They soon became more R&B influenced and found a manager, Tony Calder (who several years later established the Immediate label with Andrew Loog Oldham.

In the event, Oldham travelled to the United States to avoid possible arrest himself. He believed, suggests Trynka, that having arrested the bandmembers, police would start coming after their management. His business partner Tony Calder later commented, \"I never saw a man pack his bags so quickly. He was terrified.\" As a result, Oldham was mostly out of the country over the next three months: the Stones, says Trynka, \"saw this as cowardice\". Instead, Allen Klein attended to the publicity surrounding the arrests, coordinating the group's defence, while the band went to Morocco to escape the press.  Oldham later explained that \"I was already not dealing with a completely full deck, but if you have five policemen in your house, you\u2019ve got a good reason to think you're going to end up in jail. So I left the country\"."]}]}}
