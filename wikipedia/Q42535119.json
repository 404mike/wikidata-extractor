D'Arlhac took over the directorship of Le M\u00e9nestrel in July 1835, but relinquished it the following March to the journalist and critic Jules Lovy, who had been a writer for the journal since its foundation. By 1836, Le M\u00e9nestrel had a weekly print run of 600 copies, although as Katharine Ellis pointed out, the number of actual readers was probably much larger. At the time, Paris alone had over 500 cabinets de lecture, private reading rooms and precursors to the modern library, popular in early 19th-century France, where for a small fee the public could read the latest issues of newspapers and journals.Ellis (2007), pp. 1-2 and 268\u2013269.Martyn Lyons, Books: A Living History (Los Angeles: J.

In 1840, the newly formed music publishing partnership of Jacques-L\u00e9opold Heugel and Jean-Antoine Meissonnier acquired Le M\u00e9nestrel. Heugel became the director, and Jules Lovy stayed on as editor-in-chief until his death in 1863. Lovy was succeeded by the critic and music historian Joseph d'Ortigue. Later editors-in-chief included Arthur Pougin who served from 1885 to 1921.Watanabe (1948). However, after d'Ortigue's death in 1866, only the Heugel name appeared on the masthead. When Jacques-L\u00e9opold died in 1883, his son Henri-Georges Heugel took over as director. He was in turn succeeded by his own son Jacques-Paul who served as the director for the remainder of the journal's existence.Le M\u00e9nestrel, 3 February 1933, p. 52; Feurzeig (1994), p. 126; Nichols and Drake (2001)."]}, {"page": "F\u00e9lix Danjou", "response": ["Danjou was organist at Church of Notre-Dame-des-Blancs-Manteaux 1831\u201334,Fenner Douglass, Cavaill\u00e9-Coll and the Musicians, volume 1 (1980): \"Jean-Louis-Felix Danjou (1812\u201366), a Parisian, began his career as organist at age seventeen for the church of Notre-Dame-des-Blancs-Manteaux, having earlier been taught by the clergy of that parish, then by Benott at the ...\"Katharine Ellis, Interpreting the Musical Past: Early Music in Nineteenth-Century (2008), p. 258: \"F\u00e9lix Danjou (1812\u20131866): Organist at Notre-Dame-des-Blancs-Manteaux (1831\u201334); Saint-Eustache (1834\u201344); Notre Dame de Paris (1840\u201347).
