P88. January 1993 Yet, from a professional and personal point of view, both films were significant challenges for Binoche; her casting opposite Ralph Fiennes's Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights, instead of English actresses Helena Bonham Carter and Kate Beckinsale, was immediately contentious and drew derision from the British press, unimpressed that a uniquely English role had gone to a French actress. The film had its world premiere at the 1992 Edinburgh International Film Festival. Reviews were poor, with Binoche being cynically dubbed \"Cathy Clouseau\" and derided for her \"franglais\" accent. Both Binoche and director Peter Kosminsky distanced themselves from the film, with Binoche refusing to do any promotion for the film or to redub it into French.Quoted in feature article Premi\u00e8re Magazine No 222, 09/1995", "| Peter Kosminsky"]}, {"page": "Michelle Pfeiffer", "response": ["| Peter Kosminsky"]}, {"page": "King David Hotel bombing", "response": ["* The Promise (2001), a British television serial in four episodes written and directed by Peter Kosminsky"]}, {"page": "2002 in film", "response": ["| White Oleander || Warner Bros.
