Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 for the Duke of Argyll, with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets. The architectural historian John Gifford writes that the castellations were the \"symbolic assertion of the still quasi-feudal power [the duke] exercised over the inhabitants within his heritable jurisdictions\". Most buildings were still largely in the established Palladian style, but some houses incorporated external features of the Scots baronial style. Robert Adam's houses in this style include Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton Castle in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. The eccentric landscape designer Batty Langley even attempted to \"improve\" Gothic forms by giving them classical proportions."]}, {"page": "Mansion House, London", "response": ["Mansion House was built between the years of 1739 and 1752, in the Palladian style by the surveyor and architect George Dance the Elder. The site, at the east end of Poultry, London, had  previously been occupied by the Stocks Market, which by the time of its closure was mostly used for the sale of herbs. The construction was prompted by a wish to put an end to the inconvenient practice of lodging the Lord Mayor in one of the City Halls. Dance won a competition over designs solicited from James Gibbs and Giacomo Leoni, and uninvited submissions by Batty Langley and Isaac Ware. Construction was slowed down by the discovery of springs on the site, which meant piles had to be sunk to lay adequate foundations."]}, {"page": "1690s in architecture", "response": ["* 1696: September 14 (bapt.) \u2013 Batty Langley, English garden architect (died 1751)"]}, {"page": "Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens", "response": ["The Holly Maze is a mirror image of the one at Hampton Court Palace designed by George London and Henry Wise.
