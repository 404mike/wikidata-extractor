He first played in the Football League in 1947\u201348. However Wolves were then at the start of a period of dominance in the First Division and  Kelly was not a regular first team player; he made 60 league appearances in three seasons. In October 1950 he was persuaded to move to Huddersfield who had had difficulties with the left back position. He made the position his own for the next six years, during which he was a member of the Huddersfield Town defence which was ever-present through the 1952\u201353 season. He made 239 first team appearances in all, playing five seasons in the First Division and two in the Second. Huddersfield also reached the quarter-final of the F.A. Cup during this period.\nIn 1956\u201357 it was Huddersfield's policy to reduce the average age of the team and Kelly lost his place to the up-and-coming Ray Wilson. At the end of the season he moved to play for and manage non-league club Nuneaton Borough. He resigned from that post in December 1958.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bill McGarry", "response": ["\"Terriers\" manager George Stephenson bought McGarry to play in a defensive partnership with Laurie Kelly. He built a reputation as a tough-tackling, sturdy wing-half, and featured ten times towards the end of the 1950\u201351 season. He then scored twice in 43 games in 1951\u201352, as Huddersfield suffered relegation. New boss Andy Beattie led the club to immediate promotion out of the Second Division with a second-place finish in 1952\u201353. McGarry played all 44 games, in an extremely settled defence that featured himself, Kelly, Don McEvoy, Len Quested, Ron Staniforth, and goalkeeper Jack Wheeler; remarkably, the six men played every minute of the campaign, and had the best defensive record in the Football League with just 33 goals conceded in 42 league games. Town's solid defence then helped them to finish third in the top-flight in 1953\u201354, just six points behind champions Wolverhampton Wanderers; McGarry was again an ever-present, scoring four goals in 43 appearances. He then scored once in 38 games in 1954\u201355, as Town posted a 12th-place finish. He then scored four goals in 41 games in 1955\u201356, as their once solid defence leaked goals and cost them relegation as they finished below 20th place Aston Villa on goal average. Bill Shankly took charge at Leeds Road in November 1956, and took the club to 12th in the Second Division in 1956\u201357; he kept faith with McGarry, who scored twice in 36 appearances. He scored six goals in 36 games in 1957\u201358, as Huddersfield rose slightly to ninth place. His goal tally included a successfully converted penalty in the 7\u20136 defeat to Charlton Athletic at The Valley on 21 December; ten-man Charlton came back from 5\u20131 down in what The Guardian described as \"the most remarkable comeback in football history\". They then dropped down to 14th in 1958\u201359, with McGarry scoring four goals in 32 games. He scored once in 38 games in 1959\u201360; Town posted a sixth-place finish under new boss Eddie Boot, who took charge after Shankly left the club to manage Liverpool. McGarry scored once in 20 appearances in 1960\u201361, as Town dropped down to 20th place."]}, {"page": "Jack Wheeler (footballer, born 1919)", "response": ["Wheeler had to spend some time in the reserves before becoming a first-team regular at Huddersfield.
