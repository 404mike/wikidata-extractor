Scotland immediately responded; Alan Morton received the ball on the left wing and crossed for Alex Jackson to head in the opening goal after just three minutes. The performances of Morton and Jackson on the wings forced English defenders wide to combat them, which left space for Dunn, Gallacher, and James to exploit. A resolute performance by the English defence kept Scotland at bay for most of the first half, but with just one minute remaining before half-time, Alex James beat Ted Hufton in the England goal with a left foot shot.", "What followed in the second half was one of the most memorable 45 minutes in Scottish football history. Conditions did not improve and, yet, somehow, the Scots raised their game further, dominating the play. The third Scottish goal, 20 minutes into the second half, was similar to their first, as Morton took the ball almost to the corner flag before sending over another precision cross which Jackson met with his head. Moments after this third goal, James made the score 0\u20134, ably assisted by Gallacher. Jackson converted another cross from Morton with five minutes left on the clock to complete his hat-trick and to make the score 0\u20135. England were well beaten, but to their credit, they did not give up trying. With a minute to go, Bob Kelly struck a free-kick past Jack Harkness to make the final score England 1, Scotland 5. At the end of the game the rain-sodden crowd applauded the performance.", "|GK ||1 ||Jack Harkness (Queen's Park)", "The Wizards were never selected again en masse for an international match. Tom Bradshaw never played another game for Scotland, despite effectively marking Dixie Dean out of the game. Bradshaw was the last surviving member of the victorious Scotland side, dying in February 1986 at the age of 82, four months after the death of goalkeeper Jack Harkness at the age of 78. The last survivor from the losing side was Joe Hulme, who died in September 1991 at the age of 87."]}, {"page": "Jack Harkness (disambiguation)", "response": ["Jack Harkness is a character played by John Barrowman in Doctor Who and Torchwood.", "Jack Harkness may also refer to:", "* \"Captain Jack Harkness\" (Torchwood episode), an episode of Torchwood", "** Jack Harkness, played by Matt Rippy, a minor Torchwood character", "* Jack Harkness (footballer) (1907\u20131985), Scottish footballer", "* Jack Harkness (1918\u20131994), rose breeder with Harkness Roses"]}, {"page": "List of Heart of Midlothian F.C. players", "response": ["|Jack Harkness, London Hearts Supporters Club"]}, {"page": "John Niven (footballer)", "response": ["Niven first signed for East Fife in 1942, after being spotted by East Fife manager John McArthur.
