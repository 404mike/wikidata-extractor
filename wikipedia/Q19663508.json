The Ariella label came to prominence during the British fashion revolution, and was known for their evening, cocktail and occasionwear and casino uniforms.Aristos opened a workshop upstairs at 45 Carnaby Street in 1966, and used the label \u2018designed by Aristos\u2019. In 1971, he was joined by his brother Achilleas, who runs the company to this day. Together they expanded the business to Duke Street, Oxford Street, Newburgh Street and more on Carnaby Street. They grew rapidly and began to supply their clothes wholesale to larger retailers such as Jane Norman, DH Evans and John Lewis. By 1974 they had a headquarters in Marylebone, a showroom in Great Portland Street and nine retail shops including branches in Chicago and Lausanne, Switzerland. They eventually moved to larger headquarters in Wood Green, but the retail side of the business was being overtaken in importance by the wholesale operations.
