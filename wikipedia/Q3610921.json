Stagg continued to claim that the killing was an accident and that he first fired the gun when Ball (allegedly \"under the influence of drink\") started to climb over the gate following an argument. There then followed a fight where Ball tried to wrench the gun away from Stagg; as Stagg fell back, the gun discharged accidentally, killing Ball. Stagg also claimed that Ball had threatened to attack Mrs. Stagg who was watching from a first-floor window: \"I will come up and dash your brains out\" and that Beatrice Ball had later said \"He would not have hurt Mrs. Stagg, although he kicks me about\". This was refuted at the trial by Mrs. Ball who \"emphatically denied\" that her husband had ever hit her. The Aston Villa trainer, Alf Miles, was called as a witness saying that Ball was a \"good living man \u2013 always in the best of condition\"."]}, {"page": "1905 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||  || Alf Miles"]}, {"page": "Alfred Miles", "response": ["*Alf Miles (1884\u20131926), English footballer"]}]}}
