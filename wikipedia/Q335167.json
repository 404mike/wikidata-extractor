He gained American financial support, strongly opposed communism, and aided in the creation of NATO. Bevin was also instrumental to the founding of the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret propaganda wing of the UK Foreign Office which specialised in disinformation, anti-communism, and pro-colonial propaganda. Bevin's tenure also saw the end of British rule in India and the independence of India and Pakistan, as well as the end of the Mandate of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel. His biographer Alan Bullock said that Bevin \"stands as the last of the line of foreign secretaries in the tradition created by Castlereagh, Canning and Palmerston in the first half of the 19th century\".", "At the 1931 general election, Bevin was persuaded by the remaining leaders of the Labour Party to contest Gateshead, on the understanding that if successful he would remain as general secretary of the TGWU. The National Government landslide resulted in Gateshead being lost by a large margin to the Liberal National Thomas Magnay.Alan Bullock, Ernest Bevin: Trade Union Leader 1881 \u2013 1940 (1960) pp. 495\u201397.", "For refusing to remove limits on Jewish immigration to Palestine in the aftermath of the war, Bevin earned the hatred of Zionists. According to historian Howard Sachar, his political foe, Richard Crossman, a fellow Labour Party member of parliament and a pro-Zionist member of the post-war Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into the Problems of European Jewry and Palestine, characterised his outlook during the dying days of the Mandate as \"corresponding roughly with The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", a Tsarist fabrication written to inflame anti-Semitic prejudice. In Sachar's account, Crossman intimated that \"the main points of Bevin's discourse were ... that the Jews had successfully organised a conspiracy against Britain and against him personally.\" Bevin's biographer Alan Bullock rejected suggestions that Bevin was motivated by personal anti-Semitism.", "James Chuter Ede, Home Secretary throughout the time that Bevin was at the Foreign Office (and for a few months after his death), had worked with Churchill, Attlee, Keynes and many other significant figures.  When Bevin's biographer, Alan Bullock, asked Chuter Ede for his view of Bevin, he replied:\"Was he the biggest man I met in the Labour movement? He was the biggest man I met in any movement.\"", "Martin Folly argues that assessments on Bevin as foreign secretary divide into two schools.Martin H.

After the opening of the British archives, historians, led by biographer Alan Bullock celebrated Bevin as one of the great men in British diplomatic history.Peter Weiler, \"Britain and the First Cold War: Revisionist Beginnings,\" Twentieth Century British History 9 (1998), 131; Anne Deighton, The Impossible Peace. Britain, the Division of Germany, and the Origins of the Cold War (1990).  They argued he dominated foreign-policy, led the Foreign Office by strength of character and clarity of vision, and carried through on his grand design for Britain's revised role in world affairs, especially in close alliance with the United States, his support for NATO, and his rejection of an alternative of Britain as a neutral third force as advocated by the left wing of his party. He succeeded in convincing the United States to take over some of Britain's burdens, especially in Greece. He thereby became a major influence in pushing the United States into a leadership role through the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, and the Cold War. However, a revisionist approach appeared in the late 1980s. It portrays Bevin as a narrow-minded anti-Communist and gives  more credit to the Foreign Office for the new foreign-policy. In this interpretation, Bevin lost the opportunity  to make Britain a leader in European affairs, and it instead became more of a tail on the American kite.Peter Weiler, \"Britain and the First Cold War: Revisionist Beginnings', Twentieth Century British History  (1998) 9#1: 127\u2013138; Anne Deighton, The Impossible Peace.

His antisemitism supposedly arose from various esoteric schools of mysticism, and he spent hours with Hitler discussing art and the place of the Jews in world history. Samuel W. Mitcham calls Eckart an \"eccentric intellectual\" and \"extreme anti-Semite\" who was also a \"man of the world\" who liked \"wine, women, and pleasures of the flesh.\" Alan Bullock describes Eckart as having \"violent nationalist, anti-democratic, and anti-clerical opinions, a racist with an enthusiasm for Nordic folklore and a taste for Jew-baiting\" who \"talked well even when he was drunk\" and \"knew everyone in Munich.\" According to Richard J. Evans, Eckart, the \"failed racist poet and dramatist\" blamed his career's failure on Jewish domination of German culture, and defined as \"Jewish\" anything that was subversive or materialistic. Joachim C. Fest describes Eckart as a \"roughhewn and comical figure, with [a] thick round head, [and a] partiality for good wine and crude talk\" with a \"bluff and uncomplicated manner\". His revolutionary goals were to promote \"true socialism\" and rid the country of \"interest slavery\". According to Thomas Weber, Eckart had a \"jovial but moody nature\", while John Toland describes him as \"an original raffish man with a touch of genius\", and \"a tall, bald, burly eccentric who spent much of his time in cafes and beer halls giving equal attention to drink and talk.\" He was \"a born romantic revolutionary ... a master of coffeehouse polemics.

The first major biography of Hitler since that of Alan Bullock in 1952 and the first by a German writer, it appeared at a time when the younger generation of Germans was confronting the legacy of the Nazi period. It sparked controversy among German historians, because Fest, a political conservative, rejected the view, then dominant, that the causes of Hitler's rise to power had been largely economic.
