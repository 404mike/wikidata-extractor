A prominent example is the village shop in Ambridge, the fictional village in the BBC Radio 4 series, The Archers, (1950\u2013present). The ITV1 soap opera Coronation Street (1960\u2013present) has featured a corner shop since the first episode; originally owned by Florrie Lindley, it was later acquired by Alf Roberts the grocer, and after his death in the late-1990s was bought by Dev Alahan, reflecting this common change in British culture to Asian shopkeepers. The dying days and changing culture of the traditional British grocer were explored to great effect in the BBC TV comedy series Open All Hours (1976\u20131985), set in the real suburb of Balby in Doncaster; the shop front used for the street scenes in the series does actually exist in the area and is now a hairdressing salon. The BBC Scotland comedy series Still Game has a corner shop as a recurring location where characters can meet and gossip; the actor who plays its owner, Navid Harrid (Sanjeev Kohli), plays a similar role as Bangaram in the Radio 4 comedy series Fags, Mags and Bags which is set entirely in Ramesh's shop."]}, {"page": "Greg Hemphill", "response": ["In 2014, Still Game returned, with a live show at The SSE Hydro, where Hemphill reunited with Ford Kiernan.
