However women's boxing was hugely controversial. In early 1926, Shoreditch borough council banned an arranged exhibition match between boxers Annie Newton and Madge Baker, a student of Digger Stanley. An attempt to hold the match in nearby Hackney instead was defeated by a campaign led by the Mayor of Hackney, who wrote \"I regard this proposed exhibition of women boxers as a gratification of the sensual ideals of a crowd of vulgar men.\" The Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks was among those opposing the match, claiming \"the Legislature never imagined that such a disgraceful exhibition would have been staged in this country.\" The story was reported across the country and even internationally."]}, {"page": "List of people from the City of Westminster", "response": ["* Annie Newton"]}]}}
