The concept was later popularized by Freeman Dyson in his 1960 paper \"Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation\". Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the escalating energy needs of a technological civilization and would be a necessity for its long-term survival. He proposed that searching for such structures could lead to the detection of advanced, intelligent extraterrestrial life. Different types of Dyson spheres and their energy-harvesting ability would correspond to levels of technological advancement on the Kardashev scale.", "However, Dyson was not the first to advance this idea.

Knut Hamsun counted Nietzsche, along with Strindberg and Dostoyevsky, as his primary influences. Author Jack London wrote that he was more stimulated by Nietzsche than by any other writer. Critics have suggested that the character of David Grief in A Son of the Sun was based on Nietzsche. Nietzsche's influence on Muhammad Iqbal is most evidenced in Asrar-i-Khudi (The Secrets of the Self). Wallace Stevens was another reader of Nietzsche, and elements of Nietzsche's philosophy were found throughout Stevens's poetry collection Harmonium. Olaf Stapledon was influenced by the idea of the \u00dcbermensch and it is a central theme in his books Odd John and Sirius. In Russia, Nietzsche influenced Russian symbolism and figures such as Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Andrei Bely, Vyacheslav Ivanov and Alexander Scriabin incorporated or discussed parts of Nietzsche philosophy in their works. Thomas Mann's novel Death in Venice shows a use of Apollonian and Dionysian, and in Doctor Faustus Nietzsche was a central source for the character of Adrian Leverk\u00fchn. Hermann Hesse, similarly, in his Narcissus and Goldmund presents two main characters as opposite yet intertwined Apollonian and Dionysian spirits. Painter Giovanni Segantini was fascinated by Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and he drew an illustration for the first Italian translation of the book.

Most notably, the British writers tended to minimise the role of individual \"heroes\", took an \"evolutionary perspective\", held a bleak view of the future, and had little interest in space as a new frontier. Regarding \"heroes\", several novels by H. G. Wells have the protagonist as nameless, and often powerless, in the face of natural forces. The evolutionary perspective can be seen in tales involving long time periods, such as The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine by Wells, or Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon. Even in scientific romances that did not involve vast stretches of time, the issue of whether mankind was just another species subject to evolutionary pressures often arose, as can be seen in parts of The Hampdenshire Wonder by J. D. Beresford and several works by S. Fowler Wright. Regarding space, C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy took the position that \"as long as humanity remains flawed and sinful, our exploration of other planets will tend to do them more harm than good\"; and most scientific romance authors had not even that much interest in the topic. As for bleakness, it can be seen in many of the works by all the authors already cited, who deemed humanity flawed \u2014 either by original sin or, much more often, by biological factors inherited from our ape ancestors. Stableford also notes that some of the British scientific romances were saved from \"being entirely gloomy\" by their philosophical speculation (calling them works of \"modest armchair philosophizing\"). He cites E. V. Odle's The Clockwork Man, John Gloag's Tomorrow's Yesterday and Murray Constantine's Proud Man as examples of this type of scientific romance.Brian Stableford, Creators of Science Fiction", "* Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon", "* Last Men in London by Olaf Stapledon", "* Odd John by Olaf Stapledon", "* Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon"]}, {"page": "List of science fiction novels", "response": ["* Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon", "* Odd John by Olaf Stapledon", "* Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon"]}, {"page": "List of ethicists", "response": ["* Olaf Stapledon"]}, {"page": "SF Masterworks", "response": ["|Olaf Stapledon", "|Olaf Stapledon", "|Olaf Stapledon", "|Olaf Stapledon", "|Olaf Stapledon", "|Olaf Stapledon"]}, {"page": "Star Maker", "response": ["Star Maker is a science fiction novel by British writer Olaf Stapledon, published in 1937.
