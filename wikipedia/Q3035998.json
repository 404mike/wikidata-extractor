His first film was The Gay Lord Quex released in 1917. He starred as the title character in the successful musical The Boy in the same year. He then appeared in more than 60 films between 1916 and 1940, including five films directed by Alfred Hitchcock.\nHe died in Eton, Berkshire from a heart attack while he was filming Major Barbara (1941). According to Ronald Neame in his autobiography, some shots in the final film had a stand-in playing Calthrop's role (from the back) and a piece of dialogue was recorded using an unnamed person who impersonated Calthrop's voice.\nHe was the nephew of dramatist Dion Boucicault.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Trafalgar", "response": ["* Nelson (also cited Nelson: The Story of England's Immortal Naval Hero) is a silent 1918 British historical film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Donald Calthrop, Malvina Longfellow and Ivy Close.\"Nelson; The Story of England's Immortal Naval Hero\", catalogue, British Film Institute (BFI), London, UK.

To cash in on the new popularity of talkies, the film's producer, John Maxwell of British International Pictures, gave Hitchcock the go-ahead to film a portion of the movie in sound. Most sources state that Hitchcock thought the idea absurd and surreptitiously filmed almost the entire feature in sound, but in reality the silent version - which was largely completed - was cleverly used for several sequences with non-synchronous sound and dialogue where the actors faces were not visible. The opening 6\u00bd minutes of the sound version are silent, with musical accompaniment, as are numerous shorter scenes later, and the entire final chase sequence is from the silent version with occasional non-synchronized vocal interjections, including Donald Calthrop's last words on the dome of the British Museum's reading room. Thus it can be argued that the sound version of Blackmail, despite BIP's publicity, is a \"part-talkie\". (By contrast, Gaumont-British's High Treason, directed by Maurice Elvey and released in September 1929, was made in all-sound and silent versions simultaneously, with the sound version being truly \"all-talkie\".)"]}, {"page": "Number Seventeen", "response": ["* Donald Calthrop as Brant \u2013 Nora's Escort"]}, {"page": "Murder!", "response": ["* Donald Calthrop as Ion Stewart"]}, {"page": "The Clairvoyant (1935 film)", "response": ["* Donald Calthrop as Derelict  "]}, {"page": "Major Barbara (film)", "response": ["*Donald Calthrop as Peter Shirley"]}, {"page": "Calthrop", "response": ["* Donald Calthrop (1888\u20131940), English film actor "]}, {"page": "Fire Over England", "response": ["* Donald Calthrop as Don Escobal"]}, {"page": "Elstree Calling", "response": ["* Donald Calthrop"]}, {"page": "Seymour Hicks", "response": ["Hicks's most famous role was that of Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol.
