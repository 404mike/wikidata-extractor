Professors Russell Foster and Colin Espie with their project \"Teensleep\" will assess whether ten half-hour lessons in year 10 will improve academic performance and well-being. Taught by specially trained teachers, the lessons introduce scientific theory on the importance of sleep and the effects of sleep deprivation as well as techniques for stress management.  The study has been redesigned since it was originally announced; it was previously considerably more ambitious, including a later start time at about twenty-five schools, sleep education in others, both in some schools and neither in others. Students will be evaluated before and after the sleep education periods."]}, {"page": "Sleepio", "response": ["Sleepio is a digital sleep-improvement program featuring cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques developed by sleep scientist Colin Espie and ex-insomnia sufferer Peter Hames.", "Sleepio is the first program from Big Health, the behavioural medicine company co-founded by Professor Colin Espie and Peter Hames.Steve O'Hear, \u201cBig Health, the startup behind Sleepio, raises $12M to scale delivery of non-drug mental health solutions\u201d, Techcrunch, July 2016."]}, {"page": "Professor Colin Espie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Espie"]}, {"page": "Titles of distinction awarded by the University of Oxford", "response": ["* Colin Espie, Professor of Sleep Medicines"]}, {"page": "Espie", "response": ["*Colin Espie (born 1957), Scottish neuroscientist"]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Colin Espie FRSM FBPsS (1957), Scottish neuroscientist and Professor of Sleep Medicine "]}]}}
