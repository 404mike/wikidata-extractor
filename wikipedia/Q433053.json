They had preferred to make stars rather than hire them, and engaging the legendary Gertrude Lawrence would be expensive.  Lawrence's voice was also a worry: her limited vocal range was diminishing with the years, while her tendency to sing flat was increasing.  Lawrence's temperament was another concern: though she could not sing like one, the star was known to be capable of diva-like behavior.Nolan, pp. 310\u201311  In spite of this, they admired her acting \u2013 what Hammerstein called her \"magic light\",  a compelling presence on stage \u2013 and agreed to write the show.Fordin, p. 291  For her part, Lawrence committed to remaining in the show until June 1, 1953, and waived the star's usual veto rights over cast and director, leaving control in the hands of the two authors.
