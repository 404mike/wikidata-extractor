The backbench Conservative MP Leo Amery said Chamberlain's speech left the House in a restive and depressed, though not yet mutinous, state of mind. Amery believed that Chamberlain was \"obviously satisfied with things as they stood\" and, in the government camp, the mood was actually positive as they believed they were, in John Colville's words, \"going to get away with it\"."]}, {"page": "Henry Morris", "response": ["*Henry Morris-Jones (1884\u20131972), Welsh doctor, soldier and politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Henry Morris-Jones"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Henry Morris-Jones "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Henry Morris-Jones"]}, {"page": "1972 in Wales", "response": ["*9 July \u2013 Sir Henry Morris-Jones, doctor, soldier and politician, 87"]}, {"page": "List of National Liberal Party (UK, 1931) MPs", "response": ["| (John) Henry Morris-Jones || Denbigh || 1931, 1943 || 1942, 1950"]}, {"page": "Denbigh (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"| Sir Henry Morris-Jones", "*Liberal National: Henry Morris-Jones"]}, {"page": "Garner Evans", "response": ["The sitting National Liberal Member of Parliament for Denbigh, Sir Henry Morris-Jones, announced his retirement.
