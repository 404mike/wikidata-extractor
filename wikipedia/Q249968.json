In his career, the handsome Englishman made more than 180 appearances in film and on television. He was erroneously credited in later years as Les Matthews. Matthews played supporting roles in films like The Raven and Werewolf of London (both 1935), but his career deteriorated into bit parts. He died on 5 June 1975, the day before his 75th birthday, in Los Angeles. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fu Manchu", "response": ["* Lester Matthews in The Adventures of Dr Fu Manchu (1956)", "The television arm of Republic Pictures produced a 13-episode syndicated series, The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu (1956), starring Glen Gordon as Dr. Fu Manchu, Lester Matthews as Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and Clark Howat as Dr. John Petrie. The title sequence depicted Smith and Dr. Fu Manchu in a game of chess as the announcer stated that \"the devil is said to play for men's souls. So does Dr. Fu Manchu, evil incarnate.\" At the conclusion of each episode, after Nayland Smith and Petrie had foiled Dr. Fu Manchu's latest fiendish scheme, Dr. Fu Manchu would be seen breaking a black chess piece in a fit of frustration (black king's bishop, always the same scene, repeated) just before the closing credits rolled. It was directed by Franklin Adreon, as well as William Witney. Dr. Fu Manchu was never allowed to succeed in this TV series. Unlike the Holmes/Watson type relationship of the films, the series featured Smith as a law enforcement officer and Petrie as a staff member for the Surgeon-General."]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Robin Hood", "response": ["* Lester Matthews as Sir Ivor, a supporter of Prince John"]}, {"page": "The Pied Piper (1942 film)", "response": ["*Lester Matthews as Mr. Cavanaugh"]}, {"page": "List of fictional doctors", "response": ["|The Raven || Dr. Richard VallonDr. Jerry Holden || B\u00e9la LugosiLester Matthews "]}, {"page": "If I Were King", "response": ["* Lester Matthews as General Saliere"]}, {"page": "Northwest Passage (film)", "response": ["At the local tavern with friend Sam Livermore (Lester Matthews), Langdon disparages Wiseman Clagett (Montagu Love), the king's attorney, and the Indian agent Sir William Johnson, unaware that Clagett is in the next room with another official.
