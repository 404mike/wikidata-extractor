His first game on 17 November resulted in a 2\u20130 defeat by Watford. It was Moyes' 500th game as a manager, the result leaving West Ham in 18th place and a relegation position.Deciding on a change of formation, Moyes played a three-man defence allowing striker, Marko Arnautovi\u0107 to concentrate on his role as a goal scorer. By April 2018 he was one of the in-form players in the Premier League scoring nine goals in 14 games. A 3\u20131 win against Everton on the last day of the season, moved West Ham up to 13th place. After six months in charge and having secured a Premier League place for the following season, Moyes left. He had recorded nine wins and 10 draws from 31 games as West Ham manager.His only significant purchases for the club being the transfers of Jordan Hugill and Patrice Evra The season had been marred with crowd protests and pitch invasions aimed at the board of directors and as a rejection of West Ham's move to the Olympic Stadium. This culminated on 10 March 2018 during a 3\u20130 home defeat by Burnley when fans invaded the pitch four times, protested against the board such that owner, David Sullivan was escorted from his seat and unfurled a banner saying \"$old a dream given a nightmare\"."]}, {"page": "List of Preston North End F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Jordan Hugill"]}, {"page": "Glenn Hoddle Academy", "response": ["*Jordan Hugill \u2013 signed by Port Vale, now at West Ham United."]}, {"page": "List of Port Vale F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["Jordan Hugill scored five goals in 24 games for the club before being signed by Preston North End in June 2014, though a 20% sell on clause would net the club a \u00a31.8 million windfall when Preston sold him on to West Ham United in January 2018. Strikers Tony Sealy and Alex Jones both scored ten goals in successful loan spells the Vale, helping the players to prove their talent to their parent clubs. David Healy only scored three goals during his loan spell, but would go on to become Northern Ireland's record scorer.

This proved to be the last match for \"Cumbrians\" boss Greg Abbott, who was sacked two days later. Vale then were beaten 3\u20132 by Leyton Orient, who recorded their sixth successive league victory. Despite the result, fans were pleased with the team's performance against the league leaders. Another tough match followed with Coventry City, and supporters were treated to an entertaining game that saw the Valiants twice come from behind to record a 3\u20132 victory. Immediately following the game Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery. His first game in charge was a 1\u20130 victory at Tranmere Rovers, with Chris Lines' well taken free-kick being enough to win the three points. Page also took charge of the 1\u20131 home draw with Bristol City, and admitted the players performed well below their best. Adams returned on crutches for the home encounter with high-flying Peterborough United and tried a new diamond formation in midfield; the tactic brought a good performance out of the side, but a late strike for \"Posh\" left Vale with a 1\u20130 defeat. The next game was against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, and Adams was again disappointed at his boyhood club as Vale were beaten 2\u20131, with Daniel Jones sent off for two yellow cards after just 20 minutes. After the match Adams showed concern over the lack of club discipline on display as Myrie-Williams publicly argued with Adams after being substituted and Pope and Robertson had a heated discussion on the pitch. He had no complaints though when Vale came back from Crawley Town with a 3\u20130 victory; Jordan Hugill, fresh from a loan spell with Gateshead, made an impressive debut up front with Ben Williamson. The same eleven players started the following game at home to Gillingham, and came from 1\u20130 down at half-time to win 2\u20131 after the introduction of Tom Pope.", "April began with a 2\u20131 win over Crawley, the only negative in the game being a red card for Chris Robertson, who seemed baffled as to why he was dismissed. His ban was later overturned and handed to Chris Lines, who had committed the tackle from behind which started the brawl in which Robertson had attempted to intervene as peacemaker. Vale went on to beat Walsall 1\u20130 with a controversial penalty and in doing so recorded their first double over Walsall in 114 years. Captain Loft and Dan Jones were ruled out of the Vale's next fixture after a training ground confrontation between the pair left Loft with a facial injury. Following a short investigation Jones was sacked by the club. This upheaval seemed not to affect the team as they went 2\u20130 up over Notts County at Meadow Lane, but then four goals without reply from County all but ended Vale's faint hopes of a play-off push. Vale then recorded their fourth straight home win after Jordan Hugill scored the only goal of the game against Milton Keynes Dons. A trip to third-place Rotherham ended with a 1\u20130 defeat, despite the hosts going down to ten men. In their final home game of the season, Vale let slip a one-goal lead to lose 2\u20131 to Sheffield United. The season ended with a 0\u20130 draw with Peterborough United at London Road. Three players were released in the summer: Anthony Griffith, Liam Chilvers and Rob Taylor, whilst Chris Shuker announced his retirement due to a chronic knee injury. Micky Adams elected to sign a new contract with the club, as did most of the club's out-of-contract players. However a big blow to the club was the departure of Doug Loft, who joined hometown club Gillingham. Another big name to leave the club was Jennison Myrie-Williams, who signed with Scunthorpe United. Promising forward Jordan Hugill also rejected a contract, and instead signed with Preston North End. Meanwhile, Gavin Tomlin was sold to Crawley Town for a small fee, after deciding to relocate back to London after failing to settle in the Midlands. The final departure was young defender Joe Davis, who left to join the Leicester City Academy.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||39||align=\"left\"| Jordan Hugill", "|7||FW||||39||Jordan Hugill||4||1||0||0||5", "|39||||FW||Jordan Hugill||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0", "|align=\"center\"| Young Player of the Year ||align=\"center\"| Jordan Hugill", "|||Jordan Hugill", "|||Jordan Hugill"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["In his second summer in charge Simon Grayson signed 5 players permanently \u2013 Jamie Jones, Calum Woods, Jordan Hugill, Andy Little and Kyel Reid and brought Paul Gallagher in on a season long loan.
