He won the Cheshire County League title with Buxton in 1972\u201373.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dennis Butler", "response": ["Following his retirement as a player, he coached at Rochdale and Bury. He was made assistant manager at Port Vale under Bobby Smith in November 1977. After Smith's departure to Swindon Town, he became manager for the 1978\u201379 season. The \"Valiants\" finished 16th in the Fourth Division and later he left by mutual consent in August 1979. He had signed popular player Bernie Wright from Bradford City for \u00a39,000, however most of his big money signings had torrid times at Vale Park. He signed right-back Neil Wilkinson (free), Ken Todd (a club-record \u00a337,000 signing despite only having made a handful of appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers), Gerry Keenan (\u00a315,000), Felix Healy (\u00a38,000), Kevin Tully (\u00a33,000 plus Neil Wilkinson), Andy Proudlove (\u00a31,000), Peter Farrell (breaking the club-record again at \u00a340,000), and Bob Delgado (\u00a330,000). To finance these signings, he sold John Froggatt (\u00a38,000), Mick Moore (\u00a32,000), Terry Bailey (\u00a32,000), Ken Beamish (\u00a335,000), and John Ridley (\u00a355,000). After his team were booed he called the fans 'a bunch of yobs'. Vale recorded a \u00a352,000 loss despite a remarkable \u00a3225,000 income from the club's commercial department. Butler's transfer dealings had lost the club \u00a336,000, whilst wages more than doubled from \u00a3113,000 to \u00a3259,000. After leaving Burslem, Butler then reunited with Bobby Smith at Swindon, becoming the first team coach before retiring from football in 1980."]}, {"page": "Andrew George Proudlove", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Proudlove"]}, {"page": "Andrew Proudlove", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Proudlove"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with just two victories in eleven league games, as both Todd and keeper John Connaughton were sidelined with injuries. The two wins came away from home, 5\u20131 over rivals Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road (Wright scoring a hat-trick) and 3\u20131 at Doncaster Rovers at the Keepmoat Stadium. Butler then threw himself into the transfer market, selling John Froggatt to Northampton Town for \u00a38,000, and then Mick Moore and Terry Bailey to Wigan Athletic and Northwich Victoria respectively, both for \u00a32,000. Another 'shrewd piece of business' came when star forward Ken Beamish was sold to Bury for \u00a335,000, whilst Gerry Keenan moved the other way for \u00a315,000. In October, Felix Healy was signed from Finn Harps for \u00a38,000, and Neil Wilkinson and \u00a33,000 were traded to Crewe in exchange for outside-right Kevin Tully. Winning five games in a sequence of eight, Todd was still a disappointment to fans, who began getting 'on his back'. Butler's signings did not stop however, and instead he sold John Ridley to Leicester City for a club-record \u00a355,000. He then signed Andy Proudlove from Buxton for \u00a31,000 \u2013 despite interest from Stafford Rangers. Then in came midfielder Peter Farrell from Bury for a new club-record \u00a340,000.

Butler's transfer dealings had lost the club \u00a336,000, whilst wages more than doubled from \u00a3113,000 to \u00a3259,000. The club's liabilities stood at \u00a3187,000. Despite all of this the club made 'surprisingly sparing use of the pruning knife', letting go just four players, most significantly David Harris (Halifax Town) and Andy Proudlove (Stafford Rangers). Behind the scenes, long-time club servant and president Mark Singer was fired, though chairman Arthur McPherson made no comment to the press.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Andy Proudlove", "| November 1978 || MF ||  || Andy Proudlove || Buxton || \u00a31,000 || ", "| May 1979 || MF ||  || Andy Proudlove || Stafford Rangers || Free transfer || "]}]}}
