He referred to himself as \"of semi-Quaker descent.\"Turner was the first person to be ordered deported from the United States for violation of the 1903 Anarchist Exclusion Act. Turner was a member of the Socialist League, but left to become a member of the Freedom Group (UK), and later on became general secretary of the Shop Assistants' Union that he founded. At one point, the union attempted to nominate Turner for Parliament, but he declined, preferring not to \"waste his time in parliamentary debates\". Turner worked on several publications in addition to Freedom. He was a member of the collective putting out Commonweal, and also the editor of Freedom's syndicalist journal The Voice of Labour, which denounced the \"blight of respectability\" of mainstream labour unions. The paper began as a weekly in 1907, and advocated direct action and the general strike.The same year, Turner, along with Guy Aldred and others, formed the Industrial Union of Direct Action. Turner was also elected (in absentia) to the International Bureau of the Anarchist International, formed at the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam. Throughout the many changes in Freedom's history, Turner was its publisher from the time it was renamed Freedom: A Journal of Libertarian Thought, Work and Literature in 1930 until his death in 1934.After the Russian Revolution, Turner traveled to Russia as part of the British Labour Delegation, and attempted to help Aron Baron acquire reprieve from a death sentence. Baron was subsequently charged with having \"aroused public sentiment abroad against his imprisonment in the Solovietzki and having induced revolutionists visiting Russia to seek his release.\" Baron was then sent to a prison in Siberia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Emma Goldman", "response": ["After an English anarchist named John Turner was arrested under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and threatened with deportation, Goldman joined forces with the Free Speech League to champion his cause.Falk, Making Speech Free, p. 557.

Syndicalism was one of the main points of discussion. The French anarchist Pierre Monatte was the primary advocate of syndicalism, while the Italian Errico Malatesta criticized it. The congress helped form links between syndicalists in various countries and spread the movement.Dam'e 2006, p. 42, Thorpe 1989, pp. 30\u201331 The congress decided to form an International Bureau which also became known as the Anarchist International. Schapiro, Rocker, and Malatesta were chosen as the bureau's secretaries.Kloosterman 1979, p. 276, Rodenburg 2014, p. 243, Thorpe 1989, p. 89, Woodcock & Avakumovi\u0107 1950, p. 385. Schapiro became the editor of the Bureau's journal, the Bulletin de l'Internationale  Anarchiste, which he published in French from London until 1910. The Bulletin disseminated information about anarchist and syndicalist movements between countries. For about a year, it appeared almost every month, but then died off slowly.Bantman 2006, p. 968, Bantman 2013, p. 159, Rodenburg 2014, p. 243 Schapiro wrote that the lack of enthusiasm of the international anarchist movement for the Anarchist International and the Bulletin was due to \"the fear that organisation might be the way whereby centralisation and authoritarianism could sneak into the anarchist movement\".Bantman 2006, p. 968. Rocker praised the patience, intelligence, and talent Schapiro exhibited in his work for the Anarchist International. In 1909, Schapiro, Rocker, Malatesta, and John Turner repeatedly called for a follow-up congress, but their calls received no replies. A second congress was finally planned to take place in London in August 1914. Schapiro was heavily involved in the preparations and published a bulletin to facilitate communication in the run-up to the congress. It focused on anti-militarism, syndicalism, and organizational questions. Anarchists from several countries pledged to attend and Schapiro was optimistic the congress would be a success. However, after World War I broke out, it had to be canceled.Avrich 1967, pp. 115\u2013116, Bantman 2013, p. 159\u2013160, Kloosterman 1979, p. 276, Thorpe 1989, p. 89.
