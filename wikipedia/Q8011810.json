He was best known for his published engravings which included caricatures, political cartoons, and commentary on contemporary life.Heath was born in Northumberland. His early works often dealt with military scenes, including colour plates for The Martial Achievements, The Wars of Wellington, etc., but from about 1820 on he focused on satire. Between 1827 and 1829, many of his works were published under the pseudonym \"Paul Pry\" (the name of an overly inquisitive stage character in a popular 1825 stage comedy by John Poole ); also used the pseudonym Argus. He was described by Dr John Brown, biographer of John Leech as \"poor Heath, the ex-Captain of Dragoons, facile and profuse, unscrupulous and clever\".Heath helped found an early caricature magazines, The Glasgow Looking Glass (renamed to The Northern Looking Glass after five issues).\nHeath created a numbered series of political Caricatures between 1830 and 1834 for McLean's Monthly. He died in Hampstead, London.\nThe British Museum catalogue has over 160 works by Heath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1840 in art", "response": ["* April 7 \u2013 William Heath, English satirical engraver (born 1794)"]}, {"page": "1794 in art", "response": ["** William Heath, English satirical engraver (died 1840)"]}, {"page": "Paul Pry", "response": ["* Paul Pry, pseudonym of artist William Heath"]}, {"page": "1840 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 7 April \u2013 William Heath, caricaturist (born 1794)"]}, {"page": "1794 in Great Britain", "response": ["* Approximate date \u2013 William Heath, caricaturist (died 1840)"]}, {"page": "Before 1900s in comics", "response": ["* June 11: First publication of The Glasgow Looking Glass (1825-1826), a British magazine that goes down in history as the first publication devoted entirely to comics and cartoons.

The approximate date of birth and baby's mother's name correlate with C.J. Grant's entry in the 1841 census, which lists him as a 37 year-old engraver living with a 66 year-old woman named Sarah Grant. If Grant spent his formative years in south London then this perhaps explains how he managed to establish an early connection with the Lambeth-based caricaturist William Heath. The discovery of Grant's personal guard book of prints in the 1990s revealed that he produced a number of caricatures for Heath which the latter then published and passed off as his own work. The exact nature of the relationship between the two artists is difficult to determine but it seems likely that it came to an end by the spring of 1831, as by that time Grant had begun openly pirating copies of Heath's work for other publishers.

Dorothy George, Hogarth to Cruikshank (London 1967) p. 177 The March of Intellect was repeatedly satirised in written print and visual media, such as cartoons. Cartoons were frequently used in the nineteenth century to explore current affairs and were becoming increasingly accessible during the peak of the March of Intellect. William Heath\u2019s collection of prints published between 1825 and 1829 have become central representations of the debate. Heath used machines, steam-powered vehicles and other forms of technology in his work to mock liberal Whiggish ambitions that problems in society could be solved through widespread education. The scenes present futuristic visions of society whereby issues such as travel, emigration and postal delivery had been conquered by technological innovation through knowledge. They represent some of the advances in everyday life such as faster travel due to the extension of the railway and the rise in exchanging letters. These and other satirical works from the period recognised that a transformation within society was already in motion, but were ambiguous as to whether reform would be progressive or damaging. For example, Robert Seymour's cartoon entitled 'The March of Intellect' (c.1828) in which a giant automaton sweeps away quacks, delayed parliamentary bills and court cases, can be seen as apocalyptic in its attempt to improve society. The March of Intellect remained ambivalent throughout satire, but recurrently criticised the ambition of educating the working class. In Peacock's 1831 novel Crotchet Castle, one character, Dr. Folliott, satirised the \"Steam Intellect Society\" and linked the march explicitly to folly, rural protest and the rise in crime: \"the march of mind...marched in through my back-parlour shutters, and out again with my silver spoons\".Thomas Love Peacock, Nightmare Abbey and Crotchet Castle (London 1947) p. 212-3, and p. 105-6, p. 219 Peacock had earlier parodied the Utilitarian take on the role of the modern poet:M. H Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp (Oxford 1953) p. 126 \"The march of his intellect is like that of a crab, backward\"Quoted in Ben Wilson, Decency and Disorder (London 2007) p. 317"]}]}}
