During the summer break, Ainsworth rebuilt his squad, with the addition of Paul Hayes for a second spell at the club. The 2014\u201315 season saw the club spend the majority of the season in the automatic promotion places. However, two costly home defeats to Morecambe and local rivals Oxford United led to a finishing position of 4th, setting up a play-off fixture against Plymouth Argyle. The play-off final took place on 23 May and within five seconds of kick-off Wycombe midfielder Sam Saunders pulled his calf muscle and had to be substituted for Matt Bloomfield in the fourth minute. During the regular 90 minutes both teams had a goal disallowed, but neither managed to score. Four minutes into extra time Wycombe were awarded a free kick just outside the Southend penalty area. Joe Jacobson took the free kick and the ball rebounded off keeper Daniel Bentley and into the net. Southend continued to put pressure on Wycombe until Joe Pigott scored in the 122nd minute to tie the game at 1\u20131 and send it to a penalty shoot out. Southend won the shoot out 7\u20136 when Sam Wood's effort was saved by Bentley."]}, {"page": "Samuel Wood", "response": ["Samuel or Sam Wood may refer to:", "*Sam Wood (1884\u20131949), American film director", "*Sam Wood (artist), game artist", "*Sam Wood (rugby league, born 1994), English rugby league player", "*Sam Wood (rugby league, born 1997), English rugby league player", "*Sam Wood (archaeologist), archaeologist and TV presenter", "*Sam Wood (cricketer) (born 1993), English cricketer", "*Sam Wood (footballer) (born 1986), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Barry Fuller", "response": ["Fuller made his debut for Gillingham in the 2\u20130 defeat to Tranmere Rovers on 29 January 2008. The defender would go on to make nine more appearances for the Gills in the 2007\u201308 season. On 10 October 2008, despite having only been with the Gills for nine months, the 24-year-old was appointed as club captain. He made forty league appearances in total during the 2008\u201309 season, making him integral to the club's push for promotion. In spite of this level of consistency, however, his season was wrought with difficulty. The defender's troubles began when he was sent off for a second yellow card offence after a foul on Sam Wood in the 88th minute of a 1\u20131 draw with Brentford on 20 December 2008, resulting in a one match ban. His troubles did not end there however, as in January 2009 he was rushed to hospital after contracting bacterial pneumonia. He made a rapid recovery, however, and returned just five weeks later to play a full match in a 2\u20130 defeat by Rotherham United at Millmoor on 14 February 2009. Despite these set-backs, he was able to help Gillingham finish the season in 5th place, making them eligible for the League Two play-offs. Gillingham faced Rochdale in the play-off semi-final, drawing 0\u20130 in the first leg on 7 May 2009, before securing a place in the play-off final by beating Rochdale 2\u20131 at the Priestfield Stadium in the second leg on 10 May 2009. Gillingham faced Shrewsbury Town in the 2009 League Two play-off final at Wembley Stadium on 23 May 2009, in which Fuller captained his side to a 1\u20130 win over \"The Shrews\" in front of a crowd of 53,706 to seal promotion to League One, a dramatic turn of events considering that he had been suffering with a life-threatening illness just five months before. thumb|240px|Fuller holding the League Two Play-off Winners trophy after captaining Gillingham to a 1\u20130 victory over Shrewsbury Town at Wembley Stadium on 23 May 2009"]}, {"page": "Glenn Poole", "response": ["His second season at Brentford was less successful, as he lost his place in the team to Sam Wood from December 2008.
