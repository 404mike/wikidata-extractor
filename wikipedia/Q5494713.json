He was born in West Bromwich and attended Christ Church School, before working at the local George Salter's Spring Works. He played for West Bromwich Albion from September 1879 and scored in the 1883 Staffordshire Senior Cup Final as Albion won their first ever trophy. In 1885, Bunn became one of the club's first professionals when the FA legalised payments to players. He left the club the following year to join Crosswell's Brewery, after disagreements with some of the Albion committee members. He finished his career at Oldbury Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1882\u201383 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season", "response": ["In the final, Albion faced Stoke at the latter's Victoria Ground. More than 1,500 West Bromwich Albion supporters took advantage of a special rail excursion to attend the game. Johnson opened the scoring for Stoke after 15 minutes, but Albion replied through Timmins and Fred Bunn. Stoke equalised before half-time when Johnson claimed his second goal of the match. George Bell scored the winning goal in the second half when he headed a cross past Stoke's goalkeeper Wildin. Albion's 3\u20132 victory meant that they had won their first ever trophy.Matthews (1987) p. 10."]}]}}
