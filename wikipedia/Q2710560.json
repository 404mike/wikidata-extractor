The core themes of his work are supercritical fluids, infrared spectroscopy and lasers. He is a research professor in chemistry at the University of Nottingham. His group comprises several members of staff, postdoctoral research fellows, postgraduate students and overseas visitors.  As well as carrying out research at the University of Nottingham, he is a lecturer, teaching a number of modules including green chemistry.Poliakoff became popularly known in the late 2000s and early 2010s as the main figure of the YouTube channel Periodic Videos.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 16", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Martyn Poliakoff, English chemist and academic"]}, {"page": "FIFA World Cup Trophy", "response": ["A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries. Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands  tall and is made of  of 18 carat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$161,000 in 2018, with a base  in diameter containing two layers of malachite. It has been asserted by Sir Martyn Poliakoff of Periodic Videos that the trophy is hollow; if, as is claimed, it were solid, the trophy would weigh  and would be too heavy to lift. Produced by Bertoni, Milano in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, \"The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory\"."]}, {"page": "Westminster School", "response": ["*Martyn Poliakoff (born 1947) Professor of Chemistry and narrator of The Periodic Table of Videos"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Westminster School", "response": ["*Martyn Poliakoff (born 1947), scientist"]}, {"page": "Popular science", "response": ["* The Periodic Table of Videos \u2013 a series of YouTube videos featuring chemistry professor Martyn Poliakoff"]}, {"page": "Stephen Poliakoff", "response": ["His brother, Sir Martyn Poliakoff, a research chemist and lecturer, is a Fellow of the Royal Society, being, until November 2016, its Foreign Secretary and vice-president.
