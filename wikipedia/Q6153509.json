She had a fine alto voice, which developed into a contralto, and she studied singing under John Wass, Ciro Pinsuti and Emma Lucombe (wife of Sims Reeves). Whytock's first appearance, in 1860, was made at Birmingham under the name Ellen Andrews.Her first regular engagement was in 1865, in the provinces. From 1866, in which year she sang at the Worcester Festival, and married John Patey, a bass singer, she was recognized as one of the leading contraltos; and on the retirement of Helen Sainton-Dolby in 1870 Patey was without a rival whether in oratorio or in ballad music. She toured in America in 1871, sang in Paris in 1875, Australia in 1890, and New Zealand in 1891.\nShe died at Sheffield on 28 February 1894 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Her daughter was Ethel Patey, the artist, who under her married name, Ethel Jackson, gave a portrait of her mother to the Tate Gallery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Patey", "response": ["*Janet Monach Patey (1842\u20131894), English contralto"]}, {"page": "The Golden Legend (cantata)", "response": ["*Ursula, contralto \u2013 Janet Monach Patey"]}, {"page": "The Martyr of Antioch", "response": ["*Julia, a worshipper of the Sun (contralto) \u2013 Janet Monach Patey"]}, {"page": "Helen Lemmens-Sherrington", "response": ["Lemmens-Sherrington's stage debut was in 1860, in the first production of a new opera, Robin Hood, by George Alexander Macfarren (libretto by John Oxenford).\"Her Majesty's Theatre\", The Times, 15 October 1860, p. 12 This was chosen by Edward Tyrrel Smith as the vehicle for an attempt to launch an English Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre, the English season to run concurrently with an Italian season on alternate nights. The singers engaged were Lemmens-Sherrington (Maid Marian), Mme Lemaire, Charles Santley, Mr Parkinson and John Sims Reeves (Locksley). The orchestra was conducted on English nights by Charles Hall\u00e9. The duet with Reeves, \"When lovers are parted\" and Marian's song \"True love, true love in my heart\" (the theme of which ran through the whole score) were \"exquisitely warbled\" and received enthusiastic applause. It was so successful that Reeves and Sherrington got a better box office even than Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Tietjens and Antonio Giuglini on the alternate nights in Il trovatore and Don Giovanni.J.
