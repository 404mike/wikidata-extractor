He scored six goals on his debut in Newcastle's 13\u20130 defeat of Newport County at St James' Park on 5 October, with three of his goals coming within the space of just 155 seconds.The Times, 7 October 1946, Association Football Newcastle's 13 Goals However his return to Park Avenue in his fourth game for Newcastle was not a happy one, as he had a penalty saved by former teammate Chick Farr in a 2\u20131 defeat to Bradford PA. The \"Magpies\" boasted a devastating forward line of Jackie Milburn, Roy Bentley, Charlie Wayman, Shackleton, and Tommy Pearson, and totalled 95 league goals in the 1946\u201347 season, though their tally of 62 goals conceded and 13 defeats left the club having to settle for fifth place. They did though reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten 4\u20130 by Charlton Athletic. After the semi-final game he and club captain Joe Harvey went on strike over housing issues; the club's board eventually relented and granted Shackleton the house they had initially promised him, though to save face told the press that Harvey and Shackleton had been in the wrong and had apologised. He further came into conflict with the club at Christmas 1947, when he and goalkeeper Jack Fairbrother refused to join the squad on a scouting party on opponents Charlton Athletic, who they faced later that season in the third round of the FA Cup. Unhappy with the club, he handed in a transfer request, which was granted."]}, {"page": "Ronnie Simpson", "response": ["After completing his National Service, Simpson moved to Third Lanark in 1950.

The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years. He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the 1963\u201364 season, and at the end of the campaign manager Jack Fairbrother was replaced by Gordon Clark, who Dougan said \"renewed my sense of vocation\".
