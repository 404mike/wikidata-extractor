I should have blamed the director, who had obviously told her to bounce up and down at all times in order to convey exuberance. [...] In that same production, Alan Dobie as Andrei was grim enough to send you to sleep, but Anthony Hopkins was a perfect Pierre: a real tribute to his acting, because his default mode is to be in command.\"", "Paul Mavis (DVD Talk) awarded it 4 stars, saying \"it positively luxuriates in its expansive format, giving the viewer a remarkable chance to fully experience the various nuances of character and the myriad permutations of shifting relationships (as well as Tolstoy's numerous plot coincidences) that mark this mammoth work.\" He praised Alan Dobie as \"uniformed in Byronic splendor [...] spot-on as the dour, heroic, closed-off Andrei Bolkonsky.\", also praising Angela Down (Maria) and Sylvester Morand (Nikolai). However, he criticised Hood's performance, saying \"the casting of Morag Hood (which, according to the production history included in this DVD set, was a desperate, last-minute decision) is a distressing misfire. [...] poor Hood can't begin to approach the character with even a modicum of believability. Natasha begins the story as a wild, impetuous girl of thirteen - an age and a temperament that Hood evidently felt needed to be delineated by having Natasha laugh insanely at everything while leaping about like a mad thing (Hood is also far too old to be a believable 13-year-old). As for later maturing into this bewitching, erotic little beauty whom all men adore, either an actress has that innate, inexplicable quality or they don't - you can't \"act\" that powerful allure onto the screen. It has to come from within, and simply put, Hood doesn't have it.\""]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac episodes", "response": ["| Lee Montague, Morag Hood, Rowena Cooper, Geoffrey Bateman, Davyd Harries, Christian Rodska"]}, {"page": "Story Teller (magazine)", "response": ["* Pandora's Box: Morag Hood", "* A Fishy Tale: Morag Hood", "* Traveller Ned : Morag Hood", "* Larkspur Gets Her Wings : Morag Hood"]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Morag Hood, actress (born 1942)"]}, {"page": "1942 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 12 December \u2013 Morag Hood, Scottish actress (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "Edwin Sherin", "response": ["In 1974, Sherin directed a revival of A Streetcar Named Desire at London's Theatre with Claire Bloom, Martin Shaw, Joss Ackland, and Morag Hood.Kolin, Philip C.\"London, 1974\" Williams: A streetcar named desire, Cambridge University Press, 2000, , p. 97"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish actors", "response": ["*Morag Hood (1942\u20132002)"]}, {"page": "Wuthering Heights (1970 film)", "response": ["* Morag Hood as Frances Earnshaw"]}, {"page": "Bellahouston Academy", "response": ["*Morag Hood - Actress"]}, {"page": "Persuasion (1971 TV series)", "response": ["* Morag Hood as Mary Musgrove"]}, {"page": "Hood (surname)", "response": ["* Morag Hood (1942\u20132002), Scottish actress"]}, {"page": "Julia Lockwood", "response": ["|Tommy Steel, Michele Dotrice, Clive Francis, Edward de Souza, Morag Hood, Graham Crowden"]}, {"page": "Ned Chaillet", "response": ["| Steve Hodson, Richard Griffiths, Melinda Walker, Denis Lawson, Tim Reynolds, Morag Hood, Steven Harrold, Julie Berry and John Holmstrom", "| Paul Scofield, Morag Hood, Edna Dor\u00e9 and Michael N.
