This was his fourth attempt to visit Petra. Five years earlier the tribe had \"harassed\" and tried to stop them. This time their guide Abu Seyne could not continue due to a blood feud. Hill describes travelling in beautiful spring weather through country green with young corn. At Wadi Waleh they found a \"sweet little stream amongst the oleanders\" from which their cook caught fish by throwing something into the water which \"made them insensible for a brief period\". One day's travel from Madeba brought them to Dhiban where there was a military camp. Here the Sheikh of the Hameideh, \"who had troubled us in 1890\", offered to show an inscription \"up a winding valley\". After walking \"a long way in the hot sun\" Hill was shown a flat stone \"on which three or four Greek (?) letters appeared\". The following night while camped halfway on their journey to Kerak their tents were fired on by members of the Mujelli tribe. About twenty shots were fired but no-one was hurt. Hill speculates that the attack was to deter them from making claims against the Mujelli for compensation for \"their robbery and detention of us in 1890\".Palestine Exploration Fund Magazine (1896).
