His research focuses on integrating declarative interpretable logic-based systems with neural networks, and on formal models of Kant's Critique of Pure ReasonPreviously, he designed the AI for a number of computer games. He was the co-founder, along with Emily Short, of Little Text People, developing real-time multiplayer interactive fiction. Little Text People was acquired by Linden Lab in January 2012 for an undisclosed sum. At EA/Maxis, he was the AI lead on The Sims 3.\nHe designed and implemented the AI for Black & White, for which he received a number of awards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Black & White (video game)", "response": ["In January 1999, Richard Evans was working out how the game judges the morality of the player's behaviour. Mark Webley (who had programmed the creature's artificial intelligence on a testbed version) had become project manager, ensuring routines were listed on task schedules. He stated that this was \"a hundred times more difficult\" than similar tasks at Bullfrog Productions. By March, the team had expanded to 17 people including five artists, five game programmers, two engine programmers, and a sound programmer. Lionhead wanted a maximum of 25 people so as not to break the \"team spirit\" atmosphere. Black & White was shown at E3 1999 where it was judged the most original game.Final Hours, p. 15. At this time, Lionhead were considering 15 cover designs provided by Electronic Arts.", "Programmer Oliver Purkiss was hired to program the villagers. He and Molyneux \"worked tirelessly\" to give the villagers autonomy and individuality without using too much processor power. Purkiss said that they did not want players to believe that villagers were worthless. Afterwards, it was decided that the villagers should have different belief levels, so the player would need to impress more sceptical ones.The Making of Black & White, p. 70. Richard Evans worked on the villagers' reactivity.The Making of Black & White, p. 72.", "The planned level of artificial intelligence for the creature was thought to be risky: Molyneux commented that they wanted to \"advance the technology to its extreme\", and artificial intelligence specialist Richard Evans built the technology, which according to Molyneux appeared to \"live and learn like, say, a clever puppy\". Molyneux desired the creature to pass the Turing test, which had not yet been achieved.", "| Richard Evans"]}, {"page": "Emily Short", "response": ["In June 2011, Emily Short, with Richard Evans, co-founded Little TextPeople, which explored the emotional possibilities of interactive fiction.
