Bassett attended Methodist meetings and associations and was a trustee of a Methodist chapel in Glamorgan, but managed to retain his position in the Church of England until his death in Colwinston on 31 August 1852.  He was probably the last Anglican clergyman in Wales to be associated in such a way with the Methodists."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Gordon, Duchess of Gordon", "response": ["The duchess was an Episcopalian, but her sympathies were with those who were in conflict with the civil courts, though she was not disposed to identify herself with their movement. In 1846 her views changed. Believing that the Church of England was not constituted in accordance with the mind of the Lord, because it had no discipline, she left it after a long mental conflict, and joined the Free Church of Scotland. The leaders of the Free church, such as William Howels, were her personal friends, and often visited her house and held religious meetings under her roof. She came to occupy among evangelical Christians in Scotland the position that in former years had been held by the Countess of Leven and Viscountess Glenorchy."]}, {"page": "William Howells (minister)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Howels"]}]}}
