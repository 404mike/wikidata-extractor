Barson invited a friend of his to wait in the dressing room while he got changed, and this drew a rebuke from a director, a seven-day suspension was the result and Barson handed in a transfer request. With Tommy Ball proving an adequate replacement, the board agreed to his request.

In November 1923, Villa's centre-half Tommy Ball was killed by his neighbour, thus becoming the only active Football League player to have been murdered. In their Golden Jubilee season of 1923\u201324, Villa got through to the second final to be held at the then new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 2\u20130 to Newcastle United. This Cup final was to be something of a pinnacle though as Villa then had League finishes of sixth and tenth in the following seasons. The Directors attempted to stop the slump with transfer dealings. In 1927, they bought both Jimmy Gibson and Eric Houghton. In 1928, they bought in one of the most prolific goalscorers to have ever played in the English football league. When Villa signed Tranmere Rovers striker Tom Waring for \u00a34,700, he was relatively unknown. Waring scored a record 49 league goals in the 1930\u201331 season as Villa finished runners-up to Arsenal. One of the other purchases, Eric Houghton, scored 30 goals."]}, {"page": "Alf Miles", "response": ["Miles was called as a witness at the trial of George Stagg, who was found guilty of the murder of Aston Villa's defender Tommy Ball in November 1923."]}, {"page": "Sidney Rowlatt", "response": ["Rowlatt also heard murder trials, including that of George Stagg, who was found guilty of the murder of Aston Villa footballer, Tommy Ball in November 1923."]}, {"page": "George Stagg", "response": ["* George Stagg (died 1966), former policeman who murdered English footballer Tommy Ball"]}, {"page": "Shire Hall, Stafford", "response": ["Among those tried at the Shire Hall were the forger William Booth, who was convicted before Simon Le Blanc and subsequently hanged outside Stafford Gaol.
