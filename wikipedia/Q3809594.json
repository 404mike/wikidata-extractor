He is the author of critical studies of British theatre; of critical biographies of such important figures in Anglo-American film as Alfred Hitchcock, Alec Guinness, Orson Welles, Vivien Leigh, and Ingrid Bergman; of Strangers in Paradise: The Hollywood Emigres 1933\u20131950 (1983); and several books on art.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Hitchcock", "response": ["His favourite subject was geography, and he became interested in maps, and railway, tram and bus timetables; according to John Russell Taylor, he could recite all the stops on the Orient Express. He also had a particular interest in London trams. An overwhelming majority of his films include rail or tram scenes, in particular The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train and Number Seventeen. A clapperboard shows the number of the scene and the number of takes, and Hitchcock would often take the two numbers on the clapperboard and whisper the London tram route names. For example, if the clapperboard showed Scene 23; Take 3; Hitchcock would whisper \"Woodford, Hampstead\" \u2013 Woodford being the terminus of the route 23 tram, and Hampstead the end of route 3.", "Hitchcock was too young to enlist when the First World War started in July 1914, and when he reached the required age of 18 in 1917, he received a C3 classification (\"free from serious organic disease, able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home\u00a0... only suitable for sedentary work\").; \"Military service (medical grading\") , Hansard, vol. 107, 20 June 1918, 607\u2013642. He joined a cadet regiment of the Royal Engineers and took part in theoretical briefings, weekend drills, and exercises. John Russell Taylor wrote that, in one session of practical exercises in Hyde Park, Hitchcock was required to wear puttees. He could never master wrapping them around his legs, and they repeatedly fell down around his ankles.", "Hitchcock was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 February 1960 with two stars: one for television and a second for his motion pictures. In 1978, John Russell Taylor described him as \"the most universally recognizable person in the world\" and \"a straightforward middle-class Englishman who just happened to be an artistic genius\". In 2002, MovieMaker named him the most influential director of all time, and a 2007 The Daily Telegraph critics' poll ranked him Britain's greatest director. David Gritten, the newspaper's film critic, wrote: \"Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.\" In 1992, the Sight & Sound Critics' Poll ranked Hitchcock at No. 4 in its list of \"Top 10 Directors\" of all time. In 2002, Hitchcock was ranked 2nd in the critics' top ten poll and 5th in the directors' top ten poll in the list of The Greatest Directors of All Time compiled by the Sight & Sound magazine. Hitchcock was voted the \"Greatest Director of 20th Century\" in a poll conducted by Japanese film magazine kinema Junpo. In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ranked Hitchcock at No. 1 in its \"50 Greatest Directors\" list. Hitchcock was ranked at No. 2 on Empire magazine's \"Top 40 Greatest Directors of All-Time\" list in 2005.

These experts now believe the play may have been first brilliantly rehabilitated by Anthony Quayle's 1947 production at the Phoenix Theatre, starring Cyril Ritchard as Lord Foppington and brought to Broadway by Ritchard in 1950.

John Russell Taylor in Plays and Players praised the cast, which included Patricia Routledge as Berinthia and John Moffatt as Lord Foppington, but complained that the production was \"full of the simpering, posturing and sniggering which usually stand in for style and sophistication in Restoration revivals.\"John Russell Taylor, review in Plays and Players. Following Donald Sinden's outstanding and award-winning performance at the Aldwych Theatre in the mid-1960s Vanbrugh's original play is now again a favourite of the stage. A 2001 revival by Trevor Nunn at the National Theatre was described by Sheridan Morley as \"rare, loving and brilliantly cast.\" As so often with commentary on The Relapse, Morley focused on the role of Lord Foppington and its different interpretations: \"Alex Jennings superbly inherits the role of Lord Foppington which for 20 years or so belonged to Donald Sinden, and for another 20 before that to Cyril Ritchard.\"Sheridan Morley, \"Company Pride\", 28 July 2001, review in The Spectator."]}, {"page": "Tippi Hedren", "response": ["Hedren then told him Marnie would be their last film together and later recalled how Hitchcock told her he would destroy her career. \"I said I wanted to get out of my contract. He said: 'You can't. You have your daughter to support, and your parents are getting older'. I said: 'Nobody would want me to be in this situation, I want to get out'. And he said: 'I'll ruin your career'. I said: 'Do what you have to do'. And he did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years\". Hedren felt so humiliated, she called the director a \"fat pig\" in front of people on the set. Hitchcock made only a comment about it to his biographer, John Russell Taylor: \"She did what no one is permitted to do. She referred to my weight\". The two communicated only through a third party for the rest of the film.Taylor, p. 272. According to Marnie's screenwriter, Jay Presson Allen, Hitchcock was \"mad\" for Hedren.Spoto (2009), p. 180. She felt unhappy for both and described the situation as \"an old man's cri de coeur\", adding that Hitchcock had a \"Pygmalion complex about Tippi\".Moral (\"Marnie\"), p. 100. She advised Hedren to finish the film and then get on with her life and be happy. Hedren's hairdresser, Virginia Darcy, even told Hitchcock he should not be possessive with Hedren. \"Tippi felt rightly that she was not his property, but he'd say, 'You are, I have a contract'\". Although Hitchcock thought he might mend fences with Hedren and make another film with her, she refused to reconsider her decision.McGilligan, p. 685. Hedren's contract terms gave Hitchcock the final say as to any work she could take on and he used that power to turn down several film roles on her behalf. She was particularly disappointed when French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut told her he had wanted her for one of them. In 1966, Hitchcock finally sold her contract to Universal Studios after Hedren appeared in two of their TV shows, Kraft Suspense Theatre (1965) and Run for Your Life (id.).Moral (\"Marnie\"), p. 265.

Writing in The Times, John Russell Taylor found that, \"After a slowish beginning, which shows up the deficiencies of acting and direction, things really start hopping when a mysterious missile-like object discovered in a London excavation proves to be a relic of a prehistoric Martian attempt (successful, it would seem) to colonize Earth [...] The development of this situation is scrupulously worked out and the film is genuinely gripping even when (a real test this) the Power of Evil is finally shown personified in hazy glowing outline, a spectacle as a rule more likely to provoke titters than gasps of horror.\" Paul Errol of the Evening Standard described the film as a \"well-made, but wordy, blob of hokum\", a view echoed by William Hall of The Evening News who described the film as \"entertaining hokum\" with an \"imaginative ending\".Mayer, p. 152. A slightly more critical view was espoused by Penelope Mortimer in The Observer who said, \"This nonsense makes quite a good film, well put together, competently photographed, on the whole sturdily performed.

In the US, Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote that the film \"never really gets off the ground\" and \"remains a little too civilised and restrained for its own good.\" He praised the \"crispness\" of certain dialogue, along with the visual style and Parrish's direction, but argued that the story deserved \"a larger movie, at least one with more stratospheric sweep and suspense\". Judith Crist of New York magazine described Doppelg\u00e4nger as \"a science-fiction film that comes up with a fascinating premise three-quarters of the way along and does nothing with it.\" She commended the film for being \"nicely gadget-ridden\", as well as raising questions about the conflict between science and politics, but criticised the editing. Variety magazine considered the plot confusing, equating the Dove crash to the quality of the writing: \"Astronauts take a pill to induce a three-week sleep during their flight.
