John West (17 January 1809 \u2013 11 December 1873) emigrated from England to Van Diemen's Land in 1838 as a Colonial missionary, and became pastor of an Independent (Congregational) Chapel in Launceston's St. John's Square. He also co-founded The Examiner newspaper in 1842 and was later editor of The Sydney Morning Herald.\nWest was born in England, the son of The Reverend William West and his wife Ann, n\u00e9e Ball. \nWest emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (later renamed Tasmania) in 1839 where he officiated as an Independent minister at Launceston for sixteen years. West attracted half of the members of the Congregational ministry of Charles Price. West's contribution to Launceston and Australian life was great and varied promoting private and charitable enterprise. With James Aikenhead and J. S. Waddell, West founded The Examiner newspaper in 1842. He co-founded the London Agency Association to promote Colonial interests, an Immigration Society, the Mechanics' Institute, City Mission, Public Hospital, General Cemetery, and Cornwall Insurance Company in Launceston and the Hobart Town High School.\nJohn West was a leader in the movement seeking the abolition of transportation of convicts to the Australian Colonies. Affronted by the social, economic and moral effects of convictism, he promoted Colonial opposition to transportation from his pulpit and editorials in the Examiner and Hobart's Colonial Times, though historian Babette Smith has exposed West's demagogic rhetoric against convict society. He founded the Launceston Association for the Cessation of Transportation which developed into the first intercolonial political organisation, the Australasian Anti-Transportation League, in Melbourne in 1851. For this occasion he collaborated on the design of the League banner, the precursor to the Australian National Flag. The success of united action against Transportation, which was abolished in 1853, led West to expand his interest in representational government through his essays on Federation, Union of the Colonies, (under the pseudonym John Adams) published locally and in The Sydney Morning Herald during 1854.\nIn 1854 the proprietor of The Sydney Morning Herald, John Fairfax, invited John West to become its first official editor, and West moved to Sydney from where he guided debate on matters of colonial, national and international importance until his sudden death in Woollahra, Sydney, in 1873. His two-volume History of Tasmania, published in 1852, analysed the development of the Colony, the penal system and the condition of the Aboriginal people. Later research disclosed few errors, and West is regarded as one of the founders of Australian historical writing. He is honoured by the Examiner-John West Memorial Lecture in Launceston and the John West Medal at the University of Sydney.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Black War", "response": ["Boyce has claimed that the April 1828 \"Proclamation Separating the Aborigines from the White Inhabitants\" sanctioned force against Aboriginal people \"for no other reason than that they were Aboriginal\" and described the decision to remove all Aboriginal Tasmanians after 1832\u2014by which time they had given up their fight against white colonists\u2014as an extreme policy position. He concluded: \"The colonial government from 1832 to 1838 ethnically cleansed the western half of Van Diemen's Land and then callously left the exiled people to their fate.\" As early as 1852 John West's History of Tasmania portrayed the obliteration of Tasmania's Aboriginal people as an example of \"systematic massacre\" and in the 1979 High Court case of Coe v Commonwealth of Australia, judge Lionel Murphy observed that Aboriginal people did not give up their land peacefully and that they were killed or forcibly removed from their land \"in what amounted to attempted (and in Tasmania almost complete) genocide\"."]}, {"page": "The Examiner (Tasmania)", "response": ["The Examiner was first published on 12 March 1842, founded by James Aikenhead. The Reverend John West was instrumental in establishing the newspaper and was the first editorial writer. At first it was a weekly publication (Saturdays). The Examiner expanded to Wednesdays six months later. In 1853, the paper was changed to tri-weekly (Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays), and first began daily publication on 10 April 1866. This frequency lasted until 16 February the next year. Tri-weekly publication then resumed and continued until 21 December 1877 when the daily paper returned."]}, {"page": "Cooee", "response": ["One of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries hinges on the use of \"cooee\". \"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\" is solved partly because, unlike everyone else, Holmes recognises the call is commonly used among Australians. However, author and missionary to Tasmania, Reverend John West (1809-1873), reported in 1852 that \"cooey\" was \"not unknown in certain neighbourhoods of the metropolis\" (London). In 1864, an English slang dictionary reported: \"Cooey, the Australian bush-call, now not unfrequently heard in the streets of London\". In 1917, the Anglo-Welsh poet Edward Thomas used \"coo-ee\" as the parting word with his wife Helen, on leaving for the Western Front from which he never returned; a fact commemorated at a 2014 Remembrance service in Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Andrew Garran", "response": ["Andrew and Mary Garran left South Australia in 1856 for Sydney, New South Wales, after John Fairfax offered Andrew the position of assistant editor at the Sydney Morning Herald. The family lived in a terrace on Phillip Street, near Martin Place, where they kept a dairy cow, which would graze during the day in The Domain. While working for the Herald, Garran studied at the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1868 and a Doctorate of Laws in 1870. When the editor of the Herald, John West, died in December 1873, Garran was promptly promoted. Garran was one of the earliest supporters of the federation of Australia, and used his position in the media to advocate the cause, writing many editorials in favour of federation. He served as editor until 1885, when poor health forced him to resign, after spending nearly thirty years at the newspaper."]}, {"page": "Joseph Coles Kirby", "response": ["The family migrated to Sydney in 1954 when his father's business went bankrupt but the 17-year-old Kirby was able to find work at another flour-mill in Sydney.

By 1851 it had expanded to other colonies including New South Wales and Victoria and soon expanded to become the Australasian Anti-Transportation League. In the first partial-election of the Legislative Council of Van Diemen's Land on 21 October 1851, members of the Australasian Anti-Transportation League won all 16 of the elected seats, showing how popular the movement had become, and how opposed to transportation the free population of Van Diemen's Land was. One of the first actions taken by the new Council was to vote 16 to 4 in favour of sending a letter of request to Queen Victoria asking for her to revoke the Order in Council permitting transportation to Van Diemen's Land and Norfolk Island, despite the opposition of Lieutenant Governor William Denison."]}, {"page": "Charles Price (minister)", "response": ["Price preached in Launceston from August 1832 to January 1833, when he was invited to become the first minister of Pitt Street Chapel, Sydney, the first Congregational church in Australia.

Here he accepted the charge of Tamar Street Congregational Chapel, the pulpit of which he occupied until his death in Launceston in 1891.

For this, the colonial press accused the government of extreme negligence, and also called for the removal of lieutenant-governor George Arthur. In The History of Tasmania (1852), John West wrote that, of all the escapes from Van Diemen's Land, \"never was the government more culpable, or the prisoners less so, than in the instance of the Badger\".West, John (1852).
