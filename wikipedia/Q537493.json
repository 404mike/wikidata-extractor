In the early 1980s, she worked with the group Osibisa. She is best known for her hit single \"Say I'm Your Number One\" which made the UK Top Ten in 1985.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kylie Minogue", "response": ["Kylie Ann Minogue  (; born 28 May 1968), also known mononymously as Kylie, is an Australian singer and actress. Minogue is the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time, having sold over 80\u00a0million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music and fashion, for which she is referred to by the European press as the \"Princess of Pop\" and a style icon. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, three Brit Awards and 17 ARIA Music Awards.", "Born and raised in Melbourne, Minogue first achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, playing tomboy mechanic Charlene Robinson. She gained prominence as a recording artist in the late 1980s and released four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. By the early 1990s, she had amassed several top ten singles in the UK and Australia, including \"I Should Be So Lucky\", \"The Loco-Motion\", \"Hand on Your Heart\", and \"Better the Devil You Know\". Taking more creative control over her music, Minogue signed with Deconstruction Records in 1993 and released Kylie Minogue (1994) and Impossible Princess (1997), both of which received positive reviews. She returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with 2000's Light Years, including the number-one hits \"Spinning Around\" and \"On a Night Like This\". The follow-up, Fever (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Two of its singles, \"Love at First Sight\" and \"In Your Eyes\", became hits, but its lead single, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units.", "===1993\u20131998: Kylie Minogue and Impossible Princess===", "By 1997, Minogue was in a relationship with French photographer St\u00e9phane Sednaoui, who encouraged her to develop her creativity.Baker and Minogue, pp. 107\u2013112 Inspired by a mutual appreciation of Japanese culture, they created a visual combination of \"geisha and manga superheroine\" for the photographs taken for Minogue's sixth album Impossible Princess and the video for \"German Bold Italic\", Minogue's collaboration with Towa Tei.Baker and Minogue, pp. 108\u2013109 She drew inspiration from the music of artists such as Shirley Manson and Garbage, Bj\u00f6rk, Tricky and U2, and Japanese pop musicians such as Pizzicato Five and Towa Tei.Baker and Minogue, p. 108 The album featured collaborations with musicians including James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore of the Manic Street Preachers. Impossible Princess garnered some negative reviews upon its release in 1997, but would be praised as Minogue's most personal and best work in retrospective reviews. In 2003, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani called it a \"deeply personal effort\" and \"Minogue's best album to date\", while Evan Sawdey, from PopMatters, described Impossible Princess as \"one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created\" in a 2008 review. Mostly a dance album, Minogue countered suggestions that she was trying to become an indie artist.", "Acknowledging that she had attempted to escape the perceptions of her that had developed during her early career, Minogue commented that she was ready to \"forget the painful criticism\" and \"accept the past, embrace it, use it\". The music video for \"Did It Again\" paid homage to her earlier incarnations.Baker and Minogue, p. 113 Retitled Kylie Minogue in the UK following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, it became the lowest-selling album of her career. At the end of the year, a campaign by Virgin Radio stated, \"We've done something to improve Kylie's records: we've banned them.\" In Australia, the album was a success and spent 35 weeks on the album chart. Minogue's Intimate and Live tour in 1998 was extended due to demand.Baker and Minogue, p. 125 She gave several live performances in Australia, including the 1998 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, and the opening ceremonies of Melbourne's Crown Casino,Baker and Minogue, p. 129 and Sydney's Fox Studios in 1999 (where she performed Marilyn Monroe's \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\") as well as a Christmas concert in Dili, East Timor, in association with the United Nations Peace-Keeping Forces. She played a small role in the Australian-made Molly Ringwald 2000 film Cut.", "In November 2004, Minogue released her second official greatest hits album entitled Ultimate Kylie. The album yielded two singles: \"I Believe in You\" and \"Giving You Up\". \"I Believe in You\" was later nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of \"Best Dance Recording\". In March 2005, Minogue commenced her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour. After performing in Europe, she travelled to Melbourne, where she was diagnosed with breast cancer, forcing her to cancel the tour. She underwent surgery in May 2005 and commenced chemotherapy treatment soon after. It was announced in January 2006 that she had finished chemotherapy and the disease \"had no recurrence\" after the surgery. She would continue her treatment for the next months. In December 2005, Minogue released a digital-only single, \"Over the Rainbow\", a live recording from her Showgirl tour. Her children's book, The Showgirl Princess, written during her period of convalescence, was published in October 2006, and her perfume, \"Darling\", was launched in November. The range was later augmented by eau de toilettes including Pink Sparkle, Couture and Inverse.", "In July 2010, Minogue released her eleventh studio album, Aphrodite. The album featured new songwriters and producers including Stuart Price as executive producer. Price also contributed to song writing along with Minogue, Calvin Harris, Jake Shears, Nerina Pallot, Pascal Gabriel, Lucas Secon, Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley and Kish Mauve. The album received favourable reviews from most music critics; Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's \"finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess\" and Tim Sendra from Allmusic commended Minogue's choice of collaborators and producers, commenting that the album is the \"work of someone who knows exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection\". Aphrodite debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom, exactly 22 years after her first number one hit in the United Kingdom. The album's lead single, \"All the Lovers,\" was a success and became her 33rd top ten single in the United Kingdom, though subsequent singles from the album, \"Get Outta My Way\", \"Better than Today\", and \"Put Your Hands Up\", failed to reach the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. However, all the singles released from the album have topped the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.", "From Minogue's work on her sixth studio album, Impossible Princess, her songwriting and musical content began to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences.Baker and Minogue, Hodder and Stoughton, 2002. p 111. She had written lyrics before, but called them \"safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that\".John Walsh. \"Lucky in Luck\". Vogue. November 1997. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said that the album bears a resemblance to Madonna's Ray of Light. He said that she took inspiration from \"both the Brit-pop and electronica movements of the mid-'90s\", saying that \"Impossible Princess is the work of an artist willing to take risks\". Her next effort, Light Years is a disco-influenced dance-pop record, with AllMusic's Chris True calling it \"Arguably one of the best disco records since the '70s\". True stated that her eighth album, Fever, \"combines the disco-diva comeback of Light Years with simple dance rhythms\". Her ninth album, Body Language was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a \"successful\" attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance. Incorporating styles of dance music with funk, disco and R&B, the album was listed on Qs \"Best Albums of 2003\".", "Minogue has been recognised with many honorific nicknames, most notably the \"Princess of Pop\". Jon O'Brien of AllMusic reviewed her box-set Kylie: The Albums 2000\u20132010 and stated that it \"contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses.\" In January 2012, NME critics ranked her single \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" at number four on their Greatest Pop Songs in History list. Channel 4 listed her as one of the world's greatest pop stars. In 2020, Rolling Stone Australia placed her at number three on its 50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time list."]}, {"page": "Mike Stock (musician)", "response": ["===The Hit Factory: Bananarama, Mel and Kim, Princess (1985\u201386)===", "In 1985 the trio built a new studio at \u2018The Vineyard\u2019 recording studio complex, The Borough that would later be dubbed 'The Hit Factory'.
