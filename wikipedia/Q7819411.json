He wrote the school's initial curriculum and, with the help of his musical collaborator, saxophonist Arnie Lawrence, recruited a faculty of jazz artists including Sir Roland Hanna, Tommy Flannigan, Chico Hamilton, Jimmy Heath, Donald Byrd, Reggie Workman, and Red Mitchell. Offering New York's first undergraduate degree in jazz, the school has since grown to become internationally recognized as one of the most influential conservatories in its discipline."]}]}}
