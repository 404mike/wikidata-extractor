Despite's Speight's success, McNally was appointed in his place amid protests from supporters. He was to soon silence his doubters, as with the help of successful new signings of David Glenn, Milton Graham and John Kelly, the Blues finished runners\u2013up in Division Four for only their second promotion since joining the Football League in 1931. Although he had to contend with the loss of key players Andy Holden and the prolific Stuart Rimmer through injury, Chester sealed promotion with three games still to play."]}, {"page": "Doug Allder", "response": ["In October 1977, Allder joined Fourth Division club Brentford on trial. He quickly became the regular left winger in the team and signed a contract. The Bees were promoted to the Third Division at the end of the season, after securing a fourth-place finish. Allder had an infamous brawl with Sheffield United's Mick Speight during a match at Griffin Park in November 1979, which resulted in the fight spilling over into the Sheffield United dugout and both players being sent off. Allder was released at the end of the 1979\u201380 season and made 95 appearances and scored three goals during his time at Griffin Park."]}, {"page": "John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["He became manager of Chester City in January 1984, who were struggling at the foot of the Fourth Division, but some improved results (including a derby win over Wrexham) gave cause for optimism for the following season. McGrath added experience in players such as John Butcher, Steve Fox, Mick Speight and Nigel Walker but Chester continued to struggle at the wrong end of the table. He lost his job in December 1984, after a 5\u20131 loss to Stockport County. Although results were not always impressive, McGrath began to mould the side that would to go on to win promotion in 1985\u201386 after further strengthening by Mick Speight and Harry McNally. McGrath gave future England international Lee Dixon his first taste of regular first-team football when at Chester."]}]}}
