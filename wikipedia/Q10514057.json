He played for Hibernian, Airdrieonians, Dumbarton and Falkirk.Whiteford started his senior career with Hibernian, but was unable to establish himself in the first team and was given a free transfer. He signed for Airdrie and served the club with distinction, making over 400 total appearances including the 1975 Scottish Cup Final in which he was captain (lost to Celtic) as well as winning 1973\u201374 Scottish Division Two title and 1976 Spring Cup, plus another runner-up medal from the 1971\u201372 Texaco Cup. In 2016 he was voted into the Diamonds 'Greatest XI' by supporters.After retiring as a player, Whiteford managed Albion Rovers, Dumbarton (alongside Alex Wright) and then Airdrieonians.
