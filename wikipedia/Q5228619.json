A minister's son, he was born in Sussex in the UK and brought up in London. He gained a BA in Photographic Arts in 1976 following a passion in communicating visually. In 1976, following another passion, he walked 1,000 miles across Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming to help raise awareness of conservation issues for the World Wildlife Fund. On this journey his photographs, radio and television interviews were his introduction to a world of media co-operation that would steer his next thirty years in environmental activism.In 1979 he volunteered as a photographer on board the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior during its Icelandic anti-whaling campaign where he first met Allan Thornton, Greenpeace's director at the time. In 1983, while he was working in public relations photography and teaching, Thornton persuaded him to join another anti-whaling ship, \"Balaenoptera\". With Jennifer Lonsdale, another Greenpeace veteran, they carried out undercover work in the Norwegian port of Vado, posing as journalists to gain entry to whaling factories. They were able to truthfully insist they were not working for Greenpeace as the factory workers feared, but knew it was unwise to state they were on an independent environmental activist ship. The campaign was incredibly successful resulting in a two-thirds reduction in whaling quotas and huge embarrassment for the Norwegian government.From 1978 to 1986 he often contributed to Wildlife magazine and later when it became BBC Wildlife, for a while being their \"roving naturalist\" to places such as the Everglades National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and Baja California, Mexico. He also acted as a book and television reviewer for the magazine. His nature photography was widely used during this period and he was described as \"one of the new breed of naturalist photographers, with a commitment to conservation and the style of a photojournalist.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ivory", "response": ["Since the ivory ban, some Southern African countries have claimed their elephant populations are stable or increasing, and argued that ivory sales would support their conservation efforts.

The African elephant was placed on Appendix I in January 1990. Since then, some southern African countries have had their populations of elephants \"downlisted\" to Appendix II, allowing the domestic trade of non-ivory items; there have also been two \"one off\" sales of ivory stockpiles.\"To Save An Elephant\" by Allan Thornton & Dave Currey, Doubleday 1991 "]}, {"page": "Curry (surname)", "response": ["*Dave Currey (environmentalist) (born 1953), British environmentalist, photographer and writer"]}, {"page": "Environmental Investigation Agency", "response": ["The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) is an international NGO with offices in London and Washington D.C.

A popular decorative ivory work is scrimshaw, which is etched ivory with black or colored pigments. Ivory has been manipulated since prehistoric times and as a material has been used in religion, as jewelry, piano keys, decorative arts, and other products. The demand for ivory has caused specific animals to become endangered, including the African and Asian Elephant. Ivory is a coveted material throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia that is illustrated in religious objects, art, and demonstrates wealth.
