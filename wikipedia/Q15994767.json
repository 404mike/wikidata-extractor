Early highlights were the mapping of new pathways of inositol phosphate synthesis.\nTogether with his long-time collaborator Phillip Thomas Hawkins, he established that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is the main substrate of receptor-controlled Type 1 phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), thus identifying PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as the key output signal produced by this enzyme.\nThey identified and isolated the GPCR-activated Type 1B PI3K (PI3K\u03a5) and, in a sustained body of work, defined its structure, explained its complex pattern of regulation by G\u03b2\u03a5 and Ras, and proved its role in inflammatory events in vivo.\nThey \u2013 in parallel with Dario Alessi \u2013 identified phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 as the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-activated link between PI3K-1 activation and protein kinase B activation, a key pathway through which PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 formation regulates cell proliferation and survival. Later, they showed that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was responsible for the recruitment of both PKB and PDK1 to the membrane, and therefore the activation of the former by the latter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leonard R Stephens", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leonard R.
