Lee McEvilly put the visitors ahead on eight minutes before a header from Stuart Wardley levelled the match in the 34th minute.  Eleven minutes after half-time, Paul Simpson scored from distance with a curling shot before Rushden saw a potential equalising goal from Onandi Lowe disallowed for a foul. Garry Butterworth then scored for Rochdale in the 72nd minute from the edge of the penalty area, and the match ended 2\u20132.  The second leg of the semi-final took place three days later at Spotland in Rochdale.  After a goalless first half, Mark Peters scored an own goal when his backpass rolled into the Rushden goal to give Rochdale the lead.  Immediately from the restart, Butterworth's pass found Lowe who turned and scored to make it 1\u20131.  In the 75th minute, Hall took advantage of a mistake by Griffiths to go round Billy Turley, the Rochdale goalkeeper, and score the deciding goal.  Rushden won the match 2\u20131 and progressed to the play-off final with a 4\u20133 aggregate victory.", "|LM ||7||Garry Butterworth "]}]}}
