The film tells how he teams up with guitarist Richard Holgarth, who then gets a band together for Otway's 2,000th gig at the London Astoria. Promoter Paul Clerehugh explains how the band gives Otway all his credibility back whilst Otway goes on to reveal his next big scheme\u2014playing the Royal Albert Hall which is only \"twice as big\" as the Astoria. Here the film highlights just how limited Otway's musical talent is as he struggles to sing along to the specially commissioned orchestration with his first band\u2014the Aylesbury Youth Orchestra. The only time he gets it right is on the night in front of a sellout crowd\u2014much to his relief. It was also around this time that Otway and his fans embarked on one of their biggest publicity stunts to date. Coming up to the millennium, the BBC conducted a poll to find out what the nation thought were the greatest lyrics of all time. Otway fan Ali Mclean explains how it occurred to him that people voting were likely to vote for a number of different songs by various more successful artists, but if the Otway fans focussed their attention on just one song, they may just have a chance of getting into the top 10. The plan worked, with Beware of the Flowers, Cos I'm Sure They're Gonna Get You, Yeah reaching number seven in the chart"]}, {"page": "Holgarth, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Holgarth"]}]}}
