After the initial wave, it appears that there were only eight more toys produced, and only two additional minicomics, though most of the new toys came with the old ones. The Simonson series told a complete story in itself, and did not include the eight new characters. The principal figures, the humanoid Wastors, did not transform, nor did most of the other robots in the line, though many could be disassembled and reassembled, and had motorized parts. Also, there was a tendency toward making new characters out of the same molds as other characters, but in different colors, which is more true of the first wave than of the second. Consumer Reports' Penny Power, when it reported on robot toys, found them the least satisfying of all the lines covered, though it must be said that the narrative aspects of all the lines were ignored, and the magazine would extol the economic value of Gobots (\"sturdy and cheap\") over Transformers in later issues."]}, {"page": "Manglor", "response": ["The original 1980s line was very controversial for its advertising that promoted that not only could the figures be stretched and squashed, but could be torn apart and \"return almost like new to their original yucky selves.\"  Consumers Union's children's publication, Penny Power, took on this claim and found that they could not get the product to live up to its advertising claims, leaving a Manglodemon in many pieces that they were unable to reassemble.  The packaging of the toys encouraged children to mix and match the parts of the various Manglors, but it was not possible to get them to hold together as demonstrated. These figures also have been very hard to find in good condition."]}, {"page": "2014 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Mrs Penny Power. Founder, Ecademy.
