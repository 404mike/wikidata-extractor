Prout secured the position of Painter in Water-Colours in Ordinary to King George IV in 1829 and afterwards to Queen Victoria. John Ruskin, whose work often emulated Prout's, wrote in 1844, \"Sometimes I tire of Turner, but never of Prout\". Prout is often compared to his contemporaries; Turner, Gainsborough, Constable and Ruskin, whom he taught. He was the uncle of the artist John Skinner Prout.", "link_mentions": {}}}
