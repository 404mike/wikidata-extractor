In the 1920s he was film critic of the London Evening Standard, and a founder of the London Film Society, before joining the film industry.\nIn 1928 he became Literary Adviser and Scenario Editor at the newly founded studio British International Pictures at Elstree, sometimes working with his friend Alfred Hitchcock. He was by his own account the principal author of Hitchcock's first BIP film The Ring (1927), and credited as the author of the original story on which Champagne (1928) was based. Their friendship does not seem to have survived their collaboration.\nMycroft was elevated to head of production at Elstree during the 1930s, during which time BIP was reconstituted as the Associated British Picture Corporation. The company released many films on which Mycroft was credited as producer, with varying levels of actual involvement. His adopted son, David Rees Mycroft worked as assistant director on a number of Elstree productions.\nDavid Mycroft, who isn't mentioned in Walter Mycroft's autobiography The Time of My Life, edited by Vincent Porter and published posthumously, was an experimental filmmaker, poet and psychologist who studied with R.D. Laing. David Mycroft's daughter Ruth Novaczek is a British experimental film maker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Hitchcock", "response": ["When he returned to England, Hitchcock was one of the early members of the London Film Society, newly formed in 1925. Through the Society, he became fascinated by the work by Soviet filmmakers: Dziga Vertov, Lev Kuleshov, Sergei Eisenstein, and Vsevolod Pudovkin. He would also socialise with fellow English filmmakers Ivor Montagu and Adrian Brunel, and Walter C. Mycroft."]}, {"page": "Number Seventeen", "response": ["Hitchcock returned to England from a trip to the Caribbean with a new idea for a film. He told John Maxwell about it, but Maxwell said that Walter C. Mycroft had a different film for him to do: a filmed version of Joseph Farjeon's play Number Seventeen. Hitchcock was unhappy with this project, as he considered the story to be too full of cliches and he wanted to do a version of John Van Druten's London Wall. The director Thomas Bentley who eventually got to do London Wall at the time, wanted to direct Number Seventeen.Spoto, 1999. p. 129"]}, {"page": "Murder!", "response": ["Murder! is a 1930 British thriller film co-written and directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Herbert Marshall, Norah Baring and Edward Chapman.
