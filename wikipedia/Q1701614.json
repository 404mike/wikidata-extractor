Rothenstein's 1956 Tate Gallery exhibition 'Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism' was actually a Lewis retrospective with very few Vorticist works. And the inclusion of work by Bomberg, Roberts, Wadsworth, Nevinson, Dobson, Kramer under the heading 'Other Vorticists' \u2013 together with Lewis's assertion that 'Vorticism, in fact, was what I, personally, did, and said, at a certain period' \u2013  incensed Roberts as it seemed that he and the others were being set up to be mere disciples of Lewis.A letter of 15 November 1964 from Lilian Bomberg to William Lipke in the Tate Gallery archive explains that David Bomberg 'was very angry indeed and I think rightly so that he was included in the Wyndham Lewis Tate Gallery exhibition'. The case made by Roberts in the five 'Vorticist Pamphlets' that he published between 1956 and 1958See John Roberts, 'A Brief Discussion of the Vortex Pamphlets', which first appeared in William Roberts, Five Posthumous Essays and Other Writings (Valencia, 1990). was hampered by the absence of key works, but led to other self-published books by Roberts which included early studies of his abstract work.William Roberts,  Some Early Abstract and Cubist Work (London, 1957) and William Roberts, 8 Cubist Designs (London, 1969). A broader survey was provided by the d'Offay Couper Gallery's 'Abstract Art in England 1913\u20131914' exhibition in 1969.11 November\u20135 December 1969."]}, {"page": "Stanley Spencer", "response": ["In October 1938 Spencer had to leave Cookham and moved to London, spending six weeks with John Rothenstein before moving to a bedsit in Swiss Cottage. There was now no realistic hope of reconciliation with Carline and he was already distanced from Preece, who had rented out Lindworth so effectively evicting Spencer. At this low point Spencer painted four of the canvases in the Christ in the Wilderness series. He originally intended to paint a series of 40, one representing each day of Jesus's sojourn in the wilderness, but in the end only eight were completed and a ninth was left unfinished. By September 1939, he was staying at Leonard Stanley in Gloucestershire with the artists George and Daphne Charlton. Spencer created many important works in his room above the bar of the White Hart Inn which he used as a studio, including Us in Gloucestershire and The Wool Shop. While in Gloucestershire, Spencer also began a series of over 100 pencil works, now known as the Scrapbook Drawings, which he continued to add to for at least ten years."]}, {"page": "Leon Underwood", "response": ["Throughout the 1950s, Underwood concentrated on his sculpture and on promoting his theories and philosophy of art. In 1961 Underwood was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Sculptors and further recognition followed in 1969 when the first full-scale retrospective of his work was held at The Minories in Colchester. The art historian John Rothenstein wrote in the introduction to that exhibition that Underwood was \"..the most versatile artist at work in Britain today..\". However it was to be over forty years before the next major retrospective of his work was held, in 2015 at the Pallant House Gallery. This lack of attention has been attributed to the range and versatility of Underwood's output which, across the various media he worked in, lacked a common recognisable style that was easy to promote and also to his, sometimes, complex and esoteric philosophies and theories on art."]}, {"page": "William Roberts (painter)", "response": ["Alongside his dramatic Cubist work, Roberts was a talented portrait painter. He honed his skills with portraits of Sarah \u2013 she would be his model and muse for the next 60 years.Michael Parkin, 'Obituary: Sarah Roberts', The Independent, 5 December 1992. In 1923, while Roberts was preparing for a one-man show at the Chenil Gallery, Chelsea, the artist Colin Gill put Roberts in touch with T. E. Lawrence, who commissioned a series of portraits for his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Finally shaking off his association with Wyndham Lewis, Roberts had evolved a unique and highly recognisable 'English Cubist' style. His subject matter turned to urban life in London with paintings such as Bank Holiday in the Park  Bank Holiday in the Park, 1923. and At the Hippodrome, At the Hippodrome, 1920. which were exhibited with the London Group, and The Cinema The Cinema, 1920.  \u2013 later acquired by the Tate Gallery. David Cleall, 'At the Hippodrome', in Sarah MacDougall and Rachel Dickson (eds.), Uproar! The First 50 Years of The London Group 1913\u201363 (London: Lund Humphries, 2013). At this stage his oeuvre was quite broad, including scenes from 'Greek Mythology [and] Christian Mythology', as he put it.William Roberts, A Reply to My Biographer Sir John Rothenstein (London, 1957); quoted in Five Posthumous Essays and Other Writings, p. 159. Lawrence commissioned further illustrations and decorations for Seven Pillars of Wisdom, and there were also commissions of literary portraits and cover designs for private presses \u2013 such as a portrait of H. E. Bates for the New Coterie magazine in 1927. It was the purchase of a number of his paintings by the Contemporary Art Society for major provincial art galleries that kept Roberts financially afloat. He supplemented his income by teaching a life class with Bernard Meninsky at the Central School of Art for one day a week from 1925 \u2013 a post he held until 1960. Towards the end of the twenties his work became less down-beat. For example, The Tea Garden (1928)The Tea Garden, 1928. and The Chess Players (1929) The Chess Players, 1929\u201330. provide a light take on social interaction and were perfectly in tune with the fashionable Art Deco style.", "In 1956 the Tate Gallery held an exhibition entitled Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism, with 150 works by Lewis and a small selection by other artists to give \"an indication of the effect of his immediate impact upon his contemporaries\". Roberts was offended that the catalogue \"would lead the uninitiated to suppose that the artists designated as 'Other Vorticists' are in some way subservient to Lewis\",William Roberts, Cometism and Vorticism \u2013 A Tate Gallery Catalogue Revised (London, 1956); repr. in Five Posthumous Essays and Other Writings, pp. 151\u20132. and published a series of \"Vortex Pamphlets\",See John David Roberts, \"A Brief Discussion of the Vortex Pamphlets\", in Five Posthumous Essays and Other Writings, pp. 151\u20137. in which he railed against the exhibition, the catalogue, the press coverage and the account of his own career contained in Modern English Painters by the Tate's director, John Rothenstein, which appeared at about the same time. Targets of earlier visual satires had included Walter Sickert and Roger Fry. To publicise his own work he also published Some Early Abstract and Cubist Work 1913\u20131920 (London, 1957), the first of a series of collections of reproductions of his paintings, with somewhat polemical prefaces."]}, {"page": "William Orpen", "response": ["A memorial exhibition of Orpen's work was held in New York in 1932 and the Royal Academy also held a memorial exhibition in 1933, part of which travelled to the Birmingham City Art Gallery. Orpen's former friend Augustus John vilified him after his death, and an account in Wyndham Lewis's 1937 autobiography of an encounter between the two in Cassel during the war further tarnished Orpen's reputation. In 1952 the then Director of the Tate Gallery, John Rothenstein, who was related to Orpen by marriage, published Modern English Painters which, despite its title, included a chapter on Orpen that comprehensively criticised every aspect of his work and personality. This had a huge influence, and for many years Orpen was largely forgotten. Other than the collection of his war paintings in the 'Orpen Gallery' of the Imperial War Museum, only two of Orpen's works were regularly on display in Britain, The Mirror in the Tate and A Women in Leeds City Art Gallery. A major retrospective of his work was held at the National Gallery of Ireland in 1978, but was not shown in Britain. Bruce Arnold's 1981 biography revived interest in Orpen among scholars, and in 2005 a major retrospective which also included his peacetime work was held at the Imperial War Museum, and led to a reappraisal of his place in British and Irish culture."]}, {"page": "William Rothenstein", "response": ["He married Alice Knewstub in 1899 with whom he had four children: John, Betty, Rachel and Michael.
