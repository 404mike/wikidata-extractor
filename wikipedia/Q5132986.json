He worked on his father's farm, Scarr Barn Farm at Crawshawbooth near Rossendale, which he eventually inherited.\nIn 1922 Kenyon joined the Labour Party and the next year was elected to Rawtenstall Council, of which he became Mayor from 1938 to 1942. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Lancashire in 1941. At the 1945 general election, Kenyon was elected as Labour Member of Parliament for Chorley.\nKenyon was a rare farmer on the Labour benches and often took up agricultural issues. He opposed agricultural subsidies and British membership of the European Economic Community. In 1950 he almost lost his seat to Andrew Fountaine, even though Fountaine's nomination by the Conservatives had officially been withdrawn. He remained a backbencher, and in the 1966 Parliament he was chairman of the Committee of Selection which chose members for other committees. The Liberal Party criticised him for picking only one Liberal MP to sit on the Standing Committee examining the 1968 Finance Bill.\nAt the 1970 general election, Kenyon retired; his seat went to the Conservative candidate Constance Monks.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Clifford Kenyon"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Clifford Kenyon"]}, {"page": "Andrew Fountaine", "response": ["During the 1940s, Fountaine also became involved with the Conservative Party, with his speeches becoming one of the highlights of the annual party conference, such as during the 1948 conference when he denounced the Labour Party as consisting of \"semi-alien mongrels and hermaphrodite communists\".R.
