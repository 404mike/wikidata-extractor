McGeever died on 16 August 2015.", "An illegal immigrant from Ukraine, she arrived in the village in the back of a haulage truck driven by Carl King (Tom Lister) and ran away, hiding in the Dingles' barn. She was found and befriended by Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) and Will Wylde (Oscar Lloyd), whom she told that it was dangerous for anyone to know she was there. She later became friends with Sam Dingle (James Hooton) who tended to her injured leg and offered her shelter and protection as she explained she wanted to work to send money back to her young son in Ukraine. When Sam's father Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) and stepmother Lisa Dingle (Jane Cox) eventually discovered her, she was welcomed into the Dingle homestead and Sam got her a job working at the B&B for Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell). Recently, however, she seems to have become uncomfortable at Sam's romantic advances. When Wishing Well Cottage was destroyed, she moved in with Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock), Eli Dingle (Joseph Gilgun) and Lizzie Lakely (Kitty McGeever). In early April, Sam proposes to Olena, which she says no to, because she doesn't have a passport. Later, Sam goes to Cain and asks him to help him get a fake passport for Olena. Zak soon learns about it and tells Olena to leave Sam alone and that when she gets her fake passport he wants her to leave the village. She and Eli soon realise that they have feelings for each other and share a kiss. Sam invites Olena to the Dingles' party celebrating Lisa's release from prison, which she accepts, but doesn't want to. Zak goes round to Tall Trees Cottage and tells her to stay away. When Olena doesn't come, Sam goes to look for her, and spots her and Eli kissing.
