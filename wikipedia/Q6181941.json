He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School.  Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister."]}, {"page": "Southern Cathedrals Festival", "response": ["*1992 Jeremy Suter, Master of the Music, Carlisle Cathedral"]}, {"page": "List of musicians at English cathedrals", "response": ["* 1991 Jeremy Suter"]}, {"page": "Charles Harrison (musician)", "response": ["* 1998 \u2013 Comfort & Joy: Music for Advent, Christmas, Epiphany and Candlemas, with Jeremy Suter (director) and Carlisle Cathedral Choir"]}]}}
