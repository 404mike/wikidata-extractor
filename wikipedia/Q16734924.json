Near the peak of this first generation of the gothic scene in 1983, The Face Paul Rambali recalled that there were \"several strong Gothic characteristics\" in the music of Joy Division. In 1984, Joy Division's bassist Peter Hook named Play Dead as one of their heirs: \"If you listen to a band like Play Dead, who I really like, Joy Division played the same stuff that Play Dead are playing. They're similar.\""]}, {"page": "Joy Division", "response": ["Curtis was the band's sole lyricist, and he typically composed his lyrics in a notebook, independently of the eventual music to evolve. The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis's imagery and word choice often referenced \"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\". In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.\" Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that \"Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,\" while noting that \"the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.\" Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard were \"obvious influences\" to Curtis, and Morris also remembered the singer reading T. S. Eliot. Deborah Curtis also remembered Curtis reading works by writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse."]}, {"page": "Nick Kent", "response": ["Along with his contemporaries, such as Paul Morley, Charles Shaar Murray, Paul Rambali and Danny Baker, Kent is widely considered one of the most important and influential UK music journalists of the 1970s. He wrote for the British music publication New Musical Express, moving to The Face later on in his career.  Kent's writing predominantly covers the lives and music of rock-and-roll musicians. His prose is laced with images of self-destruction and compassion, exploring the reality of being an artist in the late twentieth century. Kent is the author of two books: The Dark Stuff, a collection of his journalism and Apathy for the Devil: A 1970s Memoir which is an autobiographical account of his life and experiences in the 1970s, published in March 2010."]}, {"page": "Abebe Bikila", "response": ["In 1992, Yamada Kazuhiro published the first full biography about Abebe, written in Japanese and published in Tokyo; it was entitled Do You Remember Abebe? (). Since then, there have been at least three biographical works based on his life. Among these is Triumph and Tragedy, written in English by his daughter Tsige Abebe and published in Addis Ababa in 1996. The other two, also written in English, are Paul Rambali's 2007 fictional biographical novel Barefoot Runner and Tim Judah's 2009 Bikila: Ethiopia's Barefoot Olympian. According to the journalist Tim Lewis's comparative review of the two books, Judah's is a more journalistic, less-forgiving biography of Abebe. It refutes the mythical aspects of his life but recognises Abebe's athletic accomplishments. Judah's account of Abebe's life differs significantly from Rambali's, but confirms (and frequently cites) Tsige's biography. For example, Lewis cites the discrepancy in the circumstances surrounding Abebe's car accident:"]}, {"page": "Into the Music", "response": ["Don Snowden of the Los Angeles Times described Into the Music as \"a more personal, more definitely Van Morrison album than Wavelength\", but complained that \"Bright Side of the Road\" and \"You Make Me Feel So Free\" lacked the \"rhythmic punch and melodic substance\" of the artist's early-1970s R&B songs and that elsewhere, \"tempos often drag when they should push and few of the melodies make any lasting impression.\" Snowden also wrote: \"Despite sporadically interesting passages, the four songs on the second side carry on far too long.\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Reviewing for the NME, Paul Rambali welcomed Morrison's return to Veedon Fleece-style musical arrangements but said, with the exception of \"Full Force Gale\" and \"Rolling Hills\", they lacked the precision that Jeff Labes had brought to the artist's earlier work and instead \"merge the songs into a jaunty, lightweight mass\". He also said that Morrison's singing lacked conviction and concluded: \"I hate records like this \u2013 neither particularly good nor especially bad but just, well, pleasant. They hang there frustrating you in the run-off grooves ... And I hate this even more because Van Morrison made it, and because he set out with the right idea this time, too.\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required)."]}, {"page": "Let Me Talk", "response": ["Paul Rambali of NME found that the song is \"without a recognisable disco beat. Just goes to show that modern soul music is alive and kicking harder at conformity than its recently revived predecessor. Let Me Talk commits the usual Earth, Wind & Fire crime of spoiling the funk with some Vegas showtime horn arrangements, but these are thankfully at a minimum and entirely outweighed by an irresistible riff\". Rambali added \"This record gives off such a compulsive, joyous, frenzied noise that it's hard to sit still and type, but I can't resist pointing out that amongst more than a few lyrical platitudes it contains the sharpest admonishment of modern culture you're likely to hear from any source. Earth, Wind & Fire narrow it down to just one line, pointing the finger to people who Try to find excitement in the labels that they wear! And that doesn't just mean the labels in clothes, either.\" Robert Christgau of the Village Voice said \"Let Me Talk,\" is too political in its fluffy way to break down the racism to today's top 40\"."]}, {"page": "List of Old Emanuels", "response": ["*Paul Rambali \u2013 Music journalist & author"]}, {"page": "Rambali, Paul", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Rambali"]}, {"page": "Gustave Rudman Rambali", "response": ["Son of a british rock critic from NME, Paul Rambali, he was born in Paris, France and began learning piano as a child at his local conservatory.
