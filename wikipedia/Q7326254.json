A historian of antiquity (he claimed to distrust history written concerning periods subsequent to 600 AD) he was particularly noted for a life of St. Patrick. He discovered that ecumenical work was particularly restricted in the context of the Troubles in a diocese lying on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which he accordingly resigned to take up a professorship in Systematic Theology in the Faculty of Theology at Manchester University. During this period he worked notably on the evolution of Christian theology in the period between (and immediately prior to) the Councils of Nicea (325 AD) and Constantinople (381 A. D.) He was the first British or Irish contributor to the Sources Chr\u00e9tiennes collection of early Christian writings. Among his writings was Reasonable Belief which was written jointly with his brother. In the introduction he notes \"One of the authors is an Anglican priest and the other an Anglican bishop, and neither can jump out of his skin\" (p. x) and \"It should perhaps be explained that this book is not only a collaboration between two Anglican theologians but between two identical twin brothers\" (p. xi).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bishop of Clogher", "response": ["| Richard Hanson"]}, {"page": "Richard P C Hanson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Hanson (bishop)"]}, {"page": "Richard PC Hanson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Hanson (bishop)"]}, {"page": "Richard Hanson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Richard Hanson may refer to:", "*Richard Hanson (1879\u20131948), Canadian politician", "*Richard Hanson (bishop) (1916\u20131988), bishop of Clogher in the Church of Ireland, 1970\u20131973", "*Richard Hanson (Australian politician) (1805\u20131876), British-Australian chief justice of South Australia", "*Richard Hanson (Missouri politician), secretary of state of Missouri in 1994", "*Richard Hanson Weightman (1816\u20131861), delegate to the United States Congress from the Territory of New Mexico"]}, {"page": "Richard P.C.
