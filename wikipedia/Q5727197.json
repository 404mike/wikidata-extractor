He was a right-handed batsman who played first-class cricket for Essex. He was born in Weobley, Herefordshire and died in Highgate.\nPreece made two first-class appearances for Essex during the 1895 County Championship, having made his first cricketing appearances for Cheshire in 1893. Despite having a rather good first-class debut, in which he scored 19 in the first innings and 49 in the second, his second and final appearance was less fortunate, as his only batting contribution was six runs in the second innings.\nPreece made no further first-class appearances beyond this.", "link_mentions": {}}}
