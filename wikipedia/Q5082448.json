He had little success in his two first-class matches, scoring 26 runs with a highest score of 15. He was described by Wisden as \"possessing a fine drive\". He played his club cricket for Alton Cricket Club, being dismissed in unusual fashion while playing for them when he was bowled by Henry Roberts after the ball had deflected off, and killed, a swallow. A member of the Middle Temple, he was called to the bar in 1902, where he practiced on the Western Circuit. Bentinck served in the Rifle Brigade with the 13th Battalion in the First World War, being appointed a temporary lieutenant in February 1915, with appointment to the temporary rank of captain in October of the same year.

In contrast to many of their previous game, the weather was good, and on winning the toss, Hampshire decided to bat first. Charles Seymour batted well for the visitors, accruing 57 out of Hampshire's 146 runs, but Fowler was again the best of the Somerset bowlers, collecting four wickets for nine runs to help restrict the Hampshire total. Ramsay top-scored for Somerset in their reply, accumulating 71 runs before being bowled, while a number of other batsmen made useful scores to help Somerset to their total of 214. Edward Western, the Somerset secretary batted in his only innings of the season for the county, coming in as the last man, but he failed to score a run. Somerset struggled to collect wickets when Hampshire batted again, and tried eight different bowlers without much success. Their fielding was described by the Bristol Mercury as being \"loose\", but when the sixth wicket was taken, with 232 runs scored, the rest followed reasonably quickly, and Hampshire finished on 290. Fowler was dismissed early in Somerset's chase, but Newton and Sainsbury put on 118 runs together to help their towards victory. Sainsbury was dismissed for 63, but Newton continued to bat, putting on 80 runs before being dismissed. Somerset eventually reached the required total with five wickets remaining to achieve their first win of the season."]}, {"page": "Charles Seymour (disambiguation)", "response": ["Charles Seymour (1885\u20131963) was an American academic, historian and President of Yale University.", "Charles Seymour may also refer to:", "* Charles Seymour, 2nd Baron Seymour of Trowbridge (1621\u20131665)", "* Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662\u20131748)", "* Charles Seymour (cricketer) (1855\u20131934), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Charles Seymour, cricketer, was born in Winchfield"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Charles Seymour (1879) : C.
