It\u2019s also the only one in the run to be served up in two parts with the concluding half on Thursday. Sophie Rundle, who\u2019s currently being so ballsy in Peaky Blinders, stars as the terrifyingly young-looking detective constable Fiona Griffiths with Russell Tovey as a fellow cop. I was really looking forward to the moment when Fiona would solve her first murder by actually talking to the dead, or more specifically, the moment when the dead would talk to her. But like Wire in the Blood and Waking the Dead, that title promises much more spookiness than it delivers.\"", "Ellen Jones of The Independent published a slightly more positive review, writing; \"Detective Fiona Griffiths began her first day in a new job by clumsily dropping all her casework folders at the feet of her CO. Apparently, she's old enough to be investigating murders, despite looking approximately 12. You may recognise the actress as 25-year-old Sophie Rundle, who plays Ada Shelby in BBC2's Peaky Blinders. That's the more glamorous role, but it's her performance in this two-part crime drama that really reveals Rundle's charm. This adaptation clearly struggled to sort the story's myriad details into a properly paced sixty minutes, but once you gave up on following the murder plot, there was plenty else to enjoy. The four previous one-off dramas in Sky Living's Drama Matters series have varied from unsatisfying morsels to hearty dramatic meals.
