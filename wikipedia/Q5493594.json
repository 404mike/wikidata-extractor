He spent much of his career with Swindon Town, for whom he played in the Premier League. In 2008, he found new fame through repeated references to \"Fraser Digby's washbag\" on Danny Baker's 6\u20130\u20136 programme on BBC Radio 5 Live.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Day", "response": ["In the summer of 2001, Day joined Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer, following his release from Watford. He made his QPR debut in a 1\u20130 victory over Stoke City in August 2001. He made 19 more appearances during the 2001\u201302 season, despite being dropped in October 2001 due to the arrival of Fraser Digby. Shortly after, Day suffered a broken leg in a home game against Oldham Athletic after a challenge with striker Matthew Tipton. As part of his lengthy recovery plan, he was loaned to non-League Aylesbury United in October 2002, and made his debut for the club in a 0\u20130 home draw against Harrow Borough. He made seven appearances for Aylesbury, playing his last game for the club in December 2002, a 1\u20131 draw away to Basingstoke Town. Day returned to the QPR first\u2013team towards the latter stages of the 2002\u201303 season. He played in goal for the rest of the season, and was part of the team that lost 1\u20130 in the play\u2013off final to Cardiff City in the Millennium Stadium."]}, {"page": "Kenny Allen (footballer)", "response": ["In September 1985, he left Plainmoor to join Swindon Town again on a free transfer. He played 40 league games the following season as Swindon won the Fourth Division title, but early the following season he lost his place to Fraser Digby, only playing a further 5 league games, before being transferred back to Torquay in December 1986 as a replacement for John Smeulders."]}, {"page": "Gary Walsh", "response": ["The return of Les Sealey (who had been at United for 18 months until the end of the 1990\u201391 season) in January 1993 meant that Walsh was now third choice goalkeeper, and the following season he was transfer-listed. He had also been out the squad for a while before Sealey's arrival, as United had brought in Fraser Digby on loan from Swindon Town as an (unused) understudy to Peter Schmeichel."]}, {"page": "Gino Padula", "response": ["After leaving Wigan in 2001 and spending a year in Argentina his most successful spell came at QPR, where he became somewhat of a cult hero. Padula was signed in 2002 by then QPR manager Ian Holloway who he had worked with during his spell at Bristol Rovers. He initially found it hard to break into the first team. Padula made his debut for the club as a substitute against Barnsley on 17 August 2002. His first start for QPR came on 2 November 2002 against Port Vale, however in the first half goalkeeper Simon Royce was sent off and substitute goalkeeper Fraser Digby was brought on for Padula. He eventually got his chance due to injuries from January 2003, and he finally started to display his tough slide tackling and steely determination. Padula became an overnight fan-favourite and one of the first names on the team sheet. As his confidence grew, he became more and more attacking and his prowess from dead balls became legendary with the QPR faithful. He scored his first goal for the club against Port Vale, the same team he was disappointingly substituted off against months earlier."]}, {"page": "Nick Hammond", "response": ["Hammond joined Swindon Town on a free transfer in July 1987, and while there he twice broke his leg which resulted in him taking the number 23 shirt for the 1993\u201394 Premier League campaign, rather than the unlucky number 13.
