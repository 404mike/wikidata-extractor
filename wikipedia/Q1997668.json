He made his first Luton appearance of 2015\u201316 in a 3\u20132 win away to Exeter City on 19 December.

Following the appointment of Nathan Jones as Luton manager, Howells' run in the first-team continued, playing in every match under Jones' management until picking up a knee injury, for which he underwent a scan. Shortly after, it was confirmed Howells would require a knee operation, resulting in a spell on the sidelines. He returned to first-team football as a 94th-minute substitute for Josh McQuoid in a 3\u20132 win away to Oxford United on 16 April 2016.

A month later on 23 October 2012, Tubbs scored the club's third goal of the game, to equalise, in a 3\u20133 draw against Notts County. Manager Eddie Howe acknowledged his lack of first team football but wanted to keep him to help Bournemouth's target. This proved to be paid-off, as he scored three more goals later in the 2012\u201313 season and helped the club reach promotion to the Championship.
