She made a local success in Manchester, where she was brought up, and in 1923 made a successful London debut. Her career, encouraged by the conductor Sir Hamilton Harty, quickly developed, with breaks in the first years for vocal study in Milan.\nBaillie's career was almost wholly as a concert singer: she only once acted in an opera production on stage. She was associated above all with oratorio, becoming well known for her many performances in  Handel's Messiah, Haydn's The Creation, Mendelssohn's Elijah and the choral works of Elgar.\nDuring a long  career, Baillie sang in complete recordings of Messiah, Elijah, Beethoven's Missa solemnis and Ninth Symphony. In the 1940s she formed a friendship with the contralto Kathleen Ferrier, with whom she appeared frequently in concert and made several recordings of duets. She took part in 19 annual Three Choirs Festivals from 1929. She made her American debut in 1933 and between then and her retirement from the concert platform in the mid 1950s she sang in the US, New Zealand, the Far East and Africa as well as in Europe.\nIn her later years, Baillie was a teacher in the Royal College of Music, Cornell University and the Royal Manchester School of Music.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1983 in music", "response": ["*September 24 \u2013 Isobel Baillie, operatic soprano, 88"]}, {"page": "Roy Henderson (baritone)", "response": ["He also became very distinguished in works by Ralph Vaughan Williams, including A Sea Symphony, Dona Nobis Pacem, Sancta Civitas and Five Tudor Portraits; in those of Edward Elgar, especially The Dream of Gerontius, The Kingdom, and The Apostles; in Bach's St Matthew Passion and St John Passion; and in Mendelssohn's Elijah.

In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps, factories and other workplaces. Within this organisation Ferrier began working with artists with international reputations; in December 1941 she sang with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in a performance of Messiah together with Isobel Baillie, the distinguished soprano.Leonard, pp. 40\u201341 However, her application to the BBC's head of music in Manchester for an audition was turned down.Fifield (ed.), p. 17Ferrier, p. 45 Ferrier had better fortune when she was introduced to Malcolm Sargent after a Hall\u00e9 concert in Blackpool.
