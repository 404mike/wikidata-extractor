His forward play with Old Hill Wanderers and Halesowen earned him a good reputation, and there was strong competition in the Birmingham area for his signature. He joined Second Division champions Small Heath in September 1893, and made his debut in the Football League on 16 September, scoring a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win at home to Walsall Town Swifts. Izon played his part in the club finishing in runners-up spot, but was unable to displace the prolific Frank Mobley or Fred Wheldon, and played only 26 games in three-and-a-half years. He moved on to Walsall in January 1897.", "link_mentions": {}}}
