His forward play with Old Hill Wanderers and Halesowen earned him a good reputation, and there was strong competition in the Birmingham area for his signature. He joined Second Division champions Small Heath in September 1893, and made his debut in the Football League on 16 September, scoring a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win at home to Walsall Town Swifts. Izon played his part in the club finishing in runners-up spot, but was unable to displace the prolific Frank Mobley or Fred Wheldon, and played only 26 games in three-and-a-half years. He moved on to Walsall in January 1897.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1893\u201394 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Of the regular first-team members from the previous season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 71. Fred Speller, who had suffered a badly broken leg early in the season, had been playing in practice matches and was believed to be back to full fitness. Fringe players Harry Edwards and Fred Jones had left the club,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 85, 102. and Harry Morris had retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Goalkeeper George Hollis, backs Arthur Littleford, Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns, Teddy Jolley and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Frank Mobley, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon all remained with the club. Newcomers included forwards Jack Lee, Charles Izon and Walter Jackson, all signed from non-league clubs in the West Midlands area. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 8\u20139. The team adopted a new kit, keeping the white knickerbockers but replacing the royal blue shirt and stockings with shirts in a lighter shade of blue, with navy collar trim, cuffs and pocket and navy stockings.", "In the return fixture against Walsall, Charles Izon, a well-built forward who \"is quick on the ball, and shoots excellently\", scored a hat-trick on his debut as Small Heath again won comfortably. A visit to Liverpool gave Caesar Jenkyns the honour of scoring the first Football League goal conceded by the home side, but the visitors \"fell all to pieces\" in the second half, and were decisively beaten. The young and inexperienced Smith made mistakes that cost two goals, but the forwards \"were undoubtedly the weak spot\", and the Birmingham Daily Post's reporter suggested they would \"have to learn to shoot harder and play with far more spirit if they are to keep up the reputation they gained last season\". After Burslem Port Vale \"beat Small Heath on Monday in more decided a fashion than did Liverpool\", by five goals to nil, the poor form shown in the previous two matches by the forwards, and by Wheldon in particular, was much improved at Ardwick. Although Small Heath scored only once, the resultant win was enough to take them into October in second place in the division, having already completed a quarter of the 28-game league programme.", "Changes were made for the visit of Middlesbrough Ironopolis, Arthur Littleford, Charles Izon and Bernard Pumfrey coming in for Smith, Mobley and Jack Hallam. The half-backs were again the backbone of the team, and Wheldon, who produced \"a brilliant exposition of dodging and shooting\", scored the winning goal five minutes from time in what the Standard's reporter described as a \"rattling good game\". Fred Speller was reported to have \"not been seen in such form since his leg was broken last year\" in a Boxing Day friendly with top amateur club Marlow, the club from which he signed for Small Heath. Their last League match of 1893, a comfortable 6\u20130 victory against Lincoln City, took them into the new year in second place in the division, three points ahead of Notts County but two points behind Liverpool, who had played two fewer matches. Pumfrey strengthened the defence, George Hollis was as usual secure in goal, and the forwards, with the returning Mobley and the introduction of reserve-team player Walter Jackson, \"showed better combination and greater dash than they have recently done\"."]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["In mid-October, former England international forward Dennis Hodgetts joined from Aston Villa.
