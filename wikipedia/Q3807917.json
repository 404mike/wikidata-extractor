She told Joe Nazzaro of Make-Up Artist Magazine that the biggest challenge for her was transforming Williams into Monroe. Shircore said Williams' features are quite different from Monroe's, but she did not want to use prosthetics to shape her face as the emotion Williams was conveying in her performance had to come through the make-up. Shircore explained \"There are times in the film when she's actually wearing very little make-up but we still kept tiny aspects of Marilyn, such as the eyebrows, the shading and the shape of the lips, so we would keep three or four major points that helped us towards Marilyn. Some of it was quite difficult, because Michelle's eyes are completely different. Marilyn had very distinctive eyelids, so we had to try and form that shape on Michelle's eyes by the use of light and shade.\" The make-up artist said most of the scenes in the film see the actors from The Prince and the Showgirl in their film make-up, so Shircore had to copy the original scene for My Week with Marilyn and get it right. She also revealed a few minor prosthetics were used on some cast members to help recreate the characters. Shircore told Nazzaro \"I'm not going to give them away, but they are things that make a difference and they're all beautifully conceived, produced and worn by the actors.\""]}, {"page": "Coloma Convent Girls' School", "response": ["* Jenny Shircore, make-up artist"]}, {"page": "List of accolades received by The Young Victoria", "response": ["Vall\u00e9e's movie garnered various awards and nominations following its release, with most nominations recognizing its costume design and Blunt's acting performance.
