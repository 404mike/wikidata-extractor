For instance, there is no repeat of the exposition; according to the late Malcolm MacDonald, the music is so \"powerfully organic and continuously unfolding\" that such a repeat would hinder forward progress.", "Arnold Schoenberg, in his essay Brahms the Progressive (Brahms is often characterized as a conservative composer), pointed out several thematic relationships in the score, as does Malcolm MacDonald in his biography of the composer. The first half of the chaconne theme is anticipated in the bass during the coda at an important point of the preceding movement; and the first movement's descending thirds, transposed by a fifth, appear in counterpoint during one of the final variations of the chaconne."]}, {"page": "Klangfarbenmelodie", "response": ["Schoenberg himself employed the technique in his 1928 orchestration of the \"St. Anne\" organ Prelude BWV 552 from J.

Malcolm MacDonald says of this arrangement, \"The gamut of colour\u2014including harp, celesta and glockenspiel, six clarinets of various sizes, and a very agile bass tuba is brilliantly kaleidoscopic. The instrumentation has a serious purpose, however: it emphasizes structural divisions ... and, above all, brings out the individual contrapuntal lines.\" A sequence of constantly changing timbres may be clearly heard in Schoenberg's rendering of the following passage:"]}, {"page": "Flute Sonata (Poulenc)", "response": ["The sonata is in three movements, taking a total of 12 minutes in performance.Poulenc, p. 1 The score was published in France and Britain shortly after the premiere.

His gigantic World Requiem (1919\u20131921), in memory of the dead of all nations, was performed at the Royal Albert Hall, conducted by Foulds, under the auspices of The Royal British Legion on Armistice Night, 11 November, in 1923 by up to 1,250 instrumentalists and singers; the latter were called the Cenotaph choir. Performances in 1924 and 1925 took place at the Queen's Hall. In 1926 it returned to the Albert Hall, but this was to be the last performance until 2007, again at the Albert Hall. The performances in 1923\u201326 constituted the first Festivals of Remembrance. While some critics were not impressed by the work, it was nonetheless popular. One newspaper wrote: \"The scope of the work is beyond what anyone has dared to attempt hitherto. It is no less than to find expression for the deepest and most widespread unhappiness this generation has ever known. As such it was received by a very large number of listeners, who evidently felt that music alone could do this for them.\" However, the work ceased to be performed after 1926. Some commentators have suggested a conspiracy against Foulds \u2013 his biographer Malcolm MacDonald has, for instance, implied some sort of \"intrigue\". It appears Foulds was regarded as an inappropriate composer for the occasion because he had not fought in the war, or because of his suspected Left-wing views.", "Foulds became a footnote to English music after his death, but from 1974 Malcolm MacDonald, editor of the music journal Tempo under the alias Calum MacDonald, conducted an often lonely campaign for Foulds after he came across the Foulds scores deposited in the British Library. MacDonald tracked down Foulds' daughter, who took him to a garage and showed him two coffin-sized boxes full of sketches and manuscripts she had been left by her mother. Unfortunately, many of the manuscripts were damaged: apparently, rats and ants had got at them while they were in India, where Foulds' wife stayed after his death.", "According to Malcolm MacDonald's account, both were in unhappy marriages and it was love at first sight. Rather than enter into a clandestine affair, they laid the matter before their respective spouses. The two couples met together and agreed amicably on the divorces which would allow John and Maud to marry, though they did not in fact do so until 1932. They were to have two children: John Patrick born in 1916 and a daughter Marybride in 1922.", "* String Quartet No. 4 in F minor (1899) (According to Malcolm MacDonald, Foulds wrote ten quartets, five of them before 1900, but did not give any of them numbers.

Simms believes Copland's interest in Schoenberg's methods began in the early 1920s while studying under Nadia Boulanger. By 1928, Copland had analyzed Schoenberg's Suite for Piano and began experimentally composing with tone rows and other serial methods. An early example that both Copland and Simms cite is \"Poet's Song\", a 1927 setting of an E. E. Cummings poem. In 1930, Copland incorporated a motive, its retrograde, and its retrograde-inversion into his Piano Variations, along with other applications of serial techniques. This interest in serial and twelve-tone music continued to influence Copland and the composition of the Short Symphony, not only in the work's dissonance but also in sketches which show that Copland wrote out themes for the symphony in retrograde, inversion, and retrograde-inversion. The music critic Malcolm MacDonald also notes the use of retrograded and inverted patterns in the symphony's second movement.", "The symphony was lauded by others. Carlos Ch\u00e1vez wrote to Copland in December 1934: \"It is impossible to tell you in a few words how much I enjoy the Little Symphony.\" Copland thanked Ch\u00e1vez in 1946 for also including the symphony as one of the ten \"most deserving modern works\", a list featured in Minna Lederman's journal Modern Music. The composer and critic Arthur Berger commends the work in his review of the 1944 premiere in The New York Sun, admiring that the symphony had \"feelings in their essence\", though he notes that many of the dissonances were \"accidentally interpolated\" during the performance. Berger later writes in his 1953 biography of Copland that the symphony \"must be included among [Copland's] masterpieces\". In his 1985 review of a recording of the symphony, Alan Stout describes the Short Symphony as \"one of the undisputed masterpieces of the thirties\" and a work that \"looks forward to\" symphonies by Stravinsky. He also observes that the piece is \"more often written about than heard\". In a 2000 article, Malcolm MacDonald praises the work as \"masterly\" and \"one of the most impressive achievements of the 1930s modernism\".", "*  \"Calum MacDonald\" is the alias of Malcolm MacDonald."]}, {"page": "Malcolm MacDonald (classical music critic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Malcolm MacDonald (music critic) "]}]}}
