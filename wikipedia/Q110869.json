The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.", "Umbriel, along with another Uranian satellite, Ariel, was discovered by William Lassell on October 24, 1851.
