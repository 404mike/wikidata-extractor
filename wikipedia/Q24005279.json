Adam Le Fondre was nominated for January's Championship Player of the Month, and was announced as the winner of the award the following day. The team's next game was a 2\u20130 defeat at home to Sheffield Wednesday with former Reading loanee Benik Afobe scoring the second for the visitors. The task was made harder when Alex Pearce was sent off after only nine minutes for bringing down Afobe in the penalty area. After the game the club appealed the red card and successfully had it overturned. Reading recovered from the disappointing home defeat to win 3\u20131 away at promotion rivals Queens Park Rangers.
