He is mostly noted as a playmaking lynchpin at Arsenal with whom he won six trophies from 1930 to the 1936 season. James featured as a deep-lying creative midfielder who provided a link between defence and attack. He was famed for his high level of footballing intelligence, outstanding ball control and supreme passing.\nJames was described by Tom Finney as \"an inspiration\" and \"pure magic\" with his style of play eventually leading to comparisons with Dennis Bergkamp. His rheumatism meant he wore \"baggy\" shorts so as to conceal the long johns he put on for warmth. His baggy attire became his own trademark look displayed upon the field of play.", "link_mentions": {}}}
