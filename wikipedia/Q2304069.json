He is mostly noted as a playmaking lynchpin at Arsenal with whom he won six trophies from 1930 to the 1936 season. James featured as a deep-lying creative midfielder who provided a link between defence and attack. He was famed for his high level of footballing intelligence, outstanding ball control and supreme passing.\nJames was described by Tom Finney as \"an inspiration\" and \"pure magic\" with his style of play eventually leading to comparisons with Dennis Bergkamp. His rheumatism meant he wore \"baggy\" shorts so as to conceal the long johns he put on for warmth. His baggy attire became his own trademark look displayed upon the field of play.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arsenal F.C.", "response": ["With a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's budget grew rapidly. Their location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925. Over the next five years, Chapman built a new Arsenal. He appointed an enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker, implemented Charlie Buchan's new twist on the nascent WM formation, captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, and lavished Highbury's income on stars like David Jack and Alex James. With record-breaking spending and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club."]}, {"page": "1930s", "response": ["* Alex James (Scottish footballer)"]}, {"page": "1920s", "response": ["* Alex James (Arsenal and Scotland soccer player)"]}, {"page": "1953", "response": ["* June 1 \u2013 Alex James, Scottish football (soccer) player (b. 1901)"]}, {"page": "Golders Green Crematorium", "response": ["* Alex James, footballer"]}, {"page": "Bill Shankly", "response": ["Shankly played for Scotland 12 times from 1938 to 1943 in five full and seven wartime internationals.Shankly, p. 6.

Ramsey was selected to play for Becontree Heath School when he was only seven years old, playing at inside-left alongside boys as old as fourteen; his nine-year-old brother Len was at inside-right. Alf's selection for the school team prompted the purchase of his first pair of football boots. Two years later, aged nine, he became captain of the school team. By this point he had switched to playing at centre-half\u2014the key position of the \"WM\" formation then favoured in British football, between the full-backs and the forwards. His main strength was generally perceived to be his extremely accurate passing; his chief shortcoming was a lack of pace, for which Ramsey compensated by learning to read the game and position himself well. Ramsey played for teams representing the schools of Dagenham and Essex County respectively, and trialled unsuccessfully for the London schools team while at Becontree. While he was at school, his brother Albert took him to see his first Football League match, watching their favourite team, West Ham United, play against Arsenal. This was the only senior match Alf would attend before playing in them himself. He later wrote that his main recollection of it was the performance of one of the Arsenal forwards, the Scotland international Alex James."]}]}}
