Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United on the final day of the season. However, in February Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour \u2013 though once again a story that the players sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did he find out that this was only because he was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he still lived in the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the move on the condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, so as to not disrupt the club's title bid. The secret was revealed in a matter of hours, as an unknown person informed the press."]}, {"page": "Luton Town F.C.\u2013Watford F.C. rivalry", "response": ["|Bert Mitchell"]}, {"page": "List of Northampton Town F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Bert Mitchell || 20", "|align=left| Bert Mitchell || 46"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bert Mitchell"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bert Mitchell"]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["A strange feeling of disharmony set in at the Victoria Ground prior to the start of the 1948\u201349 season and Stoke received a number of transfer requests from players on the slightest whim.
