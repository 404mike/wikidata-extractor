McMullen's films are grounded in philosophy, history, psychoanalysis and literature. McMullen's exhibition Signatures of the Invisible brought together artists and scientists working at CERN, the European particle physics facility near Geneva. His other work includes filming conversations with physicists at Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre, which he describes as \"making a diary of the transition in human culture\" because he believes physics is arriving at another shifting point. His latest work Arrows of Time is a radical new form of cinema consisting of 40 interchangeable elements that deal with literature, philosophy, and contemporary physics, premiered at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco in April 2007.\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s McMullen also lectured and took tutor groups and what was then 'The London College of Printing and Distributive Trades' - now the London College of Communication. Attached to the department of Film and Television studies at the college's Back Hill facility, McMullen was popular with students.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 31", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 Ken McMullen, English director, producer, and screenwriter"]}, {"page": "Jacques Derrida", "response": ["In 1980, he received his first honorary doctorate (from Columbia University) and was awarded his State doctorate (doctorat d'\u00c9tat) by submitting to the University of Paris ten of his previously published books in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project under the title \"\" (\"Inscription in Philosophy: Research on the Interpretation of Writing\").Powell (2006), p. 145.
