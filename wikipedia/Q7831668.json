Davison's character, Anthony Webster, is frequently at pains to explain that he is a histopathologist, for example.  Their case load therefore infrequently verges into the more \"exciting\" area of crime-related death. Nevertheless, one of the running gags of the programme was that the character originally played by Tracy-Ann Oberman (and in later series by Matilda Ziegler), the anatomical pathologist Ruth Anderson, was secondarily credentialled as a forensic pathologist, but had so rarely used these skills that her deductive reasoning skills were faulty.", "*Dr. Ruth Anderson (Tracy-Ann Oberman, Matilda Ziegler) \u2014 Ruth's approach to pathology is decidedly more relaxed than that of Dr. Webster.

She is the only licensed forensic pathologist on staff, but this credential has gone mostly unused.  Where Webster was drawn to pathology for serious scientific and familial reasons, she chose the career path apparently because of its romanticisation in popular culture.  When the odd forensic case does arrive, she's quick to dust off her credentials, and equally quick to draw the wrong conclusions.
