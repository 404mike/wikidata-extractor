Walker and McAvennie forged a successful partnership up front whilst Paul McStay enjoyed his finest season, winning both the SPFA and Scottish Football Writers player of the year awards.  Celtic clinched the league title on 23 April 1988 with a 3\u20130 win over Dundee in front of what appeared to be an overcrowded Celtic Park.  The latter stages of the Scottish Cup provided plenty drama for fans.  In the semi-final against Hearts, Celtic trailed 0\u20131 going into the final three minutes and looked devoid of inspiration until Hearts' goalkeeper Henry Smith fumbled a cross which was thumped into the goal by Mark McGhee to level the match.  A replay looked certain until in injury time, Smith under pressure from McGhee failed to deal with another ball into the box, with Andy Walker scoring the winner from close range.  The Cup Final, on 14 May 1987, saw Dundee United take the lead early in the second half.  Frank McAvennie equalised in 75 minutes, heading an Anton Rogan cross past United goalkeeper Billy Thomson.  With about a minute remaining, McAvennie scored again to win the Cup for Celtic."]}, {"page": "Clint Hill (footballer)", "response": ["On 17 June 2016, Hill joined Scottish Premiership side Rangers on a one-year deal preceding his release from Queens Park Rangers.

He famously won the Scottish Cup in 1991, playing most of the second half plus thirty minutes of extra time with broken ribs, a ruptured spleen and intermittent double vision sustained in a collision with Dundee United defender John Clark. Despite his injuries, Maxwell stretched to tip a fierce goal-bound shot from Dundee United defender (and future Motherwell manager) Maurice Malpas over the bar with two minutes of extra time remaining, to ensure Motherwell ran out 4-3 winners. However, he did not play for the club during the next season due to a contract dispute with manager Tommy McLean, who brought in the experienced Billy Thomson and Dutchman Sieb Dijkstra to fill the position."]}]}}
