Opening the batting, Scott made 46 and 52, and retained his place for much of the rest of the season thanks to some solid scores including what was to prove his only first-class century, 109 against Gloucestershire in mid-July. He finished the 1981 season with 968 first-class runs at 26.08, including that hundred and six further half-centuries though his one-day form was less impressive as his top score was only 42.\nScott began the 1982 season fairly well established in the Worcestershire side, but a succession of low scores saw him play only occasionally from mid-season onwards. In 1983 he forced his way back into the first team, but again did poorly, making a pair against Nottinghamshire in July in what turned out to be his penultimate first-class match (he made 23 and 21 in his last, against Essex in late August).\nScott left Worcestershire for Sussex in 1984, and remained for 1985 as well, but never played a first-team game for that county and after a year out of county cricket he returned to New Road in 1987 to begin an unusual final chapter of his Worcestershire career. He never played first-team cricket for the county again, but for six seasons he captained the Second XI, often coming in at the bottom of the order despite his batting ability. Against Hampshire II in 1991 he made 2 from number 11 in the first innings, then when Worcestershire followed on he opened the batting and hit 181! He amassed 61 not outs from 94 innings during these years in the seconds.\nIn 1993 Scott was part of the victorious Old Hill team which beat local rivals West Bromwich Dartmouth in the final of the Abbot Ale National Club Championship at Lord's, and six years later he made one final List A appearance for the Worcestershire Cricket Board XI against Hampshire Cricket Board in the NatWest Trophy.\nScott is one of very few Level 4 cricket coaches in the world and is now coaching the Gresham's School First XI cricket team in Holt, a small town in Norfolk, England. He took the First XI on a tour to Barbados (#YOBO) for their pre-season in his first week with the team and that turned out to be a successful tour, in which Frankie Sutton failed to score a 100.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Scott", "response": ["Mark Scott may refer to:", "*Mark Scott (singer), lead singer of The Miracles", "*Mark Scott, also known as SHY, part of the Scottish rapper and songwriter duo SHY & DRS", "*Mark Scott (radio host) (1936\u20132005), American talk show host", "*Mark Scott (actor) (1915\u20131960), TV actor and host of the TV series Home Run Derby", "*Mark Scott (businessman) (born 1962), vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney and former managing director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "*Mark Scott (cricketer) (born 1959), English cricketer", "*Mark Scott (footballer) (born 1959), Australian rules footballer", "*Mark Scott (police officer), Australian Federal police officer killed in the Garuda plane crash", "*Mark Scott (rower) (1923\u20132013), British rower", "*Mark Scott, victim of serial killers Dean Corll and Elmer Wayne Henley"]}, {"page": "List of Worcestershire Cricket Board List A players", "response": ["*Mark Scott (1999): MS Scott"]}]}}
