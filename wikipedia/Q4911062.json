Despite this, the club's dire finances meant that he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic). Vale started the season with a club-record unbeaten 18 matches, and Lee began playing midfielder Tommy McLaren on a regular basis. Vale's financial situation was highlighted by the fact that they could not afford the \u00a3500 registration fee for Ian Buxton following the player's departure from Notts County. The \"Valiants\" were knocked off the top of the table following a bout of injuries, and Lee was forced to sign wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston. Speaking of their third-place finish, Lee said that \"no team could have deserved reward as much for their hard work and strength of character\"."]}, {"page": "David Harris (footballer, born 1953)", "response": ["Born in Stoke-on-Trent, his father was Wilf Harris, who had a trial with Stoke City in his youth. A tall defender, rose through the ranks of Port Vale juniors after being signed from junior team Abbey Hulton United. He signed his first professional contract in July 1973, with Vale then in the Third Division. He went on to make his debut in a 3\u20131 win over Rochdale on 3 November 1973 after Bill Summerscales was suspended and Roy Cross injured. Over the course of the 1973\u201374 season he scored five goals in 36 games, and picked up the club's Player of the Year award. His first senior goal came in a 2\u20131 win against Scarborough in the FA Cup on 15 December.

Cullerton was in fine scoring form, though the promotion campaign fell away and Horton was sold to Brighton for \u00a330,000, which led to a healthy profit on the season. For the club's centenary celebrations a match was held with Stoke City, which finished 1\u20131, an impressive result considering the \"Potters\" were going through one of the most successful periods in their history."]}, {"page": "William Summerscales", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Summerscales"]}, {"page": "William Charles Summerscales", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Summerscales"]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Injuries and suspensions helped to dent the Vale's form, as they lost their status as league leaders. On 17 January, Sproson made his 800th senior appearance in a 2\u20130 victory over Exeter City. In an attempt to lift the club, Lee signed wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. Heading into a six-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Buxton permanently, despite the player's decision to retire at the end of the season. In March, Chairman Arthur McPherson pleaded guilty to receiving stolen goods and so was sentenced to an eighteen-month suspended sentence and fined \u00a31,500. Resigning his position at the club, he was replaced by Mark Singer. On 9 March, the match against Hartlepool had to be suspended for five minutes after Vale fans continually pelted the opposition keeper with snowballs.

On 1 October, Vale beat Wrexham 1\u20130 in an 'ugly' game that saw five players booked and Colin Tartt and opposition player Arfon Griffiths separated by police following a scrap in the tunnel. Later in the month Roy Cross badly injured his knee, and would later have to leave the professional game due to the injury. Vale slipped down the league, and by Christmas they were sixth from bottom, with only John Woodward in good form. Lee then took out striker Keith Leonard on loan from Aston Villa, and bought left-back Neil Griffiths from Chester for a \u00a35,000 fee. He also changed the formation from 4\u20134\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133, hoping to give Brian Horton more room in the centre of the park. After an upturn in form in the new year, Bill Summerscales broke his neck, and Lee departed for the management position at Blackburn Rovers. Lee had been seen to have done an excellent job with little money. In his place club legend Roy Sproson was appointed as caretaker manager, who advocated an 'entertaining' style of play as opposed to battling for every point. Winning his first match 1\u20130 at Shrewsbury Town, he cracked his head on the concrete trainer's box after leaping up to celebrate McLaren's goal. On 17 February, 8,505 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 3\u20131 win over high-flying Bristol Rovers in an experimental Sunday game. Later Leonard returned to Villa Park at the end of his loan deal, and \u00a35,000 was not enough to tempt Villa to part with his services permanently. From mid-March Vale went eleven games without a win, and on 25 March they could have ended this run, but 'a shocking mistake' from Alan Boswell handed Walsall an equalizer as he palmed a header into his own net. The team continued to rack up yellow cards, and following a warning from The Football Association, Sproson arranged for local referee Roy Capey to lecture the players on sportsmanship. In the middle of April, Sproson was given the management job on a permanent basis, despite his team falling to fifth from bottom. Sproson stated that he was 'calculated' and 'controlled', compared to Lee who 'fizzes like a bottle of pop'. By the time they broke their poor run with a 2\u20131 home win over managerless Charlton Athletic, other results had already ensured their safety from the drop.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Bill Summerscales", "|\u2013||DF||||Bill Summerscales||0||1||0||1"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On the financial side, a loss was made of \u00a316,964 despite donations of \u00a313,803 from the development funds.
