In addition to playing professional football at Roker Park, Bingham continued his shipbuilding apprenticeship on the Sunderland shipyards. His speed and ball-control made him a popular player with the \"Black Cats\", and he gradually worked his way into Bill Murray's first team plans in 1950\u201351. He established himself as the first choice outside-right in 1951\u201352, however he lost his place to Tommy Wright in 1952\u201353. He made just 19 appearances in 1953\u201354, as Wright continued to hold on to his first team place. Bingham regained his place in 1954\u201355, scoring ten goals in 42 games, as Sunderland finished fourth in the First Division, four points behind champions Chelsea. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost to Manchester City at Villa Park. They slipped to ninth in 1955\u201356, and again exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals, this time losing 3\u20130 to Birmingham City. The 1956\u201357 campaign started poorly, and Bingham was dropped in October; he put in a transfer request, which was turned down. New boss Alan Brown signed outside-right Amby Fogarty from Glentoran, and led the club to relegation in 1957\u201358. Out of the first team, Bingham fell out with Brown, and left the club in the summer on a \u00a38,000 transfer to top-flight Luton Town. In total he made 227 appearances and scored 47 goals during his time in the North East."]}, {"page": "Tommy Wright", "response": ["Tommy Wright may refer to:", "* Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20132011), Scottish footballer, played for Sunderland", "* Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1944), English footballer who played for Everton", "* Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1963), Northern Ireland footballer", "* Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1966), Scottish footballer who played for Leicester City", "* Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1984), English footballer and manager who has played for Aberdeen, Forest Green Rovers and Darlington", "* Tommy Wright III (born 1976), American rapper and record producer", "* Tommy Wright (actor) (1926\u20131999), appeared in The Elephant Man and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"]}, {"page": "List of Sunderland A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Tommy Wright"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 in Scottish football", "response": ["* 5 May \u2013 Tommy Wright, 83, Partick Thistle, East Fife and Scotland winger."]}, {"page": "Tommy Wright (footballer born 1928)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1928)"]}]}}
