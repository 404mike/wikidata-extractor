Inequalities for strongly singular convolution operators. Acta Math. 124 (1970), 9\u201336.Tomas, Peter A. A restriction theorem for the Fourier transform. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 81 (1975), 477\u2013478.Strichartz, Robert S. Restrictions of Fourier transforms to quadratic surfaces and decay of solutions of wave equations. Duke Math. J. 44 (1977), no. 3, 705\u2013714. Here one studies the operation which restricts input functions on Euclidean space to a submanifold and outputs the product of the Fourier transforms of the corresponding measures. It is of major interest to identify exponents such that this operation is continuous relative to  spaces. Such multilinear problems originated in the 1990s, including in notable work of Jean Bourgain, Sergiu Klainerman, and Matei Machedon.Bourgain, J. Fourier transform restriction phenomena for certain lattice subsets and applications to nonlinear evolution equations. I. Schr\u00f6dinger equations. Geom. Funct. Anal. 3 (1993), no. 2, 107\u2013156Bourgain, J. Fourier transform restriction phenomena for certain lattice subsets and applications to nonlinear evolution equations. II. The KdV-equation. Geom.

In collaboration with Ana Vargas and Luis Vega, Tao made some foundational contributions to the study of the bilinear restriction problem, establishing new exponents and drawing connections to the linear restriction problem. They also found analogous results for the bilinear Kakeya problem which is based upon the X-ray transform instead of the Fourier transform. In 2003, Tao adapted ideas developed by Thomas Wolff for bilinear restriction to conical sets into the setting of restriction to quadratic hypersurfaces.Wolff, Thomas. A sharp bilinear cone restriction estimate. Ann. of Math. (2) 153 (2001), no. 3, 661\u2013698. The multilinear setting for these problems was further developed by Tao in collaboration with Jonathan Bennett and Anthony Carbery; their work was extensively used by Bourgain and Larry Guth in deriving estimates for general oscillatory integral operators.Bourgain, Jean; Guth, Larry. Bounds on oscillatory integral operators based on multilinear estimates. Geom. Funct.
