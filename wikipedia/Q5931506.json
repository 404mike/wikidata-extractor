Many unionists opposed the concept of power-sharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with those (nationalists) who sought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was the unionist opposition to the \"Irish dimension\" and the Council of Ireland, which was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by a young Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, Hugh Logue, to an audience at Trinity College Dublin that Sunningdale was the tool \"by which the Unionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland\" also damaged chances of significant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, Brian Faulkner was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by Harry West, although Faulkner retained his position as Chief Executive in the new government. A UK general election in February 1974 gave the anti-Sunningdale unionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan \"Dublin is only a Sunningdale away\", and the result galvanised their support: they won 11 of the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to nationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists."]}, {"page": "John Hume", "response": ["Hume became a leading figure in the civil rights movement in the late 1960s along with people such as Hugh Logue. Hume was a prominent figure in the Derry Citizens' Action Committee. The DCAC was set up in the wake of 5 October 1968 march through Derry which had caused much attention to be drawn towards the situation in Northern Ireland. The purpose of the DCAC was to make use of the publicity surrounding recent events to bring to light grievances in Derry that had been suppressed by the Unionist Government for years. The DCAC, unlike Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), was aimed specifically at a local campaign, improving the situation in Derry for everyone, and maintaining a peaceful stance.  The committee also had a Stewards Association that was there to prevent any violence at marches or sit-downs."]}, {"page": "Sunningdale Agreement", "response": ["It was eventually agreed that the executive functions of the Council would be limited to \"tourism, conservation, and aspects of animal health\", but this did not reassure the unionists, who saw any influence by the Republic over Northern affairs as a step closer to a united Ireland. They saw their fears confirmed when SDLP councillor Hugh Logue publicly described the Council of Ireland as \"the vehicle that would trundle unionists into a united Ireland\" in a speech at Trinity College, Dublin."]}, {"page": "New Ireland Forum", "response": ["*Hugh Logue"]}, {"page": "Members of the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Hugh Logue", "|Hugh Logue"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention", "response": ["|Hugh Logue", "|Hugh Logue"]}, {"page": "Members of the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Hugh Logue", "|Hugh Logue"]}, {"page": "Londonderry (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=3|Hugh Logue(SDLP)"]}, {"page": "Logue (surname)", "response": ["*Hugh Logue (born 1949), Northern Irish politician and economist"]}]}}
