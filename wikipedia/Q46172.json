The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; prospective candidate Bill Deedes recalled: \"Once she opened her mouth, the rest of us began to look rather second-rate.\" She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate. She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds, but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951. Denis funded his wife's studies for the bar; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation. Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section."]}, {"page": "1915", "response": ["** Sir Denis Thatcher, British businessman, husband of Margaret Thatcher (d. 2003)"]}, {"page": "2003", "response": ["** Denis Thatcher, British businessman and husband of Margaret Thatcher (b. 1915)"]}, {"page": "Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom", "response": ["As with hereditary peerages, baronetcies generally ceased to be granted after the Labour Party came to power in 1964.
