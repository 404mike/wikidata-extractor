Agnes was active in social justice causes including protests against the white slave trade. She signed the 1866 women's suffrage petition and was secretary of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage alongside her stepmother, Priscilla Bright McLaren. In 1873 she travelled with Priscilla and Jane Taylour to give suffrage lectures in Orkney and Shetland.  Her father had supported the campaign of first women who sought to study medicine at University of Edinburgh and Agnes became friends with Sophia Jex-Blake, one of the Edinburgh Seven. Her father did not however, support Agnes' own ambitions in this area. And as she could not graduate in medicine in Scotland, she went to study in France and later, in order to be permitted to practice at home, became a member of the Royal College of Dublin.She was based with the Franciscan Hospital Sisters when in training, and later converted to the Catholic faith in order to carry out missionary work even though Roman Catholic law still prevented its sisters-in-vows from being doctors until 1936.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Agnes McLaren (1837\u20131913), doctor, first to give medical assistance to women in India "]}, {"page": "Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway", "response": ["Born in Edinburgh, McLaren was the son of the politician Duncan McLaren and Priscilla Bright.

She was overjoyed and immediately wrote to McLaren of her interest, and a lively correspondence between them began. McLaren was already in her mid-70s at this time, however, and died before she and Dengel could meet, but Dengel followed the course of preparation for her mission in India which she and McLaren had set. Dengel took McLaren's advice to attend medical school at University College in Cork, Ireland. In 1919, after graduating, she went to England for a nine-month internship. The following year she left for Rawalpindi to continue the work that McLaren had begun.", "The \"First Four\" were unable to profess canonical vows because the Catholic Church had yet to approve the practice of medicine by Religious Sisters, yet they lived as Sisters just the same. Lifting this restriction had been a goal of Dengel's mentor, Agnes McLaren, who had petitioned the Vatican to have Church authorities do so. Finally, in 1936, after the Medical Mission Sisters had grown, the Catholic Church approved Sisters\u2019 working in medicine and all of its branches and recognized the women as a religious congregation, now known as the Sisters of the Catholic Medical Missions. The members of the Medical Mission Sisters then made their first public vows and Sister Anna Dengel was elected the first Superior General.", "*Agnes McLaren"]}]}}
