He had made 18 appearances and scored two goals before the injury ended his season. O'Connor returned to the team in time for the start of the 2012\u201313 season and featured regularly as a substitute. After making 11 appearances, he suffered a serious leg and ankle injury while falling in a tackle in a 1\u20130 victory over Portsmouth on 6 November 2012 and it was determined that he would be out for six months. O'Connor signed a new one-year contract in March 2013. He returned to the first team on 16 April 2013, as a substitute for Lee Hodson after 66 minutes of a pulsating 2\u20132 draw with Sheffield United, a game which saw Tony Craig and Clayton Donaldson sent off for Brentford. Craig's three match suspension began on Brentford's penultimate game of the season against Hartlepool United.

He finished the 2013\u201314 season with 12 appearances and won a Special Achievement Award for reaching 500 appearances."]}]}}
