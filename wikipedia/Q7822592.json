He was an unused substitute for the 1997 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley when Carlisle defeated Colchester United on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw. He also appeared in the famous Jimmy Glass game against Plymouth Argyle, in which the goalkeeper scored in the 94th minute to keep Carlisle United in the Football League.Roddy Collins brought him to Bohemians on loan in August 2000. He made his debut away to UCD soon after signing. Though much maligned during his time at the club, he scored a vital goal in December of that year in a 1\u20130 win over Longford Town. He left the club a month later to return to England. His winner against Longford would prove crucial as Bohemians went on to win the league by 2 points.\nHe also played for Barrow and Workington.\nIn November 2012 he joined Celtic Nation until the end of the season. In January 2017, Hopper was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and he was the guest of honour at Carlisle United's game against Portsmouth.
