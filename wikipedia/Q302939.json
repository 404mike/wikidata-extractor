They supported \"opportunity and aspiration\" being central to the party's programme, with policies supporting the \"security of its people at its heart\".

In 2007, Sheffield, the world's oldest football club was commemorated for reaching its 150th anniversary. In 2008, Michel Platini, then president of UEFA, became the second figure outside the English game to be honoured by the Museum in a one-off European Hall of Fame ceremony. Two years later, Jimmy Hill was honoured with a special lifetime achievement award. In 2013, the special award was used three times. Firstly, to Civil Service, the only surviving club of those represented at the official formation of the Football Association in 1863. Secondly, to Ebenezer Cobb Morley, the first secretary of the Football Association and often considered to be its founding father, inducted to mark the governing body's 150th anniversary. Thirdly, to William McGregor, the founder of the Football League was inducted to commemorate the organisation's 125th anniversary. In 2014, the Football Battalion, a group of professional footballers and fans who fought in the Battle of the Somme, were honoured. In 2015, Sun Jihai, the first Chinese player in the English game, was made \"Anglo-Chinese Football Ambassador\". His surprise induction was announced as part of the state visit to the United Kingdom by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The decision caused controversy on social media with Labour's shadow minister for sport Clive Efford suggesting that the award had been bought by the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. A spokesman for the museum explained that Sun had been recognised for his \"ambassadorial role in enhancing the profile and popularity of English football to a Chinese audience\". In 2016, two clubs were honoured: Cambridge University, for their unofficial claim to be the world's oldest club; some documents in their archive suggest a foundation year of 1856, the year before Sheffield began, and Notts County for their status as the world's oldest club currently playing at a professional level; founded in 1862."]}, {"page": "Southwark College", "response": ["*Clive Efford, Labour MP for Eltham"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Clive Efford, Eltham, 1997\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee", "response": ["|Clive Efford MP"]}, {"page": "Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee", "response": ["| Clive Efford MP (Labour)"]}]}}
