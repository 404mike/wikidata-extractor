Together with music director Mark Elder and stage director David Pountney, they became the ruling \"Power House\" triumvirate that re-invigorated the artistic direction of ENO with a series of modernist interpretations of classic operas as well as productions of newly commissioned operas. That year, David Alden staged a controversial ENO production of Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa that became emblematic of the new era. At the end of Act II when the hero Kochubey and his friend Iskra are dragged to the executioner's block, Alden shocked his audience with a gruesome chainsaw massacre that set the tone for the bloody mad scene in Act III and forever enshrined his production in the minds of London opera goers as \"the Chainsaw Mazeppa\" that \"became a sort of shorthand for the entire Jonas project \u2014 brutal, uncompromising, unmissable, the ultimate succ\u00e8s de scandale.\""]}, {"page": "Mirandolina", "response": ["David Pountney has described the opera as \"the work where Martin\u016f's strain of fast-moving, neo-Classical style comes into its own... finding room for witty and ironic musical references to Italian madrigals, French vaudeville and Italian opera buffa\".'David Pountney.
