As the only amateur in the team who was expected to play regularly, Fender was appointed as captain in Wilkinson's absence.Streeton. p. 69. Years later Fender stated that he had found the situation embarrassing, as he realised there were better qualified professional players who could have been appointed instead. He led the team to victory in his first two matches in charge, and ten of his first twelve games. Wilkinson resumed the leadership at several points during the season, but his return in the final weeks coincided with a poor run of results. He consequently withdrew for two crucial games, and allowed Fender to captain the side.Streeton, pp. 69\u201370. That year Surrey had few effective bowlers; Fender was the leading wicket-taker with 109 wickets in County Championship games.Streeton, p. 71. In all first-class matches he took 124 wickets at an average of 21.40 to reach 100 wickets in a season for the first time. Inconsistent with the bat, particularly in the latter half of the season, he scored 841 runs at 20.51. In almost every match Fender contributed, either with bat, ball or in the field. His captaincy was very effective; his flair, quick-wittedness, and willingness to use unconventional tactics were most unusual at the time. This was rapidly noticed by the public, who appreciated Surrey's entertaining brand of cricket.Streeton, p. 72. Several games were won by Surrey after Fender used unorthodox methods to force the pace.Streeton, pp. 77\u201378. In addition, Fender's batting and bowling performances swayed several games in Surrey's favour.Streeton, pp. 77\u201381. Surrey finished third in the County Championship, but lost their final match, against Middlesex, when a victory would have made them champions.Streeton, pp. 70, 75. Surrey needed 244 to win but Fender's instruction to his batsmen to attempt to score quickly had an adverse effect, and he later blamed himself for the defeat.Streeton, p. 75. Nevertheless, his optimism and inventiveness were appreciated by his team mates and he was appointed permanent captain by the club for the following season.Streeton, p. 81."]}, {"page": "Tom Hayward", "response": ["Despite a gradual decline in his athleticism in his later career, Hayward remained an effective batsman well into his forties, and in June 1913 he scored his hundredth first-class century, becoming only the second batsman (after W. G. Grace) to achieve this feat. He made his 104th and final hundred in August 1914 against Yorkshire at Lord's (where Surrey played several \"home\" matches after World War I had begun), but made just one in his last innings of all, against Gloucestershire back at The Oval and on grounds of age did not resume his career after the end of hostilities. Surrey won the County Championship in his final season. Hayward had the rare honour for a professionalIts rarity is indicated by the fact that when Leicestershire appointed Ewart Astill as their captain for the 1935 season he became the first professional to regularly captain any county during the twentieth century.
