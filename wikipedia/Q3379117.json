As these soldiers were defeated, they were moved west with their families into the Byzantine Empire. The author Ralph Lilley Turner theorised a central Indian origin of Romani followed by a migration to Northwest India as it shares a number of ancient isoglosses with Central Indo-Aryan languages in relation to realization of some sounds of Old Indo-Aryan. This is lent further credence by its sharing exactly the same pattern of northwestern languages such as Kashmiri and Shina through the adoption of oblique enclitic pronouns as person markers. The overall morphology suggests that Romani participated in some of the significant developments leading toward the emergence of New Indo-Aryan languages, thus indicating that the proto-Romani did not leave the Indian subcontinent until late in the second half of the first millennium."]}, {"page": "Thai numerals", "response": ["Ek () is from Pali \u1e17ka, \"one\" Digital Dictionaries of South Asia Sir Ralph Lilley Turner (1888-1983) A Comparative Dictionary of the Indo-Aryan Languages entry 2462 Ek is used for one (quantity); first (rank), more prominent than tho \u0e42\u0e17 second, in tone marks, education degrees and military ranks; and for the lead actor in a role.

The boys on the scheme, termed The Oriental Scholars would study at SOAS in the morning and then return to Dulwich College where they would do more general work.
