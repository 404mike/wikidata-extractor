Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15\u00a0million) tuned into Corrie, and by 1964 the programme had over 20\u00a0million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36\u00a0million viewers.Little (1995). p. 35. In spite of rising popularity with viewers, Coronation Street was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban working class, and its representation of a community that was a nostalgic fantasy. After the first episode in 1960, the Daily Mirror printed: \"The programme is doomed from the outset\u00a0... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.\"Tinker. pp. 12\u201313. By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the 1950s. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) becoming addicted to drugs, Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield) being in a storyline about homosexuality, Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.Little.

Charlie Moffitt (Gordon Rollings) slips on the joists in the loft and puts his foot through the ceiling of Elsie's room. He apologises to the figure in the bed and realises it isn't Elsie.
