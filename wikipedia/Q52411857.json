He is known for his research in social cognition, specifically on social learning, tradition and the evolution of culture, social Machiavellian intelligence, autism and imitation, as well as the behavioral ecology of sociality. In 1996, Whiten and his colleagues invented an artificial fruit that allowed to study learning in apes and humans.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Origin of language", "response": ["While it is possible to imitate the making of tools like those made by early Homo under circumstances of demonstration, research on primate tool cultures show that non-verbal cultures are vulnerable to environmental change. In particular, if the environment in which a skill can be used disappears for a longer period of time than an individual ape's or early human's lifespan, the skill will be lost if the culture is imitative and non-verbal. Chimpanzees, macaques and capuchin monkeys are all known to lose tool techniques under such circumstances. Researchers on primate culture vulnerability therefore argue that since early Homo species as far back as Homo habilis retained their tool cultures despite many climate change cycles at the timescales of centuries to millennia each, these species had sufficiently developed language abilities to verbally describe complete procedures, and therefore grammar and not only two-word \"proto-language\".The multiple roles of cultural transmission experiments in understanding human cultural evolution, Alex Mesoudi, Andrew WhitenChimpanzee Material Culture: Implications for Human Evolution, William Clement McGrew"]}, {"page": "Whitening", "response": ["* Andrew Whiten (born 1948), a British zoologist and psychologist"]}]}}
