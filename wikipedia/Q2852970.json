He was a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, and principal of Cardiff University from 1949 to 1966. Among his publications were a monograph on the reign of Richard II, as well as a biography of the 19th-century writer Robert Smith Surtees, titled Jorrick's England.

One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was Bishop Stubbs. Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign, Richard's mind \"was losing its balance altogether\". Historian Anthony Steel, who wrote a full-scale biography of the king in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that Richard had schizophrenia.Steel (1941), p. 8. This was challenged by V. H. Galbraith, who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis, a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, such as Anthony Goodman and Anthony Tuck. Nigel Saul, who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II, concedes thateven though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illnesshe showed clear signs of a narcissistic personality, and towards the end of his reign \"Richard's grasp on reality was becoming weaker\".Saul (1997), pp. 460\u20134"]}, {"page": "Cardiff University", "response": ["*1949\u20131966 (University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire): Anthony Steel"]}, {"page": "Robert Smith Surtees", "response": ["*Anthony Steel, Jorrocks's England: On the Works of Robert Smith Surtees (London: Methuen & Co., 1932)."]}, {"page": "John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke", "response": ["Pembroke's smaller ships found themselves towered-over by the tall carracks, and Castilian archers rained arrows onto the decks of English ships, whilst well protected by their own wooden breastworks. Pembroke found his fleet caught between the enemy and the sandbanks (located off what later became La Pallice); further, the Castilian ships possessed arbalests, which caused great destruction to wooden decks. Pembroke was unable to replicate the victories of earlier years (for example, at Winchelsea and N\u00e1jera) due to his lack of archers, which would otherwise allowed him to lay down a suppressing fire on the enemy crews. Likewise, Castilian command of the air meant that English soldiers were unable to board Castilian ships. The battle lasted two days. The fighting broke off as night fell on the 22nd; Pembroke had lost two ships, and was now surrounded by the Castilian fleet over night. Fighting recommenced the next morning. Pembroke found his flagship attacked by four of the enemy galleys, who used grappling hooks to attach themselves to the English ship, and later managed to douse the decks of some ships with oil which could then be ignited by fire arrows. Fire, said, Sherborne, played a vital role in the Castilian triumph. Around this point\u2014with horses running wild and kicking holes in the hulls and his men throwing themselves overboard to avoid the flames\u2014Pembroke surrendered, much of his fleet burned or captured. Many of his retinue were killed, and those that survived were also captured. This number included Pembroke himself, as well as the Earl of Huntingdon, and of course, the \u00a312,000 in silver, which was discovered untouched. Historians have since been universally critical of Pembroke's actions at La Rochelle. The Victorian antiquarian J. H. Ramsay described Pembroke's defeat as worst ever inflicted on the English navy, E. F. Jacob, that it was a disastrous blow, and Anthony Steel said that it lost England control of the Channel for several years."]}, {"page": "Anthony Steel", "response": ["Anthony Steel or Tony Steel may refer to:", "*Anthony Steel (actor) (1920\u20132001), British actor", "*Anthony Steel (historian) (1900\u20131973), British historian", "*Anthony Steel (arts leader), active in Australia from 1972"]}, {"page": "Steel (surname)", "response": ["*Anthony Steel (historian) (1900\u20131973), British medieval historian"]}, {"page": "English invasion of Scotland (1385)", "response": ["Richard has generally been considered by historians as being irresponsible for rejecting Gaunt's advice, as the most experienced of his captains. Anthony Steel, though, posits that Richard was probably sensible to reject Gaunt's plan to \"fling himself into the Highlands in a hopeless search for the enemy\". This had, after all, effectively been Gaunt's strategy for his short campaign of the previous year, which had also achieved little of value. \"Gaunt, who had some experience of Scotland\", says Tuck, \"must have appreciated this point\", The King seems to have been particularly concerned for the well-being of the troops. He told Gaunt\u2014according to the Westminster Chronicle\u2014\"though you and the other lords might have plenty of food for yourselves, the rest, the humbler, and lowlier members of our army, would certainly not find such a wealth of victuals as would prevent their dying of hunger\", In the event, no offensive option was taken. The English commanders agreed on a withdrawal, which began around 17 August; before they left, Richard and Gaunt were once again reconciled. The royal army's line of retreat was guarded by Hotspur, who deflected various Scottish flank attacks. Three days later, the King was in Newcastle, and within the fortnight he was back in Westminster. The main army may have taken longer to return.", "Richard's 1385 campaign was considered generally a failure (G. L. Harriss called it \"ignominious\" and May McKisack, \"inglorious\"). Tuck wrote that seen as a \"punitive raid\", it was arguably a success. The Scots were sufficiently persuaded to accept truces for the next three years. This, says Steel, was a far more positive result for the campaign than it has generally been noted: as \"southern Scotland had been wasted so effectively that there was no more danger from the north for another three years\". James Gillespie has highlighted the King's character traits that were to be revealed in 1385. The chevauch\u00e9e, he suggests, indicates \"a headstrong ruler determined to exact vengeance on the Scots\" although the King later made Melrose Abbey a grant towards its rebuilding. Similarly, Richard II's concern for the well-being of the ordinary soldiers is, he says, an early indicator of the \"remarkable concern...that would later endear the King to his Cheshire guard\". It depends on the King's priorities, explains MacDonald. If Richard had a secondary, punitive purpose to the invasion\u2014i.e. punishing the Scots when he could not defeat them\u2014\"and the chronicle accounts provide some corroboration of this\", Tuck, too, has remarked upon Richard's \"unusual sensitivity\" and compares it to a similar sensitivity demonstrated towards the rebelling peasants of 1381. Richard's main problem in the aftermath of the campaign, says Gillespie, was one of the perceptions with which he was held after the campaign. Although it may have been more successful than it appeared at first glance, Richard singularly failed to match up to the image of the successful warrior king as epitomised by his father and grandfather. Some good news came from the Iberian Peninsula, then racked by a civil war over the War of the Castilian Succession. Gaunt had been persuaded by the news of a Castilian defeat that he should enter the dynastic contest, and the following year he led an army to make his claim. His absence from English politics was enough with hindsight, says Anthony Steel, as \"a turning point in Richard's reign\". In March 1386, Richard recognised Gaunt as King of Castille and was probably as keen for Gaunt to go as Gaunt was to be gone. In 2004, Simon Walker wrote, \"Richard was even prepared to speed Gaunt on his way by advancing a loan of 20,000 marks to defray the costs of the expedition\". In 1962, Steel wrote that Gaunt's absence upset the balance of power within the political community and \"liberated forces which had hitherto been more or less under control\"."]}]}}
