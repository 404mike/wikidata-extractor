Judges were appointed by whoever sponsored the show, and were not necessarily rosarians themselves.  The first Grand National specialty rose show was held July 1, 1858, in St. James Hall, London.  It was organized by S. Reynolds Hole, Dean of Rochester Cathedral and a prominent rosarian, Thomas Rivers, a nurseryman and publisher of the first catalog of roses (1834) in the UK, Charles Turner, a rosarian, and William Paul, a writer and nurseryman.  Exhibitors were divided into three classes: nurserymen, amateur rosarians with hired gardeners, and amateur rosarians without hired gardeners (avid exhibitors included many working-class men and farmers).  Prizes were 36 silver cups engraved with roses.  John Edwards was in charge of setting up the show, which entailed clearing away the chairs and benches from the previous night\u2019s concert, and constructing tables for the exhibits.  Subscription fee for exhibitors was 5 pounds, admission for the general public was 1 shilling.  More than 2000 people attended the first Grand National Rose-Show.  Music was provided by a brass band, which proved to be too loud for the venue."]}, {"page": "Thomas Francis Rivers", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Rivers (nurseryman)#Family"]}]}}
