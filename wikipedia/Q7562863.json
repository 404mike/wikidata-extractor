In fact, one, Mike Chaturantabut, would actually later become a Power Ranger, in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue. Noguchi was one of the main stunt coordinators for Power Rangers until the franchise was bought by Disney. Other Masters are tied to Mortal Kombat, Batman & Robin, Shootfighter and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies and series. Hakim Alston (The Machine) made a few appearances in The New Adventures of Robin Hood, playing the role of Kemal, Nomad Warrior. Sophia Crawford (Chameleon) also made an appearance. Clayton Barber, Bridgett Riley, Erik Betts, Mike Chat and Chris Casamassa also appeared in the series Martial Law.

When she went to claim her prize, she found the Dragon Star replaced with red dragon crest of Jukido and screamed in horror, validating Great Wolf's visions.  Wizard, along with Olympus, The Machine, Tiger Claw and Superstar, figured out that Tracer and Warlock were behind the theft, but were convinced there was a third member of the group.  They originally suspected Chameleon of being that third member, but realized that she was innocent; not only was her terror at seeing the Jukido crest instead of the Dragon Star genuine, but Superstar had also previously overheard her reject Tracer's offer to be part of \"the team.\"  Jukido members Tracer and Warlock were definitely part of the plot to steal the Dragon Star, but, unbeknownst to all until the very end (and only to the viewers), so was Hien Nguyen (Tsunami); he brought the Dragon Star to a helicopter, where Tracer and Warlock awaited him.  Great Wolf's visions, however, portrayed Tsunami as a hero who recovers the Dragon Star for the WMAC, so Tsunami's true role in the plot remains a mystery and a topic for debate amongst the fandom."]}, {"page": "Template talk:WikiProject Biography/Missing", "response": ["*Sophia Crawford"]}, {"page": "Inside Kung Fu", "response": ["In 1997, an Inside Kung Fu former columnist received a restraining order for allegedly stalking television actress Sophia Crawford."]}, {"page": "Crawford (name)", "response": ["*Sophia Crawford (born 1966), English actress"]}, {"page": "U.S. Seals II: The Ultimate Force", "response": ["* Sophia Crawford as Sophie"]}, {"page": "Buffering the Vampire Slayer", "response": ["* Sophia Crawford, who was the stunt double for Sarah Michelle Gellar in Seasons 1\u20134 of Buffy "]}]}}
