He married Elizabeth, a daughter of the late Caleb Coffin of New York City on 11 July 1895. They had 3 children, John (1898), Marjorie (1901) and Barbara (1903).\nFranklin contested the Westhoughton Parliamentary division in 1900, and Stretford in 1901, but on both occasions he was unsuccessful. He became Liberal MP for Leicester at a by-election in 1906, however, sharing the representation of the double-member constituency with Ramsay MacDonald. He retired at the January 1910 election.In 1906, Thomasson ventured on a bold but disastrous experiment in newspaper production by founding the Tribune (1906\u20131908).\nHe played a large part in local political life before he left Bolton for London.\nDuring World War I he commanded the 2-5th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment.\nHis wife Elizabeth died in 1927 and he then married Gertrude Prescott. They had three children, Margaret (1930), Christopher (1932) and Jenny (1937).\nFranklin died of cancer on 29 October 1941 aged 68 and was buried at Lyndhurst, Hampshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip Gibbs", "response": ["His first attempt at semi-fiction was published in 1909 as The Street of Adventure, which recounted the story of the official Liberal Party newspaper Tribune, founded in 1906 and failing spectacularly in 1908. The paper was founded at vast expense by Franklin Thomasson, MP for Leicester from 1906-10. A man of decidedly liberal views, Gibbs took an interest in popular movements of the time, including the suffragettes, publishing a book on the British women's suffrage movement in 1910. With tensions growing in Europe in the years immediately preceding 1914, Gibbs repeatedly expressed a belief that war could be avoided between the Entente and Central Powers.  In the event, war broke out in August 1914 and Gibbs secured an early journalistic posting to the Western Front.
