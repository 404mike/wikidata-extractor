He produced a large body of work, consisting of essays, short fiction, and novels, spanning several overlapping genres including horror, fantastic fiction, and science fiction. Hodgson used his experiences at sea to lend authentic detail to his short horror stories, many of which are set on the ocean, including his series of linked tales forming the \"Sargasso Sea Stories\". His novels, such as The House on the Borderland (1908) and The Night Land (1912), feature more cosmic themes, but several of his novels also focus on horrors associated with the sea. Early in his writing career Hodgson dedicated effort to poetry, although few of his poems were published during his lifetime. He also attracted some notice as a photographer and achieved renown as a bodybuilder. He died in World War I at age 40.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Forgotten Futures", "response": ["; Forgotten Futures IV: The Carnacki Cylinders: Horror and the supernatural in Edwardian England, including the original text and illustrations for William Hope Hodgson's \"Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder\", a worldbook with rules for magic and the Ab-natural, three adventures and two long outlines, a story-telling card game, etc."]}, {"page": "1877", "response": ["* November 15 \u2013 William Hope Hodgson, English author (d. 1918)"]}, {"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*William Hope Hodgson (1877\u20131918)"]}, {"page": "Arkham House", "response": ["A second Lovecraft omnibus, Beyond the Wall of Sleep, appeared in 1943 as sales on all Arkham House books continued to advance.

These were Witch House by Evangeline Walton and The Lurker at the Threshold by August Derleth (based on an outline by H. P. Lovecraft).

Weird fiction either eschews or radically reinterprets ghosts, vampires, werewolves, and other traditional antagonists of supernatural horror fiction. Writers on the subject of weird fiction, such as China Mi\u00e9ville, sometimes use \"the tentacle\" to represent this type of writing. The tentacle is a limb-type absent from most of the monsters of European folklore and gothic fiction, but often attached to the monstrous creatures created by weird fiction writers, such as William Hope Hodgson, M. R. James, and H. P. Lovecraft. Weird fiction often attempts to inspire awe as well as fear in response to its fictional creations, causing commentators like Mi\u00e9ville to paraphrase Goethe in saying that weird fiction evokes a sense of the numinous. Although \"weird fiction\" has been chiefly used as a historical description for works through the 1930s, it experienced a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s, under the labels of New Weird and Slipstream, which continues into the 21st century.", "Although the term \"weird fiction\" did not appear until the 20th century, Edgar Allan Poe is often regarded as the pioneering author of weird fiction. Poe was identified by Lovecraft as the first author of a distinct type of supernatural fiction different from traditional Gothic literature, and later commentators on the term have also suggested Poe was the first \"weird fiction\" writer. Sheridan Le Fanu is also seen as an early writer working in the sub-genre. Literary critics in the nineteenth century would sometimes use the term \"weird\" to describe supernatural fiction. For instance, the Scottish Review in an 1859 article praised Poe, E. T. A. Hoffmann and Walter Scott by saying the three writers had the \"power of weird imagination\".Machin, p. 22 The Irish magazine The Freeman's Journal, in an 1898 review of Dracula by Bram Stoker, described the novel as \"wild and weird\" and not Gothic.Machin, p. 14 Weinstock has suggested there was a period of \"Old Weird Fiction\" that lasted from the late 19th to early 20th centuries. S. T. Joshi and Mi\u00e9ville have both argued that there was a period of \"Haute Weird\" between 1880 and 1940, when authors important to Weird Fiction, such as Arthur Machen and Clark Ashton Smith were publishing their work. In the late nineteenth century, there were a number of British writers associated with the Decadent movement who wrote what was later described as weird fiction. These writers included Machen, M. P. Shiel, Count Eric Stenbock, and R. Murray Gilchrist.Machin, p. 78 Other pioneering British weird fiction writers included Algernon Blackwood, William Hope Hodgson, Lord Dunsany,Joshi 1990, p. 42 Arthur Machen,Joshi 1990, p. 12 and M. R. James.Joshi 1990, p. 133 The American pulp magazine Weird Tales published many such stories in the United States from March 1923 to September 1954. The magazine's editor Farnsworth Wright often used the term \"weird fiction\" to describe the type of material that the magazine published.Machin, p. 222-5 The writers who wrote for the magazine Weird Tales are thus closely identified with the weird fiction subgenre, especially H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Fritz Leiber and Robert Bloch.

The language and style used are intended to resemble those of the 17th century, though the prose has features characteristic of no particular period, such as an almost complete lack of dialogue or proper names.

The region's coastal cliffs, ancient ruins and weather conditions influenced Koudelka setting and design.
