It was to be led by Miles Dempsey's British 13th Corps. The plan was that as soon as Dempsey's forces had succeeded in establishing a beachhead they were to push northwards along the coast as quickly as possible, with the goal being to link up with other British forces in the effort to capture the Sicilian coastal towns of Syracuse, Augusta, Catania and airfields around the River Simeto.Bitter Victory: The Battle for Sicily, 1943 by Carlo D'Este, pg. 148 During the fighting in and around Avola between Montgomery's British soldiers and Mussolini's fascist soldiers there was an incident in which around seventy-five American paratroopers landed outside of the town, far away from where the British were already engaged in combat.

They put their helmets on the end of sticks and waved them above the firing line while yelling that they were American. One British soldier exclaimed \"What the bloody 'ell are you Yanks doing 'ere?\" This incident led to the British and Americans making sure that in future operations their forces all used the same password so that they could more easily identify one another in combat.Bitter Victory: The Battle for Sicily, 1943 by Carlo D'Este, pg. 245-246 When the British military's Durham Light Infantry division took over the center of the town they raised their regimental flag over Avola, as soon as the local people recognized that they were the Allies and not more Germans the local people welcomed the British and American soldiers with open arms.Liberating Belsen: Remembering the Soldiers of the Durham Light Infantry By David Lowther pg. 37"]}, {"page": "Kirkman", "response": ["* Sidney Kirkman, British Army general"]}, {"page": "Paul Dean, Baron Dean of Harptree", "response": ["Paul Dean was born in Northwich, Cheshire, England, on 14 September 1924, and was educated at Ellesmere College and Exeter College, Oxford.
