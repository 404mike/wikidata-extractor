Blevins served in both the Legislative Council and House of Assembly. He was a minister in a number of portfolios. In 1983 in a dispute about the use of volunteers in the ambulance service, as minister for Health, he publicly sided with the St. John Council who managed the ambulance service against two unions, the Ambulance Employees Association and the Miscellaneous Workers Association. John Cornwall, reflects that this position probably damaged his credibility at the time, with both unions and the Labor Party. Blevins was Treasurer of South Australia from 1992 to 1993.Prior to entering parliament he was a British merchant seaman and then a merchant seaman at Whyalla. He died at his home in 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 3", "response": ["*1939 \u2013 Frank Blevins, English-Australian lawyer and politician, 7th Deputy Premier of South Australia (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "September 7", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Frank Blevins, English-Australian politician, 7th Deputy Premier of South Australia (b. 1939)"]}, {"page": "Millswood railway station", "response": ["Millswood station closed on 28 April 1995, simultaneously with stations at Clapham and Hawthorn despite criticism from nearby residents, with the conversion of the Adelaide-Wolseley line to standard gauge under the One Nation programme.\"Adelaide's Millswood Station reopens after almost 20 years\", Railway Digest, December 2014, page 18 A number of reasons were quoted as justification for the closures, including poor patronage,Former Minister of Transport Frank Blevins stated there had been consideration since 1966 to close the station because of poor patronage.
