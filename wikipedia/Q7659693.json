He was a regular in the Hatters youth team up until the outbreak of World War I, when he joined the Army and served in the trenches of Northern France. After being gassed in an attack, he was invalided out of the war, and his football career looked in doubt. However, he managed to recover fully and returned to Luton Town after the end of the war, making himself known as a Winger who could play on either flank. Hoar played over 150 league matches for Luton between 1919 and 1924, as they played in the Southern League and later the Third Division South.\nIn late 1924, Hoar joined Arsenal for \u00a33,000, making his debut against Cardiff City on 29 November 1924, and went on to make nineteen appearances that season; he also had trials with England but never made it into the first team. By now, Hoar played more often on the right than the left, but the arrival of Joe Hulme put in 1926 forced him out of the Arsenal first team and he spent most of 1926-27 on the sidelines. However, Hoar forced himself back in the side towards the end of the season, taking over Sam Haden's spot on the left wing. Despite an injury in Arsenal's last game of that season, against Aston Villa, Hoar regained fitness in time to play in the FA Cup Final against Cardiff City; however he had a poor match and Arsenal lost 1-0 after a freak error by goalkeeper Dan Lewis.\nHoar continued to be a regular on the Arsenal left wing for another season, missing only four games in 1927-28 and scoring nine times. But in the close season, Arsenal signed Welsh international Charlie Jones, and Hoar played only six matches in 1928-29. He left Arsenal in September 1929 for Clapton Orient for a fee of \u00a31,000. In all, he played 117 matches for Arsenal and scored 18 goals. Hoar was at Orient for a single season, before retiring in the summer of 1930. He died in 1967, at the age of 71.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sidney Hoar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Syd Hoar"]}, {"page": "1927 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Cardiff City had previously reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup twice, and two years earlier in 1925, they were defeated in the final.Hayes 2003: pp. 15\u201316 Arsenal had never reached a final previously so whoever won would take the trophy for the first time. Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman held a press conference on 21 April where he announced that Horace Cope was injured and would be unable to play at left back. He doubted whether Syd Hoar or Alf Baker would be available as both were still recovering from injury, and so he was leaving the selections for both the right half and outside left positions open should they become fit before the game. He saw Bill Seddon and Sam Haden as the alternatives should his first choice players not recover. When asked about who would win the game, he promised the press an answer after the match. Both Baker and Hoar were eventually named in the Arsenal team. The side trained at the Arsenal Stadium on their own pitch before the final. The players met at Hendon Hall Hotel on the morning of the match but their travel plans were disrupted when they became stuck in heavy traffic. Manager Herbert Chapman was forced to leave the coach to telephone local police for an escort; two motorcycle officers arrived to escort the team to the ground.", "| || Syd Hoar"]}, {"page": "List of English people", "response": ["* Syd Hoar (1895\u20131967), footballer"]}, {"page": "Sid Hoar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Syd Hoar"]}, {"page": "Hoar (surname)", "response": ["* Syd Hoar (1895\u20131967), English footballer"]}]}}
