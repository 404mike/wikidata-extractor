He was also a founder member of the Royal Aero Club. He became a friend of the Wright Brothers, and was one of their main supporters.On 8 October 1908 at Camp d'Auvours, France, 11 Kilometers east of Le Mans, Griffith flew as a passenger with Wilbur Wright. The flight lasted for 4 minutes and 22 seconds. In doing so, he became the first Englishman to go up in an aeroplane. Prior to this, Griffith had been a doubter about the chances of heavier-than-air machines being at all successful for flying. The Wright's also had many other doubters in Europe before those demonstrations in France. But after this flight in 1908, and the demonstrations by them, he became a close friend and supporter of the Wright brothers and made many trips to the United States to visit them. Griffith gained his pilot licence in 1914.He arranged that the British government should get use of the Wright's patents for \u00a315,000 in 1914. This meant that British aircraft manufacturers were free of the threat of litigation.Griffith was President of the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) from 1940 to 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wright brothers", "response": ["On October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, the wife of the brothers' European business agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur \u2013 one of many passengers who rode with him that autumn,\"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Peltier.\" Smithsonian, Retrieved: July 3, 2010. including Griffith Brewer and Charles Rolls.

The tests had no effect on the patent battle, but the Smithsonian made the most of them, honoring the Aerodrome in its museum and publications. The Institution did not reveal the extensive Curtiss modifications, but Orville Wright learned of them from his brother Lorin and a close friend of his and Wilbur's, Griffith Brewer, who both witnessed and photographed some of the tests.Howard 1988, Chapter 46: \"The Aerodrome Affair\"."]}, {"page": "J.
