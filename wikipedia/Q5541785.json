Algernon Fulke Egerton, Lord Ellesmere's third son.  He was then aged 29, and had been educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford; he had been destined for a political life and had no experience of managing coal mines or canals.  Since James Loch had been appointed, he had been mainly in control of the management of the Trustees, assisted by his son George Loch.  During this time the role of Fereday Smith had been diminished; initially appointed as Deputy Superintendent, his position was reduced to that of Principal Agent in 1845.  With the arrival of the inexperienced Algernon Egerton, Fereday Smith had a much greater say in the management.  During the previous four years the Lochs had been reluctant to invest in improvements to the canal or Runcorn Dock, despite the increasing demand for the passage of goods through the dock, and the profits made during these years became stagnant.  Fereday Smith had been keen on expansion and now his opportunity came.  He first reduced the top-heavy administration of the Trust, and then took on the planning of the expansion of the business.  The steamers owned by the Trustees had been neglected and were in a poor state; these were repaired or sold.", "George Loch, who had been opposed to using the Trustees' investments for improvements to the canals or docks, died in 1857. Between 1857 and 1872 the Trustees provided more capital for improvements from their own resources than at any previous time.  The Runcorn and Weston Canal was built in 1858\u201359, providing a connection between Runcorn Docks and the Weaver Navigation.  A new half tide dock, the Alfred Dock was opened at Runcorn in 1860.  Electric telegraph was installed in 1861\u201362."]}, {"page": "Wick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| George Loch"]}, {"page": "Loch (surname)", "response": ["*George Loch of Drylaw (1749-1788), Edinburgh land-owner", "*George Loch (1811\u20131887), Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868\u20131885)", "response": ["|George Loch"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1868 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| George Loch"]}, {"page": "List of office holders of the Duchy of Cornwall", "response": ["* 1873 George LochThe London Gazette, issue 23968, 18 April 1873"]}, {"page": "1887 in Scotland", "response": ["* 18 August \u2013 George Loch, Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Wick (1868\u201372) (born 1811)"]}, {"page": "1872 Wick Burghs by-election", "response": ["The Wick Burghs by-election of 1872 was fought on 28 February 1872.
