While at Carrow Road, he won six full international caps with Northern Ireland.\nNorwich sold Coote to Colchester United for \u00a350,000, but was unable to establish himself in the side, and, after a loan spell at Bristol Rovers where he scored once against Leyton Orient, he was released by Colchester shortly after the start of the 2003\u201304 season.\nSince leaving Layer Road, Coote has played for a series of non-league clubs in Norfolk including Wroxham.\n\nCoote, who is now a sales manager for Brighthouse, said: \"I did have some injury problems. I just fell out of love with football and am now moving on with my life - which is a good life.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrian", "response": ["*Adrian Coote (born 1978), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Bristol Rovers F.C. international players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Adrian Coote||||6||1999\u20132000||2002\u20132003"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland national under-21 football team", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Adrian Coote"]}, {"page": "Coote", "response": ["*Adrian Coote, British footballer"]}, {"page": "Template talk:Infobox football biography/Archive 4", "response": ["Adrian Coote played for Wivenhoe Town (level 8) at the end of his career: stats to be included?"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Adrian Coote"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|15||Adrian Coote||FW|||| Great Yarmouth||||19||4|| Norwich City||21 December 2001||\u00a350,000", "|Adrian Coote", "|align=\"left\"|Adrian Coote"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["Colchester leapt to the top of the Second Division table by the end of August, having beaten Chesterfield 6\u20133 in the opening game of the season, and also knocked out First Division Portsmouth out of the League Cup at Fratton Park.
