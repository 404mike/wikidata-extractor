He is one of a very small group to transfer directly between the Glasgow rivals, having only been at Celtic for only seven months after leaving Queen's Park in June 1905. He made his Rangers debut against Port Glasgow Athletic on 20 January 1906. He was a right back but in later years would convert to a forward. In the 1906\u201307 season, Campbell saw himself being played up front. His very first match in attack, a benefit match versus Morton, saw him score all seven of the goals in a 7\u20130 win. His partnership with Archie Kyle saw him score 13 goals that season. He finished the following two seasons as Rangers' top scorer with 25 and 17 goals respectively but he switched back to defence with the arrival of Willie Reid.\nDuring his Rangers career he made 246 appearances in all competitions and scored 66 goals. He won three Scottish league championships, three Glasgow Cups, three Charity Cups and the Edinburgh Exhibition Cup in 1908.Campbell was selected to play in the Glasgow FA's annual challenge match against Sheffield in 1908, but received no other representative honours. After his retirement he became a director of Rangers in 1926, a position he held until his death in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rangers F.C.", "response": ["| Robert Campbell || 1906\u20131916"]}, {"page": "Old Firm", "response": ["The ferocity of the rivalry has made it rare for a player to represent both teams during his career.
