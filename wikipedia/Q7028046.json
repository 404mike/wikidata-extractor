The journal argued \"Hungary actually needs migrants, even if it doesn't want them\", citing the private sector as suffering from skilled labor shortages. According to The Economist, the referendum would be a \"challenge to the authority of Brussels and the leadership of Germany's Angela Merkel, who champions the relocation scheme\". Nick Thorpe, Budapest correspondent of BBC News explained the main purpose of the referendum is that Orb\u00e1n \"wants to play a bigger role on the European stage, as a \u00abchampion of the concerns of ordinary Europeans\u00bb against the actions of \u00aban unelected, liberal elite\u00bb, as interpreted by the premier himself. Thorpe argued there will be only \"political\" consequences of the referendum, with Visegr\u00e1d Four, an alternative power block may arise on the basis of \"Europe of Nations\" concept against the mainstream federal vision represented primarily by France and Germany. In the case of an unsuccessful plebiscite, Orb\u00e1n \"will look weak, even foolish\", he added. Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative said Orb\u00e1n, with the tool of referendum, sought to launch a \"cultural counter-revolution\" within EU which will lead to the \"end of liberal Europe\"."]}, {"page": "Lume Books", "response": ["Lume Books is an independent publishing company based in London.
