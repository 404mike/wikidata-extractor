The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes\u2014or loves\u2014on worlds they have visited.

Romana's progressive policies, including opening the Academy to non-Gallifreyans, also face opposition from more conservative elements. Complicating this is the escape of an ancient evil called Pandora from the Matrix in the paradoxical form of Romana's first incarnation (played once again by Mary Tamm). Both Romana and the Pandora entity proclaim themselves Imperiatrix of Gallifrey, provoking a civil war. At the war's end, Romana destroys Pandora by trapping her in the Matrix and destroying it. She is also removed from the Presidency.  With Gallifrey on the brink of economic and social collapse, as well as in danger of being overrun by a Free Time virus, Romana and her friends flee through several alternate universes.  Romana encounters many versions of Gallifrey worse than her own, before finally becoming trapped in one.  This Gallifrey is similar, but without the ability to time travel.  After their President Romana is assassinated, she assumes her identity, regaining her office, albeit in a different universe. She is eventually able to return to her universe with a cure for the Free Time virus, although the audios then lead into early strikes by the Daleks that are apparently intended to foreshadow the Time War.", "In July 2013 it was announced that Juliet Landau would play a future incarnation of Romana for Big Finish.

This version of Romana was later reprised by Landau in the January 2014 audio drama Luna Romana, part of Big Finish's Companion Chronicles line; Landau also performs the role of Romana I in lieu of the now-deceased Mary Tamm in this story, the narrative intending to present Landau's Romana as looking back on the events of her first incarnation's travels with the Doctor. To avoid confusion with her earlier self, this future Romana volunteers to use the name Lady Trey (taken from one of the middle syllables of her full name). Landau returned to the role once again in Gallifrey: Intervention Earth, a continuation of the Gallifrey series released in January 2015. This story is revealed in the follow-up Enemy Lines to depict what happens shortly after Ward\u2019s incarnation is forced to regenerate and sees Gallifrey on the brink of another war.
