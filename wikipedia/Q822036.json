They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey.", "Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London (UCL) in September 1996. The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz. Guy Berryman, a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs. Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying classics at the University of Oxford, to be the band's manager. Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group. The band's line-up was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience). Initially, the band rehearsed in Jonny Buckland's bedroom in a flat, with neighbours who were able to tolerate the noise.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  The band finally settled on the name \"Coldplay\", which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group.", "Bassist Guy Berryman once explained that the band often have a title and concept in mind before the music arrives, which serves to provide a \"framework into which we can work thematically\". During an interview for YouTube in 2019, lead vocalist Chris Martin described their way of making songs as \"a series of doors\" where he usually brings initial ideas to guitarist Jonny Buckland, who either disapprove them or give his input. The same happens from Buckland to Berryman and then drummer Will Champion, allowing all band members to express themselves artistically. This process, however, is known to not always be linear, given how tracks like \"Magic\" and \"Adventure of a Lifetime\" started through the bass and guitar riffs from Berryman and Buckland respectively.", "* Will Champion \u2013 drums, backing vocals, keyboards, piano, guitar, tin whistle, percussion"]}, {"page": "Avedis Zildjian Company", "response": ["* Will Champion of Coldplay"]}]}}
