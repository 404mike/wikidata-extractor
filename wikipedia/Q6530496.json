Stepanova wrote in her 1925 course plan that this was done \"with the goal of devising methods for a conscious awareness of the demands imposed on us by new social conditions\".Christina Kiaer, Imagine no Possessions \u2013 the Socialist Objects of Russian Constructivism, MIT Press, 2005, Page 122,  Lyubov Popova was also a member of the textile faculty, and in 1922, when hired to design fabrics for the First State Textile Print Factory, Popova and Stepanova were among the first women designers in the Soviet textile industry.Abbott Gleason, Peter Kenez, Richard Stites, Bolshevik Culture: Experiment and Order in the Russian Revolution, Indiana University Press, 1985, Pages 209\u2013210,  Popova designed textiles both with asymmetrical architectonic geometries, and also work that was thematic. Before her death in 1924, Popova produced fabrics with grids of printed hammers and sickles, which would predate work by others in the political climate of the first five-year plan.Lesley Jackson, Twentieth-Century Pattern Design: Textile & Wallpaper Pioneers, Princeton Architectural Press, 2002, Page 55, "]}, {"page": "Maija Isola", "response": ["Lesley Jackson, in a chapter titled Op, Pop, and Psychedelia, writes that \"from Finland the exuberant all-conquering Marimekko burst on to the international scene\" in the 1960s; she illustrates this with one pattern by Vuokko Nurmesniemi, and three by Isola \u2013 Lokki, Melooni, and inevitably Unikko."]}, {"page": "Mary White (textile designer)", "response": ["Examples of White's designs are held by several British museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Warner Textile Archive in Essex and the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester.
