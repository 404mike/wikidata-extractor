Playing at full-back, he spent his entire professional career at Chelsea.\nBorn in Glasgow, he signed for David Calderhead's Chelsea from local junior club Bridgeton Waverley and made his Football League debut in 1926 against Bradford City. He soon established himself as Chelsea's first choice full-back, a position he would hold for most of his time at Stamford Bridge and was one of the less glamorous, though more reliable, members of a star-studded Chelsea squad which included his Scottish teammates, Hughie Gallacher, Alex Jackson, Willie Ferguson and Andy Wilson. He made 318 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 19 goals, mainly from penalties.Law won two caps for Scotland, both against England. He made his debut during Scotland's famous \"Wembley Wizards\" 5\u20131 win over England at Wembley in 1928. His final cap came in the same fixture two years later, though this time the Scots lost 2\u20135.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andrew Wilson (footballer, born 1896)", "response": ["He made 253 appearances for Chelsea and scored 52 goals in the next eight years.

Led by 24 goal striker Jack Cock, the club's latest glamour signing, they finished third in the league \u2013 then the highest league finish for a London club \u2013 and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, only to be denied by eventual winners Aston Villa, which saw them miss out on a chance to play in the final at Stamford Bridge. The club were relegated again in 1923\u201324 and in four of the next five seasons were to narrowly miss out on promotion, finishing fifth, third, fourth and third. With long serving mainstays including Willie Ferguson, Tommy Law and Andy Wilson, Chelsea finally reached the First Division again in 1929\u201330, where the club was to remain for the next 32 years.", "Calderhead stepped down in 1933 and was replaced by Leslie Knighton, but the appointment saw little change in Chelsea's fortunes. At different times during the decade the club had on its books such players as Tommy Law, Sam Weaver, Sid Bishop, Harry Burgess, Dick Spence and Joe Bambrick, all established internationals, yet their highest league finish in the decade was eighth. Ironically, two of the club's most reliable players during the decade cost them nothing: goalkeeper Vic Woodley, who was to win 19 consecutive caps for England, and centre-forward George Mills, the first player to score 100 league goals for Chelsea. They avoided relegation by two points in 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334, and by one point in 1938\u201339. Another promising cup run in 1939, which included wins over Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday, petered out with a home loss to Grimsby Town in the quarter-finals.", "Following the war, Chelsea again spent big, and again bought three big-name forwards, this time Tommy Lawton, Len Goulden and Tommy Walker, for around \u00a322,000. The trio provided both goals and entertainment \u2013 Lawton set a new club record by scoring 26 goals in 34 league games in 1946\u201347 \u2013 but Chelsea finished 15th that season and never finished above 13th under Birrell. After a falling out with Birrell, Lawton was sold to Notts County for \u00a320,000; his replacement was Roy Bentley, signed from Newcastle United for \u00a311,500 in 1948."]}, {"page": "Alex Jackson (footballer, born 1905)", "response": ["Jackson signed for David Calderhead's big-spending Chelsea in September 1930 for \u00a38,500, joining international teammates Hughie Gallacher, Tommy Law and Alec Cheyne already at the club. His time at Chelsea was hampered by injuries, though he linked up well with the prolific Gallacher and himself scored 31 goals from 78 games for the club. Jackson's first-class career was then ended prematurely during the 1932\u201333 season. Having already fallen foul of the Chelsea hierarchy for activities relating to the public house he operated, he and several other star players at the club were approached by French side N\u00eemes with a lucrative contract offer, which Jackson threatened to accept unless Chelsea broke their maximum wage structure and increased his salary. The club refused to budge and, in the days before the Bosman ruling, Jackson could do little. He was forced to finish his career playing for a series of non-league clubs such as Ashton National (from Ashton-under-Lyne) and Margate. He later joined French side Nice."]}, {"page": "Wembley Wizards", "response": ["|FB ||3 ||Tommy Law (Chelsea)"]}, {"page": "Chelsea F.C.
