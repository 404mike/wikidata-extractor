From 1880 onwards, the club's first-choice colours consisted of light blue shirts and white shorts. One Olympic player, James Ward, was selected for the England team and six other former or future England internationals played for the club, including Jack Hunter, who was the club's coach at the time of Olympic's FA Cup win.", "Before the final, former England player Jack Hunter, who had joined the club in 1882 in the twin roles of player and coach, arranged to take the team to Blackpool for several days' special training.  Such an undertaking had never before been made by a club, and it was considered an extremely novel idea.Warsop, p. 7", "In the south, however, Olympic's victory over one of the great amateur teams provoked consternation.  At the time, The Football Association (the FA), the sport's governing body, prohibited clubs from paying their players.  Despite this, working-class clubs, especially those based in Lancashire, had been widely suspected of making illicit payments to players since at least 1876.Davies, p. 36 In the wake of Olympic's high-profile victory, journalists and officials affiliated with southern amateur clubs intensified their calls for the FA to investigate the finances of northern clubs. They focussed in particular on Olympic's training excursion to Blackpool, suggesting that the players would not have been able to take so much time off work unless the club was paying them some form of wage.  Questions were also asked about players who had relocated from one town to another seemingly for the sole purpose of playing for a new football team.  In Olympic's case Jack Hunter had moved from Sheffield to join the club.Phythian, p. 54 Ultimately no action was taken against Olympic, although punishments were imposed on other clubs, including Preston North End, who were expelled from the FA Cup.  This in turn prompted the northern clubs to make plans to break away from the FA and form a rival governing body which would not impose the so-called \"amateur ideal\" on clubs.Davies, p. 38", "|Half-backs || Thomas Gibson, Jack Hunter, William Astley", "James Ward was the only player to be selected for the England team while on the books of the club.Phythian, p. 120 He won one cap, against Wales in 1885. Tommy Dewhurst was originally chosen for an international match in 1884, but was deselected after he was involved in a fight with an opposition player during a match between Olympic and Northwich Victoria.Phythian, p. 59 Six other Olympic players represented England either before or after their time with the club: Joe Beverley, Edgar Chadwick, Jack Hunter, Jack Southworth, William Townley and John Yates.", "The concept of a football manager did not exist in the 19th century, although some modern sources identify Jack Hunter as having been the team's manager. Hunter's main responsibility was for the coaching of the players, although in the club's later years he also took charge of seeking out and signing promising amateur players.Phythian, p. 74 The club's benefactor, Sydney Yates, held the post of president and his brother Fred served as chairman of the club's committee.  The majority of the administration of the club was handled by the secretary, a post held for most of the club's existence by Bill Bramham.Phythian, p. 67"]}]}}
