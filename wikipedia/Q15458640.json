The inspiration for this came when Playboy asked Thompson (and many other music industry figures) in 1999 for their suggestions for the \"top ten songs of the millennium\".  Guessing that Playboy expected most people's lists to start at around 1950, Thompson took the magazine at its word and presented a list of songs from the 11th century to the present day. Perhaps not surprisingly, Playboy did not use his list, but the exercise gave him the idea for a show which takes a chronological trip through popular music across the ages.  Thompson acknowledges that this is an ambitious undertaking, partly because he reckons that he is technically unqualified to sing 98% of the material,Liner notes to 1000 Years Of Popular Music CD .

I Did It Again\".", "In 2009, Thompson was commissioned to write a piece for the International Society of Bassists in honour of Danny Thompson.
