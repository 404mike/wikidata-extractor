As a painter he worked chiefly in watercolour, on portraits and on animal, landscape, legendary and religious subjects. He was also a wood-engraver and painter of inscriptions. In 1965, Kenneth Clark took him to be the best living British painter, while both T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden considered his poetry among the best written in the 20th century. Jones's work gains form from his Christian faith and Welsh heritage.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
