Chriss Mann of Resident Advisor stated that Box of Dub worked well as an introduction to dubstep, while finding that \"the emphasis is on the dub roots of the scene rather than trying to cover all the possible ground. For this reason Digital Mystiks, Haze, Scuba and Skream appear with two tracks, while some of the pioneers and innovators such as Horsepower Productions, Benga and Shackelton are conspicuous by their absence.\" Killian Fox of The Observer called the album a \"superb dubstep selection\" declaring it an \"essential record for initiates and devotees alike.\" finding the highlights to be Burial, Kode 9, and Skream. Spin gave the album a three and a half star rating out of five, stating that that \"dubstep hasn't caught on [in the United States]\" while noting that tracks by \"Burial, Kode 9 or the almighty Skream through fat speakers at high volume, and they'll melt your sacrum like bikram yoga.\""]}]}}
