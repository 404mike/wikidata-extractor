Playing for Becontree Athletic on Sunday mornings, Walker was spotted by a club scout and given a trial. He played for the club in the London Midweek League, but moved to west London club Park Royal for the following season.After a home clash against Park Royal, West Ham re-signed the player and he made his first-team debut as right-half against Burnley on 27 August 1934. After featuring in a number of defensive positions, he finally settled into centre-half as replacement for Jim Barrett in 1936.During World War II, Walker served with an infantry battalion  who fought from El Alamein to Italy and was several times mentioned in dispatches. He played football for the Army whilst on duty in the Middle East and also took leave to play games for West Ham. Upon his return from action, he took the captaincy and played league football with the club until his final game on 18 February 1953, against Plymouth Argyle at Upton Park. He totalled 292 league appearances for the club, scoring two goals.\nThe following four years would see Walker play more than 200 further reserve and A team games until the end of the 1956\u201357 season, when his playing contract was not renewed by Ted Fenton.
