After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding peer pressure. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board Blue Midget being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to Red Dwarf."]}, {"page": "Cat (Red Dwarf)", "response": ["In \"The Beginning\" (2012), the Cat deduces that Rimmer's long-dead father (Simon Treves) is continuing to haunt him, preventing Rimmer from coming up with a plan to battle a simulant fleet.

This proves that Rimmer no longer cares what his father has to say, and is free of this \"demon\" inside of him messing up his head, leading to a successful attack devised by Rimmer which defeats the simulants."]}, {"page": "Uncle Dynamite", "response": ["The story was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in six parts in 1994.
