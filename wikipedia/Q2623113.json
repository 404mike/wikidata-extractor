He was Charles Anthon Professor Emeritus of the Latin Language and Literature at Columbia University, New York.  He was one of the leading scholars of the literature and history of the later Roman world and at the same time a wide-ranging classical philologist whose work encompassed above all the Greek and Latin poetic tradition from Hellenistic to Byzantine times but also aspects of late antique art.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Theodosius I", "response": ["From the time Edward Gibbon wrote his Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, Ambrose' action after the fact has been cited as an example of the church's dominance over the state in Antiquity. Alan Cameron says \"the assumption is so widespread it would be superfluous to cite authorities. But there is not a shred of evidence for Ambrose exerting any such influence over Theodosius\". Brown says Ambrose was just one among many advisors, and Cameron says there is no evidence Theodosius favored him above anyone else."]}, {"page": "Callimachus", "response": ["During the 280s, Callimachus is thought to have studied under the philosopher Praxiphanes and the grammarian Hermocrates at Alexandria, an important centre of Greek culture. He appears to have experienced a period of relative poverty while working as a schoolteacher in the suburbs of the city. The truthfulness of this claim is disputed by the classicist Alan Cameron who describes it as \"almost certainly outright fiction\". Callimachus then entered into the patronage of the Ptolemies, the Greek ruling dynasty of Egypt, and was employed at the Library of Alexandria. According to the Suda, his career coincided with the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who became sole ruler of Egypt in 283 BC. Classicist John Ferguson puts the latest date of Callimachus's establishment at the imperial court at 270 BC."]}, {"page": "Historia Augusta", "response": ["Other opinions included Dr H Stern's, who postulated that the History was composed by a team of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of Magnentius on behalf of the senatorial aristocracy who had supported the usurper.

None include forced conversion. The ancient Christians rarely committed violence against persons. They wanted to see themselves, and to have others see them, as \"pious, peaceful and law-abiding citizens\". According to Alan Cameron, most violence committed by Christians was against property, was unofficial, perpetrated primarily by monks and radicals, and done without the support of Christian clergy or state magistrates. Salzman says pagans were more likely to commit violence against persons with the support of municipal elites. There are only a few examples of Christian officials having any involvement in the destruction of pagan shrines. In the 380s, one eastern official (sometimes identified as the praetorian prefect Cynegius), used the army under his control and bands of monks to destroy temples in the eastern provinces. ", "In Markus' reading of events, this shift marked a 'colonization' by Christians of the pagan empire and pagan values. There is a mass of material on the continuation of the circuses, amphitheatres and games on into the sixth century, but Alan Cameron explains this by saying art and culture of the late fourth century had removed its pagan elements (i.e. sacrifice) and become secularized. Late Antiquity witnessed the \"vigorous flowering of a public culture that Christians and non-Christians alike could share\"; the two religious traditions co-existed and tolerated each other \u2013 in social practice \u2013 throughout most of the period."]}, {"page": "Consular diptych", "response": ["In Late Antiquity, a consular diptych was a type of diptych intended as a de-luxe commemorative object. The diptychs were generally in ivory, wood or metal and decorated with rich relief sculpture. A consular diptych was commissioned by a consul ordinarius  to mark his entry to that post, and was distributed as a commemorative reward to those who had supported his candidature or might support him in the future.p178.

Later, the letter might be written on papyrus and presented within the covers. By the late fourth century, however, specially-commissioned diptychs began to be included among the gifts that appointees to high office distributed to celebrate and publicize the public games that were their principal duties.p. 182.

These diptychs were made of ivory, with relief carvings on the outside chosen by the donor, looking superficially similar to codicils but containing no writing and with no official status.pp. 185\u2013194.

Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, for example, distributed some to commemorate his son's quaestorian games in 393 and praetorian games in 401 respectively. Almost all depict the games, and on three separate occasions Symmachus links the presentation of these diptychs with the completion of the games.p. 182 of: The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs.

Alan Cameron observes that this dominating influence is \"often spoken of as though documented fact\". Indeed, he says, \"the assumption is so widespread it would be superfluous to cite authorities\".", "Archaeologists Luke Lavan and Michael Mulryan point out that the traditional catastrophic view is largely based on literary sources, most of which are Christian, and are therefore known to exaggerate. Christian historians wrote vividly dramatized accounts of pious bishops doing battle with temple demons, and much of the framework for understanding this age is based on the \u201ctabloid-like\u201d accounts of the destruction of the Serapeum of Alexandria, the murder of Hypatia, and the publication of the Theodosian law code.Brown, Peter. Late antiquity. Harvard University Press, 1998Cameron, Averil. Christianity and the Rhetoric of Empire: The Development of Christian Discourse. United Kingdom, University of California Press, 1994. Lavan and Mulryan indicate that archaeological evidence of religious conflict exists, but not to the degree or the intensity to which it was previously thought, putting the traditional catastrophic view of \"Christian triumphalism\" in doubt. Rita Lizzi Testa, Professor of Roman history, Michele Renee Salzman, and Marianne S\u00e1ghy quote Alan Cameron as saying that the idea that religious conflict is the cause of the swift demise of paganism is pure historiographical construction.Pagans and Christians in Late Antique Rome: Conflict, Competition, and Coexistence in the Fourth Century.
