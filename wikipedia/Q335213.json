Others\u2014most notably David Gross but also Lubos Motl, Peter Woit, and Lee Smolin\u2014argue that this is not predictive. Max Tegmark,Tegmark (1998) op. cit. Mario Livio, and Martin Rees argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable and/or testable for the theory to be accepted, and that many well-accepted theories are far from completely testable at present.", "Carter  has frequently regretted his own choice of the word \"anthropic\", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general.e.g. Carter (2004) op. cit. Otherse.g. message from Martin Rees presented at the Kavli-CERCA conference (see video in External links) have criticised the word \"principle\" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of selection effects."]}, {"page": "Inflation (cosmology)", "response": ["A period of inflation that occurs below the temperature where magnetic monopoles can be produced would offer a possible resolution of this problem: monopoles would be separated from each other as the Universe around them expands, potentially lowering their observed density by many orders of magnitude. Though, as cosmologist Martin Rees has written, \"Skeptics about exotic physics might not be hugely impressed by a theoretical argument to explain the absence of particles that are themselves only hypothetical.

The effect was predicted before it was observed by Martin Rees and can be explained as an optical illusion caused by the object partly moving in the direction of the observer,"]}, {"page": "Transhumanism", "response": ["In his 2003 book Our Final Hour, British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress. However, Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity. Instead, he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness. Advocates of the precautionary principle, such as many in the environmental movement, also favor slow, careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas. Some precautionists believe that artificial intelligence and robotics present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life."]}, {"page": "The Third Culture", "response": ["* theoretical astrophysicist Martin Rees"]}, {"page": "Trinity College, Cambridge", "response": ["In 2011, the John Templeton Foundation awarded Trinity College's Master, the astrophysicist Martin Rees, its controversial million-pound Templeton Prize, for \"affirming life's spiritual dimension\".", "Six Masters subsequent to Rab Butler had been Fellows of the College prior to becoming Master (Honorary Fellow in the case of Martin Rees), the last of these being Sir Gregory Winter, appointed on 2 October 2012.

May appeared on the 700th episode of The Sky at Night hosted by Sir Patrick Moore, along with Chris Lintott, Jon Culshaw, Professor Brian Cox, and the Astronomer Royal Martin Rees who on departing the panel, told Brian May, who was joining it, \"I don't know a scientist who looks as much like Isaac Newton as you do.\" May was also a guest on the first episode of the third series of the BBC's Stargazing Live, on 8 January 2013."]}, {"page": "Royal Observatory, Greenwich", "response": ["The Astronomer Royal Martin Rees called PPARC \"irresponsible\" for how it handled the RGO."]}, {"page": "Extinction", "response": ["Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on nature and nurture. The question of whether more extinctions in the fossil record have been caused by evolution or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of Modeling Extinction, argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions. By contrast, conservation biology uses the extinction vortex model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about human extinction have been raised, for example in Sir Martin Rees' 2003 book Our Final Hour, those concerns lie with the effects of climate change or technological disaster."]}, {"page": "John Polkinghorne", "response": ["After two years in Scotland, he returned to teach at Cambridge in 1958. He was promoted to reader in 1965, and in 1968 was offered a professorship in mathematical physics, a position he held until 1979, his students including Brian Josephson and Martin Rees. For 25 years, he worked on theories about elementary particles, played a role in the discovery of the quark, and researched the analytic and high-energy properties of Feynman integrals and the foundations of S-matrix theory. While employed by Cambridge, he also spent time at Princeton, Berkeley, Stanford, and at CERN in Geneva.

However, when addressed as a peer, Lord, Lady or Baroness is followed by the name of his or her barony, not his personal name. This is relevant when a baron or baroness's title is completely different from his or her personal surname (e.g. William Thomson, Lord Kelvin), or includes a territorial designation in addition to his surname (e.g. Martin Rees, Lord Rees of Ludlow). This also means that including a baron or baroness's forename before his or her title is incorrect and potentially misleading. For example, \"Lady Margaret Thatcher\" (as opposed to \"Lady Thatcher\") would imply that she was the daughter of an earl, marquess or duke, or Lady of the Garter or Thistle not holding a peerage rather than a baroness. Likewise, in the case of men, \"Lord Digby Jones\" (as opposed to \"Lord Jones of Birmingham\") would imply that he was the younger son of a marquess or duke rather than a baron."]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| Martin Rees || UK || 1942 ||", "*Martin Rees (UK, 1942\u2013)"]}, {"page": "Sandra Faber", "response": ["Around 1984, Faber collaborated with Joel Primack, George Blumenthal, and Martin Rees to elucidate their theory of how dark matter was part of galaxy formation and evolution.

While some details have been proven wrong, the paper still stands as the current working paradigm for structure information in the universe. She and her collaborators discovered high-speed galaxy flows."]}, {"page": "Cold dark matter", "response": ["A review article in 1984 by Blumenthal, Sandra Moore Faber, Primack, and Martin Rees developed the details of the theory."]}]}}
