There was of course sadness as seven players died fighting in the war.  These were goalkeeper Richard Herron, half-backs Henry Hargreaves and Stan Ripley and reserve team players George Limer, Jack Shorthouse, Tom Kinson and Bill Nixon. Stoke's exploits in the War-League not only brought prestige and standing, but also swelled the coffers to the extent of financial stability. It was hoped that the club was set from a bright future and, with virtually everyone retained who had acquitted themselves so well in the war period, promotion was the target. Two Scottish players George Jarvis (from Celtic) and Jock Stirling (from Bradford Park Avenue) joined the forward ranks, whilst goalkeeper Tom Kay became first choice keeper and would go on to make 70 successive appearances."]}, {"page": "William John Nixon", "response": ["#redirectBill Nixon"]}, {"page": "William Nixon", "response": ["* Bill Nixon (William John Nixon, 1886\u20131916), English footballer"]}]}}
