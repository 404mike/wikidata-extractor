Viral interference refers to the inhibition of virus growth caused by previous exposure of cells to an active or a heat-inactivated virus. Isaacs and Lindenmann were working with a system that involved the inhibition of the growth of live influenza virus in chicken embryo chorioallantoic membranes by heat-inactivated influenza virus. Their experiments revealed that this interference was mediated by a protein released by cells in the heat-inactivated influenza virus-treated membranes. They published their results in 1957 naming the antiviral factor they had discovered interferon. The findings of Isaacs and Lindenmann have been widely confirmed and corroborated in the literature."]}, {"page": "Macfarlane Burnet", "response": ["Under Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\".

The first description of IFNs as a cellular agent interfering with viral replication was made by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann in 1957. The history of this finding was recently reviewed. There are 3 types of IFNs: Interferon type I, Interferon type II and Interferon type III. The type II IFN, also called IFN\u03b3, is produced by specific cells of the immune system. Unlike type I and type III IFNs, IFN\u03b3 has only a modest role in directly restricting viral infections. Type I and type III IFNs act similarly.
