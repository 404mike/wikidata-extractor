A club cricketer and Minor Counties player for Cheshire before World War II, and a major during the war, he was asked to captain Lancashire in the first season after the war. Despite his inexperience and his negligible batting ability he was a popular captain who led the side to third position in the County Championship with 15 victories in 26 matches.\nWisden's report of the Lancashire season noted that \"under J.A. Fallows the old stigmas of dullness and lack of imagination were overcome. Whatever his limitations as a batsman, the new captain proved shrewd in the field and inspiring everywhere. Willingness to go out for victory and keen finishes ensured maximum interest and enjoyment.\" In 2012, assessing the role of the amateur captain in county cricket, Colin Shindler praised Fallows as the archetypal amateur captain: \n\nWhen only four fresh eggs were available one morning at a London hotel, he awarded them to the bowlers because Lancashire were likely to be fielding all day. His team respected and liked him, and he did exactly what an amateur should: he declared boldly to give the opposition a chance and his bowlers time to take their wickets. The crowds returned to Old Trafford, and the team were slightly unlucky to finish only third.\nDespite his success, Fallows was replaced as county captain for 1947 by Ken Cranston. He served on the Somerset committee before returning to Lancashire, where he was elected to the committee in 1964. As chairman of the Cricket Subcommittee he helped the county overcome a period of failure to achieve success under the captaincy of Jack Bond in the late 1960s and 1970s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["When play began in 1946, after World War II, things started badly for Lancashire when the captain and veteran player, Jack Iddon, was killed in a car accident just before the start of the season. Jack Fallows stood in as captain for the season. His successor, Ken Cranston, was an unusual choice as he had no prior first-class experience; despite this his captaincy was not unsuccessful as Lancashire finished third and fifth during his two years in charge. In 1947 Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place both scored over 2,500\u00a0runs and scored 19\u00a0centuries between them. Washbrook's benefit took place in August 1948 and was watched by 50,000 people; he received \u00a314,000 (\u00a3 in ), beating the previous record by over \u00a310,000. Despite finishing 11th in 1949, in 1950\u00a0\u2013 under the captaincy of Nigel Howard\u00a0\u2013 Lancashire shared the county championship with Surrey, winning 16 matches; Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton claimed nearly 300\u00a0wickets between them. The 1950 season marked the emergence of Brian Statham. In the following three seasons, Lancashire finished third each time.

He was an all-rounder who bowled fast-medium and batted in the middle of the batting order. He made his first-class debut on 14 May as captain of Lancashire, in the match against Oxford University. He was immediately successful in first-class cricket, and made his Test cricket debut in the Third Test against South Africa at Old Trafford on 5 July, less than eight weeks after his first-class debut. In the Fourth Test at Headingley, he took four wickets in six balls (w.w.ww) to end the South African second innings."]}, {"page": "John Fallows (cricketer)", "response": ["#redirectJack Fallows"]}, {"page": "List of Lancashire County Cricket Club captains", "response": ["* Jack Fallows 1946"]}]}}
