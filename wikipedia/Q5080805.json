He was born in Belfast.\nMcCullough was based on the Shankill Road.  He was a member of the founding executive of Ulster Protestant Action, in 1956.  He was elected to Belfast City Council for the group in 1958, topping the poll.  He left the group before the next elections, in 1961, joining the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP).Cullough secured re-election under his new party colours and, by 1965, he was the chair of its Improvement Committee.  He resigned from this following a dispute over the naming of the Queen Elizabeth Bridge; he had instead hoped it would be named for Edward Carson, and believed that this name had been rejected due to party indiscipline.In 1968, McCullough was elected to the Senate of Northern Ireland.  He resigned from the UUP in September 1970, and became a founder member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) the following year.   The Senate ceased to meet in 1972, and, although McCullough remained a supporter of the DUP, he did not stand in any further elections. On 4 October 2014, he died at the age of 90.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ulster Protestant Action", "response": ["The initial executive of the UPA consisted of John McQuade, Billy Spence, Charles McCullough, Richard Fenton, Frank Millar, Sammy Verner, Herbert Ditty, Bob Newman and Noel Doherty, with Paisley as an ex officio member.Ed Moloney and Andrew Pollak, Paisley, p.82", "Although initially opposed to professional politicians, specifically banning them from membership of the group, the UPA stood the former Belfast City Councillor and superintendent of an independent gospel mission, Albert Duff, against Brian Maginess in Iveagh at the 1958 Northern Ireland general election.Clifford Smyth, Ian Paisley: Voice of Protestant Ulster, p.9  Maginess was perceived as being sympathetic to Catholics, having banned an Orange Order parade in 1952,\"Maginess, (William) Brian\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and Duff was able to take 41.5% of the vote, although he failed to win the seat.
