The festival attracted soloists with national or \u2013 increasingly \u2013 European profiles, with performers in the late 18th century including the sopranos Charlotte Brent, Gertrud Elisabeth Mara and Elizabeth Billington; the instrumentalists Wilhelm Cramer, Giacobbe Cervetto, John Crosdill, John Mahon and Robert Lindley;  and the conductors Thomas Greatorex, William Crotch and Samuel Wesley. By 1790 the Birmingham Festival had expanded to occupy the Royal Hotel as well as the New Street Theatre and St Philip's and had become a major meeting point for the aristocracy of the English Midlands, being attended by the Earl of Aylesford, the Earl of Warwick, Viscount Dudley and Ward, Sir Robert Lawley and the High Sheriff of Warwickshire among others. Receipts from the festivals increased steadily, and by 1805 the sum donated to the hospital was \"by far the largest sum ever raised that way outside the metropolis\""]}, {"page": "John Mahone", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Mahon (composer)"]}, {"page": "John Mahoon", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Mahon (composer)"]}]}}
