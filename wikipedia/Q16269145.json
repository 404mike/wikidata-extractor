He joined Oxford Brookes University in 1998 as Research Professor in the History of Medicine. From 1978 until 1998 he was at the Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine at the University of Oxford. Following graduation from the University of Oxford, he completed an MA and PhD at University College London.His father Emmerich Weindling was one of the forty Austrians allowed to study dental surgery in Britain in 1939, and had requalified at Guy's Hospital. His mother Erica (n\u00e9e Gutmann) had come to Britain age 17 in 1939 on a Kindertransport,  staying in Highgate with A.V.Hill. She too became a dentist. They became British citizens in 1949 and made their home in Highgate. Paul Weindling was educated at Highgate School where Hill had been a Governor.In 2014 he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernst Haeckel", "response": ["In 1906 Haeckel belonged to the founders of the Monist League (Deutscher Monistenbund), which took a stance against philosophical materialism and promote a \"natural Weltanschauung\".Andreas W.

In a 1948 letter to Carl Zietlow, a Minnesotan Protestant pastor of the NCCJ, Muench described the organization as unneeded because: \"regarding anti-Semitism\" he had \"found very little of it\". Historian Paul Weindling has described Muench as having \"made efforts to downplay war crimes by distrusting Holocaust survivors as exaggerating Nazi crimes\", part of a broader worldview that stated that \"Germans were victims: Jews, Slavs and communists were exaggerating crimes against them to extricate resources\".Weindling, 2008, 485."]}, {"page": "Robert Remak", "response": ["According to historian Paul Weindling, Rudolf Virchow, one of the founders of modern cell theory, plagiarized the notion that all cells come from pre-existing cells from Remak.

He then confirmed that the phenomenon existed in the cell of every frog's egg immediately after fertilization, proving that this was a universal phenomenon and finally explaining the reason for the results of tests by Louis Pasteur which had previously proved that there exists no spontaneous generation of life."]}, {"page": "Philipp Schwartz", "response": ["From 1953 he worked as a pathologist at the Warren State Hospital in Pennsylvania and chaired a research department there.
