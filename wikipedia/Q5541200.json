The battalion then entrained with a strength of 18 officers and 750 other ranks (ORs) under the command of Lt-Col George Cockerill (CO since 30 March) for its war station at Falmouth, Cornwall. Here it carried out the dual tasks of garrison duty and preparing reinforcement drafts of regular reservists, special reservists, recruits and returning wounded for the regular battalions serving overseas. It probably assisted in the formation of 16th (Reserve) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, at Falmouth from Kitchener's Army volunteers on 2 October 1914. During this period Lt-Col Cockerill was transferred to a post in Military Intelligence and Maj R.S.I. Hesketh was promoted to take over command.James, p. 49.Royal Fusiliers at Long, Long Trail.O'Neil, p. 9.O'Neil, pp. 361\u20132.London Gazette, 3 April 1914.", "* Lt-Col George Cockerill, retired major, appointed 30 March 1914"]}]}}
