In 1768 he was in Damon and Phillida, and The Padlock.For Bannister's English opera firsts, see Margaret Ross Griffel, Operas in English: A Dictionary Revised Edition (Scarecrow Press, 2012), p. 901 Read here.  In 1774 he was the original Tom Tug in Dibdin's lasting work, The Waterman, at its first presentation at the Haymarket.G.H. Davidson, The Songs of Charles Dibdin with a memoir by George Hogarth, 2 vols (G.H. Davidson, London 1848), I, pp. xx, xxxiii, 44\u201345. He appeared in the first production of The Cobbler, and in 1777 was the first Mr. Steady in The Quaker at Drury Lane.The British Drama: A Collection of the Most Esteemed Tragedies, Comedies, Operas, and Farces, in the English Language. In Two Volumes, (Jones & Co., London 1824), Vol. 1, p. 233. 'Steady, in The Quaker, has never, except in him, found an adequate representative.'Adolphus 1839, Vol. 2, p. 124. There is a portrait of him in this role, see engraving by William Ridley after a painting by Pye, Published London 1804 in the Folger Shakespeare Library View here. He was in the premiere of The Chelsea Pensioner in 1779, and was Sergeant (opposite Charles Dibdin as Countryman, and Mrs Wrighten as Wife) in Dibdin and Isaac Bickerstaffe's musical entertainment of The Recruiting Serjeant at the Royalty Theatre in 1789.The British Drama, 1824, p. 210. As Tom Tug, Mr Steady and the Recruiting Serjeant he was succeeded (at Covent Garden) by Charles Incledon, and by Charles Dignum, who were his friends, and adopted them for tenor voice instead of bass or baritone.", "He and William Shield, Charles Incledon, Charles Dignum, 'Jack' Johnstone, Charles Ashley and William Parke (oboeist) in 1793 formed themselves into 'The Glee Club', a set which met on Sunday evenings during the season at the Garrick's Head Coffee House in Bow Street, once a fortnight, for singing among themselves and dining together. A project to erect a bust to Dr Thomas Arne, which this group proposed to fund by charitable performances, was vetoed by the management of Covent Garden.W.

Linley collaborated with his son Thomas in penning the comic opera The Duenna, with libretto by his son-in-law Richard Brinsley Sheridan.", "The early years of marriage saw Linley as the sole income producer for the family; some of the older children, particularly Elizabeth and Mary, were sent to stay with relatives, or perhaps boarding school. Linley was a tenor, an organist and harpsichordist but at that time was generating his income mainly by teaching and his tuition skills were increasingly sought out; Frances Sheridan was one of his pupils in 1763, although she became better known as a playwright and novelist. Another of his pupils was Anna Maria Crouch who later stated she was apprehensive of him. Charles Dignum was also trained by Linley."]}, {"page": "Charles Incledon", "response": ["His friendship and professional involvement with William Shield, from his first days at Covent Garden, set the character of his career. He and Shield, Charles Bannister, Charles Dignum, 'Jack' Johnstone, Charles Ashley and William Parke in 1793 formed themselves into 'The Glee Club', a set which met on Sunday evenings during the season at the Garrick's Head Coffee House in Bow Street, once a fortnight, for singing among themselves and dining together.W. Parke, Musical memoirs (1830), pp. 175\u201379. Many of Shield's songs were either written for him or were sung by him, with the composer's high approval. Shield said of him that, not only did Incledon's interpretation of the songs he had written for him never disappoint his expectation, but that he often brought a grace, beauty and charm to them which the composer had not imagined to be present in his own work, and that a large share of the popularity of those songs might be credited to Incledon's unrivalled excellence in singing them. Many songs were written for him also by George Baker (1773\u20131847), the composer and organist of Stafford and Derby, who had been a fellow-pupil of Incledon's under Jackson at Exeter.W.H. Husk, 'Baker, George, Mus. Bac.' in J.A. Fuller Maitland (Ed.), Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Vol. I (Macmillan & Co., London 1922), pp. 167\u201368.", "Of these friends, Charles Dignum was the singer whose range and repertoire most nearly resembled his own. Like him, Dignum took Dibdin roles such as The Waterman. It was said of Incledon that he gave to everything his own reading, and though he had rivals, his own distinctive style and character never had any true successors. He was master of a certain declamatory recitation style exemplified by The Storm by G.A. Stevens, a stentorian ballad of near-shipwreck requiring much range of volume and vocal colour, his performance of which assisted his success at Portsmouth in 1793, caused Mrs Siddons to sob like a child, and astonished John Kemble at that great actor's retirement dinner.S. Baring-Gould, Cornish Characters (1908), pp. 377\u201380, citing William Robson, The Old Playgoer (1846). His background in the naval sea-song genre, and experience of seafaring, no doubt coloured his delivery and gave it authenticity, just as he never lost his Cornish accent."]}, {"page": "The Pirates (opera)", "response": ["|Genariello ||tenor|| Charles Dignum"]}, {"page": "No Song, No Supper", "response": ["|George Crop, father of Louisa, brother-in-law of Robin ||tenor|| Charles Dignum"]}, {"page": "Dido, Queen of Carthage (opera)", "response": ["*Abdalla \u2013 created by Charles Dignum"]}, {"page": "John Henry Johnstone", "response": ["Johnstone and William Shield, Charles Incledon, Charles Dignum, Charles Bannister, Charles Ashley and William Parke (oboeist) in 1793 formed themselves into 'The Glee Club', a set which met on Sunday evenings during the season at the Garrick's Head Coffee House in Bow Street, once a fortnight, for singing among themselves and dining together.
