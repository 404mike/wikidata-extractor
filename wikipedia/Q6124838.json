In the later Short Trip \"All Hands on Deck\", Susan decides to leave her life on Earth and join the Time War, with the box set Susan's War depicting her service in the War. She helps the Time Lords form an alliance with the Sensorites to gain the aid of their telepathic circuits- also recruiting Ian to act as a diplomat in the process- (\"Sphere of Influence\") and later missions including capturing a Dalek agent on Florana (\"The Uncertain Shore\") and preventing a plan to configure the vortex-dwelling Orovix as a weapon against the Daleks as Susan recognised that they were too dangerous (\"Assets of War\"). She was briefly manipulated by a Dalek agent to go back to 1963 to try and help them retrieve the Hand of Omega before the Hand could be used to destroy Skaro, but she and the Eighth Doctor are able to trick the Daleks into taking a fake Hand without alerting the Renegade Daleks of that era to the presence of the Time War Daleks (\"The Shoreditch Intervention\")."]}, {"page": "List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs", "response": ["Alex is the Doctor's great-grandson (the son of Susan Campbell) and features in the Eighth Doctor adventures.
