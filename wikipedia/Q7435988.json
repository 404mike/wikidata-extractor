Torquay had finished seventh in the league, and had beaten fourth placed Shrewsbury Town by a 2\u20130 aggregate scoreline in the semi-final on their way to the final. The final was hosted at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium due to the UEFA Champions League 2011 final being held at Wembley Stadium.

The Torquay defence proved as resilient against the Championship side as it had been against every other team it had encountered since the beginning of April, and it was not until the very last minute of extra time that Royals striker Grzegorz Rasiak finally found a way past keeper Scott Bevan.  A similar problem was encountered by Bournemouth in their Johnstone Paints Trophy First Round clash with the Gulls.  However, this time, with the match going straight to penalties with a 0\u20130 stalemate after 90 minutes, the Cherries still could not find a way past Bevan and Torquay went on to win the tie 3\u20130 in the penalty shoot out.", "With over 5,000 supporters struggling to get through the Plainmoor turnstiles for the match with Crawley, there was a fifteen-minute delay to the kick off to what turned out to be an ill-tempered Fourth Round tie.  Torquay found it hard to get a foothold in the first half of the game and eventually fell behind in the 39th minute to a Matt Tubbs strike.  However, worse was to follow in the second period when Chris Zebroski was sent off in the 61st minute for a second bookable offence after a handball in the six yard box.  However, when keeper Scott Bevan managed to save the resulting penalty from Tubbs, the Gulls spirits were raised again until another penalty was awarded to Crawley just minutes later.  Astonishingly, Bevan pulled off his second penalty save of the match, this time from Craig McAllister, to give Torquay another lifeline.  Unfortunately, they were unable to capitalise on Bevan's heroics and, despite the sending off of Dean Howell for Crawley in the 83rd minute, the score remained 1\u20130 until the final whistle.  In a match which saw seven bookings in addition to the two dismissals, many Torquay supporters were angered by the tactics employed by Crawley manager Steve Evans (two of Crawley's yellow cards were for time wasting) and their misery was compounded the following day when Evans\u2019 men were rewarded with a trip to Old Trafford to play Manchester United in the Fifth Round draw.", "With Torquay now having to wait for a decision on any punishment from the FA, the club had to make the most of a busy February schedule which included a further six League Two encounters following the disastrous Hereford game.  The first three were against teams battling relegation and the Gulls took full advantage, grabbing maximum points against struggling Stockport, Barnet and Burton Albion.  These matches saw Paul Buckle begin to experiment with his squad selection with second choice keeper Danny Potter being brought in to give Scott Bevan a well-deserved break and left back Lathaniel Rowe-Turner deputising for the ever-present Kevin Nicholson.  Both players rewarded the manager's faith with Potter keeping clean sheets in his first three games and Rowe-Turner scoring on his first league start of the season against Barnet.  With loan players Jake Robinson and Craig Stanley fitting seamlessly into the new-look squad, Torquay were further enhanced by another loan signing in Northampton midfielder Ryan Gilligan.", "Top of Ling's list of priorities was to start building a new team.  With players reaching the end of their contracts and loan players returning to their parent clubs, the squad was now starting to look rather threadbare.  Several key players who had got Torquay to the play-off final would definitely not be at the club for the new season.  Player of the year, Guy Branston made a move to Bradford City while Scott Bevan decided to join Paul Buckle at Bristol Rovers.  Torquay fans were also disappointed to see midfielder Craig Stanley, who had been particularly impressive for the Gulls on his loan spell from Morecambe, also follow Buckle to the Memorial Stadium.

However, Vauxhall were level ten minutes into the second-half, scoring three quick-fire goals of their own. The home side then took the advantage once again through substitute Luke Reynolds.

Six minutes into the second-half, Stevenage halved the deficit, Morison headed the ball down to Mitchell Cole, who produced a neat right-footed finish to beat Scott Bevan in the Kidderminster goal.

Stimson brought on Craig Dobson in place of Steve Guppy after 63 minutes, and ten minutes later, Dobson levelled the scores at two-apiece. Dobson latched on to a \"hopeful long punt\" from John Nutter and toe poked the ball past onrushing Bevan. Kidderminster responded by making an instant change, bringing on Andrew White for Iyseden Christie. However, it was Stevenage who would go on to complete a remarkable comeback with just two minutes of the game remaining.
