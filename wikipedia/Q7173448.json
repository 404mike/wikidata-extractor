He was the original director of ITV's successful police drama, The Bill, and made a substantial contribution to the series thereafter. He also served as Head of Series for BBC television drama between 1989 and 1993, which included cancelling Doctor Who after its 26th season and several years of poor viewing figures.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doctor Who", "response": ["The BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on BBC 1. Due to his increasingly poor health, the first actor to play the Doctor, William Hartnell, was replaced by the younger Patrick Troughton in 1966. In 1970, Jon Pertwee replaced Troughton and the series at that point moved from black and white to colour. In 1974, Tom Baker was cast as the Doctor. His eccentric style of dress and quirky personality became hugely popular, with viewing figures for the show returning to a level not seen since the height of \"Dalekmania\" a decade earlier. In 1981, after a record seven years in the role, Baker was replaced by Peter Davison, at 29 by far the youngest actor to be cast as the character in the series' first run and, in 1984, Colin Baker replaced Davison. In 1985, the channel's controller Michael Grade attempted to cancel the series, but this became an 18-month hiatus instead. He also had Colin Baker removed from the starring role in 1986. The role was recast with Sylvester McCoy, but falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production ended in 1989 by Peter Cregeen, the BBC's new head of series. Although it was effectively cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th season, which would have been broadcast in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed, over several years, that the series would return."]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Peter Cregeen"]}, {"page": "Barefoot in the Park", "response": ["A revival production toured the United Kingdom in 2012.

Woodentop followed Police Constable Jim Carver (Mark Wingett) on his first day, mentored by Woman Police Constable June Ackland (Trudie Goodwin). The production was seen as innovative for the use of natural lighting, hand-held cameras and an authentic portrayal of British policing.

Meanwhile, the owners of the set of Sun Hill Police Station set in Barlby Road - where production moved in 1987 after the News International protests at the original Wapping site disrupted filming - decided to renovate the building. This caused Thames Television to look for a new area to host the filming of the police station and selected a disused hospital in Clapham, but this did not go ahead. Instead, Thames settled for an old wine warehouse in Merton industrial estate, near Wimbledon, South London. The move was accounted for by a station fire in 1990 that killed off PC Ken Melvin, who was the first confirmed main character death on the series since it began; however, PC Pete Ramsey was presumed dead after he was shot in his final episode - Don't Like Mondays - a year earlier."]}, {"page": "Mike Gibbon", "response": ["He directed and produced the BBC televised soap opera, EastEnders.

According to the writer David Yallop, acting ability was a key factor in deciding which members of the cast to kill off.

With Tom Baker not averse to appearing should conditions be met, serious thought was given to an original production and there was a meeting in June 1992 to discuss the concept of the special; by 21 July 1992 writer Adrian Rigelsford (later joined by Joanna McCaul) had completed an initial outline for the story entitled Timeflyers. Shortly afterwards the project was given the cover name The Environment Roadshow. A production office was opened for the project in the first week of September 1992 with shooting planned for January\u2013February 1993.

Harper was contracted as the director of the special in June 1993 and intended Rik Mayall to play the part of the villain, Hawkspur.

The return proved to be a ratings success, though Kemp has since been sceptical about the possibility of another return.
