Critics have since referred to the use of this shifting timeline in films as the \"Tarantino Effect\". Actor Steve Buscemi has described Tarantino's novel style of filmmaking as \"bursting with energy\" and \"focused\".

The modern Hollywood blockbuster is the most popular film format from the 1980s. Producer Don Simpson is usually credited with the creation of the high-concept picture of the modern Hollywood blockbuster. In the mid 1980s, a wave of British directors, including Ridley Scott, Alan Parker, Adrian Lyne and Tony Scott (with the latter directing a number of Don Simpson films) ushered in a new era of blockbusters using the crowd-pleasing skills they had honed in UK television commercials."]}, {"page": "1944", "response": ["** Tony Scott, English film director (d. 2012)"]}, {"page": "Albert Finney", "response": ["Finney then made Gumshoe (1971), the first feature directed by Stephen Frears, for Memorial.
