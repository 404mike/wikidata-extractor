In 1740 William Stukeley notes, \"Pendulous rocks are now called henges in Yorkshire\u00a0... I doubt not, Stonehenge in Saxon signifies the hanging stones.\" Christopher Chippindale's Stonehenge Complete gives the derivation of the name Stonehenge as coming from the Old English words st\u0101n meaning \"stone\", and either hencg meaning \"hinge\" (because the stone lintels hinge on the upright stones) or hen(c)en meaning \"to hang\" or \"gallows\" or \"instrument of torture\" (though elsewhere in his book, Chippindale cites the \"suspended stones\" etymology).", "In 1958 the stones were restored again, when three of the standing sarsens were re-erected and set in concrete bases. The last restoration was carried out in 1963 after stone 23 of the Sarsen Circle fell over. It was again re-erected, and the opportunity was taken to concrete three more stones. Later archaeologists, including Christopher Chippindale of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge and Brian Edwards of the University of the West of England, campaigned to give the public more knowledge of the various restorations and in 2004 English Heritage included pictures of the work in progress in its book Stonehenge: A History in Photographs."]}, {"page": "Processual archaeology", "response": ["Writing in 1987, the archaeologist Christopher Chippindale of Cambridge University spoke on the view of processualism at that time, putting it in the context of the 1960s, when he stated that:"]}, {"page": "Ronald Hutton", "response": ["* Christopher Chippindale, Review of The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles, History Today, (1992)"]}, {"page": "Sedbergh School", "response": ["*Christopher Chippindale, Stonehenge archaeologist"]}, {"page": "1983 in archaeology", "response": ["* Christopher Chippindale - Stonehenge Complete."]}, {"page": "Christopher Chippendale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Chippindale"]}, {"page": "Antiquity (journal)", "response": ["* Christopher Chippindale (1987\u20131997)"]}, {"page": "David Gibbins", "response": ["* Gibbins, David and Christopher Chippindale (editors), 1990. \"Maritime archaeology.\" Antiquity 64 (243), pp.\u00a0334\u2013400.", "* Gibbins, David and Christopher Chippindale, 1990. \"Heritage at sea: proposals for the better protection of British archaeological sites underwater\".

The following year, Jones and Roberts returned to the site with archaeologist Mike Smith and excavated another test-pit adjacent to that of Kamminga.
