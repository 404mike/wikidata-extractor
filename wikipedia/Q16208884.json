In 1997 The Guardian published some of his work and approached him to write a fictional column about student life (intended as a parody of Bridget Jones's Diary) and soon 'Neil Docking's Diary' \u2013 a semi-satirical portrait of university life \u2013 appeared in the newspaper. In spite of some complaints about the portrayal of students, Docking was nominated for Feature Writer of the Year at the Guardian/NUS Media Awards in 1997.\nFollowing graduation, Docking moved briefly into music journalism before penning a short film script, Without a Song or a Dance (which he later also scored) intended to be considered by Elton John's newly established Rocket Pictures. It was rejected but was eventually produced by BBC Wales (dir. Maxine Evans). The film opened the door for further script writing work first on the BBC Radio serial Station Road and then on the television series Nuts and Bolts for ITV1 Wales. He later worked as a writer, script doctor, storyliner and story editor on such long running British television shows such as Crossroads, Emmerdale (ITV) and Casualty (BBC). In 2012 he wrote the screenplay and music score for an independent feature film musical Summertime (retitled 'Rain'), directed by Maxine Evans.\nIn 2001, Neil Docking was shortlisted for the Dennis Potter Screenwriting Award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maxine Evans", "response": ["Evans's production of The Revlon Girl written by Neil Docking won Best New Play the Off West End Awards and was nominated for Outstanding Achievement at the Olivier Awards in 2018.", "Maxine met her husband Neil Docking while still at Youth Theatre in South Wales.
