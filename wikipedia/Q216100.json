The award was particularly controversial as many did not consider Jethro Tull hard rock, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no one from the band attended the award ceremony. In response to the criticism they received over the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying amid a pile of iron and the line, \"the flute is a heavy metal instrument\", with the word \"heavy\" inserted into the sentence as though a later addition. In response to an interview question about the controversy, Ian Anderson quipped, \"Well, we do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.\" In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly, and ranked #1 in EW's 2017 listing of Grammy upsets. In 1992, when Metallica finally won the Grammy in the category, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich joked, \"First thing we're going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year\", a play on a Grammy comment by Paul Simon some years before thanking Stevie Wonder for the same thing.", "The style of Crest of a Knave (1987) has been compared to that of Dire Straits, in part because Anderson no longer seemed to have the vocal range he once possessed and preferred to use the lower registers, while Martin Barre's guitar sound apparently drifted towards Mark Knopfler's style. Two songs in particular\u2014\"Farm on the Freeway\" and \"Steel Monkey\"\u2014got heavy radio airplay. The album also contained the popular live song \"Budapest\", which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. Although \"Budapest\" was the longest song on that album (at just over ten minutes), \"Mountain Men\" became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of El Alamein and the Falkland Islands, drawing historical parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt: ", "Prior to the recording of 1995's Roots to Branches album, longstanding bass player Dave Pegg left the band, wishing to concentrate on Fairport Convention and not being keen on the world-music direction the band chose. Doane Perry (returning as the band's full-time drummer) recruited his friend and widely respected session bass player Steve Bailey to fill the gap: Ian Anderson, in turn, relinquished control of the rhythm section arrangements on that record, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry. Despite his studio contributions, however, Bailey did not join the band, and Pegg's formal replacement as Jethro Tull bassist was Jonathan Noyce.", "2003 saw the release of The Jethro Tull Christmas Album, a collection of traditional Christmas songs together with old and new Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull.

In the following year The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull, a 24-song set of Tull's and Ian Anderson's acoustic performances taken from various albums, was released. Included are a new live acoustic version of \"One Brown Mouse\" and a live performance of the traditional song (attributed to Henry VIII), \"Pastime with Good Company\".", "During interviews in November 2011, Martin Barre stated that there were no current plans for future Jethro Tull work. In 2012, Barre assembled and toured with a group, billed as Martin Barre's New Day, which included Jonathan Noyce that played mostly Tull material. In 2015, Barre stated \"It's important that people realize there will never be a Jethro Tull again. There will be two solo bands: the Ian Anderson Band and the Martin Barre Band, and long may they exist, and long may they enjoy playing music. I'm not being pedantic.

Rush's Geddy Lee, for example, said about Jethro Tull: \"I was a massive Tull fan from very young\u00a0... and, I hope, that too reflects in Rush. I was mesmerised by Ian Anderson.

He rejected this, thinking it was simply a collection of songs, so in response decided to \"come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums\". Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.

Before recording sessions for the album began, the band's original guitarist Mick Abrahams departed the band as a result of musical differences with frontman and primary songwriter Ian Anderson; Abrahams wanted to stay with the blues rock sound of their 1968 debut, This Was, while Anderson wished to add other musical influences such as folk rock.", "Jethro Tull released their debut album This Was in October 1968.

Anderson estimated that he wrote \"50 percent\" of Stand Up during the summer of 1968. Anderson wrote the album's songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedsit in Kentish Town, London, and cited Roy Harper, Ornette Coleman, Charlie Parker, Bert Jansch, Pentangle, Blind Faith and Jimi Hendrix as inspirations. The new material's departure from the band's blues-based style caused conflict with guitarist Mick Abrahams, who was a blues purist: Anderson recalled \"running some of [the new songs] by Mick Abrahams, and coming to the conclusion that they weren't going up to be up his street at all\" while drummer Clive Bunker stated that \"when Ian started to write new and different stuff, that's when we realised we were going to have serious problems, because Mick just didn't want to do it.\" The stylistic clash resulted in Abrahams' departure from the band in December 1968. The band initially began rehearsals for Stand Up with Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, however Iommi left the band after only a few weeks as he felt he did not fit in well with the group.
