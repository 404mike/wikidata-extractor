From 2015 until 2019, he was head of the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division of the University of Oxford and a Professor of Engineering Science and Physics at Jesus College, Oxford. From 2006 to 2015, he was the Lee-Lucas Professor of Experimental Physics at Imperial College London. He was the founding director of the Centre for Plastic Electronics and served as vice-provost for research at the college.\nBradley is known for his contributions to the development of molecular electronic materials and devices. Plastic or printed electronics, as this technology is widely known, embodies a paradigm shift towards low temperature, solution-based device fabrication with applications in energy efficient displays and lighting, photovoltaic energy generation, medical diagnostics and longer term potential for optical communications.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "European Latsis Prize", "response": ["|Donal Bradleyhttp://www.esf.org/esf_pressarea_page.php?section=6&language=0&newsrelease=97"]}, {"page": "Royal Society Bakerian Medal", "response": ["*2010 Donal Bradley, Plastic electronics: their science and applications"]}, {"page": "Wimbledon College", "response": ["* Donal Bradley, molecular electronic devices and applications \u2013 director of the centre for plastic electronics at Imperial College LondonCentre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, retrieved 18 September 2015."]}, {"page": "Institute of Physics Michael Faraday Medal and Prize", "response": ["* 2009 Donal Bradley, \"For his pioneering work in the field of 'plastic electronics'\""]}, {"page": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford", "response": ["* Donal Bradley, pioneer in molecular electronic materials"]}, {"page": "Daniel Joseph Bradley", "response": ["He married Winefride O'Connor and had five children: daughter Mairead and sons Sean, Donal Bradley, Martin and Ronan."]}]}}
