Although never a big money-spinner, it remained in the repertoire until the company closed in 1982.

In 2000, Oxford University Press published a scholarly edition of the score and libretto, edited by Sullivan scholar David Russell Hulme.  This restores the work as far as possible to the state in which its authors left it and includes a substantial introduction that explains many of the changes, with appendices containing some music deleted early in the run.

A 1987 recording by the New Sadler's Wells Opera, for which David Russell Hulme was adviser, restored most of the surviving material from the first-night version, including \"For thirty-five years I've been sober and wary\", as well as the extra music from the ghost scene. The recording and the production were based in part on Hulme's research, which also led to the 2000 Oxford University Press edition of the Ruddigore score, in which the music for some passages was published for the first time.", "Ruddigore was not revived professionally during the authors' lifetimes. When it received its first professional revival in December 1920 in Glasgow \u2013 and then in London, in October 1921 \u2013 the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a number of further cuts and changes that were incorporated in scores and used in subsequent D'Oyly Carte productions and recordings.Some of the cuts and changes seen in most modern scores may have been made after that date.  Two recordings from the period, in 1924 and 1931, do not agree on a musical text, which suggests that the changes were not made all at once. David Russell Hulme, editor of the Oxford University Press 2000 scholarly edition of the score, has attributed the cuts and other changes to the music principally to Harry Norris, musical director of the D'Oyly Carte at the time of the Glasgow revival, and the modifications to the opera's orchestration, as well as the new overture, to Geoffrey Toye.  He concluded that some lesser changes may have been made by Malcolm Sargent, but in a few cases Hulme was uncertain as to which conductor was responsible for which change.

The Sullivan scholar David Russell Hulme noted Sullivan's parody of operatic styles, \"particularly the Handelian recitatives and the elopement scene (evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies), but best of all is the travesty of the patriotic tune in 'For he is an Englishman!'\"Hulme, quoted in Sadie, vol. 2, p. 727 Buttercup's Act II song, in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby-switching is preceded by a quote from Franz Schubert's \"Erlk\u00f6nig\" and also parodies the opera Il trovatore. Jacobs notes that Sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in \"Donizettian recitative\". But on the serious side, he enhances the moments of true emotional climax, as in Josephine's Act II aria, and added musical interest to concerted numbers by \"subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings.\""]}, {"page": "Edward German", "response": ["The music scholar David Russell Hulme wrote of German that French influences are clearly apparent in his music \"and there are even occasional reminders of Tchaikovsky, but paradoxically he was, like Elgar, a stylistic cosmopolitan who wrote music that is quintessentially English.\" Hulme also observes that though he is seen as Sullivan's successor, German's music is quite different in style, and his lyric ballads especially show \"a romantic warmth that struck a new note in British operetta\". The Times argued that German was so frequently spoken of as Sullivan's successor that his contemporaries failed to notice that he was \"an artist of genius\" in his own right.The Times obituary, 12 November 1936, p. 16 Many of German's colleagues in the musical establishment did, however, find his work to be of the highest quality, including Elgar and Sir John Barbirolli. Hulme writes that \"German's orchestral music certainly does not deserve the neglect it has suffered, for it still has much to offer modern audiences. Beautifully crafted, colourful and vital, its pleasing and distinctive personality is still capable of inspiring the kind of affectionate regard it once so readily kindled.\"", "The first Edward German Festival was held in 2006 in German's birth town, Whitchurch, Shropshire.

By the age of 14, he was winning public praise from The Times as \"a bravura player of no mean order\" in a concert in October 1878.
