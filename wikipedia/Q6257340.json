He served until 1983, when he was deselected as Labour candidate in favour of Sir Albert Bore. However, subsequent parliamentary boundary changes led to Bore being replaced by Clare Short, who had been selected as Labour candidate in the neighbouring constituency of Birmingham Handsworth, which was largely merged with Birmingham Ladywood. Sever instead stood in Meriden, a safe seat for the Conservative Party, but lost by 15,018 votes.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Sever"]}, {"page": "Quentin Davies", "response": ["He contested the 1977 Birmingham Ladywood by-election for the Conservatives.
