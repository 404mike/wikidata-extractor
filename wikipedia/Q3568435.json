A correspondent and friend of Charles Darwin, Tegetmeier studied pigeon breeds and the optimality of hexagonal honeycomb cells constructed by honeybees. He wrote a number of books dealing with home economics, poultry farming, pigeon breeds, bee-keeping and on the maintenance of livestock.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorking chicken", "response": ["The Dorking was included in the first poultry standard, The Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry, edited by William Bernhardt Tegetmeier and published in 1865 by the original Poultry Club of Great Britain. In the late nineteenth century, separate breed societies formed for the various colour varieties; two of these merged to form the Dorking Club, and a Scottish Dorking Club also formed. By about the time of the Second World War, none of these remained active. Interest in the breed had decreased rapidly, and it drew close to extinction. The Dorking Club was restarted in 1970."]}, {"page": "Cochin chicken", "response": ["The Cochin was included in the first edition of the Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry, prepared by William Bernhardt Tegetmeier for the first Poultry Club of Great Britain in 1865.

The letter advised it would be 'a meeting of gentlemen connected with literature and the fine arts, and warmly interested in the promotion of Christian knowledge, and the sale of exciseable liquors' with a view to 'forming a social society or club'. The inaugural gathering would also decide upon the new association's 'suitable designation'.thumb|313x313px|Richard Savage, poet (c 1697 -1743)Around 20 attended the first meeting including William Brough, Robert Brough, Leicester Silk Buckingham, John Deffett Francis, Gustav von Franck, Bill Hale, Sala, Dr G.

It is among the oldest of British chicken breeds: birds described as \"Old Sussex or Kent Fowl\" were shown at the first poultry show at London Zoo in 1845. The Sussex was not included in the first poultry standard, the Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry of William Bernhardt Tegetmeier, in 1865. The breed standard for the Sussex was drawn up in 1902, with three colour varieties, the light, the red and the speckled. Of these, the speckled was the oldest. The development of the light variety was probably influenced by Oriental breeds such as the Brahma and Cochin, and also by the silver-grey Dorking. The red was originally black-breasted; it and the brown may have been influenced by Indian Game. The buff variety appeared in the 1920s, and was followed by the white, a sport from the light. The most recent variety is the silver."]}, {"page": "English Pouter", "response": ["William Bernhardt Tegetmeier proposed that the English Pouter originated from cross breeding the old pigeon breeds the Dutch Cropper, Uploper and the Parisian Pouter.  Each of these breeds is described in works dating from the 17th century. However, in an earlier account, John Moore suggested that the breed was the result of cross breeding between a type of cropper and horseman (both 18th century pigeon types). Historically, the English Pouter was also called the Pouting Horseman, due to the links with the Horseman breed. The modern breeds of croppers, such as the Norwich Cropper, originate from the English Pouter."]}, {"page": "Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869", "response": ["In 1868, Professor Alfred Newton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science on the \"On the Zoological Aspect of the Game Laws\".Barclay-Smith (1959) In particular, he urged for protection of birds of prey and seabirds during the breeding season.

The compilation of the standard was then taken over by the second, current Poultry Club of Great Britain.

Darwin commented in the second edition of his Descent of Man that \"Some new illustrations have been introduced, and four of the old drawings [by Brehm] have been replaced by better ones, done from life by  Mr. T. W. Wood.\"  Wood took the trouble to ask Darwin for a copy of the book \"as I should wish to know what characters were particularly pointed out in the text\". One of the new drawings was a \"Side view of male Argus pheasant, while displaying before the female\"; Wood based the drawing on his own careful observation of the birds in the London zoological gardens, and was praised for it by William Bernhardt Tegetmeier, the editor of The Field magazine, for which Wood often worked, as \"the first correct delineation of the display\"."]}, {"page": "William Bernhard Tegetmeier", "response": ["#REDIRECTWilliam Bernhardt Tegetmeier"]}, {"page": "Tegetmeier", "response": ["#redirect William Bernhardt Tegetmeier"]}, {"page": "Henry H. Slater", "response": ["In 1874 he accompanied the botanist Isaac Bayley Balfour and George Gulliver aboard HMS Shearwater on an expedition to observe the transit of Venus on Rodrigues. In addition to studies of the flora and fauna, Slater excavated the subfossil bones of extinct birds, including the Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria) and Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus). His records were used by the zoologists Albert G\u00fcnther and Alfred Newton to write the first scientific description of the Rodrigues starling in 1879. During a stay in Mauritius in 1875 he and George Gulliver explored the flora, the herpetofauna, and the aquatic avifauna. In 1885 he traveled with Thomas Carter to Iceland. Based partly on his work there, he wrote the Manual of the Birds of Iceland, published in 1901. In 1897 Slater described the short-tailed parrotbill (Paradoxornis davidianus) and the sulphur-breasted warbler (Phylloscopus ricketti). Together with William Bernhardt Tegetmeier and Frederick William Frohawk, he wrote the fifth volume of British Birds With Their Nests and Eggs (1898).

While in London he befriended the artist and caricaturist Joseph Kenny Meadows and the writer Charles Dickens whom he accompanied on expeditions to the slums, to help discover material for Dickens' books. While in London, Francis also met John Ruskin and William Thackery. In 1857, he became a founding member of the Savage Club, a literary gentleman's society, attending the society's first meeting in Drury Lane with William Brough, Leicester Silk Buckingham and William Bernhardt Tegetmeier among others. It is also possible that Francis was responsible for the name of the Society since 'it was he who presented the Club with the tomahawks, assegais and other savage weapons that decorated the walls of the Club.'"]}, {"page": "William Tegetmeier", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Bernhardt Tegetmeier"]}, {"page": "W.
