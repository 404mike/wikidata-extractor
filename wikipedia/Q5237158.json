He worked in Glasgow as a Labour Party organiser from 1969, before becoming a full-time councillor. He was for three years, from 1972 a member of Glasgow City Council, and a member of Strathclyde Regional Council from 1974 until his election to Parliament.\nHe was elected as a Labour MP at the 1979 general election for Glasgow Shettleston following the retirement of Myer Galpern. He represented that constituency from then until the  2005 election, at which point he was elected from Glasgow East. He did not reach the front bench in his long parliamentary career, but served on many select committees, including chairing both the Transport (1987\u20131992) and Scotland committees (1992\u20131997). He was latterly a member of the Chairman's Panel.\nOn 27 June 2008 it was reported that he would stand down due to ill health. These reports have also linked his ill health with stress brought on by predictions that his parliamentary expenses were to be investigated. On 30 June he was appointed Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, confirming his resignation.He is married with a son and a daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Brown", "response": ["In the local elections on 1 May 2008, Labour suffered its worst results in 40 years, finishing in third place with a projected 24% share of the national vote.

A by-election in Glasgow East triggered by the resignation of David Marshall saw Labour struggle to appoint a candidate, eventually settling for Margaret Curran, a sitting MSP in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats all derided Labour for their disorganised nature, with Alex Salmond commenting \"This is their 'lost weekend'\u2014they don't have a leader in Scotland, they don't have a candidate in Glasgow East, and they have a prime minister who refuses to come to the constituency\".
