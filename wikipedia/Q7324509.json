Born in Prestwich, Lancashire, to a family who lived in humble circumstances, he taught himself to read, and learned the basic principles of botany. Although living as a pauper for most of his life, in 1849 he published A Botanical Guide to the Flowering Plants, Ferns, Mosses and Alg\u00e6, Found Indigenous Within Sixteen Miles of Manchester, which became one of the standard texts on the flora then commonly found in the Manchester area. According to his obituary in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign, Buxton was one of \"nature's gentlemen\" and \"his true and correct pronunciation of scientific terms have caused many who heard him to believe he was an accomplished classical scholar\". He was acknowledged by the geologist Edward William Binney as \"the most profound thinker of his class\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
