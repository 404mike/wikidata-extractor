He was a later signing of artist manager Brian Epstein, whose biggest act was the Beatles. He was born to Patrick Quigley and Dorothy Gower. He is the twin brother of Patricia Quigley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Epstein", "response": ["Within months, the Beatles were international stars. Epstein accompanied them to America, where he was besieged by merchandising offers, but had signed away 90 percent of the rights in advance. This is viewed as his one miscalculation. Some of Epstein's other young discoveries had also prospered under his management. They included Gerry and the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Tommy Quickly and Cilla Black. In 1967, he died of a sedative overdose, ruled as accidental, at the age of 32.", "Epstein also successfully managed Gerry and the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas (who had four hits with Lennon\u2013McCartney songs), the Fourmost (Lennon wrote their first two singles), the Cyrkle (Epstein's first American group), and Cilla Black (who was Epstein's only female artist), as well as Tommy Quickly and Sounds Incorporated (later known as Sounds Inc.). He sent his roster of artists on \"package tours\" around the UK, a common practice at the time. This involved short sets by each act, alternating with a comp\u00e8re or a comedian. Epstein once revealed that even though he was entitled to be reimbursed by acts for expenses incurred, he paid for his own flights to and from the United States, as he did not see himself as being part of a touring group. Photographs, transport, and international telephone calls were paid from his own 25 percent share in profits."]}, {"page": "Jimmie Nicol", "response": ["When Ringo Starr became ill with tonsillitis and was hospitalised on 3 June 1964, the eve of the Beatles' 1964 Australasian tour, the band's manager Brian Epstein and their producer George Martin urgently discussed the feasibility of using a stand-in drummer rather than cancelling part of the tour. Martin suggested Jimmie Nicol as he had recently used him on a recording session with Tommy Quickly. Nicol had also drummed on a 'Top Six' budget label album as part of an uncredited session band, as well as an extended play single (with three tracks on each side) of Beatles cover versions (marketed as 'Teenagers Choice' and titled Beatlemania) which meant that he already knew the songs and their arrangements. Producer Bill Wellings and Shubdubs trumpeter Johnny Harris (freelancing as an arranger and composer) were responsible for putting together alternative budget cover versions of songs taken from the British Hit Parade aimed at cash-strapped teenagers. Harris said: \"The idea was for me to try and guess which six songs would be topping the charts about a month ahead. I would do the arrangements and then go into the studio and record 'sound a-likes'; the first EP (extended play) released got to number 30 in the charts. Jimmie was on drums and, as you can imagine, we covered a lot of the Beatles' songs.\" Although John Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly accepted the idea of using an understudy, George Harrison threatened to pull out of the tour telling Epstein and Martin: \"If Ringo's not going, then neither am I. You can find two replacements.\" Martin recalled: \"They nearly didn't do the Australia tour. George is a very loyal person. It took all of Brian's and my persuasion to tell George that if he didn't do it he was letting everybody down.\" Tony Barrow, who was the Beatles' press officer at the time, later commented: \"Brian saw it as the lesser of two evils; cancel the tour and upset thousands of fans or continue and upset the Beatles.\" Ringo stated that \"it was very strange, them going off without me. They'd taken Jimmie Nicol and I thought they didn't love me any more \u2013 all that stuff went through my head.\" The arrangements were made very quickly, from a telephone call to Nicol at his home in West London inviting him to attend an audition/rehearsal at Abbey Road Studios, to packing his bags, all in the same day. At a press conference a reporter mischievously asked John Lennon why Pete Best, who had been the Beatles' previous drummer for two years but dismissed by the group on the eve of stardom, was not being given the opportunity of replacing Ringo, to which Lennon replied: \"He's got his own group [Pete Best & the All Stars], and it might have looked as if we were taking him back, which is not good for him.\""]}, {"page": "Lennon\u2013McCartney", "response": ["|1963 || Tommy Quickly || \"Tip of My Tongue\" || style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014 ||"]}, {"page": "No Reply (song)", "response": ["\"No Reply\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1964 album Beatles for Sale.

Lennon originally gave the song to another artist managed by Brian Epstein, Tommy Quickly, in June 1964, but Quickly decided not to use it.
