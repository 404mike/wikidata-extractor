According to Paul Hartnoll, the track was recorded \"under the stairs\" of their parents' house in \"a knocked-through stair cupboard that my dad set up as a home office\". The track received its first live airing at a club night hosted by the promoter Que Pasa (Mark, Andrew and Nick Maddox) in a local Sevenoaks venue called the Grasshopper on Boxing Day.

Several singles and EPs followed, and their first self-titled album, a collection of tracks recorded at various times, was released in late 1991.", "Crucially, the expanded TV coverage of the 1994 Glastonbury Festival by Channel 4 meant that Orbital's set reached a huge audience, in what is regarded as a pivotal moment.

Being young myself, I just thought, 'It's about time \u2013 of course we should have acid house at Glastonbury'. It used to annoy me. I just used to think it should be happening.\"", "Paul Hartnoll continued to record music under his own name, including tracks for the 2005 game Wipeout Pure for the PSP.
