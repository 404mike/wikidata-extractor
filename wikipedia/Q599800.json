He published several illustrated shell books, and a translation of Gmelin's edition of Linnaeus' Systema Naturae in 1806.\nTurton died at Bideford. His shell collection is now located at the Smithsonian Institution.\nThe bivalve genus Turtonia and the species Galeomma turtoni was named for him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*William Turton (1762\u20131835), British naturalist,Abbreviation in zoology: Turton author of A manual of the land and freshwater shells of the British Islands"]}, {"page": "American marten", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "List of malacologists", "response": ["*William Turton (1762\u20131835) Great Britain, naturalist"]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Turton \u2013 William Turton (1762\u20131835)"]}, {"page": "Charles Darwin's education", "response": ["The brothers went for regular Sunday walks to the seaport of Leith and the shores of the Firth of Forth.

He touched them so they emitted ink and swam away, and also found a damaged starfish beginning to regrow its arms. Eras completed his external hospital study, and returned to Shrewsbury, Darwin found other zoophytes and, on the shore \"between Leith & Portobello\", caught more sea mice which \"when thrown into the sea rolled themselves up like hedgehogs.\" "]}, {"page": "Turton", "response": ["*William Turton (1762\u20131835), British naturalist"]}, {"page": "Pupillidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Abida (gastropod)", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Arianta", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Ena (gastropod)", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Pupilloidea", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Haminoea", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Curtitoma trevelliana", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Turrisipho fenestratus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Littorina fabalis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William Turton"]}, {"page": "Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae", "response": ["The following explanations are based on William Turton's translations who rearranged and corrected earlier editions published by Johann Friedrich Gmelin, Johan Christian Fabricius and Carl Ludwig Willdenow:"]}]}}
