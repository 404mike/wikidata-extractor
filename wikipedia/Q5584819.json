Arthur was a first-team regular in his four years at Boghead and moved to hometown club Raith Rovers in 1988. In six years at Stark's Park, Arthur played in over 150 league matches, tasting promotion to the Premier Division when the club won the Scottish First Division championship in 1992-93. A move to Forfar Athletic beckoned in 1994 following Raith's relegation and after playing in just under 100 league games for them, including winning the 1994-95 Scottish Third Division, Arthur saw out his career with spells at Arbroath and Montrose. Upon retiring, Arthur remained at Montrose as goalkeeping coach.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur (surname)", "response": ["*Gordon Arthur (footballer) (born 1958), Scottish former footballer", "*Gordon Arthur (bishop) (1909\u20131992), Anglican bishop in Australia"]}, {"page": "Gordon Arthur", "response": ["Gordon Arthur may refer to:", "* Gordon Arthur (footballer) (born 1958), Scottish former footballer", "* Gordon Arthur (bishop) (1909\u20131992), Anglican bishop in Australia"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Gordon Arthur"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["* The League match against Clyde on 15 November marked Gordon Arthur's 100th appearance for Dumbarton in all national competitions - the 92nd Dumbarton player to reach this milestone."]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["| Gordon Arthur"]}]}}
