Since then the house had been divided into flats and owned by Highgate School, where Hill was a Governor from 1929 to 1960. It has now been sold, redeveloped and renamed as Hurstbourne. In Hill's time, according to his grandson Nicholas Humphrey, regular guests at the house included 18 exiled Nobel laureates, his brother-in-law, the economist John Maynard Keynes, and friends Stephen Hawking and Sigmund Freud. After-dinner conversations in the drawing room would inevitably involve passionate debates about science or politics. \"Every Sunday we would have to attend a tea party at grandpa\u2019s house and apart from entertaining some extraordinary guests, he would devise some great games for us, such as frog racing in the garden or looking through the lens of a (dissected) sheep\u2019s eye\". Sir Ralph Kohn FRS who proposed the Blue plaque, said: \"The Nobel Prize winner A. V. Hill contributed vastly to our understanding of muscle physiology.  His work has resulted in wide-ranging application in sports medicine. As an outstanding Humanitarian and Parliamentarian, he was uncompromising in his condemnation of the Nazi regime for its persecution of scientists and others. A. V. Hill played a crucial role in assisting and rescuing many refugees to continue their work in this country\"."]}, {"page": "Kellogg College, Oxford", "response": ["* Sir Ralph Kohn, Bynum Tudor Visiting Fellow; pharmacologist, entrepreneur, musician"]}, {"page": "Kohn", "response": ["* Ralph Kohn (1927\u20132016), British medical scientist and benefactor of music"]}, {"page": "School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester", "response": ["* Ralph Kohn, British medical scientist and founder of the Kohn foundation.
