The case remains a precedent for the legal principles that holding strong political views is no excuse for violent acts, that prosecuting only a few out of a number of potential defendants is permitted, that a defendant's individual acts should not be considered in isolation but must take their share of blame from the broader context of the disorder, and that encouraging or promoting disorder by words or actions is as culpable as participating in it.  The case also continues to be cited in deportation cases, for the principle that a decision to recommend deportation following a conviction must be justified by the potential detriment to the UK if the person is allowed to stay. The president of the National Union of Students, Jack Straw (who was Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001), accused the court of discriminating against students."]}, {"page": "British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd", "response": ["Megaw LJ and Sir Eric Sachs concurred."]}, {"page": "Jeremiah Harman (judge)", "response": ["In 1987 he married thirdly, Katharine Frances Goddard Pulay (died 2002), daughter of Rt.
