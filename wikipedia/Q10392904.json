He played for seven different Football League clubs during a twenty-year career, and had four separate spells at Scarborough, his hometown club. He later coached at the club and ran the club's Centre of Excellence and Football in the Community sections until the club's demise in 2007, whereupon he moved the youth system, community section and Under-19 team of Scarborough F.C. to George Pindar Community Sports College on the outskirts of town.\nIn 2008, Cook was appointed Director of Football for the newly formed Scarborough Town F.C., an adult extension of the Under-19 Academy and which he led to the championship of Teesside League Division Two in 2008\u201309, whilst his youth team won the \"double\" in the Northern Under-19 Alliance (Eastern Division). In 2009\u201310 he guided Scarborough Town to the championship of the Wearside League (Step 7) with the team also winning the prestigious Sunderland Shipowners Cup. The youth team retained its title in the Northern Under-19 Alliance.\nIn October 2010, Cook replaced Mark Ward as the manager of Pickering Town, taking control of both the first team and the under 19 side. After one season at the club, he left in May 2011 to take over at Bridlington Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cook (surname)", "response": ["*Mitch Cook (born 1961), English football player"]}, {"page": "Jamie Murphy (footballer, born 1973)", "response": ["Manchester-born Murphy began his career at Blackpool in 1990, where he was mainly a deputy to Mitch Cook.

Their league form, however, sunk to new lows that season. Wicks was harshly sacked just before the season started and replaced by the more experienced Billy Ayre, who himself lasted just five months as manager and was sacked with the club bottom of the league. The managerial merry-go-round came full circle as Ray McHale was reinstated as manager just a year-and-a-half since being sacked, but he had little more luck turning things around and they finished second-bottom of the Football League after statistically the club's worst-ever season, with only goals scored keeping them above bottom-place Exeter City. 1995\u201396 proved to be another thoroughly dismal campaign, and a horrific late-season run resulted in another second-bottom finish, albeit with a more comfortable gap over bottom-placed Torquay United. McHale finally threw the towel in and resigned weeks before the season ended, leaving coach Mitch Cook in charge for the final few matches, and making this the fourth season in a row that the club had not kept a manager in charge throughout the campaign.Adamson, p. 96."]}, {"page": "Paul Evans (football manager)", "response": ["In 1986, Neil Warnock went to Scarborough as Manager and he took Evans, his former goalkeeper at Burton Albion, with him as his Assistant Manager. Warnock and Evans arrived at Scarborough and quickly signed Cec Podd, Barry Gallagher and Paul Kendell from Halifax Town, Mike Brolly and Tommy Graham from Scunthorpe United, David Kaye from Chester City and Andy Harrison and Steve Richards from Kettering Town. Warnock also added Stuart Mell who was with Warnock and Evans at Burton Albion. The season started pretty average so Warnock signed Ian Bennyworth and Mitch Cook. With the season still going pretty average; Warnock signed Kevin Blackwell on a months loan from Barnet in November 1986 and this started an upturn in fortunes. After the months loan ended Warnock paid Barry Fry's Barnet \u00a32,000 for Blackwell's services. On 13 December Scarborough went top of the league following Barnet's loss to Maidstone United. However, a week after this the club was knocked sideways as the chairman; Barry Adamson died of a heart attack at an FA Trophy game against Morecambe. At one point in April, Scarborough were seven points clear at the top of the GM Vauxhall Conference, and due to Barnet losing at Stafford Rangers Scarborough won the title and were subsequently promoted to the Fourth Division. Basically, Warnock and Evans had brought instant success with Scarborough winning the Football Conference in 1987. Warnock and Evans remained at Scarborough until they moved on to Notts County in 1989 after Warnock had fallen out with chairman Geoffrey Richmond."]}, {"page": "1992 Football League Fourth Division play-off Final", "response": ["Blackpool faced Barnet in the other semi-final and the first match was played on 10 May 1992 at Underhill in London.

Bamber headed a corner from David Eyres back across goal for Paul Groves who scored with a header from close range.
