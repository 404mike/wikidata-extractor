In early 1818 he delivered a series of talks on \"the English Poets\", from Chaucer to his own time. Though somewhat uneven in quality, his lectures were ultimately judged a success. In making arrangements for the lectures, he had met Peter George Patmore, Assistant Secretary of the Surrey Institution where the lectures were presented. Patmore soon became a friend as well as Hazlitt's confidant in the most troubled period of the latter's life.Wardle, pp. 211\u201322; Jones, p. 281.", "By pouring out his tale of woe to anyone he happened to meet (including his friends Peter George Patmore and James Sheridan Knowles), he was able to find a cathartic outlet for his misery. But catharsis was also provided by his recording the course of his love in a thinly disguised fictional account, published anonymously in May 1823 as Liber Amoris; or, The New Pygmalion. (Enough clues were present so that the identity of the writer did not remain hidden for long.)"]}, {"page": "John Gibson Lockhart", "response": ["One of the main literary organs of the Cockney School was The London Magazine. Its editor, John Scott, felt that Blackwood\u2019s hounding of Keats had contributed to his 1821 death, at age 26. Scott also felt it was his duty to defend his authors against Lockhart and Blackwood\u2019s. To that end, he published an attack of Lockhart and Blackwood\u2019s; Lockhart promptly asked a London friend, Jonathan Henry Christie, to visit Scott and demand an apology. Scott refused; a series of letters were exchanged and the argument evolved into Scott\u2019s insistence that Lockhart admit that he (Lockwood) was, in fact, the anonymous editor of Blackwood\u2019s (it was common practice at the time to act an editor, and/or as a writer, anonymously, or using a pseudonym). According to the papers of Scott\u2019s friend Peter George Patmore, who tried to negotiate a truce and kept a meticulous record of the matter, not only did Lockwood refuse to admit to his editorship, but he responded with \"abusive epithets\". With both men seeing their honour at stake, there was no going back and, on February 16, 1821, they proceeded with the duel. But Lockhart did not attend; Jonathan Christie stepped into his place with his friend, James Traill, as his second. John Scott was wounded and died ten days later. Christie and Traill were tried for murder. They were acquitted, but Christie\u2019s life was ruined. Lockhart was not blamed."]}, {"page": "Coventry Patmore", "response": ["The eldest son of author Peter George Patmore, Coventry Patmore was born at Woodford in EssexMeynell, Alice. \"Coventry Patmore.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11.
