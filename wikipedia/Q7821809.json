The Foreign Office duly released a first batch of more than 1,200 records from 12 former colonial territories in April 2012, a portion of some 10,000 files that Britain removed from 37 of its colonies. Badger described the migrated archives episode as \"embarrassing, scandalous. .\u00a0.\u00a0. These documents should have been in the public archives in the 1980s. It's long overdue.\" Harvard's Caroline Elkins observed: \"At the time, Britain was in the middle of parallel, massive cover-ups. While the government was besieged publicly with allegations of brutalities in the detention camps and the cover-up of systematised violence\u2014and denying all allegations\u2014it was culling and purging the record. The process\u2014practised in other colonies as well\u2014deliberately sought to remove incriminating evidence. So, too, did it seek to shape the future colonial archive and the realities it would produce.\"", "As the Guardian's summary shows, even after the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO continued to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated subversion of democracy by the British government in British Guiana in the 1950s and 1960s, though Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London, said this was simply not credible: \"When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO that they had been destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes 'a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of\u00a0'.\" Elkins agreed that it was \"frankly impossible, given that there were well-established procedures for handling archives at decolonisation by the 1960s. Warning bells should be going off.\" Drayton also noted that the FCO \"refuses to make public the full inventory of the Hanslope Park archive. While we have full confidence in Professor Badger, many historians now wonder if he was not handed an archive which, once again, had been screened and culled.\" Drayton further mused that \"it was almost as if the material now made public had also been screened according to the same criteria applied c.\u00a01960\u2014preventing potential prosecutions, protecting collaborators, and protecting the reputation of Britain.\""]}]}}
