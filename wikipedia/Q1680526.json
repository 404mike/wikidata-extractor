In Edinburgh, he resided for a short time during 1864 with his journalist brother, Edward, then an assistant to Edinburgh Courant publisher, James Hannay, whom he painted (exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1864), as well as author David Smith (brother of the poet Alexander Smith). Another work, entitled Head was also exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy the same year.Jewish Chronicle 21 April 1893 p. 17", "The novelist and journalist James Hannay sat for Goodman in Edinburgh in 1864. The picture was a three-quarter sized oil painting later displayed at the Roysl Scottish Academy, along with the David Smith painting. At the time Hannay sat for Goodman, he was editor of the Edinburgh Courant. Goodman's brother Edward was assistant editor at the Courant and had warned Goodman that Hannay was not very talkative. The ice was finally broken between the two when Hannay's son came along to the sitting. Goodman and Hannay became friends and he writes of sketching the group of guests at one of Hannay's many social gatherings. On this occasion the guests included John George Edgar, Sam Bough, David Smith, John Carmichael (classical master at Edinburgh High School), J.P.Steele (doctor and journalist), and Walter's brother, Edward. Goodman notes how this sketch was useful later when he painted Hannay and Smith. Hannay became vice-consul of Barcelona around 1868 \u2013 a position he held until his untimely death at the age of 46.", "In contrast to James Hannay, Wilkie Collins was a very talkative, if less attractive (by his own admission) subject. The Collins portrait would take two years to complete. The sittings were interrupted by Goodman's severe illness in 1881 and Collins' own struggle with gout. Goodman moved temporarily to Broadstairs to recover, whilst Collins went to live in nearby Ramsgate. Goodman suggested they meet up, in either town, but Collins was reluctant to travel to Broastairs as it reminded him too much of his dear departed friends and Broadstairs housemates, Charles Dickens and Augustus Egg. Goodman went to Ramsgate, where Collins related many a fascinating tale of his friendship with Dickens. For example, it was at Broadstairs that Dickens came upon the original aunt in David Copperfield. Some of Dickens' seafaring experiences were derived from chats with the old boatmen on the jetty. Prior to this portrait being exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists, after Collins' death in 1889, it was privately shown at Goodman's studio to a number of Collins' personal friends. These included Georgina Hogarth and Mary Dickens. In his final letter to Goodman, Collins states  I am very glad to hear that Miss Hogarth likes the portrait. Her favourable opinion is well worth having.", "|  Sketch of a social gathering at the Edinburgh home of James Hannay.
