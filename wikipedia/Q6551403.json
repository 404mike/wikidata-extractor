All the councils eventually backed down except Liverpool City Council and Lambeth. The district auditor found that the council had lost interest on tax payments as a result, which was held to be due to the \"wilful misconduct\" of Knight and 31 other councillors. Each was required to repay the amount of lost interest in a surcharge and banned from holding office for five years from 1986.

Examples include the Greater London Council under \"Red\" Ken Livingstone, Lambeth council under \"Red\" Ted Knight and Linda Bellos, Liverpool council under Derek Hatton and Sheffield council (sometimes referred to as \"the People's Republic of South Yorkshire\") under David Blunkett. These authorities were often derided as \"loony left\" by Conservative supporting tabloid newspapers."]}]}}
