He was dubbed \"Captain Calamity\" in 2001 after he needed to be rescued from multiple misadventures while sailing. He later moved to the Shetland Islands where he took to protesting around constitutional matters. In 2008 he made claims relating to the formation of a micronation which he called the Sovereign State of Forvik. His disputes led to several court appearances. He was convicted of road traffic offences, vandalism and declared bankrupt. Hill unsuccessfully stood for election to Orkney and Shetland as an Independent in the 2017 UK general election where he came last.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Micronation", "response": ["* The Crown Dependency of Forvik is an island in Shetland, currently recognized as part of the UK. Stuart Hill claims that independence comes from an arrangement struck in 1468 between King Christian I of Denmark/Norway and Scotland's James III, whereby Christian pawned the Shetland Islands to James in order to raise money for his daughter's dowry. Hill claims that the dowry was never paid and therefore Forvik is not part of the UK and should be a crown dependency like the Isle of Man. Hill encouraged the rest of Shetland to declare independence.", "* Stuart Hill, founder of Sovereign State of Forvik"]}, {"page": "Forewick Holm", "response": ["There are no records of the island being permanently inhabited at any time, and in 2008, Stuart Hill was residing there for a few days a year.  Its small size renders it unable to support any significant population.  However, there is some evidence of a circular construction on its SSE tip, which could represent anything from a sheep pen, to a Pictish era building.", "Current ownership of the islet is in dispute between Papa Stour resident Mark King and Cunningsburgh resident Stuart Hill.  Hill is an Englishman who settled in Shetland after being shipwrecked there in 2001 during a failed attempt to circumnavigate the British Isles, earning him the nickname \"Captain Calamity\".   Hill claims that the island's udal title (allodial title) was donated to him in 2008 by the owner Mark King.  He claims to have a signed, witnessed document confirming this. King has stated this is not the case, but that he had agreed to sell the island to Hill. In March 2009, King still claimed ownership stating that Hill had not paid for the island as agreed."]}]}}
