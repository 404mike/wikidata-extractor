He was the elder brother of zoologist George Robert Gray and son of the pharmacologist and botanist Samuel Frederick Gray (1766\u20131828). The standard author abbreviation J.E.Gray is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name. The same is used for a zoological name.\nGray was keeper of zoology at the British Museum in London from 1840 until Christmas 1874, before the natural history holdings were split off to the Natural History Museum. He published several catalogues of the museum collections that included comprehensive discussions of animal groups and descriptions of new species. He improved the zoological collections to make them amongst the best in the world.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amphibian", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray"]}, {"page": "Alligatoridae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray"]}, {"page": "Cheirogaleidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray"]}, {"page": "Equidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray"]}, {"page": "Earless seal", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray"]}, {"page": "Gray whale", "response": ["John Edward Gray placed it in its own genus in 1865, naming it in honour of physician and zoologist Daniel Frederik Eschricht. The common name of the whale comes from its coloration. The subfossil remains of now extinct gray whales from the Atlantic coasts of England and Sweden were used by Gray to make the first scientific description of a species then surviving only in Pacific waters. The living Pacific species was described by Cope as Rhachianectes glaucus in 1869. Skeletal comparisons showed the Pacific species to be identical to the Atlantic remains in the 1930s, and Gray's naming has been generally accepted since. Although identity between the Atlantic and Pacific populations cannot be proven by anatomical data, its skeleton is distinctive and easy to distinguish from that of all other living whales."]}, {"page": "Hyena", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray"]}, {"page": "Homininae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray"]}, {"page": "Kangaroo", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray"]}, {"page": "Koala", "response": ["The koala was given its generic name Phascolarctos in 1816 by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, who would not give it a specific name until further review.

Because Phascolarctos was published first, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, it has priority as the official name of the genus.Jackson, pp. 58\u201359. French naturalist Anselme Ga\u00ebtan Desmarest proposed the name Phascolarctos fuscus in 1820, suggesting that the brown-coloured versions were a different species than the grey ones.
