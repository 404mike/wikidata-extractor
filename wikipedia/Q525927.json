However, he went on to sign a permanent contract after completing the trial period. Palace already had a successful strike partnership in Ian Wright and Andy Gray, though Coppell moved Gray into central midfield to accommodate Bright up front. The \"Eagles\" were pressing for promotion out of the Second Division, but finished two points outside the play-offs in 1986\u201387. Bright was named on the PFA Team of the Year and earned the Golden Boot for the highest scorer in the division in 1987\u201388 with 24 goals, although the club finished one place and two points outside of the play-offs. A third-place finish in 1988\u201389 secured them a place in the play-offs and Bright scored in the semi-final victory over Swindon Town, which helped Palace to reach the play-off final; Palace then beat Blackburn Rovers 4\u20133 on aggregate to win promotion to the top-flight."]}, {"page": "Ron Noades", "response": ["In 1991, Noades provoked controversy with his comments on the racial make-up of his team: \"The black players at this club lend the side a lot of skill and flair, but you also need white players in there to balance things up and give the team some brains and some common sense.\" The fall-out led to several black players leaving the club, including key players Ian Wright, Mark Bright and Andy Gray."]}, {"page": "Andy Turner (footballer)", "response": ["Turner signed with Tottenham Hotspur after leaving school and recovered well enough from a broken leg to make his first-team debut under the stewardship of Terry Venables on 15 August 1992, starting in a 0\u20130 draw at Southampton, before he was replaced by Andy Gray on 75 minutes.

The second half was more lively, with Geoff Thomas scoring for Palace in the 66th minute with a diving header from a John Salako corner.
