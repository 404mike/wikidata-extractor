She lived in Derby and the small village of Barrow-upon-Trent, which is south of the city. She has been described as an almost anonymous author, as few of her works were attributed to her on first publication. She is credited with the first review of George Eliot's book, Adam Bede, that recognized that it had to be written by a woman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adam Bede", "response": ["Immediately recognised as a significant literary work, Adam Bede has enjoyed a largely positive critical reputation since its publication. An anonymous 1859 review in The Athenaeum praised it as a \"novel of the highest class,\" and The Times called it \"a first-rate novel.\" An anonymous review by Anne Mozley was the first to speculate that the novel was probably written by a woman.Sister as Journalist: The Almost Anonymous Career of Anne Mozley, Ellen Jordan, Victorian Periodicals Review, Vol. 37, No. 3 (Fall, 2004), pp. 315\u2013341, Published by: Research Society for Victorian Periodicals Contemporary reviewers, often influenced by nostalgia for the earlier period represented in Bede, enthusiastically praised Eliot's characterisations and realistic representations of rural life. Charles Dickens wrote: \"The whole country life that the story is set in, is so real, and so droll and genuine, and yet so selected and polished by art, that I cannot praise it enough to you.\" (Hunter, S. 122) In fact, in early criticism, the tragedy of infanticide has often been overlooked in favour of the peaceful idyllic world and familiar personalities Eliot recreated.Adam Bede, George Eliot: INTRODUCTION.\" Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism. Ed. Juliet Byington and Suzanne Dewsbury. Vol. 89. Thomson Gale, 2001. eNotes.com. 2006. 11 Mar, 2007 Other critics have been less generous. Henry James, among others, resented the narrator's interventions. In particular, Chapter 15 has fared poorly among scholars because of the author's/narrator's moralising and meddling in an attempt to sway readers' opinions of Hetty and Dinah. Other critics have objected to the resolution of the story. In the final moments, Hetty, about to be executed for infanticide, is saved by her seducer, Arthur Donnithorne. Critics have argued that this deus ex machina ending negates the moral lessons learned by the main characters. Without the eleventh hour reprieve, the suffering of Adam, Arthur, and Hetty would have been more realistically concluded. In addition, some scholars feel that Adam's marriage to Dinah is another instance of the author's/narrator's intrusiveness. These instances have been found to directly conflict with the otherwise realistic images and events of the novel."]}, {"page": "Barrow upon Trent", "response": ["Barrow-Upon-Trent was home to the writer Anne MozleyEllen Jordan, \u2018Mozley, Anne (1809\u20131891)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 17 Nov 2014 and the artist George Turner (1841\u20131910) who moved here from Cromford.
