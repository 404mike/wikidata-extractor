He received his Bachelor of Music from Oxford with the support of the Earl of Bath in 1613, and also from Cambridge in 1640. He was employed as both an organist and clergyman at the Cathedral after he obtained his first degree. He was subsequently ordained to the diaconate, later becoming vicarius (minor canon). In 1615, he published a collection entitled Sacred Hymnes of 3, 4, 5 and 6 parts for the Voyces and Vyols, which represents most of his known works. His other works include Preces (both for five voices), four settings of the daily canticles, several simple four-part anthems, slightly more complex five-part anthems, and verse anthems. Roughly a dozen of these works were recorded in the 1990s, and many were performed by the choir of Ely Cathedral, including Blessed be the Lord God; Hear, O Lord; Have mercy; I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; My Lord is hence removed and laid; O sing unto the Lord; O ye little flock; the Second Service (Cesar's) and Sing, O heavn's. Amner also wrote a pavan and galliard for viols and a single keyboard piece that stands out historically as the only recognized group of variations on a metrical psalm tune (O Lord in thee is all my trust).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford poetry anthologies", "response": ["Henry Aldrich - William Allingham - Drummond Allison - John Amner - Matthew Arnold - W.

Although Brett thought Merro might have begun copying his collection around 1600, 1615 is the more likely date for when the collection was begun.", "Monson hypothesized that Merro's intention was compiling a collection of serious vocal music.  He based this conjecture on the presence of more than 70 full anthems in four and five parts, quite a large number.  Of the modern entries (aside from those written by local composers), most are composed by John Amner and Thomas Tomkins whose style relates more to the older composers (such as Thomas Tallis and John Mundy) than of contemporaneous ones (such as Michael East).  Monson deduces that Merro's curation can be seen as an act of preservation since the repertory he favored was quickly falling out of favor.", "In the works copied for viols with solo and chorus, there is evidence of Merro's bending toward contemporary taste, most conspicuously in the works by John Amner. Two works by Michael East, \"When Israel came out of Egypt\" and \"Sing we merrily\" are not copied from the printed editions (which appeared in 1610 and 1624 respectively) but from earlier manuscript versions in secular sources.
