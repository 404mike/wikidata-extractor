Born in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, he played in The Football League for Manchester United during the 1896\u201397 season. He signed for the club in June 1896 and played for the reserve team until first-team goalkeeper Joe Ridgway suffered an injury in September 1896. Wetherell made his debut on 21 September in a 3\u20132 away win over Walsall. The signing of Frank Barrett from Dundee shortly after meant Wetherell sat out the next two games, but he played once more against Small Heath on 10 October. However, he was blamed for conceding Small Heath's only goal in the 1\u20131 draw and he never played first-team football for Newton Heath again. He was released at the end of the season.", "link_mentions": {}}}
