He made his debut 18 months later on 2 September 1939 in a 1\u20130 home win over Chelsea; and it was Done who got the winner, thus opening his account in the same match. This game proved to be the last 'official' game for six years due to the outbreak of World War II; during the war he scored 147 goals in 137 games. Done rejoined Liverpool after the war; after missing the first nine games of the 1946\u201347 season he made an impact on the side by scoring the \"Reds\" goal in their 1\u20131 home draw with Charlton. He then followed this up by scoring his first hat-trick for the club on 19 October 1946 at Leeds Road, his goals, which came in the 29th, 43rd and 76th minute, along with a Jack Balmer last minute strike helped humble their hosts, Huddersfield, by a 4\u20131 scoreline. He repeated this feat, this time at Anfield on 12 February 1947 in a 5\u20130 victory over Grimsby, his goals came in the 24th, 40th and 85th minutes, Willie Fagan scored the other two in the 30th and 32nd minutes. Done's contribution in his 17 league appearances, scoring 10 goals, went a long way in helping Liverpool go on to win the first post-war championship. Liverpool dropped to 14th in 1947\u201348, and Done played just the six games. The club finished in mid-table again in 1948\u201349, with Done scoring 13 goals in 28 games. Done struggled to hold down a place in the Liverpool starting line-up and completely missed out on the 1950 FA Cup run; he scored five goals in 16 league games. He scored three goals in 25 games in 1950\u201351, and got four goals in 12 games in 1951\u201352."]}, {"page": "1937 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||10|| Willie Fagan"]}, {"page": "1950 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|IL ||10|| Willie Fagan"]}, {"page": "William Fagan", "response": ["* Willie Fagan (1917\u20131992), footballer who played for Liverpool"]}, {"page": "1944\u201345 in Scottish football", "response": ["The two teams met again on 3 February 1945 at Villa Park, Birmingham in front of a crowd of 65,780.
