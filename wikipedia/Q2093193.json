He began by repeating Jansky's observations, and then conducted the first sky survey in the radio frequencies. On February 27, 1942, James Stanley Hey, a British Army research officer, made the first detection of radio waves emitted by the Sun. Later that year George Clark Southworth, at Bell Labs like Jansky, also detected radiowaves from the sun. Both researchers were bound by wartime security surrounding radar, so Reber, who was not, published his 1944 findings first. Several other people independently discovered solar radiowaves, including E. Schott in Denmark and Elizabeth Alexander working on Norfolk Island. (see R&E holdings at NLNZ .)", "The Cambridge group of Ryle and Vonberg observed the sun at 175\u00a0MHz for the first time in mid July 1946 with a Michelson interferometer consisting of two radio antennas with spacings of some tens of meters up to 240 meters. They showed that the radio radiation was smaller than 10 arc minutes in size and also detected circular polarization in the Type I bursts. Two other groups had also detected circular polarization at about the same time (David Martyn in Australia and Edward Appleton with James Stanley Hey in the UK)."]}, {"page": "1942 in science", "response": ["* February 27 \u2013 James Stanley Hey, a British Army research officer, first detects radio waves emitted by the sun, helping to pioneer radio astronomy."]}, {"page": "1942 in radio", "response": ["*27 February \u2013 James Stanley Hey, a British Army research officer, helps develop radio astronomy, when he discovers that the sun emits radio waves."]}, {"page": "Meanings of minor planet names: 22001\u201323000", "response": ["| 22473 Stanleyhey ||  || James Stanley Hey (1909\u20132000), a British radar engineer. || "]}, {"page": "Meteor burst communications", "response": ["The earliest direct observation of interaction between meteors and radio propagation was reported in 1929 by Hantaro Nagaoka of Japan. In 1931, Greenleaf Pickard noticed that bursts of long-distance propagation occurred at times of major meteor showers. At the same time, Bell Labs researcher A. M. Skellett was studying ways to improve night-time radio propagation, and suggested that the oddities that many researchers were seeing were due to meteors. The next year Schafer and Goodall noted that the atmosphere was disturbed during that year's Leonid meteor shower, prompting Skellett to postulate that the mechanism was reflection or scattering from electrons in meteor trails. In 1944, while researching a radar system that was \"pointed up\" to detect the V-2 missiles falling on London, James Stanley Hey confirmed that the meteor trails were in fact reflecting radio signals."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| James Stanley Hey||16/03/1978||4 May 1909 \u2013 27 February 2000"]}, {"page": "J.S.
