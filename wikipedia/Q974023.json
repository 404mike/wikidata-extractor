The Tribunal was established on the basis of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter; the relevant portion of which reads \"the Security Council can take measures to maintain or restore international peace and security\".For more detail, see an early summary of this argument by Mak, T.: Case Against an International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, (1995) International Peacekeeping, 2:4, 536-563. The legal criticism has been succinctly stated in a memorandum issued by Austrian Professor Hans K\u00f6chler, which was submitted to the President of the Security Council in 1999. British Conservative Party MEP Daniel Hannan has called for the court to be abolished, claiming it is anti-democratic and a violation of national sovereignty."]}, {"page": "Conservative Party (UK)", "response": ["The \"free-market wing\" of economic liberals achieved dominance after the election of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1975. Their goal was to reduce the role of the government in the economy and to this end, they supported cuts in direct taxation, the privatisation of nationalised industries and a reduction in the size and scope of the welfare state. Supporters of the \"free-market wing\" have been labelled as \"Thatcherites\". The group has disparate views of social policy: Thatcher herself was socially conservative and a practising Anglican but the free-market wing in the Conservative Party harbour a range of social opinions from the civil libertarian views of Michael Portillo, Daniel Hannan, and David Davis to the traditional conservatism of former party leaders William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. The Thatcherite wing is also associated with the concept of a \"classless society\"."]}, {"page": "Tony Benn", "response": ["In 1991, Benn reiterated his opposition to the European Commission and highlighted an alleged democratic deficit in the institution, saying: \"Some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the British Government, but we shall get it from Jacques Delors. They believe that a good king is better than a bad Parliament. I have never taken that view.\" This argument has also been used by many on the right-wing Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, such as Daniel Hannan MEP. Jonathan Freedland writes in The Guardian that \"For [Tony Benn], even benign rule by a monarch was worthless because the king's whim could change and there'd be nothing you could do about it.\""]}, {"page": "West Lothian question", "response": ["Douglas Carswell and Daniel Hannan have proposed that all the powers currently devolved to the Scottish Parliament should also be devolved to the English counties and cities. This would mean that the situation of Scottish MPs voting on policy which only affected England would no longer arise, because parliament would no longer be responsible for areas of policy which affected only England. Therefore, parliament would have to choose to make policy either for the United Kingdom as a whole, or not at all."]}, {"page": "Whittaker Chambers", "response": ["* Daniel Hannan: On March 16, 2017, the first recipient was Daniel Hannan MEP, dubbed \"the man who brought you Brexit\" by The Guardian.
