He was more comfortable as a centre-back, but could also play as a full-back. He scored eight goals in 470 league and cup appearances over the course of a 14-year professional career in the English Football League and National League.\nHe graduated through the Wolverhampton Wanderers Academy to turn professional in February 2007. He spent much of the 2007\u201308 season on loan at Hereford United, helping the club to win promotion into League One. He joined Port Vale on loan at the start of the 2008\u201309 season, and his loan stay was made permanent in January 2009. He played 53 games for the club in 2009\u201310, and continued to be a key member of the defence in 2010\u201311. He joined Championship club Barnsley on loan in March 2012, with a view to a permanent deal in the summer. From Barnsley, he was loaned out to Shrewsbury Town in September 2012.\nHe moved back into League Two with Northampton Town in February 2013, and spent over two years with the club before moving on to Mansfield Town; he captained both Northampton and Mansfield. He signed with Forest Green Rovers in May 2017 and stayed with the club for two seasons before joining non-League Yeovil Town in June 2019. He served Yeovil as club captain until his death, at the age of 32, in March 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Telford", "response": ["*Lee Collins (1988 - 2021) professional footballer, born in Telford.

However, he lost four of his best players in Lee Collins, Anthony Griffith, Sean Rigg, and captain and top-scorer Marc Richards; all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere, leaving Adams needing to rebuild the team largely from scratch. He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons. Vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion, finishing as the division's top-scorers as wingers Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent provided quality service to prolific striker Tom Pope throughout the campaign."]}, {"page": "Carl Dickinson", "response": ["He was an ever-present for the first 26 games of the 2015\u201316 season before being sent off for an off-the-ball incident in a 2\u20131 defeat at Rochdale on 28 November; earlier in the game he also gave away a penalty though opposition manager Keith Hill admitted Dickinson had made an \"excellent challenge... I think the referee has got that wrong\". Whilst serving his suspension he defended his teammate's from booing, stating that negative fans who booed should \"shut up and get behind the team\". He was offered a new contract in the summer, though the offer included a \"considerable pay cut\". He announced his departure from the club in June 2016.

Three months on from his sacking, the club were yet to reach a compensation settlement with Sinnott, before an agreement was reached in February 2009.

Vale suffered four consecutive defeats, before managing to turn things around by the end of the month with 1\u20130 wins over Rotherham United and Plymouth Argyle. On 14 February, midfielders Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall joined the club on non-contract terms. However the treatment room grew more busy, as Adam Yates and Tom Pope picked up injuries requiring several weeks of rest. The club expected to receive a boost when Trinidad and Tobago international Chris Birchall returned from the Los Angeles Galaxy to play for the club on a month-by-month basis; however the club were hit by a transfer embargo by the Football League on 25 February for failing to pay a bill. Nevertheless performances on the pitch were solid, and Vale entered the Crewe derby having won four and drawn one of their last five games. The derby finished honours even again at 1\u20131, with a late header from Byron Moore cancelling out the own goal scored by Crewe skipper David Artell. A 2\u20131 home defeat by Barnet on 10 March ended Vale's run of eight game unbeaten; combined with a ten-point deduction for entering administration, the club slipped from 9th to 14th in the space of 24 hours. Promising young defender Lee Collins was the first the leave the club post-administration, joining Championship side Barnsley on a loan deal worth \u00a350,000 to the Vale on 15 March. The drama continued in the game against Shrewsbury Town on 27 March, as the match was abandoned after 64 minutes due to a fire caused by the failure of the floodlights at the New Meadow. With the season drawing to a close, Adams began developing his squad for the following season, and announced that he had 'reluctantly' released defender Charlie Raglan, without giving him his first team debut. He offered contracts to all but three players: Chris Martin, Phil Roe, and Paul Marshall; he also placed Burge on the transfer list. Aside from Lee Collins, the first player to reject a contract with Vale to move elsewhere was Anthony Griffith, who signed a two-year deal with League One side Leyton Orient. The first out-of-contract players to pledge their futures to Port Vale were Rob Taylor (two years), Lewis Haldane (six months), Ben Williamson (one year), and Sam Johnson (one year). Days later it was announced that Sean Rigg had signed with Oxford United, whilst Clayton McDonald confirmed that he would accept Vale's offer of a new one-year deal. However the biggest blow to fan's hopes of promotion came when it was announced that talismanic top-scorer Marc Richards had signed a two-year deal with relegated League One side Chesterfield. June began with John McCombe and Tom Pope both agreeing to sign new deals with the club. The only player to reject the club's offer of a new contract despite not signing a contract elsewhere was goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson; he eventually ended up at Burton Albion.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||15||align=\"left\"| Lee Collins", "|15||||DF||Lee Collins||2||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||3||0", "|||Lee Collins", "|||Lee Collins"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On 19 June 2012, Port Vale were given odds of 40 to 1 of gaining promotion.

Four days later, Vale hosted fourth placed Burton Albion, in what was labelled as the biggest game of the season for the \"Valiants\". Reduced tickets of \u00a39 ensured a crowd of 10,978, and they were treated to a comprehensive 7\u20131 victory as Lee Hughes scored a hat-trick. Bottom-placed Aldershot were the visitors four days later, and were seemingly fired up after manager Andy Scott took offense to Adams saying that \"[Aldershot] are down the bottom because [they] deserve to be\"; Scott stated that \"Sometimes managers say things to deflect from what is going on at their own club. We will find out if they have got the stomach for the fight and see if they want to get promoted as they have got a few clubs chasing them.\" The match proved to be low on action, and Vale surrendered a half-time lead to draw the game 1\u20131. On 12 April, it was confirmed that Burge had left the club by mutual consent. Vale could have won promotion the following day, and seemed to have done so after Liam Chilvers made amends for a horrific first half own goal by heading Vale into the lead on 89 minutes; however an injury-time equalizer left the Vale still just short of their final target. Automatic promotion was effectively secured with a 2\u20132 draw against Northampton Town on 20 April, the two unlikely goalscorers were Chilvers and former \"Valiant\" turned \"Cobbler\" Lee Collins. Promotion was confirmed with a 1\u20131 draw with Wycombe at Adams Park on the last day of the season, in what was former favourite Gareth Ainsworth's last game as a player."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 6 || CB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Lee Collins", "| 8 February 2013 || CB ||  || Lee Collins || Barnsley || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2013 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["|LB ||6||Lee Collins || ||"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|6||Lee Collins||CB||||Telford||||86||1||Barnsley||8 February 2013||Free||2015", "| 6 || CB || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Lee Collins"]}, {"page": "Lee Collins (footballer born 1988)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lee Collins (footballer, born 1988)"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|6 ||DF||Lee Collins ||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||2||0", "| 1 July 2015 || CB ||  || Lee Collins || Northampton Town || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2015 || CB ||  || Lee Collins || Mansfield Town || Released ||  "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Lee Collins"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2017 || CB ||  || Lee Collins || Forest Green Rovers || Released || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Forest Green Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2017 || CB ||  || Lee Collins || Mansfield Town || Free || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 National League", "response": ["| Lee Collins"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Forest Green Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2019 || CB ||  || Lee Collins ||  Yeovil Town || Released || "]}]}}
