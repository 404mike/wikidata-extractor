He played for several clubs, including Livingston, Dundee, Celtic, Leicester City and Forfar Athletic. Douglas was part of the Celtic side that reached the 2003 UEFA Cup Final, under the management of Martin O'Neill. He also represented Scotland at international level, playing 19 times between 2002 and 2005.\nIn 2017, Douglas was inducted into the Dundee FC Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Douglas (surname)", "response": ["* Rab Douglas (born 1972), Scottish football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "Luke McCormick (footballer, born 1983)", "response": ["For the following 2007\u201308 season, McCormick started as back-up to Larrieu, but got his chance as number 1 again when Larrieu was loaned out to Yeovil Town. After a 2\u20131 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, McCormick lost his spot to the returning Larrieu, who played in a dozen games before falling ill to testicular cancer again, seeing McCormick become first choice once again. He received his first red card of his career in the 71st minute of a 1\u20130 defeat away to Scunthorpe United, for handling the ball outside his area. Defender Lee Hodges took over goalkeeping duties for the rest of the game, and emergency-loan signing Rab Douglas played the next game, before McCormick re-gained his place in the team, as Argyle went on to finish 10th in the Championship. A 1\u20130 defeat away to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 May 2008 would prove to be his final game for over four years.

He missed an open goal in his debut against Hearts. He redeemed himself in his next two matches, scoring braces against Dundee United and Dundee in consecutive weeks, the latter game including a solo goal where he ran from the half-way line, evaded the challenges of four Dundee players before shooting past goalkeeper Rab Douglas."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Gould", "response": ["He continued as the No 1 under the stewardship of Josef Venglos and John Barnes. During 1999\u20132000 Gould generally remained the first-choice goalkeeper at Parkhead despite the arrival of Dmitri Kharine, and picked up another Scottish League Cup winner's medal when Celtic defeated Aberdeen 2\u20130 in the final on 19 March 2000. Another highlight that season was saving a penalty from Ronen Harazi in a UEFA Cup tie against Hapoel Tel Aviv to help his side progress. However, despite opening the 2000-01 Treble winning season as first choice and playing in the opening 13 league fixtures, Martin O'Neill signed Rab Douglas as a replacement. Douglas soon became first choice at Celtic, although Gould completed his hat-trick of Scottish League Cup winner's medals that season with Celtic's 3\u20130 win over Kilmarnock in the final on 18 March 2001 (Douglas was cup-tied having played for Dundee in an earlier round of the tournament). He also collected his second league championship winner's medal courtesy of his appearances earlier that season.", "Upon losing his first team place at Celtic to Rab Douglas, Gould drifted out of the international scene.

During the 2003 UEFA Cup competition, Celtic goalkeeper Rab Douglas and defender Bobo Balde appeared in twelve matches, which led the team in that category.

This clash was again billed as the \"Battle of Britain\". Before kick off, Gerry Marsden led both sets of supporters in a rousing version of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\". Celtic then started the match on the attack, John Hartson hitting the crossbar after only 12 seconds. Henrik Larsson, in his first match back after recovering from a broken jaw, then opened the scoring after 100 seconds from close range. Emile Heskey equalised for Liverpool on 16 minutes, latching on to a John Arne Riise cross from the left and shooting past Rab Douglas from a tight angle. The match finished at 1\u20131, with the away goal giving Liverpool the advantage going in to their home tie at Anfield.
