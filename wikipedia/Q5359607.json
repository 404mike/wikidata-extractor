Two proposals to reach Barnstaple were put forwards: an east-west route from Tiverton to Bideford, via Mid Devon and Barnstaple; and a north-south route from Barnstaple to Crediton (with access to Exeter along the E&CR). The Tiverton option had Isambard Kingdom Brunel as its engineer, was favoured by the GWR, and had backing from the Five Kings and the Lord Lieutenant of Devonshire, Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue. Meanwhile, the LSWR had long-term ambitions to challenge the GWR's dominance in the south-west, and they backed the rival Crediton option, installing John Locke as its engineer."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Devon", "response": ["* Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue 15 November 1839 \u2013 14 September 1861, of Castle Hill, Filleigh, Devon"]}, {"page": "Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue", "response": ["* Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (1783\u20131861)"]}, {"page": "Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Earl Fortescue", "response": ["He was the eldest son of Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (1783-1861), by his first wife, Lady Susan (died 1827), eldest daughter of Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby.

Having been appointed rector of West Buckland in North Devon, with the encouragement and practical assistance of Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (d.1861), KG, lord-lieutenant of Devonshire, and his son Viscount Ebrington (d.1905), Brereton established in 1858 at West Buckland the farm and county school to supply education suitable for farmers' sons. Earl Fortescue owned much land in the parish but was not patron of the living, and therefore not responsible for Brereton's appointment. The Earl founded at the same time Filleigh School, near his mansion of Castle Hill, Filleigh.Per inscription on north front of Filleigh School The school was soon renamed the \"Devon County School\", and in 1912 was renamed \"West Buckland School\".  The object was to provide a fee-paying boarding school, with liberal and religious education, at fees which whilst large enough to cover the cost of board and tuition and to return a fair interest on capital invested, were at a fraction of what was charged by the public schools. In recognition of his work in Devon, in 1858 Brereton was made prebendary of Exeter Cathedral."]}, {"page": "Vice-Admiral of Devon", "response": ["*Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue 1839\u20131861"]}, {"page": "Bourchier Wrey Savile", "response": ["He was curate successively of Christ Church, Halesowen, Worcestershire, in 1840, of Okehampton, Devonshire, in 1841, and of Newport, Devonshire, in 1848; chaplain to Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue of Castle Hill, Filleigh in North Devon, from 1844; rector of West Buckland, Devonshire, in 1852 (a Fortescue manor); then curate of Tawstock, Devonshire (a Wrey manor), in 1855, of Tattingstone, Suffolk, in 1860, of Dawlish, Devonshire, in 1867, of Combeinteignhead, Devonshire, in 1870, and of Launcells, Cornwall, in 1871.
