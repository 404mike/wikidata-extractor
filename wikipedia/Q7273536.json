C. Wallhead, was a British Member of Parliament.\nBeginning his career as a decorator, Wallhead joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and later became a journalist and lecturer.  A committed opponent of World War I, he was detained in 1917 under the Defence of the Realm Act.\nWallhead unsuccessfully contested Coventry in the 1918 general election for the Labour Party, to which the ILP was affiliated.  He was elected to Manchester City Council in 1919, a position he held for three years.\nAt the 1922 general election, Wallhead gained Merthyr from the Liberals. As the politics of the South Wales coalfield radicalised, this turned into a safe Labour seat, which he was to hold until his death.  He was one of only five ILP MPs to retain their seats in the 1931 general election, after Labour withdrew their support, and initially supported their disaffiliation from Labour.  However, in September 1933 he resigned from the ILP and rejoined Labour.  He died the following year.\nHis daughter Muriel Nichol was also a Labour politician, and served as MP for Bradford North from 1945 to 1950.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Independent Labour Party", "response": ["In addition to cutting its ties with the Second International, the 1920 Annual Conference of the ILP directed its executive to contact the Swiss Socialist Party with a view to establishing an all-inclusive international which would join the internationalist left-wing socialist parties with their revolutionary socialist brethren of the new Moscow international. In a letter dated 21 May 1920, ILP chairman Richard Wallhead and National Council member Clifford Allen asked a further set of questions of the Comintern. The Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) was asked for its positions on such matters as demands for rigid adherence to its programme, applicability of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Soviet system to Great Britain, and its view on the necessity of armed force as a universal principle.R.
