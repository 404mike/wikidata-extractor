Early folklorists, among them Alice Gomme in Britain and William Wells Newell in the United States, felt a need to capture the unstructured and unsupervised street life and activities of children before it was lost. This fear proved to be unfounded. In a comparison of any modern school playground during recess and the painting of \"Children's Games\" by Pieter Breugel the Elder we can see that the activity level is similar, and many of the games from the 1560 painting are recognizable and comparable to modern variations still played today."]}, {"page": "Hangman (game)", "response": ["Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894 called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes.

Joseph Strutt's Sports and Pastimes of the People of England (1801), Robert Chambers\u2019s Popular Rhymes of Scotland (1826), James Orchard Halliwell's The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842) and Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales (1849), and G. F. Northal's English Folk Rhymes (1892) all included singing games.B. Sutton-Smith, J. Mechling and T. W. Johnson, Children's Folklore: A Source Book (London: Taylor & Francis, 1995), pp. 11-16. However, the first studies to focus solely on this area were William Wells Newell's Games and Songs of American Children (1883) and Alice Gomme's The Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1894-8). Both were considered landmark works in studies conducted on respective sides of the Atlantic. Naturally, these studies tended to include many of the faults associated with the gathering of folklore and folk song examples in the eras studied. They have been criticised for focusing on rural society at the expense of urban, and an obsession with recovering what they considered  \u201cauthentic\u201d and original, but \u201cdisappearing,\u201d verse from adults while disregarding contemporary practice by children. Some of these problems were rectified by the work of Norman Douglas, who produced London Street Games in 1916, focusing on the urban working classes.", "Early folklorists tended to reflect contemporary theories and beliefs, including the view that singing games were a form of pagan survivalism, which led Alice Gomme to conclude that \"London Bridge Is Broken Down\" reflected a memory of child sacrifice, or 'devolution', which assumed that children's songs must have devolved down to children from adult culture and did not allow for innovation by children themselves. The origins of most are obscure and have been evolved by children over many generations."]}, {"page": "Ring a Ring o' Roses", "response": ["In 1892, folklorist Alice Gomme could give twelve versions.Opie and Opie (1951), p. 364."]}, {"page": "Stoolball", "response": ["According to Alice Gomme, the earliest references show that the game was called Stobball or Stoball,Gomme, Alice Bertha (1894).

The Oxford English Dictionary considers it unlikely that \"stool ball\" could have been corrupted into \"stobball\".It suggests instead an etymology of the latter word from \"stob\" + ball, where \"stob\" means a stump or stub of wood, and refers to the club used to play the game.\"\u2020 stow-ball, n.\".

Gomme describes various regional variations: In Shropshire, the two players run in opposite directions and compete to be first to reach the starting point; around London, the chase weaves in and out under the clasped hands of the other people in the ring.
