The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it was originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Based on the scientific theories of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Michael Caine, and Ellen Burstyn, Interstellar was released in November 2014 to largely positive reviews and strong box office results, grossing over $700million worldwide. A. O. Scott wrote, in his review for The New York Times, \"Interstellar, full of visual dazzle, thematic ambition... is a sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret.\" Documentary filmmaker Toni Myers said of the film, \"I loved it because it tackled the most difficult part of human exploration, which is that it's a multi-generational journey. It was a real work of art.\" Interstellar was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two scientific papers and the American Journal of Physics calling for it to be shown in school science lessons. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four other nominationsBest Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design.
