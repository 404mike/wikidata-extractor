It attracted the attention of agents and publishers.\nSix of his novels have been shortlisted for the British Fantasy Society's August Derleth Award for Best Novel, and he has won the British Fantasy Award twice, for his novella The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke(2003), and for his short story Whisper Lane(2007).His novel Jack of Ravens was published in the UK on 20 July 2006. It is the first in a new sequence called Kingdom of the Serpent.  The second book, The Burning Man, was published in April 2008. The final book in the trilogy, Destroyer of Worlds, has been published in July 2009.\nThe earlier books include two series, The Age of Misrule and The Dark Age.\nMark has been described as 'a contemporary bard - a post-industrial Taliesin whose visionary novels are crammed with remixed mythologies, oneiric set pieces, potent symbols, unsettling imagery and an engaging fusion of genre elements. The author's ambition is sustained by his invention: his work is distinguished by breakneck but brilliantly controlled plots, meticulous research, deft characterisation and a crisp, accessible prose style.'He also writes historical novels under the pseudonym \"James Wilde\". He announced on Twitter that his novel Pendragon was shortlisted for Best Published Novel in the Wilbur Smith Adventure Writing Award, the result to be announced in September 2018. Chadbourn was a runner-up. But a year later the best-selling adventure writer Wilbur Smith, who established the award, contacted Chadbourn and asked if he would like to collaborate on a novel, as mentioned on both authors' websites. The result, The New Kingdom, is a historical fantasy set in Ancient Egypt and will be published in September 2021.\nIn addition to his novels he also is a scriptwriter for the BBC drama Doctors. In 2014, he announced on his website that his contemporary thriller TV series Shadow State had been optioned by Clerkenwell Films.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glastonbury", "response": ["In a 1904 novel by Charles Whistler entitled A Prince of Cornwall Glastonbury in the days of Ine of Wessex is portrayed. It is also a setting in the Warlord Chronicles, a trilogy of books about Arthurian Britain written by Bernard Cornwell. Modern fiction has also used Glastonbury as a setting including The Age of Misrule series of books by Mark Chadbourn in which the Watchmen appear, a group selected from Anglican priests in and around Glastonbury to safeguard knowledge of a gate to the Otherworld on top of Glastonbury Tor. John Cowper Powys's novel A Glastonbury Romance is set in Glastonbury and is concerned with the Grail. The historical mystery novel Grave Goods by Diana Norman (writing under the pen name Ariana Frankin) is set in Glastonbury just after the abbey fire and concerns the supposed graves of Arthur and Guinevere, as well as featuring other landmarks such as the Tor."]}, {"page": "List of fantasy authors", "response": ["* Mark Chadbourn, (born 1960) author of The Age of Misrule series"]}, {"page": "Virginia Dare", "response": ["* Other authors have given the myth a fantasy twist. In Margaret Peterson Haddix's novel \"Sabotaged\", a girl finds out that she herself is actually Virginia Dare. In Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's 1965 novel Dare, Virginia and the other Lost Colonists are abducted by aliens and settled on a planet called Dare. In 1969, Steve Cannon wrote Groove, Bang and Jive Around, in which Virginia Dare is one of two stewardesses aboard the Statecraft One who engages in a wild orgy with Annette, the foxy adolescent girl from New Orleans, and Estavanico, \"Little Stevie\" to some, the flight engineer. Near the end, in the land of Oobladee, she is eventually magically transformed into a frail, old woman with a cane, who explains the reasons for which she was left to explore much darker horizons, sexually. Ultimately, she falls to the floor as a pile of ashes. Virginia Dare appears in Mark Chadbourn's fantasy sequence Kingdom of the Serpent, comprising the novels Jack of Ravens and The Burning Man with a third yet to be published. She is kidnapped along with the other Roanoke colonists and taken to the Celtic Otherworld, the home of all myth and legend. She plays a key role in the final volume of the trilogy. A woman named Virginia Dare appears in Gregory Keyes' fantasy novel The Briar King. Keyes uses several hints and word clues to indicate this character is meant to be the historical figure. In Volume I of Tales of the Slayer, a horror story collection set in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer universe, Virginia Dare appears as the vampire slayer \"White Doe\", an English girl adopted by the Croatoan Indians. She is turned into a white doe by a wizard of the tribe when she rejects his advances.
