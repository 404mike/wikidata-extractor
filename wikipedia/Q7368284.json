Wallis, and Robert Dench and Rosemarie Stewart\u2014created one-fourth of the dances used in International Skating Union (ISU) competitions by 2006. In 1933, the Westminster Skating Club conducted a competition encouraging the creation of new dances.Hines (2006), pp. 123\u2013124 Beginning in the mid-1930s, national organizations began to introduce skating proficiency tests in set-pattern dances, improve the judging of dance tests, and oversee competitions. The first national competitions occurred in England in 1934, Canada in 1935, the U.S. in 1936, and Austria in 1937. These competitions included one or more compulsory dances, the original dance, and the free dance.Hines (2011), p. 102 By the late 1930s, ice dancers swelled memberships in skating clubs throughout the world, and in Hines' words \"became the backbone of skating clubs\"."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1936 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|align=left| Rosemarie StewartErnest Yates"]}, {"page": "Dench", "response": ["*Rosemarie Dench (born Rosemarie Stewart, 1914\u20132001), English pair skater"]}, {"page": "Figure skating at the 1936 Winter Olympics \u2013 Pairs", "response": ["| Rosemarie Stewart / Ernest Yates ||  ||9.0||102.5"]}, {"page": "Rosemarie Dench", "response": ["#REDIRECTRosemarie Stewart"]}, {"page": "Rosemarie Stewart Dench", "response": ["#REDIRECTRosemarie Stewart"]}, {"page": "Ice-Capades Revue", "response": ["*Rosemarie Stewart as Ice-Capades Skater "]}]}}
