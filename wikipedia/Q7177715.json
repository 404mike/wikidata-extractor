Following early line-ups with different guitarists and drummers, Liam \"Skin\" Tyson (guitar) and Keith O'Neill (drums) joined Cast in 1993.", "The band re-formed in November 2010 and released their fifth album Troubled Times in November 2011. Bassist Peter Wilkinson confirmed his departure from the band in March 2015, after abruptly leaving a previous tour in December 2014. He was replaced on that tour and in the band by Power's frequent collaborator Jay Lewis, who would also feature on their sixth album Kicking Up the Dust, which was released on 21 April 2017.", "Having switched from bass to rhythm guitar whilst residing at Brucklay House \u2013 a near derelict squat in Mossley Hill, where the seeds of legendary dance label 3 Beat Records were sown, Power began jamming with friends and with an ever-changing line-up began to form Cast. The first addition to the band was ex-Shack bassist Peter Wilkinson who had seen Power performing acoustically at a free festival in Liverpool, and who Power had seen around town.\". Embryonic lineups of the band, featuring several guitarists including Ged Malley, ex-La's members Barry Sutton and Cammy and drummer Russell Brady started gigging in mid 1992 and supported the likes of Pele and The Stairs. Power would later state that he was never happy with these lineups. Unhappy with the band and the demos recorded with Who sound engineer Bob Pridden, he split the band up and extricated himself from his Go! Discs contract in Summer 1993, with whom he was still signed to following his departure from The La's and set about forming a new lineup with Wilkinson.", "Power began writing in early 2000 for the follow-up, Beetroot, released July 2001. Although the band were initially set to work with John Leckie, Power met producer and programmer Tristin Norwell who he was interested in working with, as he was \"up on now, the sounds of now and someone who I can talk to with an acoustic\". The pair worked on the album together for 3 months before moving to another studio, where other members of the band contributed. Bassist Peter Wilkinson was not present for much of the recording due to the birth of his son, guitarist Skin Tyson mostly featured only as rhythm guitarist and most of the drums were cut up and looped. The album was based largely on loops and featured heavy use of horns and flutes and deliberately moved away from the bands guitar sound, as Power claimed the band \"wanted to come back with something that feels fresh and enticing\", describing the material as being groovier and talked of having a desire of \"combining this sort of Marley and funkadelic stuff or Sly and the Family that I\u2019ll get into as much as I get into Townshend and Lennon\".", "Peter Wilkinson, along with the band's live keyboardist Paul Ellison joined Echo & The Bunnymen and appeared on the 2005 album Siberia before leaving shortly after to rejoin the re-formed Shack. In 2002 he released a solo album via The Viper Label under the guise of Aviator with help from O'Neill, Paul Ellison and former La's guitarist Paul Hemmings. In 2003 Wilkinson and O'Neill briefly joined Kealer with Manchester singer-songwriter Jason Kelly and then set to work with ex-Stairs guitarist Carl Cook on a follow-up to the first Aviator album in early 2004 which was seemingly shelved. He then formed the short lived DC-10.", "The band released new song Baby Blue Eyes as a free download on 13 November 2014 from an as yet unrecorded and untitled album due for release in 2015. The band embarked on a UK tour in December 2014, with drummer Steve Pilgrim replacing Keith O'Neill. Peter Wilkinson abruptly left the tour after the first night of the tour in Hull due to \"personal reasons\", and was replaced the following night by former La's guitarist Jay Lewis. Keith O'Neill re-joined the band on the tour on 14 December, following the cancellation of the remainder of Johnny Marr's US tour which he was tour managing. During the tour, Power commented that Wilkinson \"won't be back for a while he has some personal issues\".", "* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass (1992\u20132001, 2010\u20132014)"]}, {"page": "All Change (album)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Mother Nature Calls", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Magic Hour (Cast album)", "response": ["Mike DeGagne of AllMusic gave praise to Power's songwriting being \"way above 1997's Mother Nature Calls\" and his musicianship being \"extremely sharp\" throughout the track listing, while also highlighting Peter Wilkinson's performance as \"more professional and [more] focused\" than with his other bands, concluding that: \"Even though none of the songs can match the strength of \"Guiding Star\" [\u2026] Magic Hour still stands up as the group's second best recording.\"", "* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Beetroot (album)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 bass, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Shack (band)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 bass (1990\u20131991, 2005\u20132006)"]}, {"page": "Michael Head (musician)", "response": ["In 1986, Head formed Shack with John on lead guitar, Peter Wilkinson on bass and Mick Hurst on drums."]}, {"page": "Wilkinson (surname)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson (bass guitarist), British musician", "* Peter Wilkinson (politician), New Zealand politician", "* Peter Wilkinson (Royal Navy), senior Royal Navy officer", "* Peter Wilkinson (SOE), British officer, spy and diplomat"]}, {"page": "Walkaway (song)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "The Viper Label", "response": ["The label has issued archive releases of The La's, The Stairs (including the band's second album), Captain Beefheart, numerous compilation albums, and albums by Stairs frontman Edgar Jones, and former Cast bassist, Peter Wilkinson."]}, {"page": "Slideling", "response": ["*Peter Wilkinson \u2013 bass, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Finetime", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Peter Wilkinson", "response": ["Peter Wilkinson may refer to:", "*Peter Wilkinson (diplomat) (1914\u20132000), British intelligence officer and diplomat", "*Peter Wilkinson (politician) (1934\u20131987), New Zealand politician", "*Peter Wilkinson (priest) (born 1940), Canadian priest", "*Peter Wilkinson (Royal Navy officer) (born 1956), British admiral", "*Peter Wilkinson (bass guitarist) (born 1969), British musician", "*Peter Wilkinson (drummer), British-Australian rock drummer"]}, {"page": "Stormy Weather (Echo & the Bunnymen song)", "response": ["*Peter Wilkinson \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "In the Margins", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Scissors in the Sand", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Alright (Cast song)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Sandstorm (Cast song)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Flying (Cast song)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Free Me (Cast song)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Guiding Star (song)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "I'm So Lonely (Cast song)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Live the Dream", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Beat Mama", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Magic Hour (song)", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "Desert Drought", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 backing vocals, bass"]}, {"page": "On the Corner of Miles and Gil", "response": ["*Peter Wilkinson - bass guitar, vocals"]}, {"page": "Troubled Times", "response": ["* Peter Wilkinson \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Marionette (album)", "response": ["The physical release of the album was distributed through Peter Wilkinson's AV8 label on limited edition CD, cassette and white vinyl."]}]}}
