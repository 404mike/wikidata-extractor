He spent the 2009\u201310 campaign at Conference club Barrow, where he shared goalkeeping responsibilities with Tim Deasy.

After failing to regularly gain first team football, Deasy chose to leave the club at the end of the 2009\u201310 season."]}, {"page": "Chris Martin (footballer, born 1990)", "response": ["Having come through the club's youth set-up, he turned professional at Port Vale in 2007 after spending time on loan at non-league Kidsgrove Athletic. He spent 2007\u201308 and 2008\u201309 as Joe Anyon's deputy, before he won the #1 jersey in summer 2010, having established himself as the club's first choice keeper in the 2009\u201310 campaign. However, he was released after he spent most of the 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312 seasons on the bench behind new signing Stuart Tomlinson. In August 2012, he dropped down three tiers to join Ilkeston. The following year he dropped down another division to play for Mickleover Sports .

Anyon failed to recover for the start of the 2009\u201310 season. New manager Micky Adams looked to sign Stuart Tomlinson in order to have an experienced option in goal, but the cash-strapped club could not afford to offer Tomlinson a permanent deal. However Martin did not disappoint, an assured display against Rochdale was followed by a solid performance in the League Cup at Bramall Lane, where Vale defeated Championship side Sheffield United 2\u20131. Adams commented: \"We knew our keeper would have to have a great night, and what a night he's had.\" However, he was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. He remained the first choice keeper however, his shot-stopping ability, overall competence and reliability making him the star player of the first half of the campaign. In January 2010 he kept three clean sheets in a row, the first time Vale had done so in over three years. His record of conceding just 25 goals in 26 League Two matches by February led the club to promise him a new contract, and led to public praise from teammate Adam Yates. After a run of 38 consecutive games he was rested in February 2010, as manager Adams wished to see Joe Anyon in competitive action. Martin regained his place the next month after Anyon made two costly errors in his seven games. The teenager picked up the Young Player of the Year award for his 47 appearances. He was offered a new contract by the club at the end of the season, whilst Anyon was released. Martin signed the two-year contract, which came with an increase in wages.", "In May 2010, Stuart Tomlinson was announced as his competition for the 2010\u201311 season. Tomlinson said he was looking forward to working with Martin and goalkeeping coach Mark Grew. Martin stated he hoped to be more communicative with his defenders throughout the season. Tomlinson received the nod from Adams, and Martin had to wait until February 2011 for first team football, at which point Tomlinson was out with a hip injury and Jim Gannon was manager. Martin was dropped after conceding a comical own goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to Stevenage, but won a recall the following match as Tomlinson left the field due to a recurrence of his hip injury. The pair continued to battle for a starting place, though Tomlinson supported Martin after he committed another blunder in a 2\u20131 loss at home to Oxford United on 12 March. Over the course of the season he was restricted to just fourteen league appearances by Tomlinson's consistency."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["To begin the final month of 2008, Oldham was at home to play Brighton & Hove Albion. Oldham started the match quickly when Adam Virgo brought down Chris Taylor in the penalty box, allowing Andy Liddell to convert a spot-kick for a 1\u20130 Latics advantage in the 9th minute. However, Steven Thomson slid a ball past the Oldham defence to Glenn Murray who fired a shot into the roof of the net, putting the Seagulls back level at 1\u20131. Adam Virgo, who received a yellow card for his tackle of Taylor, received a second in the 48th minute and was sent off. Despite having only ten men, the Brighton defence frustrated the Latics, holding on for a 1\u20131 draw. A week later, the Latics traveled to face Peterborough United at London Road Stadium. This game was again off to a quick start, however, it was the opposition who struck first. A shot from Aaron McLean in the 12th minute deflected off Latics defender Stefan Stam, giving Peterborough a 1\u20130 lead. Eight minutes before the halftime break, McLean extended the lead with another goal with a rebound from a spot-kick, shortly after having another spot-kick saved by Oldham goalkeeper Greg Fleming. After several comebacks throughout the season, Oldham again showed their intentions when Lee Hughes poked the ball into the opposition's net for a 2\u20131 halftime lead for Peterborough. Just before the hour mark, Hughes again scored when he put a loose ball into the net. With several more chances for both sides, the game ended with a 2\u20132 draw. After two consecutive draws, Oldham was set to face Leyton Orient. Despite early efforts from Danny Whitaker and Darren Byfield, Oldham was unable to net an early goal. A Leyton Orient goal looked possible when Adam Chambers got a rebound twelve yards out, but the midfielder sent the ball high over the net. After Byfield was pulled down in the penalty area by Tamika Mkandawire, Andy Liddell struck his 8th goal of the season via a penalty kick for a 1\u20130 halftime advantage. Near the midway point of the second half, Greg Fleming gave Orient a chance to get back on level terms when he fouled Ryan Jarvis in the box. Fleming saved the penalty, but Jason Demetriou scored from a rebound, earning Leyton Orient a 1\u20131 draw\u2014Oldham's third consecutive. Oldham was away to face Crewe Alexandra under new manager Gudjon Thordarson on Boxing Day. Despite struggling with an illness just days before the match, Darren Byfield was named to the starting lineup. Just before the hour mark in the match, Byfield scored his first for the club from a through back from Kelvin Lomax. The win was secured when Lee Hughes curled a ball past Stuart Tomlinson, before Hughes grabbed another five minutes before the final whistle for a 3\u20130 win. Two days after the Boxing Day victory, Oldham faced off against Carlisle United for the final match of 2008. Terrific play from Carlisle goalkeeper Tim Krul kept Oldham out of goal, despite giving the Latics nineteen corners. Neither side had an attacking threat until 17 minutes in when a Reuben Hazell header forced Krul into a saved shot. With nineteen total shots for the Latics, manager John Sheridan was surprised when the game ended in a scoreless draw."]}, {"page": "Stuart Charles Tomlinson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stuart Tomlinson"]}, {"page": "Ross Atkins", "response": ["At the end of the season, Atkins had a clause activated on his contract which extended his stay at Derby County until the end of the 2012\u201313 season.

Atkins started the season as first choice, starting in Burton's opening seven games of season, however he was substituted at half time for Dean Lyness in the Football League Trophy game at Coventry City. After this games, Burton signed ex-Port Vale goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson, with Burton manager Gary Rowett being dissatisfied with the performances of Atkins and Dean Lyness. After Tomlinson started ahead of Atkins in a 1\u20130 win over Rochdale at Spotland on 8 September 2012, Burton assistant manager Kevin Summerfield said that \"the biggest difference for me was that we were playing the game in their half and they were defending corners because he [Tomlinson] can kick the ball so far up the pitch\".

It was on the ten-minute mark where, in Borough's first attack of the game, Andy Drury lashed a strike straight into the top corner of Barrow keeper Stuart Tomlinson's goal. This goal seemed to change the feel of the game, with Stevenage applying more and more pressure until, on 28 minutes, Stevenage midfielder David Bridges was shown a straight red card for serious foul play on Barrow No. 7, Andy Bond.

On 14 February, midfielders Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall joined the club on non-contract terms. However the treatment room grew more busy, as Adam Yates and Tom Pope picked up injuries requiring several weeks of rest. The club expected to receive a boost when Trinidad and Tobago international Chris Birchall returned from the Los Angeles Galaxy to play for the club on a month-by-month basis; however the club were hit by a transfer embargo by the Football League on 25 February for failing to pay a bill. Nevertheless performances on the pitch were solid, and Vale entered the Crewe derby having won four and drawn one of their last five games. The derby finished honours even again at 1\u20131, with a late header from Byron Moore cancelling out the own goal scored by Crewe skipper David Artell. A 2\u20131 home defeat by Barnet on 10 March ended Vale's run of eight game unbeaten; combined with a ten-point deduction for entering administration, the club slipped from 9th to 14th in the space of 24 hours. Promising young defender Lee Collins was the first the leave the club post-administration, joining Championship side Barnsley on a loan deal worth \u00a350,000 to the Vale on 15 March. The drama continued in the game against Shrewsbury Town on 27 March, as the match was abandoned after 64 minutes due to a fire caused by the failure of the floodlights at the New Meadow. With the season drawing to a close, Adams began developing his squad for the following season, and announced that he had 'reluctantly' released defender Charlie Raglan, without giving him his first team debut. He offered contracts to all but three players: Chris Martin, Phil Roe, and Paul Marshall; he also placed Burge on the transfer list. Aside from Lee Collins, the first player to reject a contract with Vale to move elsewhere was Anthony Griffith, who signed a two-year deal with League One side Leyton Orient. The first out-of-contract players to pledge their futures to Port Vale were Rob Taylor (two years), Lewis Haldane (six months), Ben Williamson (one year), and Sam Johnson (one year). Days later it was announced that Sean Rigg had signed with Oxford United, whilst Clayton McDonald confirmed that he would accept Vale's offer of a new one-year deal. However the biggest blow to fan's hopes of promotion came when it was announced that talismanic top-scorer Marc Richards had signed a two-year deal with relegated League One side Chesterfield.
