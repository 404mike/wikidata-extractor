His father died, and he was raised by his uncle  Health issues (a weak chest and a malformed hip) forced him to immigrate, and he settled in Tasmania in 1840, and subsequently acquired extensive pastoral property in that colony, and in Victoria, South Australia, and New Zealand.

He did not engage in agriculture but stuck to the 'raising of sheep' as a 'better paying game'. He introduced the Leicester breed of sheep into Australia. The gold rush further increased his prosperity and meat sales boomed. The money received from his wool clips was lent at high interest to Australian import houses.
