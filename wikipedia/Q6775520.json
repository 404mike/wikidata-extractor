Spider Daleks directly based on the Amblin production concept sketches were eventually used in the comic strip Fire and Brimstone (1997) in which they are presented as a radically different form of Dalek from a parallel universe. The strip was drawn by Martin Geraghty and Robin Smith. In John Peel's novel War of the Daleks (1997) they are depicted as creations of Davros and described as being slightly larger than a standard Dalek, with eight legs emerging from the lower half. They are said to have greater manoeuvrability than standard Daleks, at the cost of being more vulnerable at their joints."]}, {"page": "Tegan Jovanka", "response": ["*\"The Lunar Strangers\" by Gareth Roberts and Martin Geraghty (Doctor Who Magazine 215\u2013217)"]}, {"page": "Vislor Turlough", "response": ["*\"The Lunar Strangers\" by Gareth Roberts and Martin Geraghty (Doctor Who Magazine 215\u2013217)"]}, {"page": "Peri Brown", "response": ["*\"The Curse of the Scarab\" by Alan Barnes and Martin Geraghty (Doctor Who Magazine 228\u2013230)", "*\"Ground Zero\" by Scott Gray, Martin Geraghty and Bambos Georgiou (Doctor Who Magazine 238\u2013242)"]}, {"page": "Victoria Waterfield", "response": ["*\"Bringer of Darkness\" by Warwick Gray and Martin Geraghty (Doctor Who Magazine Summer Special 1993)"]}, {"page": "Jamie McCrimmon", "response": ["*\"Bringer of Darkness\" by Warwick Gray and Martin Geraghty (Doctor Who Magazine Summer Special 1993)"]}, {"page": "Mel Bush", "response": ["*\"Plastic Millennium\" by Gareth Roberts and Martin Geraghty (Doctor Who Winter Special 1994)"]}, {"page": "The Macra Terror", "response": ["All episodes of The Macra Terror are missing from the BBC archives. 38 seconds worth of footage survives from episode 2, mainly focusing on when Ben and Polly are attacked by the Macra.
