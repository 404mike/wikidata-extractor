It was snapped up for a \"preposterous\" price by the Egyptologist Wallis Budge, of the British Museum. Budge's plan to return to the museum with the papyrus was unacceptable to the British Consul and to the Egyptian Service of Antiquities so he resorted to desperate measures. In an elaborate plan involving a crate of oranges, switched trains and covert embarkations including a midnight rendezvous with a P&O steamship, he eventually sailed from the Suez with the papyrus dismembered and disguised as a packet of photographs.Burnett 1985, pp. 1\u20132 He presented his find in 1896 to Frederic Kenyon in the British Museum's Department of Manuscripts. Kenyon reassembled 1382 lines, of which 1070 were perfect or easily restored and, the following year, he published an edition of twenty poems, six of them nearly complete. Some more pieces of the Egyptian fragments were fitted together by Friedrich Blass in Germany and then followed the authoritative edition of Bacchylides' poetry by Richard Claverhouse Jebb \u2013 a combination of scholars that inspired one academic to comment: \"we almost had the Renaissance back again\"."]}, {"page": "Dodona", "response": ["According to Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb, the epithet Neuos of Zeus at Dodona primarily designated \"the god of streams, and, generally, of water\". Jebb also points out that Achelous, as a water deity, received special honours at Dodona.. The area of the oracle was quite swampy, with lakes in the area and reference to the \"holy spring\" of Dodona may be a later addition."]}, {"page": "Oedipus Rex", "response": ["Many modern critics agree with Aristotle on the quality of Oedipus Rex, even if they don't always agree on the reasons. For example, Richard Claverhouse Jebb claimed that \"The Oedipus Tyrannus is in one sense the masterpiece of Attic tragedy. No other shows an equal degree of art in the development of the plot; and this excellence depends on the powerful and subtle drawing of the characters.\" Cedric Whitman noted that \"the Oedipus Rex passes almost universally for the greatest extant Greek play...\" Whitman himself regarded the play as \"the fullest expression of this conception of tragedy,\" that is the conception of tragedy as a \"revelation of the evil lot of man,\" where a man may have \"all the equipment for glory and honor\" but still have \"the greatest effort to do good\" end in \"the evil of an unbearable self for which one is not responsible. Edith Hall referred to Oedipus the King as \"this definitive tragedy\" and notes that \"the magisterial subtlety of Sophocles' characterization thus lend credibility to the breathtaking coincidences,\" and notes the irony that \"Oedipus can only fulfill his exceptional god-ordained destiny because Oedipus is a preeminently capable and intelligent human being.\" H. D. F. Kitto said about Oedipus Rex that \"it is true to say that the perfection of its form implies a world order,\" although Kitto notes that whether or not that world order \"is beneficent, Sophocles does not say.\""]}, {"page": "1905 in literature", "response": ["*December 9 \u2013 Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb, Scottish classicist and politician (born 1841)"]}, {"page": "Cosmo Gordon Lang", "response": ["At the university Lang's tutors included some of Scotland's leading academics: the Greek scholar Richard Claverhouse Jebb, the physicist William Thomson (who was later created Lord Kelvin) and the philosopher Edward Caird. Long afterwards Lang commented on the inability of some of these eminent figures to handle \"the Scottish boors who formed a large part of their classes\". Lang was most strongly influenced by Caird, who gave the boy's mind \"its first real awakening\". Lang recalled how, in a revelation as he was passing through Kelvingrove Park, he expressed aloud his sudden conviction that: \"The Universe is one and its Unity and Ultimate Reality is God!\" He acknowledged that his greatest failure at the University was his inability to make any progress in his understanding of mathematics, \"to me, then and always, unintelligible\".Lockhart, pp. 10\u201313"]}, {"page": "Lorenzo Valla", "response": ["Valla made a contemporary reputation with two works: his dialogue De Voluptate and his treatise De Elegantiis Latinae Linguae.
