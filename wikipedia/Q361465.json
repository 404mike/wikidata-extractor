He initially finds friends in the Branaghs and often talks to his loyal, talking stuffed wolf, Zoltan (voiced by Andy Bradshaw). Vlad eventually discovers that he is to be the \"Chosen One\", the leader of all vampires, who will guide the vampire race to a new destiny. After escaping from Stokely when Ingrid takes over, the Count continues to prepare Vlad to embrace his vampiric destiny which he eventually does. However, he still believes in vampires and breathers co-existing together and does all he can to make this happen. Vlad for a long time only drank soya blood substitute and avoided drinking human blood, something he promised himself never to do. It was only in the fourth season when Erin was on her deathbed and against her wishes, out of love he bit her and turned her into a vampire. After facing her anger and also because of an unsuccessful battle with Malik, Vlad became so downhearted that he did what he had sworn never to do; drink human blood, one of the bottles of blood kept in the Draculas' blood cellar. But he soon reverted to his original way and only drank soya substitute. Vlad still carries out his responsibilities of protecting his loved ones and saved his family from becoming slain by Sethius in the third season, and with Ingrid's help, by Malik and his mother in the fourth season."]}, {"page": "Sydney Rae White", "response": ["She co-formed a band called The Wild Things alongside her brother, Cameron White, and her husband Rob Kendrick.
