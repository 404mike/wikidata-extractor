He is currently living in Camden, London.\nIn late 2007, he formed Vaughan King and his Riff Raff. The band originally consisted of two cellists, a double bass player and the customary instrumentation of drums and guitars.  However, after turning to a more blues inspired set the band separated. His style was described as \"thought-provoking\" and \"having an interesting and clever array of instruments.\" In a 2009 blog, Vaughan announced that plans are well under way for the follow-up to The Triumphant and hopes to release new material by the end of the year. In 2010 he released an EP entitled 'Ballad Of A Poor Man' which was released with an animated video.  In early 2011 it was announced that the band would be known as 'Dirt Diggers' and they would be releasing downloads and demos throughout the year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of music artists and bands from England", "response": ["**Vaughan King"]}, {"page": "Vaughan king", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vaughan King "]}, {"page": "Short Poppies", "response": ["*Lifeguard Pete (played by Vaughan King) works with and picks on Terry.
