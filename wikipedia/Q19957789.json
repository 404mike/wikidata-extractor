His maternal grandfather Reginald Chenevix Trench, who died in the Great War, had a sister Cesca, a Sinn F\u00e9in supporter who was at the General Post Office, Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916. Isabel Fletcher was born in November 1915, shortly before her father's death. Fletcher produced a series of recordings about his Irish forebears for the Irish Life and Lore website.\nDr. John Fletcher, after government service as a research metallurgist at Harwell, became an antiquarian who pioneered the use of dendrochronology in the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art at the University of Oxford, dating medieval buildings, structures, and paintings on panel.Anthony Fletcher was educated at Wellington College from 1954 to 1959, where he was an avid historian, journalist and stamp collector. In spite of his talent, he failed History at O-Level, which he considered \"unpassable\". On leaving school, he read history from 1959 at Merton College, Oxford, where he was a contemporary of R. I. Moore. At Oxford, he was particularly influenced by WG Hoskins.He decided to teach history as a career, and spent three years doing so at King's College School, before becoming a lecturer at the University of Sheffield.  He was subsequently appointed as Professor at Durham University, from where he moved to the University of Essex.  In his final post, from 2000 to 2005 he was Director of the Victoria County History. He was President of the Ecclesiastical History Society for 1996\u201397.J. P. Kenyon called Fletcher's The Outbreak of the English Civil War \"easily the most important book on the Great Rebellion in the past 20 years\".Fletcher's festschrift was published in 2007 by the Cambridge University Press (The Family in Early Modern England, edited by H Berry and E Foyster).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cornish language", "response": ["When Parliament passed the Act of Uniformity 1549, which established the 1549 edition of the English Book of Common Prayer as the sole legal form of worship in England, including Cornwall, people in many areas of Cornwall did not speak or understand English. The passing of this Act was one of the causes of the Prayer Book Rebellion, with \"the commoners of Devonshyre and Cornwall\" producing a manifesto demanding a return to the old religious services and included an article that concluded, \"and so we the Cornyshe men (whereof certen of us understande no Englysh) utterly refuse thys newe Englysh.\" In response to their articles, the government spokesman (either Philip Nichols or Nicholas Udall) wondered why they didn't just ask the king for a version of the liturgy in their own language. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer asked why the Cornishmen should be offended by holding the service in English, when they had before held it in Latin, which even fewer of them could understand. Anthony Fletcher points out that this rebellion was primarily motivated by religious and economic, rather than linguistic, concerns."]}, {"page": "Victoria County History", "response": ["* Anthony Fletcher (General Editor/Director 2000\u20132005)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Wellingtonians", "response": ["*Anthony Fletcher, English historian"]}, {"page": "St Virgil's College", "response": ["* Anthony Fletcher \u2013 former member of the Legislative Council"]}, {"page": "List of United States national amateur boxing lightweight champions", "response": ["* 1977 \u2013 Anthony Fletcher, Philadelphia, PA"]}, {"page": "UK Film Council Completion Fund", "response": ["|| Anthony Fletcher"]}, {"page": "Seminar Studies in History", "response": ["Despite their relative brevity, some volumes have been highly influential in their field, such as Anthony Fletcher's volume on the Tudor Rebellions (1968) which has been through six editions, with the most recent published in 2015.
