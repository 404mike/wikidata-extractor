As his grandparents came from County Donegal, he visited Ireland many times, throughout his childhood, and still has a home there. He trained as a music therapist at the Guildhall School of Music in 1992/93, and from 1998 - 2009 he headed the Music therapy department at Mission Children's Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. In 1969 he formed the Scottish folk group Contraband, who released an album in 1974, then disbanded in 1975. Jackson's brother George (died 1998) was also a member. He became a founding member of Ossian in 1976. He has lived in Ireland since 2009 and works as a music therapist there, while also continuing his concert and teaching work in the US for part of the year.\nOssian disbanded in about 1989, and he continued as a solo artist both as a performer and composer. He became one of the first to compose using both traditional and classical musicians, and his \"Wellpark Suite\" in 1985 was generally acclaimed as a milestone in Scottish music. From 1989 William Jackson released a series of albums on his own label Mill Records, sometimes using ancient texts, and on one occasion a poem by Kahlil Gibran. In 1996, A Scottish Island was commissioned by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. In 1999 he wrote Land of Light and won the Song for Scotland competition with this song. It was performed at Edinburgh Castle on 27 July 2000, and was featured at the 2000 Edinburgh Tattoo. He arranged and performed the music for Battle of the Clans, a documentary on The History Channel. As a producer, he has worked with several singers on the anthology Celtic Woman. Duan \u00c0lbanach was recorded with the Scottish Festival Orchestra, recorded live in 2002, but not released until 2003.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 14", "response": ["*  1955   \u2013 William Jackson, Scottish harp player and composer"]}, {"page": "Tony McManus (musician)", "response": ["* 1996 Inchcolm, William Jackson ", "* 1998 Celtic Experience, William Jackson ", "* 2001 Notes from a Hebridean Island, William Jackson"]}, {"page": "Catherine-Ann MacPhee", "response": ["Ian Green from Greentrax Records heard her at a festival in Dingwall and offered a recording contract. Like her subsequent albums, all of the songs on \"C\u00e0nan Nan Gaidheal\" (The Language of the Gael) (1987) are in Gaelic, and most are traditional. One of the songs is by the Gaelic-speaking folk-rock group Runrig. The backing musicians include Tony Cuffe and William Jackson, both from the group Ossian. Her second album, which is called Chi mi 'n Geamhradh after the first song, written by Calum and Rory MacDonald of Runrig, contains mostly traditional songs, though it has been described as \"containing a bewildering range [in whose opinion?] of pop and New Age influences including drum machine, harp and bass guitar\". It was probably the first time that \"waulking songs\" (work songs for women finishing tweed cloth) were treated this way. The Mrs Ackyroyd Band is a loose association of singers who record perform comic parodies of folk music. In 1987 they undertook their only non-comic project, a song-cycle called \"The Stones of Callanish\".
