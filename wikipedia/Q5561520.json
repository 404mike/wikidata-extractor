Gilda O'Neill writes in Lost Voices, an oral history of East End hop-pickers: \"I began to worry. Were the women's, and my, memories true or were they just stories? I realised that I had no 'innocent' sources of evidence - facts. I had, instead, the stories and their tellers' reasons for remembering in their own particular ways.'  Duncan Barrett, one of the co-authors of The Sugar Girls describes some of the perils of relying on oral history accounts: \"On two occasions, it became clear that a subject was trying to mislead us about what happened \u2013 telling a self-deprecating story in one interview, and then presenting a different, and more flattering, version of events when we tried to follow it up. ... often our interviewees were keen to persuade us of a certain interpretation of the past, supporting broad, sweeping comments about historical change with specific stories from their lives.\" Alessandro Portelli argues that oral history is valuable nevertheless: \"it tells us less about events as such than about their meaning [...] the unique and precious element which oral sources force upon the historian ... is the speaker's subjectivity.\""]}, {"page": "Category talk:Romantic fiction writers/to do", "response": ["Gilda O'Neill -"]}, {"page": "2010 in literature", "response": ["*September 24 \u2013 Gilda O'Neill, English novelist and historian (born 1951)"]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*24 September \u2013 Gilda O'Neill, writer and historian (b. 1951)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2010", "response": ["* Gilda O'Neill, 59, British novelist and historian, side effects of medication."]}, {"page": "Gilda (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Gilda O'Neill (1951\u20132010), British novelist and historian"]}]}}
