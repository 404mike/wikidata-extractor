The influence of Anna Braithwaite was especially strong. She visited the United States between 1823 and 1827 and published her Letters and observations relating to the controversy respecting the doctrines of Elias Hicks in 1824 in which she depicted Hicks as a radical eccentric. Hicks felt obliged to respond and in the same year published a letter to his ally in Philadelphia Meeting, Dr. Edwin Atlee, in The Misrepresentations of Anna Braithwaite. This in turn was replied to by Braithwaite in A Letter from Anna Braithwaite to Elias Hicks, On the Nature of his Doctrines in 1825. Neither party was persuaded by this exchange."]}, {"page": "Braithwaite (surname)", "response": ["*Anna Braithwaite (1788\u20131859),  English Quaker minister"]}, {"page": "William Forster (philanthropist)", "response": ["Doctrinal differences within the Quakers were created by the views of Elias Hicks of New York.

Instead he turned to poetry, his first publication appearing in 1795.  Soon after he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge and moved in with him, Coleridge agreeing to instruct him in return for \u00a380 a year.  Coleridge's \"To a Friend\" and \"To a Young Man of Fortune\" are probably addressed to Lloyd.  Coleridge introduced him to Charles Lamb, and the two supplied introductory and concluding verses to his next volume of poetry.  A new edition of Coleridge's poetry included poems by Lamb and Lloyd, and referred to the friendship of the authors.  Soon after, however, in November 1797, an author signing himself Nehemiah Higginbotham parodied the three of them (and perhaps Robert Southey) in the Monthly Magazine; this author turned out to be Coleridge himself.  A break followed, but Lloyd still referred to Coleridge as a friend in the preface to his novel Edmund Oliver, published in 1798. The work was, however, taken as parodic of Coleridge and their friendship ended, temporarily also causing a rift between Lamb and Coleridge.  That same year he published a volume of blank verse in collaboration with Charles Lamb."]}, {"page": "Walter Braithwaite (composer)", "response": ["Walter Heurtley Braithwaite (1906\u20131991) was a composer, pianist and teacher.
