He was last seen the previous day by the driver of a taxi which he took to the castle, which was otherwise unoccupied at the time, from Dundee. He was deeply in debt at the time, as his business was not doing well and an Edinburgh company in which he also had large interests, Aitken, Melrose & Co Ltd, had collapsed the previous day. An inquest returned a verdict of suicide. He was 44 years old.\nOn 1 October 1924, one of Stewart's creditors, John Quiller Rowett, to whom he owed nearly \u00a3100,000, hanged himself in his London home.", "link_mentions": {}}}
