He has been described as the \"Prince of Collectors\".Born in England, he spent a number of years in Chile, where he became a successful businessman. He used the money he saved to buy a ship that was specifically built for collecting specimens, and travelled extensively on collecting trips amassing many thousands of specimens. After his death, much of his material was bought by the Natural History Museum in London. A number of species are named after him.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip Henry Gosse", "response": ["In October 1844 Gosse sailed to Jamaica, where he served as a professional collector for dealer Hugh Cuming. Although Gosse worked hard during his eighteen months on the island, he later called this period his \" 'holiday' in Jamaica.\" Gosse's study specialized in birds, and Gosse has been called \"the father of Jamaican ornithology.\" Gosse hired black youths as assistants and especially praised one of them, Samuel Campbell, in his Jamaican books.125, 129. Gosse's insatiable curiosity included trying to eat the birds. On one occasion, he literally ate crow and called the breast \"well-based and juicy\" but \"dark, tough, and coarse grained.\" Several birds collected by Campbell and Gosse in Jamaica are in the collection of World Museum, National Museums Liverpool. For Christian companionship he enjoyed the company of Moravian missionaries and their black converts, and he preached regularly to the Moravian congregation."]}, {"page": "Natural History Museum, London", "response": ["J.

Along with his brother William, George also trained in the trade of plants and the management of nurseries. The family managed special greenhouses and a 9 acre arboretum for tropical plants and were reputed for their collections of palms and orchids. George Loddiges was involved in establishing the Abney Park cemetery garden in 1839-40. The Loddiges worked with plant collectors from around the world as well as botanists. Hugh Cuming was one of their collectors and Nathaniel Ward was a friend. Several species of plant have been named after members of the Loddiges family."]}]}}
