He is noted today as an early pioneer of nautical fiction, particularly for his semi-autobiographical novel Mr Midshipman Easy (1836). He is remembered also for his children's novel The Children of the New Forest (1847), and for a widely used system of maritime flag signalling known as Marryat's Code.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Museum", "response": ["* Large impression of the Buddha's foot made of gilded stone (known as Shwesettaw Footprints) donated by Captain Frederick Marryat, from Ponoodang near Yangon, Myanmar, (18th\u201319th centuries AD)"]}, {"page": "Clipper", "response": ["The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest quote (referring to the Baltimore Clipper) is from 1824.

Conrad's poor health and his unsatisfactory schoolwork caused his uncle constant problems and no end of financial outlay. Conrad was not a good student; despite tutoring, he excelled only in geography. At that time he likely received private tutoring only, as there is no evidence he attended any school regularly. Since the boy's illness was clearly of nervous origin, the physicians supposed that fresh air and physical work would harden him; his uncle hoped that well-defined duties and the rigors of work would teach him discipline. Since he showed little inclination to study, it was essential that he learn a trade; his uncle thought he could work as a sailor-cum-businessman, who would combine maritime skills with commercial activities. In the autumn of 1871, thirteen-year-old Conrad announced his intention to become a sailor. He later recalled that as a child he had read (apparently in French translation) Leopold McClintock's book about his 1857\u201359 expeditions in the Fox, in search of Sir John Franklin's lost ships  and . Conrad also recalled having read books by the American James Fenimore Cooper and the English Captain Frederick Marryat. A playmate of his adolescence recalled that Conrad spun fantastic yarns, always set at sea, presented so realistically that listeners thought the action was happening before their eyes."]}, {"page": "1848", "response": ["* August 9 \u2013 Frederick Marryat, British novelist (b. 1792)"]}, {"page": "1792", "response": ["* February 10 \u2013 Frederick Marryat (Captain Marryat), English novelist and naval officer (d. 1848)", "** Captain Frederick Marryat, British author (d. 1848)"]}, {"page": "Napoleonic Wars", "response": ["*\"Mr Midshipman Easy\" (1836), semi-autobiographical novel by Captain Frederick Marryat, who served as a Royal Navy officer (1806\u20131830) including during Napoleonic Wars, and who wrote many novels, and who was a pioneer of the Napoleonic wars sea story about the experiences of British naval officers."]}, {"page": "Children's literature", "response": ["While Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe in 1719 (spawning so many imitations it defined a genre, Robinsonade), adventure stories written specifically for children began in the nineteenth century.

This idea and the term \"spontaneous human combustion\" were both first proposed in 1746 by Paul Rolli, a Fellow of the Royal Society, in an article published in the Philosophical Transactions concerning the mysterious death of Countess Cornelia Zangheri Bandi. Writing in The British Medical Journal in 1938, coroner Gavin Thurston describes the phenomenon as having \"apparently attracted the attention not only of the medical profession but of the laity one hundred years ago\" (referring to a fictional account published in 1834 in the Frederick Marryat cycle). In his 1995 book Ablaze!, Larry E.
