Fury made a positive impact in his first year at the Wasps Academy. He made his debut for the 1st XV against Bath in January, aged just 18, and playing on the big stage did not daunt him as he went on to appear as a replacement in the Zurich Premiership semi and final.

This prompted the coaches' decision to send him to New Zealand for the summer where he gained more match time and experience playing for Auckland team.\nThe early part of his career was blighted by injuries which saw him briefly loaned to London Welsh to regain match fitness whilst at Wasps.\nFollowing his return to fitness he transferred to London Irish in 2007 in search of regular first team action which culminated in him winning 2 caps for Wales on the 2008 tour of South Africa.  During the 2009 Six Nations campaign Fury was once again called into the Wales squad as scrum half cover.\nShaun Edwards described Wales' scrum-half rookie Fury as \"one of the toughest kids I have ever coached physically and mentally\".On 19 May 2009 it was announced he would re-sign for Wasps.
