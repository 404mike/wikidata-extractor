The majority of the singles were composed by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod. They had four significant hits from these plus a minor hit with one of their own compositions, \"Born to Live, Born to Die\". They had minor hit with \"My Little Chickadee\" in the United States. This was written by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod. There were other titles announced that were either never recorded or were never released. They were \"Our Love Went Thataway\", \"Tear Jerker, Music-worker, You\" which was to be released around the same time as \"Better By Far\" by Lulu and \"No Place On Earth Could Find You\". In 1971, the single \"Stoney Ground\" was released. It is believed that this single was actually by Colin Young and his new backing band Development. It seems quite likely as the Colin Young and Development debut single \"Any Time at All\" pre-dates \"Stoney Ground\". In the mid and late 1970s, there were two more singles released under the Foundations name. They were \"Where Were You When I Needed Your Love\" and \"Closer to Loving You\" which featured the Northern Soul classic \"Change My Life\" as the B side. These last two singles to bear the Foundations name featured Clem Curtis once more as the lead vocalist."]}, {"page": "Tony Macaulay", "response": ["In the early 1960s he worked as a song plugger for Essex Publishing, then moved to Pye Records as a record producer.
