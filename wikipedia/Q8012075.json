Defeated by his Liberal opponent, William Henry Leatham at the 1859 general election both he and Leatham were subsequently found to have conducted extensive bribery during the campaign.", "At the 1859 he was re-adopted as the Conservative candidate but was on this occasion opposed by a Liberal candidate, William Henry Leatham. The polling was very close and when the result was announced Leatham won by three votes, 406 to 403.  Following Leatham's victory, supporters of Charlesworth petitioned Parliament for the election to be declared void.  Parliament's General Committee on Elections reported on 27 July that the election was void and that Leatham was, via his agents, guilty of bribery.  The committee also resolved \"That there is reason to believe that corrupt practices have extensively prevailed at the last election for the Borough of Wakefield\". As a result of this finding a Commission was established to look into the alleged corruption.  The Commission sat for three weeks between October and December 1859 and found that not only had Leatham conducted bribery on a large scale but so had Charlesworth.  Leatham was found to have spent at least \u00a33,900 and Charlesworth at least \u00a34,150 on bribing voters.  Charlesworth was also held to have hired several prize fighters for the dual purposes of exerting an improper influence on the election and causing intimidation to voters supporting Leatham.  Between them, the two candidates bribed 142 of the 866 electors of the borough.  No criminal proceedings followed but it ended Charlesworth's political career and the borough of Wakefield did not elect another MP until 1862."]}, {"page": "Wentbridge House Hotel", "response": ["Edmund Ernest Leatham was born in 1847 in Yorkshire.
