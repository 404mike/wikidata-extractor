He also played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1891-1900) and an XI of Yorkshire (1894).\nHe was born in Berry Brow, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. In 217 first-class games overall, he scored 5,337 runs at 18.72 on the difficult pitches of the time.  He recorded three centuries, with his best a knock of 113 against Somerset.  His other tons came at the expense of MCC (105) and Warwickshire (102*).  He took 49 wickets with his right arm medium pace, at a cost of 28.08 apiece, with his best bowling return of 4 for 40 coming against Sussex whilst playing for the MCC.  He was also on the MCC groundstaff at one time.\nA short plucky man, Moorhouse had the reputation of being a fine cover-point fielder. A product of Armitage Bridge C.C. in the Huddersfield League, Moorhouse was often on the fringes of the Yorkshire side, and sometimes appeared in preference to a better batsman due to his fielding ability.  Subsequently he was coach at Sedbergh School.\nHis brother, Fred Moorhouse, played 117 games for Warwickshire.\nMoorhouse died in January 1921 in Taylor Hill, Huddersfield, at the age of 54.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Moorhouse (surname)", "response": ["* Robert Moorhouse (1866\u20131921), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Huddersfield Cricket League", "response": ["* Robert Moorhouse \u2013 Yorkshire"]}, {"page": "Robert Moorhouse (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Moorhouse"]}, {"page": "Fred Moorhouse", "response": ["The brother of the Yorkshire cricketer Robert Moorhouse, Fred Moorhouse was a professional right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. Having played in single match in 1900 and a few games in 1901, all without achieving any success, Moorhouse became a regular player for Warwickshire over the next six seasons. His best season was 1903 when he scored 336 runs at an average of 21 runs per innings and took 55 wickets at the low average of 15.81. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted his potential: \"He must be reckoned one of the finest all-round players in Warwickshire,\" it wrote. That season saw his best bowling performance when he took seven second-innings Yorkshire wickets for 53 runs, and 11 for 114 in the match at Hull. He had a further 10-wicket match in 1907 against Worcestershire, with figures of six for 43 and four for 88. His batting did not develop and his highest innings came in 1904 when he scored 75 against London County."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Robert Moorhouse (1891\u20131900) : R.
