Standing as Labour candidate for Hampstead, Livingstone was defeated by the incumbent Conservative, Geoffrey Finsberg.

A staunch right winger and free market advocate, she became a bitter opponent of the labour movement and Livingstone. Following the electoral defeat, Livingstone told Socialist Organiser that the blame lay solely with the \"Labour government's policies\" and the anti-democratic attitude of Callaghan and the Parliamentary Labour Party, calling for greater party democracy and a turn towards a socialist platform. This was a popular message among many Labour activists amassed under the SCLV. The primary figurehead for this leftist trend was Tony Benn, who narrowly missed being elected deputy leader of Labour in September 1981, under new party leader Michael Foot. The head of the \"Bennite left\", Benn became \"an inspiration and a prophet\" to Livingstone; the two became the best known left-wingers in Labour."]}, {"page": "First Thatcher ministry", "response": ["|Geoffrey Finsberg||7 May 1979 \u2013 15 September 1981||\u00a0", "|Geoffrey Finsberg||15 September 1981 \u2013 14 June 1983||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Lord Finsberg", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoffrey Finsberg"]}, {"page": "List of government defeats in the House of Commons (1945\u2013present)", "response": ["*24 April 1972 \u2013 A new clause, tabled by the Conservative backbencher Geoffrey Finsberg, to the Housing Finance Bill, which related to service charges for unfurnished lettings, was passed with support of opposition parties by 251\u2013247.
