Tilghman Richards, the newly appointed chief designer of the aviation department of the Scottish shipbuilder William Beardmore, designed his first aircraft for Beardmore, the W.B.1.  This was to be a single engined bomber for the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), which was intended to carry out long gliding attacks to achieve surprise.  It was a three-bay biplane with long span high aspect ratio wings, which were highly staggered.Mason 1994, p.75.

Tilghman Richards, the chief designer of Beardmore, designed a second aircraft to meet an Admiralty requirement for a ship-borne fighter aircraft to be armed with a 37\u00a0mm Le-Puteaux quick firing gun in order to destroy airships.Bruce 1965, p.74. The resulting aircraft, the W.B.V, was a single seater two-bay tractor biplane powered by a 200\u00a0hp (149\u00a0kW) Hispano-Suiza engine.  The wings folded for storage on board ship. The manually loaded Le-Puteaux gun was mounted between the cylinder banks of the V-8 engine, firing through a hollow propeller shaft. Unlike the W.B.V, the W.B.IV was not fitted with a buoyancy chamber, being instead fitted with inflatable flotation bags.Mason 1992, pp.127-128."]}, {"page": "Beardmore W.B.II", "response": ["A two-seat fighter of wooden construction, the W.B.II was built as a private venture by William Beardmore and Company.
