On 19 August, media reports confirmed that the first player to sign for the new-look Giants was Nottinghamshire-born forward David Watts, who had previously played for Worcester Wolves. More signings were later unveiled with Manchester-born players Nathan Schall and Stefan Gill (formerly of Cheshire Jets and Milton Keynes Lions respectively) joining ex-Mersey Tigers star David Aliu and brothers Callum and James Jones (both sons of Giants coach Jeff Jones) in the line-up, whilst Great Britain international Nick George was rumored to be a transfer target. Former Giants star Mike Bernard was also confirmed as a new recruit along with young prospect Devan Bailey, just days before the start of the new campaign. thumb|left|Wright Robinson College arena", "Throughout the 2013 off-season the club announced several new partnerships and projects in the Manchester area, including the launch of a basketball academy with The Manchester College and a development partnership with Stockport Falcons basketball club. The team continued its policy of signing locally-produced players with the unveiling of Keith Page as the team's first new signing for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing Devan Bailey. The roster was also bolstered with the signing of veteran Yorick Williams, a stalwart of the previous Giants franchise, as well as Robert Marsden from Leeds Carnegie, Spanish forward Iker Amutxastegui and French swingman Papis Sambe. Nigeria international Jayson Obazuaye was also brought in by Coach Jones, but his transfer fell through due to the club not receiving international clearance for the player. The team improved on their rookie season performance with a 14\u201319 record during the regular season and qualified for the post-season Play-offs for the first time. The seventh-seeded Giants were drawn in a two-game series against the second-seed Sheffield Sharks in the Quarter-finals. The first game saw the Giants edged out by the Sharks, 60\u201363, at the Wright Robinson College arena, whilst the second game in Sheffield finished in a rare stalemate between the two rivals, ending 78\u201378. Due to Sharks' three-point advantage in the first leg, they advanced from the series with an aggregate score of 141\u2013138. There was some success for the team however, as three Giants players were recognised in the BBL's End of Season awards honours, with David Aliu, James Jones and rookie Robert Marsden all selected as part of the Molten British Team of the Year."]}, {"page": "Mersey Tigers", "response": ["* Devan Bailey"]}, {"page": "List of European basketball players in the United States", "response": ["* Devan Bailey \u2013 Central Connecticut Blue Devils"]}, {"page": "Devan", "response": ["*Devan Bailey (born 1989), English basketball player"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 British Basketball League season", "response": ["|  Devan Bailey"]}]}}
