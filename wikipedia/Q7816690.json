He made his first appearance on his return on 2 December in a 4\u20130 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion. Cardiff were experiencing a poor run of form on his arrival and Curtis suffered defeats in his first four appearances, scoring his first goal since his return in a 3\u20131 defeat against Northampton Town in the third of these matches. Curtis featured in 19 consecutive matches in all competitions following his return, scoring 7 times, and took up the captaincy of the squad after Tom Maidment stepped down from the role. However, he became involved in a dispute with the club over wages and was placed on the transfer list in July 1934 after failing to agree terms. Curtis remained contracted to Cardiff until 1935 but did not feature in a senior fixture after March 1934 and even returned to Birmingham where he began running a pub.
