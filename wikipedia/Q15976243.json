Gatley produced a model of a large bas-relief representing \"The Overthrow of Pharaoh in the Red Sea\", which was highly praised by Gibson. Early in 1855 he was entrusted with the companion bas-relief, \"The Song of Moses and Miriam\". The Pharaoh bas-relief was finished in time for the 1862 International Exhibition, but the 'Song of Miriam' was completed only just before the sculptor's death. In the judgement of Robert Edmund Graves, Gatley's DNB biographer, \"The two bas-reliefs are in strong contrast to each other, the idea of rejoicing being as powerfully given in the one work as is that of fear and impending destruction in the other\"."]}, {"page": "Robert Graves (engraver)", "response": ["Graves's son Frederick Percy Graves was a landscape artist.
