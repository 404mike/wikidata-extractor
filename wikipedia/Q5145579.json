He is a right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper.\nHe made his d\u00e9but for the Scottish cricket team against Surrey on 23 June 1999 and has played for Scotland 119 times in all. This includes three One Day Internationals, his first coming against Pakistan in June 2006. He has also played for Sussex and Warwickshire at second XI level.\nSmith is a police officer away from cricket, affectionately known as 'The Big C' he presently works within the Police Scotland \"A\" Division Divisional Co-ordination Unit alongside one time Shropshire cricketer John J Hampson under the command of Andrew Bradnock. This has interfered with his cricket career on occasion. For example, during the 2005 ICC Trophy he missed the semi-final match against Bermuda as he was required for duty during the 31st G8 summit in Scotland.\nSmith scored his maiden One Day International half-century against Australia in Scotland's opening game of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, but Scotland still lost by 203 runs.\nSmith and business partner Neil MacRae are owners of \"Legends\" cricket equipment company which designed and distributes the \"Katchet\". The Katchet is a fielding aid which mirrors random deflections encountered when the ball deviates after hitting the bat or wicket.[1]", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Somerset Sabres won thanks to a slogging effort by all-rounder Ian Blackwell who rescued them from a potentially dangerous position at Edinburgh.

After winning the toss and choosing to bat, Namibia lost both openers to opposing captain Craig Wright, and after captain Deon Kotze went for a half-hour three, they were 73 for four. Sarel Burger (69) and Gerrie Snyman (41) put on 70 for the fifth wicket, but spinner Ross Lyons got both of them out to end with figures of four for 10 in the first innings, and Paul Hoffmann also got two wickets as Namibia were bowled out for 168. Scotland ended the first day on 95 for three, with Ryan Watson 62 not out. On a rain-shortened second day, with only 48.5 of the stipulated 104 overs bowled, Watson completed his maiden first-class century, with wicket-keeper Colin Smith contributing 70 in a stand of 177. Smith was out shortly before the close of play, and when Neil McCallum and Watson fell early on the third day, Scotland had slipped to 279 for six. However, a partnership of 68 for the seventh wicket between Wright (40) and Dewald Nel (25) helped take Scotland to 360, giving them a first-innings lead of 192. Hoffmann then single-handedly reduced Namibia to 35 for five, finishing the match with figures of seven wickets for 32 runs, and though the lower order briefly resisted, Scotland still completed an innings victory inside three days."]}, {"page": "2001 ICC Trophy", "response": ["| Colin Smith ||  || 326 || 9 || 46.57 || 88 || 0 || 3"]}, {"page": "2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier", "response": ["|Ryan Watson (c)John BlainKyle CoetzerGordon GoudieGavin HamiltonMajid HaqMoneeb IqbalNeil McCallumCalum MacLeodDewald NelNavdeep PooniaQasim SheikhColin Smith (wk)Jan StanderCraig Wright"]}, {"page": "2007 Cricket World Cup squads", "response": ["| 55 || Colin Smith ||27 September 1972 || 11 || Right || Wicket-keeper ||  Aberdeenshire"]}, {"page": "Scottish cricket team in Bangladesh in 2006\u201307", "response": ["* Colin Smith (wk)"]}, {"page": "Indian cricket team in Scotland in 2007", "response": ["| Colin Smith (wk)"]}, {"page": "2007 ICC World Twenty20 squads", "response": ["|| 55 || Colin Smith ||27 September 1972 || 0 || Right || Wicket-keeper ||  Aberdeenshire"]}, {"page": "Colin Smith", "response": ["Colin Smith may refer to:", "*Colin Smith (athlete) (born 1935), British javelin thrower", "*Colin Smith (Australian rower), Australian lightweight rower", "*Colin Smith (British rower) (born 1983), British rower", "*Colin Smith (Buckinghamshire cricketer), English cricketer", "*Colin Smith (religious and hymnodist) (1928-2005), Australian Christian Brother and hymnodist", "*Colin Smith (ice hockey) (born 1993), Canadian ice hockey player", "*Colin Smith (journalist) (born 1944), English journalist and author", "*Colin Smith (musician) (1934\u20132004), English trumpeter", "*Colin Smith (sailor) (1928-2008), Hong Kong Olympic sailor", "*Colin Smith (Scottish cricketer) (born 1972), Scottish cricketer", "*Colin Smith (Scottish footballer) (born 1951), Scottish footballer", "*Colin Smith, lead singer of rock band Mrnorth", "*Colin Smith (English footballer, born 1951), English football defender with Cardiff City and Aldershot", "*Colin Smith (English footballer, born 1958), English football defender with Darlington"]}, {"page": "2009 ICC World Twenty20 squads", "response": ["Colin Smith (wk)"]}, {"page": "2007 Cricket World Cup Group A", "response": ["Australia were put in to bat and made the seventh-highest total in World Cup history,World Cups - Highest Team Totals , retrieved 14 March 2007 It was nevertheless the third-lowest total in Scotland's ODI history and the third time a team had won by more than 200 runs in World Cup cricket.
