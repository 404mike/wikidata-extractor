He was well-placed socially. His religious beliefs effectively prevented him from supporting Charles Darwin's theories after 1859, but Darwin remained a close friend. Wollaston supported the theory that continental lands had once extended outward farther to encompass some of the island groups he studied.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of coleopterists", "response": ["* Thomas Vernon Wollaston"]}, {"page": "Wollaston", "response": ["* Thomas Vernon Wollaston (1822\u20131878), English entomologist and malacologist"]}, {"page": "List of malacologists", "response": ["*Thomas Vernon Wollaston (1822\u20131878) Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Publication of Darwin's theory", "response": ["When Lyell and his wife visited the Darwins at Downe from 13 to 16 April 1856, Darwin explained his theory to Lyell, who then wrote up notes headed \"With Darwin: On the Formation of Species by Natural Selection\", with pigeons as one example.

He was chiefly interested in the Coleoptera. Hope's initial collection of insects included 31 cabinets of varying sizes containing 964 drawers,  store boxes, 1800 books, 249 solanders, and 18 portfolios. He continued to add specimens and books and purchased specimens for the Hope Department, including material from the collections of Edward Donovan, James Francis Stephens, Thomas Marsham, and Thomas Vernon Wollaston. Many are types. He was a founder member of the Zoological Society of London, and in 1833, the Entomological Society of London of which he was subsequently treasurer, president and vice-president at different times.

(2003) The possible cause of extinction of Pieris brassicae wollastoni Butler (Lepidoptera: Pieridae).

The wasp parasitoid was last discovered in the western Canary Islands in May 2006. It uses pieridae as a host and is commonly found where pieridae species are in abundance.
