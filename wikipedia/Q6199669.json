He achieved 5 wickets in an innings (5wI) on 45 occasions and 10 wickets in a match 4 times.\nHe was a tail-end batsman who played 348 innings, with 108 not outs, scoring 2418 runs @ 10.07 and having a highest score of (unluckily) 99*.  He made two fifties and took 128 catches.\nBridges was the bowler when Jack Hobbs scored the run that took him to his 126th career century and so equalled the then world record of W G Grace.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Variations in published cricket statistics", "response": ["On the morning of 17 August 1925, a Somerset v Surrey match was taking place at County Ground, Taunton. Jack Hobbs, 92 not out overnight, turned Jimmy Bridges to leg and completed his 126th first-class century to equal Grace's career record. Percy Fender brought out a wine glass for Hobbs to enjoy a celebratory drink (as he was a teetotaler, it is reputed that the glass contained only ginger ale). As Hobbs had been near to his century the previous evening, the press were present in large numbers. They departed with their stories and on the next day Somerset recovered from a first innings deficit of 192 to leave Surrey needing 183 to win. Andy Sandham, Hobbs' opening partner, was in no hurry and Hobbs reached his 127th and world record century with the winning runs to give Surrey victory by 10 wickets. Such was the unexpected nature of Somerset's recovery that only a small crowd was there to celebrate.", "White's difference is sourced to Somerset v Surrey at Recreation Ground (Bath) in 1920.

In 1919, he came into the Somerset side for the two matches of the annual August cricket festival at Weston, batting at No 10 and keeping wicket. In the second match of the festival, against Essex, he was at the wicket when the ninth Somerset wicket fell with the score at 236 and was joined by Jimmy Bridges, who survived a dropped catch before he had scored. The pair then put on 143 for the 10th wicket in 70 minutes, which remained the Somerset first-class record until broken by Ian Blackwell and Nixon McLean more than 80 years on. The Times reported that the first 50 runs came in 40 minutes, and the second 50 in only eight further minutes. Gibbs' contribution was 41, and he was out, caught by Charles McGahey off the bowling of Essex captain Johnny Douglas, when Bridges had reached 99. Bridges never made a first-class century. In the second innings, Gibbs and Bridges were promoted to bat at No 7 and No 8, and Gibbs made 18 out of a Somerset total of just 84.
