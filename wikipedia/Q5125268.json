The show (originally entitled  Success! and renamed in 2009)  was a backstage musical, loosely based on Faust, and set in New York. Peppered with parody and pastiche, with additional lyrics by Vivian Wadham, its typical, and often cynical, view of the ups and downs of show business was accompanied by a jazzy and sometimes tender score, with Claire Moore, Lon Satton, Kathryn Evans, Jessica Martin and Maurice Clarke forming the CD cast.  The musical was revamped in 2006 and retitled \"Make Me a Musical\".", "By the time Success! made its debut at the Civic Theatre, Rotherham, in September 1995, Taylor had returned to the classics, in the form of Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice. With Claire Moore as Elizabeth Bennett and Peter Karrie in the role of Darcy, the concept album also featured Gay Soper, Janet Mooney, James Staddon and Christopher Biggins as Mr. Collins. Stand-out tracks, according to the Virgin Encyclopedia of Film and Stage Music (VEFSM),  were considered to be \"Through The Eyes Of A Child\" \"Good Breeding\" and \"Thank God They're Married\". Pride And Prejudice was introduced to US audiences, complete with five new songs, by the Public Theatre Company of Peoria, Illinois, in January 1995. Taylor's musical interpretation of the Austen novel was considered to be closer to its source than the 1959 Broadway version (see VEFSM),  First Impressions (Austen's original title for the book), which starred Hermione Gingold. By 2012 there had been more than 30 productions of the show worldwide in the US,  UK, Germany, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Brazil and the USA.", "This production, (with additional lyrics by Eric Vickers), included numbers such as \"Wild Talk Of Vampires\", \"And Sheep Shall Not Safely Graze\", \"Worms Feed On My Brains\" \"Ship Of The Dead\" \"Blasphemy\" and \"Somewhere At The Edges Of Creation\". Once again, the album cast was led by Claire Moore (singer) (as Mina) and Peter Karrie (as Nosferatu), supported by Mario Frangoulis, former pop star Mark Wynter, Barry James, Annalene Beechey and Simon Burke. The world premiere was staged at the Madison Theatre, Peoria, Illinois, in September 1995, and the show had its first European performances a month later in Eastbourne. The work has been translated into German, Spanish and Hungarian.", "Having achieved considerable success with his adaptations on Bront\u00eb and Austen, Taylor looked to William Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, abbreviated to Much Ado (additional lyrics: Vickers). The CD cast included Paul McGann (Benedick), Claire Moore (Beatrice), Simon Burke (Claudio), Janet Mooney (Hero), Barry James (Leonato), David Pendelbury (Dogberry) and Peter Karrie (Don John). Songs included \"If I Could Write A Sonnet\", \"I'll Never Love Again\", \"The Sweetest Kiss\", \"Now I Hear Symphonies\" and \"This Strange Affliction Called Love\" as well as the humorous \"The Officers Of The Watch\" and \"Never Satisfied\". It had its world premiere at Stratford on Avon, birthplace of Shakespeare, in 1996, and had its Continental European premiere in Budapest, Hungary, in 2006.
