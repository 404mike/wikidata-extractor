They also wrote songs together, including \"Le transistor\", a 1961 hit in France for Frankie Jordan, and then worked on the popular radio show Salut les copains. After Jordan recorded \"Panne d'essence\" (a version of Floyd Robinson's \"Out of Gas\") as a duet with Sylvie Vartan, her brother Eddie continued to work with both artists in the early 1960s. He also released records under his own name as a bandleader, and worked with many French singers, notably as the musical director and producer of Johnny Hallyday, who became Sylvie's husband.  Among the musicians regularly used by Vartan was English guitarist Mick Jones, later of Spooky Tooth and Foreigner.   Eddie Vartan became a leading producer in the French y\u00e9-y\u00e9 pop scene of the 1960s, and also produced Nick Garrie's cult 1969 LP, The Nightmare of J. B. Stanislas. As a songwriter, Vartan's successes included \"J\u00e9sus-Christ\", a 1970 hit for Johnny Hallyday. \"Mort d'Eddie Vartan\", Liberation, 23 June 2001.
