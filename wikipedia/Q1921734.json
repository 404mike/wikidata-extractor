He played primarily as a winger, but he also played as a forward.\nHe began his career with Fletcher Moss Rangers, then moving onto Manchester United, and also represented England at under-17, under-19 and under-20 level. He had loan spells with Yeovil Town and Hull City in the first half of the 2010\u201311 season, before he joined Hull permanently for an undisclosed fee in January 2011. After a year at Hull, he fell out of favour and went on successive loan spells to Burnley, Blackburn Rovers, Charlton Athletic and Leeds United throughout the 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 campaigns. He was due to join Leeds permanently at the end of his Hull contract in July 2014, but the transfer was cancelled and he instead joined Ipswich Town. However he made just two FA Cup appearances for the club, and had loan spells with Barnsley and Doncaster Rovers in the 2015\u201316 season, before he was released by Ipswich in August 2016. After trials with former club Charlton Athletic and Port Vale, he signed for Lincoln City in October 2017, but left the club at the end of the 2017\u201318 season. He retired from football at the age of 28.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matty Fryatt", "response": ["He scored his first goal of the 2011\u201312 season against Ipswich Town at Portman Road on 13 August 2011, resulting in a 1\u20130 win. On 1 October 2011 against Cardiff City at the KC Stadium, Fryatt exchanged passes with Martin Pusic down the left before carrying the ball into the box, dropping his shoulder to get past a defender and finishing low past David Marshall at the near post. On 22 October 2011 against Watford at the KC Stadium, an error in the Watford box left the ball loose for Fryatt to fire home from close range. On 1 November 2011 against Barnsley at the Oakwell Stadium, Dele Adebola chested the ball down nicely into the path of Fryatt and the striker fired home into the bottom corner from the edge of the area. On 19 November 2011 against Derby County at Pride Park, Liam Rosenior advanced from right back all the way to the edge of the Derby box before feeding Matty Fryatt. He had beaten the offside trap and finished confidently past Frank Fielding. On 26 November 2011 against Burnley at the KC Stadium, Cameron Stewart received the ball tight to the left touchline, beat Kieran Trippier for skill and pace before crossing low for Matty Fryatt to finish from close range at the near post. A break-away started by Paul McKenna, passed through Robert Koren and fed to Fryatt resulted in the striker blasting home his second goal of the game, although Grant in the Burnley goal will surely have been disappointed with his attempts to keep the shot out. On 3 December 2011 against Leicester City at the KC Stadium, Cameron Stewart's persistence allowed him to poke a ball through to Aaron Mclean and although he should have got his shot away sooner, it didn't matter as he was brought down by Leicester captain Matt Mills. The referee pointed to the spot and the defender was promptly sent off. Fryatt stepped up to take the penalty and confidently beat Kasper Schmeichel. On 17 April 2012, Fryatt got his second hat-trick for the Tigers in the 3\u20131 home victory over Barnsley, the fourth in his overall career."]}, {"page": "Cameron Stewart", "response": ["Cameron Stewart (born circa 1976) is a Canadian comic book creator, who has worked for DC Comics and other publishers.

On 22 October 2011 against Watford at the KC Stadium, Koren picked up possession midway inside the City half, drifted past three Watford players before driving home into the bottom corner of the net from 25 yards. On 29 November 2011, against Southampton at St Mary's Stadium, a flowing move down the left ended with Tom Cairney pulling the ball back to Koren, whose shot deflected off Matty Fryatt and brought a stunning save out of Kelvin Davis. But the rebound fell for Koren, who nodded home from close range. On 3 December 2011, against Leicester City at the KC Stadium, the ball was rolled nicely into the path of Koren and he struck a beautiful shot past Schmeichel from 20 yards. On 7 December 2011, against Birmingham City at the KC Stadium, Cameron Stewart got to the byeline down the right before firing in a vicious cross that was only cleared as far as the penalty spot where Koren readjusted his body to volley into the net. On 17 December 2011, against Millwall at the KC Stadium, a long ball forward was headed down by a Millwall defender and it dropped nicely for Koren, who adjusted his feet well before firing home a low shot from 20 yards out."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|46||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Cameron Stewart"]}, {"page": "Corry Evans", "response": ["On 14 January 2011, he joined Hull City on loan.
