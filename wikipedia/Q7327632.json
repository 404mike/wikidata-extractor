Traditionally, the water-meadows south of Winchester, along which Keats took daily leisurely walks, were assumed to have provided the sights and sounds of his ode. Marggraf Turley, Archer and Thomas argue that the ode was more directly inspired by Keats's visit to St Giles's Hill\u2014site of a new cornfield\u2014at the eastern extremity of the market city. The land, previously a copse, had recently been turned over to food production to take advantage of high bread prices. This new topography, the authors argue, enables us to see hitherto unsuspected dimensions to Keats's engagement with contemporary politics in particular as they pertained to the management of food production and supply, wages and productivity."]}, {"page": "La Belle Dame sans Merci", "response": ["In 2019 literary scholars Richard Marggraf Turley and Jennifer Squire proposed that the ballad may have been inspired by the tomb effigy of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel (d. 1376) in Chichester Cathedral. At the time of Keats' visit in 1819, the effigy stood mutilated and separated from that of Arundel's second wife, Eleanor of Lancaster (d. 1372), in the northern outer aisle. The figures were reunited and restored by Edward Richardson in 1843, and later inspired Philip Larkin's 1956 poem \"An Arundel Tomb\"."]}, {"page": "Aberystwyth University", "response": ["*Richard Marggraf Turley, Professor of Engagement with the Public Imagination"]}, {"page": "Richard marggraf turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley "]}, {"page": "Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry", "response": ["| Richard Marggraf Turley"]}, {"page": "Maargraf turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley"]}, {"page": "Maggraf turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley"]}, {"page": "Margraff turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley"]}, {"page": "Marrgraff turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley"]}, {"page": "Richard maggraf turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley "]}, {"page": "Richard maggraff turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley "]}, {"page": "Richard marrgraff turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley "]}, {"page": "Richard marggraff turley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Marggraf Turley "]}, {"page": "An Arundel Tomb", "response": ["*The male effigy, prior to restoration, may have inspired John Keats's 1819 ballad, \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\", a suggestion made in 2019 by Richard Marggraf Turley and Jennifer Squire."]}, {"page": "Richard Turley", "response": ["* Richard Marggraf Turley (born 1970), British literary critic, poet and novelist"]}]}}
