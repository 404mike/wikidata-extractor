It is based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. Starring Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, Joseph Wiseman, and Jack Lord, it is the first film in the James Bond series, and was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather. The film was produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, a partnership that continued until 1975.", "Broccoli had originally hired Richard Maibaum and his friend Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. They wanted to rewrite the character of Dr. No since they saw him as little more than a \"Fu Manchu with steel hooks.\" An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a marmoset. Mankowitz left the film, and Maibaum then undertook a second version of the story, more closely in line with the novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; she said both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.Johanna Harwood Interview Movie Classics # 4 Solo Publishing 2012", "Category:Films with screenplays by Berkely Mather"]}, {"page": "From Russia with Love (film)", "response": ["Maibaum kept on making rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant was added to the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey; this brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during shooting involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man dead). For the last quarter of the movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice. Uncredited rewrites were contributed by Berkely Mather.", "After the unexpected loss of Armend\u00e1riz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were still to be filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young came up with the idea of moving the Red Grant training sequence to the beginning of the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since.
