The grandson of Denis Compton, he represented England in 16 Test matches.A right-handed top order batsman and occasional right-arm off spin bowler, he made his List-A debut for Middlesex in 2001 and made his first-class debut three years later. A move to Somerset in 2010 saw Compton establish himself as a consistent scorer in a strong top order and following a prolific domestic season he made his England Test debut against India in November 2012.In April 2013, the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named Compton as one of their five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He made a guest appearance for Worcestershire during the 2013 season.\nCompton left Somerset to return to Middlesex at the end of the 2014 season. On 23 June 2016, Compton announced that he would be taking an extended break from the game, following his disappointing performances in the Test series against Sri Lanka. He returned to first-class cricket in August 2016. He retired in 2018.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 26", "response": ["*  1983   \u2013 Nick Compton, South African-English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Denis Compton", "response": ["He was also honoured at the Shenley Cricket Centre, where the main pitch is named the Denis Compton Oval.

ESPNcricinfo's George Dobell noted in their end of season round-up that \"He continues to dominate county attacks in a way that only Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash \u2013 of recent batsmen \u2013 could match. There are times when he makes the bowlers' job appear impossible.\" However, as 2012 \u2013 Trescothick's 19th season at Somerset \u2013 approached, there was talk of resting him from the newly formed one-day cricket championship that following year. Trescothick did not travel with the rest of the side to the Champions League T20 in India. He missed part of the 2012 domestic season due to an ankle injury, and struggled for form going seven four-day matches without a half-century until passing fifty against Sussex in August and going on to score a century. By the end of the season he had played only five one day games, scoring 118 runs at 39.33, two T20 matches making only 31 runs in total, and nine County Championship games in which he scored 506 runs at 38.92, including two centuries. This was his lowest home-season aggregate since 1995. He nevertheless made a statement to the media voicing his wish to continue playing into his forties, and took up a winter commentary stint with Sky Sports to cover England's tour of India. The 2013 season, however, found Trescothick averaging only in the mid-twenties, and failed to score a century for the first time since 1998. He remained, however, the second-highest run maker for Somerset, behind only Nick Compton, and retained the captaincy for the 2014 season. He continued to appear as a commentator and analyst for Sky Sports in the off-season, in particular during coverage of the 2014 World T20. He also publicly lent his support to England's Jonathan Trott during the latter's departure from the 2013\u201314 Ashes series, empathising with Trott's stress-related illness in a statement to Sky Sports which recalled his own experiences, recalling that \"you just can't take any more, you just can't get through the day let alone go out there and play a Test match and win a Test match.\""]}, {"page": "List of International cricket families", "response": ["*Nick Compton"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club", "response": ["During the 2012 season, Somerset were ravaged by injuries to the extent that on two occasions the county were reduced to their last 11 available players, with members of the coaching and support staff having to fill in as 12th men.

Nick Compton carried a batting lineup that at times missed key players such as Trescothick and Craig Kieswetter due to injury, averaging an incredible 99.25. In one-day competitions, Somerset couldn't quite make up for a poor start in the CB40, losing their first 4 games, before winning their next 6 completed matches and narrowly missing out on the semi-finals. In the reformatted t20, Somerset topped their group and won the home quarter-final against Essex to send them on another trip to finals day, only to fall short to Hampshire in the semi-final."]}, {"page": "Middlesex County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*  Nick Compton"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Nick Compton (1983\u2013), England Test cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Durham University people", "response": ["* Nick Compton (Hatfield) \u2013 cricketer"]}, {"page": "Cricket helmet", "response": ["In more recent times, many batsmen have felt that modern helmet designs have become increasingly obstructive.
