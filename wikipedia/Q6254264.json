The capital was undergoing major expansion and rebuilding in the 1860s. Both his brothers Edwin and Theodore were already living there. Before his move he had already been commissioned to design the Quaker-run Alexander and Cunliffe's Bank (1864\u201367) in Lombard Street, City of London, (demolished), Italianate with Gothic features, four-storied of stone.Cunningham & Waterhouse, p. 38 The competition to design the Royal Courts of Justice was by invitation only. It was decided in late 1865 to limit it to six competitors, of which Waterhouse was one. The instructions were drafted in 1866.Brownlee, p. 84 Due to objections the number of invited architects was increased to twelve. But John Gibson dropped out leaving eleven: Waterhouse, William Burges, George Gilbert Scott, John Pollard Seddon, Edward Middleton Barry, the little known Henry Robert Abrahms, the also obscure Henry B. Garling, John Raphael Rodrigues Brandon, Henry Francis Lockwood, Thomas Deane and the eventual winner George Edmund Street. All the competitors chose to produce Gothic designs .Waterhouse's design was based around two large halls that formed a cruciform design. The lower level of the north-south hall was for the general public with short corridors linked to staircases leading to public galleries in the courtrooms. The east-west hall 478 by 60 feet, crossed the lower one at upper level reserved for the use by lawyers. There were four towers the tallest 354 feet in height.Brownlee, pp. 100, 113-114 Waterhouse explained the building's plan:"]}, {"page": "1877 in architecture", "response": ["* October 8 \u2013 John Raphael Rodrigues Brandon, English Gothic Revival architect (born 1817)"]}, {"page": "1817 in architecture", "response": ["* April 15 \u2013 John Raphael Rodrigues Brandon, English Gothic Revival architect (died 1877)"]}, {"page": "Stow Bardolph", "response": ["Holy Trinity Parish Church was extensively restored by John Raphael Rodrigues Brandon around 1850.

John Raphael Rodrigues Brandon's Gothic Revival church has elements of the Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular styles and is \"a building of many quirks\".  It has a nave with a clerestory, chancel and polygonal apse but no transepts, tower or spire: a bell-cot supported on a prominent buttress rises from the west gable.  The walls are of rubble and ashlar.  The scheme of stained glass dates from 1950, replacing windows destroyed by a World War II bomb."]}]}}
