Huddersfield only conceded 28 goals and never conceded more than two per game; the first time a team accomplished this feat. Another notable feat was achieved in October 1924, as Billy Smith became the first player in history to score directly from a corner. After winning successive league titles, Chapman left for Arsenal, which offered to double his wages and attracted larger crowds than Huddersfield.Page (2006), p. 139 Cecil Potter was brought in as his successor. Under Potter, Town became the first club to win three successive English League titles in 1925\u201326. The team came close to winning a fourth consecutive title the following season, but only won one of their last seven matches and thus handed the title to Newcastle United. Town won the \"wrong double\" in the 1927\u201328 season; they finished runners-up in both the league and lost the FA Cup Final."]}, {"page": "Norwich City F.C.", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Cecil Potter"]}]}}
