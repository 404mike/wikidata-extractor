His work was included in the seminal Situation exhibition of 1960 alongside Robyn Denny, William Turnbull and Bernard Cohen among others. This exhibition was a direct reaction by British abstract artists to the recent exhibitions in London of the American Abstract Expressionists in particular the Tate's 1959 exhibition The New American Painting.  Although originally headed for a career in Chemistry, Vaux eventually studied at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1957 to 1960 where he was awarded a Boise traveling scholarship which allowed him to travel in Italy, and later to work at the Jean Ponsa lithographic printing studio in Paris.\nIn 1986, after a long teaching career he was appointed Head of Painting at the Central/St Martins College of Art and Design in London where he stayed until he retired in 1989 to concentrate full-time on painting.\nVaux's work has variously been described as minimalist and constructivist although since his primary interest is in colour and light he has more in common with the American west coast artists than the New York minimalists.\nMarc Vaux said: It [colour] is known to have a direct effect upon the central nervous system/human sensibility, arguably the most effective modifiers of human response, over sound and touch. It is dynamic - dependent on degree of colour, light, surrounding colours. Given the facts it is surprising it has taken so long to come to the position of recognising the effective power of colour alone \u2013 the endless potential of colour alone to communicate, affect and modify response.. it can be a pure visual experience equivalent to any other (experience). The nearest equivalent would be the sound of music. I see no reason why colour can't equate with melody and be as memorable. After all Albers wrote poems to equate with his paintings.A monograph Marc Vaux was written by Vaux's long term supporter Norbert Lynton and published by 21 Publishing in 2005 (ISBN 1872784313).\nThe Tate Gallery holds a good collection of Vaux's work from 1959 to the present day.Vaux's first commercial gallery exhibition was at the Grabowski Gallery in London with his then wife Tess Jaray. He was subsequently represented by the Axiom Gallery, Anderson O'Day and then the Redfern Gallery, since 1998 Marc Vaux has been represented by the London art dealer Bernard Jacobson and has had regular exhibitions there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 29", "response": ["*  1932   \u2013 Marc Vaux, English painter"]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Marc Vaux (born 1932)"]}, {"page": "List of modern artists", "response": ["*Marc Vaux"]}, {"page": "List of contemporary artists", "response": ["*Marc Vaux (born 1932), conceptual, painter, sculptor"]}, {"page": "Vaux", "response": ["*Marc Vaux (born 1932), British artist who rose to prominence in the 1960s"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Marc Vaux (born 1932)"]}, {"page": "Jasia Reichardt", "response": ["* Marc Vaux/Tess Jaray.

Today's city plan of Mannheim is based on a horseshoe-shaped grid of squares referring to Mannheim Castle, starting with A 1 and ending with U 16. The planning of this network goes back to Elector Frederick IV of the Palatinate from 1606 and has been preserved until today. This unique structure can only be compared to the later founding of Manhattan. Galerie Margarete Lauter opened on November 21, 1963, with an exhibition that took place in close collaboration with the Galerie Paul Facchetti, Paris, presenting works of the artists Ger Lataster, Ung-No Lee, Georges No\u00ebl, Rudi Baerwind, and Zoltan Kemeny, and objects of traditional African art. The guests were welcomed at the opening of the exhibition by the mayor of the city of Mannheim and friend of Margarete Lauter, Hans Reschke. Dietrich Mahlow, director of the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, made an introduction to the exhibition. Paul Facchetti from Paris in conversation with the artist Rudi Baerwind. Heinz Fuchs, director of the Kunsthalle Mannheim, a friend of the Lauter family for a long time, chats with the artists.
