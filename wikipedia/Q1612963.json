Formerly, he was a professor of sociology at the University of Pittsburgh, and in 1988 he was the President of the Association for the Sociology of Religion.\nRobertson's theories have focused significantly on a more phenomenological and psycho-social approach than that of more materialist oriented theorists such as Immanuel Wallerstein or Fredric Jameson. For Robertson, the most interesting aspect of the modern (or postmodern) era is the way in which a global consciousness has developed. He lays down a progression of \"phases\" that capture the central aspects of different eras in global history, asserting that the fifth phase, Global Uncertainty, has been reached.\nRobertson's main works are Globalization: Social Theory and Global Culture (1992) and the edited volume Global Modernities. In 1985, he was the first sociologist to use the term globalization in the title of a sociological article. His 1992 definition of globalization as \"the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole\" has been credited as the first ever definition of globalization, though a more detailed analysis of the history of this term indicates it has many authors. He is also said to have coined the term glocalization in 1992.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Globalization", "response": ["Sociologists Martin Albrow and Elizabeth King define globalization as \"all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society.\" In The Consequences of Modernity, Anthony Giddens writes: \"Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa.\" In 1992, Roland Robertson, professor of sociology at the University of Aberdeen and an early writer in the field, described globalization as \"the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole.\""]}, {"page": "Talcott Parsons", "response": ["Parsons became a member of the Executive Committee of the new Russian Research Center at Harvard in 1948, which had Parsons' close friend and colleague, Clyde Kluckhohn, as its director. Parsons went to Allied-occupied Germany in the summer of 1948, was a contact person for the RRC, and was interested in the Russian refugees who were stranded in Germany. He happened to interview in Germany a few members of the Vlasov Army, a Russian Liberation Army that had collaborated with the Germans during the war.Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, \"The Political Orientation of Talcott Parsons: The Second World War and its Aftermath\". In Roland Robertson & Bryan S. Turner (eds.) Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity. London: Sage Publications, 1991. The movement was named after Andrey Vlasov, a Soviet general captured by the Germans in June 1942. The Vlasov movement's ideology was a hybrid of elements and has been called \"communism without Stalin\", but in the Prague Manifesto (1944), it had moved toward the framework of a constitutional liberal state.Catherine Andreyev, Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Movement: Soviet reality and \u00e9migr\u00e9 theories. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.", "Parsons' fight against communism was a natural extension of his fight against fascism in the 1930s and the 1940s. For Parsons, communism and fascism were two aspects of the same problem; his article \"A Tentative Outline of American Values\", published posthumously in 1989,Talcott Parsons, \"A Tentative Outline of American Values\" in Roland Robertson and Bryan S. Turner (eds.) Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity.London: Sage Publication, 1991. \"A Tentative Outline of the American Value System\" was written in 1959 or 1960 and can be seen as a kind of prelude of Parsons' long-term interest in writing a major work about American society and was an attempt to facilitate the theoretical fundament of the concept of the \"societal community,\" which represented the I-factor (the integrative function) of the social system and the extreme importance in the fact that Parsons regarded it as the epicenter (or the logical \"starting-point\") of the general process of differentiation in and of society. called both collectivistic types \"empirical finalism\", which he believed was a secular \"mirror\" of religious types of \"salvationalism\". In contrast, Parsons highlighted that American values generally were based on the principle of \"instrumental activism\", which he believed was the outcome of Puritanism as a historical process. It represented what Parsons called \"worldly asceticism\" and represented the absolute opposite of empirical finalism. One can thus understand Parsons' statement late in life that the greatest threat to humanity is every type of \"fundamentalism\".Talcott Parsons, \"Some Theoretical Considerations on the Nature and Trends of Change of Ethnicity\" in Talcott Parsons, Social Systems and the Evolution of Action Theory New York: The Free Press, 1977, originally published 1975, p. 393. By the term empirical finalism, he implied the type of claim assessed by cultural and ideological actors about the correct or \"final\" ends of particular patterns of value orientation in the actual historical world (such as the notion of \"a truly just society\"), which was absolutist and \"indisputable\" in its manner of declaration and in its function as a belief system. A typical example would be the Jacobins' behavior during the French Revolution. Parsons' rejection of communist and fascist totalitarianism was theoretically and intellectually an integral part of his theory of world history, and he tended to regard the European Reformation as the most crucial event in \"modern\" world history. Like Weber,Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Roxbury Publishing Company, 2002. he tended to highlight the crucial impact of Calvinist religiosity in the socio-political and socio-economic processes that followed.Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, \"Are there Cultural Limits to Inclusion? An Analysis of the Relation Between Culture and Social Evolution in Talcott Parsons' Theory.\" In Gabriele Pollini & Giuseppe Sciortino (eds). Parsons' The Structure of Social Action and Contemporary Debates. Milano, Italy: FrancoAngeli, 2001. He maintained it reached its most radical form in England in the 17th century and in effect gave birth to the special cultural mode that has characterized the American value system and history ever since. The Calvinist faith system, authoritarian in the beginning, eventually released in its accidental long-term institutional effects a fundamental democratic revolution in the world.Letter from Talcott Parsons to Eric Voegelin, May 13, 1941. Talcott Parsons collection, Harvard University Archive. Parsons maintained that the revolution was steadily unfolding, as part of an interpenetration of Puritan values in the world at large.See among others: Talcott Parsons, \"Religious and Economic Symbolism in the Western World.\" Sociological Inquiry, Vol.49.

In Roland Robertson and Bryan S. Turner (ed.) Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity. London: Sage Publications, 1991. He discussed the Kennedy election widely in his correspondence at the time. Parsons was especially interested in the symbolic implications involved in the fact of Kennedy's Catholic background for the implications for the United States as an integral community (it was the first time that a Catholic had become President of the United States).", "As Parsons wrote, \"The deep structures do not as such articulate any sentences which could convey coherent meaning. The surface structures constitute the level at which this occurs.

Structural Sociology New York: Columbia University Press, 1982. p. 53.

Turner (ed.) Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity London: Sage Publications, 1991. but philosophies, art systems, or even semiotic consumer behavior can, in principle, perform that function.Victor Lidz, \"Religion and Cybernetic Concepts in the Theory of Action.\" Sociological Analysis. vol.43.no.4.1982. pp. 287\u2013306.", "Recently, interest has increased in Parsons' ideas and especially often-overlooked later works. Attempts to revive his thinking have been made by Parsonsian sociologists and social scientists like Jeffrey Alexander, Bryan Turner, Richard M\u00fcnch, and Roland Robertson, and Uta Gerhardt has written about Parsons from a biographical and historical perspective.
