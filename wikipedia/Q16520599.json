He is known for his work on \"Systemic Intervention;\" which he defined as \"purposeful action by an agent to create change in relation to reflection upon boundaries.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of business theorists", "response": ["* Gerald Midgley"]}, {"page": "Systems philosophy", "response": ["The third initiative was led by Gerald Midgley, and reflects concerns that developments in philosophy of language, philosophy of science and philosophy of sociology suggested that objectivity in modelling reality is an unattainable ideal, because human values condition what is included or excluded in any investigation (\"content selection\"), and condition how subjects of interest are delineated (\"boundary critique\"). The implication that it may be impossible in practice to obtain objective agreement about the nature of reality and about the \"rightness\" of theories inspired Midgley to develop practices for systemic interventions that could bypass these debates by focusing on the processes involved in making boundary judgements in practical situations. This supports systematic intervention practices that exploit, rather than trying to unify, the plurality of theories and methods that reflect different value-conditioned perspectives. This perspective is grounded in the recognition that values have to be overtly taken into account in a realistic systems paradigm, contrary to the mechanism that is still widely used in modelling the behavior of natural systems. The central text of this approach is Midgley's 2000 book Systemic Intervention: Philosophy, Methodology, Practice.Midgley, G. (2000) Systemic Intervention: Philosophy, Methodology, and Practice. Springer. This approach is now called critical systems thinking (\"critical\" in the sense of \"reflective\"), and is a major focus of the University of Hull's Centre for Systems Studies, of which Midgley is the Director.http://www2.hull.ac.uk/hubs/research/centres/systems-studies.aspx", "* Gerald Midgley (2000) Systemic Intervention: Philosophy, Methodology, and Practice.

Gerald Midgley has argued that the \"DSRP pattern that Cabrera et al. propose is an interpretation imposed on other perspectives, and they are prepared to dismiss concepts in those perspectives that do not fit.\" Midgley argued for pragmatic methodological pluralism against unification, and he advised: \"Rather than seeking to rationalise the systems thinking field, arguably they [Cabrera et al.] would be better off acknowledging that theirs is one perspective amongst many. It is then up to them to argue its coherence and utility while still keeping the door open to insights from other perspectives.\""]}, {"page": "Systemic intervention", "response": ["Critical systems thinking is a systemic intervention's approach in which it is based on the systems thinking framework. According to Gerald Midgley, critical systems thinking is based on three 'themes for debate' for further research which are the improvement, critical awareness and methodological pluralism. However, Flood and Jackson disagreed saying that it should be called 'commitments' instead of 'themes for debate' in which Midgley was against as the word commitment implicates uncritical recognition. 'Themes for debate' explains how there are different perspectives to make it more vital and also critical engagement with various understandings within the research associations. Often referred as desire to change or development, improvement is the fundamental focus for systemic intervention. Improvement can be made by the subjects when ambitions to behaviour or physical transformation during intervention is recognised by the agent. Different stakeholders might have various views on what elements incorporate improvement. Sustainable improvement is when the positive change is made to possible indefinite future without the presence of undesired ramifications. It is important to support the improvement of critical awareness in which will allow the problems of different views on systemic intervention to be identified and also concerns on power during identifying process to be solved. Critical awareness tends to be associated with boundary judgements of what and whose perspectives are to be included in the research for systemic intervention. "]}]}}
