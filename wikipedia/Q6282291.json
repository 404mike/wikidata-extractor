The hospital was mobilised in 1914, but it was felt that because of his knowledge and experience of the Red Cross Society, he could make a greater contribution to the war effort by working in that organisation. He was Red Cross Commissioner for South East Scotland, a post regarded by many as more demanding than an Army command. This involved organising and supervising the many convalescent homes which had been established in south-east Scotland."]}]}}
