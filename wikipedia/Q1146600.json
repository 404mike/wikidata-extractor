He studied in both the UK and France, at the Architectural Association School of Architecture and the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, and returned to work as an architect after serving in the First World War. He rose to prominence in the 1930s, featuring in a book by architectural critic Trystan Edwards and winning the commission in 1932 to design Walthamstow Town Hall, which was eventually completed in 1942. Another civic building of this period was Wiltshire County Hall at Trowbridge. He also designed a handful of private houses, including Pemberley, in Loughton, 1936. He lived in Zoffany House in Strand-on-the-Green, Chiswick, London, from 1936.\nDuring the Second World War, he was appointed one of the Principal Architects of the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). In this post-war stage of his career, he designed several war memorials and numerous cemeteries for the British war dead. Examples of his Commission work are found in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. His work was said to have followed the style of that of two of his predecessors as Commission architects, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. Hepworth, who died in 1963, was described in his obituary as an architect of \"great speed and brilliance\" and \"sensitivity and eccentricity\", influenced by \"classical, English and local Norman styles\".  A number of his buildings are listed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Commonwealth War Graves Commission", "response": ["In January 1944, Edward Maufe was appointed Principal Architect for the UK.
