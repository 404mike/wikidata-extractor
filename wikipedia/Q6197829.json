Rollo started his senior career with Hibernian as an understudy to Tommy Younger. He made two league appearances for Hibs, but left the club after a contractual dispute. Rollo was a baker and confectioner by trade and wanted to continue that, but Hibs wanted him to become a full-time professional footballer.Rollo continued his career in England. He signed for Oldham Athletic, but his time at Boundary Park was hampered by the fierce competition with John Hardie and Johnny Bollands. Rollo was a competent goalkeeper, whose strengths were dealing with high shots and crosses. He spent the 1962\u201363 season mainly in the Oldham reserve team and only made 10 appearances in the promotion winning side. He then moved to Southport, Bradford City and Scarborough.\nAfter retiring as a football player, Rollo moved to Blairgowrie. An accident involving a fork lift truck meant that he had his right leg amputated in 1989. He fully recovered and worked as a scout for Liverpool, mainly covering Highland Football League matches. Rollo died in October 2012, having suffered from cancer for a lengthy period.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rollo (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Jim Rollo (1937\u20132012), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "James Rollo", "response": ["*Jim Rollo (1937\u20132012), Scottish professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Jim Rollo (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim Rollo"]}]}}
