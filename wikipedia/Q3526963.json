Rhodes played in all five Tests and was England's leading wicket-taker with 22 wickets at an average of 15.27.

However, C. B. Fry believed that Hirst was more difficult to play and that while Rhodes bowled well, the Australian batsmen got themselves out as they \"hurried to the other end and tried to hit Rhodes, without success\".Fry, p. 231. Rain meant the game was drawn and washed out most of the second match. In the third Test, which England lost, Rhodes took five for 63, including a spell of four wickets in nineteen balls. In the fourth Test, Rhodes took seven wickets in the match, taking three quick wickets in the first innings, but receiving some heavy punishment. He was batting at the end of the match, but was unable to prevent Australia from snatching victory to win by three runs and take the series. The final Test, at The Oval, was dominated by Gilbert Jessop and Hirst, but when England needed 263 to win in the final innings, Rhodes came into bat after the ninth wicket fell with 15 needed for England to win.

Woods was described by W. G. Grace as being \"not a good scrimmager\", but the England pack during his captaincy was considered one of the country's greatest for decades after. He was known for his strong tackling, described by an 1892 publication, Football, the Rugby Union Game, as \"exceedingly severe\", while Gilbert Jessop joked that an opponent may prefer to be hit by a motor-car than tackled by Woods in a close match."]}, {"page": "Clem Hill", "response": ["The Third Test, the only Test match played at Bramall Lane, saw Hill play one of his finest innings on a poorly prepared pitch that made batting difficult.Roebuck, pp. 79\u201380.

In return Monty Noble and Jack Saunders bowled England out for 145 and Australia led by 49\u00a0runs on the first innings. When Reggie Duff was dismissed in the second innings, Hill joined Trumper at the wicket. The pair scored 60\u00a0runs in half an hour before Trumper was out, caught by the wicket-keeper. He was followed quickly by the captain, Darling, out for a duck. Syd Gregory was the next batsman and with Hill added 107\u00a0runs in only 67\u00a0minutes. In semi-darkness and facing fast and accurate bowling on a poor pitch, Hill pushed on to reach his century after 115\u00a0minutes of batting. He had given two difficult chances, one at slip when 74 and in the outfield at 77 before he was caught by MacLaren from the bowling of Jackson for 119. Australia won the Test by 143\u00a0runs. The final two Tests were thrillers. Australia won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by a mere three runs with Trumble taking ten wickets for the match.

The Third Test, the only Test match played at Bramall Lane, saw Australia win by 143\u00a0runs due in part to a century by Hill and Noble taking 5/51. Darling was dismissed twice by Barnes without scoring, the first Test captain to make a \"pair\". Australia won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by three runs; Trumble took ten wickets for the match.  The last batsman, Fred Tate, came in with England needing eight runs to secure victory. Darling brought the field in and Trumble prevented Rhodes scoring from the last three balls of his over.

Wisden said that he bowled as well as he had in 1901 as he brought about an early batting collapse. Although Australia recovered, he had figures of five for 77. With Len Braund, Hirst then helped England to avoid the follow-on, scoring 43 and according to Wisden \"hitting with the utmost freedom\". Hirst took a further wicket as Australia were dismissed for 121. England, needing 263 to win, were 48 for five at one point but an innings of 104 from Gilbert Jessop gave England a chance. Hirst scored 58 not out, making an aggressive start but slowing down to score mainly from singles in the later stages of the innings as wickets were lost. The ninth wicket fell with 15 needed when Rhodes joined Hirst. It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes, \"We'll get 'em in singles\", but neither batsman could remember those words being said and not all the runs came in singles. The two Yorkshiremen held their nerve to take England to a one-wicket victory. Wisden described Hirst as playing \"a great game\", noted the coolness of his play under pressure and said that \"Hirst's innings was in its way almost as remarkable as Jessop's\".", "After returning to England, Hirst completed another double in 1904. Although a leg injury reduced the pace and effectiveness of his bowling for much of the season, he scored 2,501 runs at an average of 54.36, the highest aggregate and average of his career, and took 132 wickets at 21.09. He became the first Yorkshire player to achieve the double of 2,000 runs and 100 wickets, a feat previously achieved only by the Gloucestershire trio of W. G. Grace, Charlie Townsend and Gilbert Jessop.Thomson, p. 50. Most of his eight centuries were either against the strongest counties or in adverse circumstances for the team.Thomson, p. 51. In August, Hirst had a benefit match against Lancashire from which he received \u00a33,703, worth around \u00a3 as of , a very high sum for a benefit at the time, and his popularity was reflected in the attendance over three days of 78,792 spectators.Hodgson, p. 56."]}, {"page": "Shirehampton", "response": ["*Gilbert Jessop (1874\u20131955), cricketer and later in his life a writer, lived on The Green, Shirehampton, from 1909\u201313."]}, {"page": "List of England Test cricketers", "response": ["The period between 1890 and immediately before the First World War is known as the Golden Age of cricket.

In reality, it was not quite the great age of the amateur related in Cardus's writings. Sydney Barnes (129) became the best paid cricketer by spurning county cricket to play in the Lancashire leagues. However, the sheer volume of greats, that include Jack Hobbs (157), Tom Hayward (97), Gilbert Jessop (122) and Wilfred Rhodes (121) means that the age retains a fond place in the memory of England's cricket fans. It was also an era in which Bernard Bosanquet (137) invented the googly and Tip Foster (138) became the only man to captain England at both cricket and football, and Rhodes, at 30 years, 10 months and 11 days, had the longest spanning Test career of all."]}, {"page": "Gilbert Laird Jessop", "response": ["#redirect Gilbert Jessop"]}, {"page": "Vernon Royle", "response": ["Despite this fairly modest record as a batsman (which was little different from that of several other amateur members of the team), Royle was a member of Lord Harris's cricket team to tour Australia in 1878\u201379, which played one match against Australia. This game has since been recognised as a Test match, the third such game ever played; Royle scored 3 and 18 as the Australians won by 10 wickets, and he also took two catches. In fact, it was Royle's fielding that won particular attention on this tour, and was remembered in glowing terms 50 years later: \"He was ambidextrous, very quick on his feet and smart in return,\" said the obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1930. He is generally regarded as being the greatest \"cover point\" of all time, and many books have described the fear he engendered in batsmen when on the pitch. Only a rash batsman dared to try for a quick run. A remark of Tom Emmett\u2019s, the famous Yorkshire cricketer, is recalled in Royle's obituary in The Times: \"Woa, mate, there's a policeman,\" he said when his partner called him for a short run while Royle was at cover point. In 1919, when The Times was wanting to make a comparison with Jack Hobbs' prowess as a cover-point field, it cited Gilbert Jessop and Syd Gregory, two long-standing and famous cricketers, plus the relatively unknown Vernon Royle, as Hobbs' only equals."]}, {"page": "Jack Crawford (cricketer)", "response": ["Crawford began the tour well, taking seven wickets in the opening first-class match against Western Australia.

Crawford contributed little more with bat or ball in the lead-up to the Test series; in England, the cricketer Gilbert Jessop wrote an article suggesting that Crawford had become an \"unsound\" batsman.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 1080. He scarcely bowled in the first Test, won by Australia, and both the English and the Australian press were critical of his bowling.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 1146.

In A History of Cricket, Altham is more direct in claiming that Palairet should not have been chosen: \"The selectors, it is now agreed, made a questionable choice in preferring Lionel Palairet to an all-rounder such as Hirst.\"Altham, Swanton (1938), p. 245. On his Test debut, Palairet opened the batting and scored six runs in the first innings, one of five victims to fall to Jack Saunders and Hugh Trumble in the first 45 minutes of England's innings. In the second innings, Palairet once again opened, though with a different partner: MacLaren replaced Bobby Abel.
