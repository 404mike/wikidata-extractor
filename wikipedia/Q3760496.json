Other roles she played at this time were Miranda, with her husband as Marplot, in The Busy Bodie by Susanna Centlivre; and Eliza Ratcliff, with John Bernard as Sheva, in The Jew by Richard Cumberland. She also appeared in the pantomimes Oscar and Malvina by William Reeve, in which she also danced; and Brazen Mask by James Hewitt. On 29 April 1811 the Duffs appeared at a benefit in which Mary danced a solo while her husband performed in The Three and the Deuce by Prince Hoare. The latter was so popular that he would go on to repeat this triple-role performance more than eighty times over the course of his career.

Charles Kemble initiated an enthusiasm for Shakespeare in the French: his 1827 Paris performance of Hamlet was viewed by leading members of the Romantic movement, including Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, who particularly admired Harriet Smithson's performance of Ophelia in the mad scenes.Holland (2002, 203\u20135). Edmund Kean was the first Hamlet to abandon the regal finery usually associated with the role in favour of a plain costume and to play Hamlet as serious and introspective.Moody (2002, 54). The actor-managers of the Victorian era (including Kean, Phelps, Macready and Irving) staged Shakespeare in a grand manner, with elaborate scenery and costumes.Schoch (2002, 58\u201375). In stark contrast, William Poel's production of the first quarto text in 1881 was an early attempt at reconstructing Elizabethan theatre conditions, and was set simply against red curtains.Halliday (1964, 204) and O'Connor (2002, 77)."]}, {"page": "Julia Glover", "response": ["As a child, she toured with her father and began taking small parts in plays.
