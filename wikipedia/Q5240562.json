Born at Wells, Somerset, Underdown was educated at the Blue School and Exeter College, Oxford.  The books Revel, Riot, and Rebellion and Fire from Heaven  won prizes from the North American Conference on British Studies and the New England Historical Association.  After retiring from Yale in 1996, Underdown wrote a well-received book about the history of cricket in the Hambledon era, Start of Play.\nAccording to The Guardian:\n\nHis most famous study, Pride's Purge: Politics in the Puritan Revolution (1971), is a narrative of the tangle of events that took place in England during the late 1640s and led to the purge of the Long Parliament and the execution of King Charles I. Almost four decades on, the book remains a fixture of undergraduate reading lists. Underdown went on to pioneer the study of local history, popular politics, gender and sport.Historian Phil Withington argued in 2015 that Underdown's  sense of localism has been superseded by new scholarship, as has his sense of popular culture. The 1985 book on Revel, Riot and Rebellion and The Social History of Politics was an:\n\nearly attempt to ... build a new narrative of popular political participation and activism. But in doing so, it drew a straightforward and somewhat unlikely chain of causality between locale, cultural practices and conflict, and national political allegiances after 1642 \u2013 a chain all the more suspect if the sturdy concepts of localism and popular culture out of which it was forged are found to be a little rusty.  The book now appears to rest on major fallacies and misinterpretations.John Morrill  argues that Revel, Riot and Rebellion received much less enthusiastic reviews compared to Underdown's earlier and later books. He concludes it is book that was either published too early or too late.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*David Underdown (1925\u20132009), 17th-century England"]}, {"page": "Pride's Purge", "response": ["*Pride\u2019s Purge: Politics in the Puritan Revolution by David Underdown "]}, {"page": "Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond", "response": ["* David Underdown, Start of Play, Allen Lane, 2000."]}, {"page": "Guy Fawkes Night", "response": ["Historians have often suggested that Guy Fawkes Day served as a Protestant replacement for the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain or Calan Gaeaf, pagan events that the church absorbed and transformed into All Hallow's Eve and All Souls' Day. In The Golden Bough, the Scottish anthropologist James George Frazer suggested that Guy Fawkes Day exemplifies \"the recrudescence of old customs in modern shapes\". David Underdown, writing in his 1987 work Revel, Riot, and Rebellion, viewed Gunpowder Treason Day as a replacement for Hallowe'en: \"just as the early church had taken over many of the pagan feasts, so did Protestants acquire their own rituals, adapting older forms or providing substitutes for them\". While the use of bonfires to mark the occasion was most likely taken from the ancient practice of lighting celebratory bonfires, the idea that the commemoration of 5\u00a0November 1605 ever originated from anything other than the safety of James I is, according to David Cressy, \"speculative nonsense\". Citing Cressy's work, Ronald Hutton agrees with his conclusion, writing, \"There is, in brief, nothing to link the Hallowe'en fires of North Wales, Man, and central Scotland with those which appeared in England upon 5\u00a0November.\" Further confusion arises in Northern Ireland, where some communities celebrate Guy Fawkes Night; the distinction there between the Fifth, and Halloween, is not always clear. Despite such disagreements, in 2005 David Cannadine commented on the encroachment into British culture of late 20th-century American Hallowe'en celebrations, and their effect on Guy Fawkes Night:"]}, {"page": "Broadhalfpenny Down", "response": ["The 1772 season is notable in English cricket history because it is from then that surviving scorecards are common and three exist of 1772 matches organised by the Hambledon Club which commence a continuous statistical record. Those three matches were all between a Hampshire XI and an England XI, the first played at Broadhalfpenny on 24 and 25 June. The two leading online archives begin their first-class coverage with this match which is numbered \"first-class no.1\" by ESPNcricinfo and \"f1\" by CricketArchive.alt=Cricket pavilion with players watching on a summers day|thumb|Broadhalfpenny Down Pavilion in Summer 2019On 13 July 1775, Small scored 136 not out and Nyren 98 for Hampshire against Surrey at Broadhalfpenny and Small's innings is the earliest known century in first-class cricket.Underdown, p. 112. Despite being ordained, a Steward of the Hambledon Club and a member of the Laws of Cricket committee, the Reverend Charles Powlett was not above gambling on the outcome of matches or of betting against his own team. At one point in the match against Surrey, the situation was such that a Surrey victory seemed certain. Powlett and his associate Philip Dehaney, another Hambledon member, decided to bet heavily on Surrey to win. Then Small was joined at the wicket by his captain Nyren and the two put on a massive century partnership which turned the game around, for Surrey collapsed and Hampshire won a famous victory. When Nyren was out, he was confronted by Powlett and Dehaney who complained that he and Small had cost them their money. Nyren, disgusted with them, retorted: \"Another time, don't bet your money against such men as we are.\"Underdown, p. 118.alt=Batsman hits out in front of the Bat & Ball public house|thumb|Batsman hits out in front of the Bat & Ball public houseBroadhalfpenny Down continued in regular use by Hambledon/Hampshire teams until 1781. At the end of that season, the Hambledon Club moved to Windmill Down, which is closer to the village. According to John Nyren, Windmill was \"one of the finest places for playing on I ever saw\".Underdown, p. 152. A key difference was that Windmill was under the club's control as they rented it from a farmer at ten guineas a year, whereas Broadhalfpenny was common land in use as sheep pasture, for fairs and other gatherings. It could be said that Broadhalfpenny belonged to the community and Windmill to the club, whose members may not have been happy about the \"raucous, boisterous crowds that gathered (on the Down)\". The move was done at the behest of the Duke of Dorset, chief among club members, and David Underdown saw it as the first step in a process which removed professional cricket from a truly rural setting and ultimately concentrated it in an urban environment, for it was Dorset's successors George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and Colonel Charles Lennox who were the key players in the establishment of the White Conduit Club in Islington and subsequently Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's.Underdown, p. 153.", "In 2000, David Underdown visited the ground while researching his history Start of Play. He wrote that \"across the road from the famous Bat and Ball pub [was] a clunky monument and a green field with a cricket pavilion, sightscreens, and a square that bore the scars of recent matches.\" A notice by the pavilion announced that it was the home ground of the Broadhalfpenny Buccaneers.Underdown, p. xv.  In this latter assertion Underdown is slightly mistaken in that the club he refers to is the Broadhalfpenny Brigands Cricket Club, formed in 1959 by a group of officers in the Royal Navy serving at nearby HMS Mercury (now closed). This club has used Broadhalfpenny Down as its home ground continuously since then. The history of Broadhalfpenny Down in the 20th century is covered in Ashley Mote's book \"The Glory Days of Cricket\", which explores the full history of the ground effectively up to the present day (apart from the addition of a new pavilion in 1999 nothing substantial has changed since the first publication of Mote's book in 1997)."]}, {"page": "History of cricket to 1725", "response": ["All acknowledged subject experts and authorities agree that there is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century.Birley, p. 5.Major, p. 17.Underdown, p. 3. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in D\u00e1l Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of \"Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket\". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's br\u00e4nnboll, Italy's lippa, India's gilli-danda, Finland's pes\u00e4pallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined.Altham, p. 20. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.McCann, pp. 37, 121 & 126."]}, {"page": "London Cricket Club", "response": ["* David Underdown, Start of Play, Allen Lane, 2000."]}, {"page": "Billy Beldham", "response": ["* David Underdown (2000) Start of Play, Allen Lane."]}, {"page": "Lumpy Stevens", "response": ["* David Underdown, Start of Play, Allen Lane, 2000."]}, {"page": "Richard Nyren", "response": ["* David Underdown, Start of Play, Allen Lane, 2000."]}, {"page": "Moulsey Hurst", "response": ["This venue is considered to be one of the oldest used for organised cricket.
