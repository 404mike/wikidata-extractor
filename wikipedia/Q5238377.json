He worked on the first implementation of the programming language Lisp.\nHe became an authority on the topics of fairness, program schemas and bisimulation in concurrent computing. At the University of Warwick, he was one of the earliest members of the computer science department, and served as chairperson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of computer scientists", "response": ["* David Park (1935\u20131990) \u2013 first Lisp implementation, expert in fairness, program schemas, bisimulation in concurrent computing"]}, {"page": "List of programmers", "response": ["*David Park (1935\u20131990) \u2013 first Lisp implementation, expert in fairness, program schemas, bisimulation in concurrent computing"]}, {"page": "Hartley Rogers Jr.", "response": ["Rogers is known within the MIT undergraduate community also for having developed a multivariable calculus course (18.022: Multivariable Calculus with Theory) with the explicit goal of providing a firm mathematical foundation for the study of physics. In 2005 he announced that he would no longer be teaching the course himself, but it is likely that it will continue to be taught in a similar manner in the future. He is remembered for his witty mathematical comments during lectures as well as his tradition of awarding Leibniz Cookies and Fig Newtons to top performers in his class. His doctoral students included Patrick Fischer, Louis Hodes, Carl Jockusch, Andrew Kahr, David Luckham, Rohit Parikh, David Park, and John Stillwell. Rogers won the Lester R. Ford Award in 1965 for his expository article Information Theory."]}]}}
