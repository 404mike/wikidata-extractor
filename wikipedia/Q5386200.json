He took only 25 wickets, but that included five in an innings \u2013 five for 64 \u2013 against Worcestershire to win the match where Australian Colin McCool made his highest score in English cricket. Wisden noted that Bryant \"showed promise\".However, he played only a handful matches in the drier summer of 1959 and in his first first-class game of 1960, against Gloucestershire at Bath, he was no-balled five times by umpire Hugo Yarnold for throwing.  Though he reappeared in two further matches that summer without incident, he was not re-engaged by Somerset at the end of the season and did not appear again in first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Eric Bryant (1958\u20131960) 22 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Alan Whitehead (cricketer)", "response": ["He made his debut as a 16-year-old in two end-of-season friendly first-class matches against Sussex in August 1957; in the second of these matches, he played alongside John McMahon, Somerset's incumbent left-arm spinner, who was then sacked by the county at the end of the season.
