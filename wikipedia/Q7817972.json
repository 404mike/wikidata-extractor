The manager fielded telephone calls from the parents of other players who said Bellamy was too small to play in the side. He progressed through the under-17 and under-18 levels before manager Tom Walley called him up to the under-21 side for the first time at the age of 16. He made his debut as a substitute in a match against San Marino, becoming the youngest player to represent the side. Bellamy, however, began to regard the under-21 side as setting him back in his career as he was often relegated to the bench at Norwich after spending up to ten days at a time away on international duty. This led to him asking officials at Norwich to claim he was injured, sparing him from being named in the side."]}, {"page": "Iwan Roberts", "response": ["Roberts credits his school PE teacher, Iolo Owen, as a great influence in his career, introducing him into men's football aged 15: \"He picked me for the school team and got me into the local men's team, Harlech Town... as he was the manager... it toughened me up and made me a lot stronger.\" Critical to Roberts' thinking when he joined Watford was that coach Tom Walley was, like himself, Welsh-speaking, as was professional Malcolm Allen, against whom Roberts had played in the local Welsh leagues. He was also influenced by Graham Taylor's record of giving youth players opportunities. Roberts joined Watford as a trainee, signing his first professional contract in July 1986, shortly after his 18th birthday.", "\"Bruce was very clever: he didn't issue me with an ultimatum, he didn't rant and rave or threaten me. He just said, \"Tom Walley would be proud of you\". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape\u00a0... It was a gentle hint, but I realised\u00a0... I had to sort it out myself.\""]}, {"page": "Jimmy Gilligan", "response": ["Born in Hammersmith, Gilligan later moved to Stevenage. He started his career as an apprentice at Watford after joining the club at the age of thirteen. He was spotted playing for a Hertfordshire FA XI by Watford scout Tom Walley and a Chelsea scout. Both scouts approached his parents, who accepted Watford's offer and he signed schoolboy terms with the club following his fourteenth birthday."]}, {"page": "Arsenal F.C.
