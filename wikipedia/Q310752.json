They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970), and Master of Reality (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes following Osbourne's departure in 1979, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history.", "Following the break-up of their previous band Mythology in 1968, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in Aston, Birmingham. They enlisted bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: \"OZZY ZIG Needs Gig \u2013 has own PA\". The new group was initially named the Polka Tulk Blues Band, the name taken either from a brand of talcum powder or an Indian/Pakistani clothing shop; the exact origin is confused. The Polka Tulk Blues Band included slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips, a childhood friend of Osbourne's, and saxophonist Alan \"Aker\" Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band again changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated) and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke. Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously. Rather than asking them to leave, they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four-piece. While the band was performing under the Earth title, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as \"The Rebel\", \"Song for Jim\", and \"When I Came Down\". The demo titled \"Song for Jim\" was in reference to Jim Simpson. Simpson was a manager for the bands Bakerloo Blues Line and Tea & Symphony, as well as being trumpet player for the group Locomotive. Simpson had recently started a new club named Henry's Blueshouse at The Crown Hotel in Birmingham and offered to let Earth play there after they agreed to waive the usual support band fee in return for free t-shirts. The audience response was positive and Simpson agreed to manage Earth.", "Geezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979 for personal reasons. According to Dio, the band initially hired Craig Gruber (with whom Dio had previously played while in Elf) on bass to assist with writing the new album. Gruber was soon replaced by Geoff Nicholls of Quartz. The new line-up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980, and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by Martin Birch, Heaven and Hell was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release AllMusic said the album was \"one of Sabbath's finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout\". Heaven and Hell peaked at number 9 in the United Kingdom, and number 28 in the U.S., the band's highest charting album since Sabotage. The album eventually sold a million copies in the U.S., and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980.", "On 18 August 1980, after a show in Minneapolis, Ward quit the band. \"It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated\". Geezer Butler stated that after Ward's final show, the drummer came in drunk, stating that \"He might as well be a Martian\". Ward then got angry, packed his things and got on a bus to leave. Following Ward's sudden departure, the group hired drummer Vinny Appice. Further trouble for the band came during their 9 October 1980 concert at the Milwaukee Arena, which degenerated into a riot causing $10,000 in damages to the arena and resulted in 160 arrests. According to the Associated Press, \"the crowd of mostly adolescent males first became rowdy in a performance by the Blue Oyster Cult\" and then grew restless while waiting an hour for Black Sabbath to begin playing. A member of the audience threw a beer bottle that struck bassist Butler and effectively ended the show. \"The band then abruptly halted its performance and began leaving\" as the crowd rioted.", "Following both Ward's and Butler's exits, sole remaining original member Iommi put Sabbath on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While working on new material, the original Sabbath line-up agreed to a spot at Bob Geldof's Live Aid, performing at the Philadelphia show on 13 July 1985. This event \u2013 which also featured reunions of The Who and Led Zeppelin \u2013 marked the first time the original line-up had appeared on stage since 1978. \"We were all drunk when we did Live Aid,\" recalled Geezer Butler, \"but we'd all got drunk separately.\"", "While on his Lock Up the Wolves U.S. tour in August 1990, former Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was joined onstage at the Roy Wilkins Auditorium by Geezer Butler to perform \"Neon Knights\". Following the show, the two expressed interest in rejoining Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current lineup, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. \"I do regret that in a lot of ways,\" Iommi said. \"We were at a good point then. We decided to [reunite with Dio] and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had.\"", "Drummer Vinny Appice left the band following the reunion show to rejoin Ronnie James Dio's solo band, later appearing on Dio's Strange Highways and Angry Machines.

Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song \"Giving Up the Ghost\", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone (\"I heard it's something about me...\" said Iommi. \"I had the album given to me a while back.

Bereft even of reverb, leaving their sound as dry as old bones dug up from some desert burial plot, the finished music's brutish force would so alarm the critics they would punish Sabbath in print for being blatantly thuggish, purposefully mindless, creepy, and obnoxious. Twenty years later groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, and, particularly, Nirvana, would excavate the same heaving lung sound\u00a0... And be rewarded with critical garlands.\" In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Osbourne states that he cannot remember much about recording Master of Reality \"apart from the fact that Tony detuned his guitar to make it easier to play, Geezer wrote 'Sweet Leaf' about all the dope we'd been smoking, and 'Children of the Grave' was the most kick-ass song we'd ever recorded.\"", "All music composed by Black Sabbath (Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ozzy Osbourne, Bill Ward), except \"After Forever\", \"Embryo\" and \"Orchid\" by Iommi.", "* Geezer Butler \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Randy Rhoads", "response": ["Black Sabbath were also touring the US at the time and heard the news on the radio that members of Osbourne's band had been killed in a plane crash. According to bassist Geezer Butler, they panicked as they didn't know if Osbourne had been one of the casualties or not. They immediately contacted Osbourne's management to find out what had happened."]}, {"page": "Sleep (band)", "response": ["Their record The Sciences makes multiple allusions to Black Sabbath, whose sound heavily inspired Sleep. Tony Iommi is referenced in the lyrics of \"Marijuanaut's Theme\", and the song \"Giza Butler\" is a play on the city Giza and the name of Black Sabbath's bassist, Geezer Butler. Also in \"Giza Butler\", references are made to several things in Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, including the gom jabbar (referred to as the \"bong jabbar\") and Muad'Dib (as \"Muad'Doob\")."]}]}}
