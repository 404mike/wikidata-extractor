He gained his second A cap against Italy A in 2003 and was involved in the Churchill Cup success in Canada. He won a place in the England Elite Player Squad for 2003.

These arrivals were however tempered by the loss of several experienced internationals, Mike Blair, Chris Paterson, Jim Thompson, Alan MacDonald, Esteban Lozada and Phil Godman among them. However, after another poor start to the Pro12 League, Edinburgh were then beaten 0\u201345 by Saracens at Murrayfield in the first round of Heineken Cup matches.
