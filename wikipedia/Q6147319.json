He is a right-arm fast bowler who also bats right-handed. He made his debut for Somerset in the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40 against Surrey. His twin brother, Craig, plays for Somerset.Overton began a rise to wider prominence in the cricket world with a hostile spell of bowling in the opening match of the 2012 U-19 World Cup against Australia in Townsville, registering speeds approaching 93 mph (150 km/h) on his way to claiming two top-order wickets via slip catches held by his brother.On 29 May 2020, Overton was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, Overton was included in England's 30-man squad to start training behind closed doors for the Test series against the West Indies.On 1 August 2020, it was announced that Overton had rejected Somerset's offer of a new contract and had chosen to join Surrey on a three-year contract ahead of the 2021 season. In the same month, during the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy, Overton scored his maiden century in first-class cricket. In September 2020, Overton requested to join Surrey immediately on loan for the remainder of the 2020 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|88|| Jamie Overton ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm fast ||"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club", "response": ["Under new director of cricket Andy Hurry, who returned to the club, and new head coach Jason Kerr, Somerset enjoyed an excellent start to their 2018 Championship campaign, winning three of their first five matches whilst drawing the other two. However, a heavy innings defeat to Surrey in the next round proved to be pivotal, as Surrey would go on to run away with the Championship title winning 10 of their 14 matches. Nonetheless, Somerset themselves won 7 games and only lost twice, but were consigned to yet another runners-up finish. James Hildreth broke the 1000 run barrier, whilst Lewis Gregory and Craig Overton finished with 37 wickets each. Somerset struggled to find consistency in their One-Day Cup campaign, but nevertheless entered the final round of matches with a chance to qualify for a playoff. Despite winning their final game against eventual champions Hampshire, Essex secured the win they needed to reach the playoffs in place of Somerset. The 2018 season saw Somerset take a further step forward in their t20 cricket under new t20 captain Gregory, as they reached finals day for the first time in 6 years. Despite losing two of their first three games, Somerset ended up finishing top of the South Group, winning 10 of their 14 matches to earn a home quarter-final and a chance to exact revenge for the previous year on Nottinghamshire. They were able do so, winning by 19 runs on a reserve day due to the weather, sending them to finals day. There Somerset lost out to Sussex in the semi-final by 35 runs as Sussex were able to put a sizeable score of 202 on the board. The improved performance in the competition was in no small part due to the impact of overseas signings Corey Anderson, who was the team's leading run-scorer with 514 runs at a strike-rate of 169.1, and Jerome Taylor who claimed 22 wickets in his 11 matches. Jamie Overton was Somerset's leading wicket-taker with 24 in his 16 games.", "2019 was to prove to be the year Somerset finally broke their 14-year trophy drought, as they claimed victory in the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup, to end a run of 10 runners-up finishes across all formats over a 10-year span. The campaign began in brilliant style as Somerset secured their largest-ever List A margin of victory by beating Kent by 264 runs in their opening match. Victories in their next three games including a win against Essex in the first-ever game played under the new permanent floodlights at the County Ground, meant at the halfway stage in the competition, qualification to the knockout stages seemed assured. However, defeats in their next three including a resounding loss to Hampshire, who chased a target of 216 in the 32nd over, left Somerset needing a win in their final game just to make it into an away play-off game. They were able to defeat Surrey by 5 wickets, setting up a play-off game against Worcestershire at New Road. A century from Tom Banton, and a five-wicket haul from overseas player Azhar Ali saw Somerset to a comfortable win by 147 runs. In the semi-final, Somerset once again faced Nottinghamshire in a knockout game, at Trent Bridge. Somerset posted exactly the same score of 337 as they had in the play-off match, and the total once again proved to be more than enough, as Nottinghamshire were bowled out for 222, meaning Somerset reached the Lord's final where they would face defending champions Hampshire. Hampshire won the toss and chose to bat but Somerset, thanks mainly to the opening spell of Josh Davey and eventual man-of-the-match Jamie Overton in the middle overs, were able to take wickets at regular intervals, and despite a ninth-wicket stand of 64, Hampshire's total of 244/8 looked to be short of what would be required. This proved to be even more the case when Banton and Azhar Ali put on an opening partnership of 112, and despite losing both in quick succession, Somerset always looked in control. Fittingly the winning runs were scored by James Hildreth, who had also hit the winning runs as a 20-year-old in Somerset's last trophy win in 2005."]}, {"page": "West Buckland School", "response": ["*Craig and Jamie Overton (twins, born 1994), current Somerset and England Lions cricket players"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jamie Overton (2012\u20132020) 64 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Jamie Overton", "|align=left|Jamie Overton"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 10 || 120 || Jamie Overton || Warwickshire || Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Birmingham || 2020"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset List A cricket records", "response": ["| 10th || 65* || Jamie Overton & Tim Groenewald || Gloucestershire || County Ground, Taunton || 2016"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset Twenty20 cricket records", "response": ["|Jamie Overton|| 45"]}, {"page": "2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup squads", "response": ["|| Jamie Overton ||  || Right || Right-arm fast-medium"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2012", "response": ["| Jamie Overton ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm fast-medium || Academy player ||  "]}, {"page": "List of Surrey County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jamie Overton (2020) : J.
