British playwright Howard Barker has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume Arguments for a Theatre. \"You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies.

Hordern described the character as \"a man wracked by guilt, full of self-doubt and pessimism\".Hordern, p. 143. It was a role which the actor found to be too close to his own personality for comfort. His time in the play was marred by personal problems; he and Eve had briefly separated and the actor was forced to rent a small flat in Sloane Square from the actor Michael Wilding after being banished from the family home. Hordern and Eve soon reconciled, but it was a time which he was keen to forget, including the play. Critics were complimentary of his performance, with one writing: \"Stripwell's ambiguities are therefore viewed half affectionately and half contemptuously and this comes over well in Michael Hordern's portrayal of bumbling, sometimes endearing ineffectiveness, as skilful and accomplished a performance as one would expect from this actor.\""]}, {"page": "1984 in literature", "response": ["*Howard Barker \u2013 Scenes from an Execution"]}, {"page": "Sarah Kane", "response": ["Kane's first play was Blasted.
