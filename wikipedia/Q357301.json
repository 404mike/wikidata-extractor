He served as a sailor in the Royal Navy for a period after forced recruitment.\nNewton went to sea at a young age and worked on slave ships in the slave trade for several years. In 1745, he himself became a slave of Princess Peye, a woman of the Sherbro people. He was rescued, returned to sea and the trade,  becoming Captain of several slave ships. After retiring from active sea-faring, he continued to invest in the slave trade. Some years after experiencing a conversion to Christianity, Newton later renounced his trade and became a prominent supporter of abolitionism. Now an evangelical, he was ordained as a Church of England cleric and served as parish priest at Olney, Buckinghamshire, for two decades. He also wrote hymns, including \"Amazing Grace\" and \"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\".\nNewton lived to see the British Empire\u2019s abolition of the African slave trade in 1807, just months before his death.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amazing Grace", "response": ["\"Amazing Grace\" is a Christian hymn published in 1779, with words written in 1772 by the English poet and Anglican clergyman John Newton (1725\u20131807). It is an immensely popular hymn, particularly in the United States, where it is used for both religious and secular purposes.", "== John Newton's conversion ==", "According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology, \"Amazing Grace\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.\"Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound\", Dictionary of American Hymnology. Retrieved 31 October 2009.", "When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \"Hephzibah\" by English composer John Husband.The Hymn Tune Index, Search=\"Hephzibah\". University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana Library website. Retrieved 31 December 2010. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \"Amazing Grace\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835, when American composer William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \"New Britain\". This was an amalgamation of two melodies (\"Gallaher\" and \"St. Mary\"), first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \"Gallaher\" and \"St. Mary\" had not.Turner, pp. 120\u2013122. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.Turner, p. 123. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \"St. Mary\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.", "Following the appropriation of the hymn in secular music, \"Amazing Grace\" became such an icon in American culture that it has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns, placing it in danger of becoming a clich\u00e9. It has been mass-produced on souvenirs, lent its name to a Superman villain, appeared on The Simpsons to demonstrate the redemption of a murderous character named Sideshow Bob, incorporated into Hare Krishna chants and adapted for Wicca ceremonies.Turner, pp. 195\u2013205. It can also be sung to the theme from The Mickey Mouse Club, as Garrison Keillor has observed. The hymn has been employed in several films, including Alice's Restaurant, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Coal Miner's Daughter, and Silkwood. It is referenced in the 2006 film Amazing Grace, which highlights Newton's influence on the leading British abolitionist William Wilberforce,Noll and Blumhofer, p. 15. and in the film biography of Newton, Newton's Grace.Young, Wesley (1 August 2013), \"A tale of grace: Local filmmaker bringing story of John Newton to life\". Winston-Salem Journal. The 1982 science fiction film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan used \"Amazing Grace\" amid a context of Christian symbolism, to memorialise Mr. Spock following his death, but more practically, because the song has become \"instantly recognizable to many in the audience as music that sounds appropriate for a funeral\" according to a Star Trek scholar.Porter and McLaren, p. 157. Since 1954, when an organ instrumental of \"New Britain\" became a best-seller, \"Amazing Grace\" has been associated with funerals and memorial services.Turner, p. 159. The hymn has become a song that inspires hope in the wake of tragedy, becoming a sort of \"spiritual national anthem\" according to authors Mary Rourke and Emily Gwathmey.Rourke and Gwathmey, p. 108. For example, President Barack Obama recited and later sang the hymn at the memorial service for Clementa Pinckney, who was one of the nine victims of the Charleston church shooting in 2015.", "Freedom (2014 film) tells the story of slave trader John Newton and his composition of the hymn.", "Due to its immense popularity and iconic nature, the meaning behind the words of \"Amazing Grace\" has become as individual as the singer or listener.Turner, pp. 218\u2013220. Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of \"Amazing Grace\" is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins \"When we've been there ten thousand years\"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. \"Grace\", however, had a clearer meaning to John Newton, as he used the word to represent God or the power of God.Noll and Blumhofer, p. 16.", "The transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist Bill Moyers in a documentary released in 1990. Moyers was inspired to focus on the song's power after watching a performance at Lincoln Center, where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them.Pollock, John (2009). \"Amazing Grace: The great Sea Change in the Life of John Newton\", The Trinity Forum Reading, The Trinity Forum. James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose \"Amazing Grace\" to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: \"there is a transformative power that is applicable\u00a0... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature.\"Basker, p. xxxiv.", "* Aitken, Jonathan (2007).

The older tradition was based on the poetry of the Bible: the Psalms.  According to LeFebvre, Psalms had been sung by God's people from the time of King David, who with a large staff over many years assembled the complete book of Psalms in a form appropriate for singing (by the Levites, during Temple sacrifices at the time).  The practice of singing Psalms in worship was continued by Biblical command in the New Testament Church from its beginnings in Acts through the time of Watts, as documented by Prutow.  The teachings of 16th-century Reformation leaders such as John Calvin, who translated the Psalms in the vernacular for congregational singing, followed this historic worship practice.
