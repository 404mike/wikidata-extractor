Consider a procedure that is determined by a finite set of instructions in the following way. A computation is begun. The computation proceeds algorithmically except that, from time to time, the computing agent may be requested to obtain an \u201cinput\" integer, and, from time to time the procedure yields an \u201coutput\u201d integer. When an input is requested, any integer, or no integer, may be supplied. Assume that when the members of B are supplied, in any order whatsoever as inputs, then the computation always eventually yields the set A, in some order, as outputs. The order in which the members of A appear may vary as the order of inputs varies. (We permit repetitions in the listing of B and in the listing of A.) If such a procedure exists we say that A is enumeration reducible to B.The concept of e-reducibility was first introduced by the results of John Myhill, which concluded that \"a set is many-one complete if and only if it is recursively enumerable and its complement is productive\". This result extends to e-reducibility as well. E-reducibility was later formally codified by Rogers and his collaborator Richard M. Friedberg in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik (the predecessor of Mathematical Logic Quarterly) in 1959."]}]}}
