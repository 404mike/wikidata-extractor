Despite being primarily a churchman, he maintained an active interest in research-level mathematics, and was listed by Alexander Macfarlane as one of ten leading 19th-century British mathematicians. In the 1840s, he obtained an existence theorem for Steiner triple systems that founded the field of combinatorial design theory, while the related Kirkman's schoolgirl problem is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steiner system", "response": ["Some of the S(2,3,n) systems can have their blocks be partitioned into (n-1)/2 sets of (n/3) triples each. This is called resolvable and such systems are called Kirkman triple systems after Thomas Kirkman, who studied such resolvable systems before Steiner. Dale Mesner, Earl Kramer, and others investigated collections of Steiner triple systems that are mutually disjoint (i.e., no two Steiner systems in such a collection share a common triplet). It is known (Bays 1917, Kramer & Mesner 1974) that seven different S(2,3,9) systems can be generated to together cover all 84 triplets on a 9-set; it was also known by them that there are 15360 different ways to find such 7-sets of solutions, which reduce to two non-isomorphic solutions under relabeling, with multiplicities 6720 and 8640 respectively."]}, {"page": "Travelling salesman problem", "response": ["The travelling salesman problem was mathematically formulated in the 19th century by the Irish mathematician W.R.

He gave two different sequences of triple systems, one for n = 7, 15, 19, 27, etc, and another for n = 9, 13, 25, etc. Using these propositions, he proved that triple systems exist for all values of n = 1 or 3 (mod 6) (not necessarily resolvable ones, but triple systems in general). He also described resolvable triple systems in detail in that paper, particularly for n = 9 and 15; resolvable triple systems are now known as Kirkman triple systems.
