He was born at Andover, the eldest son of Turner Poulter Clarke.  He was educated at King's College School, London, and at Trinity and Queens' Colleges, Cambridge. He began the study of law at Lincoln's Inn in 1856 and was called to the bar in 1860. He lectured in mathematics at Presidency College, Calcutta, from 1857 to 1865. Clarke was Inspector of Schools in Eastern Bengal and later of India, and superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Garden from 1869 to 1871. He retired from the Indian Civil Service in 1887. He was president of the Linnean Society from 1894 to 1896, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1882. He worked at Royal Botanic Gardens Kew until his death in 1906. \nThere are number of plants with specific name clarkei, including Iris clarkei.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Clarke (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Charles Baron Clarke (1832\u20131906), British botanist"]}, {"page": "List of authors of South African botanical taxa", "response": ["*Charles Baron Clarke (1832\u20131906) P, S ........

As soon as 1805, other authors began to treat the name as a synonym of Commelina communis, while others excluded it altogether. Some, such as G.H.E. Muhlenberg in 1818, did continue to recognise the species as distinct. In 1881, Charles Baron Clarke began to treat it as a synonym of Commelina diffusa, then known as Commelina nudiflora. In the 20th century its placement varied, with Albert Radford treating it as a doubtful species in his 1968 Manual of the Vascular Flora of the Carolinas, and Duncan and Kartesz continuing to consider it a synonym of C. diffusa in their 1981 Vascular Flora of Georgia.", "Robert Faden published a paper in 1989 that reviewed the literature regarding the species. After studying Walter's original description and specimens, Faden determined that the species was in fact distinct from C. diffusa. Furthermore, while working on the Flora of Ceylon project, Faden noticed that C. caroliniana was identical to a species found in India, namely Commelina hasskarlii. This name had been given by Charles Baron Clarke in 1874, nearly a century after the description of C. caroliniana. Given that C. caroliniana was closely related to several other old world species of Commelina more than any other North American species, Faden determined that Commelina caroliniana must have been introduced and made Commelina hasskarlii a synonym of it."]}, {"page": "Utricularia smithiana", "response": ["Utricularia smithiana is a medium-sized, probably perennial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia.

Because Commelina sphaerorrhizoma is the only Commelina with unfused spathes, blue flowers, trivalved capsules and one-seeded locules, its relationships remain unknown."]}, {"page": "Charles B.
