Second Division Preston North End were also willing to pay the \u00a36,000 fee, but refused to pay a signing-on fee, whilst Port Vale offered Grainger wages of \u00a330-a-week with bonuses and a \u00a3300 signing-on fee as they wanted to match Potteries derby rivals Stoke City's ambition in re-signing Stanley Matthews. His debut was described as a 'triumphant' one as he scored in a 4\u20131 win over Torquay United at Vale Park on 21 October. On 27 January, he helped his new team to a 0\u20130 draw at former club Sunderland in the FA Cup fourth round and before the match gave his teammates placebo pills in order to boost their confidence. Four days later they completing the giant-killing with a 3\u20131 win at home and Grainger later commented that it was his best performance either playing for or against Sunderland. The club failed to replicate this form in the league however and Grainger picked up a groin injury during one of coach Eric Jones's notoriously strenuous fitness sessions. He took a cortisone injection to get him through the fifth round defeat at Fulham on 17 February and then ruled himself out of action for the rest of the 1961\u201362 season; Vale went on to end the campaign in a disappointing 12th-position."]}]}}
