In his role as the society's sole artistic director, he brought to London Marilyn Horne, Joan Sutherland, and Boris Christoff.   He was also responsible for introducing Sherrill Milnes, Ruggero Raimondi, and Montserrat Caball\u00e9.  He was a highly regarded expert in the field of opera with an extensive knowledge of the history of vocal music, and his books include volumes 1 and 2 of The Record of Singing and  The Great Caruso. In 1992, he also wrote Maria Meneghini Callas, being one of the few Maria Callas biographers to have seen her frequently on stage in her prime. He was also a contributor to Opera News.In the review of this book for Opera News, Albert Innaurato writes, \"His is the only biography to understand how Callas compares with and differs from Tetrazzini, Ponselle and Patti. And since Scott is neither a hysteric nor a fan, he is just and interesting in comparing Callas with Tebaldi and Sutherland. In fact his crisp, unsentimental manner may unsettle some readers\u2014he responds to Callas as an artist, not as a tragedy queen, and does not linger over her miserable last years or indulge in psychologizing.\"Michael Scott died in Minehead, England, on 6 April 2019, at the age of 84.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maria Callas", "response": ["The great turning point in Callas's career occurred in Venice in 1949.Callas in her Own Words. Audio documentary. 3 CDs. Eklipse Records. EKR P-14. She was engaged to sing the role of Br\u00fcnnhilde in Die Walk\u00fcre at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in I puritani in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas that she would be singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Br\u00fcnnhildes to sing, he told her \"I guarantee that you can\". Michael Scott's words, \"the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner's Br\u00fcnnhilde and Bellini's Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like folie de grandeur\". Before the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, \"We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct I puritani with a dramatic soprano ... When can we expect a new edition of La traviata with [male baritone] Gino Bechi's Violetta?\" After the performance, one critic wrote, \"Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished... the flexibility of her limpid, beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras.\" Franco Zeffirelli recalled, \"What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the size of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, who is one of the great coloratura sopranos of our time.\"", "Callas's voice has been difficult to place in the modern vocal classification or Fach system, especially since in her prime, her repertoire contained the heaviest dramatic soprano roles as well as roles usually undertaken by the highest, lightest and most agile coloratura sopranos. Regarding this versatility, Serafin said, \"This woman can sing anything written for the female voice\". Michael Scott argues that Callas's voice was a natural high soprano, and going by evidence of Callas's early recordings, Rosa Ponselle likewise felt that \"At that stage of its development, her voice was a pure but sizable dramatic coloratura\u2014that is to say, a sizable coloratura voice with dramatic capabilities, not the other way around.\"Ponselle, Rosa, Ponselle, a Singer's Life, Doubleday, Garden City, 1982 On the other hand, music critic John Ardoin has argued that Callas was the reincarnation of the 19th-century soprano sfogato or \"unlimited soprano\", a throwback to Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta, for whom many of the famous bel canto operas were written. He avers that like Pasta and Malibran, Callas was a natural mezzo-soprano whose range was extended through training and willpower, resulting in a voice which \"lacked the homogeneous color and evenness of scale once so prized in singing. There were unruly sections of their voices never fully under control. Many who heard Pasta, for example, remarked that her uppermost notes seemed produced by ventriloquism, a charge which would later be made against Callas\". Ardoin points to the writings of Henry Chorley about Pasta which bear an uncanny resemblance to descriptions of Callas:", "Regarding the sheer size of Callas's instrument, Rodolfo Celletti says, \"Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it frequently contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium.\" Celletti wrote that Callas had \"a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice\" (una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro).Celletti, Rodolfo. Le Grandi Voci \u2013 Dizionario Critico-Biografico dei Cantanti. Istituto per la collaborazione Culturale, 1964. (extract). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that \"she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience.\" In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, \"But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, at the bottom of the range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top.\"Opera News (December 1982). In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas's pre-1954 voice was a \"dramatic soprano with an exceptional top\", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia, a \"huge soprano leggiero\".", "In addition to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language and the use of language in music. In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes, \"If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text.\" Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states, \"What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something\u2014it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art.\" Walter Legge states that,", "Michael Scott has proposed that Callas's loss of strength and breath support was directly caused by her rapid and progressive weight loss, something that was noted even in her prime. Of her 1958 recital in Chicago, Robert Detmer wrote, \"There were sounds fearfully uncontrolled, forced beyond the too-slim singer's present capacity to support or sustain.\"", "In 1957, while still married to husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini, Callas was introduced to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis at a party given in her honor by Elsa Maxwell after a performance in Donizetti's Anna Bolena. The affair that followed received much publicity in the popular press, and in November 1959, Callas left her husband. Michael Scott asserts that Onassis was not sure why Callas largely abandoned her career, but that he offered her a way out of a career that was made increasingly difficult by scandals and by vocal resources that were diminishing at an alarming rate. Franco Zeffirelli, on the other hand, recalls asking Callas in 1963 why she had not practiced her singing, and Callas responding that \"I have been trying to fulfill my life as a woman.\" According to one of her biographers, Nicholas Gage, Callas and Onassis had a child, a boy, who died hours after he was born on March 30, 1960. In his book about his wife, Meneghini states categorically that Maria Callas was unable to bear children. Various sources also dismiss Gage's claim, as they note that the birth certificates Gage used to prove this \"secret child\" were issued in 1998, twenty-one years after Callas's death. Still other sources claim that Callas had at least one abortion while involved with Onassis.John Ardoin in Callas, La Divina (film documentary)  In 1966, Callas renounced her U.S. citizenship at the American Embassy in Paris, to facilitate the end of her marriage to Meneghini. This was because after her renunciation, she was only a Greek citizen, and under Greek law of that time, a Greek could legally marry only in a Greek Orthodox church. As she had married in a Roman Catholic church, this divorced her in Greece. The renunciation also helped her finances, as she no longer had to pay U.S. taxes on her income. The relationship ended two years later in 1968, when Onassis left Callas for Jacqueline Kennedy. However, the Onassis family's private secretary, Kiki, writes in her memoir that even while Aristotle was with Jackie, he frequently met with Maria in Paris, where they resumed what had now become a clandestine affair."]}, {"page": "Vibrato", "response": ["References: For more information about the historical employment of vibrato by classical vocalists, see Michael Scott's two-volume survey The Record of Singing (published by Duckworth, London, in 1977 and 1979); John Potter's Tenor: History of a Voice (Yale University Press, New Haven & London, 2009); and Herman Klein's 30 Years of Music in London (Century, New York, 1903)."]}, {"page": "Francesco Tamagno", "response": ["Tamagno lived long enough to witness the rise to fame of the young Enrico Caruso (1873\u20131921). He admired Caruso's ability, predicting as far back as 1898 that Caruso would go on to become the number-one Italian tenor of the 20th century. As M. J. Phillips-Matz observes in her 2002 Puccini biography, Tamagno and Caruso actually appeared on the same stage in February 1901, during a concert at La Scala. The concert had been organised by Toscanini as a commemorative tribute to the recently deceased Verdi. (In it, Tamagno sang an extract from La forza del destino and Caruso led the quartet from Rigoletto.) Opera commentator Michael Scott states that Tamagno gave his last performance as Otello in Rome in 1903, when he starred in a gala production mounted for Kaiser Wilhelm II.", "Tamagno's beloved daughter Margherita, who had been born out of wedlock, and for whom he cared from her birth, writing to her throughout his career and her childhood incredibly moving letters, inherited his considerable estate, according to biographer Ugo Piavano. Piavano's definitive biography, Otello Fu: La Vera Vita di Francesco Tamagno, il \"tenore-cannone\", was published in Milan in 2005 by Rugginenti Editore to mark the 100th anniversary of the singer's death. Both Volume One of Michael Scott's The Record of Singing (published by Duckworth, London, 1977) and J. B.
