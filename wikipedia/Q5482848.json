The shows featured Tommy Handley in the central role, a fast-talking figure, around whom all the other characters orbited. The programmes were written by Ted Kavanagh and produced by Francis Worsley. Handley died during the twelfth series, the remaining programmes of which were immediately cancelled: ITMA could not work without him, and no further series were commissioned.", "Although the BBC featured many comic acts in its variety programmes, it had no regular comedy series until early 1938, when Band Waggon and Danger! Men at Work began. The former, which ran for three series in 1938 and 1939, was a particular success; John Watt, the BBC's director of variety, wanted a successor and decided that Handley would be the right person to present it. In June 1939 Handley, Kavanagh and the producer Francis Worsley met at the Langham Hotel, London to discuss ideas for a sketch show to meet Watt's criteria. They decided to emulate the quick-fire style of American radio programmes such as the Burns and Allen Show, although with a much more English quality."]}, {"page": "Tommy Handley", "response": ["Towards the end of the 1930s Handley and Kavanagh were, in Took's words, \"at a crossroads\", in need of \"a new direction in which to move and a new stimulus to drive them forward\".Took, p. 22 The new direction and stimulus came with the BBC's need for a replacement for Band Waggon, an immensely successful hour-long variety programme starring Arthur Askey and Richard Murdoch.Burton and Chibnall, p. 194; and Took, p. 21 Askey's career was developing elsewhere, on stage and screen, and the 1939 run of the show was its last.Took, p. 21 Kavanagh and Handley, together with the BBC producer Francis Worsley, conceived a successor. Instead of the one-off sketches to which Handley and Kavanagh were accustomed, the new show would be 45 minutes in length.
