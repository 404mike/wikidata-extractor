He also composed five operas and a number of other orchestral works, as well as songs, choral music and a small amount of chamber music.\nBrian enjoyed a period of popularity earlier in his career and rediscovery in the 1950s. Public performances of his music have remained rare however, and he has remained the subject of a small but enthusiastic following rather than general popularity: he has been described as a 'cult composer'. He continued to be extremely productive late into his career, composing large works even into his nineties, the majority of which remained unperformed during his lifetime.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
