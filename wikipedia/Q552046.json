He is best known for having composed 32 symphonies (an unusually high total for a 20th-century composer), most of them late in his life. His best-known work is his Symphony No. 1, The Gothic, which calls for some of the largest orchestral forces demanded by a conventionally structured concert work. He also composed five operas and a number of other orchestral works, as well as songs, choral music and a small amount of chamber music. Brian enjoyed a period of popularity earlier in his career and rediscovery in the 1950s, but public performances of his music have remained rare and he has been described as a cult composer. He continued to be extremely productive late into his career, composing large works even into his nineties, most of which remained unperformed during his lifetime.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 29", "response": ["*1876 \u2013 Havergal Brian, English composer (d. 1972)"]}, {"page": "John Donne", "response": ["After the 17th century there were no more until the start of the 20th century with Havergal Brian (\"A nocturnal on St Lucy's Day\", first performed in 1905), Eleanor Everest Freer (\"Break of Day, published in 1905) and Walford Davies (\"The Cross\", 1909) among the earliest.

This idea was repudiated by Brian's close friend Granville Bantock, but returned when Brian turned to writing symphonies after the end of the First World War. The Gothic element refers to the vision of the Gothic age (from about 1150 to 1500) as representing a huge (almost unlimited) expansion in humanity's artistic and intellectual development, but particularly manifest in the architecture of the great European cathedrals. The scale of the choral finale, which took several years to write, appears to be an attempt to evoke the scale and detail of this architecture in sound; Brian had to paste blank pages of score together to be able to write the work on gigantic sheets with 54 staves to the page.Havergal Brian, 'How the \"Gothic\" Symphony came to be written', Modern Mystic, December 1938.  Brian also seems to have identified with the character of Faust, particularly in attempting to write such affirmative music in the post-war atmosphere when many composers had turned from pre-war giganticism, and the finale bears an apposite quote from Goethe's Faust Part Two Act V, which translates as \"The man who ever strives may earn redemption\".

The first movement appears to feature two extremely contrasted ideas in the style of sonata form, one a vigorous leaping figure in D minor, the other a suave melody first stated on solo violin in the remote key of D-flat major, though the working out of the music involves a process of ongoing development within the exposition, and avoids the expected re-capitulation by reversing the order of musical events, with the return of the first idea effectively starting the coda. The second movement begins with a stately and solemn march, almost as for a funeral cortege, which builds to a grim and powerful conclusion. The third movement starts with an ostinato in the style of Brucknerp.  309, MacDonald (1983) Malcolm.

After various developments culminating in a bizarre polytonal passage with a virtuoso xylophone cadenza, the theme is transformed into a climactic march which eventually throws the movement into the home key of D minor, and subsides quietly with the original statement of the music for horns followed by a harp arpeggio and a final chord of D major.", "Havergal Brian#Recordings of the symphonies", "The Havergal Brian Society has a number of essays and further detail on the symphony.", "Category:Symphonies by Havergal Brian"]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 5 (Vaughan Williams)", "response": ["Vaughan Williams dedicated the symphony to Jean Sibelius.
