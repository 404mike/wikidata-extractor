The book received praise from both proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage. In the San Francisco Book Review, Elizabeth Raymond wrote, \"Debating Same-Sex Marriages format is quite interesting \u2013 and massively effective . . . It's like witnessing a live debate between these two lively characters . . . I highly recommend this to all \u2013 if only for a manual on how to respectfully debate a member of the opposing viewpoint. Well done!\" Among other positive reviews were those from LGBT rights activist Dan Savage, Republican senator Rick Santorum, Matt Reynolds of Christianity Today, and Ryan T. Anderson of National Review. In The Times Literary Supplement, libertarian Nigel Ashford commented that \"the tone of the book\u2014of reason and logic, respect for opponents and willingness to engage in intellectual combat\u2014is set by Corvino himself in his examination of the case against homosexuality, and by the inclusion of a rebuttal of his own arguments.\"Ashford, Nigel.
