Howard is eccentric, socially inept and has many strange mannerisms. He is also the only non-fresher in the house, and the only housemate who does not demonstrate even the remotest interest in politics. With the exception of his housemates, he has few friends, but is usually friendly and well mannered. The housemates tend to approach him with caution, and his behaviour has occasionally cost them popularity. He does not socially interact very often, but has had a sexual fling with former housemate Sabine, and took a liking to Sam in the early parts of the third series. In the fifth episode of the third series, he is shown to be somewhat attracted to Candice, and they later form a relationship. His surname changes repeatedly throughout the series \u2014 in series 1, it is Rowbottom; in series 2, it is MacCallum; and in series 3 and 4, it is McGregor. Whether this is accidental or deliberate is unclear - ultimately, it is confirmed in series 4 that Howard's real surname is McGregor. In the fourth series Howard's reclusion worsens, becoming obsessed with studying for his final exams and partly due to breaking up with Candice. He eventually manages to secure a position at Ordnance Survey, despite his fears of living in London. In keeping with his superior intellect to the rest of the group, he is the highest achieving of all, finishing the year with first-class honours (\"a one\" or \"a first\"), and being the only one to leave with secure employment. It is revealed in the last episode of the series that he does not actually live in Scotland as he had led everyone to believe, but a rather few streets down from the house where the gang have been living for three years, and he had neglected to tell anyone because his parents embarrassed him.
