Originally with Ben McCrow delivering a deep, death growl-style, and Mr. Gore (Jason Merle) providing contrast to this with a high-pitched yelling and screaming. When Wilson joined as the band's bass player on the album Only Tools and Corpses he also added to the vocals by delivering high-pitched growls and additional screams, thus the band had three different voices going at times. After Mr. Gore's departure in 2004, Wilson took over his vocal parts in the older songs. The guitar riffs are often fast and technical, with the bass usually doubling these parts. Both the guitars and the bass are tuned down one whole-step (guitars are tuned to D), to achieve a heavier sound. The drumming is extremely fast, often making use of blast beats and double bass.", "*Ben McCrow - vocals (1999-2014)"]}, {"page": "The Rotted", "response": ["*Ben McCrow \u2013 vocals, 2008-2014"]}, {"page": "Get Dead or Die Trying", "response": ["* Ben McCrow - Vocals"]}, {"page": "Ad Nauseam (The Rotted album)", "response": ["*Ben McCrow \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "McCrow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben McCrow"]}, {"page": "Extreme Noise Terror (album)", "response": ["Extreme Noise Terror is the sixth studio album by English grindcore band Extreme Noise Terror.
