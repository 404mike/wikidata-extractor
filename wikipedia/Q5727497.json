Captain Reynolds reorganised his men and then proceeded alone, rushing from shell-hole to shell-hole under heavy fire. When near the pill-box, he threw a grenade which should have fallen inside, but the entrance was blocked, so crawling to the entrance he forced a phosphorus grenade in. This set the place on fire, killing three, and the remainder surrendered with two machine-guns. Afterwards, although wounded, Captain Reynolds captured another objective, with 70 prisoners and two more machine-guns.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Reynolds (British army officer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Reynolds (soldier)"]}, {"page": "Henry Reynolds (VC)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Reynolds (soldier)"]}]}}
