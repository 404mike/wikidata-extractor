The London Working Men's Association led the Chartist movement demanding universal suffrage. Many have viewed Owenite socialism and Chartism as mutually hostile because of Owen's refusal to engage in politics.

Together with his close associates, William Lovett, John Cleave and James Watson, he was a leading member of numerous co-operative and radical groups, including the Owenite British Association for the Promotion of Co-operative Knowledge, the National Union of the Working Classes and the London Working Men's Association. As proprietor of The Poor Man's Guardian he played a major role in the \"War of the Unstamped\" and was imprisoned three times for refusing to pay newspaper stamp duty. He was a leader of the \"moral force\" wing of the Chartist movement and a supporter of pro-democracy movements in other countries. His name is included on the Reformers' Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery.", "Like other leading BAPCK members such as Lovett, Watson and John Cleave, Hetherington did not believe that co-operation could be divorced from the struggle for political rights. While still members of the BAPCK he and the others joined several short-lived radical political groups, whose aims and membership often overlapped. These included, the Civil and Religious Liberty Association (CRLA), which campaigned for Catholic emancipation; the Radical Reform Association (RRA) (18291831), led by Henry Hunt to demand universal (male) suffrage; and the National Union of the Working Classes (NUWC) (18311835), which absorbed the remnants of all the other groups, to become London's leading ultra-radical force of the early 1830s.Hollis, 'Introduction', The Poor Man's Guardian 1831-1835, pp. ix-xii.Prothero, pp. 275-285.Belcham, John, Orator' Hunt: Henry Hunt and English Working Class Radicalism (Breviary Stuff Publications, 2012; ) pp. 148-162.Claeys, Gregory, Citizens and Saints: Politics and anti-politics in early British Socialism (Cambridge University Press, 1989; ) pp. 174/5, 183-189.Hollis, The Pauper Press, pp. 102/3.", "Hetherington and other speakers, including John Cleave and Henry Vincent, toured the country promoting universal suffrage and encouraging local groups to organise along LWMA lines.Prothero, p. 320.West, Julius, A History of the Chartist Movement (Constable & Co., 1920) p. 92.
