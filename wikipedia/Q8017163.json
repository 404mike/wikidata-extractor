By 1689, the guildhall was in use as a bridewell, and from 1787 it was used as a workhouse. Prison cells and mortuary buildings were established in the area behind the guildhall in 1833. In 1887, the guildhall was acquired by Sir Cuthbert Quilter, a local member of parliament, and he restored it in around 1911. It was used as a social club for American troops stationed nearby and also as a British Restaurant during the Second World War and, in 1946, Sir William Quilter gave it to the people of Lavenham. It became the property of the National Trust in 1951 and it was subsequently opened to the public as a local history museum."]}]}}
