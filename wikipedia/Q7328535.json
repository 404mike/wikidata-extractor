He was an all-rounder noted as a slow bowler who maintained good line and length and a \"fair hitter\".

A contemporary report in the Maidstone Journal describes the game as \"Sir H. Mann with a select eleven of the County against S. Amherst, Esq. and the County at large, for 100 guineas\".Buckley, p. 135. The ACS calls the match \"Sir H. Mann v S. Amherst\".ACS, p. 27.

This follows Haygarth, whose title is \"East Kent with Boorman and Four of Hampshire versus West Kent with Four of Surrey\". East Kent won by 8 runs and Haygarth confirms Mann and Amherst as respective managers. The guest players in this match were John Boorman, Richard Purchase, John Small, David Harris and Tom Taylor for the East and Billy Beldham, Harry Walker, Tom Walker and John Wells for the West. Apart from a couple of changes in the East Kent lineup, the same teams met again at Coxheath on 4 and 5 August, East Kent winning by 57 runs.Haygarth, p. 96."]}, {"page": "Purchase, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Purchase"]}, {"page": "Alphabetical cricket teams", "response": ["Haygarth is not entirely correct in his analysis of the two teams because Hambledon included four players from elsewhere and Kent two. Lumpy Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey was, as Haygarth says, a \"given man\" on the Hambledon/Hampshire side but, in addition, the team included Earl of Winchilsea (White Conduit Club), Edward Hussey (Kent) and William Fennex (Middlesex). The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex. The other nine were usually associated with Kent: Stephen Amherst, James Aylward (though he played for Hampshire until 1779), Francis Booker, John Boorman, William Bowra, William Brazier, William Bullen, Robert Clifford and Henry Crozoer."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|Richard Purchase", "|Richard Purchase, CricInfo.
