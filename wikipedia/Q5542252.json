He cultivated a friendship with Mabel Brookes, and through Brookes became acquainted with senior members of the influential Australian Women's National League (AWNL). He also secured the patronage of Robert Menzies, with whom he shared a similar background and political views.Frame (2005), p. 11. At the 1934 federal election, Holt stood for the UAP in the Division of Yarra. It was a safe seat for the Labor Party, held by the party's leader (and former prime minister) James Scullin. Holt lost heavily, as was expected, but was praised for his campaigning. Early the following year, he contested Clifton Hill \u2013 another safe Labor seat \u2013 at the Victorian state election, losing to Bert Cremean.Frame (2005), p. 10. Holt was eventually elected to parliament on his third attempt, winning a federal by-election for the seat of Fawkner in August 1935; his predecessor, George Maxwell, had died in office. He won UAP preselection against five other candidates, a victory which Smith's Weekly attributed to his \"political godmothers\" in the AWNL.Political Godmothers Rule U.A.P. With Haughty Mien, Smith's Weekly, 10 August 1935.

Hughes moved an amendment to the bill that stipulated it should only take effect after being approved by the people at a referendum or general election. Bruce ruled out any referendum, stating that the amendment would constitute a vote of confidence in his government and urged his party to vote it down. Nationalist MP Walter Marks and Independent MP William McWilliams joined the opposition, giving the opposition a one-vote majority. Bruce and his supporters now lobbied the Speaker, Sir Littleton Groom to make a deliberative vote in committee to tie the numbers, leaving the Committee chairman James Bayley with the casting (and presumably pro-government) vote. Groom refused, citing long-standing Westminster (though not Australian) parliamentary tradition of the speaker's impartiality. Groom's bitterness at having been dismissed by Bruce from the job of Attorney-General in 1925 had a significant bearing on his later decision."]}, {"page": "Trinity College, Melbourne", "response": ["*George Maxwell - lawyer and Australian politician"]}, {"page": "Division of Fawkner", "response": ["| rowspan=5 | George Maxwell"]}, {"page": "Australian Party", "response": ["After the 1929 election, Hughes made unsuccessful attempts to rejoin both the Nationalists and the Labor Party, in the hopes that he could return as prime minister. He eventually resolved to form his own party, which he hoped would secure the balance of power.Fitzhardinge (1979), p. 591. The new party was launched on 2 December 1929. Three other federal MPs joined Hughes as members\u2014Walter Marks, George Maxwell, and Senator Walter Duncan.Fitzhardinge (1979), p. 592. The press regarded the Australian Party as a simply a vehicle for Hughes' ambitions; The Sun, a Sydney tabloid, was the only newspaper to give it favourable publicity. The party claimed 75 branches and 4,000 members at its peak, but the only real activity took place in the electorates of its MPs. It was predominantly based in New South Wales, with a limited presence in Victoria and abortive attempts to expand to South Australia.Fitzhardinge (1979), p. 593. Hughes and Marks were the party's chief financial backers, because membership fees were deliberately kept low and one of the party's planks was to refuse corporate donations. However, Hughes in particular was stingy with his money, sending the party treasurer only \u00a3100 out of a requested \u00a3250 for expenses and even then complaining about the cost.Fitzhardinge (1979), p. 594.", "George Maxwell resigned from the party in May 1930 to rejoin the Nationalists, citing policy differences.Fitzhardinge (1979), p. 595. The party secretary, W. F. Jackson, did likewise in August, personally attacking Hughes in an open letter to The Sydney Morning Herald.Fitzhardinge (1979), p. 596. In September, Hughes published a 16-page pamphlet titled \"Bond or Free? Sir Otto Niemeyer\u2019s Report\", which sold nearly 50,000 copies in a month (at threepence each). It was widely quoted in newspapers. The statement effectively placed the Australian Party to the left of the federal Labor government on economic issues, and close to the radical views held by Lang Labor. The Sun withdrew its support of the party, and Walter Marks resigned his membership, citing Hughes' failure to consult him.Fitzhardinge (1979), p. 597.", "* George Maxwell"]}, {"page": "List of Australian federal by-elections", "response": ["|George Maxwell"]}, {"page": "List of physically disabled politicians", "response": ["* George Maxwell, member of the House of Representatives (deteriorating eyesight, eventually went blind)"]}, {"page": "1931 Australian federal election", "response": ["| George Maxwell", "| George Maxwell"]}, {"page": "1929 Australian federal election", "response": ["Hughes and Mann joined the opposition in denouncing the bill, and were joined by rebelling Nationalist George Maxwell and independent Percy Stewart. At the second reading of the bill in September, it was apparent that it would narrowly pass. However, when the bill entered the committee stage, Hughes moved an amendment that the bill should not be proclaimed until submitted to the people, either by referendum or general election. Attorney-General John Latham noted that the Commonwealth had no power to call a referendum, making general election the only constitutionally valid result of the amendment. Bruce agreed, stating that the amendment would constitute a vote of confidence in his government. The amendment had the support of the opposition, as well as the three Nationalist defectors. Independents Stewart and William McWilliams also indicated their support. The critical vote came down to Nationalist Walter Marks, who was known to be a supporter of the bill but unhappy with the government's handling of the movie industry, of which he was an ardent supporter.
