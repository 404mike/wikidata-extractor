He is best known for his work as guitarist for Cardiacs and as bass player for The Wildhearts and Lifesigns.\nPoole is the frontman and main performer of God Damn Whores, and has also worked with the bands Ablemesh, Dr Brighton and Celebricide. He is currently the live bass player for The Lotus Eaters and has joined the Brighton band La Momo' as drummer. He also fronts The Dowling Poole along with Willie Dowling, and has released three albums and a number of EPs with this project.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cardiacs", "response": ["Sarah left Cardiacs in 1989, though still appeared as a guest artist in later releases, and the band was joined by Christian Hayes, later replaced by Jon Poole. Luckman was replaced by Bob Leith on drums and, as a four-piece comprising T. Smith, J. Smith, Poole and Leith, the band produced the albums Sing to God (1996) and Guns (1999). In 2003, the band performed at The Garage in London with Kavus Torabi replacing Poole on guitar, resulting in the live album The Special Garage Concerts (2005). The last Cardiacs studio album, provisionally titled LSD, was recorded with an expanded line-up and has yet to be released. Keyboardist Colvin Mayers died of an AIDS-related disease in 1993, and Tim Smith died of a heart attack in 2020 after living with the rare neurological disorder dystonia for twelve years following a cardiopulmonary arrest in 2008. Many other members remain musically active.", "Although the band had historically been well-used to line-up changes, Cardiacs were profoundly affected by the multiple departures taking place between 1989 and 1991. A particular blow had been the departure of Drake, whose virtuoso keyboard skills and compositional input had made him one of the backbones of the band. Drake was considered irreplaceable and Cardiacs opted not to look for a new keyboard player, remaining as a quartet of two guitars, bass and drums (with Christian Hayes being replaced as second guitarist by Jon Poole who had previously played with the Cardiacs-inspired Milton Keynes band Ad Nauseam). While Cardiacs was still able to record more fully orchestrated music in the studio, a lack of suitable personnel (or the budget to keep them in place) meant that the live band had to change drastically. Abandoning several signature musical features (saxophone, assorted percussion and virtuoso keyboards), Cardiacs' live music shifted away from the wider instrumentation of the past and moved towards a more guitar-heavy, power-rock sound in line with the remaining quartet lineup. However, the music remained complex, if narrower in focus, and Smith recorded additional keyboard and percussion parts onto backing tapes for the band to play over.", "Prior to the departure of Hayes, Cardiacs had recorded an album called Heaven Born and Ever Bright (which featured several of Hayes' guitar and vocal parts, plus a track he had co-written called \"Goodbye Grace\"). This was released as the new Cardiacs album in the summer of 1992, the first fruit of a new distribution deal with Rough Trade Records. However, Rough Trade ceased trading shortly after the release of the album. This ensured that Heaven Born and Ever Bright could neither be stocked nor ordered by record shops, with the result that Cardiacs were left thousands of pounds in debt and unable to recoup their recording expenses. (The album was eventually reissued on a revived Alphabet Business Concern in 1995 \u2013 it featured a picture of Jon Poole on the cover, although he had not actually played on the album when it was recorded.)", "Despite this crippling blow, the band soldiered on, but by July 1993 yet another long-term member \u2013 drummer Dominic Luckman \u2013 had decided to quit. He played his last concert as a Cardiac member on 20 July at Camden Palace, London (and would later join the Shrubbies). In December 1993, Cardiacs revealed their new drummer, Jon Poole's former Ad Nauseam bandmate, Bob Leith. However, the following year proved to be Cardiacs' quietest year for a long time, with only four concerts played in total.", "After three years without any new releases, 1995 saw the release of the Bellyeye single on Org Records (the record-releasing wing of long-term Cardiacs' supporters Organ Magazine). This was a taster for Cardiacs' most epic recorded effort to date. Sing to God was a double album, due to the sheer amount of material that Tim had written over a number of years. The album was notable for a change in Cardiacs' working methods \u2013 whereas most previous material had been written and arranged by Smith, the Sing to God sessions saw extensive contributions from Jon Poole who played a strong role in orchestrating Smith's basic material with detailed riffs and keyboard parts (and contributed several songs entirely written by himself). Drummer Bob Leith also made significant contributions to the album's lyrics.", "During 1999\u20132000, Cardiacs began work on a new studio album that remains incomplete and unreleased. Only one song slated for inclusion (\"Faster Than Snakes With a Ball and a Chain\") has ever been released to the public (it appears on the band's 2002 compilation Greatest Hits). Another song, the Jon Poole-penned \"Silvery\", appeared regularly in the band's live repertoire, and was later re-recorded by Jon Poole himself for the God Damn Whores' second album (albeit under the title \"Sparkly Silver Sky\"). While Tim Smith's given explanation for the album's nonappearance was that it had been rendered \"broken\" in some manner, bandmate Kavus Torabi has since stated that, while the band did record around this time, the concept of a \"lost album\" was apocryphal. Cardiacs concerts were rare over the next few years, although the band played the Glastonbury Festival on 23 June 2000 and played two subsequent Whitchurch Festivals on 5 August 2000 and 3 August 2001.", "Counterbalancing the lack of tours, the band set up an annual tradition of one-off large-scale London concerts (the first of which took place on 11 November 2000 and the last in 2007). These usually took place in November at the London Astoria, and soon became a kind of Cardiacs family gathering in which the band was joined by various guests including former members and newer Cardiacs-inspired supported bands. During these concerts, Sarah Smith, William D. Drake, Christian Hayes and Dominic Luckman all appeared onstage with the band on various occasions, as did the Consultant and Miss Swift. Support bands were always musicians with a professed Cardiacs connection or influence, and included Oceansize, the Monsoon Bassoon, the Scaramanga Six, Stars in Battledress and Jon Poole's hard-rock band GodDamnWhores.", "Between 17\u201319 October 2003, Cardiacs recorded three special concerts at the Highbury Garage venue in London.

Smith would later perform as a live acoustic trio with Ginger Wildheart and former Cardiac Jon Poole. Around this time a \"Diary\" was begun and updated for the majority of 2005 on the official Cardiacs website, chronicling the band's exploits in typical absurd fashion. Three more annual Astoria gigs passed (the 2005 edition having been professionally shot, currently existing in an unedited state awaiting Tim Smith's involvement until 2007 when Cardiacs released their first new material for eight years: the Ditzy Scene single. Released on Org Records as a limited edition of 1,000 copies, Ditzy Scene was also the first release by the new lineup: on record this included Claire, Melanie, Cathy and Dawn, but the 2007 winter tour featured only Melanie and Cathy, both of whom were now playing percussion and singing.", "* Jon Poole \u2013 guitar, keyboards, vocals (1991\u20132003)", " bar:Poole     text:\"Jon Poole\"", "* Ablemesh (1990s art rock band which at various times featured Jon Poole, Bob Leith, Andy Allum and Sean D.

Their first album with drummer Bob Leith and their second as a four-piece, it was recorded throughout 1995, breaking a hiatus by the band that had lasted since the band's previous album Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992). During writing and recording, Jon Poole took a greater role than before, contributing to many songs written by band leader Tim Smith, and writing some of his own. The band decided to create a double album to encompass the great wealth of material written after their previous album. As with the band's previous albums, it presents a unique sound, and is seen as more eclectic than the band's previous albums, with one reviewer describing the record as \"essentially [taking] everything Cardiacs had always been and [ramping] it up to maximum,\" and another saying the album was where \"Smith's ability to express the music inside his head really began to transcend any sort of identifiable genre and turned Cardiacs into something truly unique.\"", "After Cardiacs released their fifth album On Land and in the Sea (1989), the group's line up drastically change; percussionist Tim Quy, keyboardist William D. Drake, saxophonist Sarah Smith and guitarist Bic Hayes all left the band. For the band's subsequent album Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992), the band became a four-piece, with Jon Poole replacing Bic Hayes' place on guitar during the sessions, and the results gave the album a more direct, heavier direction than the band's previous albums. The album was initially released on Rough Trade instead of the band's own label Alphabet Business Concern, who usually release the band's albums. However, as soon as the album was released, Rough Trade \"went under\" and closed, ceasing to exist, which put the band \"in a bit of a financial trap\".", "The band recorded the album between Spring and Winter 1995 at the London studio Apollo 8 Studios in Merritt Island and Sally Birthday House Studios, a studio of an unknown location described as simply being \"somewhere.\" Jon Poole recalled that \"Jim and Jane's\" house was a location for recording.\" Although the band have a status as a cult band, during recording, the band opened for Blur at Mile End Stadium and recorded a Radio 1 live session with Mark Radcliffe, which aired 24 April 1995, and a Lunchtime Acoustic Session broadcast live on GLR Radio on 16 May 1995. To fill the increasing gap between Cardiacs releases as Sing to God was not yet finished, a live album recorded in Salisbury in 1990, All That Glitters Is a Mares Nest, was released in 1995 to satisfy fans.", "The album sessions presented a change in Cardiacs' working methods.

In a 1996 interview, Smith said \"I really like the stuff [Poole]'s written, we all do. We're really dead lucky to have someone like him. He's written some great stuff for the new album.\" Poole recalled that \"this was a joyous and creative time and easily the best time I had in the band which is strange as I was going through upheaval in my personal life and had to keep walking off into the fields to have a good old blub but maybe this added to it all! We took the studio to Jim and Jane's place in the country. When I arrived there Jim and Jane were adding snipping sounds with garden tools to 'Wireless'. To this day I think it's one of Jane's proudest moments and I love hearing her tell other people about how surreal it was.\"", "The album also features material originally written for various other Cardiacs related projects.

Sam Shepherd opined that \"if you were to take a guess at what Smith was suggesting with this album it would simply be that the world is a magical, wondrous place, and that it is still possible to see it through a child's eyes.

The \"singalong craziness\" of \"Dog Like Sparky\" combines \"a tale of everyday pet disablement to a wonky oompah knees up\". Kitching called it a \"stupidly, almost overwhelmingly happy song with a playful blasphemy hidden in its heart (\"Put your hands on the Holy Bible and scream wank\") and an utterly demented keyboard refrain that sounds like a fleet of ice-cream vans chiming simultaneously.\" Shepherd noted that \"three songs in, and already there's been enough ideas thrown into the mix to fill most bands entire careers.\" \"Fiery Gun Hand\" keeps the pace of the album up and then \"floors the accelerator.
