One of the most enduring partnerships was that of Jed-Forest's Roy Laidlaw and Selkirk's John Rutherford. For nigh on a decade, the two were immovable at half-back for Scotland. Unlike most of the other famous pairings, however, it was Laidlaw and Rutherford's differences rather than their similarities, that melded them into an outstanding partnership. On the one hand, there was the peerless Rutherford, all grace and poise, who could glide through tackles and drill a ball onto a sixpence in the opposition's 22. On the other, there was Laidlaw, a gutsy fighter in the classic Borders mould. The pair played together on 35 occasions, a world record for a half-back partnership.\"Bath, pp 145-6"]}, {"page": "1985 Five Nations Championship", "response": ["|Roy Laidlaw/David Leslie"]}, {"page": "1983 Five Nations Championship", "response": ["|Jim Aitken/Roy Laidlaw", "|SH ||9 ||Roy Laidlaw (c)", "|SH ||9 ||Roy Laidlaw (c)", "|SH ||9 ||Roy Laidlaw (c)", "|SH ||9 ||Roy Laidlaw "]}, {"page": "1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand", "response": ["* Roy Laidlaw (Jedforest and Scotland) "]}]}}
