He was a regular for Arsenal's reserve side for two seasons before his first-team debut came, against West Bromwich Albion on 19 March 1921; Hopkins scored in a 4\u20133 victory and went on to play a further seven times that season. Injury and illness marred his 1921\u201322 season however, and he only played in 11 League games all season. The following season his appearances were even more sporadic, and despite scoring in both his League starts for Arsenal in 1922\u201323, he was sold to Brighton & Hove Albion in January 1923; in total he played 22 games for Arsenal, scoring seven goals.\nHopkins spent the next six seasons at Brighton, making over 200 League appearances in the Third Division South and scoring 72 goals. He also won a single cap for Ireland against England on 24 October 1925 at Windsor Park; the game finished 0\u20130. He left Brighton in 1929 and ended his career with Aldershot. He died in 1943.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Hopkins", "response": ["James Hopkins may refer to:", "*James Hopkins (footballer, born 1873) (1873\u2013?), English association football player for Manchester United", "*James Hopkins (footballer, born 1901) (1901\u20131943), Northern Irish association football player for Arsenal and Brighton"]}, {"page": "James Hopkins (footballer, born 1873)", "response": ["James Hopkins (born 1873) was an English footballer.
