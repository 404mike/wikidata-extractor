He travelled extensively to the Near East and Egypt and made an extensive individual collection of Egyptian artefacts. His work on Egypt, though not acknowledged until the 21st century, is regarded as important. He was a good friend of Lord Byron, Samuel Rogers and Sir Charles Barry. He served as Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Truro in 1810, for Cambridge University from 1822 to 1826, for Marlborough (the UK parliamentary constituency that his maternal grandfather, William Woodley, for whom he was named, had held from 1780 to 1784) from 1829 to 1832 and finally for Dorset from 1832 to 1835.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abydos, Egypt", "response": ["The long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties\u2014recognized by Seti\u2014are carved on a wall and known as the \"Abydos King List\" (showing the cartouche name of many dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from the first, Narmer or Menes, until Seti's time). There were significant names deliberately left off of the list. So rare, as an almost complete list of pharaoh names, the Table of Abydos, rediscovered by William John Bankes, has been called the \"Rosetta Stone\" of Egyptian archaeology, analogous to the Rosetta Stone for Egyptian writing, beyond the Narmer Palette.Misty Cryer, \"Travellers in Egypt \u2013 William John Bankes\" (2006), TravellersinEgypt.org, web: TravEgypt-WJB : re-discovered Table of Abydos."]}, {"page": "Rosetta Stone", "response": ["In 1814, Young first exchanged correspondence about the stone with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, a teacher at Grenoble who had produced a scholarly work on ancient Egypt. Champollion saw copies of the brief hieroglyphic and Greek inscriptions of the Philae obelisk in 1822, on which William John Bankes had tentatively noted the names \"Ptolemaios\" and \"Kleopatra\" in both languages.Parkinson et al.

On the same day he wrote the famous \"Lettre \u00e0 M. Dacier\" to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie, detailing his discovery. In the postscript Champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur in both Greek and Egyptian names, a hypothesis confirmed in 1823, when he identified the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches at Abu Simbel. These far older hieroglyphic inscriptions had been copied by Bankes and sent to Champollion by Jean-Nicolas Huyot. From this point, the stories of the Rosetta Stone and the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs diverge, as Champollion drew on many other texts to develop an Ancient Egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary which were published after his death in 1832.Dewachter (1990) p.\u00a045"]}, {"page": "Sidon", "response": ["* Helali\u00e9/Barami\u00e9/Mar Elias (William John Bankes, 1816; Renan 1864; Contenau, 1914; M.

Young and others would later use the fact that the Cleopatra cartouche had been identified by Bankes to claim that Champollion had plagiarized his work. It remains unknown whether Champollion saw Bankes' margin note identifying the cartouche or whether he identified it by himself. All in all, using this method he managed to determine the phonetic value of 12 signs (A, AI, E, K, L, M, O, P, R, S, and T).
