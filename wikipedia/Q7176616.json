Saunders' statistical analysis was also assessed by Hugh Noble, who published an article explaining statistical inference in \"The Spirit Level\" and assessing the critique offered by Peter Saunders. Noble concluded that the critical analysis of The Spirit Level offered by Peter Saunders 'cannot be taken seriously because it contains so many serious technical flaws'.Noble (2010), \"The Spirit Level Revisited - Regression Lines, Correlation, Outliers and Multivariate Analysis\", accessed 9 November 2019"]}]}}
