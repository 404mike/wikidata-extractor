The British government's Home Office, under the supervision of James Lester (Ben Miller) and Claudia Brown (Lucy Brown), becomes involved after a Gorgonopsid travels through one such anomaly and wreaks havoc in the Forest of Dean. Professor Cutter's wife, Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey), presumed dead for eight years, was revealed to have been travelling in time through the anomalies. Cutter was unable to convince her to help as she had changed much from the woman he had once known, and he began to fall in love with Claudia. Meanwhile, Abby began to take care of a Coelurosauravus she named Rex after he was left behind in the present, and was attracted to Stephen, who didn't completely reciprocate her feelings, despite Connor's romantic pursuit of her.

In episode 4.3, a mysterious woman goes through an Anomaly, Matt went after her because he assumed she was from the present, but upon returning her learnt that Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley) was from the Victorian era and had been living with other people throughout time. He was sympathetic towards her and kept her in his flat because he believed the ARC would treat her like a criminal and agrees to help her find her companion Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathan Byrne). But while he is dealing with another Anomaly she is kidnapped by Ethan so he goes to Lester, who helps him track her down and saves her life when she was trapped inside a coffin. In episode 4.6 he takes Emily to the anomaly site and admits to her that a disaster is going to happen because of the anomalies. He later saw Gideon (Anton Lesser), who was on the verge of death, and promised to use Emily as bait to catch Ethan since they suspected he was involved.

In the end he tells Emily that he is from the future, explaining that in his time everyone lives underground because the Earth is sterile and cannot support life. He and his father, Gideon, were sent back in time to help prevent that future from happening. At some point between the present time and Matt's time, an \"event\" happened which changed the way Anomalies appear and their effect on the Earth, making it a barren wasteland.

The mysterious cleaner is seen again by Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) in episode 2.4. Suspicious, he chases him, but is punched in the face by him, knocking him out. Later it is revealed that the man is working for Oliver Leek (Karl Theobald), who wants the team spied on \u2014 and Leek is working in cahoots with Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey). Many fans believed that the Cleaner's real name (or at least his surname) was Sciswell, due to mishearing part of Leek's conversation with Helen: \"I have a lot riding on this as well.\" In episode 2.5, he goes into an anomaly with two soldiers. When one of them protests about leaving a girl behind, the man responds, \"We're not social workers. Let someone else save her!\".

He finds Cutter, demanding him to hand over his water supplies, but is then attacked by another scorpion, because of the vibrations in the sand created when he fired his weapon, he is dragged down into the sand, with his last words being,  \"I'm a professional.

In the fifth series, Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) discovered an audio of Helen encouraging Philip to find a way to make the future better by using the anomalies. However, in the series finale Philip realised Helen had tricked him by stroking his ego, having intended for his attempt at making green energy with the anomalies to wipe out humans much like her later plan, likely done in case she failed in her attempt to wipe out early humans.", "Cutter started out as a somewhat aloof individual; for example he initially rather briskly brushes off Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) who comes to him with suspicions of a prehistoric creature being loose in modern times, telling him to go and get a girlfriend instead. He also keeps his encounter with his long lost wife, Helen, to himself. He can be quite spiteful at times as his last words to Stephen Hart (James Murray) before heading through the anomaly in episode 1.6 are to push Lester through the nastiest anomaly he can find if he does not make it back. He withholds information from his friends and teammates and Connor notes in episode 1.1 that he never turns up for his own seminars. He also tries to make demands of Lester in episode 1.3 he is ordered to bring Helen back only to be shocked when Lester overrules his decision and brings his wife back by force. Nick's attitude towards the Home Office involvement was at first one of mild contempt, at least for the more bureaucratic members such as Lester.

In episode 4.3 he is revealed to be dying because of an undisclosed illness, but had accepted his fate and wanted Matt to forget about him as he wasn't important. He wasn't happy in episode 4.5 when Matt risked everything to rescue Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley) from Ethan Dobrowski (Jonathan Byrne), and Gideon feared that Ethan was connected to their mission, and ordered Matt to use Emily as bait. By episode 4.6, he is close to death, and apologises to Matt for not allowing him to get close to anyone, as it was for everyone's own good, and before he died he asked Matt to complete their mission. Matt then revealed to Emily that Gideon was his father.

In episode 3.4 Mick stole an anomaly detector from Jenny's car and presented it to Katherine as it went off, and they decided to go to the location on it with a camera crew. At the airport site they found an anomaly, and Mick locked Jenny and Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) in another hangar after tricking them into believing they were attacked elsewhere. Mick and others filmed a juvenile Velociraptor that comes through the anomaly while Nigel Marven described it to them. A Giganotosaurus came through the anomaly and attacked, and the car Mick and Katherine hid in was flipped over. Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) and Connor pulled them out and both were locked in the other hangar as they were under arrest. Mick agreed to force the door open once Katherine agreed to give him a fair share of the merchandising once they had broke the story.

Katherine frantically filmed the Giganotosaurus as it was heading towards the anomaly, and inadvertently pushed Mick backwards through the anomaly, where they are presumably killed as Mick is heard screaming.", "In the first series, Stephen seemed to act as a punchbag for the monsters, often being badly injured or stranded on his own.

In Series 3, he allowed Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) to stay with him when Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) asked him to move out of her flat when her brother Jack (Robert Lowe) needed somewhere to stay, despite showing previous dislike towards him.

When Cutter was preparing to go back inside the burning ARC to look for Helen in episode 3.3, Jenny asked him not to go and thought it was a mistake, which is reference to what Claudia Brown said the last time Cutter saw her before going through the Permian Anomaly. Later, as Cutter was dying in Connor Temple's (Andrew-Lee Potts) arms, he started to ask Connor to tell Claudia something, but then changed his mind and said nothing. When Cutter dies as the ARC explodes, Jenny bursts into tears along with Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) and Connor, while Sarah watches on silently.

Guest stars throughout the series run include Tara Fitzgerald, Danny Dyer, Tiana Benjamin, Andrew-Lee Potts and Neil Dudgeon. Three series of the programme were broadcast, beginning with a two-part pilot episode on 29 September 2002. Due to strong viewing figures, a second series of six episodes - again, all two-part stories, was commissioned for broadcast in 2004, followed by a third series in 2005, which saw a slight change to the format, with each episode being self-contained, and the length of each episode extended. ITV chose not to re-commission the show for a fourth series. The series has never been released on DVD; however all three series have been released, free-to-view, on YouTube, via the programme's production company, All3 Media."]}, {"page": "London FrightFest Film Festival", "response": ["Friday: Time Crimes, King of the Hill (replacement for The Substitute), Trailer Park of Terror with Dir.
