Burke battered Papke, but used little science in his approach.

After the bout, Mantell tried to claim Papke's former British world middleweight title of June 11, 1911 taken from Jim Sullivan in London.

The two met again on 21 February 1916. Jimmy Wilde, the former Flyweight champion, described the fight as the most punishing he had ever seen. Both men fought as though their lives depended on it. The ring and spectators sitting nearby were splashed with blood by the end of the battle and it can be seen from photographs of the event that Sullivan's white shorts were dark with blood by the end of twenty rounds when O'Keeffe gained the decision. Two months later he fought Bandsman Blake and knocked him out in the thirteenth round.
