He wrote a number of plays, essays, and novels, but was never able to recapture the success of Three Men in a Boat. In 1892, he was chosen by Robert Barr to edit The Idler (over Rudyard Kipling). The magazine was an illustrated satirical monthly catering to gentlemen (who, following the theme of the publication, appreciated idleness). In 1893, he founded To-Day, but had to withdraw from both publications because of financial difficulties and a libel suit."]}, {"page": "Vehmic court", "response": ["The Vehmgericht also appear as antagonists in The Strong Arm, an 1899 novel set in the Holy Roman Empire by British-Canadian author Robert Barr."]}, {"page": "Stephen Crane", "response": ["Crane's later novels have not received as much critical praise. After the success of The Red Badge of Courage, Crane wrote another tale set in the Bowery.  George's Mother is less allegorical and more personal than his two previous novels, and it focuses on the conflict between a church-going, temperance-adhering woman (thought to be based on Crane's mother) and her single remaining offspring, who is a naive dreamer.Knapp, p. 86  Critical response to the novel was mixed.  The Third Violet, a romance that he wrote quickly after publishing The Red Badge of Courage, is typically considered as Crane's attempt to appeal to popular audiences.Gibson, p. 140  Crane considered it a \"quiet little story.\" Although it contained autobiographical details, the characters have been deemed inauthentic and stereotypical.Knapp, pp. 99\u2013100  Crane's second to last novel, Active Service, revolves around the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, with which the author was familiar.  Although noted for its satirical take on the melodramatic and highly passionate works that were popular of the nineteenth century, the novel was not successful.  It is generally accepted by critics that Crane's work suffered at this point due to the speed which he wrote in order to meet his high expenses.Knapp, p. 119  His last novel, a suspenseful and picaresque work entitled The O'Ruddy, was finished posthumously by Robert Barr and published in 1903.Gibson (1966), p. 145"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian writers", "response": ["| scope=\"row\" | Robert Barr"]}, {"page": "1912 in literature", "response": ["*October 21 \u2013 Robert Barr, Scottish Canadian short story writer and novelist (born 1849)"]}, {"page": "List of works published posthumously", "response": ["* Stephen Crane \u2014 The O'Ruddy (with Robert Barr)"]}, {"page": "William Arthur Dunkerley", "response": ["In February 1892 Robert Barr and Dunkerley founded The Idler, a monthly \"general interest magazine, one of the first to appear following the enthusiastic reception of The Strand, but not a slavish imitation\".

Written by the one-time Detroit Free Press journalist Robert Barr (known in the Press as 'Luke Sharp') it is both an indictment of an age gone by in which discipline and religion slide towards perversion and voyeurism, and a reminiscence of an innocent time before the great conflicts of the twentieth century, a time in which respect, delicacy and modesty prevailed in the relationships between man and woman, student and teacher. A complex and forgotten masterpiece of observation, whimsy and melodrama, it is reminiscent both of Mark Twain and Booth Tarkington.
