His first exhibit was a study of cattle by the River Thames, leading to a lifelong interest in painting animals.  In 1880 Wardle lived in Oakley Square, Camden, but artistic success enabled him to move to the more upmarket 34 Alma Square in St John's Wood by 1892.  Wardle was prolific; until 1936 he exhibited more than 100 works at the Royal Academy, as well as the Society of British Artists at Suffolk Street.  He painted a variety of animal subjects with equal skill but his work may be divided into two categories, domestic and exotic; animals from overseas including leopards, polar bears and tigers such as The Deer-Stealer (1915)  were painted from sketches that he made at London Zoo. He is considered equally proficient in oils, watercolours and pastels and was elected to the Pastel Society in 1911  and became a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1922.  In 1931 he held his first one-man exhibition at the Fine Art Society and in 1935 the Vicar's Gallery put on an exhibition of his work.  He also exhibited in Paris. By 1936 Wardle had moved to West London.\nHis career was highly successful and his works continue to be sought after and widely reproduced on postcards, calendars and boxes of chocolates.  He remains one of the widely known dog painters of the 19th and 20th centuries, and he is particularly known for his paintings of terriers. Wardle painted what is probably the best known painting of the fox terrier in its modern form, The Totteridge XI (1897).  The painting was commissioned by famed smooth fox terrier breeder Francis Redmond; Wardle painted a number of Redmond's dogs.  The original is in the gallery of The Kennel Club in London.\nArthur Wardle died on 16 July 1949.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Arthur Wardle (1864\u20131949)"]}, {"page": "The Kennel Club", "response": ["The Kennel Club Dog Art Gallery is located at the club's headquarters in Mayfair, London.

The painting is now owned by The Kennel Club, and is on display at their art gallery in London.", "The Totteridge XI was painted by experienced animal painter Arthur Wardle, and was commissioned by Fox Terrier breeder Francis Redmond. Redmond took a high level of interest in the painting, with Wardle remarking many years later, \"Mr Redmond stood over me and made me 'perfect' all his dogs \u2013 shorten their backs, lengthen their necks and muzzles, make their ears and feet smaller than they really were \u2013 and so on. None of them were half as good as in their picture\". Such were the corrections insisted upon by Redmond, that an outline of a completed painted over dog can be seen to the right of the painting, and where corrections were made to individual dogs, the original lines are still hazily visible."]}, {"page": "Rawdon Briggs Lee", "response": ["* History and Description of the Collie or Sheep Dog in his British Varieties, illustrated by Arthur Wardle (1890)", "* History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland \u2014 Non-sporting Division, illustrated by Arthur Wardle and R.
