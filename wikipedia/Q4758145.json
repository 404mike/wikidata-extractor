Ernest Hemingway, in a July 8, 1942, letter to his publisher Maxwell Perkins, said of the novel: \"I think it very, very good. It is as fine and good stuff to come out of Chicago.\" The novel offended members of Chicago's large Polish-American community, some of whose members denounced it as pro-Axis propaganda.

According to Nick Davies in Flat Earth News (2008), the paper originally intended an attack on the groups arguing for an inquiry into the Lawrence murder, but the paper's reporter Hal Austin, on interviewing Neville and Doreen Lawrence, realised that some years earlier, Neville had worked at Dacre's home in Islington as a plasterer, and the news desk instructed Austin to \"Do something sympathetic\" about the case.

A collection of scholarly articles, The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, and Cultural Theory edited by Cathy Schwichtenberg, was published in late 1992. The justification the creation of studies and bibliography focused on Madonna and validity that they have is a subject of debate among scholars and academics. These studies analyzed several topics, but mostly Madonna studies involved in the study of gender, sexuality, and the mass media. One of her advocates is Annalee Newitz saying that to \"the university communities Madonna occupies a definite place in the curriculum of post-Western cultures in universities worldwide\". Professor and media scholar John Fiske explained that all cultural studies focus primarily on finding a hidden meaning within a social aspect\u00a0\u2014for example, a Madonna video\u2014 so it takes a more comprehensive analysis to provide an appropriate context\u00a0\u2014in this case, on the work of singer\u2014. Similarly, the American psychologist Susan Fiske, noted that \"cultural studies about Madonna only analyze texts and how your audience uses the material to relate to the social construction that is Madonna.
