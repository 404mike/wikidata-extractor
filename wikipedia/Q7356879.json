Seymour shared in a defiant unbroken stand of 121 with Stuart Lampitt after Worcestershire had been forced to follow on. He accompanied Worcestershire on their 1993\u201394 tour of Zimbabwe, scoring 30 against a Matabeleland Invitation XI at Bulawayo. In 1994 he was almost a one-day specialist for Worcestershire, turning out in nine List A matches but only three first-class games; these were the last first-class matches of his career. A minor one-day highlight was his solitary wicket at first-team level: that of Norfolk's Rodney Bunting, whom he trapped lbw in a first-round NatWest Trophy match at Lakenham in June."]}]}}
