He replaced Jack Eastham as the club's regular left-back, and played 64 league games for the club from 1904 to 1907. He was an ever-present in the 1904\u201305 season, before he was replaced at left-back by Arthur Cowell by the 1905\u201306 campaign. He then signed with Chelsea for a \u00a3900 fee in October 1907, who had won promotion out of the Second Division in 1907, and would be appointed as Chelsea's captain. After maintaining their top-flight status in 1907\u201308 and 1908\u201309, the \"Pensioners\" were relegated in 1909\u201310. Cameron stayed at the club as they missed out on promotion by one place and two points in 1910\u201311, before he helped Chelsea to promotion as Second Division runners-up in 1911\u201312; they finished level on points with champions Derby County, who had a superior goal average. He then helped the club to finish one place above the relegation zone in 1912\u201313. He played a total of 179 league and 15 cup appearances for Chelsea."]}]}}
