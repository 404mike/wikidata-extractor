Like disco, Brit funk also represented a unique moment of fluidity in gender expression and sexuality. Britfunk was emerging in a time in the UK in which gender-play was entering the mainstream pop scene from strains of UK club scenes and formed around unique identity politics. Such politics were highly entangled with pleasure on the dance floor which was the essence of U.S. disco as well.
