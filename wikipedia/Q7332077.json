The star player was Dudley Tyler; Ronnie Radford and Ricky George's goals earned the club a Fourth Round tie against West Ham United where they were defeated in a replay at Upton Park. The Cup run played a part in the club's successful election to the Fourth Division, replacing Barrow."]}, {"page": "Ronnie Radford", "response": ["Radford's goal is sometimes incorrectly attributed as the winning goal; indeed the match actually went to extra time. It was substitute Ricky George who got the winner and wrote his name in the history books alongside Radford, as Hereford held out for an incredible 2\u20131 victory which is generally considered the greatest FA Cup shock of all time. The BBC quickly switched the match to the feature slot on Match of the Day, and Radford's goal was replayed countless times and was eventually voted Goal of the Season.

Described as the FA Cup's greatest ever giant killing Motson believed because of this game he was later given a 3-year deal.

But somehow he missed an open goal, much to the amusement of the Hereford supporters. He was to make up for this miss soon after when Viv Busby, on the Newcastle right, supplied a deep cross which Macdonald headed in at the far post to finally break the deadlock. With 8 minutes of normal time to go it seemed as if that would be the deciding goal, but Hereford responded by bringing on Ricky George for Roger Griffiths.

He found Tyler on the right who hit a powerful pass to Ricky George who took a couple of touches, then turned and shot. It evaded a last gasp challenge from Bobby Moncur, and went past McFaul into the far corner to spark another pitch invasion.

The club's most famous cup run came in the 1971\u201372 season when they played ten FA Cup matches, of which five were replays. In the Second Round it took Hereford two replays to defeat Northampton but the team waiting for them in the Third Round was none other than Newcastle of the First Division. Newcastle were held 2\u20132 at St James' Park before the replay at Edgar Street, which was covered by the BBC. Newcastle scored after 82 minutes through Malcolm Macdonald but then Ronnie Radford scored a 30-yard screamer at the Meadow End to make it 1\u20131, prompting a pitch invasion. Hereford had brought on Ricky George just minutes before, and it was George who scored the winner in extra time. Hereford had reached the Fourth Round for the first time in their history and their next opponents would be again First Division standard in the form of West Ham United. After a 0\u20130 draw at Edgar Street, the Bulls were finally knocked out of the FA Cup in the replay at Upton Park, losing 3\u20131 thanks to a Geoff Hurst hat-trick. Radford's goal subsequently became one of the most famous and televised goals ever and, coupled with the commentary of John Motson, it was voted Goal of the Season. In 2002, it ranked 97th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. Until recently the goal was featured in the opening credits for Match of the Day and the feat is always referred to by commentators and pundits when the FA Cup comes round each year. In their first season in the Football League Hereford finished runners-up to Southport in the Fourth Division and were promoted to the Third Division. The next two seasons saw Hereford finish eighteenth and twelfth before taking the Third Division title in 1975\u201376 \u2013 the club's greatest honour.
