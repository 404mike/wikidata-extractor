However, after a succession of players left the club, including popular goalkeeper Stephen Grindlay, defender Chris Boyle and winger Ryan Borris, McCabe found it hard to replace them. Lack of goals was evident in the league when new signings Brian McPhee and David McFarlane failed to hit the net on a regular basis. This led to Dumbarton sitting third bottom of the league. With only 3 wins out of 11 league games, McCabe was dismissed in November 2007 after only 18 months at the Strathclyde Homes Stadium."]}, {"page": "McFarlane (surname)", "response": ["*David McFarlane (footballer) (b. 1979), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "David McFarlane", "response": ["David McFarlane is the name of:", "* David McFarlane (footballer) (born 1979), Scottish footballer", "* David McFarlane (cyclist) (born 1959), Australian cyclist", "* David McFarlane (attorney), Canadian lawyer"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  David McFarlane"]}]}}
