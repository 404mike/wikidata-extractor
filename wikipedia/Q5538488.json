Initially, it did not concern itself with the motives of the offender. English courts first developed this test in the 1891 case In re Castolini,In re Castolini, [1891] 1 Q.B. 149. in which Switzerland sought the extradition of a man from Bellinzona who had shot dead a government official during political unrest there. The Extradition Act 1870 provided in general language for an exception to extradition for offences of a political character or offences for which extradition is sought to punish the offender for a political action, but the Act did not define those terms in detail. Judge George Denman formulated the two legs of the test for offences of a political character: first that the offence occurred during a political disturbance, and second that the offence was an overt act part of or incidental to the disturbance, and so ruled that Castolini could not be extradited."]}, {"page": "1872 Tiverton by-election", "response": ["The Tiverton by-election of 1872 was fought on 4 November 1872.
