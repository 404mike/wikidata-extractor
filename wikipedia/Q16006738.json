A small party tried without success, followed by six men, singly, each one being killed in the attempt. Private Counter then volunteered and, going out under terrific fire, got through and returned with vital information which enabled his commanding officer to organise and launch the final successful counter-attack. Subsequently, he also carried five messages across the open under heavy artillery barrage to company headquarters.Counter left the army in 1921 with the rank of corporal. His medal is on display at the Jersey Museum, Saint Helier.", "link_mentions": {}}}
