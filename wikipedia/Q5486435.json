He is distinguished for leading the London Irish across no man's land to storm enemy trenches kicking a football ahead of the troops. The successful capture of enemy positions that followed earned the London Irish Rifles their second battle honour, Loos, 1915. The football is still preserved in the regimental museum of the London Irish and to this day the memory of Edwards is commemorated on Loos Sunday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank Edwards", "response": ["Frank Edwards may refer to:", "*Frank Edwards (Australian politician) (1887\u20131983), Australian politician", "*Frank Edwards (blues musician) (1909\u20132002), American blues musician", "*Frank Edwards (British Army soldier) (1893\u20131964), British Army soldier", "*Frank Edwards (British politician) (1852\u20131927), British Liberal Party politician ", "*Frank Edwards (communist) (1907\u20131983), Irish teacher and communist", "*Frank Edwards (cricketer) (1885\u20131970), English cricketer", "*Frank Edwards (gospel musician) (born 1989), Nigerian gospel musician", "*Frank Edwards (Illinois politician) (1950-2020), American local politician", "*Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster) (1908\u20131967), American writer and broadcaster", "* Sir Francis Edwards, 1st Baronet (1852\u20131927, commonly known as Frank Edwards), British politician"]}, {"page": "London Irish Rifles", "response": ["At the Battle of Loos, the 1st Battalion LIR particularly distinguished itself.
