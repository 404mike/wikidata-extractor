He played for Derbyshire from 1973 to 1986, captaining the side from 1979 to 1981 (following the sudden resignation of David Steele after six weeks in the role), and returned in 1990 after playing for Essex between 1987 and 1989. He was an England selector from 2008 to 2013 and was appointed President of Derbyshire C.C.C. in March 2014.\nThe cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, \"Geoff Miller concedes that he probably enjoyed cricket too much. He did not take it as seriously as some, And when it became a rigorous, grim-faced business, he was not sorry to bow out of an eight-year Test career that never reached the peaks many expected\". Likewise Simon Hughes referred to Miller in 1990 as being \"the only remaining player who unfailingly visited the opposing team's dressing room after play to thank them for the game ...

His d\u00e9but was somewhat overshadowed by the return from self-imposed Test exile of Geoffrey Boycott. England went into the match with a 1\u20130 series lead having won the second Test after the first had been drawn. The series was played against the background of the so-called \"Packer Affair\" which resulted in the establishment of World Series Cricket in the next Australian season. Because of Tony Greig's involvement, he had been stripped of the England captaincy but remained in the team under new captain Mike Brearley. England had three all-rounders at Trent Bridge with Greig, Geoff Miller and Botham all playing. Australian captain Greg Chappell won the toss and decided to bat first. Australia scored 243 and were all out shortly before the close on day one. Botham, aged 21, made an immediate impact and took five for 74, the highlight being the wicket of Chappell, bowled for just 19. England batted all through day two and into day three as Boycott, in his first Test innings since 1974, and Knott both made centuries. Botham came in at number eight on day three and scored 25 before he was bowled by Max Walker. England were all out not long afterwards for 364, a first innings lead of 121. Botham had no joy in Australia's second innings with none for 60. A century by Rick McCosker enabled Australia to score 309 before they were all out in the evening session on day four. Bob Willis took five for 88. England needed 189 to win and completed the job, by seven wickets, well into the final day with Brearley scoring 81 and Boycott, who batted on all five days, 80 not out.

Although there had been three first-class warm-up fixtures, Taylor had not impressed with the bat and had been rotated out of the second game in order for Paul Downton to have a chance at the gloves.
