He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1878, and a Royal Academician in 1881, and received the degree of Doctor of Civil Law at Oxford in 1891. He was narrowly defeated in the election for President of the Royal Academy in 1896. His wife, Mary Alice Rivi\u00e8re (n\u00e9e Dobell; 1844\u20131931) whom he married in 1867, was a painter and exhibited briefly at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1869\u201370. After his death she presented the British Museum with four of his drawings (and an etching \"The king drinks\"), which complements the dozens of prints made after his work housed there, especially by Frederick Stacpoole and William Henry Simmons. The artist and his wife had seven children; five sons and two daughters. One of the sons, Hugh Goldwin Rivi\u00e8re (1869\u20131956), became a portraitist; another son (Evelyn) married the eminent psychoanalyst and translator of Sigmund Freud known as Joan Riviere."]}, {"page": "Stacpoole", "response": ["*Frederick Stacpoole (1813\u20131907), English engraver"]}]}}
