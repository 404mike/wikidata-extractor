Baird was then appointed in 1971 as medical lecturer at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital. Her Professor John Strong asked Baird to set up one of the first clinics specifically designed for the management of patients with diabetes and endocrine conditions. Baird started the Metabolic Unit with close working between laboratory and clinical consultations not practical in a normal hospital ward. Baird developed this service to cover endocrine science, calcium metabolism, osteoporosis and other research, such as studying and treating diabetes in pregnancy, the impact of familial factors and obesity. Baird also collaborated closely with Anne Cooke, a leading immunologist working on animal models of disease and treatment, based in Cambridge."]}]}}
