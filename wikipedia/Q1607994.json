His loyalty to Bomber Harris, however, was evidenced more dramatically after the war, when Paynter was director of intelligence at the Air Ministry. Incensed by the Attlee Government's refusal to give Harris a place in the victory celebrations, he resigned his commission in protest. His decision meant losing \u00a3100 from his annual pension \u2013 a more significant sacrifice then than it sounds today. He was soon found a new job, however, as a director of MI5, and remained a senior officer with the Security Service until retiring at the age of 62 in the early 1960s."]}, {"page": "British official war artists", "response": ["*Herbert Arnould Olivier, 1861\u20131952."]}, {"page": "Herbert Arnold Olivier", "response": ["#REDIRECT Herbert Arnould Olivier"]}, {"page": "List of Old Shirburnians", "response": ["* Herbert Arnould Olivier, artist"]}, {"page": "Olivier (surname)", "response": ["* Herbert Arnould Olivier (1861\u20131952), English painter, uncle of Laurence Olivier"]}, {"page": "War Artists' Advisory Committee", "response": ["* Herbert Arnould Olivier"]}, {"page": "Albert du Roy de Blicquy", "response": ["He made a career at the Belgian royal Court and was Aide-de-camp to the Count of Flanders between 1898-1900.
