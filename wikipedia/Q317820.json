He is a seven-time Grand Slam doubles winner, a Davis Cup champion, and a former doubles world No. 1. Murray is the elder brother of former singles world No. 1 tennis player, Andy Murray.He has won seven Grand Slam titles: in mixed doubles at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, with Jelena Jankovi\u0107, the 2017 Wimbledon Championships and 2017 US Open, with Martina Hingis, and the 2018 and 2019 US Open, with Bethanie Mattek-Sands, and in men's doubles at the 2016 Australian Open and 2016 US Open with Bruno Soares.\nMurray had an early career partnership with Eric Butorac, winning three titles in 2007. His following seven ATP finals came with six different partners. In 2013, he began a new partnership with John Peers, winning six ATP tournaments, and reaching two Grand Slam men's doubles finals. After the partnership split up, Murray joined with Bruno Soares for the 2016 Tour, the new pair enjoying almost immediate success after winning only their second ATP tournament playing together. The pair went on to win the 2016 Australian and US Opens, and Murray reached the world no. 1 doubles ranking.\nMurray was in the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup in 2015, the nation's first championship in the tournament for 79 years. With his brother Andy, he won the doubles matches in Britain's quarterfinal, semifinal and final victories.\nThe Davis Cup team was awarded the 2015 BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award.Brad Gilbert, who coached Andy Murray, gave Jamie the name 'Stretch' because of his 6-foot-3-inch height and long arms.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Jamie Murray (born 1986), tennis player, doubles, Wimbledon winner 2007 mixed doubles"]}, {"page": "Lleyton Hewitt", "response": ["Hewitt played the Davis Cup match against Great Britain in the semi-finals of the 2015 Davis Cup.
