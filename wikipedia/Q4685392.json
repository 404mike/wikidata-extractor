Letters dated to the end of 1661 note that in addition to the Tangier project, Charles II had also sought Wren for consultation regarding repairs to Old St Paul's Cathedral, the reconstruction of which would ultimately be the architect's magnum opus. Speaking of Wren's vocational transition from academic to architect-engineer, biographer Adrian Tinniswood writes \"the use of mathematicians in military fortification was not unusual... Perhaps Wren also had experience of the business of fortification, more than we know.\"", "Wren's second, similarly collegiate work followed soon after, when he was commissioned to design Oxford's \"New Theatre,\" financed by Gilbert Sheldon. His design for the structure was met with lukewarm to negative reception, with even Wren's defenders admitting the young architect to have not yet been \"capable of handling a large architectural composition with assurance.\" Adrian Tinniswood credits the building's flaws to \"Sheldon\u2019s refusal to pay for an elaborate exterior, Wren\u2019s inability to find an adequate external expression for a building which was wholly conditioned by the functionality of its interior space and, ...his refusal to bend the knee to classical authority in the way that our experience of eighteenth-century architecture has conditioned us to believe is right.\" Prior to the theatre's 1669 completion, Wren had received further commissions for the Garden Quadrangle at Trinity College, Oxford and the chapel of Emmanuel College, Cambridge."]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["* Adrian Tinniswood, The Verneys: A True Story of Love, War, and Madness in Seventeenth-Century England"]}, {"page": "Barbary pirates", "response": ["According to historian Adrian Tinniswood, the most notorious corsairs were European renegades who had learned their trade as privateers, and who moved to the Barbary Coast during peacetime to pursue their trade.

Infamous corsair Henry Mainwaring, who was initially a lawyer and pirate-hunter, later returned home to a royal pardon. Mainwaring later wrote a book about the practise of piracy in the Mediterranean, aptly titled the Discourse of Pirates.

Verney, as told by the Verney family, found refuge with another relative, Richard Giffard, who was captain of the Fortune, commanding what was essentially a pirate fleet, and Verney is mentioned among his officers. This part of the story was disputed by British historian Adrian Tinniswood who claimed that Giffard was imprisoned in Florentine captivity from 1607 to 1610. Regardless of who served as his pirating mentor, within two years he had become one of the most feared pirates on the Barbary Coast \"making havoc of his own countrymen, and carrying into Algiers prizes belonging to the merchants of Poole and Plymouth\"Cordingly, David.

His own family considered his becoming a Catholic later in life only \"barely preferable\" to Islam.
