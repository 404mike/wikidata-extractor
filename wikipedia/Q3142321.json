He landed many times at clandestine airfields in occupied France to insert and extract SOE agents. He was decorated for gallantry five times.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Special Operations Executive", "response": ["The procedure once a Lysander reached its destination in France was described by Squadron Leader Hugh Verity. Once the aircraft reached the airfield the agent on the ground would signal the aircraft by flashing a prearranged code letter in Morse. The aircraft would respond by blinking back the appropriate code response letter. The agent and his men would then mark the field by lighting the three landing lights, which were flashlights attached to poles. The \"A\" lamp was at the base of the landing ground. 150 metres beyond it and into the wind was the \"B\" light, and 50 metres to the right of \"B\" was the \"C\" light. The three lights formed an inverted \"L\", with the \"B\" and \"C\" lights upwind from \"A\". With the code passed the pilot would land the aircraft. He then would taxi back to the \"A\" lamp, where the passengers would clamber down the fixed ladder to the ground, often while the pilot was making a slow U-turn. Before leaving the last passenger would hand off the luggage and then take aboard the outgoing luggage before climbing down the ladder as well. Then the outgoing passengers would climb aboard and the aircraft would take off. The whole exchange might take as little as 3 minutes.", "The Lockheed Hudson had a range  greater and could carry more passengers (ten or more), but required landing strips three times as long as those needed for the Lysander (450 yards vs. 150 yards). It carried a navigator, to ease the load on the pilot, and could also be fitted with navigational equipment such as the \"Rebecca\" homing transceiver of the Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar system. The Hudson's use with 161 Squadron was developed by Charles Pickard and Hugh Verity. Pickard determined that the Hudson's stall speed was actually some 20\u00a0mph slower than its manual stated. Before it was first used on 13 January 1943, 161 Squadron had to send two Lysander aircraft in what they termed \"a double\" if larger parties needed to be picked up."]}, {"page": "Westland Lysander", "response": ["The high-lift devices gave the Lysander a short take off and landing (STOL) performance much appreciated by the Special Duties pilots such as Squadron Leader Hugh Verity. The wings were equipped with automatic slats which lifted away from the leading edge as the airspeed decreased towards stalling speed. These slats controlled automatic flaps. Slow speed flight was therefore greatly simplified, \"and it was possible to bring a Lysander down to land, if not like a lift, at least like an escalator\".Verity 1978 p. 15 The inboard slats were connected to the flaps and to an air damper in the port wing which governed the speed at which the slats operated. The outboard slats operated independently and were not connected and each was fitted with an air damper. On a normal approach, the inboard slats and the flaps would begin to open when the airspeed has dropped to about  and be approximately half down at . The only control that the pilot has is a locking lever which he can set to lock the flaps down once they have been lowered automatically.Wake-Walker 2014 p. 64", "* Lysander IIIA on static display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in Duxford, Cambridgeshire.

The Germans having occupied the previously unoccupied zone of France, SOE wanted to review its plans with CARTE and demanded in a message on 12 November (received via Adolphe Rabinovitch, radio operator of the SPINDLE network) that Girard return to London. Several pick-up attempts that December failed and Frager prepared a report criticising Girard, to be transmitted to London, but Girard found out and also noted the good relations between Frager and Peter Churchill. In January\u2013February 1943, Girard put off his departure for London indefinitely, before finally being picked up by a Hudson on the night of 21/22 February. Frager and Churchill were picked up by Lysander on the night of 23/24 March (landing at Estr\u00e9es-Saint-Denis near Compi\u00e8gne, piloted by Hugh Verity, flying in Francis Cammaerts and Georges Duboudin) and joined Girard in London. However, Girard refused to meet them and SOE distanced itself from Girard, opposing his return to France and warning Frager that he would have to lead what remained of the CARTE network against Hugo Bleicher (known as \"colonel Henri\") .", "On the night of 14/15 April 1943 Frager was returned to France by Lysander (BRONCHITE drop zone, near Tours) and welcomed back by Henri D\u00e9ricourt (GILBERT). He flew to London again on 20/21 October 1943 (in a Hudson, from the ACHILLE landing strip near Angers), but his pick-up had been organised by D\u00e9ricourt, now under Sicherheitsdienst surveillance. An altercation occurred before this between Frager and D\u00e9ricourt over breakfast in a caf\u00e9 facing Angers' train station. Frager had brought along his substitute and friend, Roger Bardet (in fact released from prison by Bleicher in exchange for Bardet feeding him information, a promise Bardet seems to have kept), to assist in his departure for London, but D\u00e9ricourt forbade him from doing so. Frager also believed D\u00e9ricourt to be a Gestapo agent and D\u00e9ricourt suspected that Frager thought as much. Hugo Bleicher wrote in his book of his recruitment of Roger Bardet as V-Mann, and how Bardet had got into Frager's good books by revealing to him that D\u00e9ricourt was a double agent working for Kieffer. There was no sympathy between Bleicher (and the Abwehr) and Kieffer (of the SD).

Being a secret organisation, recruitment was a problem. Some pilots were drawn to the SD squadrons by personal contacts, others by the pilot's own experience in escaping from the continent. All of them had an \"Above Average\" pilot rating. Many had also qualified as navigators. Self-reliance in navigation was an important quality for the SD pilots. Many judged it a more essential skill for a successful SD pilot than piloting the aircraft itself. A pilot had to fly in the dark of night over enemy occupied territory, frequently in weather that grounded other squadrons, and navigate by himself to a small dark field in the middle of France. Pilots had to be self-reliant, capable of thinking and acting on their own. Hugh Verity wrote a set of instructions for the Lysander pilots in A Flight of 161 Squadron. These were guides offered from an experienced Lysander pilot to the novitiate, but were more helpful tips rather than a set of hard fast rules. 161 Squadron did not have rigid rules they followed, as conditions and obstacles such as bad weather, low cloud and fog, boggy landing fields, or possible enemy action were too variable. As 161 Squadron commander Charles Pickard often remarked: \"There's always bloody something!\"", "thumb|A group of 161 pilots stand before Verity's Lysander in 1943 (Jimmy McCairns, Hugh Verity, Charles Pickard, Peter Vaughan-Fowler, and Bunny Rymills)", "Underdeveloped, Tempsford was not a typical RAF airfield. It did have the standard three runways laid out at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern, and a perimeter track which circled the field's dispersals. Hugh Verity, the former commanding officer of 161 Squadron's A Flight,  described it as \"not much of an RAF station.\" RAF Tempsford was designed to look like an ordinary working farm. SOE agents were lodged in a local hotel before being brought to Tempsford's farm buildings. No one was allowed to see, let alone speak to, the agents being ferried to France. One of the buildings was brick built, but had wood siding framed around the structure to disguise it. This structure was commonly referred to as the Gibraltar Farm. It was very unusual for any structure to be standing within the perimeter track of an RAF airfield, but at Tempsford the Gibraltar Farm and a number of other farm buildings were located there. After final briefings and checks at the farm, the agents were issued firearms in the barn, and then boarded onto an awaiting aircraft flown by one of a team of pilots.", "The use of the Hudson for pick-up operations missions was developed by Charles Pickard and Hugh Verity. By trial flights Pickard learned that the Hudson's stall speed was actually some 20\u00a0mph slower than what was stated in the plane's manual. Pickard showed Verity how to land a Hudson short, and together they worked out the operating procedures that enabled this twin-engined aircraft to operate to fields in occupied France. This gave the squadron the ability to carry in and bring out groups of as many as ten people in one mission using a single aircraft.", "The SD pilots and aircrew received little recognition for the work they did, and certainly not at the time they were doing it. But the men that made up the special duties air units were a breed apart. As pilots they tended to be self-sufficient, able to problem solve and act on their own. Though excellent pilots and natural navigators, Hugh Verity offered that many would not have been as well suited to  regular RAF officer duties. The pilots had to possess a certain intangible quality. The life of the special operations airman was that of the lone wolf."]}, {"page": "Peter Vaughan-Fowler", "response": ["thumb|Moved forward for the \"moon period\", the 'A Flight' at RAF Tangmere: Jimmy McCairns, Hugh Verity, CO Charles Pickard, Peter Vaughan-Fowler and Frank Rymills", "The squadron received new flight leader Hugh Verity on 15 November 1942.
