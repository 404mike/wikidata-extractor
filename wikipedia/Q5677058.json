He also appeared in films between 1920\u20131938.Braban performed regularly in West End plays, and also occasionally on Broadway. From 1920 he began appearing in silent films made by the leading British studios Stoll Pictures and the Ideal Film Company. Braban played the Chief Inspector in Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail (1929) and thereafter often portrayed policemen or other official figures of authority on screen. One of his final roles was that of the Victorian Prime Minister Lord Salisbury in the 1938 film Sixty Glorious Years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blackmail (1929 film)", "response": ["* Harvey Braban as the Chief Inspector (sound version)", "The film was a critical and commercial hit. The sound was praised as inventive. A completed silent version of Blackmail was released in 1929 shortly after the talkie version hit theaters. The silent version of Blackmail actually ran longer in theaters and proved more popular, largely because most theaters in Britain were not yet equipped for sound. Despite the popularity of the silent version, history best remembers the landmark talkie version of Blackmail. It is the version now generally available although some critics consider the silent version superior. Alfred Hitchcock filmed the silent version with Sam Livesey as the Chief Inspector and the sound version with Harvey Braban in the same role."]}, {"page": "Alibi (1931 film)", "response": ["* Harvey Braban  as  Inspector Davis  "]}, {"page": "Keep Your Seats, Please", "response": ["* Harvey Braban as Detective Jones"]}, {"page": "Shirley (1922 film)", "response": ["* Harvey Braban as Nunnally"]}, {"page": "Sixty Glorious Years", "response": ["*Harvey Braban as Lord Salisbury"]}, {"page": "The Path of Glory", "response": ["* Harvey Braban as Colonel Conti"]}, {"page": "Sam Livesey", "response": ["Livesey had a successful film career encompassing both the silent and sound era.
