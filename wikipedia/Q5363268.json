Critics have suggested it is precisely because Schubert had minimal opportunity to see his late dramatic works performed during his lifetime that he lacked the perspective, and that which might have been revealed by it, available to other composers such as Beethoven who revised Fidelio on multiple occasions after public performance, to judge his operas from a distance. Elizabeth Norman McKay has noted how Schubert incorporated his understanding of the music of Gioachino Rossini into the opera. German musicologist Till Gerrit Waidelich has published a monograph on the opera, detailing its history in composition and performance."]}, {"page": "Euryanthe", "response": ["Only the overture, an outstanding example of the early German Romantic style (heralding Richard Wagner), is regularly played today. Like Schubert's lesser-known Alfonso und Estrella, of the same time and place (Vienna, 1822), Euryanthe parts with the German Singspiel tradition, adopting a musical approach without the interruption of spoken dialogue characteristic of earlier German language operas such as Mozart's Die Zauberfl\u00f6te, Beethoven's Fidelio, and Weber's own Der Freisch\u00fctz.Elizabeth Norman McKay,  \"Alfonso und Estrella\", Grove Music Online ed.

On March 26, 1828, together with other musicians in Vienna, Schubert gave a public concert of his own works, which was a great success and earned him a considerable profit. In addition, two new German publishers took an interest in his works, leading to a short period of financial well-being. However, by the time the summer months arrived, Schubert was again short of money and had to cancel some journeys he had previously planned.Elizabeth Norman McKay, Franz Schubert: A Biography, pp. 291\u2013318; Peggy Woodford, Schubert, pp. 136\u2013148."]}, {"page": "Anna Milder-Hauptmann", "response": ["Kreutzer wrote his monodrama Adele von Budoy (1821, in 1823 revived as Cordelia with Wilhelmine Schr\u00f6der-Devrient) for Milder.\"Kreutzer, Conradin.\" by Peter Branscombe in Grove Music Online  Franz Schubert wrote the lied \"Der Hirt auf dem Felsen\", D. 965, for Milder-Hauptmann which she premiered in Riga on 10 February 1830 and later that year also sang in Berlin.
