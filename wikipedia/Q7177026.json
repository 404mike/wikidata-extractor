He has been involved in music since 1985, most notably as guitarist with The Wedding Present from its inception until 1991, and then with The Ukrainians till the present day.\nThe Wedding Present was formed when Peter joined with old school friend David Gedge, Keith Gregory and Shaun Charman. The band released many EPs and singles as well as three successful albums. \n\nGeorge Best (1987)\nBizarro (1989)\nSeamonsters (1991)The group performed at major festivals, appeared in national and indie charts, plus TV shows. During this time, Peter developed an interest in his ethnic roots and worked with the band to produce an album of Ukrainian-inspired music. They were helped in this by Roman Remeynes, Len Liggins . The album featured for the first time in three John Peel Sessions. It was later released by RCA records.\n\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0412\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438 \u0432 \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0456\u043b\u0430 (1989)The album reached no 22 in the national album charts - a record for an Eastern European language record in the UK. The interest in the music was such that RCA requested another Ukrainian album. Throughout 1990, the band were working on 2 albums (Seamonsters and the new Ukrainian album) and this caused tensions between individual band members. Both albums were finished in early 1991, after which it was decided that it would be best if Peter concentrated on the Ukrainian music.\nThe RCA album recorded by The Wedding Present was released as The Ukrainians first album  \n\nThe Ukrainians (1991)After leaving the Wedding Present, Peter formed The Ukrainians with Roman Remeynes, Len Liggins and Stepan Pasicznyk.
