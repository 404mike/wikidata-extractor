Subsequently, he studied under Fanny Waterman and won several awards early in his career, including the Gold Medal at the 1989 Arthur Rubinstein Piano Competition in Israel. He also won the Dudley Piano Competition aged only 14. He has appeared with many of the world\u2019s finest orchestras including the Berlin Symphony, Israel Philharmonic, City of Birmingham Symphony, Polish National Radio, and the BBC Philharmonic. He has worked with many leading conductors such as Zubin Mehta, Antoni Wit, Vasary, Skrowaczewski, Bamert, Atzman and Barry Wordsworth.\nHis repertoire ranges from Bach to Tippett and includes over 50 concertos. He has recorded all the John Field piano concertos (during 2002, numbers 5 & 6 reached the top of the classical charts) and since then has recorded all of Field\u2019s nocturnes for solo piano. His disc of Schumann\u2019s Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze was chosen as the top recommendation on the Radio 3 \u201cBuilding a Library\u201d programme. Five of his discs are represented in the Gramophone \u2013 Best CD Guide and in response to his recording of the Beethoven Diabelli Variations, Gramophone critic Richard Osborne wrote, \u201che possesses a formidable talent both musically and technically. Indeed, I would go as far as to suggest that there has not been a finer Diabelli on record by a young pianist since the classic recording by the twenty eight year old Stephen Kovacevich in 1968\u201d. A recent recording of a selection of Scarlatti Sonatas was described in the BBC Music Magazine as follows: \u201cBenjamin Frith is an inspired choice for the fifth disc of the Naxos cycle; a compelling advocate of the piano, he transports the music to the new medium, capitalising on the piano\u2019s ability to pick out a strand, shape dynamics and bathe textures in subtle pedalling, without ever misrepresenting Scarlatti \u2013 a disc to convert the most die-hard authenticist\u201d.\nHe is a member of the Gould Piano Trio and is a tutor at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dinnington High School", "response": ["* Benjamin Frith, concert pianist"]}, {"page": "Frith (surname)", "response": ["* Benjamin Frith, British pianist"]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists (recorded)", "response": ["* Benjamin Frith"]}, {"page": "Fanny Waterman", "response": ["Waterman's notable students include Paul Crossley, Jonathan Dunsby, Benjamin Frith, Michael Roll and Allan Schiller; Roll won the inaugural Leeds competition and her students were also successful in other international competitions.
