The selectors famously fielded a weakened side for the trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers in a league game a week before the two sides met in the cup final and won 4\u20132. Only four of that team appeared the following week at the cup final as Boyle and Latta were joined by Kelso, having re-established himself in defence ahead of Collins and Stewart who had taken over after Jamieson had left for Sheffield Wednesday the previous month. The major selection surprise was that Patrick Gordon was selected ahead of Fred Geary in attack. The game became farce when the fans encroached onto the woefully inadequate field at Fallowfield in Manchester and made it impossible for Latta and Milward to use their wing play to proper effect, the latter being physically tripped by a spectator on one occasion. Wolves won the game in the second half when Harry Allen's hopeful punt deceived Dick Williams who lost the ball in the sun. Everton were furious though that Allen had received the ball from a spectator who had kicked the ball of Dickie Boyle's toe as the Everton half was taking the ball away from danger and felt that the game should have been reduced to the level of a friendly with the cup being played for at a later date. The game would leave a bad taste in the mouths of every Evertonian for over a decade until they finally did win the cup in 1906."]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Harry Allen"]}]}}
