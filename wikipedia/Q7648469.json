Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul of 79 BC); and Gaius Claudius Pulcher (the consul of 92 BC), have been postulated by Ronald Syme. Susan Treggiari has speculated that his mother might have been a sister of Marcus Livius Drusus the tribune, this explaining his adoption by Drusus, since Drusus had at least two other nephews whom he chose Claudianus over. Adopted fathers and sons were often closely relatedOlli Salomies, Adoptive and Polyonymous Nomenclature in the Roman Empire (Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1992), p. 35 and adoption of a sororal nephew was especially common in Rome."]}, {"page": "Servilia (wife of Catulus)", "response": ["Servilia was most likely the daughter and oldest child of Quintus Servilius Caepio the consul of 106 BC. She was the sister of another Quintus Servilius Caepio and Servilia, the wife of Marcus Livius Drusus. Their mother is uncertain but was likely a Caecilia Metella. The historian Edward Courtney identified her as Cato the Younger's half-sister Servilia, but this is unlikely. Yet another theory was by Brunt who believed her to be the sister of the consul of 106, but Susan Treggiari thinks this is less probable than her being his daughter."]}, {"page": "Servilia (wife of Lucullus)", "response": ["There is some debate as to who her father was. Older authors who follow Plutarch deem her to be the daughter of Quintus Servilius Caepio and Livia, thus the younger full sister of Servilia Major and Gnaeus Servilius Caepio and half-sister to Cato the Younger and Porcia. Some modern historians such as Susan Treggiari tend to believe that she was actually the daughter of Gnaeus Servilius Caepio, thus a niece of Cato; but this is not universally accepted, Judith P. Hallett has argued that is implausible that the younger Caepio (who was born in 98 BC) would have married so young and sired a daughter fast enough that she would be old enough to marry Lucullus in 66 BC."]}, {"page": "Quintus Volusius Saturninus", "response": ["Surviving inscriptions indicate that a burial club of his slaves and freedmen operated a columbarium on the Appian Way.Susan Treggiari, \"Family Life Among the Staff of the Volusii\", Transactions of the American Philological Association, 105 (1975), pp. 393-401 Tacitus describes Saturninus as a man of aristocratic status.", "*Susan Treggiari, \"Family Life among the Staff of the Volusii\", Transactions of the American Philological Association, 105 (1974-1975)"]}, {"page": "Publius Claudius Pulcher (son of Clodius)", "response": ["There has also been some speculation among historians such as George Patrick Goold that he might have been the father of Claudia Pulchra who was the daughter of Augustus' niece Claudia Marcella Minor. Some historians such as Ronald Syme have rejected this proposal while others like Susan Treggiari are open to the possibility. Another interpretation put forth is that Claudia Pulchra was indeed Publius daughter, but by Claudia Marcella Major, the elder sister of Claudia Marcella Minor. Goold argues that an engagement between Publius and Marcella would have fit the political climate around 43 BC when Octavian himself was marrying Pulcher's sister Claudia. He conjectures that the future emperor might have reasoned that betrothing his niece to a son of a plebeian hero would have its advantages after his experience with the Pseudo-Marius."]}, {"page": "List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1995", "response": ["| Susan Treggiari||Humanities||Classics"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Classics, University of Oxford", "response": ["*Susan Treggiari"]}, {"page": "List of presidents of the American Philological Association", "response": ["| 1997 || Susan Treggiari || "]}, {"page": "Miriam T.
