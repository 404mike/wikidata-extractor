His television career began with a live 'on-air' audition as a continuity announcer for Tyne Tees Television. He also announced for HTV (forerunner of ITV Wales and West) before joining BBC North West in 1974. Mundy worked as a regional continuity announcer on weekday evenings and presented news bulletins, alternating duties with Christine Burn.\nMundy stayed with BBC North West after regional continuity was axed in September 1980 and later became a main anchor of Look North West and North West Tonight,  until 1995. He also worked on various non-news programmes including The Friday Show, The Young Enterprise Show, Christmas Crackers and annual North West coverage of the BBC's Children in Need appeal.\nDuring his time with the BBC (and largely unknown to the BBC or public), Mundy was also running a parallel career as a highly successful voice-over artist.\nIn 1995, Mundy took a career break and went to live in the USA. For the next five years he was involved in property development which included owning and operating two hotels in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 2000, he returned to live in Britain and resumed his work as a voice-over artist.\nIn February, 2014, John was chosen to be the Station and Promotion voice of the now internationally-available LBC News and Talk Station, LBC - Leading Britain's Conversation. The following year, LBC achieved three gold medals in the prestigious Radio Centre Awards including 'Station of the Year'.
