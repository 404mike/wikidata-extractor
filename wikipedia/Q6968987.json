He was Bristol's leading miniature portrait painter in the 1820s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Bird", "response": ["At Bristol, Bird became the centre of an informal group which included other artists such as Edward Villiers Rippingille and Nathan Cooper Branwhite, and which developed into the Bristol School. Initially amateur artists dominated the group, and Bird's closest friends included the amateurs John King, who was also Bird's doctor, and George Cumberland. Cumberland, who moved to Bristol in 1807, became godfather to Bird's son. He had a large art collection from which he would lend items for Bird to study."]}, {"page": "1857 in art", "response": ["* March 18 \u2013 Nathan Cooper Branwhite, English miniature portrait painter, watercolourist and engraver (born c.1775)"]}, {"page": "1775 in art", "response": ["**Nathan Cooper Branwhite, English miniature portrait painter, watercolourist and engraver (died 1857)"]}, {"page": "Charles Branwhite", "response": ["Son of Nathan Cooper Branwhite, he was born at Bristol in 1817, and there studied art under his father, beginning as a sculptor. His association and friendship, however, with William James M\u00fcller, also a native of Bristol, induced him to give his undivided attention to water-colour painting, and his pictures, from the year 1849, formed no small attraction in the gallery in Pall Mall East. He adopted this change of art notwithstanding the fact that he had gained silver medals for bas-reliefs in 1837 and 1838 at the Society of Arts. His style of painting shows much of M\u00fcller's influence. Some of his most striking landscapes represent frost scenes. Among his works are: Post Haste, April Showers on the Eastern Coast, An old Lime-kiln, Kilgarren Castle, Winter Sunset, Old Salmon Trap on the Conway, The Environs of an Ancient Garden, 1852, A Frozen Ferry, 1853 (this and the previous picture received prizes from the Glasgow Art Union), Ferry on the Thames (at the 1862 International Exhibition), A Black Frost, Snow Storm, North Wales, Salmon Poaching, and On the River Dee, North Wales."]}, {"page": "Bristol School", "response": ["The school initially formed around Edward Bird some years before his death in 1819. Having arrived in Bristol from Ireland in 1813, Francis Danby was a participant from around 1818\u201319 and remained connected to the group for around a decade, although he left Bristol for London in 1824. Other artists involved were Edward Villiers Rippingille, Samuel Jackson, James Johnson, Nathan Cooper Branwhite, William West, James Baker Pyne, George Arthur Fripp and Paul Falconer Poole.", "William James M\u00fcller's biographer Nathaniel Neal Solly described the sketching meetings as a formal club, but some commentators believe he had confused them with the formation of the Bristol Society of Artists, which held its first exhibition in 1832 at the Bristol Institution. That exhibition included numerous works by Samuel Jackson, James Johnson, Nathan Cooper Branwhite and William James M\u00fcller."]}, {"page": "N. C.
