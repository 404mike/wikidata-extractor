His bestselling novel Falstaff, published in 1976, was described by Michael Ratcliffe (writing in The Times) as \"one of the most ambitious and seductive novels of the decade\", and went on to win both The Hawthornden Prize and Guardian Fiction Prize. The novel was also included in Anthony Burgess's 99 Novels: The Best in English Since 1939 (1984).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Autobiography", "response": ["The term \"fictional autobiography\" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders is an early example. Charles Dickens' David Copperfield is another such classic, and J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., Robert Nye's Memoirs of Lord Byron."]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Robert Nye (1939\u20132016, E)"]}, {"page": "John Falstaff", "response": ["*Falstaff (1976), a novel by Robert Nye."]}, {"page": "March 15", "response": ["*  1939   \u2013 Robert Nye, English author, poet, and playwright (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "Cymbeline", "response": ["Milford Haven is not known to have been used during the period (early 1st century AD) in which Cymbeline is set, and it is not known why Shakespeare used it in the play.

Marisa R. Cull notes its possible symbolism as the landing site of Henry Tudor, when he invaded England via Milford on 7 August 1485 on his way to deposing Richard III and establishing the Tudor dynasty. It may also reflect English anxiety about the loyalty of the Welsh and the possibility of future invasions at Milford."]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Robert Nye (1939\u20132016), English poet, novelist and children's writer"]}, {"page": "Faust", "response": ["* Faust (1980) by Robert Nye "]}, {"page": "1964 in literature", "response": ["*Eric Gregory Award: Robert Nye, Ken Smith, Jean Symons, Ted Walker"]}, {"page": "Merlin (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Merlin, a novel by Robert Nye"]}, {"page": "Anne Hathaway (wife of Shakespeare)", "response": ["The World's Wife, a collection of poems by Carol Ann Duffy, features a sonnet entitled \"Anne Hathaway\", based on the passage from Shakespeare's will regarding his \"second-best bed\".

Anne remembers their lovemaking as a form of \"romance and drama\", unlike the \"prose\" written on the best bed used by guests, \"I hold him in the casket of my widow's head/ as he held me upon that next best bed\". In Robert Nye's novel Mrs Shakespeare: the Complete Works, which purports to be Anne's autobiographical reminiscences, Shakespeare buys the best bed with money given to him by the Earl of Southampton. When Anne comes to London, the couple use the bed for wild sexual adventures, in which they engage in role-playing fantasies based on his plays.
