In 1885 K\u00e4the Windscheid returned to London to study English literature at the University of London, which during the 1870s had become the first in England to accept women for degree courses. In 1887 she emerged from the teacher's training college (Lehrerinnenseminar) in Dresden - at that time the only such institution for women in the whole of Saxony - with a full German teaching qualification. In parallel with her studies she had already, since Easter 1886, been working as a teacher at the prestigious Teichmann'schen Teaching and Education Academy at its daughter school in Leipzig.
