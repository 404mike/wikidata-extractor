He was the second on the goalscoring list in Southern League matches with fourteen, eight behind leading scorer Arthur Turner, as they finished eighth. 1947\u201348 saw them fourth with Curry scoring seventeen but still eight behind Turner. 1948\u201349 saw Colchester again fourth and runners-up in the Southern League Cup with Curry netting another seventeen goals, eleven behind Turner. In 1949\u201350 Colchester finished second on goal average to Merthyr Tydfil and won the Southern League Cup, beating Bath City 6\u20134 on aggregate in the two-legged final. Curry scored twenty league goals, but was third on the list behind Vic Keeble, who had forty, and Fred Cutting with twenty-one. On 3 June 1950 Gillingham, who polled forty-four votes, and Colchester, who polled twenty-eight, were elected to the Football League because of their support base while Merthyr Tydfil only polled one and missed out. In his association with Colchester from 1946 to 1947 to 1949\u201350 Bob Curry had scored 68 goals in 139 appearances in the Southern League, scored eight goals in ten FA Cup ties and 14 goals in 23 Southern League Cup ties, a total of 90 goals in 172 games. In the 1950\u201351 season in which Colchester played in the Football League Third Division South, Colchester's first-ever league game was against old Southern League foes Gillingham at Priestfield on 19 August 1950, when a crowd of 19,542 witnessed a 0\u20130 draw. Five days later Curry scored United's first-ever League goal in a 1\u20131 draw at Swindon Town. He top-scored with 13 goals in 32 games in the league and scored twice in two FA Cup games, as Colchester finished 16th."]}, {"page": "1951\u201352 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Fred Cutting", "|align=\"left\"|Fred Cutting"]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Fred Cutting||IF||||North Walsham||||125||55|| Norwich City||6 December 1947||Free transfer", "|align=\"left\"|Fred Cutting"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["With Gillingham having defeated Merthyr Tydfil during midweek, all Colchester needed to do in their final fixture was to win at Barry Town to secure the title.
