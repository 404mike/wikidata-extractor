Chapman served a prison sentence in 2010 after being found guilty of causing a death by dangerous driving but rejoined Oxford on his release. He was subsequently loaned to Newport County  and Mansfield Town before joining Newport on a permanent basis in 2013. He signed for Mansfield Town on a permanent basis for the 2015\u201316 season, playing for one season before moving into non-league football.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andy Whing", "response": ["In the 2012\u201313 season Whing retained his number 16 shirt. However, he suffered a groin injury that kept him out of the team for the first part of the season. By early October, he had returned to training and returned to the first team on 15 October 2012, coming on as a substitute in the 82nd minute for Tom Craddock, in a 3\u20130 loss against Port Vale. He scored his first goal for Oxford in a 2\u20132 draw at Barnet on 20 November 2012. He subsequently suffered an injury to his knee and ankle during a FA Cup match against Accrington Stanley on 1 December 2012. After making a recovery in early February, he returned to the first team, coming on as a substitute for Adam Chapman in the final minutes of a 3\u20130 loss against Plymouth Argyle on 16 February 2013. His second Oxford goal was an uncharacteristic scissor-kick against Rochdale that left keeper Josh Lillis stunned. Despite being restricted by injury to 22 appearances, Whing signed a contract with the club keeping him until 2016. At the end of the season, Whing was awarded Goal of the Season for his goal against Rochdale."]}, {"page": "Adam Murray", "response": ["The club underwent a rebuild of the squad for the 2015\u201316 season, with 15 new players arriving at the club. These free transfer signings included: goalkeepers Brian Jensen and Scott Shearer; defenders Mal Benning, Lee Collins, Nicky Hunt and Krystian Pearce; midfielders Adam Chapman and Mitch Rose; and forwards Chris Beardsley, Matt Green, Nathan Thomas, Craig Westcarr and Adi Yussuf.
