His position was fly-half and he is the leading Premiership points scorer of all time. \nHodgson also played for England, until announcing his international retirement in 2012.

Against Wales on 2 February 2008, Wilkinson scored 14 points, but England put in a poor display to fall 19\u201326 after squandering a 10-point lead at half-time. Wilkinson then amassed 27 points in England's next two wins against Italy and France.  A disappointing loss against Scotland on 8 March, in which a number of the England squad put in poor performances, raised questions about Wilkinson's inclusion in the starting line-up given the emerging English talents at the number 10 position. 20-year-old Danny Cipriani was the main back up stand-off throughout the tournament (along with Charlie Hodgson), and replaced Wilkinson in the starting line-up for the last match of the tournament against Ireland. This was only the second time in his England career that Wilkinson was dropped to the bench (the first time being for the 1999 Rugby World Cup quarter final match with South Africa for which Paul Grayson was preferred). However, close to the start of the second half during the Ireland match on 15 March, Wilkinson was brought off the bench to replace Toby Flood, thus playing alongside Cipriani at inside centre. This suggests a possible synthesis to the balance of nurturing up-and-coming fly-halves while incorporating the leading player in the position in recent years into the squad."]}, {"page": "Hodgson", "response": ["* Charlie Hodgson (born 1980), rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2005 British & Irish Lions tour to New Zealand", "response": ["|Charlie Hodgson", "Taranaki hosted the Lions at New Plymouth on 8 June. The first half was closely fought in more ways than one, as the Lions' Danny Grewcock and Taranaki's Paul Tito came to blows. The Amber-and-Blacks had a 7\u20136 lead at half-time, but soon after the break Martin Corry scored a try for the Lions. Shortly afterwards, Taranaki's Andrew Hore was sin-binned for holding the ball, and the Lions took control. Consensus man of the match Charlie Hodgson kicked two penalties during Hore's absence, and the Lions kept their momentum even after Hore returned. Shane Horgan added a try and Geordan Murphy two as the Lions won 36\u201314.", "Otago began strongly and the Lions were penalised four times in the first 11 minutes, Otago converting two. The Lions' stronger scrum play brought them back into the game, and the first half was closely fought, ending 13\u201313. The Lions clearly had the momentum, as Will Greenwood scored a try, converted by Charlie Hodgson, just before the break.", "The Lions scored their first convincing tour victory in this game at Palmerston North against NPC second division side Manawatu Turbos, winning 109\u20136. They led 38\u20136 at half time and scored 71 unanswered points in the second. Welshman Shane Williams scored five tries to help the Lions post their all-time record score in New Zealand, surpassing their 64\u20135 victory over Marlborough/Nelson 46 years earlier. In addition to Williams' five, the Lions' tries were scored by Ronan O'Gara (2), Mark Cueto (2), Geordan Murphy, Charlie Hodgson, Jason Robinson, Martin Corry, Neil Back, Gareth Cooper, Gordon D'Arcy and Ollie Smith, with Manawatu restricted to two Jonathan Hargreaves penalties. Lock Donncha O'Callaghan and flanker Martyn Williams were substituted at half-time but had impressed enough to secure Test selection for the following Saturday. Murphy also impressed at full-back, but it was Shane Williams, with elusive running and awareness, who most thrilled Lions supporters."]}, {"page": "Andy Goode", "response": ["Goode made his England d\u00e9but as a replacement for Charlie Hodgson in the 2005 Six Nations victory over Italy, in which he also scored his first points from a conversion."]}, {"page": "Stephen Jones (rugby union)", "response": ["Having been part of the Wales team that won the 2005 Six Nations Championship Grand Slam with Wales, Jones was the in-form fly-half selected for the 2005 British & Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. With four fly-halves in the squad, Jones was involved in just two of the tour matches, starting against the New Zealand M\u0101ori and replacing Jonny Wilkinson against Wellington. For the first Test, both Jones and Wilkinson were selected in the starting line-up ahead of Ronan O'Gara and Charlie Hodgson, with Jones at fly-half and Wilkinson at inside centre; however, Jones lost his place in the team for the second Test, with Wilkinson taking over at fly-half. Having lost both of the first two matches, Sir Clive Woodward restored Jones to the starting line-up for the dead rubber third Test, in which he scored 14 points as the Lions lost 38\u201319. Woodward's decision to select Wilkinson ahead of Jones was questioned by the media, many of whom doubted whether the English fly-half should even have been picked for the tour, having only recently recovered from a serious shoulder injury."]}]}}
