Songs such as Midnight Dean Street, Do It Again and Moonflower brought him to the attention of guitarist Pete Downes who invited him to play with PD3, a jazz group with significant and growing support. He has produced a number of albums and singles and in addition is a regular contributor to Red, a South London rock group.\nHeaven performs the unusual trick of playing guitar left-handed by simply inverting a right-handed guitar. This has led to a distinct tonal style which, coupled with a rare understanding of jazz harmonics, casts him as a guitarist of some significance.\nHe has worked in collaboration with writer Paul Honeyford on a number of occasions to produce songs and jingles under the design umbrella of AR Productions.\nAfter studying at the West London Institute of Higher Education a developed interest in Giotto led him to set up his own design company which counts a number of group album covers in its portfolio.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heaven (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Dave Heaven (born 1959), British musician"]}, {"page": "Quality Communications", "response": ["* Fighting Figurines (1 issue, 1996) \u2014 by Paul Honeyford and Dave Heaven, collecting the story originally anthologized in Revolver"]}, {"page": "West London Institute of Higher Education", "response": ["* Dave Heaven Jazz guitarist"]}, {"page": "Dave heaven", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Heaven "]}, {"page": "Paul Honeyford", "response": ["Paul Honeyford (born Manchester, 1958) is an English biographer and writer who has worked on a number of music- and sport- related works.
