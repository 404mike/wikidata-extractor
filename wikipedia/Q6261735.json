He could trace his musical ancestry in an eminently distinguished line back to the Romantic Era of the 19th century.  He was born in 1920 and was only four years old when he appeared in public for the first time, at London's Wigmore Hall.  His last solo recital at London's Royal Festival Hall was attended by HM The Queen Mother.", "link_mentions": {}}}
