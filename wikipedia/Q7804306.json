In 1998, he started the band Spratleys Japs with his partner Joanne Spratley.Born in Carshalton, Smith formed his first band as a teenager. In 1977, he formed the band Cardiac Arrest, which evolved into Cardiacs in 1981. He was the group's lead writer, and gradually became lead vocalist as previous vocalists Michael Pugh and Mark Cawthra left the band. Smith was characterised for the complexity and wit in his music, writings, drawings, on film and in interviews. In 1985, he wrote the comic Peter and His Dog Spot, a collection of ironic comedy and line drawings. Starting with 1987's \"Big Ship\", his songs were adopted as anthems for the Alphabet Business Concern label.\nFrom 1992 to 1999, Smith produced several records for projects outside of Cardiacs, including The Sea Nymphs' debut album, his first solo LP Tim Smith's Extra Special OceanLandWorld, and the album Pony with Joanne Spratley. After attending a My Bloody Valentine gig in 2008, he suffered a cardiac arrest, leaving him with the condition dystonia and ending activity with Cardiacs. Since then, Smith slowly recovered with help of a JustGiving fundraising campaign and, in 2016, returned with the Sea Nymphs album On the Dry Land. He never fully recovered and died from a heart attack four years after the album's release.\nAs a performer, writer or co-writer, Smith had only one charting single in the UK. Sing to God, his most critically acclaimed album, ranked 53rd for Top Albums of 1996 on Best Ever Albums. In 2018, Smith was honoured with the Doctor of Music degree from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carshalton", "response": ["*Tim Smith, musician, composer and leader of Cardiacs, was born here"]}, {"page": "Chessington", "response": ["* Tim Smith and Jim Smith (respectively singer/guitarist/composer and bass guitarist/backing singer in Cardiacs) grew up in Chessington."]}, {"page": "London Borough of Sutton", "response": ["* Cardiacs, Tim Smith (Cardiacs) musician"]}, {"page": "Napalm Death", "response": ["In April 2014, the band released a cover of the Cardiacs' song \"To Go Off and Things\" via Bandcamp.

Founded by lead singer and guitarist Tim Smith and his brother bassist Jim Smith, the group have cycled through over a dozen keyboardists, percussionists and saxophone players. They are noted for their complex, varied and intense compositional style and for their eccentric, theatrical stage shows. Hailed as an influence by bands as diverse as Blur, Faith No More and Napalm Death, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and post-punk in innovative ways; the band explored music styles ranging from circus music and nursery rhymes to psychedelia and experimental rock. Their music maintains a cult following and continues to influence modern avant-garde metal culture.", "In the late 1970s, Cardiacs established itself playing gigs in Surrey and London over three years from 1977, initially called the Filth and later Cardiac Arrest. They released three demo albums from 1980 to 1984. After creating their label Alphabet Business Concern in 1984, Cardiacs found unexpected mainstream success with \"Is This the Life?\", the re-recorded single from their debut studio album A Little Man and a House and the Whole World Window (1988). Their line-up changed throughout this time, with their best-known lasting through On Land and in the Sea (1989) until Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992) comprising Tim Smith (guitar, lead vocals), Jim Smith (bass guitar, vocals), William D. Drake (keyboards, vocals), Sarah Smith (saxophone, vocals), Dominic Luckman (drums) and Tim Quy (marimba, percussion, synthesiser).", "Sarah left Cardiacs in 1989, though still appeared as a guest artist in later releases, and the band was joined by Christian Hayes, later replaced by Jon Poole. Luckman was replaced by Bob Leith on drums and, as a four-piece comprising T. Smith, J. Smith, Poole and Leith, the band produced the albums Sing to God (1996) and Guns (1999). In 2003, the band performed at The Garage in London with Kavus Torabi replacing Poole on guitar, resulting in the live album The Special Garage Concerts (2005). The last Cardiacs studio album, provisionally titled LSD, was recorded with an expanded line-up and has yet to be released. Keyboardist Colvin Mayers died of an AIDS-related disease in 1993, and Tim Smith died of a heart attack in 2020 after living with the rare neurological disorder dystonia for twelve years following a cardiopulmonary arrest in 2008. Many other members remain musically active.", "Cardiacs are noted for attracting strongly diverse responses: they remained one of Britain's leading cult rock bands during their four-decade-spanning career, but also attracted virulent critical attack (including a lengthy editorial ban from the British music magazine New Musical Express). Tim Smith received the honorary Doctor of Music degree in 2018 from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland for his work in the band, which Jim accepted on his behalf.", "Brothers Jim and Tim Smith grew up in Chessington, Surrey, UK and formed their first musical groups in neighbouring Kingston upon Thames, Greater London.\"Why A Heart Attack Must Not Arrest The Cardiacs\"  \u2013 article by Graham Bendel in The Quietus, 4 May 2010 In 1975, a teenaged Tim was playing guitar in a nameless \"punky-psychedelic\" instrumental band with two of his schoolfriends \u2013 Mark Cawthra (on drums) and David Philpot (on keyboard). The sound of Philpot's Korg synthesizer was to have a strong impact on Smith and the development of the Cardiacs' sound.", "The band which would eventually become Cardiacs began life in 1977. The initial lineup was Michael Pugh on lead vocals, Tim Smith on guitar and backing vocals, and Peter Tagg on drums. The lineup was completed by Jim Smith, who joined on bass guitar and backing vocals. The Smith brothers, Tagg and Pugh played their first live concert in 1978 at The Kaleidoscope in Kingston upon Thames, under the name of the Filth (sometimes incorrectly remembered as Philip Pilf & the Filth). By the time of their second concert (also at The Kaleidecope later in the same year) the band had changed their name to Cardiac Arrest.", "Cardiac Arrest produced a seven-song demo at Elephant Studios in London and subsequently expanded to a sextet, adding Colvin Mayers (keyboards) and Ralph Cade (whose contribution was mainly theatrical, involving manic dancing and posturing with a saxophone). The band honed their craft playing a mixture of pubs, youth clubs, schools, hotels and free festivals. In the early years, the band's line-up was flexible according to availability and circumstances \u2013 for example, Cardiac Arrest played the 1979 Stonehenge Free Festival as a three piece of Tagg, Mayers and Tim Smith (Smith played both guitar and bass while Mayers alternated between guitar and keyboards). A subsequent concert at Surbiton on 6 July 1979 apparently featured \"about eight to ten people on stage\" (including both Peter Tagg and his brother Derek Tagg). ", "The debut Cardiac Arrest release was a 7\" single recorded at Elephant Studios called \"A Bus for a Bus on the Bus\", released in 1979 on Tortch Records. Later in the year both Peter Tagg and Ralph Cade left the band (going on to form the Trudy with Derek Tagg) and the multi-instrumental Mark Cawthra was drafted into Cardiac Arrest to play drums. Michael Pugh also left the band shortly afterwards, and Tim Smith took over lead singer duties as well as guitar playing. By this time Cardiac Arrest operated like a jazz band or football side, keeping various musicians in reserve to cover absences. Many of these people had other roles as part of the technical crew. Future Cardiacs percussionist Tim Quy first performed with the band (as a stand-in bass player) at Snoopies nightclub in Richmond at the start of 1980: this period also saw the arrival of saxophonist Sarah Cutts.", "Later in 1980, Cardiac Arrest released a self-produced cassette album called The Obvious Identity. The album was produced by Tim Smith with the punk/DIY ethic in mind: as he had little cash to invest in the project, it was recorded onto as many old cassette tapes as he could find. An anonymous member of the band has been quoted as commenting that \"the recordings were so shit it wouldn't matter if they were copied onto washing up sponges\". Eventually, 1000 cassettes were recorded, but only sold at concerts to save on expenditure. Shortly afterwards, the band discovered that another band was using the name Cardiac Arrest. After a number of experiments with alternative names (including the Alphabet and the Obvious Identity), they finally decided to rename themselves Cardiacs and played their first concert under that name in April 1981.", "In 1981, Cardiacs self-released the cassette album, Toy World, featuring both new material and recordings dating back to the Cardiac Arrest period. (Consequently, some tracks featured Michael Pugh as lead singer rather than Tim Smith).", "During 1981, Colvin Mayers left the band to join the Sound (a group led by Adrian Borland and with whom Tim had previously collaborated). Sarah Cutts briefly covered live keyboards as well as saxophone, before Mark Cawthra swapped drums for keyboards and Dominic Luckman was recruited from the road crew as the new drummer. At around the same time percussionist Tim Quy became a full-time member (also doubling on bass synthesizer). In July 1983, Tim Smith married Sarah Cutts \u2013 taking his surname, she was henceforward known as Sarah Smith.", "In mid-1983 Mark Cawthra left the band, to be replaced on keyboards by William D. Drake. Tim Smith had previously met Drake in 1982 at the debut performance of Drake's band Honour Our Trumpet (who promptly invited him to join as bass guitarist.) Following Cawthra's departure, Smith returned Drake's favour by inviting him to join Cardiacs. Drake played his first concert with the band on 31 August 1983. Later in the year, Cardiacs added Marguerite Johnston (alto saxophone) and Graham Simmonds (guitar), and for about a year the band worked as an octet. Both Johnston and Simmonds left during the following summer (in July and August respectively), although Simmonds stayed on as Cardiacs' sound engineer.", "At some point in 1983, Tim Smith produced two issues of a comic alternatively called \"Peter and His Dog\" and \"Peter and His Dog Spot\".", "By autumn 1984, the band lineup had settled as the sextet generally referred to as \"the classic line-up\" \u2013 Tim Smith (lead vocals and guitar), Jim Smith (bass and vocals), William D. Drake (keyboards and vocals), Sarah Smith (saxophones and vocals), Tim Quy (percussion and bass synth) and Dominic Luckman (drums).", "In March 1987, a British tabloid newspaper, Sunday Sport, ran a story claiming to be an expos\u00e9 and revealing the supposedly incestuous relationship between Tim and Sarah Smith, in which the couple were portrayed as brother and sister. The headline ran, \"In the bizarre world of music... anything goes \u2013 even incest.\"\"We're Brother and Sister\"  \u2013 article in Sunday Sport 1 March 1987 (archived @ Cardiacs Museum website) (The article ultimately debunked the story by including a corrective quote from Tim Smith's mother). Band manager Mark Walmesley is thought to have started the whole rumour to gain some publicity for the band, predating the superficially similar strategy later employed by the White Stripes twelve years later.", "Over the following two years, the Cardiacs lineup began to disintegrate. Sarah Smith left the band suddenly in April 1989 and was not replaced, removing saxophone from the standard Cardiacs sound. Although Sarah would not rejoin the band, she would retain a long-term connection with Cardiacs by playing on future albums and would very occasionally appear as a special guest for live concerts. Tim Smith brought in a second guitarist \u2013 Christian 'Bic' Hayes, formerly of Ring and the Dave Howard Singers \u2013 and the new two-guitar line-up toured extensively around the UK and Europe for the rest of the year (with Sarah Smith making the first of her special guest appearances at a Brixton Fridge concert on 17 September). During this period, the band also released Archive Cardiacs, a collection of material from the 1976\u201383 period (some of it previously unreleased).", "Cardiacs toured and gigged intermittently during 1990, culminating in a shared concert with Napalm Death at Salisbury Arts Centre on 30 June. The Cardiacs half of the concert was filmed and released as the video Maresnest (produced by Steve Mallet and directed by Steve Payne, and eventually also released as the 1995 live album All that Glitters is a Mares Nest). The band performed as a seven-piece, with Sarah Smith making a one-day return as a band member. Although the concert has achieved legendary status amongst Cardiacs fans, it was problematic for the band. Among other things, Tim Smith's guitar fell apart and keys fell off Sarah Smith's saxophone.", "During 1999\u20132000, Cardiacs began work on a new studio album that remains incomplete and unreleased. Only one song slated for inclusion (\"Faster Than Snakes With a Ball and a Chain\") has ever been released to the public (it appears on the band's 2002 compilation Greatest Hits). Another song, the Jon Poole-penned \"Silvery\", appeared regularly in the band's live repertoire, and was later re-recorded by Jon Poole himself for the God Damn Whores' second album (albeit under the title \"Sparkly Silver Sky\"). While Tim Smith's given explanation for the album's nonappearance was that it had been rendered \"broken\" in some manner, bandmate Kavus Torabi has since stated that, while the band did record around this time, the concept of a \"lost album\" was apocryphal. Cardiacs concerts were rare over the next few years, although the band played the Glastonbury Festival on 23 June 2000 and played two subsequent Whitchurch Festivals on 5 August 2000 and 3 August 2001.", "After several years of limited live activity in front of established fans, Cardiacs made another attempt to recapture their momentum and play to fresh audiences by supporting long-terms fans the Wildhearts for the latter's tour between 8\u201315 December 2004. This tour saw another substitution \u2013 drummer Stephen Gilchrist (Graham Coxon, the Scaramanga Six, Stuffy/The Fuses) stood in for Bob Leith, who had previous tour commitments with art-punk band Blurt. Smith would later perform as a live acoustic trio with Ginger Wildheart and former Cardiac Jon Poole. Around this time a \"Diary\" was begun and updated for the majority of 2005 on the official Cardiacs website, chronicling the band's exploits in typical absurd fashion. Three more annual Astoria gigs passed (the 2005 edition having been professionally shot, currently existing in an unedited state awaiting Tim Smith's involvement until 2007 when Cardiacs released their first new material for eight years: the Ditzy Scene single. Released on Org Records as a limited edition of 1,000 copies, Ditzy Scene was also the first release by the new lineup: on record this included Claire, Melanie, Cathy and Dawn, but the 2007 winter tour featured only Melanie and Cathy, both of whom were now playing percussion and singing.", "=== 2008\u20132020: Indefinite hiatus and death of Tim Smith ===", "==== Tim Smith's heart attack ====", "At the end of June 2008, Tim Smith collapsed from a Cardiopulmonary arrest after leaving a My Bloody Valentine concert.Cardiacs tribute album to raise money for paralysed singer Tim Smith  \u2013 article in The Guardian by Ian Gittins, Thursday 3 February 2011 This led to hypoxic brain damage, leaving Smith severely debilitated by the rare condition dystonia. All Cardiacs-related releases and activity (including a work-in-progress album, provisionally entitled LSD) were immediately shelved until further notice. A year of silence followed during which Smith recuperated in private. In June 2009, a new announcement appeared on the official Cardiacs website, letting readers know that, after a year of rehabilitation, Tim Smith's mind had returned to full functionality and that \"no part of your favourite pop star's intellect or personality has been found to be absent whatsoever.\" It thanked fans for their kind thoughts and made clear Smith's interest in returning to playing music with Cardiacs at such time as his physical rehabilitation allowed. However, it became clear that such rehabilitation would be a long process; and in August 2010, Kavus Torabi stated in an interview podcast that Cardiacs would never play live again.", "Despite the enforced halt in Cardiacs' work as an active band, the group's influence and presence has been sustained by various concerts and campaigns. While most of these have been primarily aimed at raising money for Tim Smith's medical rehabilitation, they have also served both to raise awareness of the band's work and the growing body of musicians influenced by it.", "In December 2010, two tribute CDs, Leader of the Starry Skies: A Tribute To Tim Smith, Songbook 1 and its limited edition companion Leader of the Starry Skies - A Loyal Companion, were compiled by former Cardiac Christian Hayes and former Spratleys Japs singer Jo Spratley. These were released on Kavus Torabi's record label Believers Roast, with all proceeds going directly to the continuing care of Tim Smith. The albums featured cover versions of Smith-penned material (originally for Cardiacs, the Sea Nymphs, Spratleys Japs and Smith's solo album OceanLandWorld) by musicians including the Magic Numbers, Steven Wilson, Oceansize, Robert White/Andy Partridge, Sidi Bou Said and North Sea Radio Orchestra as well as former Cardiacs including Hayes himself (as Mikrokosmos), Torabi (as Knifeworld), William D. Drake, Mark Cawthra and Peter Tagg (with the Trudy).", "In 2013, after a long period of radio silence, the official Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale.

They featured Cardiacs-related groups in performance such as Knifeworld, William D. Drake, and Redbus Noface. Several smaller benefit concerts were held from time to time in this period and moving forward.", "Later the same year, teaser images began appearing on Cardiacs' website and Facebook group, culminating in the announcement of the long-awaited next Sea Nymphs album, On the Dry Land, whose songs had been recorded around the same time as the first album but were left unreleased for over 20 years. The album was released in November 2016 in CD and vinyl formats. The completion of on the Dry Land was made possible thanks to a turn for the better in Tim Smith's health; he was able to return to the studio to supervise production and additional recording necessary to the album's completion between 2015-2016. In an interview with Uncut, Smith revealed that even more Sea Nymphs material beyond on the Dry Land will be released at some point. He also stated that he was \"deeply touched\" by the efforts of those who had contributed toward the Cardiacs tribute album, Leader of the Starry Skies (the sales of which went directly toward rehabilitating Smith) and that he had since \"made a pledge to [him]self to get better\".", "In November 2016, Jo Spratley gathered several musicians of Cardiacs-influenced origins and \"reformed\" her and Tim Smith's band, Spratleys Japs (albeit without Tim due to his health, although Smith did attend as an audience member), for a one night show in which the band performed the entirety of the Japs' sole album, Pony, as well as the remaining tracks from the Hazel EP (and ended the set with Cardiacs' own \"Flap Off You Beak\"). A second show was announced shortly afterward for January 2017, as a double billing with Kavus Torabi's band Guapo.", "-Tim Smith", "In January 2018, almost ten years since Tim Smith's cardiac arrest, an interview and full explanation of his condition were published in multiple major news publications as well as the official Cardiacs website. A donation campaign was simultaneously launched, its goal being to facilitate improved care for Tim with the hope that the proper neurological treatment it would fund would help him regain control of his body, as he had responded positively to similar, but minimal and inconsistent treatment in the past. The initial donation goal of 40,000 GBP was breached in less than 24 hours, and a new goal of 100,000 GBP was instated, which would fund treatment for one year.", "==== Death of Tim Smith ====", "Following twelve years of living with dystonia, Tim Smith died on 21 July 2020, with his death announced the following day.", "The broad combination of styles in the band's music has sometimes been referred to as \"progressive punk\" \u2013 or \"pronk\" \u2013 and has led to Cardiacs being labelled the primary exponents of this musical style. Tim Smith rejected the term, preferring the description \"psychedelic\" or simply \"pop\". Musicians that the band have cited as influences include XTC, Van der Graaf Generator, Gong, early Split Enz, Devo, Gentle Giant, Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias, early Genesis, Deaf School and Wire. The Who's Quadrophenia was particularly influential on Smith's approach to songwriting, having taught how to write musical notation from the album's songbook.  Smith once stated, \"I don't know what influences us really, I wouldn't say that we are influenced by any actual bands in particular\". Tim Smith denied that Gentle Giant was an influence on the band, but Sarah Smith says that they were.", "Earlier lineups of the band were sextets and octets employing extensive use of saxophones, percussion and live keyboards. From 1991 onwards, the band was a rock power quartet centred on two guitars (with the remaining keyboard and percussion parts sequenced on tape). Vocally, Cardiacs employed a distinctive singing style centred on Tim Smith's lead vocals (reedy and high-pitched, with a strong, punk-styled south London suburban accent) and choral sections (varying from yelled to falsetto) involving most or all of the band. Smith's singing style has been described by music critics as 'skittish'; it has also been commented that his singing voice sounded very similar to his speaking one. The band's music was written almost entirely by Tim Smith, although contributions were sometimes made by other group members.", "In performance, Cardiacs generally rejected (or occasionally parodied) standard rock band posturing. The band's shows instead featured behaviour which has been described as \"therapeutic, surrealist pantomime\", compared to absurdist theatre, and labelled \"not so much theatrically eccentric as completely fucking neurotic\". During any given performance Tim Smith ranted between and during numbers, acting out bizarre childlike ideas and emotions.January 1988 live review of Cardiacs at The Marquee Club, London, UK  by Cathi Unsworth in Sounds (copy of text hosted on Cardiacs homepage)March 1988 live review of Cardiacs at Town and Country Club, London, UK  by Jane Solanas in New Musical Express (copy of text hosted on Cardiacs homepage)December 1988 live review of Cardiacs at Town and Country Club, London, UK  by Andrew Smith in Melody Maker (copy of text hosted on Cardiacs homepage) During the 1980s the band perfected a detailed stage act involving shabby lift attendant costumes, badly-applied clown make-up, Tim Smith's bullying of other band members (predominantly Jim Smith), and a final formal presentation of champagne and flowers by the Consultant and Miss Swift complete with confetti, taking place to \"a euphoric sweep of saxophone and keyboards that wouldn't seem out of place in a '70s cigar advert.\"1987 live review of Cardiacs at Dingwalls, London, UK  by Andy Hurt in Sounds (copy of text hosted on Cardiacs homepage) During the 1990s, the theatrical elements of the live show were toned down and the uniforms replaced by formal suits, although certain rituals (including the childlike mannerisms and Smith's ranting style) were retained.December 1988 live review of Cardiacs at Town and Country Club, London, UK  by Stephen Dalton in New Musical Express (copy of text hosted on Cardiacs homepage)", "While the critical status of Cardiacs is wildly mixed (the band tends to attract extreme responses with some critics hailing them while others violently condemn them to the point of pariahhood), Cardiacs were renowned for their unique performing and songwriting styles and their poetically cryptic, philosophical and abstract lyrics, as well as for their ability to produce a unique, complex and innovative sound with all their musical ventures over and over again throughout their long career. Tim Smith regularly attracted fulsome praise: he has been described in the music press as the \"Mozart\", \"Beethoven\" and \"Messiaen\" of rock and pop music for his complex and innovative compositional skills, as well as being hailed as a genius (albeit sometimes a \"deranged\" one). The snooker player Steve Davis is also a big fan of the band and attended many of their live gigs.", "Cardiacs have had a profound underground influence on over three decades of musicians, including the pioneers of the nu metal and avant-garde metal genres. The band has also influenced math rock artists such as the Monsoon Bassoon and Battles. The band are sometimes credited as having been the inventors of the \"pronk\" (progressive punk) music genre; Tim Smith rejected the term from the off, stating that Cardiacs are better described as a pop group or a psychedelic rock band.", "Musicians who have cited Tim Smith's work as a major influence include Mike Vennart of Oceansize, Mike Patton of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, and Tool.

Their first album with drummer Bob Leith and their second as a four-piece, it was recorded throughout 1995, breaking a hiatus by the band that had lasted since the band's previous album Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992). During writing and recording, Jon Poole took a greater role than before, contributing to many songs written by band leader Tim Smith, and writing some of his own. The band decided to create a double album to encompass the great wealth of material written after their previous album. As with the band's previous albums, it presents a unique sound, and is seen as more eclectic than the band's previous albums, with one reviewer describing the record as \"essentially [taking] everything Cardiacs had always been and [ramping] it up to maximum,\" and another saying the album was where \"Smith's ability to express the music inside his head really began to transcend any sort of identifiable genre and turned Cardiacs into something truly unique.\"", "Following its release, their drummer Dominic Luckman left the band and was replaced by Bob \"Babba\" Leith, and the band subsequently became their second \"classic\" line-up, sometimes referred to as \"Cardiacs Mark II\".

Due to the sheer amount of material that group leader Tim Smith had written over a number of years with little or no Cardiacs live performances, they decided the new album would be a double album.", "The album sessions presented a change in Cardiacs' working methods. Whereas most previous material had been written and arranged by band leader Tim Smith, Sing to God features extensive contributions from Jon Poole, who played a strong role in orchestrating Smith's basic material with detailed riffs and keyboard parts and contributed several songs entirely written by himself, whilst drummer Bob Leith also made significant contributions to the album's lyrics, marking the first time that Smith was not the only songwriter for the band. In a 1996 interview, Smith said \"I really like the stuff [Poole]'s written, we all do. We're really dead lucky to have someone like him. He's written some great stuff for the new album.\" Poole recalled that \"this was a joyous and creative time and easily the best time I had in the band which is strange as I was going through upheaval in my personal life and had to keep walking off into the fields to have a good old blub but maybe this added to it all! We took the studio to Jim and Jane's place in the country. When I arrived there Jim and Jane were adding snipping sounds with garden tools to 'Wireless'. To this day I think it's one of Jane's proudest moments and I love hearing her tell other people about how surreal it was.\"", "During recording there, Tim Smith would create drums and rough keyboard chords on tape and would ask Poole to come up with guitar and bass riffs.  Poole recalled \"I was literally allowed to do pretty much anything I wanted.\"  Tim would then \"do the production bit\" and \"get the best out of\" Poole.  The two sometimes contributed to the writing of each other's tracks, including Smith contributing the string arrangement to Poole's \"Manhoo\". During this phase of recording, Jim and Jane invited all the band's friends over \"every so often for parties that have now gone down in history as being nothing short of legendary.\"  In 2009, Poole recalled that \"I still can't listen to Mr Bungle or Mercury Rev without having disturbing flashbacks! It was a wonderful time and something that I'm so lucky to have been a part of. Tim would no doubt echo that.\"", "Sing to God presents a unique sound that critics found hard to classify, and is seen as \"a record that is scarcely comparable to anything else by anyone else.\" A journalist from PIEmag said the album was \"more original and dynamic than ever before; they mix their classic Cardiacesque, huge orchestral harmonies with delicate pop, fast rocking and furious, at times almost Naked City-ish jazz structures. To add yet another dimension to their music, they experiment with sound and production in a way we haven't heard since the heyday of Psychic TV, or even the old 'kraut' bands like Faust, Neu!, Can etc..\" Benjamin Bland of Drowned in Sound said that \"somewhat approximate to the notion of Cardiacs squared, Sing to God essentially takes everything Cardiacs had always been and ramps it up to maximum.\" He noted that \"this is a record drenched in deranged pomposity, from the massive riffs to the expansive keyboards and theatrical vocals. That's without even mentioning the bits that sound something like Sgt Pepper being performed by a Frank Zappa conducted London Symphony Orchestra on speed.\" Sean Kitching of The Quietus said the album is \"the pinnacle of Tim Smith's studio mastery and exhibits elements of the gentler side of his Sea Nymphs project alongside the full-on helter skelter, breakneck velocity more usually associated with the band. It is also, despite the richness of its orchestration and more experimental tendencies, decidedly a pop record\u2013one as quintessentially English sounding as Pink Floyd's seminal Piper at the Gates of Dawn or XTC's classic English Settlement.\" He also commented that the album marked the point where \"Smith's ability to express the music inside his head really began to transcend any sort of identifiable genre and turned Cardiacs into something truly unique.\" Philip Whitehead of Sputnikmusic said \"there is a wide range of styles on display here with the album spinning off in all sorts of directions at unexpected times but it's never 'too much' for the listener, with the softer tracks coming in at perfect times to provide a break after the chaos of Tim Smith let loose, and the closers on each disc do their part perfectly to end proceedings.\"", "The album also features material originally written for various other Cardiacs related projects. The track \"Nurses Whispering Verses\" had been recorded twice before, once on the band's 1981 cassette album Toy World and once on the original cassette release of the band's 1983 album The Seaside (it was removed from the 1995 CD reissue, but reinstated on the 2015 CD and Vinyl reissue in remastered form). \"Bell Stinks\", \"Bell Clinks\" and \"Angleworm Angel\", all written by Poole, were all taken from the repertoire of the thrash band Panixsphere, which featured Tim Smith and Jon Poole alongside Christian Hayes and David Francolini of Levitation. \"Billion\" is allegedly the first song which Tim Smith ever wrote, resurrected and recorded many years after its composition, whilst \"Wireless\" features Tim Smith reading from a children's story called \"Peril on the Sea\" written by Dawn Staple, who would join the band in 2004 as a percussionist and backing singer.Sing to God liner notes. Sam Shepherd opined that \"if you were to take a guess at what Smith was suggesting with this album it would simply be that the world is a magical, wondrous place, and that it is still possible to see it through a child's eyes. To that end, any religious themes that can be detected are swamped in childlike word play or muted understanding. Creation is covered in the beautifully grotesque \"Insect Hooves on Lassie\", which finds Tim indulging in a little re-designing and making his own kind of hero. dog.\"", "\"Bellyeye\" and \"Manhoo\" have both been compared to Blur, a band influenced by Cardiacs. The latter, written by Poole, \"has a skip in its step and a rumbling and forceful bassline that somehow couldn't be poppier if it was covered in glitter,\" and features a string arrangement written by Tim Smith. \"Wireless\" was described as one of the \"most beautiful\" tracks on the album, is Smith's re-imagining of Faust's song \"Psalter\", also known as 'Lauft... Heisst Das es Lauft Oder es Kommt Bald... Lauft', but performed primarily on piano and scissor-wielding percussive ensemble that ends with Smith reading a \"bizarre aquatic-themed children's story.\" Jim and Jane Smith added snipping sounds with garden tools to the song. \"Dirty Boy\", which opens the second disc, is \"perhaps the album's crowning achievement\" according to Kitching, beginning with a guitar riff and alchemically transmuting that song over the course of its nearly nine minutes duration with \"celestially ringing sounds\" constructed by \"innumerably overlaid strata of acoustic guitar and incredibly drawn out sustained vocals that when performed live had an undeniably consciousness-altering effect on all those present.\" \"Quiet as a Mouse\", described as a \"weird piece\", was described by Tim Smith as the sound of \"just somebody who left the tape running when we were doing these orchestral bits.\" The band came across it \"kind of accidentally\" and enjoyed it enough to include it on the album. \"Odd Even\" is \"an airy dip into baroque pop incorporating lush string arrangements.\"", "Tim Smith denied that the album title, Sing to God, was a reference to faith. He said that the album was named it \"merely because [former Cardiacs keyboardist] Bill Drake had this little kid-hymn book and it was called Sing to God and we thought it was a nice title.\" He said that \"it's just if the word \"Jesus\" appears [in the album's lyrics], it's just because it mentions Jesus in the same way that anyone's name would appear.\" The album cover, featuring the band's disembodied heads floating against a dark night sky dotted with stars, was inspired by Night of the Hunter. Sean Kitching of The Quietus said that \"the creepy fairytale atmosphere\" of the film \"makes it an entirely appropriate image that resonates perfectly with the album's overall vibe. The fact that the band members' eyes are all rendered artificially larger, suggesting wide-eyed children, or perhaps adults returned to that beatific state by the administration of some pharmaceutical philtre, also attests to the truly psychedelic nature of the sounds contained within.\"", "The album was released in the UK on 11 June 1996 by the band's long-running own label Alphabet Business Concern, alongside re-releases of all their previous albums. Originally a limited edition 2CD double album set, limited to 3,000 copies, Sing to God was subsequently re-released as two separate albums, Sing to God \u2013 Part One and Sing to God \u2013 Part Two. The band's website explained this, saying the album \"was later split into two separate albums due to a mistake\". \"Bellyeye\" was released as the album's first single several months ahead of the album on Org Records, the record-releasing wing of long-term Cardiacs' supporters Organ Magazine. It was one of the band's few releases on a label other than Alphabet Business Concern. Tim Smith said the single was \"only a small release made by some friends who run a fanzine over here. Since we hadn't released anything for a couple of years they offered to put that out for us. That was a part of the new album that we were recording at the time anyway.\" A comment about not disturbing commercial sensibilities was slightly edited in the \"Manhoo\" single because \"it was too long and when it's too long it won't be played on the radio.\" The part in question was \"that middle bit where it goes off the wall a little bit, it comes off the rail and then lands back where it was in the first place. [The band] thought [they'd] just keep it on the rail. [Tim Smith] likes both versions.\" Two further singles were released from the album, \"Manhoo\" and \"Odd Even\", both released like the album on the band's own Alphabet Business Concern label. Additional singles for \u201cBell Clinks\u201d and \u201cDirty Boy\u201d were planned but never released. None of the singles charted.", "The album was an instant hit with fans, but due to the ongoing neglect and disdain of the band by the British music press, one of the only original reviews was an infamous review in Vox, who rated the album a score of 0/10. When asked by upon release by PIE Mag how the album had been received by fans and the media, Tim Smith replied \"oh, the media? No, we don't get received at all in the media over here. We did a couple of live radio sessions on Radio 1 over here. Luckily we've got this DJ, Mark Radcliffe, who's on our side, which is nice. I reckon he must be the only person in the media that sticks his neck out for us. I think we've seen  review of it so far and it got nought out of ten.\" When asked about the media's treatment of the band, Smith said \"you can't rock the boat in this country! It's really not allowed to play anything that might go against the grain of the current fashion. I think it's because we've been around for a long time and we refuse to go away. We really, genuinely do love what we do and there's a bunch of people over here who like it enough to make us carry on. But you know, British media... I mean, every other country in the world know about the British media and how thick they are. We're just a prime target for their dartboard. The fact that we're not good looking, the fact that we're probably getting on a bit now, that kind of thing.\" One British journalist in a later review of Sing to God said that \"such negative feelings [about the band] must be discouraged, given the joys contained within their kaleidoscopic world.\"", "Sean Kitching of The Quietus said \"this is a wonderful album for those whose hearts lack the cynicism to ridicule its often delirious flights of fancy, a cornucopia of synaesthetically rendered technicolor delights for those who have not yet lost the innocence required to be receptive its psychedelic splendour.\" Michael Rodham-Heaps of Freq.org.uk called it \"an absolute joy from start to finish\". Alex Wisgard of The Line of Best Fit gave the album a score of 8.5/10, saying \"no one was writing music like this in the Nineties \u2013 okay, Mansun came close with Six, but they never made a career out of songs like that, did they? And you can't imagine Cardiacs ever having an \"I Can Only Disappoint U\" moment - and I doubt anyone has really ever tried since. With Tim Smith still recovering from a life-threatening heart-attack-and-stroke combination which befell him in 2008, sadly the man himself is in no position either. But with their work slowly coming back into circulation, now is as good a time as any to try and unravel their mystery before anyone else catches up.\"", "When asked in a 2001 interview with Margen Magazine, whether he thinks Sing to God is the band's best album due to it being their \"more known album\", Tim Smith replied \"no\u2026 I sort of like them all in one way or another.\" The band followed Sing to God with Guns (1999), their final album, which shocked fans due to its less restless sound.

I sat there for 36 hours solid and didn\u2019t stop until it sort of brought itself to its end and when I looked back at it I wondered where the fuck it had come from because I couldn\u2019t remember doing it.\"", "All songs written by Tim Smith.

The group, whose studio line-up comprised Tim Smith, Sarah Smith (surname changed from Cutts and later to Jones) and William D. Drake, are commonly regarded as the quieter side to the parent band Cardiacs. The members were integral to the 1980s sound of the band and their music's recognition in punk and goth circles. Rooted in folk and chamber music, their sound is much lighter than that of their parent outfit. The songs dispense with the use of loud guitars and drums, in favour of differing vocal rhythms, keyboards and brass instruments. However, the music still contains Cardiacs' trademark off-the-wall chord progressions and sudden time changes, albeit in a slightly gentler fashion.", "By 1991, the Sea Nymphs had named their group after reuniting. They soon made their single debut with \"Appealing to Venus\" (1991). From 1992 onwards, they produced records of a different musical style, including the albums The Sea Nymphs (originally called \"Tree Tops High\", 1992) and On the Dry Land (2016). In 1984, they signed with the newly created Alphabet Business Concern, a record label that continues to oversee projects related to Cardiacs' legacy. All members have released material as solo artists. Tim Smith suffered a cardiac arrest in 2008, limiting his mobility and temporarily causing the group to go on hiatus before returning to the studio in 2015. Smith died of a heart attack in 2020. Drake remains musically active, whilst Jones pursues a career in painting and sculpture.", "A second album, On the Dry Land, was recorded around the same time as their debut in the 1990s but remained unreleased until November 2016. Several rough tracks, some bearing different titles, had floated around file sharing spheres in the years leading up to release. Having recovered sufficiently enough from his 2008 heart attack and stroke, Tim Smith was able to return to his studio to complete the album between 2015-2016. In an interview, Smith revealed further unreleased Sea Nymphs material is set to see the light of day following On the Dry Land's completion. Smith also stated he was \"deeply touched\" at the efforts made to help him recover from his accident (such as the release of the Cardiacs tribute album, Leader of the Starry Skies, in which all sales of the album directly funded Smith's rehabilitation), and had made a \"pledge to [him]self to get better\"."]}, {"page": "All That Glitters Is a Mares Nest", "response": ["All songs written by Tim Smith unless otherwise indicated.", "* Tim Smith - guitar, lead vocals"]}]}}
