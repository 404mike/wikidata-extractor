He was Director General of MI5 from 1956 to 1965.\nSome commentators, including the journalist Chapman Pincher and intelligence officer Peter Wright, have suggested that Hollis was a Soviet agent. In his book The Defence of the Realm: The Authorised History of MI5 (2009), the Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew rejects this theory.\nThe government's official position, first stated by Margaret Thatcher, is that there was no evidence that Hollis might have been a traitor.", "link_mentions": {}}}
