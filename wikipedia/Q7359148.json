He later moved to France and then to Herefordshire.\nWindsor was accused of damaging the image of the union by visiting Libya during the strike and meeting Colonel Gaddafi, at the time an enemy of the United Kingdom.  Windsor was despatched to Libya by NUM president Arthur Scargill, possibly in an attempt to put NUM funds beyond the reach of the government. Both Mick McGahey, vice president of the NUM, and Peter Heathfield, general secretary, denied knowing about this trip before it was revealed in the press. For reasons still not clear, Windsor met Colonel Gadaffi and film of the two men embracing was shown on British TV. The Sunday Times' report on his visit was credited by some with substantially undermining public and parliamentary support for the miners.\nIn 1990, Windsor was involved in media reports concerning Arthur Scargill's misuse of union funds and receipt of funds from Libya, allegations which were substantially based on Windsor's evidence. The story was initially reported on the front page of the Daily Mirror and in the Central TV programme The Cook Report. Gavin Lightman QC was requested to undertake an enquiry into the manner in which NUM funds and the \u00a31 million donation by Russian miners were used during and after the miners' strike and found that Scargill had failed to account properly for substantial amounts of money including bank accounts opened in the name of Scargill's mother and Nell Myers (Scargill's PA). The report also found that Windsor had not repaid the \u00a329,500 that he had admitted taking from the Miners' Solidarity Fund.Then Mirror editor Roy Greenslade later wrote an article apologising to Scargill for the false claim that he had used Libyan money to pay off his mortgage and for relying on Windsor as a source, given that Windsor had still not repaid the \u00a329,500 as of 2002, when the Court of Cassation in France had ordered that he repay the money.Some of his actions during and after the strike led to accusations that he was an agent of MI5. The allegations were raised in Parliament, but could not be challenged outside it due to parliamentary privilege. After the allegation was repeated in a 21 May 2000 newspaper article in the Sunday Express by Rupert Allason, Windsor in 2003 won a libel action against the Express and its then editor, Rosie Boycott. The head of the MI5 branch responsible for 'monitoring' unions and strike activity at the time of the strike, Dame Stella Rimington, gave an unusual denial in 2001, saying that Windsor was \"never an agent in any sense of the word that you can possibly imagine\", and, in breach of normal government protocol, John Major, the Prime Minister, made an official statement that Roger Windsor was never involved with the government.\nWindsor was portrayed as Terry Winters in David Peace's novel GB84.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)", "response": ["The Director-General of MI5 from 1992 to 1996, Dame Stella Rimington, revealed in her autobiography in 2001 that MI5 'counter-subversion' exercises against the NUM and striking miners included tapping union leaders' phones. She denied the agency had informers in the NUM, specifically denying its chief executive Roger Windsor had been an agent.", "Media reports alleged that senior NUM officials were personally keeping some of the funds. In November 1984, it was alleged that senior NUM officials had travelled to Libya for money. Cash from the Libyan government was particularly damaging coming seven months after the murder of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London by Libyan agents. In 1990, the Daily Mirror and TV programme The Cook Report claimed that Scargill and the NUM had received money from the Libyan government. The allegations were based on allegations by Roger Windsor, who was the NUM official who had spoken to Libyan officials. Roy Greenslade, the editor of the Mirror, said 18 years later he was \"now convinced that Scargill didn't misuse strike funds and that the union didn't get money from Libya.\" This was long after an investigation by Seumas Milne described the allegations as wholly without substance and a \"classic smear campaign\"."]}, {"page": "Roger windsor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roger Windsor "]}, {"page": "Arthur Scargill", "response": ["In 1990, Scargill was accused in a series of Daily Mirror articles of mishandling money donated for the striking miners during the 1984\u20131985 strike, with many of the sources being those who had previously worked with him in the NUM such as Kim Howells, Jim Parker and Roger Windsor.  It was alleged that, of the money donated from Libya, Scargill took \u00a329,000 for his own bridging loan and \u00a325,000 for his home in Yorkshire, but gave only \u00a310,000 to the striking Nottinghamshire miners. In addition, it was alleged that he had taken \u00a31,000,000 of cash donated by the Soviet Union for the Welsh miners and placed it in a Dublin bank account for the \"International Miners' Organisation\", where it stayed until a year after the strike had finished. There was much criticism of Scargill within the NUM from the Welsh and Scottish areas, who briefly considered splitting from the NUM. An internal NUM report by Gavin Lightman QC found that Scargill had used some of the Libyan money to pay for improvements to his bungalow but not to pay off his mortgage (as had been alleged), and stated that Scargill's failure to make a full report on the Soviet money donated for the Welsh miners was \"a remarkable breach of duty\" and that he should repay the money back to the NUM. Scargill accepted Lightman's statement that many of his actions suffered from a lack of professional advice, which he was unwilling to be bound by.", "Film director Ken Loach subsequently made \"The Arthur Legend\" as part of Channel 4's Dispatches series. The documentary suggests that the claims against Scargill were untrue. The editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Roy Greenslade, wrote an article in The Guardian in May 2002 to apologise to Scargill for the false claims about paying off the mortgage and for putting too much trust in Roger Windsor, who at the time had still not repaid the \u00a329,500 that he had taken from the Miners' Welfare Fund and that the Lightman Report had asked that he repay."]}, {"page": "GB84", "response": ["The novel is largely based on factual events and follows two main characters: Terry Winters (based on Roger Windsor),Red Pepper, http://www.redpepper.org.uk/No-redemption/ chief executive of the National Union of Mineworkers; and Stephen Sweet (based on David Hart), an advisor to the Thatcher government."]}, {"page": "Windsor (surname)", "response": ["*Roger Windsor, British labour union leader and former chief executive of the National Union of Mineworkers"]}]}}
