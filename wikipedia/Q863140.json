Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim that the city was \"the centre of consciousness of the human universe\".

This trend threatened the Brill Building writers and other professional songwriters that dominated the American music industry.

Lennon and McCartney also supplied hit songs for several other artists up to 1966, including Cilla Black, Billy J.
