He also served in the Second World War as commander of the newly formed Force H: after the French armistice with Germany, Winston Churchill gave Somerville and Force H the task of neutralizing the main element of the French battle fleet, then at Mers El K\u00e9bir in Algeria. After he had destroyed the French Battle fleet, Somerville played an important role in the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship Bismarck.\nSomerville later became Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet. In April 1942 Admiral Ch\u016bichi Nagumo's powerful Indian Ocean raid inflicted heavy losses on his fleet.  However, in spring 1944, with reinforcements, Somerville was able to go on the offensive in a series of aggressive air strikes in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies.
