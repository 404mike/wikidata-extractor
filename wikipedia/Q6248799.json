He was ordained and inducted to Castlemilk East Parish Church, Glasgow in 1971 - his only charge.Known locally as - respectfully - Mr Miller, in 2004 the Reverend realised that many people in the local area were suffering with the loss of a loved-one due to accidents, violence and social problems; he therefore began The Lost Lives Project. http://www.localnewsglasgow.co.uk/tag/rev-john-miller/ The Lost Lives Project is aimed at channeling this loss and bringing together people of the community who, previously, suffered behind closed doors.\nHe retired from his parish duties in July 2007, but in retirement went to work temporarily for the Church in Zimbabwe.His unassuming dedication to serving the people of Castlemilk was recognised by the Church of Scotland in his election as Moderator of the General Assembly in 2001. Miller Primary School in Castlemilk was named after him and his wife, Mary Miller.The General Assembly over which he moderated was uniquely held in the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. This was to allow the Scottish Parliament to meet in the Church's Assembly Hall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Miller", "response": ["John Miller may refer to:", "*John Miller (North Dakota politician) (1843\u20131908), Governor of North Dakota, 1889\u20131891", "*John Miller (Missouri politician) (1781\u20131846), Governor of Missouri, 1826\u20131832; U.S. Representative from Missouri, 1837\u20131843", "*John Miller (Washington politician) (1938\u20132017), U.S. Representative from Washington", "*John Miller (New York politician) (1774\u20131862), U.S. representative from New York", "*John Miller (Virginia politician) (1947\u20132016), State Senator from Virginia", "*John Miller (police official) (born 1958/9), New York Police Department official, former FBI official and former television host", "*John Miller (pseudonym), a pseudonym used by Donald Trump", "*John Miller (engineer) (1805\u20131883), MP for Edinburgh 1868\u20131874", "*Sir John Miller, 2nd Baronet (1665\u20131721), MP for Chichester 1698\u20131700, 1701\u20131705 and 1710\u20131713 and Sussex 1701", "*Sir John Miller, 3rd Baronet (1867\u20131918), Justice of the Peace and magistrate for Kent, 1889", "*John Miller (New South Wales politician) (1870\u20131934), New South Wales state MP", "*John Miller (South Australian politician) (1840\u20131919), member of the South Australian House of Assembly", "*John Miller (1865 Medal of Honor recipient) (1839\u20131882), Medal of Honor recipient", "*Sir John Miller (equerry) (1919\u20132006), British Lieutenant-Colonel and Crown Equerry", "*John Miller (American artist) (born 1954), American visual artist, writer and musician based in New York and Berlin", "*John Miller (Cornish artist) (1931\u20132002), English artist specializing in beach scenes", "*John Miller (botanical illustrator) (1715\u2013c. 1792), German engraver, painter, and botanist", "*John Miller (film producer), American film producer", "*John Miller (musician) (born 1945), Broadway music coordinator and actor", "*John Miller Jr. (born 1942), American bassoonist, principal of the Minnesota Orchestra", "*John Miller, a pseudonym of H.
