When in November 1922 the archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun with its contents largely intact, the Egyptian authorities agreed to loan Lucas to the excavation. He commenced work in December 1922, a part of a small team of experienced archaeologists and experts, led by Howard Carter and including Arthur Mace, Arthur Callender and photographer Harry Burton. Lucas played a key role in this team, being responsible for the conservation, restoration and preparation for shipping of the thousands of objects found, some of them quite fragile. To enable him to undertake this work, a makeshift laboratory was set up in the nearby empty tomb of Seti II, with Lucas, assisted by Arthur Mace, assessing, cleaning and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 repairing each object to ensure safe transport to the Cairo Museum.
