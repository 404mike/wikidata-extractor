With the increasing mapping of the divisions of plants at the beginning of the 20th century, the search began for the ancestor of the vascular plants.

Trenches were cut into the chert at the end of this period, and Robert Kidston and William Henry Lang worked furiously to describe the plant fossils between 1917 and 1921. The arthropods were examined soon afterwards by different workers. Interest in the chert then waned until the field was reinvigorated by Alexander Geoffrey Lyon in the late 1950s, and new material was collected by further trenching from 1963 to 1971. Since 1980, the chert has been examined by the University of M\u00fcnster, and from 1987 by Aberdeen University, whose researchers confirmed that the chert was indeed produced in a hot spring setting."]}, {"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*1956: William Henry Lang"]}, {"page": "Cooksonia", "response": ["The first Cooksonia species were described by William Henry Lang in 1937 and named in honor of Isabel Cookson, with whom he had collaborated and who collected specimens of Cooksonia pertoni in Perton Quarry, Wales, in 1934. There were originally two species, Cooksonia pertoni and C. hemisphaerica. The genus was defined as having narrow leafless stems (axes), which branched dichotomously, with terminal sporangia that were \"short and wide\". There was a central vascular cylinder consisting of annular tracheids (water-conducting cells with thickened walls). Six other species were later added to the genus: C. crassiparietilis, C. caledonica, C. cambrensis, C. bohemica, C. paranensis and C. banksii. A review in 2010 concluded that the delineation of the genus was inaccurate and that some species needed to be removed; in particular those in which sporangia were not more-or-less trumpet-shaped.
