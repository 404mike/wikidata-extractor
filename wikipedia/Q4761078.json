Despite Partick defender Martin Clark catching the ball and handing it to goalkeeper Andy Murdoch to restart, Mottram missed both the goal and handball to wave play on. Connolly scored twice in the match in a 4\u20130 win. Mottram went on to officiate in the 1994 World Cup the following year. The incident resulted in the stanchions from which the ball had rebounded, previously widely used, being removed in a re-design of football goalposts. In 2018, at the same end of the stadium, a similar incident occurred, with Partick Thistle this time being denied a legitimate goal."]}, {"page": "Andrew Murdoch", "response": ["* Andy Murdoch (footballer, born 1968), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle)", "* Andy Murdoch (footballer, born 1995), Scottish footballer (Rangers FC)"]}, {"page": "Andy Murdoch (footballer, born 1970)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Murdoch (footballer, born 1968)"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Celtic F.C. season", "response": ["|Andy Murdoch"]}]}}
