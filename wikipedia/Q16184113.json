After serving a three match suspension, Basham returned to the first team, on 18 October 2016, making his first start from suspension, in a 3\u20130 win against Shrewsbury Town, followed up by scoring in the next game, in a 3\u20133 draw against Bradford City. Two weeks later, on 6 November 2016, Basham scored and set up one of the goals, in a 6\u20130 win over Leyton Orient in the first round of the FA Cup. Due to his impressive performance at the club, Manager Wilder hinted that Basham could be earning a new contract, with a year to his contract left. As the 2016\u201317 season progressed, Basham began to play in the defense, as a centre-back, partnering with either Jack O'Connell, Ethan Ebanks-Landell and Jake Wright. Around the same time, Basham played in the midfield position, with Paul Coutts. Then, in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale on 14 April 2017, Basham produced an impressive display when he set up two goals. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, which saw Sheffield United promoted to Championship after six seasons in League One, Basham went on to make 48 appearances and scoring two times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Jack O'Connell", "response": ["Jack O'Connell may refer to:", "* Jack O'Connell (actor) (born 1990), English actor", "* Jack O'Connell (Australian politician) (1903\u20131972), member of the Victorian Legislative Council", "* Jack O'Connell (diplomat) (1921\u20132010), American diplomat and CIA Station chief in Amman, Jordan, 1963\u20131971", "* Jack O'Connell (filmmaker) (1923\u20132019), American director of the 1968 film Revolution", "* Jack O'Connell (English footballer) (born 1994), English footballer", "* Jack O'Connell (Australian footballer) (1902\u20131975), Australian rules footballer", "* Jack O'Connell (American politician) (born 1951), American politician", "* Jack O'Connell (rugby union) (born 1990), Irish rugby union player", "* Jack O'Connell (author) (born 1959), American novelist"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|  Jack O'Connell", "|  Jack O'Connell"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 York City F.C. season", "response": ["Blackburn Rovers defender Jack O'Connell was signed on a one-month loan, while Salford City defender Jameel Ible was signed on a contract for the rest of the season.
