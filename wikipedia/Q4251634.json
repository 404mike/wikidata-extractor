He studied privately with Liszt in Italy from 1863 to 1865, one of the few students allowed to do so, and continued to attend Liszt's master classes in Weimar, Germany regularly until 1885, even after embarking on a solo career. This period of study was unparalleled by any other student of Liszt and led to a particularly close bond between Bache and Liszt. After initial hesitation on the part of English music critics because he was a Liszt pupil, Bache was publicly embraced for his keyboard prowess, even as parts of his repertoire were questioned.\nBache's major accomplishment was the establishment of Liszt's music in England, to which he selflessly devoted himself between 1865 and his death in 1888. This was at the height of the War of the Romantics, when conservative and liberal musical factions openly argued about the future of classical music and the merits of the compositions written in their respective schools. Bache featured several of the orchestral and choral works through an annual series of concerts, which he single-handedly funded, organised and promoted. Likewise, he played an annual series of solo recitals that incorporated Liszt's piano music.\nBache's strategy for presenting these works was one of familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Francis Edward Bache", "response": ["His younger brother, Walter Bache (1842\u20131888), was a successful pianist and conductor."]}, {"page": "Franz Liszt", "response": ["Walter Bache,"]}, {"page": "Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff", "response": ["Both Bronsart and his wife receive many mentions in Liszt's letters.

She was the sister of Francis Edward Bache and Walter Bache; an uncle on her mother's side was James Martineau. In addition to studying under her brother Walter, and with James Stimpson, of Birmingham, she studied at the Munich Conservatorium and subsequently under Karl Klindworth and Frits Hartvigson.", "After an injury to her right hand, Bache gave up public performance excepting occasional Birmingham concerts. In 1883, she moved to London, where she took up teaching and literary musical work. Bache was very successful as a translator from German into English. Among her achievements, mention is made of the librettos of Franz Liszt's 'St. Elizabeth,' Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's 'Bastian and Bastienne,' Engelbert Humperdinck's ' Hansel und Gretel,' Robert Schumann's 'The Rose's Pilgrimage,' and Scenes from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's ' Faust', as well as Liszt's 'Letters'; Heintz's analyses of Richard Wagner's works; Johann Christian Lobe's' Catechism of Music'; Hans von B\u00fclow's annotations of Cramer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin.

He continued to transcribe music by his son-in-law Richard Wagner and seemed equally fond of Italian music. He considered Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns a musical ally, setting his Danse macabre in 1876; this work in turn may have influenced some of Liszt's later diabolic works, such as the Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s macabre. He also championed Russian music of different styles and schools. These composers included Dargomyzhsky, Tchaikovsky, Anton Rubinstein and Cui. Liszt admired the Russians especially for challenging Germanic hegemony over matters of taste and style.Baker, 99, 102-3. One of the most striking of Liszt's late paraphrases is his setting of the Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's opera Almira.

Liszt's last song transcription was on Anton Rubinstein's \"Der Asra\" after a poem by Heine. No words are included, and the keyboard setting is reduced nearly to the absurd. In several parts the melody is missing. One of those parts is that with words, \"Deinen Namen will ich wissen, deine Heimath, deine Sippschaft!\" (\"I want to know your name, your homeland, your tribe!\") The answer is given at the song's end, but again without melody, i.e. with unspoken words. \"Mein Stamm sind jene Asra, die sterben, wenn sie lieben.\" (\"My tribe are those Asras, who are dying when they love.\") Even more hidden, Liszt implemented still another answer in his piece. To the part with the question he put an ossia in which also the original accompaniment has disappeared. As own melody by Liszt, the solitary left hand plays a motive with two triplets, most resembling the opening motive of his Tasso. The key is the Gypsy or Hungarian variant of g-Minor. In this sense it was Liszt's answer that his name was \"Tasso\", with meaning of an artist of outstanding creativity.It is well known that Liszt identified him himself with Tasso. For this reason, the third piece of the Trois odes fun\u00e8bres, following \"La Notte\", is \"La triomphe fun\u00e8bre du Tasso\". Liszt hoped that he, like Tasso,would posthumously be recognized as the creative artist he actually was. His true homeland was art. But besides, he was until the grave \"in heart and mind\" Hungarian."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the Royal Academy of Music", "response": ["* Walter Bache (former Professor of Piano)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Bache", "response": ["He was some time assistant in the school of the Rev.

Edward Higginson of Derby (1781\u20131832), whose eldest daughter, Helen (d. 1877), was the wife of the Rev. James Martineau. He had seven children, of whom Francis Edward Bache, the composer, was the eldest; another was Walter Bache, the musician; the youngest son, John Kentish, some time a dissenting minister, took Anglican orders in 1876.
