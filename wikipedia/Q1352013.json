Crawfurd and Hunt routinely accused those who disagreed with them of believing in \"Rousseau's Noble Savage\". Ultimately, however, their partnership fell apart due to Hunt giving a speech in 1865 entitled On the Negro's place in Nature, in which he defended the institution of slavery in the Confederacy during the end of the American Civil War; Crawfurd, being an ardent abolitionist, cut his ties with Hunt after the speeech. \"As Ter Ellingson demonstrates, Crawfurd was responsible for re-introducing the Pre-Rousseauian concept of 'the Noble Savage' to modern anthropology, attributing it wrongly and quite deliberately to Rousseau.\" In an otherwise rather lukewarm review of Ellingson's book in Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History 4:1 (Spring 2003), Frederick E.

As a result of Western medicine brought by missionaries as well as increased immigration from both within Siam and overseas, Bangkok's population gradually increased as the city modernized in the late 19th century. This growth became even more pronounced in the 1930s, following the discovery of antibiotics. Although family planning and birth control were introduced in the 1960s, the lowered birth rate was more than offset by increased migration from the provinces as economic expansion accelerated. Only in the 1990s have Bangkok's population growth rates decreased, following the national rate. Thailand had long since become highly centralized around the capital.
