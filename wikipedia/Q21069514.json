He prospected for gold in Bendigo, Victoria, ran a photographic business in Bourke Street, Melbourne, then Ballarat and finally Adelaide where he worked for many years with Townsend Duryea, finally founding the Adelaide School of Photography, owned by Duryea. He was one of the founders of the Adelaide branch of the Independent Order of Oddfellows. After the fire in Duryea's studio, the School building took over much of the functions of the King William Street premises. He was co-founder with Robert Carr Castle (1835 \u2013 14 June 1896) in 1879 of the Academy of Music (despite its grandiloquent title, actually a place of light entertainment) on Rundle Street, which burnt down three times. He was a member, and for a time chairman, of the consortium that in 1885 built the Adelaide Arcade.\nHe was elected to the House of Assembly for East Torrens in 1887, beating The Hon.
