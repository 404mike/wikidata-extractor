Helena refuses, stating that Hayate and the others will stop at nothing until DOATEC is destroyed, and she is willing do anything to stop Donovan and Alpha-152 from causing havoc in the world.

The four female fighters begin as rivals, but work together to uncover the secret that the organizer of the tournament is trying to hide. It features an ensemble cast and has various appearances from characters of the franchise, led by Kasumi (Devon Aoki), Christie Allen (Holly Valance) and Tina Armstrong (Jaime Pressly).", "A group of martial arts and combat masters are invited to a fighting contest, \"Dead or Alive\", on an isolated island within an advanced complex, with the ultimate prize of $10 million. Among the competitors are Kasumi, a shinobi ninja-princess looking for her brother Hayate (who was competing in the last tournament), Tina, a professional wrestler setting out to prove she has more potential (complicated by her father Bass  being one of the contenders), Christie, a master thief and assassin, her treacherous partner Maximillian 'Max' Marsh, and Hayabusa, a friend of Kasumi and Hayate who follows Kasumi to keep her safe, using the invitation to DOA for this. A final competitor is Helena Douglas, daughter of the tournament's late founder. When they arrive, they are monitored by the island's supervisor, Dr. Victor Donovan, who, aided by egghead Weatherby, is gathering data (using injected nano-sensors) from the fights for some mysterious project. To add to the situation, an assassin from Kasumi's colony, named Ayane, has followed Kasumi to kill her and wipe away the disgrace the princess has caused to the clan.", "The contest plays out, with multiple contestants fighting and being defeated (including Gen Fu, Bayman, Leon, and Zack), until only Kasumi, Christie, Hayabusa and Tina are left, with Helena being defeated by Christie. During the course of the film, Max and Christie form a plan to steal the fortune stowed away inside a hidden vault. During her fight, Christie sees that the key to finding and unlocking the vault is a tattoo on the back of Helena's neck. Meanwhile, Kasumi begins to suspect Donovan of lying about her brother being killed in the previous tournament, and Hayabusa, infiltrating the main facility to find the truth, is captured. She is more than once confronted and nearly killed by Ayane, who Kasumi tries to convince that Hayate is alive (since it is eventually clear that Ayane loves Hayate). Also, Weatherby begins to fall for Helena, and in the end tells her about what he knows of the mystery project, and that before Helena's father could shut the project down, he died (indicating that he was murdered).", "On the final day of the tournament, wondering where Hayabusa is, Kasumi, Christie and Tina look for him and discover a secret entrance to the main complex, where they find Hayabusa unconscious. They are then gassed and captured. Meanwhile, Helena resolves to stop the mystery project, and has to fight the armed staff of the island, sent to kill her and Weatherby by Donovan. They are followed inside by Max, who finds his way to the vault, and is then knocked out by Bayman, who is working for Donovan. Inside the main complex, Donovan shows the four semifinalists the project he has been developing; an advanced form of neural interface that allows him and others to use the fighters' combined skills to become the ultimate fighter. After 'downloading' the data into the device (shaped like a pair of sunglasses), he then shows that he kept Hayate alive and in peak condition to test the technology. He challenges Hayate to fight and win, if the others are to survive. Hayate accepts and is defeated, then thrown through a wall to die. Hayate is saved by Ayane, and the two of them apparently accept each other.", "With the successful demonstration, Donovan prepares to sell the technology around the world, and begins \"downloading\" it to the watching buyers. Weatherby stops the broadcast and alerts the CIA, which provokes Donovan to head for them. Helena keeps Donovan back while Weatherby frees the others, but both are defeated and Donovan activates a self-destruct sequence which will obliterate the base. Kasumi, Helena, Christie, Tina, Ayane, and Hayate launch a combined attack on Donovan, while Hayabusa and Weatherby find Max and escape with him, despite Max's urge to go back for the money. During the battle with the fighters, Donovan's 'glasses' are knocked off and he is easily paralyzed by Hayate and Kasumi. The fighters then all escape as the base explodes and Donovan is consumed by the flames, making their escape by a hijacked pirates' boat.", "In the final scene, Helena, Ayane, Christie, Tina, and Kasumi are shown together again preparing to fight an army of ninja in Kasumi's palace.", "Additionally, Silvio Simac play Leon, an Italian mercenary, while Derek Boyer appear as Bayman, a Russian soldier.

Sometime ago, the exiled ninja Raidou attacked the village, beating Ayane and defeating Hayate who was originally meant to be Shiden's next heir. As a result, Hayate is crippled and falls into a coma. Upon learning this, Kasumi decided to run away from the village to take revenge on Raidou for Hayate, even though it meant she would be a fugitive and likely to be killed by her own clan. Kasumi is quickly stopped by Ayane, who was ordered to track her down and kill her, but Christie appears in a helicopter and saves Kasumi. Although Kasumi did not know the woman, she went with Christie to safety. Heading towards Helena Douglas' cruise ship Freedom Survivor, Kasumi is introduced to both Christie and Bayman and is told about the \"DOA tournament\", with Raidou being there.

After Kasumi fights her way and manages to reach the final round, she faces against Raidou and defeats him, but then he reawakens more powerful than before.

Alpha over-hears that Helena wants Donovan dead and attacks her, but Helena manages to defeat her. With Genra turned traitor, Hayate requests to his father that he should hunt him down, making Shiden believe Hayate is ready to take over as the leader of the clan instead of Kasumi. Hayate wants to bring Kasumi home first, but Ayane speaks against it, calling Kasumi a traitor, which enrages Hayate and makes him slap her. Thinking that Hayate now hates her, Ayane attempts suicide, but is found by her mother, Ayame. Ayane is upset believing Hayate only cares about Kasumi, but Ayame reminded her that all four of them are family and asks Ayane to save Kasumi. Hayate and Ayane join the third tournament to track down Genra. While on Freedom Survivor, Hayate meets up Hitomi again since his departure when he was Ein, and Hayate tells Hitomi the truth about his ninja identity, much to her surprise. During the tournament, Hayate meets with Helena, who recognizes him as the subject of Project Epsilon. Hayate demands she tells him why Genra joined DOATEC, but she claimed she does not know and both Genra and herself are just puppets of DOATEC. After defeating Helena in battle, he tells her that she should leave DOATEC. Later, Hayate and Ayane meet up with Ryu and Irene, but Irene gets kidnapped by Christie. Ryu runs off to save her, while Hayate and Ayane are confronted by Genra, who he transformed into his Omega form. When Ryu realises that Christie was just a decoy, he returns to aid them, and runs Genra through with his Dragon Sword, giving time for Ayane and Hayate to perform a duel magic attack that strikes Genra before he could regenerate, killing him. When they return to the village, Ayane watches Genra's body cremated as she walks away in tears.", "After Helena became head leader of DOATEC, Donovan discusses with her the biological weapon cloning project, Project Alpha.

One night, Hayate, Ayane, and Ryu attacks the Tri-Tower with Irene and the CIA aiding them. At the same time, Kasumi infiltrates the Tri-Tower and confronts Helena, pleading with her to stop, but Helena replied that the ninja would stop at nothing to destroy DOATEC, and the final product of Project Alpha, Alpha-152. Helena attempts to shoot Kasumi, who is saved by Ryu. While Kasumi makes her way to fight an awakened Alpha-152, Hayate and Ayane use their magic to destroy the Tri-Tower, only to have to face Alpha-152 themselves. With the Tri-Tower in flames, Helena faces Christie one last time, and learns that it was actually her who killed her mother Maria. After finding out the truth, Helena sets of the building's self-destruction and plans to end her own life, with Kasumi and Ayane helplessly watching from afar.
