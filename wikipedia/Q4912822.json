He developed an early interest in language, studying English, French, German and Russian at Kilmarnock Academy and English literature at the University of Edinburgh. His study of the history and status of the Scots language, Scots: The Mither Tongue, his most notable work, was later adapted for a television series, and an audiobook, recorded after setting up a home studio during the COVID-19 lockdown. Kay thought that many people would not have heard ' how the language sounds' in major Scots literature such as Barbour's Brus, R.L. Stevenson's Thrawn Janet, works by MacDiarmid and Burns or the Border Ballads covered in his book: a sound version, he said, would 'fill a big gap' in people's 'knowledge and appreciation of a great tradition'.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scots language", "response": ["*Billy Kay"]}, {"page": "William Kay", "response": ["*Billy Kay (wrestler) (born 1989), Australian professional wrestler", "*Billy Kay (writer) (born 1951), writer, broadcaster and language activist", "*Billy Kay (actor) (born 1983), American film and television actor"]}, {"page": "Abertay Historical Society", "response": ["* No 51.

However, Pennie also received support from well-known figures including actor Michael Sheen, comedian and campaigner Janey Godley, author Neil Gaiman, writer Billy Kay, food writer Nigella Lawson, TV presenter Greg Jenner, and playwright David Greig. Godley said \"People keep sending me videos of a young lassie (Miss Punny Pennie) who is explaining what Scots words mean. Beautiful poetry is coming out of her mouth and her language is just spectacular.\""]}]}}
