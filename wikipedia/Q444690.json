Despite these changes, he has occasionally been accused of plagiarism.\nHis work has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions including Domaine de Kergu\u00e9hennec, Centre d\u2019Art Contemporain, France (2000); Serpentine Gallery, London (2004); Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (2008); Tate Liverpool, England (2009), which travelled to the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin, Ludwig M\u00fazeum, Budapest (2010); \nFrans Hals Museum, Haarlem, The Netherlands (2014); Fondation Vincent Van Gogh, Arles, France (2016); Des Moines Art Center, Iowa (2016); Contemporary Arts Center, Ohio (2017); Rembrandt House Museum, Amsterdam (2017); Museo Stefano Bardini, Florence (2017); and British Museum, London (2018); and numerous group exhibitions including The Saatchi Gallery (1995, 2015); Centre Georges Pompidou (2002, 2014); Venice Biennale, Italian Pavilion, (2003); Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2005); Gwangju Biennale, Korea (2010), Kunsthalle, Vienna (2011), Galerie Rudolfinum, Prague (2012), Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao (2013), Rennie Collection, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (2013), Cognacq-Jay Museum, Paris (2015); Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh (2018), Museum of Fine Arts-Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest (2019); and British Museum, London (2019).\nBrown lives and works in London and Suffolk, England.
