It was named dopamine because it is a monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-\u00c5ke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter."]}, {"page": "1910 in science", "response": ["* George Barger and James Ewens of Wellcome Laboratories in London first synthesize dopamine."]}, {"page": "Pharmaceutical industry", "response": ["While highly effective, the requirement for injection limited the use of epinephrine and orally active derivatives were sought. A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, (actually more similar to norepinephrine,) was identified by Japanese chemists in the Ma Huang plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma.  Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations. Amphetamine was developed by Smith, Kline and French as a nasal decongestant under the trade name Benzedrine Inhaler. Amphetamine was eventually developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications. It received approval as a New and Nonofficial Remedy from the American Medical Association for these uses in 1937 and remained in common use for depression until the development of tricyclic antidepressants in the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Vincent du Vigneaud", "response": ["After a post-doctoral position with John Jacob Abel at Johns Hopkins University Medical School (1927\u20131928), he traveled to Europe as National Research Council Fellow in 1928-1929, where he worked with Max Bergmann and Leonidas Zervas at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Leather Research in Dresden, and with George Barger at the University of Edinburgh Medical School.

In most amphibian organs including the heart, the concentration of adrenaline far exceeds that of noradrenaline, and adrenaline is indeed the main transmitter. In mammals, however, difficulties arose. In a comprehensive structure-activity study of adrenaline-like compounds, Dale and the chemist George Barger in 1910 pointed out that Elliott's hypothesis assumed a stricter parallelism between the effects of sympathetic nerve impulses and adrenaline than actually existed. For example, sympathetic impulses shared with adrenaline contractile effects in the trigone but not relaxant effects in the fundus of the cat's urinary bladder. In this respect, \u2033amino-ethanol-catechol\u2033 \u2013 noradrenaline \u2013 mimicked sympathetic nerves more closely than adrenaline did.

However, nothing definite was brought to light till after the war. In the meantime, Dale created a terminology that since has imprinted the thinking of neuroscientists: that nerve cells should be named after their transmitter, i.e. cholinergic if the transmitter was \u2033a substance like acetylcholine\", and adrenergic if it was \u2033some substance like adrenaline\u2033."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1919", "response": ["*George Barger  (1878 -1939)"]}, {"page": "Joseph John Blackie", "response": ["In 1936 and 1937 he studied the alkaloids of the genus Senecio with Prof George Barger."]}, {"page": "George Hector Percival", "response": ["He became an eminent dermatologist, a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and president of the British Association of Dermatologists in 1961\u201362.
