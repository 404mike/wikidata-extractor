The idea for this story came about when Kit Pedler was being interviewed for a position as science adviser to the series. The producers asked all of the interviewees what would happen if the recently built Post Office Tower somehow took over. Pedler suggested that it would be the work of a rogue computer that communicated with the outside world by means of the telephone system. The producers liked this suggestion and not only offered Pedler the job but developed the idea into a script (one of the few to feature a 'Story Idea by' credit). Pat Dunlop was then hired to write a full set of teleplays from Pedler's idea, but quit after becoming busy with other work, and the teleplays were subsequently done by Ian Stuart Black, who had also written the previous serial, The Savages.", "A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Stuart Black, was published by Target Books in February 1989.", "Category:Doctor Who serials novelised by Ian Stuart Black"]}, {"page": "The Savages (Doctor Who)", "response": ["A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Stuart Black, was published by Target Books in March 1986.", "Category:Doctor Who serials novelised by Ian Stuart Black"]}, {"page": "The Macra Terror", "response": ["A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Stuart Black, was published by Target Books in July 1987.", "Category:Doctor Who serials novelised by Ian Stuart Black"]}, {"page": "Donald Cotton", "response": ["To Cotton's chagrin, both Wiles and Tosh resigned from Doctor Who at the end of December 1965, to be replaced by producer Innes Lloyd and story editor Gerry Davis. Lloyd and Davis disliked the historical genre, believing that the viewing audience was more interested in science-fiction stories, and also felt that the comedic bent of The Gunfighters did not fit with their more serious vision of Doctor Who. For a time, the production team considered cancelling the story altogether and replacing it with Ian Stuart Black's The Savages, which would end up following Cotton's adventure into production. The production team's fears about the quality of The Gunfighters appeared to be borne out when the final three episodes equalled or exceeded the series' lowest Audience Appreciation scores to date. Indeed, The O.K. Corral episode, rating only 30%, would prove to be the all-time low-water mark for Doctor Who. These disastrous figures helped strengthen Lloyd's conviction that historical serials should be eliminated from Doctor Who altogether. This was not the only controversy surrounding The O.K. Corral: a dispute had arisen between director Rex Tucker and Lloyd over the editing of the episode, leading to Tucker requesting that his credit be excised."]}, {"page": "Stewart's Melville College", "response": ["* Ian Stuart Black (1915\u20131997) - novelist, playwright and screenwriter"]}, {"page": "The Invisible Man (1958 TV series)", "response": ["Tim Turner himself appeared visibly in the \"Man in Disguise\" episode, though on this occasion he played Nick, a foreign-accented villain who impersonates Brady.
