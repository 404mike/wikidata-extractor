He rose through the steel industry, where he was in charge of labour relations, and worked as a government adviser during the late 1960s.\nComing to the CBI at the peak of political controversy over the Labour government's attempt to reform trade union law, Adamson held the difficult role of representing industry through the complex struggle over Edward Heath's Industrial Relations Bill. Remarks he made about Government policy on the eve of the February 1974 election were blamed by Heath for the Conservative Party's loss of the election. Adamson was able to unite industry to support the British application to join the European Communities. In later life as Chairman of Abbey National, Adamson led the move to demutualise and convert it from a building society to a bank, and saw an overwhelming majority of the society's members support the move. Also interested in family policy, he set up the Family Policy Studies Centre.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Corpus Christi College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Sir Campbell Adamson"]}, {"page": "February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["A further unforeseen blow to the Conservative's campaign came on 26 February when Campbell Adamson, Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), was reported to have called for the repeal of the Heath Government's Industrial Relations Act, saying that it had \"sullied every relationship between employers and unions at national level.\" Adamson had been closely involved with the Downing Street talks over the mining dispute.

As CBI president he witnessed the fall of the administration of Edward Heath in the wake of the miners' strike, and the re-emergence of the Labour Party under Harold Wilson. He was directly involved, along with CBI director-general Campbell Adamson, in intense and volatile debate on voluntary pay restraint and price controls with Health and trade union leaders.", "Almost immediately he was involved in talks with Heath and the union leaders along with Campbell Adamson to try to prevent industrial action. The CBI team's impression was that Heath showed a good deal more consideration and deference to the unions and to TUC leader Vic Feather. However, neither Heath nor Feather could exert much influence over hard line union men Jack Jones and Hugh Scanlon, and little progress was made. When the miners converted their overtime ban into a strike, Heath called a general election. Two days before polling day Adamson addressed a conference organised by the Industrial Society at which he was asked what the Conservatives should do, if re-elected, about the controversial Industrial Relations Act. Adamson replied \"if I were them I would try to get close to the unions and hammer out something better\", going on to say that amendment of the Act was not possible because \"it is so surrounded by hatred that we must have a more honest try at another Act\".", "Adamson did not realise that his words were being recorded by the BBC. Clapham dissociated the organisation from Adamson's view, and other industrialists were heavily critical. Late on Wednesday 27 February, Adamson offered his resignation to Clapham (the news did not become public until the following day); Clapham refused to accept it, writing back that Adamson was \"perhaps uniquely qualified to organize\" the CBI and deal with government. However Adamson insisted and Clapham undertook to consult with members. In the meantime the election resulted in the surprise defeat of Edward Heath; the incoming government swiftly abolished the Industrial Relations Act. In his memoirs Heath disputed that Adamson could have been unaware he was being recorded, and wrote that \"If Campbell Adamson had wanted Labour to win, he could not have worked more effectively on their behalf\".Heath, Edward,\"The Course of My Life\"(Hodder and Stoughton, 1998, p. 516)"]}, {"page": "1976 New Year Honours", "response": ["* William Owen Campbell Adamson, Director-General, Confederation of British Industry."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2000", "response": ["*Sir Campbell Adamson, 78, British industrialist."]}]}}
