Travelling at his own expense carrying an 85\u00a0lb pack, he departed London Victoria station on 30 November 1875.  The Russians announced they would protect the soldier along the route, but to all intents and purposes this proved impossible.  The accomplishment of this task, in the winter of 1875\u20131876, with the aim of reciprocity for India and the Tsarist State, was described in his book A Ride to Khiva, and brought him immediate fame.  The city of Merv was inaccessible, but presented a potential military flashpoint.  The Russians knew that British Intelligence gathered information along the frontier.  Similar expeditions had taken place under Captain George Napier (1874) and Colonel Charles MacGregor (1875).  By Christmas, Burnaby had arrived at Orenburg.
