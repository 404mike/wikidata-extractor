Robin Darwall-Smith and Michael Riordan have lauded it as \"the first scholarly history, not just of University College, but of any Oxford or Cambridge college\", and \"the basis for all further histories of the college\". Early-20th-century historian of University College, William Carr, named it \"the first Oxford College history of real historical value\", still maintaining \"its position as an authority to which many writers on early Oxford have since been beholden\". Arthur Oswald, in the 1954 Victoria County History of the college, acknowledged his debt to the Annals, summarising it as \"a remarkable achievement\", affirming that \"though such iconoclasm was highly unpopular\", \"the [Annals] conclusions were inescapable\"."]}]}}
