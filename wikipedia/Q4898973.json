She became a millworker alongside her mother after leaving school at the age of fifteen. She joined the Revolutionary Workers' Groups (RWG) in 1932. In 1933, she was involved in the Outdoor Relief Strike. She then attended the International Lenin School in Moscow until 1935.The RWG established the Communist Party of Ireland (CPI) in 1933, and Sinclair became a leading member. In 1940 she was arrested after the CPI paper Unity published an article allegedly sympathetic to the IRA, and she was sentenced to two months' imprisonment in 1941. The same year she became a full-time party worker in Belfast.\nWhen the all-Ireland CPI dissolved in 1941, Sinclair remained an active member of the Communist Party of Northern Ireland (CPNI) and served as its Secretary from 1942 to 1945. She stood for the group in Belfast Cromac at the 1945 Northern Ireland general election, taking almost one third of the votes. In 1947, Sinclair was appointed full-time secretary of the Belfast and District Trades Union Council.In 1941 Sinclair was arrested and imprisoned following the publishing a controversial article in the Red Hand, the official party paper of the Communist Party of Ireland. The Communist Party of Ireland and the Red Hand were worried by the IRA's willingness to explore links with Nazi Germany in order to secure support for a United Ireland, and this was expressed in the Red Hand, questioning if the IRA was turning into a pro-fascist organisation. Republicans requested an opportunity to respond to this criticism, and the Red Hand allowed Jack Brady to write an article voicing their views. However, the IRA was a proscribed (banned) organisation at this time in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and publishing their material was illegal. As part editor of the party Sinclair was held responsible for the article and subsequently interned. Betty was originally sentenced to 2 years of prison time but was able to reduce it to 2 months upon appeal. She served her sentence in Armagh Jail, in conditions she described as \"medieval\".Sinclair campaigned for the restoring of American Paul Robeson's passport. Robeson, a noted musician and activist, had supported the allies during World War 2. However, due to his long history of supporting left-wing politics and his pro-Soviet Union stance, as well as his anti-colonial attitude, he was denied a passport by the United States State Department. In 1958, Sinclair personally met with Robeson when he came to Belfast as part of a worldwide tour.Sinclair was the Trades Council's representative at the talks which founded the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in 1967, and she served as NICRA chair until 1969, when she resigned, claiming it had become dominated by ultra leftists and was worsening sectarian divisions. She stepped down from her trades council post in 1975, and moved to Prague to work for the World Marxist Review, before returning to Belfast. She died in a fire in her flat in East Belfast on Christmas Day, 1981.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Unionism in Ireland", "response": ["Since 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, a broad labour and republican grouping with Communist Party veteran Betty Sinclair as chair. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy\", NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches."]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association", "response": ["* 6.

There were some changes as the steering committee became NICRA's executive council, with Ken Banks of the Ardoyne Tenants Association replacing Jim Andrews; Kevin Agnew, a republican solicitor, replacing McMillen; and Terence O'Brien (unaffiliated) replacing McGettigan.

There was opposition to the idea from some in NICRA's executive, in particular from the NICRA chair and veteran communist Betty Sinclair who felt that unionists would see the march simply as a nationalist demonstration. After extended discussion the proposal was agreed and a march organised for 24 August.Hanley & Millar 2009 p.102", "The march is considered to have passed off peacefully, though there are accounts of minor stone throwings with several marchers trying to break through the police line only to be rebuffed by the RUC and restrained by the marshalls.  The chairperson of NICRA Betty Sinclair managed to convince the marchers to restrain themselves and show that they were \"peaceful people asking for our civil rights in an orderly manner\". The crowds dispersed without incident. Footage of the march can be found of RTE archives."]}, {"page": "Communist Party of Northern Ireland", "response": ["The CPNI stood their own candidates in the 1945 Northern Ireland general election.
