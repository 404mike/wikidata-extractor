In 1920, the  British Trade Corporation was founded in Belgrade. Although this bank only operated until 1928, its work led to serious improvements in the local industry, primarily mining. In the same period, relations between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Church of England were established. Several big donations of books by English to Serbian libraries took place in the 1920s. British citizens were the main foreign sponsors of scientific research in the interwar period. Archaeological excavations in Vin\u010da were funded by sir Charles Hyde."]}, {"page": "Hyde, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Hyde"]}]}}
