He went on to play for Halifax Town and Darlington before signing for Bradford City in 2006. He remained with The Bantams until 2010 before joining Maltese Premier League side Hibernians, during a three-year spell in Malta Clarke also played for Msida Saint-Joseph and Marsaxlokk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Bower", "response": ["On 13 February 2007, he was named as Bradford captain by Wetherall, while he was caretaker manager. Bower has regularly picked up gongs at City's annual awards and also writes a column in newspaper the Telegraph & Argus. The following season Bower lost his place to Matthew Clarke before being ruled out due to an injury he sustained in a pre-match warm-up at Accrington Stanley on New Year's Day 2008. He returned to action on 8 March 2008, when he came on as a second-half substitute in City's 2\u20131 at Stockport County. Later that season, he was once again handed the captain's armband in a home match against Morecambe, ten years after he made his debut for the club.", "However, Bower was kept out of the team at the start of the 2008\u201309 season by Graeme Lee and Matthew Clarke. He missed the first four matches before he came on as a substitute in a 3\u20132 defeat to Aldershot Town after Clarke suffered a calf injury. He continued to struggle to break into the first team, and suffered another setback when he injured a thigh in a reserve match."]}, {"page": "David McGurk", "response": ["McGurk signed a new one-year contract with Darlington in May 2005 and was soon told he was allowed to leave the club after not being guaranteed first team football for 2005\u201306. He was loaned out to York for a second time on 2 August 2005 on a six-month deal, so his progress could be monitored and could play regular first-team football. Darlington manager Hodgson said McGurk could have been brought back to the club when his loan at York ended, which he did having made 24 appearances and scored one goal for York. He made his first Darlington appearance in 10 months as a replacement for Shelton Martis in a 2\u20131 home victory over Peterborough United on 14 January 2006. However, after making one more appearance for Darlington, he rejoined York on loan until the end of 2005\u201306 on 24 January 2006 and finished the loan with 15 appearances and one goal. Following this \"hugely successful\" loan spell he made his last appearance of the season with Darlington after starting in a 1\u20131 home draw with Wrexham on 6 May 2006 to cover for the suspended Matthew Clarke."]}, {"page": "Barry Conlon", "response": ["He was largely used as a substitute at the start of the 2008\u201309 season, but scored his first goal of the campaign during a start against Leeds United in the Football League Trophy, as Bradford lost 2\u20131. His first league goal of the season came just minutes after coming on as a substitute against Luton Town, to help Bradford gain a point with ten men. Having scored two more goals, Conlon was rewarded with a rare start against Barnet, when he scored two goals but City could only draw 3\u20133. Conlon scored his 100th league goal from the penalty spot on 25 November 2008, the winning goal as Bradford City beat Chesterfield at Valley Parade. He marked the occasion by removing his shirt, revealing a vest with '100' emblazoned across the front, for which he was shown a yellow card. Conlon extended his stay at Bradford for another six months in December 2008. In March 2009, Conlon and defender Matthew Clarke were both dropped for a game with Exeter City and punished following a breach of club discipline. Manager Stuart McCall said: \"It's an internal matter and has been dealt with in the dressing room.\" Conlon was recalled to the side but made one only more appearance before he was sent on loan."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["The New Year started with a number of changes off the field. Loan signing Ndumbu-Nsungu returned to Gillingham but Heckingbottom's deal was extended to allow him to play against Accrington Stanley on New Year's Day, before a permanent deal was finalised the following week. Midfielder Lee Bullock was also signed on a loan transfer from Hartlepool United. City beat Accrington 2\u20130 with Matthew Clarke scoring his first for the club and Joe Colbeck adding his first since he returned from his loan spell at Darlington. It was followed up with another win, when Thorne scored City's first hat-trick for two years, to defeat Notts County 3\u20130.
