The goal conceded came as Poole managed to punch an indirect free kick into his own goal; he constantly ran out of his area during the match and did not impress. Despite this he signed as a professional in 1898 and was utilized as a reserve until January 1900, at which point he became the first choice goalkeeper. He played 15 Second Division games in the 1899\u20131900 season after his rival, Herbert Birchenough, was sold on. He lost his place to Alfred Maybury in September 1900 though, after just two games, and was released at the end of the 1900\u201301 season.
