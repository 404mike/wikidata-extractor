The I-Kikan and the League trained a number of INA recruits \u2014and civilian volunteers from Malaya\u2014 in intelligence and subversion activities. Some of these training schools were opened in Burma and Singapore, the latter under the direction of N. Raghavan were called Swaraj (Independence in Hindi) schools.
