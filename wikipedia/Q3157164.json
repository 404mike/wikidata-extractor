Hollingsworth", "response": ["Dorothy Hollingsworth OBE (1916-1994) was a British nutritionist and scientist, who demonstrated that the quality of the British diet was greatly improved by rationing.  Hollingsworth both documented and contributed to the improvements in British nutrition during the Second World War. She worked with Jack Drummond at the Ministry of Food during the 1940s, and completed a revised edition of The Englishman's Food after Drummond's death. For twenty-one years, she was responsible for the nutrition bureau at the Ministry of Food and later, in the 1970s, became the director of the British Nutrition Foundation.", "In 1941, Hollingsworth took a job at the Ministry of Food where she worked on a wartime food survey, designed to find out how well the population of Britain was coping with the shortages of rationing. This project later, in 1945, became the Family Food Survey, and in 1950 was reborn as the National Food Survey, which was an important resource for measuring the nutritional status of British people in the 1950s. In 1945, her job was transferred to work under Jack Drummond, the chief scientific adviser to the government at the Ministry of Food. In 1949, she took over from Magnus Pyke as the principal scientific officer at the Ministry as the head of the nutrition bureau. Her job covered all aspects of national nutrition: statistics on diet, food science, education. In 1958, she was appointed an OBE in recognition of her public service to nutrition in Britain.", "In 1952, Hollingsworth's former colleague Jack Drummond was brutally murdered, together with his wife and daughter, while on holiday in France. Drummond had been intending to produce a new updated version of his book The Englishman's Food, originally published in 1939. The publishers now asked Dorothy Hollingsworth to prepare the new edition, taking account of 'advances in nutrition' that had occurred in the years since 1939. Hollingsworth wrote that 'much was accomplished during the Second World War' in nutrition because 'owing to rationing and control, it was difficult to obtain an ill-balanced diet'. Her data showed that the 1947 diet was better than the 1934-38 diet 'the most striking improvements being in calcium, vitamin B1, nicotinic acid, protein (mainly in vegetable protein) and vitamin C'. Among other observations, Hollingsworth noted that, while there were still 'class differences in the consumption of vegetables and fruit' in Britain, there was, since the war, a much smaller difference between the classes in vegetable consumption. She also noted the falling popularity of milk puddings such as 'rice, tapioca and sago'."]}, {"page": "Sir Norman Wright", "response": ["After the Second World War (in 1947) he was appointed Chief Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Food (succeeding Sir Jack Drummond) and was central to the food rationing system in post-war Britain and in attempts to keep the population healthy and well-fed.

His contact with Krebs would influence his career choice in chemical pathology. He joined the chemical pathology department at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, at the Hammersmith Hospital in London as a registrar. In 1954 he became the Sir Jack Drummond Memorial Fellow, which enabled him to embark on a career of research in biochemistry, initially under the mentorship of Professor Earl King. He designed and constructed a flame photometer that enabled very accurate measurements of blood calcium and magnesium levels. This led to studies of magnesium deficiency. Shortly after Douglas Harold Copp's discovery of the hormone calcitonin, Macintyre's group demonstrated that the hormone was produced in the parafollicular cells of the thyroid rather than the parathyroid gland as suggested by Copp. In 1967 the Gardner International Award was made jointly to Copp and Macintyre for their work on the origin and existence of calcitonin. Macintyre's laboratory also purified and then sequenced both porcine calcitonin and human calcitonin. His team also demonstrated calcitonin gene-related peptide, which they went on to sequence and then characterise."]}, {"page": "M. B.
