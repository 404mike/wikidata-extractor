This had followed on from an earlier sentiment of pan-Celtic feeling at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, held in Liverpool in 1900. Another influence was Fournier's attendance at Feis Ceoil in the late 1890s, which drew musicians from the different Celtic nations. The two leaders formed somewhat of an idiosyncratic pair; Fournier, of French parentage embraced an ardent Hibernophilia and learned the Irish language, while FitzPatrick descended from ancient Irish royalty (the Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig of Osraige), but was serving in the British Army and had earlier been a Conservative MP (indeed, the original Pan-Celtic Congress was delayed for a year because of the Second Boer War).. The main intellectual organ of the Celtic Association was Celtia: A Pan-Celtic Monthly Magazine, edited by Fournier, which ran from January 1901 until 1904 and was briefly revived in 1907 before finally ending for good in May 1908. Its inception was welcomed by Breton Fran\u00e7ois Jaffrennou. An unrelated publication \"The Celtic Review\" was founded in 1904 and ran until 1908."]}, {"page": "Emily Lawless", "response": ["She was born at Lyons House below Lyons Hill, Ardclough, County Kildare. She spent part of her childhood with the Kirwans of Castle Hackett, County Galway, her mother's family, and drew on West of Ireland themes for many of her works. Her grandfather was Valentine Lawless, a member of the United Irishmen and son of a convert from Catholicism to the Church of Ireland. Her father was Edward Lawless, 3rd Baron Cloncurry (d. 1896), thus giving her the title of \"The Honourable\". The death of her father when she was a girl plunged the family into financial difficulties which, compounded by her lack of access to family assets as a woman, meant that she relied on income from her books. Emily had five brothers and three sisters. Her brother Edward Lawless, who inherited the family home, was a landowner with strong Unionist opinions, a policy of not employing Roman Catholics in any position in his household, and chairman of the Property Defence Association set up in 1880 to oppose the Land League and \"uphold the rights of property against organised combination to defraud\". Emily Lawless was not in good terms with her brother Edward. The prominent Anglo-Irish unionist and later nationalist, Home Rule politician Horace Plunkett was a cousin. Lord Castletown, Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown was also a cousin. According to Betty Webb Brewer, writing in 1983 for the journal of the Irish American Cultural Institute, \u00c9ire/Ireland: \"An unflagging unionist, she recognised the rich literary potential in the native tradition and wrote novels with peasant heroes and heroines, Lawless depicted with equal sympathy the Anglo-Irish landholders.\" This is the prevalent view of Lawless, yet she unequivocally referred to her Irish \"patriotism\",Emily Lawless, 'Traits and Confidences', London: Methuen, 1898, p. 37. and her unshakeable love of Ireland, and several of her short stories denounce the inequalities brought about by colonialism and landlordism in Ireland. W.B.Yeats wrote scathingly about Lawless's supposed stereotyping of Irish peasants, and his views later contributed to the neglect of her work. Similarly, her initial opposition to female suffrage has been often read as an anti-feminist position (rather than a 'feminism of difference'), yet much of her work makes a strong case for female autonomy, in financial and creative terms, and Lawless was a noted and popular writer in the 'New Woman' movement which swept English fiction and journalism in the late nineteenth century. It has been speculated that she may have been lesbian and that Lady Sarah Spencer, dedicatee of A Garden Diary (1901) was her life-partner. She died at Gomshall, Surrey."]}, {"page": "Osraige", "response": ["After the initial Norman Invasion of Ireland, the famous and formidable William Marshal arrived in Osraige by 1192 and acquired claims to the land through his marriage to Isabel de Clare, daughter of Strongbow and Aoife Mac Murchada, daughter of Diarmait Mac Murchada. Marshal began stone construction on the large fortification at Kilkenny Castle which was completed by 1195 and was largely responsible for forcing the Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draigs from their southern power base around the River Nore; their ancient rights revoked and a decree of expulsion pronounced on the entire clan.  The northern districts of Mag Lacha and Ui Foircheallain (henceforth called Upper Ossory which had formerly broken away from Osraige under Ua Caellaighe/Ua Fael\u00e1in and Ua Dubhsl\u00e1ine rule since 1103, and which had subsequently seen English settlement from the Normans, thus became targeted by the expelled Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draigs and their Ossorian followers for resettlement.  This caused a land war in Upper Ossory between those clans already residing there, the new English settlers, and the incoming clans from south and central Osraige driven out by Earl Marshal, which lasted more than a century and a half before the Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draigs established full supremacy over the region. Subsequently, the chaos of this poorly recorded conflict caused the then bishop of Ossory, Felix Ua Duib Sl\u00e1in, to permanently remove the episcopal see from Aghaboe and initiate construction of the cathedral in Kilkenny. Upper Ossory thus remained an independent Gaelic lordship until the mid-sixteenth century, with its Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig rulers retaining claims to the kingship of all Osraige and being recorded as such, or sometimes \"King of the Slieve Blooms\".LC1269.6  The majority of Osriage was divided up and partitioned amongst various Norman adventurers, especially those within the household of William Marshal who arrived to take charge of lands which were claimed by his wife's inheritance.  Likely arriving under Marshal was Sir Thomas FitzAnthony who was granted extensive lands in lower Ossory and elsewhere (Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny is named after him) and was an important and successful administrator for the Crown; being made seneschal of all Leinster from 1215 to at least 1223.  Upper Ossory was formally incorporated into the Henry VIII's Lordship of Ireland by the submission of Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 1st Baron Upper Ossory under the policy of surrender and regrant in 1537. This ironically had the effect of preserving Gaelic culture in Upper Ossory long into the future, since the Crown no longer dealt harshly with the territory.Edwards, David. \"Collaboration without Anglicization: The Macgiollapadraig Lordship and Tudor Reform.\" Gaelic Ireland: c. 1250 \u2013 c. 1650: Land, Lordship & Settlement.(2001) p.77-97.  In 1541, The Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig was ennobled as Baron Upper Ossory. Other members of the family were later created Earl of Upper Ossory and Baron Castletown, the last of whom, Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown, died in 1927. Because they clung to the last fragments of the kingdom, that Ossorian lineage is marked as one of the oldest known or most continuously settled dynasties in Western Europe.", "The name of the former kingdom survives in the present-day town names of Borris-in-Ossory and Durrow-in-Ossory, as well as in the now defunct Ossory UK Parliament constituency. The name also survives in the title of the annual Ossory Agricultural Show, a livestock, produce and crafts competition founded in 1898 and patronized by Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown, and now held in western Coolfin County Laois.  The famous artist Ronald Ossory Dunlop bore the kingdom's name personally, perhaps in part because his mother's maiden name was Fitzpatrick. Three ships of the British Royal Navy bore the name HMS Ossory. A thoroughbred racehorse named Ossory (1885\u20131889) was owned by the 1st Duke of Westminster. Several Irish-speaking schools in Kilkenny also use the name Osra\u00ed including Gaelscoil Osra\u00ed and Col\u00e1iste Pobail Osra\u00ed.    Ossory Bridge, one of Kilkenny City's main bridges, now has a timber-plank pedestrian bridge running beneath it, which is the longest of its kind in Europe."]}, {"page": "Baron Castletown", "response": ["thumb|right|200px|Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown."]}, {"page": "Bernard Edward Barnaby FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown"]}, {"page": "BEB FitzPatrick", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors of Ireland", "response": ["*Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown (1849\u20131937) "]}, {"page": "Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig dynasty", "response": ["*Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown KP CMG PC (I) (29 July 1849 \u2013 29 May 1937) was a soldier in the British army, a Conservative Member of Parliament, and was the last recognized Chief of the Name for Clann Giolla Ph\u00e1draig."]}, {"page": "L\u00f3egaire Birn B\u00faadach", "response": ["L\u00f3egaire Birn B\u00faadach (pronunciation) (fl. 1st or 2nd century AD) was the second king of Osraige after the death of his father, \u00d3engus Osrithe.Baldwin, Stewart.
