He scored his first career goal and Swindon's first of the 2011\u201312 season during the opening game of the season against Crewe. The goal was a penalty following a foul on Billy Bodin by Adam Dugdale. The game ended in a 3\u20130 win for Swindon. Kennedy went on to start the first thirteen matches of the new campaign. With Swindon making an indifferent start, di Canio brought Liam Ridehalgh in on loan from Huddersfield Town on 28 September 2011. As a result, Kennedy was dropped from the first team, only appearing in the 4\u20131 FA Cup win over Huddersfield in which Ridehalgh was not allowed to play. It wasn't until the turn of the year when Kennedy again made the starting eleven, appearing in four consecutive victories, including a famous win over Premier League side Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup. After appearing in a big 4\u20131 win at promotion chasing Southend and then helping Swindon to the 2012 Football League Trophy Final the following week, Kennedy made just two more starts over the next two months as during the buildup to the Wembley final, di Canio signed Jay McEveley on loan from Barnsley and thrust him straight into the starting eleven. Kennedy was to make just one more appearance for Swindon, in a 2\u20131 defeat at Aldershot Town in a game where a point would have sealed promotion. Even though Swindon won the League Two title, Kennedy was released on 18 May 2012 after his contract was not going to be renewed and he left with four other Swindon players."]}, {"page": "Lee Brown (footballer)", "response": ["Brown started on the opening day of the 2017\u201318 season in a 1\u20130 defeat to Charlton Athletic.

With the January transfer window now open, Argyle confirmed the permanent signings of Nick Chadwick and Darren Purse, who had previously only been on loan from Stockport County and Millwall respectively, as well as signing former youth goalkeeper Ollie Chenoweth from Bideford.

However, it soon became clear that he had arrived as a replacement for his namesake Billy Kee who was sold to Burton Albion the very next day.  Kee had struggled to secure a place in the starting line up under Paul Buckle and, with Howe and Atieno beginning to establish an effective striking partnership under Martin Ling, Kee took the opportunity to join the Brewers and return to his native Midlands. Some pride was restored after the Crawley humiliation with a 1\u20131 draw at Dagenham & Redbridge, leaving the Gulls' undefeated away record intact, at least as far as the League was concerned.  However, a trip to Whaddon Road in the Johnstone Paints Trophy saw another early cup exit for Torquay at the hands of Cheltenham Town.", "With Rene Howe suffering from a hamstring injury and Billy Bodin on international duty with the Wales under-21 squad, Martin Ling was presented with a mini striker crisis before the visit of Macclesfield Town for the first fixture of the month. Despite this, Torquay managed to register their biggest win of the campaign so far with a 3\u20130 defeat of the Silkmen thanks to first goals of the season from Brian Saah, Chris McPhee and Eunan O'Kane.  Howe was fit enough to be restored to the starting line-up alongside Bodin for the next match which, ironically, resulted in a lacklustre 0\u20130 draw with Northampton Town at the Sixfields Stadium.  This was then followed up by two further draws against Cheltenham Town and Rotherham United, both at Plainmoor.  Although these were far more entertaining matches than the Northampton stalemate, it was concerning that Torquay had fallen behind within the first five minutes of both games.  However, the Gulls did at least show the desire to fight back in both games, gaining a 2\u20132 result against Cheltenham and finishing the epic Rotherham encounter with a 3\u20133 scoreline.  Nevertheless, Martin Ling was now growing concerned at the prospect of Torquay becoming the League's 'draw specialists'.", "Torquay got the New Year off to a flying start with a 2\u20131 victory over Plymouth Argyle.  It was the first time the Gulls had completed the League double over their Devon neighbours for over 40 years and their first win of any description at Home Park since January 2000.  The scoring was opened by Billy Bodin and it was to be his last contribution to the Gulls before he returned to Swindon Town following the completion of his loan deal.  Despite Martin Ling's best efforts, Robins boss Paolo Di Canio was reluctant to let Bodin return to Plainmoor, particularly with Torquay's recent good form making them potential rivals in the promotion race. With Brian Saah coming back to full fitness, defender Tom Aldred also returned to his parent club without making an appearance for the Gulls while Ed Palmer, Ray Spear and Lloyd Macklin all returned to Torquay following their loan spells at Truro, Bideford and Salisbury City respectively.", "With the squad now missing Chris Robertson and Billy Bodin, Martin Ling sought to bring in replacements for the departed pair.  First in was former Wales under-21 winger Nathan Craig.  Currently a free agent, Craig had impressed Ling while playing for the reserves and was offered what amounted to an extended trial until the end of the season. Another new face arrived in the shape of defender Angus MacDonald who was brought in on loan from Reading for the rest of the season. The new players had yet to make an appearance before Torquay's run of good form came to a shuddering halt with a surprise 2\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor to struggling Bradford City.  Fans may well have been wondering if they were feeling the delayed effects of the Manager of the Month 'curse' when the Gulls suffered a second successive loss away to Gillingham.  The 2\u20130 defeat at Priestfield ended in bizarre circumstances with the assistant referee flagging for a penalty when Brian Saah had seemingly brought down former Gulls-loanee Gavin Tomlin in the penalty box.  However, referee Jock Waugh (who had originally waved play-on) decided to send off Joe Oastler instead of Saah.  However, following an appeal, the FA rectified the error and the one-match ban was switched from Oastler to Saah.", "|5 || FW ||  || 15 || Billy Bodin || 5 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 5", "|15 ||  || FW || Billy Bodin || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0", "|Billy Bodin"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["!
