As a result, the FCA said it had sent notices to some (unnamed) former Carillion directors warning of possible enforcement action (possible sanctions include public censure, fines and suspensions from holding certain positions). In January 2021, the Insolvency Service said it would seek to ban eight former Carillion directors from holding senior boardroom positions, namely: Philip Green, Richard Howson, Keith Cochrane, Richard Adam and Zafar Khan, and non-executive directors Andrew Dougal, Alison Horner and Ceri Powell.", "*Keith Cochrane, interim CEO (director since July 2015)*\u2020"]}, {"page": "Kirby Misperton", "response": ["Third Energy began removing equipment from the site in early February 2018, as questions about the company's finances and management continued, including about the September 2017 appointments of former Carillion interim CEO Keith Cochrane as non-executive chairman, and of Jitesh Gadhia, a Conservative party peer and donor, as a non-executive director.
