Brooks was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium.  He was born at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.\nBrooks made two first-class appearances for Nottinghamshire in 1877, both against Surrey.  In his first match at Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 150 all out, with Brooks scoring 6 runs before he was dismissed by James Southerton.  In response, Surrey made 103 all out in their first-innings, with Brooks taking the wickets of George Elliott and Allen Chandler to finish with figures of 2/10 from twelve overs.  Responding in their second-innings, Nottinghamshire made 120 all out, with Brooks being dismissed for 3 runs by George Strachan.  In their second-innings, Surrey made 149 all out, with Brooks taking the wickets of Harry Jupp and Chandler, to finish with figures of 2/30 from 26.1 overs.  Nottinghamshire won the match by 18 runs.  In the return fixture at The Oval, Surrey won the toss and elected to bat, making 250 all out in their first-innings, during which Brooks took the wicket of George Jones to finish with figures of 1/45 from 32.1 overs.  Nottinghamshire could then only manage just 97 all out in their first-innings, with him ending the innings not out on 1.  Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, Nottinghamshire were dismissed for 247, with Brooks himself dismissed for a duck by Ted Barratt.  Requiring 95 for victory, Surrey reached their target with three wickets to spare.He died at the town of his birth on 20 November 1911.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arnold Fothergill", "response": ["Somerset County Cricket Club was founded in 1875, and although they initially struggled financially, Fothergill and Alfred Brooks were employed as the club's first professionals in 1880.Roebuck (1991), p. 23. Fothergill played his first recorded match for the county in July of that year, facing a team of sixteen men from Weston-super-Mare, taking thirteen wickets in the match. Throughout 1880, he was regularly Somerset's leading wicket-taker in their matches; he collected five wickets in an innings against the Marylebone Cricket Club twice, Hertfordshire, and Leicestershire. In 1881, Fothergill was included in the Somerset team to face Kent in Bath. The Kent captain, Richard Thornton objected to Fothergill's presence, correctly pointing out that he was not qualified to play for Somerset. As a result, Fothergill was removed from the side, and did not appear for the side in county cricket again that season, while he served his qualification. He did appear once for the county, against the MCC, taking four wickets in the first innings, and scoring 47 runs as an opening batsman."]}, {"page": "Alfred Brooks", "response": ["Alfred Brooks may refer to:", "* Alfred Brooks (cricketer) (1846\u20131911), English cricketer", "* Alfred Brooks (dancer) (1916\u20132005), American modern dancer, founder of a modern dance company called Munt-Brooks", "* Alfred Brooks, English businessman, co-founder of Justerini & Brooks", "* Alfred Brooks, title character of Robert Lipsyte's novel, The Contender"]}]}}
