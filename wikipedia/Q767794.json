The partnership did not prove to be successful and the pair narrowly avoided steering Burnley into the bottom tier of English football. Only a home victory over Plymouth Argyle on the last day staved off relegation. Roeder proved to be both an unpopular and controversial figure to the Burnley fans, hitting a low point when he was reported to have said that star player Glen Little was \"not fit to lace the boots\" of manager Chris Waddle. Roeder left his role at Burnley alongside Waddle when the pair departed the club after only a single season in charge."]}, {"page": "Wingate & Finchley F.C.", "response": ["The club finished mid-table in its first season in the Premier Division, before surviving a relegation scare in 2012\u201313 with one match to spare. In 2013\u201314, the club were relegated on goal difference behind East Thurrock United despite a final day 5\u20130 victory. However the drama did not end there, as the resignation of Worksop Town from the Northern Premier League gave Wingate & Finchley a much welcomed reprieve from relegation. The club finished the 2015\u201316 season in 13th position on 60 points. On 8 October 2018, the club pulled a coup by employing Nicky Shorey and Glen Little as managers.

Holdsworth wasted no time making his mark on the team, bringing in forwards Peter Vincenti, Tim Sills, and Alex Rodman \u2013 as well as defender Simon Grand on loan from Fleetwood \u2013 before the end of the month. There were also players leaving the club during this period of transition, with both Glen Little and Wesley Ngo Baheng being released, whilst Anthony Straker and Damian Spencer were sent out on loan. Holdsworth's first game in charge resulted in a creditable 1\u20131 draw away to high-flying Bury, and he also improved on Aldershot's poor home form; winning his first game at \"The Rec\" 1\u20130 against Bradford City, whilst a last-minute Luke Guttridge free-kick gave the \"Shots\" a second consecutive home win 3\u20132 against Crewe. He continued attempting to strengthen the squad throughout February, with loan signings Albert Jarrett and Luke Medley from Lincoln and Mansfield respectively, though neither had a large impact on the team with only a handful of appearances between them. Holdsworth also signed former \"Shots\" goalkeeper Mikhael Jaimez-Ruiz, who made 62 appearances in a previous spell at the club. On the pitch, Aldershot went on a run of five consecutive draws, the first away to league leaders Chesterfield who required a late equaliser to rescue a point."]}, {"page": "Kevin Dillon (English footballer)", "response": ["On 9 November 2009, Dillon was confirmed as the new manager of Aldershot Town, succeeding Wycombe Wanderers-bound Gary Waddock. His contract was to run until the end of the 2010\u201311 season. Against all odds he led the club to the 2009\u201310 playoffs with a game to spare after a run of just one defeat in ten games. The club's sixth-place finish is still their highest ever league finish to date. Despite such a successful campaign, Dillon made several changes to his squad for the start of the 2010\u201311 season. He brought in no fewer than ten new faces, including arguably the most eye catching deal of the summer in League Two when he completed the signing of Glen Little from Sheffield United. Despite all the transfer activity, The Shots made a solid start and lost just one of their opening nine league games, as well as progressing through to the second round of the Football League Trophy for the first time in the club's history. But on 10 January 2011, after a run of just two wins in the previous ten League games and with attendances declining, Dillon and assistant Gary Owers left the club by mutual agreement."]}, {"page": "List of Derry City F.C. players", "response": ["* Glen Little"]}, {"page": "Glenn Little", "response": ["#REDIRECT Glen Little"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["Reading's first match in the Championship was a home game against Plymouth Argyle on 6 August and despite dominating the game Reading lost 1 \u2013 2.
