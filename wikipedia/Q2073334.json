The track was re-recorded and produced by Collins; Stock sang on the track under the alias Chris Britton. In January 1984 Stock and Aitken arranged to meet Waterman at his office in the Stiff Records building, Camden Town. Waterman was seeking a new partnership and in February 1984 they went into the Marquee Studio in Wardour Street Soho to record the song \"The Upstroke\" for 'Agents Aren't Aeroplanes'- a front for their concept of a female Frankie Goes To Hollywood. The record was released on Proto Records run by Barry Evangeli and Nick East and distributed by RCA. \"The Upstroke\" achieved popularity in the gay clubs and discos where many new records were being found and subsequently promoted into the mainstream as Hi-NRG.", "In 1987 Pete Waterman formed PWL the in-house label of SAW and one of the first artists to be released on the label was Australian soap star, Kylie Minogue.

By the time Kylie entered the studio she was due on a plane back to Australia later that day. In 40 minutes Stock and Aitken had written the song, \"I Should Be So Lucky\", recorded a backing track and Kylie's vocals. \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was released by PWL in February 1988 and climbed to the No. 1 spot in March where it stayed for five weeks, the joint longest running No. 1 of 1988. It also went to number 1 in 25 other territories including Kylie Minogue's native Australia. With demand for a follow up single, Kylie wasn't keen on returning to England to work with SAW again after the rushed treatment she had received. Stock flew to Australia to meet Kylie and her parents at her home to apologise and successfully convinced her to record a follow-up single \"Got to Be Certain\" which reached No. 2 in the UK charts. When her debut album Kylie was released in August 1988 it sold 2.8 million copies and she spent more weeks on the singles chart than any other artist. Kylie went on to record three more studio albums with SAW scoring 15 successive top 10 hits including; \"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\", \"Hand on Your Heart\", \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\", \"Tears on My Pillow\", \"Better the Devil You Know\", \"Shocked\" among many others.", "In 2005 Stock briefly teamed up with Pete Waterman to write and produce a single for 'The Sheilas' of the Sheila's Wheels car insurance brand and again in 2010, collaborating on the UK's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, \"That Sounds Good To Me\"."]}, {"page": "Sonia (singer)", "response": ["Sonia was signed to Chrysalis Records after badgering Pete Waterman to listen to her sing outside his recording studio in Liverpool.

Accessed: 4 May 2008.", "In January 1984, Mike Stock and Matt Aitken called Pete Waterman asking for a meeting. Mike and Matt turned up with a song they had written and produced called \"The Upstroke\", a hi-NRG female version of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's \"Relax\". Pete Waterman was impressed and offered to form a partnership with Mike and Matt. \"The Upstroke\", performed by female duo Agents Aren't Aeroplanes, was the very first Stock Aitken Waterman record. It wasn't a chart hit, but it was a club hit and was championed by Radio 1's John Peel. Their initial style was in creating hi-NRG dance music with \"You Think You're a Man\" by Divine (UK No. 16 in July 1984) and \"Whatever I Do\" by Hazell Dean (UK No. 4 in July 1984). This period saw a rapid refining of the core production team and their roles, with a fourth collaborator, Pete Ware, who was co-credited on the team's earliest records, leaving after Stock and Aitken objected to him taking a side gig touring with Dean.", "The production trio achieved their first UK No. 1 single in March 1985 with \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" by Dead or Alive. Although a massive commercial success, the record set the scene for SAW's often fractious creative relationship with those bands and artists who demanded creative involvement in their records. Engineer Phil Harding, who mixed the track, said tensions were running so high between the band members and producers Stock and Aitken during mixing, that it almost escalated to violence. Stock has disputed the seriousness of studio tensions, alleging that singer Pete Burns, Harding and Waterman have all \"exaggerated\" what happened in their recounting of events. Despite the enormous success of the single, Pete Waterman has stated in interviews that the trio were still in dire financial straits at the time.", "The tendency toward interchanging artists and repertoire was well established when Rick Astley's breakout album Whenever You Need Somebody got its name and title track from a minor hit the trio had produced a year earlier for O'Chi Brown. Evidently they thought the song still had some mileage, and it was even issued with an exact replica of O'chi's club mix for the Rick Astley club mix. Similarly, many of their songs were tried out and recorded by multiple artists; Mel and Kim, Pepsi and Shirlie and Sinitta all recorded the song \"Who's Gonna Catch You\", both Kylie Minogue and Mandy Smith recorded \"Got To Be Certain\", whilst Mel and Kim, Carol Hitchcock and Hazell Dean all laid down vocals for \"More Than Words Can Say\". Their prodigious, production line-like output and similar song structures led to them being referred to as the \"hit factory\" (not to be confused with the record label of the same name or the New York City recording studio The Hit Factory) and attracted criticism from many quarters, including the Guardian newspaper who unflatteringly dubbed the team, \"Schlock, Aimless and Waterdown\". However, Pete Waterman defended their style by comparing it to the output of Motown in the 1960s.", "PWL was championed by the music papers for their fresh sound and seemingly underground aesthetic, but not for long. They incurred bad reviews from the British music press establishment when they strong-armed the group M/A/R/R/S into a legal settlement; M/A/R/R/S had taken from SAW's own recording, \"Roadblock\", and used in their surprise hit \"Pump Up the Volume\". Pete Waterman wrote an open letter to the music press calling such things \"wholesale theft\". The press fired back that Waterman was currently using the bassline of Colonel Abrams's \"Trapped\" in Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\". Indeed, \"Roadblock\" itself could be described as inspired by the classic Average White Band hit \"Pick Up the Pieces\". Waterman's production company later lifted the entire basic rhythm arrangement from \"Pump Up the Volume\" (complete with the chorus) in a remix for a Sybil record (wisely titled the \"Red Ink Remix\"). As a result, relations between PWL and much of the UK's music underground were for a long time acrimonious. Waterman said it was a matter of principle rather than profit and promised to donate all royalties from the court case to charity.", "In 1989, SAW wrote and produced the highest-selling album of the year, Jason Donovan's Ten Good Reasons. Donovan had been Minogue's co-star in Neighbours, and his success for a time equalled hers. In 1988\u201389, SAW recorded three tracks with Judas Priest, a cover and their own tracks \"I Will Return\" and \"Runaround\". These tracks were never released, and are said to be in Judas Priest's possession.
