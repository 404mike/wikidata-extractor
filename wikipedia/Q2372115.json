It was written by Geoff McQueen, a writer who had genre experience after writing episodes of LWT's The Gentle Touch. Woodentop stood out from run of the mill police dramas of the time for a number of reasons including the use of hand-held cameras and natural lighting as well as the use of naturally sounding dialogue.   The show created a realistic portrayal of modern-day policing, and there was nothing like it on television at the time, a fact which was actively exploited by the programme's makers.http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/drama/cops.htm", "* Written by Geoff McQueen"]}, {"page": "Boon (TV series)", "response": ["The show's writers included Geoff McQueen, Kevin McNally, Bernard Strother, Anthony Minghella, Tony McHale, Kieran Prendiville and Veronica Henry.

It was written by Geoff McQueen, who had previously worked on LWT's The Gentle Touch. Woodentop followed Police Constable Jim Carver (Mark Wingett) on his first day, mentored by Woman Police Constable June Ackland (Trudie Goodwin). The production was seen as innovative for the use of natural lighting, hand-held cameras and an authentic portrayal of British policing. Woodentop was directed by Peter Cregeen, who had played a part in Z-Cars and Juliet Bravo.Thames Television commissioned 12 further episodes for transmission in 1984, which would relaunch under the title of The Bill.", "Early episodes of The Bill had a duration of fifty minutes, with thirty-five being produced over the first three series of The Bill. The fifty-minute episodes were broadcast post watershed, allowing the programme to include scenes of nudity, drug use, violence and swearing.The early series was considered to be realistic of how the police operated, with Geoff McQueen's focus on the mundane and the ordinary aspects of a police station, such as filling in forms and paperwork. The investigations displayed in each episode would vary from muggings and domestics, to bomb scares and armed robbery.", "In 1991, the Rover SD1 Area Car used in the title sequence was replaced by the new Ford Sierra, however the design remained the same; a siren splitting up scenes of various characters from the programme. In 1993, the continued success of the programme led to ITV changing from two 30-minute episodes a week to three. In 1994, the show celebrated its 10th anniversary in October. The special anniversary episodes that week followed Detective Inspector Sally Johnson in court charged with manslaughter after a drug user had died during a police raid. In July that year, series creator and writer Geoff McQueen, died at the age of 46.", "After Handford's debut as producer debut in January 1998, the original foundations of Geoff McQueen's writing was relaxed as he opted for a mix of police drama and exploring the private lives of the cast, but still remained that an incident would not be seen without a member of cast involved - sticking to McQueen's original mantra of the viewer \"doesn't go home with the characters\". The old title sequences were entirely removed, in favour of displaying things that are seen to be associated with policing, such as reflective jackets, a suspect being interviewed, and a map in the CAD room. The theme tune was also revamped, with a change from the irregular time signature. A major off-screen tragedy marred Handford's debut year on the series when actor Kevin Lloyd died on May 2, mere days after he was dismissed after ten years in the role of DC Tosh Lines for showing up to work drunk and for not memorising his lines. In August 1998, The Bill returned to its original format of hour-long episodes, airing twice weekly. Serialisation was also brought in sporadically with some plots running the course of three or four episodes alongside stadalone, one-episode plots; they included experienced PC Tony Stamp accidentally killing a pedestrian with the Area Car and PC Eddie Santini attempting to rape WPC Rosie Fox before bullying her out of Sun Hill."]}, {"page": "The Bill", "response": ["The Bill was originally conceived by Geoff McQueen in 1983, then a new television writer, as a one-off drama.
