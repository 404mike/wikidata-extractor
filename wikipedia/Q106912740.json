The murder went undetected for ten days and became a sensation when discovered in the hot summer of 1895 in the East End of London. The event became known as the Plaistow Horror. A classic example of a \"bad seed\" Robert seems to have had no moral compass, and was involved in many financial tricks, before turning to murder. Always seeking attention he would be diagnosed ADD in modern terminology. He escaped the hangman's noose due to his age.\nRobert was one of the only male prisoners in Holloway Prison and the youngest ever inmate of Broadmoor. Despite his horrific crimes he was released and lived a long and productive life in Australia thereafter, being considered rehabilitated.", "link_mentions": {}}}
