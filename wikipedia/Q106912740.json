The murder went undetected for ten days and became a sensation when discovered in the hot summer of 1895 in the East End of London. The event became known as the Plaistow Horror. A classic example of a \"bad seed\" Robert seems to have had no moral compass, and was involved in many financial tricks, before turning to murder. Always seeking attention he would be diagnosed ADD in modern terminology. He escaped the hangman's noose due to his age.\nRobert was one of the only male prisoners in Holloway Prison and the youngest ever inmate of Broadmoor. Despite his horrific crimes he was released and lived a long and productive life in Australia thereafter, being considered rehabilitated.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Horace Avory", "response": ["Famous cases in which he appeared to include the trials of Adoph Beck, Sir Roger Casement, Oscar Wilde (as prosecuting counsel), Jean-Pierre Vaquier,O'Donnell (1935) p.190 Patrick Mahon, Robert Coombeshttps://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?div=t18950909-720 and Clarence Hatry.

It is made of Portland stone, and is 9\u00a0ft. high, 6\u00a0ft. 6in. long, and 3\u00a0ft. 6in. wide. On the top slab is the representation of a wherry bottom upwards, over which is thrown a coat and badge, and by the side are broken sculls. This slab is supported by four figures cut out of the solid stonework, one at each corner. The figures represent four champions of the Thames : first, Robert Coombes,  in his rowing costume, holding a broken scull; second, Tom Cole, of Chelsea, wearing Doggett's Coat and Badge, with the peculiar pineapple button ; third, James Messenger, of Kingston, with the coat and badge of the Thames National Regatta; fourth, Harry Kelley, of Putney, an athlete in rowing costume.
