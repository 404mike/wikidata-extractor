Trained in group analysis and working as child psychiatrist and family therapist, he employed group-analytic principles in that therapeutic modality.

This work was influential, especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time, and the influence of social and contextual factors in children's mental health, in their subsequent re-evaluation of the original cohort of children.
