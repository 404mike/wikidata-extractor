Why would an engraving be titled \"sold by\"?  Does it mean Richard G was the engraver?  That's what the ONDB says \"sold by\" means.  The engraving can be see on the National Portrait Gallery webpages.  Another Gammon in the story is Leonard Gammon whose engraving by William Faithorne appears on the National Portrait Gallery webpages.  Leonard Gammon possibly also a relation of James.  Leonard Gammon was the Clerk of the Works at Greenwich.  Leonard's father was almost certainly Richard Gammon who was married to Elizabeth Jones, kinswoman of Inigo Jones.  The Richard Gammon of the \"sold by\" reference is probably a younger brother of Leonard.
