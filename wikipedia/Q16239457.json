He is best known for his 1938 book Cronan nan Tonn (The Croon of the Sea). The Royal National M\u00f2d has an annual prize, the Duncan Johnston Trophy, named after him. Johnston, along with Charles MacNiven (1874\u20131944), Duncan MacNiven (1880\u20131955), and William Livingston (1808\u20131870), is one of the Islay Bards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Godred Crovan", "response": ["In the wake of Macpherson's publications, several examples of Manx folksongs appear to have first come to light. One particular piece, a Manx Gaelic song called Fin as Oshin, is the only example of  existing in Manx musical tradition.Broderick (2018) pp. 63, 73, 76; Broderick (1990) pp. 51\u201353. Surviving in several eighteenth-century manuscripts,Broderick (2018) pp. 63\u201366; \u00d3 Muircheartaigh (2016). Fin as Oshin tells a tale similar to other poems recounting the story of the burning of Finn's house.Broderick (2018) pp. 73\u201374, 80\u201381; Broderick (1990) pp. 53\u201354 n. 13, 54\u201358; Moore, AW (1891) pp. 10\u201312; Campbell (1872) pp. 175\u2013180. A central character in the song is a certain Gorree/Orree/Orree Beg, a hero who corresponds to Garadh/Garaidh in cognate tales. The spelling of this hero's name in Fin as Oshin suggests that he represents Godred himself, thereby giving the story a native slant.Broderick (2018) pp. 66\u201367, 74\u201375; \u00d3 Muircheartaigh (2016) pp. 104\u2013105, 121; Broderick (1990) pp. 53, 53\u201354 n. 13. Godred's place in this song probably accounts for its survival in local memory.Broderick (2018) pp. 75\u201376. In Vindication of the Celtic Character, the nineteenth-century Gaelic poet William Livingstone offered imaginative accounts of Viking incursions on Islay. One such tale, alleged by Livingstone to have been \"handed down from the Danish mythologists of those days\", concerns exploits of Godred in the island's Loch Indaal vicinity. Livingstone's versions of such local traditions appear to be the inspiration behind his epic Gaelic battle-poem Na Lochlannaich an Ile (\"The Norsemen in Islay\").Kidd (2006); Whyte (1991) pp. 175\u2013176; Livingston (1882) pp. 1\u201337; Livingston (1850) pp. 147\u2013150. The Gaelic folk song Birlinn Ghoraidh Chr\u00f3bhain, sometimes called Birlinn Ghoraidh Chrobhain and Godred Crovan's Galley, was composed by Duncan Johnston, and released in part one of his 1938 book Cronan nan Tonn. Johnston's song describes the journey of Godred's royal birlinn from Mann to Islay, and commemorates the sea-power of the Crovan dynasty.McDonald (2007b) p. 53, 53 n. 62; Johnston (1997) p. 28."]}, {"page": "Duncan Johnston", "response": ["Duncan Johnston was born at 32 Heriot RowEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1847-8 in Edinburgh on 25 June 1847 the son of Henry Johnston, a surgeon in the Honourable East India Company.
