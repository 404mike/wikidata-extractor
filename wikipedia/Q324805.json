As President of the Selsdon Group, a free-market lobby within the Conservative Party, he was closely aligned with Margaret Thatcher, and became one of her Ministers of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1979. Responsible for the Falkland Islands, he tried to resolve the long-running sovereignty issue with Argentina, which detected Britain's reluctance to defend the territory, and later invaded it.\nAs Secretary of State for Transport, Ridley performed a key function in building up coal stocks in advance of the 1984\u201385 miners' strike, which helped the government to defeat the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). As Secretary of State for the Environment, Ridley opposed a low-cost housing development near his own property, earning him the title of \"NIMBY\" (\"Not in My Back Yard\"). He was also responsible for introducing the \"poll tax\" (formally known as the Community Charge), which was one of the main factors leading to Thatcher's resignation in 1990. He was created a life peer in 1992.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 17", "response": ["*  1929   \u2013 Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale, English lieutenant and politician, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (d. 1993)"]}, {"page": "March 4", "response": ["*  1993   \u2013 Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale, English lieutenant and politician, Secretary of State for the Environment (b. 1929)"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Ridley", "response": ["* Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale (1929\u20131993), British politician"]}]}}
