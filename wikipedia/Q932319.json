Despite being able to select from a group of players which included Lions tourists Jason White, Tom Smith, Scott Murray, Gregor Townsend, Gordon Bulloch, Nathan Hines, Chris Cusiter, Mike Blair, Ross Ford and Simon Taylor - as well as experienced players like Jon Petrie and Stuart Grimes - Williams' team only won 17.65% of their matches. Scotland won just three games - against the Tier 2 nations Japan and Samoa in 2004, and against Italy in the 2005 Six Nations. Additionally, Williams controversially discarded Townsend - a celebrated figure in Scottish rugby, then aged only 30 - a week prior to the unveiling of his first national squad, despite an admission that his team lacked experienced centres."]}, {"page": "Chris Paterson", "response": ["Paterson was captain during the 2007 Six Nations Championship as Jason White was injured."]}, {"page": "List of Aberdonians", "response": ["*Jason White (born 1978), rugby union player (raised in Aberdeen)"]}, {"page": "ASM Clermont Auvergne", "response": ["*  Jason White"]}]}}
