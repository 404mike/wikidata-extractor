He currently serves as head coach of Major League Soccer club Minnesota United FC. As a player, he is best known for his six seasons at Everton, where he won two First Division titles and an FA Cup. As a manager, Heath initially worked in his native England before moving abroad to Orlando City, an expansion side in the American second division. Orlando City had the best start of any newly founded team in the history of American soccer, winning multiple honours before joining MLS in 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrian", "response": ["*Adrian Heath (born 1961), English football manager and former player", "*Adrian Heath (1920\u20131992), British painter", "*Adrian Heathfield, British writer and curator"]}, {"page": "Major League Soccer", "response": ["| Adrian Heath"]}, {"page": "Everton F.C.", "response": ["|2018||align=\"left\"|Adrian Heath||FW||1982\u201388||||226||71"]}, {"page": "Sheffield United F.C.", "response": ["The following years proved a turbulent time for United as they chased the ambition of Premiership football.  Experienced Howard Kendall was recruited as manager and undertook a complete rebuilding of the side but left in June 1997 to take over at Everton. Player-coach Nigel Spackman was promoted to replace Kendall but after initial promise he quit after only eight months citing boardroom interference. This was to become a recurring theme and replacement Steve Bruce would leave after only one season citing the same reasons. Adrian Heath then proved a disastrous appointment and lasted only six months before being sacked with United looking more likely to be relegated than promoted. The Blades then turned to experienced lower league manager Neil Warnock who managed to stave off relegation and began to rebuild the side on a meagre budget. Warnock proved a divisive figure with fans, but after a number of mid-table finishes he achieved promotion back to the Premiership in 2006. The side were relegated the following season, prompting the board not to renew Warnock's contract.", "Just like Adrian Heath, the appointment of Bryan Robson in 2007 proved an unpopular and unsuccessful one and he was sacked after less than a year following poor results and intense fan pressure. Former assistant manager Kevin Blackwell was appointed as Robson's replacement but despite reaching the play-off finals in his first full season the team was obviously in decline and he was sacked after only two games of the 2010\u201311 season.  Worse was to come however as player-coach Gary Speed was briefly promoted to manager but left after only a few months to take over the Welsh national side. Micky Adams then became the third full-time manager of the season, and oversaw a disastrous run of results which saw United relegated and Adams sacked after only six months in charge."]}, {"page": "Peter Shilton", "response": ["Shilton left Forest for Southampton, where his former international teammates Keegan and Alan Ball were both playing.

The club had struggled under Adrian Heath, before finding an upturn in results after Neil Warnock stepped into the hot-seat in December. He began the 2000\u201301 campaign in fine form, hitting a hat-trick past Lincoln City in a 6\u20131 win in the League Cup.

Savarese's club defeated Indy Eleven on penalty kicks in the 2016 NASL Championship Final, despite scheduling conflicts which forced the club to host the match at Belson Stadium in front of just 2,150 fans. Following the 2016 season, Savarese emerged as a finalist for the head coaching job with MLS expansion club Minnesota United FC. Talks with the new franchise fell apart when the Cosmos insisted on a transfer fee for releasing Savarese from the remainder of his contract, and the position went to Adrian Heath instead."]}, {"page": "List of Major League Soccer coaches", "response": ["|Adrian Heath ||  || align=center |  || Minnesota United FC || November 29, 2016 || N/A", "| Adrian Heath ||  || Minnesota United FC || 2017 || present", "| Adrian Heath ||  || Orlando City || 2015 || 2016"]}]}}
