He was awarded a DCL by Oxford University in 1790.\nHe initially practised as a physician in the West Indies but switched to law and was made Attorney-General in Grenada in 1779. In 1784, he accompanied his lifelong friend George, Lord Macartney, whom he first met in the West Indies, to Madras to negotiate peace with Tipu Sultan, for which service Staunton was created a baronet of Ireland, of Cargins in the County of Galway on 31 October 1785.Staunton was elected in February 1787 a Fellow of the Royal Society.In 1793, Staunton was named Secretary to the British mission to the Chinese Imperial court.  This diplomatic and trade mission would be headed by Lord Macartney.  Although the Macartney Embassy returned to London without obtaining any concession from China, the mission could have been termed a success because it brought back detailed observations. Staunton was charged with producing the official account of the expedition after their return. \nIt was published 1797 under the title An Authentic Account of an Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China.\nThis multi-volume work was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney and from the papers of Sir Erasmus Gower, who was Commander of the expedition. Sir Joseph Banks, the President of the Royal Society, was responsible for selecting and arranging engraving of the illustrations in this official record.Staunton died at his London house, 17 Devonshire Street, on 14 January 1801 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a monument by Sir Francis Chantrey is erected to his memory. The baronetcy, his Irish estate at Clydagh, County Galway and his London home were all inherited by his only son, George Thomas Staunton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Staunton", "response": ["* Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet (1737\u20131801), diplomat and Orientalist"]}, {"page": "Sir George Staunton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Macartney Embassy", "response": ["* Second-in-command: Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet, accompanied by his 12-year-old son Sir George Staunton, 2nd Baronet"]}, {"page": "George Leonard Staunton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Sir George Leonard Staunton, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Sir George Leonard Staunton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Staunton, George Leonard", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Attorney General of Grenada", "response": ["* Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet 1779-1784"]}, {"page": "Johann Christian H\u00fcttner", "response": ["H\u00fcttner was born at Guben in Lusatia, Germany.

Nothing assuredly but the tortures of a maddening jealousy could have first suggested the idea of mutilating one sex, in order to render it an unsuspected guard upon the other ; and nothing less than the extreme abuse of unlimited authority, could effectuate so cruel and unnatural a purpose. Other motives, however, might have come in addition to give occasion to the continuance and multiplication of such beings. No longer belonging to either sex, held in horror and contempt by both, without the possibility of offspring, unendearing and unendeared, and like no brother; they may be supposed to be the more bound by the fictitious tie of servitude, and devoted and attached without reserve to the prince by whom they are employed. Menial servants in the beginning, and pretending to no importance, they are the ready and servile ministers to the potentate's private pleasures and amusement, and creep gradually into familiarity and favour. From thence, as the annals of China in numberless instances testify, they have sometimes passed into situations of power and authority, in which once placed, they revenged themselves, as if it were on mankind, for the wrongs they had suffered in ' their persons; and were often the causes of calamities ending almost in the ruin of the state. They had been driven, with a few exceptions, on several occasions, from . the court. Near six thousand of them were dismissed in the minority of Caung-shee, grandfather of Chen-lung; but they have been gradually increasing since that period, and hold at present most of the inferior offices at least in the palaces of Pekin and Yuen-min-yuen. The qualification for such offices, consists in that operation, which in a few parts of Europe, is performed for meliorating the voice, and disqualifies for being a parent. But to be entrusted with the care of the ladies of the court, or to be allowed to approach to their apartments, it is necessary to be what, without reference to colour, the Turks are said to have termed a black eunuch, which means, that all traces of sex should completely be erased. It may appear surprising to the English reader, that the operations for this purpose, however delicate in themselves, are performed, even upon Chinese of an adult age, with little accident or peril in respect to life. Such a fact is the more extraordinary, as the art of surgery is so little known in China, that not even letting blood by opening a vein is attempted there, and anatomy is not only unknown, but held in horror. It is, however, to be remarked, that the Chinese recover from all kinds of accidents more rapidly, and after fewer symptoms of any kind of danojer, than most people do in Europe. The constant and quick recovery from considerable and alarming wounds, has been observed likewise to take place among the natives of Hindostan. The European surgeons there, have often been surprised at the easy cure of sepoys in the English service, from accidents accounted extremely formidable. The clear and pure atmosphere of China and India, maybe indeed more favourable on such occasions, than the ccelum nebulis fadum of Tacitus's description of Great Britain. But the habits of life contribute no doubt, most to determine the nature of the constitution ; and its propensity to inflame and mortify in consequence, as it is technically expressed of any solution of continuity. The Chinese and Hindoos arc not generally prone to excesses of any kind. The Hindoos of the lowest and most numerous cast, are not restricted from eating any kind of meat, excepting beef; but they and the Chinese consume a much smaller proportion of animal food, and drink a much less quantity of spirituous and fermented liquors than the people, at least, of northern Europe.\""]}]}}
