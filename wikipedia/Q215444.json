In the very year the novel appeared, Broch confessed to 'a deep revulsion' from literature as such \u2013 'the domain of vanity and mendacity'. Written with a paradoxical, lyrical exuberance, it is the imaginary record of the poet\u2019s last day and his renunciation of poetry. He commands the manuscript of the Aeneid to be destroyed, not because it is incomplete or imperfect but because it is poetry and not 'knowledge'.  He even says his Georgics are useless, inferior to any expert treatise on agriculture.

The son of a north German merchant and a \"Southern\" mother (Consuelo) with artistic talents, Tonio inherited qualities from both sides of his family. As a child, he experiences conflicting feelings for the bourgeois people around him. He feels both superior to them in his insights and envious of their innocent vitality. This conflict continues into Tonio's adulthood, when he becomes a famous writer living in southern Germany. \"To be an artist,\" he comes to believe, \"one has to die to everyday life.\" These issues are only partially resolved when Tonio travels north to visit his hometown. While there, Tonio is mistaken for an escaped criminal, thereby reinforcing his inner suspicion that the artist must be an outsider relative to \"respectable\" society. As Erich Heller \u2013who knew Thomas Mann personally\u2013 observed, Tonio Kr\u00f6ger's theme is that of the \"artist as an exile from reality\" (with Goethe's Torquato Tasso (1790) and Grillparzer's Sappho (1818) for company).Erich Heller, The Disinherited Mind: Essays in Modern German Literature and Thought (Cambridge, Bowes & Bowes, 1952), p. 167. Cf. id., The Disinherited Mind (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books, 1961), p. 187. Yet it was also Erich Heller who, earlier, in his own youth, had diagnosed the main theme of Tonio Kr\u00f6ger to be the infatuation and entanglements of a passionate heart, destined to give shape to, intellectualize, its feelings in artistic terms.Erich Heller, Flucht aus dem zwanzigsten Jahrhundert: Eine kulturkritische Skizze (Vienna, Saturn-Verlag, 1938), p. 9.", "* Erich Heller, The Ironic German: A Study of Thomas Mann (London, Secker & Warburg, 1958), pp.\u00a068ff.
