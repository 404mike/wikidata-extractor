Egerton is widely considered to be one of the most important writers in the late nineteenth century New Woman movement, and a key exponent of early modernism in English-language literature. Born in Melbourne, Australia, she spent her childhood in Ireland, where she settled for a time, and considered herself to be \"intensely Irish\".Eleanor Fitzsimons, \"The Irish Identity of George Egerton\". Irish Women's Writing Network, 4 August 2017: \"In a letter to her cousin Ethel de Vere White, written in 1926, Egerton declared herself \u2018Intensely Irish\u2019\".", "George Egerton was born Mary Elizabeth Annie Dunne in Melbourne, Australia, in 1859, to a Welsh Protestant mother, Elizabeth (n\u00e9e George, also known as \"Isabella\"), and an Irish Catholic father, Captain John Joseph Dunne. The earliest years of her life were marked by migration between Australia, New Zealand and Chile, but most of her formative years were spent in and around Dublin, and Egerton was to refer to herself throughout her life as \"intensely Irish\".(Terence De Vere White, A Leaf from the Yellow Book, London: The Richards Press, 1958, p. 14 Raised Catholic, she was schooled for two years in Germany as a teenager. There, she demonstrated a talent for art and linguistics, but her ambitions to become an artist had to be shelved after the death of her mother when she was fourteen, at which time she became the caretaker for her younger siblings. She subsequently trained as a nurse.RIA/Cambridge Dictionary of Irish Biography (2009), Vol. III, p. 596.", "With Whyte-Melville, Egerton moved to Norway, where she lived for two years. This time spent in Norway was formative to her in terms of her intellectual growth and artistic development. While in Norway she immersed herself in the work of Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Ola Hansson, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Knut Hamsun. Her brief romantic connection to Hamsun served as the inspiration for her 1893 short story \"Now Spring Has Come\". Hamsun went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, and Egerton was the first to make Hamsun's work accessible to an English readership, with her translation of his first novel Hunger (Sult), published in 1899. A second marriage (in 1891) to the minor adventurer and author Egerton Tertius Clairmonte was the impetus for her first attempts at writing fiction \u2013 instigated by his penniless status and her desire to alleviate the boredom she felt upon her return to rural Ireland. She chose the pseudonym \"George Egerton\" as a tribute to both her mother and to Clairmonte.  Asked how to say her pen name, she told The Literary Digest it was pronounced edg'er-ton, adding \"This name is pronounced this way, as far as I know by all bearers of the name in England.\"Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936.", "Egerton's stylistic innovations and her often radical and feminist subject matterJusova, I. \"The New Woman and the Empire: Gender, Racial, and Colonial Issues\" in Sarah Grand, George Egerton, Elizabeth Robins, and Amy Levy. The Ohio State University Press, 2005. have ensured that her fiction continues to generate academic interest in America and Britain. Thomas Hardy acknowledged the influence of Egerton's work on his own, in particular on the construction of his \"New Woman\" character, Sue Bridehead, in Jude the Obscure, and Tina O'Toole has described New Woman writers in general, and Egerton in particular, as the \"missing link\" to the sexually transgressive work of later writers such as Kate O'Brien (novelist). Holbrook Jackson credited Egerton with the first mention of Friedrich Nietzsche in English literature (she refers to Nietzsche in Keynotes in 1893, three years before the first of Nietzsche's works was translated into English).Jackson suggests that \u2018[t]he earliest reference to Nietzsche in the literature of the period is to be found in George Egerton\u2019s Keynotes\u2019, Holbrook Jackson, The Eighteen Nineties, London: Grant Richards, 1922, p. 129) Her experimentation with form and content has also been described as anticipating the modernism of writers like Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Jean Rhys, and D. H. Lawrence, and her 1898 novel The Wheel of God, in particular, has been posited as a rudimentary template for James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and as a potential influence on segments of Ulysses.

This euphoria was not conducive to objective analysis, or to thoughtful appraisal of the expedition's strengths and weaknesses.
