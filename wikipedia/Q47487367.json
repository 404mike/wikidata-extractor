The pair then managed to crowdfund \u00a330,000, allowing them to compete in the 2017\u201318 Bobsleigh World Cup events. The money was needed to pay for travel between races for the pair of them, transport of the sled, race fees, insurance and possible medical expenses, among other things, and allowed them to concentrate on trying to win races.
