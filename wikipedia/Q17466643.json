He quickly usurped long-standing regular goalkeeper Gerry Cakebread and was the Bees' regular goalkeeper until losing his place to Gordon Phillips during an injury-affected 1966\u201367 season. He regained his place in the team early in the 1970\u201371 season, but on 27 November 1970, a dog ran onto the field of play during a match away to Colchester United and collided with Brodie, damaging ligaments in his knee. Though he managed five further appearances during the second half of the season, the injury ended Brodie's professional career. Brodie departed Griffin Park at the end of the 1970\u201371 season, after making 224 appearances during his eight years with the Bees.
