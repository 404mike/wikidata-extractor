Scarisbrick, Henry VIII (1968) pp. 500\u20131. He inherited seven small warships from his father, and added two dozen more by 1514.  In addition to those built in England, he bought up Italian and Hanseatic warships. By March 1513, he proudly watched his fleet sail down the Thames under command of Sir Edmund Howard. It was the most powerful naval force to date in English history: 24 ships led by the 1600 ton \"Henry Imperial\"; the fleet carried 5000 combat marines and 3000 sailors.  It forced the outnumbered French fleet back to its ports, took control of the English Channel, and blockaded Brest.  Henry was the first king to organize the navy as a permanent force, with a permanent administrative and logistical structure, funded by tax revenue and supervised by the new Navy Board.C. S. L.  Davies,  \"The Administration of the Royal Navy under Henry VIII: the origins of the Navy Board.\" English Historical Review 80.315 (1965): 268\u2013288. in JSTOR His personal attention was concentrated on land, where he founded the royal dockyards, planted trees for shipbuilding, enacted laws for inland navigation, guarded the coastline with fortifications, set up a school for navigation and designated the roles of officers and sailors.  He closely supervised the construction of all his warships and their guns, knowing their designs, speed, tonnage, armaments and battle tactics. He encouraged his naval architects, who perfected the Italian technique of mounting guns in the waist of the ship, thus lowering the center of gravity and making it a better platform. He supervised the smallest details and enjoyed nothing more than presiding over the launching of a new ship.A.F. Pollard, Henry VIII (1902) pp 50, 100-2. He drained his treasury on military and naval affairs, diverting the revenues from new taxes and the sales of monastery lands.N.A.M.
