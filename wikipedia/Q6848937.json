He made 111 and 83 in May against Oxford University, and 39 and 31 against Cambridge University; in the latter game he also took his last wicket, that of Mike Stevenson. These matches apart, 32 against Warwickshire was his highest score of the summer."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1950", "response": ["Guy Willatt joined Derbyshire as designated  captain but was hampered by injury and did not fill the role until the following season.
