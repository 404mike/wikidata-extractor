Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On 5 June 1810 William Cobbett stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by Thomas Curson Hansard. Cobbett was found \"guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence\". The court sentence read: \"The court do adjudge that you, William Cobbett pay to our Lord the King a fine of \u00a31000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years\u2014yourself in the sum of \u00a33000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of \u00a31000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid\". The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as \"vindictive\". The Court argued that Thomas Curson Hansard, who had \"seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all\" and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the King's Bench Prison.", "Cobbett's reports were printed by Thomas Curson Hansard from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the Parliamentary Debates and Parliamentary History, which then \"passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812\". Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates became Hansard Parliamentary Debates, \"abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard\". From 1829 the name \"Hansard\" appeared on the title page of each issue.::: Department of the Official Report (Hansard) \u2013 Story of Hansard :::  Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers.

They were introduced to European typography in 1788, when Richard Austin cut a new font for typefounder and publisher John Bell, which included three-quarter height lining figures. They were further developed by 19th-century type designers, and largely displaced text figures in some contexts, such as newspaper and advertising typography. During the period of transition from text figures to lining, a justification for the old system was that the height differences helped distinguish similar numbers, while a justification for lining figures was that they were clearer (being larger) and that they looked better by giving all page numbers the same height. Amusingly, as several later writers have noted, the printer Thomas Curson Hansard in his landmark textbook on printing Typographia describes the new fashion as 'preposterous', but the book was printed using lining figures and the modern typefaces he also criticised throughout."]}, {"page": "Luke Hansard", "response": ["Luke Hansard (5 July 1752 \u2013 29 October 1828) was an English printer.

The advantage of French-Clarendon type was that it allowed very large, eye-catching serifs while the letters remained narrow, suiting the desire of poster-makers for condensed but very bold type.

Baskerville was never particularly successful as a printer, being a printer of specialist and elite editions, something not helped by the erratic standard of editing in his books. Abroad, however, he was much admired (if not directly imitated, at least not his style of type design), notably by Pierre Simon Fournier, Giambattista Bodoni and Benjamin Franklin (who had started his career as a printer), who wrote him a letter praising his work. His work was later admired in England by Thomas Frognall Dibdin, who wrote that 'in his Italic letter...he stands unrivalled; such elegance, freedom and perfect symmetry being in vain to be looked for among the specimens of Aldus and Colinaeus...Baskerville was a truly original artist, he struck out a new method of printing in this country and may be considered as the founder of that luxuriant style of typography at present so generally prevails; and which seems to have attained perfection in the neatness of Whittingham, the elegance of Bulmer and the splendour of Bensley.\" Thomas Curson Hansard in 1825 seems to have had misgivings about his work, praising his achievement in some ways but also suggesting that he was a better printer than a type designer. On his death his widow Sarah eventually sold his material to a Paris literary society connected to Beaumarchais, placing them out of reach of British printing. A. F. Johnson however cautions that some perhaps over-patriotic British writers on type design have over-estimated Baskerville's influence on continental type design: \"there seems to be no trace of a Baskerville school outside Great Britain, except of course in the use of actual Baskerville types. Didot proceeded from the \"romains du roi\" and would have so proceeded if Baskerville had never printed.

By his failure he found himself seriously in Cobbett's debt, and he received little mercy. In 1803 he was confined in the Fleet at the suit of his creditor. At a later time Cobbett asserted and Wright denied that the committal was by mutual arrangement. At any rate, he was released in a few weeks on terms which made him Cobbett's hack and forced him to follow his master in 1804 in his change of politics.
