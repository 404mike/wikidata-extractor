He followed this up with a spectacular 30 goals the following season, including a hat-trick in a 3\u20134 defeat at Gillingham on 3 April 1915, making him the leading scorer in the Southern League."]}, {"page": "Henry Hamilton (footballer)", "response": ["Hamilton was immediately drafted into the first team as centre-forward, making his debut on 2 September 1911 at home to Millwall. He found the net fairly regularly during his one season at The Dell, scoring nine goals in 23 league appearances, thus becoming top-scorer for the 1911\u201312 season. He had problems settling in the south, however, and in March 1912 was suspended (along with Andrew Gibson) for a serious breach of club discipline, as a result of which he was placed on the transfer list. Following his departure Saints tried several players at centre forward including Cecil Christmas and Leonard Dawe before finally settling on Percy Prince."]}, {"page": "Len Andrews", "response": ["He started off well scoring eight goals in the first 17 games, before the goals dried up after Christmas 1912 and he finished the season with nine goals, one behind leading scorer Percy Prince. He was more consistent the following season, where he was now playing alongside Arthur Dominy; he scored twelve goals and missed only one league game. In the final pre-war season he contributed eleven goals of which eight were from penalties."]}, {"page": "Baven Penton", "response": ["Penton was born in Boscombe, Bournemouth in early 1890 and was a prolific marksman in his minor league days, scoring 60 in one season with Pokesdown and 26 in another for Boscombe.

Despite \"showing persistence and industry\", he struggled to reproduce the form he had at Brentford and after scoring only four goals in his first fourteen appearances, he was replaced by Percy Prince. Smith was recalled for a further five matches in December/January without managing to score, and lost his place again, this time to new signing, Arthur Hollins."]}, {"page": "Leonard Dawe", "response": ["In March 1912, he signed on amateur terms for Southampton of the Southern League, making his debut in a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle on 30 March.

However, due to the form of Bill Rawlings, Reader's opportunities in the side were limited \u2013 after only three league appearances, he left at the end of the season to focus on a teaching career, playing part-time for Harland and Wolff. The following month, the club signed outside-right Frank Wright from Hamstead Colliery, who made just one appearance (described by club historians as \"a poor showing\") before being released at the end of the season.
