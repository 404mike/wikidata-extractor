It was joined by several sitting members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly including Nationalists Ernest Blyth (Division of Lyons) William Dixon (Franklin), Edward Hobbs (Darwin), and independent Joshua Whitsitt (Darwin). At the 1922 state election Whitsitt stood down to transfer to federal politics and Dixon was defeated but Blyth led the party to gain three further members Richard Franks (Darwin, holding Whitsitt's seat), John Piggott (Franklin, taking Dixon's seat) and Albert Bendall (Wilmot). The overall result gave the Country Party the balance of power and they were able to force the replacement of Premier Walter Lee with John Hayes at the head of a coalition with Blyth as minister for lands and mines.Scott Bennett, 'Hayes, John Blyth (1868\u20131956)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1983, accessed online 31 May 2018."]}]}}
