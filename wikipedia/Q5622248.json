He was the son of Capt. Thomas Hugh Fleetwood Wilson of the 8th Hussars, who served as Lieutenant-Governor of Barbados, and Harriet Horatia Walker, daughter of Capt. Charles Montagu Walker of the Royal Naval.He was knighted in 1902, sworn in as a Privy Counsellor in 1914, and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1905, Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George 1908, and a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1911.In 1922, he published a memoir of his correspondence, Letters to Somebody: A Retrospect.He was a devoted reader of The Times, and wrote to the newspaper in 1932:\n\nYou cannot have many readers who have read The Times since 1855. I was born and passed my childhood in Florence and had to learn English. In that year, on my fifth birthday, my father called me into his study and told me that he would allow me to read one or two paragraphs of The Times to him. I felt highly honoured and when he died I continued the practice with my mother. The Times became a sort of family Bible with me. Since then, and up to now, I have rarely missed my daily reading of The Times. and I have made a practice of reading the back numbers which I may have been obliged to neglect for a time. I received and read The Times every day when I was in Egypt with the Financial mission, in 1873. I did the same when I was in South Africa with Kitchener during the Boer War, and in India The Times was stitched and ironed as was the practice in most clubs at that time. The six numbers came out to me regularly once a week and I never missed one; always reading them from the earliest number onwards. Since then I have never missed reading The Times daily.\nHe died in Stratford-upon-Avon, aged 90.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1910\u20131936)", "response": ["*Sir Guy Fleetwood Wilson (1850\u20131940)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["**Guy Fleetwood Wilson (1851\u20131940), British public servant"]}, {"page": "Guy Douglas Arthur Fleetwood-Wilson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Guy Fleetwood Wilson"]}, {"page": "The Bengal Club", "response": ["In British India, high-ranking Indians had been occasionally entertained at the Bengal Club. In 1910, following the Minto\u2013Morley Reforms, Sir Guy Fleetwood Wilson hosted an important dinner for rulers of princely states appointed to the Imperial Legislative Council. In 1934, Aga Khan III dined at the club as a guest of Sir Edward Benthall, a Member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly and former Governor of the Imperial Bank of India. In the early years of independent India, C. Rajagopalachari and Kailash Nath Katju were hosted for tea by the club, while Jawaharlal Nehru lunched with the club's president and committee members at their invitation. However, several anecdotes suggest that the Bengal Club otherwise practised racial discrimination towards Indians, even in postcolonial India.
