The 76th Division, along with the 48th Infantry and 77th Infantry divisions, was changed from a \"Lower Establishment\" unit to a \"Reserve Division\". On 20 December, the division was renamed the 76th Infantry (Reserve) Division, becoming a training formation in the process. These three divisions were supplemented by a fourth training formation, the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division, which was raised on 1 January 1943. The 76th Infantry (Reserve) Division was assigned to Eastern Command, and moved to Norwich. Soldiers who had completed their corps training, were sent to these training divisions. The soldiers were given five weeks of additional training at the section, platoon and company level, before undertaking a final three-day exercise. Troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations. Training was handled in this manner to relieve the \"Higher Establishment\" divisions from being milked for replacements for other units and to allow them to intensively train without the interruption of having to handle new recruits. For example, the 9th Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment provided recruits to other battalions within the regiment as well as the Royal Norfolk Regiment. During this period, command of the division changed several times. On 21 December 1943, Ozanne was replaced by Major-General Colin Callander who in turn was replaced by Major-General John Utterson-Kelso on 13 March 1944.", "|Major-General Colin Callander"]}, {"page": "Colin Callender (British Army officer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Callander"]}, {"page": "Dennis Ciclitira", "response": ["Ciclitira returned to Crete in September 1944, remaining there until the end of the war.
