From the 1960s the society began to broaden its interest beyond the Georgian period and its geographical locus. In the 1960s, the Scottish Georgian Society formed a West of Scotland Group based in Glasgow under the chairmanship of bookseller Robert Clow, who earlier with architect Geoffrey Jarvis and others had formed the influential New Glasgow Society. In 1984, the present AHSS name was adopted to suit. The Society's logo, a drawing of the Old Town House in Aberdeen, was adopted in the 1960s. In 2009, the society was reconstituted as a company with the status of a registered charity."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst", "response": ["* George Baillie-Hamilton, 12th Earl of Haddington"]}, {"page": "Baillie-Hamilton", "response": ["*George Baillie-Hamilton, 12th Earl of Haddington MC, TD (1894\u20131986), Scottish Peer from 1917 to 1986"]}, {"page": "John Baillie-Hamilton, 13th Earl of Haddington", "response": ["Baillie-Hamilton was born in December 1941, the son of George Baillie-Hamilton, 12th Earl of Haddington, and his wife Sarah n\u00e9e Cook (died 1995), born the younger of two children.
