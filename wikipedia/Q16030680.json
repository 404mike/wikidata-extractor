The preceding Prahran and St Kilda Advertiser was first published by John Hartley in 1857, and continued until at least 1861.  The Osment family owned the Telegraph until 1882, and again from 1895-1905.  Henry Osment was prominent in local affairs and on Prahran Council, serving as Mayor for 1888/89.", "Various sources confirm the paper as starting in 1860, with Howard Spensley sometimes identified as the first owner.  However, ratebook research shows that Spensley took over the printery office from John Hartley only in 1862, so it is possible that Hartley in fact started the Telegraph.  Alternatively, it is also possible that Spensley was publishing the Telegraph from another address from 1860-1861, but he has not as yet been noted in ratebooks or directories.  An obituary for Spensley published in the Telegraph (23 August 1902) referred to Spensley somewhat enigmatically as \"... practically the founder of this journal, being the first editor and proprietor\"."]}, {"page": "Electoral results for the district of Portland", "response": ["| Howard Spensley"]}, {"page": "Spensley", "response": ["* Howard Spensley (1834-1902), Australian lawyer and British Liberal politician."]}]}}
