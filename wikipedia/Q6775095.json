While at the club, the Reading supporters' trust had a newly discovered star in the \"Perseus\" constellation named after him. Here he struck a formidable partnership with Martin Butler, becoming one of the most feared combinations in the Football League. In his first season (2000\u201301), he scored 30 goals, including a goal in the play-off final against Walsall, a game which Reading went on to lose 3\u20132. The following season however, it was Cureton who scored the goal to get Reading promoted. He scored the equaliser against Brentford in the closing stages, with a deft flick to help it over the keeper, into the corner of the net."]}, {"page": "Nicky Forster", "response": ["Two years later he was on the move again, this time to Reading, where he spent six years at the club at a cost of \u00a3650,000 between 1999 and 2005. Forster receives part of the credit for salvaging Reading's 1999\u20132000 season, during which the club rose from Division Two's relegation zone at Christmas to a finish in the top ten under caretaker manager Alan Pardew. However, an injured Forster was unable to contribute to the club's good fortune the following season. However, he did return in time for the 2000\u201301 Division Two play-off semi final against Wigan Athletic. In the second leg with Wigan leading 1\u20130 on aggregate, Forster came on as a late substitute. He set up Martin Butler for the equaliser before winning a penalty; after Jamie Cureton's effort was saved, Forster scored from the rebound. Reading were to lose the final 3\u20132 after extra time to Walsall.

The Mariners struggled in the early part of the 2008\u201309 season and Buckley was dismissed as the club's manager. In stepped Mike Newell as his replacement, and despite Grimsby's ongoing poor luck in the League, Jarman soon found himself a first team regular, this was mainly down to the release of want-away striker Martin Butler and on-going fitness problems with Danny North. This enabled Nathan to hold down a regular place in the first team squad, partnering fellow youngster Peter Bore up front for several weeks. Nathan scored his first league goal for Grimsby in the club's 2\u20130 away win over his former club Bury. This was The Mariners first league victory of the season. Jarman continued to feature in the first team, but due to the arrivals of new strikers Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro, Adam Proudlock and Barry Conlon, Jarman found himself relegated back to the bench, before Newell moved him on to the right side of midfield, a position which had become his regular position in the first team during the run in of the 2008\u201309 season."]}, {"page": "John Taylor (footballer, born 1964)", "response": ["Taylor's playing career was resurrected at Cambridge. Playing with youngsters such as Trevor Benjamin, Martin Butler and Michael Kyd he was able to lend his experience and score some vital goals along the way.

Taylor was picked as first-choice striker in the early part of the 2008\u20132009 season alongside Martin Butler and Danny North. After the dismissal of Buckley in September 2008, Taylor would not feature for the rest of the season under new manager Mike Newell. On 14 May 2009, Newell told Taylor he was free to leave the club and on 19 May he left Grimsby by mutual consent. He had a trial with York City in July, playing as a second-half substitute in a pre-season friendly against Bradford City, although he was not offered a contract by the club."]}]}}
