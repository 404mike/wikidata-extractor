In politics he was never in perfect accord with his father, and his retirement from parliament was probably caused by his inability to accept the Repeal movement. During his parliamentary career he fought a duel with Lord William Arden, 2nd Baron Alvanley, a captain in the British Army, at Chalk Farm, on 4 May 1835. A challenge had been sent by Alvanley to O'Connell's father, who, in accordance with a vow he had made after shooting D'Esterre, declined the meeting. Morgan thereupon took up the challenge. Two shots each were exchanged, but no one was hurt. He afterwards, in December 1835, received a challenge from Benjamin Disraeli, in consequence of an attack made on Disraeli by Morgan's father. Morgan declined to meet Disraeli."]}, {"page": "Underbank Hall", "response": ["Underbank Hall is a 16th-century town house in the centre of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England ().

Later that year Davies and Hobhouse travelled to the Villa Diodati to visit Byron, and on the way saw Brummell in Calais. Brummell's inner circle, to which Davies belonged, included William Arden, 2nd Baron Alvanley, who stepped into his shoes as the ton's leading influence. Others in that set were Joshua Allen, 6th Viscount Allen known as \"King\" Allen, Thomas Foley, 3rd Baron Foley, Sir Henry Mildmay and Lord Sidney Godolphin Osborne. In 1813 Davies challenged Lord Foley to a duel: the matter was smoothed over by Byron.
