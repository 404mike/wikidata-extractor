Starting in 1938, Frost worked as an assistant inspector studying trout in the River Liffey for the Fisheries Branch in Dublin. That same year, she became a research scientist for the Freshwater Biological Association. In 1945, the quality of her published work encouraged Liverpool University to grant Frost her Doctor of Science. Frost co-wrote The Trout, published in 1967 as part of the New Naturalist series, with Margaret E. Brown. The majority of the book was written in the late 1950s, but it took Frost and Brown, in all, 21 years to compile. Frost was also a member of the Council of Salmon and Trout Association, which facilitated her travel to central Africa where she studied eels. Frost remained a staff member at the Freshwater Biological Association until she died in 1979. She bequeathed most of her assets to the Freshwater Biological Association, which then created a scholarship to fund postgraduate students studying freshwater biology."]}]}}
