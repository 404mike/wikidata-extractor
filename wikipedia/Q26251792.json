He signed Ben Stevenson on a permanent basis in January. However the promotion campaign faltered, and despite beating champions Lincoln City on the final day, Colchester ended in eighth-place, a point outside the play-offs.

However, following Barnes' arrival, Chris Lewington was allowed to leave the club by mutual consent on 3 September after making only two appearances for the club. On 10 September, Colchester brought in forward Marvin Sordell on a contract until the end of the season after his release from Burnley earlier in the month. Sordell's signing was followed up by the loan arrival of Preston North End goalkeeper Jamie Jones on 11 September who joined for 93 days. Colchester's first league match for September followed on 12 September, with both new signings starting. The game was tipped to the U's advantage after 16 minutes when Chesterfield had Drew Talbot sent off, but it was Colchester who were first to concede with defender Daniel Jones putting the home side ahead with a free kick on 22 minutes. The U's responded with Gavin Massey's first goal of the season on 29 minutes, where the scores remained until half-time. In the second half, Colchester fell behind once again when Lee Novak scored from close range, before falling further behind on 74 minutes through captain Sam Morsy. The deficit was reduced two minutes later, with George Moncur scoring his second goal of the season. The game was levelled in added time when Chesterfield defender Charlie Raglan put the ball into his own net to draw the game 3\u20133.", "Colchester ended the campaign in defeat against Rochdale on 8 May. Caretaker manager Steve Ball had named Dillon Barnes in the first-team as goalkeeper, which would have been his professional debut following Elliot Parish's injury the previous weekend. However, Barnes was caught up in traffic, and James Bransgrove stepped in to instead make his professional bow. The U's were behind after 18-minutes when Nathaniel Mendez-Laing scored. Joe Edwards levelled the scores eight-minutes after the interval but had to go off injured after 64-minutes. His replacement, Cameron James, became the second player of the day to make his professional debut. Five minutes later, Rochdale scored the winner from Calvin Andrew to end Colchester's miserable season in yet another defeat.", "| Dillon Barnes", "| Dillon Barnes"]}]}}
