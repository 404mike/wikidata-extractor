He was best known for his many paintings of the Crucifixion, one of which hangs behind the altar in the chapter house of Liverpool Cathedral, Italian landscapes, and portraits (mainly of black men, or of dogs). His simple style with bright, childlike colours defied description, and was compared to the Scottish Colourists, primitivists or naive artists, although Brian Sewell dismissed him as \"a painter of too considered trifles\".His career-long fascination with the crucifixion was triggered by a visit to see Salvador Dal\u00ed's Christ of St John of the Cross in 1951 after it was acquired by the Kelvingrove Gallery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Andrews (artist)", "response": ["Michael Andrews was born in Norwich, England, the second child of Thomas Victor Andrews and his wife Gertrude Emma Green.

Strictly speaking all the Academicians are equal,\" he continued, \"But it's an open secret that some are more equal than others: Tracey Emin, Norman Foster, Zaha Hadid, David Hockney, Gary Hume, Anish Kapoor, Tom Phillips, Richard Rogers, the 'Angel of the North man'.\" In an interview on BBC Omnibus in 1997 he questioned the significance of the artist John Ward, a Royal Academician, and was felt to have ridiculed an elderly Victor Pasmore.

In 2004, Rosenthal was nearly sacked by Lawton Fitt, an ex-Goldmann Sachs banker who took the role of the Royal Academy's Secretary. \"Fitt and two others sent me a fax saying my services were no longer required and I should find a solicitor,\" Rosenthal has said. \"I did: Cherie Blair.
