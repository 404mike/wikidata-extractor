The Arab representatives submitted a statement from Sir Michael McDonnell to the committee that said whatever meaning McMahon had intended was of no legal consequence because it was his actual statements that constituted the pledge from His Majesty's Government. The Arab representatives also said McMahon had been acting as an intermediary for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Grey. Speaking in the House of Lords on 27 March 1923, Lord Grey said he had serious doubts about the validity of the Churchill White Paper's interpretation of the pledges he, as Foreign Secretary, had caused to be given to the Sharif Hussein in 1915. The Arab representatives suggested  a search for evidence in the files of the Foreign Office might clarify the Secretary of State's intentions."]}, {"page": "1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine", "response": ["The main form of collective punishment employed by the British forces was destruction of property. Sometimes entire villages were reduced to rubble, as happened to Mi'ar in October 1938; more often several prominent houses were blown up and others were trashed inside. The biggest single act of destruction occurred in Jaffa on 16 June 1936, when large gelignite charges were used to cut long pathways through the old city, destroying 220\u2013240 buildings and rendering up to 6,000 Arabs homeless.Scathing criticism for this action from Palestine Chief Justice Sir Michael McDonnell was not well received by the administration and the judge was soon removed from the country. Villages were also frequently punished by fines and confiscation of livestock. The British even used sea mines from the battleship HMS Malaya to destroy houses."]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Film", "response": ["| The Usual Suspects || Bryan Singer || Michael McDonnell ||  United States"]}, {"page": "MacDonnell (surname)", "response": ["* Michael McDonnell (contemporary), American trial lawyer, radio commentator, and professor of law"]}, {"page": "Norman Bentwich", "response": ["Bentwich played a major role in the development of Palestinian law. According to Likhovski, he \"concentrated his efforts on providing Palestine with a set of modern commercial laws that he believed would facilitate economic development and thus attract more Jewish immigration.\" Bentwich's perceived Zionist bias made him increasingly unpopular with Palestinian Arabs, who conducted demonstrations and other protests against his presence in the administration. Some British officials, including the Colonial Office and the Chief Justice of Palestine Michael McDonnell, saw him as a liability and agitated for his dismissal. In 1929 he was barred from representing the government at the Shaw Commission into the August riots. In late 1930 he went on leave to England, where he unsuccessfully sought to gain support for his continued role in Palestine. He was offered senior judicial positions in Mauritius and Cyprus, but turned them down. In August 1931 his appointment as Attorney-General was terminated by the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, who cited \"the peculiar racial and political conditions of Palestine, and the difficulties with which the Administration has in consequence to bear.\""]}, {"page": "Margaret Barber", "response": ["Unable to continue her charitable work, Barber took up writing under the pseudonym \"Michael Fairless\", the \"Michael\" inspired by her childhood friend Michael McDonnell (1882\u20131956), subsequently chief justice of the British Mandate of Palestine.

In June, British bombers dropped boxes of leaflets in Arabic requesting the inhabitants to evacuate that same day. On June 16, British Royal Engineers blew up from 220 to 240 Arab homes from east to west, leaving an open strip that cut through the heart of the city from end to end, leaving 6,000 Jaffa Palestinians destitute.Matthew Hughes, 'The Banality of Brutality: British Armed Forces and the Repression of the Arab Revolt in Palestine, 1936 \u2013 39', English Historical Review Vol. CXXIV No. 507 pp.323-354 pp.322.323. On the evening of 17 June 1936, 1500 British soldiers entered Jaffa and a British warship sealed off escape routes by sea. On 29 June, security forces implemented another stage of the plan, carving a swath from north to south. The mandatory authorities claimed the operation was part of a \"facelift\" of the old city. Local Arab papers could only employ sarcasm in describing what had happened, speaking of the operation as one in which the British forces beautified the city by using boxes of dynamite. In June, 1936 the Palestine Chief Justice at the time,   Sir Michael McDonnell, found in favour of the Jaffa Arab petitioners and, upholding the existing laws regarding demolitions, ruled against the Army's destruction of the Arab old city.
