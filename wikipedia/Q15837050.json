He is credited as the principal editor on seven feature films, and as the sound editor on another four. He worked with the director David Lean on four films that spanned Savage's entire career. Lean has been noted as possibly \"the best British film director ever\", and was himself a masterful editor. Savage started his career as an assistant editor on Lean's Hobson's Choice (1954). Savage was Anne V. Coates' first assistant editor for Lean's Lawrence of Arabia (1962). He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for Lean's 1965 film Doctor Zhivago, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing for Lean's 1970 film Ryan's Daughter. Savage died of leukemia while editing the film Lady Caroline Lamb (1972). That film is the only one directed by Robert Bolt, a playwright and screenwriter who had worked on several films directed by Lean.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Film Editing", "response": ["| Norman Savage"]}, {"page": "Doctor Zhivago (film)", "response": ["| Norman Savage"]}, {"page": "Ryan's Daughter", "response": ["| Norman Savage"]}, {"page": "38th Academy Awards", "response": ["** Doctor Zhivago\u00a0\u2013 Norman Savage"]}, {"page": "Savage (surname)", "response": ["*Norman Savage, British film editor"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Editing", "response": ["| Ryan's Daughter || Norman Savage"]}, {"page": "24th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Ryan's Daughter \u2013 Norman Savage"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["|Norman Savage"]}, {"page": "List of European Academy Award winners and nominees", "response": ["| Norman Savage"]}]}}
