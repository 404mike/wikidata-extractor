He was also a Scottish Unionist MP.\nNicknamed \"Hunter-Bunter\", Hunter-Weston has been seen as a classic example of a \"donkey\" general; he was described by his superior Sir Douglas Haig as a \"rank amateur\", and has been referred to by one modern writer as \"one of the Great War's spectacular incompetents\". However, another historian writes that although his poor performance at the battles of Krithia earned his reputation \"as one of the most brutal and incompetent commanders of the First World War\" \"in his later battles (at Gallipoli) he seemed to hit upon a formula for success ...(but) these small achievements were largely forgotten\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
