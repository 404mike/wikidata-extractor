However, another historian writes that although his poor performance at the battles of Krithia earned his reputation \"as one of the most brutal and incompetent commanders of the First World War\" \"in his later battles (at Gallipoli) he seemed to hit upon a formula for success ...(but) these small achievements were largely forgotten\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1940", "response": ["* March 18 \u2013 Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston, British army general (b. 1864)"]}, {"page": "Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig", "response": ["Australian historian Les Carlyon wrote that while Haig was slow to adapt to the correct use of artillery in sufficient quantities to support infantry attacks and was generally sceptical that the science of such doctrine had much place in military theory, he was fully supportive of excellent corps and field commanders such as Herbert Plumer, Arthur Currie and John Monash, who seem to best grasp and exercise these concepts, especially later in the war.
