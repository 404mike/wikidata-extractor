Clive was prominently involved with the See Hear Christmas and pantomime specials written by Terry Ruane and the late Dorothy Miles, two deaf people with strong backgrounds in Theatre.  By the late 1980s the show was focussed on the important issues and concerns of members of the Deaf community. As the show's popularity grew more Deaf staff were recruited to work on the show, both behind the scenes as well as in front of the camera. As the show neared its 10th anniversary, the BBC, along with other Deaf organisations felt that it needed a change to keep it fresh."]}, {"page": "You and Me (British TV series)", "response": ["*Clive Mason also joined the cast for programmes relevant to the deaf community."]}, {"page": "List of longest-running British television presenters", "response": ["| Clive Mason"]}]}}
