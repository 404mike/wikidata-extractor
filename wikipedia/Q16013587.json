Butler believed that historians could make a beneficial contribution to the formation of foreign policy, and he wrote extensively, especially on German and Russian issues.

In 1941, the British diplomat Robert Vansittart published The Black Record: Germans Past And Present, according to which Nazism was only the latest manifestation of what Vansittart argued were the exclusively German traits of aggressiveness and brutality. Other books with a thesis similar to Vansittart's were Rohan Butler's The Roots of National Socialism (1941) and William Montgomery McGovern's From Luther to Hitler: The History of Nazi-Fascist Philosophy (1946).Kershaw 2000:8"]}, {"page": "Religious views of Adolf Hitler", "response": ["The seminal work on Ariosophy, The Occult Roots of Nazism by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, devotes its last chapter the topic of Ariosophy and Adolf Hitler.

As noted in the foreword of The Occult Roots of Nazism by Rohan Butler, Goodrick-Clarke is more cautious in assessing the influence of Lanz von Liebenfels on Hitler than Joachim Fest in his biography of Hitler."]}, {"page": "Harold Butler (civil servant)", "response": ["He was the father of the civil servant and historian Rohan Butler."]}]}}
