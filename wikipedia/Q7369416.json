He is best known for producing light comedies such as Pillow Talk (1959), and the glamorous melodramas Magnificent Obsession (1954), Imitation of Life (1959), and Back Street (1961).", "During World War II, he worked in United States Army Intelligence. After his Army service, he returned to his job as a drama teacher. He eventually moved to Los Angeles after his students sent his photo to Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures passed on signing him to a contract and he subsequently signed with Columbia Pictures. It was at Columbia that a casting agent changed his name from \"Martin Fuss\" to \"Ross Hunter\".", "Hunter hit big in 1959 with Imitation of Life and Pillow Talk. Imitation of Life was a remake of the 1934 film directed by Sirk, with Lana Turner, Dee and Rock Hudson look-alike John Gavin. It was the fourth-most successful film during 1959 in the US, and went on to earn theatrical rentals of $6.4 million. The film was bettered in popularity by the romantic comedy Pillow Talk, starring Doris Day and Rock Hudson, which was released later in the year and went on to earn rentals of $7.6 million in the United States and Canada. Following the back-to-back successes of Tammy, Imitation of Life and Pillow Talk, he was the most successful producer at Universal. While \"Ross Hunter movies\" were a hit with audiences, his work was largely dismissed by critics. Hunter later said, \"I gave the public what they wanted: a chance to dream, to live vicariously, to see beautiful women, jewels, gorgeous clothes, melodrama.\""]}, {"page": "Grasmere Road Ground", "response": ["The first recorded match held on the ground came in 1988 when Hampshire Under-16s played Berkshire Under-16s.
