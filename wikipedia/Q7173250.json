Gash is an ex-policeman and, although much more likeable than Rylands (of the Brighton episodes) he does have very different ideas about the job from Marker. Although Marker would show interest in money if a large quantity of it appeared to be heading his way (such as \"Well\u2014There Was This Girl, You See ...\") he never considers raising his fees to provide himself with a more comfortable living standard. Gash is far more profit-motivated and also considers Marker's shabby appearance to be off-putting to potential clients. Yet again Marker decides he doesn't like working with a partner, and in the episode \"What's to Become of Us?\" (10 February 1975) Gash and he part ways peacefully and amicably.
