She made pointed observations of people in her circle and political figures. Although not intended for publication, an edition of her letters and journal, including entries from 1766 to 1774, was published in 1889 by a distant great-nephew.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1827 in literature", "response": ["*Lady Louisa Stuart \u2013 Memoir of Lady Mary Coke"]}, {"page": "Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz", "response": ["The King enjoyed country pursuits and riding and preferred to keep his family's residence as much as possible in the then rural towns of Kew and Richmond. He favoured an informal and relaxed domestic life, to the dismay of some courtiers more accustomed to displays of grandeur and strict protocol. Lady Mary Coke was indignant on hearing in July 1769 that the King, the Queen, her visiting brother Prince Ernest and Lady Effingham had gone for a walk through Richmond town by themselves without any servants. \"I am not satisfied in my mind about the propriety of a Queen walking in town unattended.\""]}, {"page": "Charlotte, Princess Royal", "response": ["Charlotte was officially designated as Princess Royal on 22 June 1789. After the birth of three sons in a row, her parents were delighted to have a Princess in the nursery. Like all of her siblings, Charlotte was inoculated, in her case, in December 1768 along with her brother William. As the eldest daughter of the monarch, Charlotte was assumed to be destined for an important marriage on the continent, and her education was considered to be of the utmost importance, beginning when she was only eighteen months old. Since French was the official language in every European court, the little Princess was given a Frenchwoman to be her tutor, in order that she should have no accent. Her memory was another of her early subjects. She was taught to recite little verses and stories, and as a result had an almost uncanny ability to recall detail for the rest of her life. Her early childhood, however, was not  only focused on scholarly pursuits. When she was almost three years old, she took part in her first tableau dressed like Columbine, where she danced with her seven-year-old brother George, Prince of Wales. She was not a naturally musical child and later abhorred such displays of children, declaring that they made children vain and self-important. This did not stop her parents from continuing to show her off. In late 1769, she and the Prince of Wales were once again displayed, this time to the public in a \"junior drawing room\" in St James's Palace. Charlotte was dressed in a Roman toga and lay on a sofa. Though this type of thing was common in German courts, it was considered vulgar in England, where in reaction a London mob drove a hearse into the Palace courtyard. Afterwards, the Prince of Wales told Lady Mary Coke that the whole event had made Charlotte \"terribly tired\". Wisely, the King and Queen decided to never repeat the experience.", "Though she was the eldest daughter, Charlotte was constantly compared to her sister Augusta Sophia, only two years younger than she. When Augusta was a month old, Lady Mary Coke called her \"the most beautiful baby I have ever seen\" while Charlotte was \"very plain\". Passing judgement once again three years later, Charlotte was now \"the most sensible agreeable child I ever saw, but in my opinion far from pretty\" while Augusta was still \"rather pretty\". Although the Princess Royal was never as beautiful as her younger sister, she did not share in Augusta's primary flaw: painful shyness. Charlotte also had a stammer that her attendant Mary Dacres tried to help her young charge manage. In 1770, the cluster of the three eldest princesses was completed with the birth of Princess Elizabeth, the seventh child. For the time being the family remained comparatively small (there were fifteen royal children in all), and Charlotte was fortunate in having parents who preferred spending time with their numerous children to spending all their time at court and took her education seriously. However, given the frequency with which children were being produced and the troubles that plagued George III's reign, Charlotte's childhood was not as utopian as her parents planned it to be."]}, {"page": "John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll", "response": ["Campbell married first, Mary Brown, daughter of John Brown and Ursula Duncombe, in 1701: they separated soon after the marriage and she died in 1717 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Little is understood to have survived of these alternations. Following Lady Mary, the house was occupied by a succession of tenants and was used for a time as a school. Aubrey House stood empty from 1819 to 1823, when it was purchased by developer and builder Joshua Flesher Hanson. The house was known as Notting Hill House by this time and was sold in 1827 by Hanson to Thomas Williams, a former coachmaker. Williams did not live there himself but let it as a boarding-school for young ladies from 1830 until 1854.
