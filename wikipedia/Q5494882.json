He also hit 32 (again) against Somerset the following year. (The remaining innings of his career was also single-digit, but not out.)\nHis bowling was similarly rarely decisive, but he did manage to take five of his eight career wickets in one innings when he claimed 5\u201371 against the Combined Services in 1922.\nCooper was born in Wetherby, Yorkshire, and died at the age of 70 in York.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Cooper (1888-1958)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1888)"]}, {"page": "Fred Cooper (Essex cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1888)"]}, {"page": "Fred Cooper (1888\u20131958)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1888)"]}, {"page": "Frederick Cooper", "response": ["Frederick or Fred Cooper may refer to:", "* Fred Cooper (bicyclist) (1852\u20131935), professional racing cyclist and bicycle manufacturer", "* Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1888) (1888\u20131958), Essex cricketer", "* Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1921) (1921\u20131986), Lancashire and Worcestershire cricketer", "* Fred Cooper (footballer) (1934\u20131972), professional footballer for West Ham United in the 1950s", "* Fred Cooper (illustrator), Society of Illustrators's Hall of Fame", "* Fred Cooper (boat designer), powerboat designer, early of the British Power Boat Company", "* Fred Cooper (rugby union), Welsh rugby union footballer of the 1890s for Yorkshire, Newport Athletic RFC, and Bradford FC"]}]}}
