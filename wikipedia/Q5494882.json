He also hit 32 (again) against Somerset the following year. (The remaining innings of his career was also single-digit, but not out.)\nHis bowling was similarly rarely decisive, but he did manage to take five of his eight career wickets in one innings when he claimed 5\u201371 against the Combined Services in 1922.\nCooper was born in Wetherby, Yorkshire, and died at the age of 70 in York.", "link_mentions": {}}}
