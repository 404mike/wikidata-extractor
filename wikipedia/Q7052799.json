That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with me for the rest of my life.

He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion.\" A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was \"his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice.\" The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of the Royal British Legion, who said, \"Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel.\""]}, {"page": "Craig Oliver (British journalist)", "response": ["On 28 May 2012, video footage was posted on the internet of Oliver reprimanding BBC News correspondent Norman Smith over the content of a story concerning a memo Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Jeremy Hunt sent to David Cameron about his thoughts on News Corporation's bid to take full control of BSkyB.
