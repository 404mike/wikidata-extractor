He spent part of 2004\u201305 on loan at Torquay United, before returning on loan at Oldham. His loan deal was made permanent in the summer for a \u00a350,000 fee, though he did not find success in the 2005\u201306 campaign. He spent the 2006\u201307 season on loan at Stockport County, and was voted the club's Player of the Season, after which he joined Stockport permanently, and was installed as club captain. Following a successful 2007\u201308 season, he joined Yeovil Town on loan in October 2008, having fallen out with the management at Stockport. He then joined Port Vale on a loan deal that was made permanent in January 2009. He was a key member of the first team in 2009\u201310 and 2010\u201311, and was also appointed as the club's reserve team manager for the 2011\u201312 season.

However, Paul Simpson's dismissal at Stockport County led to hopes of a return to the club for some County fans. Therefore, he was installed as the bookies favourite to become the next Port Vale manager, and also the bookie's favourite for the Stockport job. Gannon was confirmed as the manager of Port Vale on 6 January 2011, succeeding Micky Adams at the helm of the promotion chasing club, signing a contract that lasted until summer 2012. Saying that finishing outside of the top seven would be a failure, the Cheshire-based manager's first task after 'burying the hatchet' with Gareth Owen was to look for a new striker. Two weeks into his reign club captain Tommy Fraser left the club by mutual consent, as signs of what would be an unhappy relationship between club and manager quickly came to the surface.

Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe.

At twenty one years of age, and new to the club, his appointment came as a surprise to some, especially with more senior options in Sam Stockley, Marc Richards and Gareth Owen. However, Adams had faith in the young midfielder's vocal abilities and general leadership qualities. Putting in solid performances in Vale's unbeaten start to the season, he took to the field despite still suffering with an ankle injury. His first goal for the club seemed to come in a 4\u20130 home win over Grimsby Town on 5 September. However, after the match Marc Richards claimed the last touch and therefore took the credit for the goal. Fraser seemed to attract violence; on 25 August, Sheffield Wednesday's Francis Jeffers was sent off for head-butting Fraser, two weeks later Fraser and Aldershot Town captain John Halls almost came to blows before the match had even begun. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. He remained club captain and a first team regular though, striking up a midfield pairing with Anthony Griffith, who he also shared a house with. His performances as captain earned him public praise from assistant manager Geoff Horsfield, though the fans were critical at times of his inconsistency. He found himself the new focus of disgruntled supporters in early 2010, following Danny Glover's demotion to the reserves, and Marc Richards' rising goal tally. Fraser vowed to ignore the booing.

However, two months later he was transfer listed by new manager Micky Adams in August 2009 along with five other young players, having failed to impress in pre-season.

The pair made their debuts as substitutes in a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town at the Raymond McEnhill Stadium on 15 August 2009. After playing six games for Salisbury, Prosser's loan was extended for a further month on 8 September 2009.

In an eventful first half, Prosser scored his first professional goal with a close ranger header, before being sent off for two bookable offences.
