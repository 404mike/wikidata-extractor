The division took its place in the line on the right bank of the Piave river on 21 October, where the river runs in braided channels over one mile wide around an island, Grave di Papadopoli, which the Austrians used as a post in front of their main line.Sandilands p. 296 On the night of 25\u201326 October the 8th Yorkshire Regiment captured the northern part of the Grave, troops from the 7th division the southern part.Sandilands p. 307 The 68th and 69th brigades crossed the river on 27 October, and the planned 3000 yard advance was achieved in spite of the division's left flank being unsupported by the 58th Italian division which could not cross the river.Sandilands pp. 308\u2013312 The Austrians were, however, demoralised and were retreating behind a rear-guard. The next day the divisions advance of 3,500 yards was done by mid afternoon, during which Pte. Wilfred Wood of the 10th Northumberland Fusiliers won the V.C. for subduing a machine gun nest.Sandilands p. 318 Early on 28 October the river Monticano was crossed by the 69th brigade, and in securing the bridgehead (amongst other actions) Sgt William McNally of the 8th Yorkshire Regiment won the division's ninth and last V.C.. Stiffening resistance meant the day's advance was much less than expected.Sandilands pp. 319\u2013323 By the afternoon of 31 October the 69th brigade was in the town of Sacile some 15 miles from the Piave, where the last shot was fired by the division.Sandilands pp. 326\u2013328 The advance continued through the remains of Austrian columns attacked by aircraft, until the armistice signed on 3 November came into effect the next day, by which time the division was east of the river Tagliamento.Sandilands pp. 330\u2013332"]}, {"page": "Green Howards", "response": ["* Sergeant William McNally, VC MM and Bar (27 October\u00a0\u2013 29 October 1918)"]}, {"page": "McNally (surname)", "response": ["* William McNally (1894\u20131976), English soldier"]}, {"page": "McNally, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam McNally"]}]}}
