These were followed by four more players joining the club; Sam Bright, George Robinson, Peter O'Rourke and Jimmy Millar. Despite not having enough players to field a full side, four club representatives travelled to London by the end of May for a league management committee meeting, when the club was elected into the Second Division. Money was raised to fund the club, including at least \u00a32,000 from sponsors, a balance of \u00a3500 from Manningham FC and proceeds from a summer archery tournament. Bradford City also took over Manningham's Valley Parade ground for their home fixtures.", "|align=\"left\"|IR||align=\"left\"|Ben Prosser", "|May 1903||IR||Ben Prosser||Stoke||", "|1904||IR||Ben Prosser||Released||"]}]}}
