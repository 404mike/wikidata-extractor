During his short life he collected specimens of birds and eggs at various locations. He contributed notes to the Ibis journal as wells as the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. He also collaborated with Allan Octavian Hume. His collection of eggs and birds went into the Natural History Museum through the Tweeddale and Godman-Salvin collections.\nIn 1864 Beavan worked at Barrackpore and the winter of that year was spent in the Maunbhoom District, an area studied earlier by Samuel Tickell and Edward Blyth. His notes on this period were published in The Ibis (1865) entitled \"Notes on various Indian Birds\". While still in service he collected in the Andaman Islands and with additional information from Colonel Robert Christopher Tytler, wrote  \"The Avifauna of the Andaman Islands\" in the Ibis in 1867.\nBeavan was sent home once to Britain due to bad health, and on his second such trip, he died at sea.The species Pyrrhula erythaca, first collected by him, is sometimes called Beavan's Bullfinch (Also called Gray-headed Bullfinch).\nHis brother, Reginald, a lieutenant in the 22nd Punjab Native Infantry (Bengal Staff Corps where he was Lieutenant 1 Jan 1862, Captain 4 May 1872, Major 4 May 1880), was a keen sports hunter and took an interest in fishes.", "link_mentions": {}}}
