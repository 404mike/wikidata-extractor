The castle is made up of three \"wards\", or enclosures. The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle. Encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner ward, built during the reign of Richard I (1189\u20131199). Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under Edward I. Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London, the general layout has remained the same since Edward I completed his rebuild in 1285."]}, {"page": "Offa of Mercia", "response": ["There is evidence that Offa constructed a series of defensive burhs, or fortified towns; the locations are not generally agreed on but may include Bedford, Hereford, Northampton, Oxford and Stamford. In addition to their defensive uses, these burhs are thought to have been administrative centres, serving as regional markets and indicating a transformation of the Mercian economy away from its origins as a grouping of midland peoples. The burhs are forerunners of the defensive network successfully implemented by Alfred the Great a century later to deal with the Danish invasions.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p.\u00a03.Alan Vince, \"Market Centres and Towns in the Mercian Hegemony\", in Brown & Farr, Mercia, p.\u00a0192. However, Offa did not necessarily understand the economic changes that came with the burhs, so it is not safe to assume he envisioned all their benefits. In 749, \u00c6thelbald of Mercia had issued a charter that freed ecclesiastical lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges\u00a0\u2013 obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the trinoda necessitas.Campbell, The Anglo-Saxons, p. 100. Offa's Kentish charters show him laying these same burdens on the recipients of his grants there, and this may be a sign that the obligations were being spread outside Mercia.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0165.Gareth Williams, \"Military Institutions\", in Brown & Farr, Mercia, p.\u00a0297. These burdens were part of Offa's response to the threat of \"the pagan seaman\".Richard Abels, \"Trinoda Necessitas\", in Lapidge et al., \"Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England\", p.\u00a0456."]}, {"page": "Covent Garden", "response": ["During the Roman period, what is now the Strand \u2013 running along the southern boundary of the area that was to become Covent Garden \u2013 was part of the route to Silchester, known as \"Iter VII\" on the Antonine Itinerary. Excavations in 2006 at St Martin-in-the-Fields revealed a late Roman grave, suggesting the site had been sacred since at least 410\u00a0AD. The area to the north of the Strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century, but theories by Alan Vince and Martin Biddle that there had been an Anglo-Saxon settlement to the west of the old Roman town of Londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005. These revealed that a trading town, called Lundenwic, developed around 600\u00a0AD, stretching from Trafalgar Square to Aldwych, with Covent Garden at the centre. Alfred the Great gradually shifted the settlement into the old Roman town of Londinium from around 886\u00a0AD onwards, leaving no mark of the old town, and the site returned to fields."]}, {"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*Alan Vince (1952\u20132009) British; British ceramics"]}, {"page": "Cripplegate", "response": ["The origins of the gate's name are unclear.

However, the Department of Greater London Archaeology (DGLA) had discovered so-called Saxon farms in the area of Fleet Street, Covent Garden, and Westminster.  In the mid 1980s, Alan Vince and Martin Biddle independently came up with the theory that London had been re-established not in the City but a couple of miles to the west, centred on the area called Aldwych. This Middle Saxon settlement was known as Lundenwic. Lundenwic was subjected to increasing Viking attack in the 9th century and the population may have been forced to scatter. Around the year 886, Alfred the Great moved the Londoners back into the City of London and the shelter of the Roman defensive walls, which still stood. The Late Saxon reoccupation of the Roman town site was known as Lundenburgh."]}, {"page": "1952 in archaeology", "response": ["* March 30 - Alan Vince, British archaeologist (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "1994 in archaeology", "response": ["* John Schofield and Alan Vince \u2013 Medieval Towns (Leicester University Press)."]}, {"page": "Vince", "response": ["* Alan Vince (1952\u20132009), British archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Internet Archaeology", "response": ["The journal's first editor-in-chief (1996\u20131999) was Alan Vince.
