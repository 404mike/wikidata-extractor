There had clearly been some confusion about his candidacy and its joint support by local Liberal and Conservative Associations. Shortly before the election, a Captain Harry Houldsworth, looked set to contest the seat as a National Conservative but suddenly withdrew claiming he had misunderstood the local position and in the belief that Norie-Miller wished to continue.The Times,  25 October 1935 There was division in the Conservative ranks about whether to renew support for Norie-Miller. On 26 October, Norie-Miller did withdraw from the electoral race, citing medical reasons and the confusion of the position but the Unionists did not re-select Captain Houldsworth as their man, turning instead to Thomas Hunter, who was described in The Times newspaper as the Lord Provost of Perth and who could also rely on Liberal support. So no Liberal candidate of any stripe contested the 1935 general election in Perth which was won by the Unionists in a straight fight with Labour.The Times House of Commons, 1935; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2003, p150"]}, {"page": "1953 in Scotland", "response": ["* 19 March \u2013 Thomas Hunter, Unionist Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth (born 1872)"]}, {"page": "1872 in Scotland", "response": ["* 2 October \u2013 Thomas Hunter, Unionist Party MP for Perth (1935\u201345) (died 1953)"]}, {"page": "1944 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Thomas Hunter, Esq., J.P., M.P., Member of Parliament for Perth since November, 1935.
