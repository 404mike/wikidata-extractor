He has also produced limited edition prints. He was a friend of the conservationist and fellow painter Peter Scott, with whom he travelled to Antarctica. Like Scott, he went to Oundle School. He was also a presenter on the BBC children's television programme Animal Magic and of the Children's ITV series Animals in Action, produced by Anglia Television using footage from its Survival series.\nA retrospective exhibition of his \"Polar Art\", depicting creatures and scenery from both the Arctic and Antarctic was open at the Scott Polar Research Institute in May and June 2007.\nShackleton was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to the conservation of wildlife.He died peacefully on 17 April 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Animal Magic (TV series)", "response": ["Morris' co-presenters over the years were Gerald Durrell, Tony Soper, Keith Shackleton, Roger Tabor, Sheila Young, David Taylor and Terry Nutkins. When Nutkins joined the show in the early 1980s, the producers tried to update it, using new video effects technology. This allowed them to do such things as \"shrink\" the presenters to allow them to see life from an ant's viewpoint, or to swim in a riverbed for example. Joe Henson and Desmond Morris also appeared on the show. Dotty the ring-tailed lemur appeared as a regular guest for eight years in the 1970s. Other animal stars included the sea lion Gemini, and two parrots, Cocky (a sulphur-crested cockatoo) and Brolly (an umbrella cockatoo). The show was discontinued in 1983 when the programme's anthropomorphic treatment of animals fell out of fashion. A new children's wildlife series, The Really Wild Show, began in 1986, with the former Animal Magic co-presenter Terry Nutkins as the main host."]}, {"page": "The Way We Went Wild", "response": ["*Keith Shackleton"]}, {"page": "1923 in art", "response": ["* January 16 \u2013 Keith Shackleton, English painter and television host (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "TV Century 21", "response": ["The brainchild of writer-editor Alan Fennell (who also wrote episodes of the various Anderson TV shows) and presenter Keith Shackleton,\"British Comics Reference | British TV-related Comic Strips,\" DownTheTubes.net Retrieved 25 February 2021.
