Nicholas Shakespeare stated that some of Chatwin's impact came from the difficulty of categorising his work, which helped to \"set free other writers...[from] conventional boundaries.\" Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify himself as one, or as a novelist. (\"I don't quite know the meaning of the word novel,\" he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources. His friend and fellow writer Robyn Davidson said, \"He posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable.\""]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Philip Marsden"]}, {"page": "Tewodros II", "response": ["* Philip Marsden's The Barefoot Emperor chronicles the life and times of Emperor Tewodros's quest for power and his reign.

Yet he likewise supported the idea that \"the most direct way... to attain the right to live in 'Western Armenia' is by participating in the revolutionary struggle in Turkey\" and considered the option of Armenian self-determination within a revolutionary Turkish or Kurdish state.
