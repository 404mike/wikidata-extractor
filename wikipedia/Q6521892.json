West Bromwich Albion's Len Moorwood was also signed in October 1920 to provide further goalkeeping backup. Attackers Richard Cragg, Billy Clarkson and Patrick Norris were among those who left the club in pre-season. Defender Tom Bamford, who had not played a match for Burnley since before the First World War thanks to the emergence of Len Smelt, also left the club and joined Rochdale in September 1920.", "| Len Moorwood", "England international goalkeeper Jerry Dawson missed three games, two because of an injury sustained in the opening match. Centre forward Bert Freeman, who had become the first ever Burnley player to score 100\u00a0league goals, and held the club record for most goals in a season, played only four matches. His final appearance for Burnley came in the FA Cup Third Round defeat to Hull City. Several players made bit-part contributions to the campaign; Tom Brophy and Bob McGrory each made just three first-team appearances and Frank Birchenough, George Douglas, Jack Lane, Len Moorwood and Bill Taylor played in two matches or fewer. George Richardson and John Pearson, both new signings in the 1920\u201321 season, failed to make a first-team appearance for Burnley during the campaign. Thomas Jackson was a squad member until January 1921, but he did not play any games for Burnley in the 1920\u201321 campaign.", "|align=\"left\"|Len Moorwood"]}]}}
