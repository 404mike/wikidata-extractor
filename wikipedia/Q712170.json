Almost every mathematician at the time had previously considered both Fermat's Last Theorem and the Modularity Theorem either impossible or virtually impossible to prove, even given the most cutting edge developments. Wiles first announced his proof in June 1993 in a version that was soon recognized as having a serious gap at a key point. The proof was corrected by Wiles, partly in collaboration with Richard Taylor, and the final, widely accepted version was released in September 1994, and formally published in 1995. The proof uses many techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory, and has many ramifications in these branches of mathematics. It also uses standard constructions of modern algebraic geometry, such as the category of schemes and Iwasawa theory, and other 20th-century techniques not available to Fermat."]}, {"page": "List of unsolved problems in mathematics", "response": ["* Fermat's Last Theorem (Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor, 1995)", "* Modularity theorem (Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and Richard Taylor, 2001)"]}, {"page": "Richard Taylor", "response": ["Richard Taylor may refer to:", "*Richard Taylor (cartoonist) (1902\u20131970), Canadian cartoonist, The New Yorker magazine", "*Richard Taylor (British writer) (born 1967), writer and broadcaster", "*Richard Taylor (film director) (1933\u20132015), British documentary film director", "*Richard Taylor (filmmaker) (born 1960s), head of Weta Workshop special effects studio", "*Richard Taylor (Hollyoaks), a character in UK soap opera Hollyoaks", "*Richard Taylor, former member of American rock band Gin Blossoms", "*Richard Taylor (colonel) (1744\u20131829), father of U.S. president Zachary Taylor", "*Richard Taylor (Confederate general) (1826\u20131879), son of U.S. president Zachary Taylor, Confederate general in the American Civil War", "*Richard Taylor (Medal of Honor) (1834\u20131890), American Civil War soldier and Medal of Honor recipient", "*Richard Taylor (British Army officer) (1819\u20131904), British general", "*Richard Taylor (by 1517\u201373 or later), MP for Haverfordwest", "*Richard Taylor (died 1641), English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1621 to 1629", "*Richard Taylor (Royalist) (1620\u20131667), of Clapham, Bedfordshire", "*Richard Taylor (died 1699), English MP for East Retford", "*Richard Taylor (British politician) (born 1934), Independent Kidderminster Member of Parliament", "*Richard Taylor (Canadian politician) (1915\u20131991), Canadian politician in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario", "*Richard Taylor (missionary) (1805\u20131873), missionary in New Zealand", "*Richard Taylor (editor) (1781\u20131858), English naturalist and publisher of scientific journals", "*Richard Taylor (philosopher) (1919\u20132003), American metaphysical philosopher and commercial beekeeper", "*Richard Taylor (mathematician) (born 1962), involved in completing the proof of Fermat's last theorem", "*Richard Taylor (Australian footballer) (born 1973), former Hawthorn and West Coast Eagles player in the AFL", "*Richard Taylor (English footballer) (born 1957), English footballer", "*Richard Taylor (American football) (born 1985), American football cornerback", "*Richard Taylor (cross-country skier) (born 1938), American cross-country skier", "*Richard Taylor (skater) (1981\u20132004), Welsh skater", "*Richard Taylor (pirate) (fl. 1721), pirate captain also known as John Taylor"]}, {"page": "Sato\u2013Tate conjecture", "response": ["The original conjecture and its generalization to all totally real fields was proved by Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, Nicholas Shepherd-Barron, and Richard Taylor under mild assumptions in 2008, and completed by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Harris, and Taylor in 2011.
