A short length of track was laid in the vicinity in Summer 1827, very early in construction of the line, presumably for demonstration and public relations purposes. However, the cuttings to the east and west appear to have been incomplete at the time of Thomas Telford's report in early 1829. On 14 June 1830 the locomotive Arrow took a train carrying directors of the company to Manchester. On the return the train terminated at Wavertree where they were given dinner at Wavertree Hall."]}]}}
