His output includes collaborations with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Peter Skellern. He is also a keen puzzler who has hosted several quiz shows and written several books on the subject.\nStilgoe is also notable for his charity work and fundraising. In the 1980s he founded the Alchemy Foundation which is funded from his royalties from the American productions of Starlight Express and The Phantom of the Opera. He is patron of the Surrey Care Trust in Woking. In the late 1990s he founded the Orpheus Centre which offers performing arts experiences to young people with disabilities.

By the next evening, Stilgoe had produced a draft for \"Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats\". However, \"Memory\", an 11 o'clock number for Grizabella that Nunn insisted the show needed as its \"emotional centre\", still had no lyrics at this point.
