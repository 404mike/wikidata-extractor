He scored on the opening day of the following season, netting the first in a 4\u20131 home win against Ipswich Town on 18 August 1956, but suffered a serious injury in the same game, and this proved to be his only appearance of the season as Torquay went on to lose out in the final table to Ipswich on goal average, Smith regaining his place in the side as regular left-back. Returning the following season from injury he made just three more appearances for Torquay before leaving league football in 1959 to join Dover FC helping them to victory in the Kent Senior Cup that season. He subsequently played for Hastings United."]}, {"page": "Tower (surname)", "response": ["* Bill Towers (politician) (1892\u20131962), Australian politician", "* Bill Towers (footballer) (1920\u20132000), English footballer"]}, {"page": "William Towers", "response": ["William or Bill Towers may refer to:", "* Bill Towers (politician) (1892\u20131962), Australian politician", "* Bill Towers (footballer) (1920\u20132000), English footballer"]}]}}
