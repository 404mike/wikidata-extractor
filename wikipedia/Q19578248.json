An 8\u20132 victory over Crystal Palace on Christmas Day was Brentford's biggest win of the season and equalled the club record for highest aggregate score in a Football League match. The Bees also embarked on a run to the fourth round of the FA Cup, falling to First Division Portsmouth at Griffin Park. Despite the transfer of 19-goal Jack Lane to Crystal Palace in January 1931, Brentford's form improved, with Billy Lane continuing to score and new forward signings George Robson and Les Wilkins making a contribution. 9 wins in the final 31 matches saw the Bees finish the season in 3rd place, 9 points behind champions Notts County.", "Brentford's 1930\u201331 season is notable for the amount of hat-tricks scored, with Billy Lane claiming three, Jack Lane two and Frederick Gamble one, which convinced West Ham United to sign Gamble in exchange for Les Wilkins in February 1931, despite Gamble having made only 13 appearances in just under two years. During the season, Billy Lane and Jack Lane each scored a hat-trick in the same match twice during a one-month period \u2013 in the 6\u20131 FA Cup first round victory over Ilford on 29 November 1930 and in the 8\u20132 league victory over Crystal Palace on Christmas Day. Jack Lane's only goal of the game versus Norwich City in the FA Cup second round on 13 December 1930 marked the first time in the club's Football League history that three players had reached 10 goals for the season prior to Christmas Day.
