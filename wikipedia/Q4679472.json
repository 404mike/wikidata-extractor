The visitors opened the scoring after just two minutes; Felipe Morais turning in Greg Tansey's cross at the back post. Yeovil responded instantly through Paddy Madden's scissor kick. Shortly after the interval, Lucas Akins was on hand to turn in substitute Marcus Haber's low cross, before James Dunne's deflected effort doubled Stevenage's advantage and put the game beyond doubt. Four days later, Stevenage suffered their second consecutive heavy home defeat, this time losing 4\u20131 to Preston North End. The away side scored early on through Stuart Beavon's powerful strike, before Stevenage's Greg Tansey briefly restored parity with a curling effort from the edge of the area. Preston regained the lead through Jack King following good work from Jeffrey Monakana ten minutes before half-time. Two second-half long-range strikes from Monakana and Nicky Wroe respectively gave Preston a comfortable win. Another defeat followed a week later, losing 4\u20131 away to Sheffield United. The home side took the lead on the twenty-minute mark, defender Neill Collins heading home unmarked from Ryan Flynn's centre. Stevenage equalised just before half-time, captain Mark Roberts scoring with a header from Filipe Morais' corner. The parity was short-lived, however, as Shaun Miller netted twice after the interval, before Chris Porter added a fourth late-on to ensure a routine victory. Stevenage then travelled to Bournemouth three days later, securing a 1\u20131 draw. The visitors took the lead mid-way through the first-half when Marcus Haber found space down the right wing, before laying the ball onto Greg Tansey, who found the net from just outside the area. Bournemouth equalised with fifteen minutes remaining, substitute Matt Tubbs heading in Lewis Grabban's cross at the back post. Another 1\u20131 scoreline followed when Stevenage took on league leaders Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way on 24 November. The game came to life with just ten minutes left; Tranmere striker Jake Cassidy found space in the area, and headed in Adam McGurk's cross unmarked. Stevenage then hit the post late-on through Robin Shroot, before equalising deep into stoppage time when Greg Tansey picked up Mark Roberts' pass and curled a looping shot over Owain F\u00f4n Williams in the Tranmere goal. The goal was Tansey's third in four games."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|29 April 2013|| Adam McGurk ||||Released||Burton Albion||Free", "| 11 |||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Adam McGurk"]}]}}
