Doyle composed three primary themes for the film to accompany the characters of Ophelia, Claudius, and Hamlet, which are varied throughout the score. The \"simple, childlike\" theme for Ophelia is mostly string-dominant, often performed by a string quartet yet occasionally accompanied by a full string ensemble or mixed chorus. For Claudius, Doyle composed a theme in the form of a demented canon, using more 20th century harmonies. The theme for Hamlet was considered by Doyle to be \"the most daunting and elusive\" to conceive, before settling upon a more \"simple\" motif to accompany the contemplative character.Hamlet (1996): (Patrick Doyle) .

In 1984, he appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Henry V, directed by Adrian Noble. The production played to sold-out audiences, especially at the Barbican in the City of London. It was this production that he adapted for the film version of the play in 1989. He and David Parfitt founded the Renaissance Theatre Company in 1987, following success with several productions on the London 'Fringe', including Branagh's full-scale production of Romeo and Juliet at the Lyric Studio, co-starring with Samantha Bond. The first major Renaissance production was Branagh's Christmas 1987 staging of Twelfth Night at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, starring Richard Briers as Malvolio and Frances Barber as Viola, and with an original score by actor, musician, and composer Patrick Doyle, who two years later was to compose the music for Branagh's film adaptation of Henry V.

He explained, \"You had this middle-class English motif, and with the music you would have occasional outbursts of emotion.\" Doyle explains that the score \"becomes a little more grown-up\" as the story progresses to one of \"maturity and an emotional catharsis.\" The score contains romantic elements and has been described  by National Public Radio as a \"restricted compass\u00a0... of emotion\" with \"instruments [that] blend together in a gentle sort of way\".
