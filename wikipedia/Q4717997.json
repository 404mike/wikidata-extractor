He played twice for Arsenal before the outbreak of war, but served mainly as understudy to George Swindin and Alex Wilson; however he did play the final two games of the 1938-39 season, his debut coming against Derby County on 29 April 1939.

In the three seasons running up to the Second World War, as Albion finished third, fifth and third, Wilson missed only nine matches in league and FA Cup. During the war he served as a Physical Training Instructor and when duty permitted, appeared for Albion in the wartime competitions. He resumed his career with appearances in all ten of Albion's 1945\u201346 FA Cup matches and 39 of their 42 fixtures in the first post-war league season. He then retired as a player and was appointed assistant to trainer Alex Wilson. When Alex Wilson left the club in 1952, Wilson succeeded him as trainer, a post he held for 18 years. In 1963, he had a brief spell as caretaker manager between George Curtis's departure and the arrival of Archie Macaulay.Carder & Harris, Albion A\u2013Z, p. 311. After five years as chief scout, he retired in 1974."]}]}}
