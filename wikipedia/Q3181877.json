He was last seen stumbling through the mud blindly, with a possible facial injury. A body identified as his was found in 1992, although that identification has been challenged. In 2015, the Commonwealth War Grave Commission confirmed that it had correctly identified the burial place of John Kipling; they record his date of death as 27 September 1915, and that he is buried at St Mary's A.D.S. Cemetery, Haisnes.", "John's death has been linked to Kipling's 1916 poem \"My Boy Jack\", notably in the play My Boy Jack and its subsequent television adaptation, along with the documentary Rudyard Kipling: A Remembrance Tale. However, the poem was originally published at the head of a story about the Battle of Jutland and appears to refer to a death at sea; the \"Jack\" referred to may be to the boy VC Jack Cornwell, or perhaps a generic \"Jack Tar\". In the Kipling family, Jack was the name of the family dog, while John Kipling was always John, making the identification of the protagonist of \"My Boy Jack\" with John Kipling somewhat questionable. However, Kipling was indeed emotionally devastated by the death of his son. He is said to have assuaged his grief by reading the novels of Jane Austen aloud to his wife and daughter.\"The Many Lovers of Miss Jane Austen\", BBC2 broadcast, 9\u00a0pm 23 December 2011 During the war, he wrote a booklet The Fringes of the FleetThe Fringes of the Fleet, Macmillan & Co., 1916. containing essays and poems on various nautical subjects of the war.

The Blues were in Major General Mansel's brigade, as the allies laid siege to Landrecies.  Mansel was criticized as being slow to engage the enemy, when a large French force left Cambrai on 23 April 1794.
