In 1906, Byam Shaw exhibited at the Royal Academy a full-length watercolour portrait of her, entitled \"Maud, Daughter of His Honour Judge Tindal Atkinson.\" The painting is reproduced in Rex Vicat Cole's \"Art and Life of Byam Shaw\" (London: Seeley Service, 1932), with the following commentary: \"[This work] a water-colour is life-size, of a beautiful sitter, one of his students; her portrait appears in many illustrations [by Byam Shaw] of this and a later period, and in the picture entitled \"The Caged Bird\" and in the wistful face of the girl to the right of the picture \"The New Voice\". Her natural charm, added to a gift for understanding what was in the artist's mind, as well as an admiration for his work and sympathetic help, made her a valued friend and an ideal sitter.\"(p.142). \"The New Voice\", reproduced by Cole (p.\u00a0158) was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1909. In it, Atkinson appears naked to the waist: it is a strikingly eroticised portrayal unintentionally reminiscent of soft pornography of the Edwardian era, and indicates that she was by no means hidebound by Edwardian convention. This bizarre painting, somewhat similar to works of a decade earlier by the German painter Arnold Boecklin, represents 'a group of pagans' in the evening light (rather similar to those in early productions of Ravel's Diaghilev ballet 'Daphnis and Chloe', 1912) who suddenly notice the diminutive figure of St John the Baptist on a distant hillside, proclaiming the Christian message. Byam Shaw was a committed Anglican and doubtless painted the work as a sincere contribution to Christian art; yet its erotic elements outstrip its moralizing intentions, leaving a distinctly ambivalent impression on the viewer.  Byam Shaw placed his signature in a cartouche in the shape of a scroll, giving rise to the nickname 'the Scroll School' for himself and his friends Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale and Frank Cadogan Cowper. Atkinson used a similar device to support her own signature on works in watercolour."]}, {"page": "Crystal Palace School", "response": ["* Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale"]}, {"page": "The Uninvited Guest", "response": ["* The Uninvited Guest, a 1906 painting by English artist Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale"]}, {"page": "Women Painters of the World", "response": ["*Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale"]}, {"page": "List of English women artists", "response": ["*Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale (1872\u20131945), artist, illustrator"]}, {"page": "Miss Fortescue-Brickdale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale"]}, {"page": "Eleanor Fortesque-Brickdale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale"]}, {"page": "Mary Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale"]}, {"page": "Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale"]}]}}
