The transcripts were published as part of a special two-volume first edition of Northwest Passage. However, Roberts fell behind in writing the book as a result of the inability to find the transcripts, and he had to finish the last part of the story (beginning with the journey from Michilimackinac) while on holiday in Italy, without the help of Tarkington. Another friend of Roberts, novelist A. Hamilton Gibbs (author of the number one bestseller of 1925, Soundings), performed an editing function similar to Tarkington for the last section.  Some critics of the time found the transition in prose style to be jarring."]}, {"page": "Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1920s", "response": ["# Soundings by A.
