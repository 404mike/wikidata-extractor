His achievements continued the tradition of successful British men's breaststroke swimming that had started with Olympic golds from David Wilkie in 1976 and Duncan Goodhew in 1980. Moorhouse himself then inspired a new generation of British male breaststroke swimmers, starting with his domestic rival, double Olympic medalist Nick Gillingham, through to 2003 World Champion James Gibson, and more recently 2012 Olympic silver medalist Michael Jamieson, and, most notably, reigning Olympic, World, European, and Commonwealth Champion and world record holder in the 50m and 100m breaststroke, Adam Peaty, on whose 2016 Olympic victory Moorhouse commentated for BBC television alongside his former Olympic teammate and butterfly medalist Andy Jameson."]}, {"page": "Kelly College", "response": ["*Andy Jameson, BBC Sports commentator & former Olympic swimmer"]}, {"page": "Chesterfield High School", "response": ["* Andy Jameson, swimmer and bronze medal winner at the 1988 OlympicsChesterfield High School History .
