The 1914\u201315 season was their nineteenth season of league football, since joining the Southern League as West Hertfordshire for the 1896\u201397 season. Watford finished the season as champions of the Southern League First Division, winning 22 and drawing 8 of their 38 league matches. In other competitions, Watford were eliminated from the FA Cup in the sixth qualifying round by Rochdale, and from the Southern Charity Cup by fellow Southern League team Luton Town. The club's manager was Harry Kent, and its top scorer George Edmonds, with 17 goals from 35 appearances. Other notable players included Skilly Williams, who began what would be a 13-year period as the club's first choice goalkeeper,Illustrated Who's Who p. 243 and Fred Gregory, whose goal against Gillingham sealed the title for Watford.Illustrated Who's Who p. 101 Gregory and Williams were also the only two men to play in all 40 of Watford's games.", "The new year brought a dramatic change in fortunes for Watford's season. Watford won 10 and drew 2 of their first 12 games of 1915, with George Edmonds, Peter Ronald and injured Charlie White's replacement Arthur Green all scoring freely. A win and a defeat against Luton Town, a 2\u20130 defeat to West Ham United and a heavy 6\u20130 loss at Swindon enabled Reading and Cardiff to close in on Watford's points tally and goal average. But Watford secured the title in their penultimate match, with Fred Gregory scoring the decisive goal in a 3\u20132 win at Gillingham."]}, {"page": "Val Gregory", "response": ["Gregory was born in Pinner, Middlesex on Valentine's Day 1888, leading to him being christened Valentine.
