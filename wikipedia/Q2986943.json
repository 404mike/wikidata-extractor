At the 2008 Labour Party Conference, Sarah caused surprise by taking to the stage to introduce her husband for his keynote address. Since then her public profile has increased.", "Brown is a strong supporter of the NHS, partly due to both the experimental surgery that saved the sight in his right eye after his retina became detached, and the care he and Sarah Brown received when their premature firstborn baby died. It has been suggested that visual difficulties have contributed to Brown's supposed antisocial nature and awkward public manner. For example, both on a podium and before a camera, while reading \"he needs to look slightly to one side of the paper to focus; when speaking to an audience or into a camera lens, he must remember to correct what would normally be an automatic tendency to look slightly askew to see clearly with his good eye\". Brown's papers were prepared in capital letters and in extremely large type, resulting in his stack of papers at the dispatch box being noticeably bulky due to fewer words per page. Former staffers often attributed Brown's outbursts of temper in Downing Street to his frustration with his visual limitations. Nevertheless it is noted that he has never allowed these limitations to hold him back and in fact attributed them to the shaping of his political character.

F. Deedes (2004) Brief Lives were exacerbated by Lady Avon (described by historian Barry Turner, without explanation, as \"equally touchy\"Barry Turner (2006) Suez 1956). One of Eden's private secretaries claimed that \"she had a habit of stirring up Anthony when he didn't need it\".Sir Philip de Zulueta, quoted in Alistair Horne (1988) Macmillan, Volume I: 1894\u20131956 However, Eden's biographer D. R. Thorpe concluded that such imputations arose from a misreading of the Edens' relationship, noting also that, during Suez, the only two people in whom Eden could confide without inhibition were his wife and the Queen. Indeed, as historian Ben Pimlott put it, \"if Lady Eden came to believe that the Suez Canal flowed through her drawing room, the Queen must have felt pretty damp as well\".Ben Pimlott (1996) The Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth II David Dutton, another (not notably sympathetic) biographer of Eden, noted that \"some observers believed that Clarissa was excessively protective and tended to exacerbate Eden's natural volatility\" but also remarked on her devoted companionship and that \"during the dark days of the Suez Crisis, [she] was at his side, supportive throughout\".David Dutton (1997) Anthony Eden: A Life and Reputation. Whatever effect Lady Avon had on Eden's temperament, it has been far from uncommon for Prime Ministerial behaviour to be influenced by protective spouses. Despite strong evidence of Sarah Brown's calming influence on her husband, Gordon Brown, who was Prime Minister from 2007 to 2010, it has been suggested that \"her intense love and protection ... made her deeply angry when he was under attack, and this could heighten his paranoia about those who were seeking to do him down\": Anthony Seldon & Guy Lodge (2010) Brown at 10.
