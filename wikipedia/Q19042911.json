Sherwood agreed to train the horse at a reduced rate of thirty shillings a week instead of the usual fifty as he had very few horses in his stable at the time. At the end of 1883, Brace succeeded in selling St. Gatien for \u00a31,400 to Jack Hammond, a former stable-boy who had made his fortune as a professional gambler. In 1885, St. Gatien was moved to the stable of James Waugh.", "At about this time there was a serious disagreement between Jack Hammond and Robert Sherwood, which resulted in Hammond removing all his horses, including St. Gatien from Sherwood's stable and moving them across Newmarket to the Middleton Cottage stable of James Waugh."]}, {"page": "Otto Madden", "response": ["He was born to a jockey father, who had ridden Kincsem an unbeaten horse that won 54 races from 54 starts.
