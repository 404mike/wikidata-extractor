Liverpool had led 2\u20131 and 4\u20132 in the original tie and first replay before drawing both matches after conceding late goals and a second replay was abandoned with Liverpool leading 1\u20130 after Sheffield fans ran onto the pitch on more than one occasion. Liverpool would eventually lose 1\u20130 in a fourth match and Raisbeck would be called into a hearing by a disciplinary panel after Liverpool players \" severely jostled\" the referee at the end of the match having been aggrieved at his decisions. The referee believed Raisbeck had witnessed the incident and asked him to name the players responsible but Raisbeck refused, later stating \"I did not think any of our players had had anything to do with the demonstration\". Along with teammates Walker and William Goldie, he was reported by the referee over the incident but was later cleared of any wrongdoing. In the league, Liverpool finished as runners-up to Aston Villa after losing their final match of the season."]}, {"page": "Bill Goldie", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Goldie"]}, {"page": "Goldie (surname)", "response": ["*William Goldie (1878\u20131952), Scottish footballer, brother of Archie"]}, {"page": "Goldie, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Goldie"]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (unofficial matches)", "response": ["*A testimonial match for Liverpool's Scottish player William Goldie in November 1902 was played between an 'England Select XI ' and a 'Scotland Select XI' drawn from players at Merseyside clubs; the Scots won 4\u20130.England Select XI v Scotland Select XI 0-4 (William Goldie's Benefit), Liverpool Courier, 4 November 1902 (via Play Up, Liverpool)"]}]}}
