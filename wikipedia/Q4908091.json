Nevertheless, the director insists that he has the club's backing to sign players from Cameroon and Italy, and publicly berates rival club Stoke City, whilst Bell states that he is in negotiations for a player-exchange deal with Brazilian club Corinthian. In October, Machin tells the press that he would sack Brian Horton if the club had the money to pay for his severance package; meanwhile Marketing Manager Rob Edwards resigns after less than two months into the job. Machin quit the club in November, and two months later set up 'Valiant2001', a fan based consortium looking to buy the club off Bill Bell. Former vice-chairman Mike Thompstone also attempted a takeover of the club, which was resisted by Bell. The Valiant2001 project took off with Machin at the helm, who said he should be the new chairman as \"I can't think of anyone I trust more than myself\". The project raised \u00a373,000 by June, and Thompstone also pledged his support. Ex-director Stephen Plant also sued the Bell and the club in November, and made a \u00a3100,000 settlement in May. Another director, shopkeeper Neil Hughes, resigned in February; he returned to the club the next month, only to resign for a second time in six weeks.

On 21 October, Vale played rivals Stoke City, and McPhee scored for Vale, before Chris Iwelumo buried a late equaliser for the \"Potters\". The next month Danny Webber was taken in on loan from Manchester United. Vale continued through the Christmas period in inconsistent form, despite the arrival of 36-year-old John Durnin. In January, Mvondo Atangana became the first Cameroonian to play for the Vale, when he joined on loan from Dundee United \u2013 he would only play two games before picking up a serious injury. Meanwhile, Richard Burgess was allowed to join Nuneaton Borough permanently. Vale then went on a sequence of seven wins in eight games to shoot up the table, including a 1\u20130 win over Stoke at the Britannia Stadium thanks to a Micky Cummins header, as Horton was named Manager of the Month. This run raised hopes of a play-off bid. It also encouraged chairman Bill Bell to offer new contracts to the management team (Horton, Grew, Foyle and Glover), as well as seven players.

In August, former chairman Jim Lloyd returned to the club as a director. The next month, Chief Executive Dave Jolley was sacked. A Charles Machin led consortium made a \u00a31 million bid for the club in December, but were turned away by Bill Bell, who claimed that Valiant2001 \"won't last three months\".

The club approached millionaire pop star and Vale fan Robbie Williams, who rejected the opportunity to invest in the club. Rumours circulated of a possible merger with rivals Stoke City and a ground-share at the Britannia Stadium, fuelled by the belief that a 'mystery bidder' was in fact the Icelandic owners of Stoke City. Stoke Holdings, the Icelandic company which owned Stoke City, offered Bill Bell \u00a350,000 to buy his debt and thereby take control of the club by bypassing the administrators; however Bell rejected the offer. Valiant2001 eventually agreed to rent the club shop off Bell as an incitement for him to accept their offer (his vote was needed as he was the club's biggest creditor). The administrators received a number of bids for the club, and received interest from Mo Chaudry (owner of WaterWorld), Summerbank Management (Tunstall based consultancy firm), and property developing duo Steve Ball and Iain McIntosh.
