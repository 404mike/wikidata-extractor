That was the only season he played for United, but he was invited to join the board in 1942 and after the abrupt departure of manager Jimmy Allan in October of that year, he was asked by fellow directors to take over. He remained in post for just over two years, a period in which United struggled in the North Eastern League as they found it difficult to attract the better players available during the unusual conditions of wartime. Littlejohn handed over the manager's job to one of his players, Charlie McGillivray, in November 1944, but remained a director."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Allan", "response": ["Jimmy Allan may refer to:", "*Jimmy Allan (cricketer) (1932\u20132005), Scottish first-class cricketer", "*Jimmy Allan (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131982), Scottish football player and manager (Dundee United)", "*Jimmy Allan (footballer, born 1953), Scottish footballer (Swindon Town)"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Allan (Scottish footballer b. 1897)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Allan (footballer, born 1896)"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Allan (footballer born 1897)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Allan (footballer, born 1896)"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Allan (footballer, born 1897)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Allan (footballer, born 1896)"]}]}}
