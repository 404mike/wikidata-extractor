After settling in England, he was employed as piano teacher (and concert manager) at the James Ching Pianoforte School. Later in life he gave many masterclasses in both the UK and Europe for organisations such as the European Piano Teachers Association (EPTA), but it is as a private teacher that he is probably best remembered. Robert Finley recalls that his teacher was an advocate of the Alexander Technique and that \"he emphasised relaxation \u2026 and avoiding the build up of muscular tension and stress\". Kathron Sturrock commends Ferber's \"gentle and helpful wisdom\" which saw her \"through many a dark moment\", whilst Penelope Thwaites describes him as an \"exceptional teacher \u2026 interested in drawing out the individuality of his pupils; believing in that individuality and conveying confidence: a rare gift\". She also states that he was \"much loved by all his pupils\"."]}, {"page": "Duncan McTier", "response": ["He recorded a series of albums with the pianist Kathron Sturrock."]}, {"page": "Fibonacci Sequence (ensemble)", "response": ["Pianist Kathron Sturrock is the artistic director.
