He is a senior lecturer in classics at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Emmanuel College.

These trance visions are a function of the human brain and so are independent of geographical location. Nigel Spivey, a professor of classical art and archeology at the University of Cambridge, has further postulated in his series, How Art Made the World, that dot and lattice patterns overlapping the representational images of animals are very similar to hallucinations provoked by sensory-deprivation. He further postulates that the connections between culturally important animals and these hallucinations led to the invention of image-making, or the art of drawing."]}, {"page": "San people", "response": ["The BBC series How Art Made the World (2005) compares San cave paintings from 200 years ago to Paleolithic European paintings that are 14,000 years old. Because of their similarities, the San works may illustrate the reasons for ancient cave paintings. The presenter Nigel Spivey draws largely on the work of Professor David Lewis-Williams, whose PhD was entitled \"Believing and Seeing: Symbolic meanings in southern San rock paintings\". Lewis-Williams draws parallels with prehistoric art around the world, linking in shamanic ritual and trance states."]}, {"page": "Supernormal stimulus", "response": ["British academic Nigel Spivey demonstrates the effect in the first episode of the 2005 BBC documentary series How Art Made the World to illustrate neuroscientist Vilayanur S.

(1996), \"Hagesander, Athanodorus and Polydorus\", in Hornblower, Simon, Oxford Classical Dictionary, Oxford: Oxford University Press.Boardman, 199; Smith, 109\u2013110 It is noteworthy that Pliny does not address this issue explicitly, in a way that suggests \"he regards it as an original\".Isager, 173  Pliny states that it was located in the palace of the emperor Titus, and it is possible that it remained in the same place until 1506 (see \"Findspot\" section below). He also asserts that it was carved from a single piece of marble, though the Vatican work comprises at least seven interlocking pieces.Howard 417\u2013418 and figure 1 has the fullest account used of the complicated situation here; with the damages and after the various restorations he lists 14 parts (417, note 4) when the group was last dismantled.

He identified the small valley, shown on a later map as \"The Valley of the Shadow of Death\", as the place where Fenton had taken his photograph (see right). Two pictures were taken of this area, one with several cannonballs on the road, the other with an empty road. Hitherto opinions differed concerning which one was taken first but Morris spotted evidence that the photo without the cannonballs was taken first. He remains uncertain about why balls were moved onto the road in the second picture\u2014perhaps, he notes, Fenton probably deliberately placed them there to enhance the image. The alternative is that soldiers were gathering up cannonballs for reuse and they threw down balls higher up the hill onto the road and ditch for collection later. Other art historians, such as Nigel Spivey of Cambridge University, identify the images as from the nearby Woronzoff Road. In June 1855 illustrator and war correspondent William Simpson produced a watercolour of the Woronzoff Road, but looking downhill, which has cannonballs similarly placed to those shown by Fenton; Simpson's publisher too used the title \"The Valley of the Shadow of Death\". This is the location accepted by the local tour guides."]}, {"page": "Spivey", "response": ["*Nigel Spivey (born 1958), British professor of classical art and archaeology"]}, {"page": "World of Art", "response": ["| Etruscan Art || Nigel Spivey || 1997"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Academics of the University of Cambridge", "response": ["Nigel Spiveynot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Runciman Award", "response": ["| 1997 || Nigel Spivey || Understanding Greek Sculpture:Ancient Meanings, Modern Readings || Thames and Hudson"]}, {"page": "Necropolis", "response": ["The Etruscans took the concept of a \"city of the dead\" quite literally. The typical tomb at the Banditaccia necropolis at Cerveteri consists of a tumulus which covers one or more rock-cut subterranean tombs. These tombs had multiple chambers and were elaborately decorated like contemporary houses. The arrangement of the tumuli in a grid of streets gave it an appearance similar to the cities of the living. The art historian Nigel Spivey considers the name cemetery inadequate and argues that only the term necropolis can do justice to these sophisticated burial sites. Etruscan necropoli were usually located on hills or slopes of hills."]}, {"page": "How Art Made the World", "response": ["\"The essential premise of the show,\" according to Nigel Spivey, \"is that of all the defining characteristics of humanity as a species, none is more basic than the inclination to make art.
