Pronunciation dictionaries represent a special class of dictionary giving a wide range of possible pronunciations: British pronunciation dictionaries are all based on RP, though not necessarily using that name. Daniel Jones transcribed RP pronunciations of words and names in the English Pronouncing Dictionary. Cambridge University Press continues to publish this title, as of 1997 edited by Peter Roach. Two other pronunciation dictionaries are in common use: the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary, compiled by John C. Wells (using the name \"Received Pronunciation\"), and Clive Upton's Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English, (now republished as The Routledge Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English).", "There are differing opinions as to whether  in the BATH lexical set can be considered RP. The pronunciations with  are invariably accepted as RP. The English Pronouncing Dictionary does not admit  in BATH words and the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary lists them with a \u00a7 marker of non-RP status. John Wells wrote in a blog entry on 16 March 2012 that when growing up in the north of England he used  in \"bath\" and \"glass\", and considers this the only acceptable phoneme in RP. Others have argued that  is too categorical in the north of England to be excluded. Clive Upton believes that  in these words must be considered within RP and has called the opposing view \"south-centric\". Upton's Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English gives both variants for BATH words. A. F. Gupta's survey of mostly middle-class students found that  was used by almost everyone who was from clearly north of the isogloss for BATH words. She wrote, \"There is no justification for the claims by Wells and Mugglestone that this is a sociolinguistic variable in the north, though it is a sociolinguistic variable on the areas on the border [the isogloss between north and south]\". In a study of speech in West Yorkshire, K. M. Petyt wrote that \"the amount of  usage is too low to correlate meaningfully with the usual factors\", having found only two speakers (both having attended boarding schools in the south) who consistently used .", "Most of these variants are used in the transcription devised by Clive Upton for the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993) and now used in many other Oxford University Press dictionaries."]}, {"page": "Cockney", "response": ["Certain features of cockney \u2013 Th-fronting, L-vocalisation, T-glottalisation, and the fronting of the GOAT and GOOSE vowels \u2013 have spread across the south-east of England and, to a lesser extent, to other areas of Britain.
