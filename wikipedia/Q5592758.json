He is the record appearance holder for Leicester City, making 599 appearances for the club in all competitions.\nHe spent most of his career playing for Leicester City originally as an inside forward, then later as a centre-half and occasionally a right half. At Leicester he holds the record for the most appearances for the club with 599 between 1961 and 1975. He went on to join Brighton & Hove Albion and then Preston North End. He made the record number of appearances for the England Under 23 side but never made a full international appearance.\nHe also represented Leicestershire as a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler between 1961 and 1977. In 83 first-class matches, he scored 2,079 runs (average 18.39), highest score 78 with eight fifties and 61 catches. He took 92 wickets (average 29.95), best bowling 4/28. In 51 ListA matches, he scored 701 runs (average 20.61), highest score 57* with three fifties and 17 catches. He took 63 wickets (average 20.23), best bowling 4/11.\nAppearing irregularly because of his football commitments, Cross was nevertheless a good enough player to find a place in Ray Illingworth's successful county side of the late '70s. Cross's last appearance came when the side was stricken by illness in May 1977. A scratch side had to be assembled to play Hampshire at Grace Road in the B&H Cup. Showing his habitual adaptability, he kept wicket for the only time during his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["Graham Cross holds the record for the most Leicester appearances, with the defender playing 600 games between 1960 and 1976, increased from 599 following the club's decision to incorporate the 1971 Charity Shield into official records.

Incoming manager Alan Mullery had planned to also play in midfield for the club but after witnessing Horton in his first training session he came to the conclusion that Horton would provide the necessary leadership and skill on the pitch, so Mullery retired as a player to concentrate fully on management. For his performances at both Vale and Brighton, Horton was named on the PFA Team of the Year, along with Brighton teammates Graham Cross and Peter Ward. The \"Seagulls\" finished second in 1976\u201377 under Mullery's stewardship, and thus were promoted into the Second Division. Mullery was however disappointed in his players after they won only one of their final four games to miss out on the chance of winning the divisional title.

Gillies became well known for his ability to spot a good player during his time at Filbert Street bringing through the ranks future FWA Footballer of the Year winners Gordon Banks and Frank McLintock and future PFA Player of the Year Peter Shilton, as well as club favourites Dave Gibson, Lenny Glover and Graham Cross. Leicester reached the FA Cup final twice under the stewardship of Gillies in 1961 and 1963. In 1961, they were on the losing side to double winners Tottenham, and as a result were England's representatives in the 1961\u201362 European Cup Winners' Cup in which Leicester were knocked out by eventual winners Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the first round. In 1963, Leicester chased the double. The coldest winter for decades meant Leicester were forced to play a backlogged fixture list on ice, then went on a then club-record 18-game unbeaten culminating in the club sitting atop the First Division on 16 April 1963, causing the press to label Leicester as the \"ice kings\". However, injuries (possibly feigned in light of the upcoming FA Cup final) eventually took their toll and Leicester took just one point from their final five games, seeing them fall to fourth position, though this was still the club's best post-war finish up until the 2015\u201316 season, where Leicester won the Premier League.
