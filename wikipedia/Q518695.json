A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going\". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Black and white charcoal drawings of key locations and sets were created by Furst's longtime draftsman, Nigel Phelps. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, overseeing the miniatures and animation. Conceptual illustrator Julian Caldow designed the Batmobile, Batwing and assorted bat-gadgets that were later constructed by prop builder John Evans. Keith Short sculpted the final body of the 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns.Keith Short, Building the Batmobile, 2005, Warner Home Video On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, \"We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s\". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.

These productions were created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed at APF's studios on the Slough Trading Estate. The characters were played by electronic marionettes with a moveable lower lip, which opened and closed in time with pre-recorded dialogue by means of a solenoid in the puppet's head or chest. The productions were mostly science fiction with the puppetry supervised by Christine Glanville, art direction by either Bob Bell or Keith Wilson, and music composed by Barry Gray. They also made extensive use of scale model special effects, directed by Derek Meddings.", "Underwater sequences were filmed not in water, but on dry sets with a thin aquarium between the set and the camera to distort the lighting. Bubble jets and small fish were added to the aquarium to create forced perspective.Meddings, pp.\u00a016-17. Beginning with Stingray, shots of aircraft in flight were filmed using a technique called the \"rolling sky\", which was devised by effects director Derek Meddings to allow filming of dynamic shots in confined space. It involved painting the sky background on a canvas, which was then wrapped around a pair of electrically driven rollers, and creating an impression of movement by running the canvas around the rollers in a continuous loop as opposed to moving the miniature aircraft itself.Meddings, pp.\u00a036-37.

One of the series' technical innovations was that the noses of miniature vehicles would now \"dip\" as they came to a stop, to imitate the sudden application of brakes on a real-life vehicle. The vehicles were designed by Meddings or his assistant Mike Trim: the former created Cloudbase, the SPV and the Angel fighter (the last of these during a flight to New York), while the latter produced many of the less prominent vehicles. The Cloudbase filming model, which was  long, proved too heavy to be held up with wires so was instead mounted on a pole.Archer 1993, p.\u00a023.Bentley 2001, p.\u00a021.

He suggested that the transition from caricature to realism was at the expense of the marionettes' \"character and personality\", arguing that \"if the puppet appears completely natural, the audience no longer has to use its imagination.\" Effects director Derek Meddings thought that although the new puppets were \"very convincing miniature people\", they were flawed in that audiences \"couldn't identify one from the other. The heads were so small they didn't have any character to their faces.\" Supervising puppeteer Christine Glanville considered the puppets \"awful\" from a practical perspective, recalling that their smaller, lighter heads rarely moved fluidly: \"If you wanted them to turn their heads then more often than not there would be someone out of shot, with their fingers just above the puppet's head, actually turning it round.\""]}, {"page": "1995 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 10 || Derek Meddings || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 64 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| Spies Like Us || Warner Bros. || John Landis (director); Dan Aykroyd, Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel (screenplay); Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Donna Dixon, Bruce Davison, William Prince, Steve Forrest, Tom Hatten, Bernie Casey, Charles McKeown, Vanessa Angel, James Daughton, Jim Staahl, Frank Oz, Terry Gilliam, Ray Harryhausen, Derek Meddings, Joel Coen, Sam Raimi, Martin Brest, Costa-Gavras, Bob Hope, B.B.
