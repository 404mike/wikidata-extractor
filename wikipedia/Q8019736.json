At 13 acres, it is the largest private, open green space in Central London, despite this, it is not large enough for all pupils doing these sports to use simultaneously the three football pitches and typically one smaller practise pitch become one main cricket square and several smaller practise squares for the cricket season. So the school hires and owns other sporting facilities near the school. These include the oldest boating club in the world, an astroturf ground in Battersea, and the Queen Mother Sports Centre, home to a variety of sports. \"Green\" (Dean's Yard) is also used, as are the two school gyms, one in the Abbey Cloisters and one in the Weston Building, and the three Eton Fives courts in Ashburnham Garden, the garden behind Ashburnham House."]}, {"page": "St John's, Smith Square", "response": ["*1803\u20131807 William Vincent (as Dean of Westminster)"]}, {"page": "Poets' Corner", "response": ["| William Vincent"]}, {"page": "Jacob Bryant", "response": ["In his books on Troy, Bryant endeavoured to show that the existence of Troy and the Greek expedition were purely mythological, with no basis in real history.

The chapel was damaged in April 1645 in a military engagement in the English Civil War, and in the 1780s it was demolished.
