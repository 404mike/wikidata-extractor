In this case the revisions were minor and largely stylistic.

Vergil claimed that most of his work on the last book was done contemporaneously, and that the work was interrupted by a visit to Italy. This must refer to his visit of 1533\u201334, and the entire period from 1530 to 1537 is in fact treated cursorily. Denys Hay finds it reasonable to suppose that at first Vergil planned this book to describe events up to 1530, but that he postponed the publication of it due to the political uncertainties in England, enabling him to extend the terminal date.Hay 1952, pp. 83\u201384."]}, {"page": "Battle of Solway Moss", "response": ["James V wrote to the Pope Paul III on 9 November 1542 about the English raid, and explained that he defied Henry VIII's attempts to convert him to the Protestant faith by waging war with his vast resources gained from the dissolution of the monasteries.Denys Hay, Letters of James V (Edinburgh, 1954), p. 444."]}, {"page": "War of the League of Cambrai", "response": ["In 1512 Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset led an unsuccessful English military expedition to France to reconquer Aquitaine, which England had lost during the Hundred Years' War.
