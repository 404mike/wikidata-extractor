Her parents were John and Emily (n\u00e9e Warren) Rogers. She married Rev. William Griffiths, the vicar of St Issey, Cornwall in 1794 but after his death she moved her family of five children to Torquay. She died in Torquay on 4 January 1858.\nShe corresponded with the botanist William Henry Harvey for many years, becoming a close friend. They met at Torquay in 1839.\nHarvey dedicated his 1849 Manual of British Algae to her, and once wrote \"If I lean to glorify any one, it is Mrs Griffiths, to whom I owe much of the little acquaintance I have with the variations to which these plants are subject, and who is always ready to supply me with fruits of plants which every one else finds barren. She is worth ten thousand other collectors.\"\nCarl Adolph Agardh named Griffithsia in her honour in 1817.Griffiths was the first to describe Ceramium agardhianum A.W.Griffiths ex Harvey 1841 (now C. deslongchampsii) and the species Ceramium botryocarpum in 1844.\nThe standard author abbreviation A.W.Griffiths is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.One of her servants, Mary Wyatt, became involved in collecting and selling books of seaweeds as part of her business selling collectables and local souvenirs with assistance from Griffiths.She collected a large number of specimens.  Some were sent to other collectors or scientists while she mounted others in albums herself. After her death, her own herbarium became part of Torquay Museum and there are 3 albums of her specimens in Exeter\u2019s Royal Albert Memorial Museum. Others became part of the collections in the British Museum including 780 British seaweeds purchased in 1852 and 880 specimens presented by the North Devon Athenaeum in 1917.  She had also provided material to other collectors and these have also found their way into national collections. In addition, some are now within the Kew Herbarium. Her daughter, Amelia Elizabeth Griffiths (1802-1861), also collected seaweeds and some of her collections have been mistaken for those of her mother.", "link_mentions": {}}}
