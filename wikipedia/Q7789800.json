He made a number of recordings on a reel to reel tape recorder, which family members circulated after his death. In the late 1990s some of these tapes were transferred to CD.\nIn 2002 Nel Records put out a small pressing of Long Gone Lonesome Blues a selection of some of the original tapes. Two more CDs followed (You & My Old Guitar (2003) and Treasure Untold (2005)), and a yearly Thomas Fraser memorial festival was begun in Shetland in 2002. A fourth CD of previously unreleased material, That Far Away Land, was released in November 2008.

A DVD featuring this programme and highlights of the annual Thomas Fraser Festival was released in October 2009.
