Dame schools, which had existed long before, had shown the need for childcare of very young children for women who worked outside the home. The new infant schools were to provide a safe environment for these children as well as give them some educational advantages. Wilderspin's schools were based on the reform education theory of Swiss thinker Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. James Pierrepont Greaves, secretary of the Infant School Society, worked with Pestalozzi for several years, as did Charles Mayo, who along with his sister Elizabeth Mayo, worked with the Home and Colonial Institution (later the Home and Colonial Infant School Society) to set up infant schools and train teachers."]}, {"page": "Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi", "response": ["Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel, the creator of the concept of the kindergarten, was a student of Pestalozzi.

A philosophical society founded by him in 1836, and known as the \"Aesthetic Society\", met for some time at a house in Burton Street in Camden. His educational experiences gradually led him to his unconventional philosophical views. \"As Being is before knowing and doing, I affirm that education can never repair the defects of Birth\". Hence the necessity of \"the divine existence being developed and associated with man and woman prior to marriage\". He was a follower of Jacob Boehme and influenced by German transcendentalism. He was also influenced by Thomas Taylor, William Law and the philosophy of neoplatonism.J F C Harrison. The second coming: popular millenarianism, 1780-1850 (Taylor & Francis, 1979) p159. Greaves worked with Charles and Elizabeth Mayo to found the Home and Colonial School Society in Gray\u2019s Inn Road in 1836. This teaching institution was dedicated to Pestalozzi whose educational ideas ignored the idea of rote-learning. The new organization included a model infant school where these ideas could be developed.Home and Colonial School Society, UCL, retrieved 1 January 2014."]}, {"page": "Highbury Fields School", "response": ["The school is credited with being a successor institution to the educational ideas introduced to England by Charles and Elizabeth Mayo at the school on Grey's Inn Road.Home and Colonial School Society, UCL, retrieved 1 January 2014"]}, {"page": "Home and Colonial School Society", "response": ["The Home and Colonial School Society was a school founded in 1836 by Elizabeth Mayo, Charles Mayo, James Pierrepont Greaves and John S.
