In 1864, William Rutter Dawes observed that \"the ruddy tint of the planet does not arise from any peculiarity of its atmosphere; it seems to be fully proved by the fact that the redness is always deepest near the centre, where the atmosphere is thinnest.\" Spectroscopic observations in the 1860s and 1870s led many to think the atmosphere of Mars is similar to Earth's. In 1894, though, spectral analysis and other qualitative observations by William Wallace Campbell suggested Mars resembles the Moon, which has no appreciable atmosphere, in many respects. In 1926, photographic observations by William Hammond Wright at the Lick Observatory allowed Donald Howard Menzel to discover quantitative evidence of Mars's atmosphere."]}, {"page": "William Dawes (British Marines officer)", "response": ["His son, William Rutter Dawes, was born on 17 December 1797, and christened at Portsea, Hampshire, on 11 February 1798.Parish registers for St. Mary's Church, Portsea, 1666\u20131875 Church of England.

The constellation figures are drawn from Uranometria, but they were carefully reworked and adapted to a broader view of the sky. In 1693, a newer edition was published and in 1700 another edition appeared. They include new information, such as the paths of comets observed since 1674. The atlas uses gnomonic projection so that the plates make up a cube of the universe. The atlas served as a model for the star charts of William Rutter Dawes published in 1844.
