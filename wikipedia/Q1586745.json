Dann observed that Drake appears \"tight and anxious\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation.Dann (2006), pp. 59\u201360. Both were unhappy with arranger Richard Anthony Hewson's contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs.Dann (2006), p. 60. Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement. Though Boyd was sceptical about taking on an inexperienced amateur music student, he was impressed by Drake's uncharacteristic assertiveness and agreed to a trial.Boyd (2006), p. 194. Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs.
