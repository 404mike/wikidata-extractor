A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P.\u00a0wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P.\u00a0wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P.\u00a0corallina and P.\u00a0corallina var. triternata, and P.\u00a0wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P.\u00a0triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P.\u00a0corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P.\u00a0wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow was the first to think that a difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P.\u00a0wittmanniana to P.\u00a0corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new form, f. macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P.\u00a0corallina, P.\u00a0mlokosewitschii, P.\u00a0macrophylla, P.\u00a0wittmanniana, and introduced P.\u00a0wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P.\u00a0triternata and P.\u00a0corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P.\u00a0corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P.\u00a0wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P.\u00a0mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P.\u00a0corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P.\u00a0mlokosewitschii, P.\u00a0wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P.\u00a0tomentosa and the new P.\u00a0abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P.\u00a0mlokosewitschii \u2013 as part of the series Obovatae having orbicular, ovate or rarely pointed leaflets \u2013 and P.\u00a0triternata, P.\u00a0caucasica, P.\u00a0wittmanniana, P.\u00a0macrophylla, P.\u00a0tomentosa and P.\u00a0abchasica \u2013 all having rather wide, pointed leaflets \u2013 assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P.\u00a0daurica, P.\u00a0mlokosewitschii and P.\u00a0wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P.\u00a0kavachensis (= P.\u00a0caucasica), P.\u00a0mlokosewitschii (including P.\u00a0tomentosa) and P.\u00a0wittmanniana (including P.\u00a0abchasica). P.\u00a0wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P.\u00a0steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia-Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P.\u00a0abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P.\u00a0ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis."]}, {"page": "Golders Green Jewish Cemetery", "response": ["* Sir Frederick Claude Stern (1884\u20131967), botanist and horticulturalist, known for developing Highdown Gardens near Worthing, West Sussex"]}, {"page": "1956 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Colonel Frederick Claude Stern, .

Frederick Claude Stern assigned Cosson's variety to P. coriacea in 1943. It was elevated to P. corallina subsp. atlantica in part XI of Ren\u00e9 Maire's Flore de l'Afrique du Nord, published posthumously in 1964.
