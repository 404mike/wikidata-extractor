At the time he was managing director of a boot manufacturing business. Blindell overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 5,000 to win with a majority of 3,706.  His victory was the last Liberal by-election gain until Torrington in 1958.\nBlindell was re-elected as a Liberal at the 1929 general election, but in 1931 he was one of the Liberal MPs who broke with their party to support Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, eventually forming the National Liberal Party.\nHe was re-elected as a National Liberal at the 1931 general election and at the 1935 general election.  In both elections, the Conservatives (who also supported the National Government) did not field a candidate against him, and he was returned with large majorities.Blindell was knighted in 1936. He was killed in a car accident in 1937 in Stickford, near Spilsby, Lincolnshire. The car overturned when the driver swerved to avoid dogs in the road. Sir James died within five minutes of massive head injuries. Lady Blindell survived the accident with minor injuries.At the consequent 1937 Holland with Boston by-election, Herbert Butcher held the seat for the National Liberals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1937", "response": ["* May 10 \u2013 Sir James Blindell, British politician (b. 1884)"]}, {"page": "John Parker (Labour politician)", "response": ["He contested the seat of Holland with Boston in Lincolnshire in the 1931 general election, but the sitting National Liberal MP James Blindell was reelected."]}, {"page": "National Government (1935\u20131937)", "response": ["| James Blindell"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Sir James Blindell, Liberal and National Liberal MP 1929\u201337."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Blindell"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir James Blindell"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|James Blindell"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|James Blindell"]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["* James Blindell, Holland with Boston, 1929\u201331"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Blindell"]}, {"page": "List of National Liberal Party (UK, 1931) MPs", "response": ["| James Blindell || Holland with Boston || 1931 || 1937"]}, {"page": "Holland with Boston (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Sir James Blindell"]}, {"page": "1937 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 10 May \u2013 Sir James Blindell, politician (born 1884)"]}, {"page": "Herbert Butcher", "response": ["He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Holland with Boston at a by-election in June 1937, after the death of the National Liberal MP Sir James Blindell.
