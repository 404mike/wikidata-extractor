His woodcut illustrations \"often incorporated the swirling lines of Art Nouveau and androgynous figures\".

He was born in Kensington and grew up in Earl's Court in West London, but in 1902 the family moved to Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire. It was hoped the move to the countryside would help Caroline Nash, who was increasingly showing symptoms of mental illness. The growing cost of Caroline Nash's treatment led to the house at Iver Heath being rented out while Paul and his father lived together in lodgings and his younger sister and brother went to boarding schools. On Valentine's Day 1910, aged forty-nine, Caroline Nash died in a mental institution. Paul Nash was originally intended for a career in the navy, following the path of his maternal grandfather, but despite additional training at a specialist school in Greenwich, he failed the Naval Entrance Examination and returned to finish his schooling at St Paul's School. Encouraged by a fellow student at St Paul's, Eric Kennington, Nash considered the possibility of a career as an artist. After studying for a year at the South-Western Polytechnic in Chelsea, he then enrolled at the London County Council School of Photo-engraving and Lithography, in Bolt Court off Fleet Street, in the autumn of 1908. Nash spent two years studying at Bolt Court, where he began to write poetry and plays and where his work was spotted and praised by Selwyn Image. He was advised by his friend, the poet Gordon Bottomley, and by the artist William Rothenstein, that he should attend the Slade School of Art at University College, London. He enrolled in October 1910, though he later recorded that on his first meeting with the Professor of Drawing, Henry Tonks, 'It was evident he considered that neither the Slade, nor I, were likely to derive much benefit'."]}, {"page": "Oxford period poetry anthologies", "response": ["Lascelles Abercrombie \u2013 Percy Addleshaw \u2013 Douglas Ainslie \u2013 Thomas Bailie Aldrich \u2013 William Alexander \u2013 William Allingham \u2013 Sir Edwin Arnold \u2013 Matthew Arnold \u2013 Thomas Ashe \u2013 Alfred Austin \u2013 William Edmonstoune Aytoun \u2013 Philip James Bailey \u2013 Richard Harris Barham \u2013 Maurice Baring \u2013 George Barlow \u2013 Jane Barlow \u2013 William Barnes \u2013 Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield \u2013 Thomas Lovell Beddoes \u2013 Henry Charles Beeching \u2013 Charles Dent Bell \u2013 Hilaire Belloc \u2013 Arthur Christopher Benson \u2013 Laurence Binyon \u2013 John Stuart Blackie \u2013 Richard Doddridge Blackmore \u2013 Mathilde Blind \u2013 Wilfrid Scawen Blunt \u2013 George Henry Boker \u2013 Gordon Bottomley \u2013 Francis William Bourdillon \u2013 Robert Bridges \u2013 Emily Bront\u00eb \u2013 Rupert Brooke \u2013 Robert Barnabas Brough \u2013 Oliver Madox Brown \u2013 Thomas Edward Brown \u2013 Elizabeth Barrett Browning \u2013 Robert Browning \u2013 William Cullen Bryant \u2013 Robert Buchanan \u2013 Arthur Gray Butler \u2013 Wathen Mark Wilks Call \u2013 Thomas Carlyle \u2013 Bliss Carman \u2013 John Clare \u2013 Caroline Clive \u2013 Arthur Hugh Clough \u2013 Hartley Coleridge \u2013 Mary E.
