The first result was a translation of the Song of Songs, with a historical and critical commentary, published in 1857.

He points out, among other things, that Baer has indicated the open and closed sections in the Prophets and the Hagiographa, a thing not usually done in Masoretic manuscripts (pp.\u00a010 et seq.); that he has introduced a number of anti-Masoretic pauses (p.\u00a029); that his division of the Sedarim is faulty (p.\u00a041); that he has introduced the dagesh into the first letter of words when the preceding word ends with the same letter (p.\u00a0117), as well as the dagesh which follows upon a guttural with silent shewa and a \u1e25atef-pata\u1e25 under the first of two similar letters (pp.\u00a0466, 662), all of which are not warranted by the best manuscripts.
