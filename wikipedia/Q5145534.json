Following that start Mick Buxton made an inspired signing, the Liverpool striker Colin Russell. He scored two goals on his debut in Town's 2-0 win over Oxford United, which was followed by a 6-0 thrashing of Orient. Then, following a 3-game mini-blip, Town went on a run of 7 wins in a row. During that run, Mark Lillis scored 9 goals in 4 games, including 4 against Cardiff City.", "As that run was winding down, Town also managed a sensational 1-0 win at Leeds United in the League Cup third round, in which David Cowling scored the famous header that knocked Town's rivals. They also gave a good thrashing to their other rivals Bradford City on New Year's Day, by beating them 6-3, in which Brian Stanton scored 4 times. Town's home form along with the goalscoring abilities of Mark Lillis, Colin Russell and Brian Stanton gave Town their only season in their history in which they didn't lose a single home game in any competition.", "|Colin Russell||||FW||41||16||4||0||4||1||49||17"]}, {"page": "Colin Russell", "response": ["Colin Russell may refer to:", "*Colin Russell (EastEnders), character in EastEnders", "*Colin Russell (swimmer) (born 1984), Canadian swimmer", "*Colin Russell (footballer) (born 1961), English former footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Colin Russell||||1982\u20131984||64 (2)||23||4 (1)||0||10||2||0||0||0||0||78 (3)||25"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Colin Russell"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["*  Colin Russell"]}]}}
