In common with most of the survey ships of the period, she was named after an influential surveyor or explorer of the Royal Navy. In her case, this was the nineteenth century surveyor Alexander Thomas Emeric Vidal, who had surveyed much of the coast of Africa, and ranged into the Atlantic to survey the tiny islet of Rockall.  So far she has been the only ship of the Navy to bear the name."]}, {"page": "Emeric Essex Vidal", "response": ["The Vidal brothers were physically small but all three pursued naval careers in the Napoleonic wars and afterwards.

Surveys by the Royal Navy in 1824, 1827, and 1829 failed to locate the rock, until a final extensive six week survey in 1840 using two brigs led to the conclusion that the rock had never existed. Captain Alexander Thomas Emeric Vidal, who led the final survey, noted that such false sightings were likely due to floating debris or whales."]}]}}
