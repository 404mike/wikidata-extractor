Like others, they \"treated a narrow range of subjects with a dour earnestness\", according to Antony Griffiths.Griffiths, 69 Myra Kathleen Hughes and William Strang were other leading figures. Many artists turned to illustrating books, usually with lithographs.  In America, Stephen Parrish, Otto Bacher, Henry Farrer, and Robert Swain Gifford might be considered the important figures at the turn of the century, though they were mostly less exclusively dedicated to printmaking than the English artists.
