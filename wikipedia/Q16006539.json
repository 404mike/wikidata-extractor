In the 1920s a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station). But it quickly reached capacity by the 1930s due to major population growth of Toronto and its surrounding region. In 1937 the Postmaster General appealed to the Minister of Public Works to approve a new replacement facility at the corner of Bay & Fleet Street (now Lake Shore Boulevard). Approval was granted by the federal Department of Public Works in part to stimulate the depression impacted construction industry. Design and construction of the warehouse built with steel & concrete would begin in 1938. Designed by Charles B. Dolphin, it's a building that incorporates a combination of Art Deco and Art Moderne architectural style. The original building would be built for around $2 million (CAD) [$35 million 2020],  The building was strategically located south of Union Station and was connected directly to the train platforms via an underground tunnel. Trains would be able to directly unload mail and move it directly to the mail sorting centre.

However, actual platform signs still show \"Bloor\" on the Yonge\u2013University line and \"Yonge\" on the Bloor\u2013Danforth line, following a naming style common in New York subway station complexes, where only the platform's cross street is shown on the platform signs."]}, {"page": "William McBrien Building", "response": ["William McBrien Building (formally known as the W.
