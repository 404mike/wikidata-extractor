She is rude and immature, and dismisses everyone around her as being boring or stupid. She is completely ignorant of Northern Irish history and politics despite working for Sinn Fein with her mother Elisha McCallion. She enrolled as a student at Queen's despite being on furlough from her present job. Uncle Andy is convinced that she is his daughter from a one night stand with her mother, but she is unaware of this. She is initially terrified by Uncle Andy's attempts to bond with her, but they develop a reluctant friendship. Even though she acts dumb, she often demonstrates that she is highly intelligent and well connected. One example is when she figures out how Uncle Andy can save the Loyalist Kneebreakers Social Club from being demolished after first learning about the situation hours before it was due to happen. Even though all of her classes have been online (due to government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic), she has become a major influencer among Catholic students. Being from Derry, she is the only main character not to be from the greater Belfast area."]}, {"page": "Glenn Barr", "response": ["Barr died at Altnagelvin hospital on 24 October 2017 at the age of 75.
