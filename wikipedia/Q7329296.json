This was the same day that Swansea were playing Llanelli at Neath in a semi-final cup-tie thus depriving Wales of several players. This was Wales's first international, organised before the Welsh Rugby Union was set up. The players had never played together before, though one player, Major Richard Summers, was selected for Wales on his performances a couple of years earlier for his school, Cheltenham College, in matches against Cardiff and Newport. No formal invitations to play were sent out to the Welsh XV. Two of those expected to appear did not turn up, so bystanders, university undergraduates with tenuous Welsh links who had travelled to London to see the match, were called in to play for Wales."]}, {"page": "1880\u201381 Home Nations rugby union matches", "response": ["Wales: Charlie Newman (Newport), Richard Summers (Haverfordwest), James Bevan (Cambridge Uni. and Newport) capt., Edward Peake (Newport and Chepstow), Leonard Watkins (Llandaff and Cardiff), Edward John Lewis (Llandovery College), Barry Girling (Cardiff), Aneurin Rees (Llandovery College), Frank Purdon (Swansea) B.
