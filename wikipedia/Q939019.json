Many long-standing DJs, such as Simon Bates, Dave Lee Travis, Alan Freeman, Bob Harris, Paul Gambaccini, Gary Davies, and later Steve Wright, Bruno Brookes and Johnnie Walker left the station or were dismissed, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was dropped from the daytime playlist.", "Many DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as Johnnie Walker, Bob Harris and Steve Wright) have joined Radio 2 which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s."]}, {"page": "Alice Cooper", "response": ["During an interview with Johnnie Walker on BBC Radio 2 in September 2007, Cooper said that he was not a Christian when he gave up drinking, but stated that he thanks God for \"taking it away\", saying, \"I mean if He [God] can part the Red Sea and create the universe, He can certainly take alcoholism away from somebody.\" Although he originally did not speak publicly about his religious beliefs, Cooper was later vocal about his faith as a born-again Christian."]}, {"page": "Gene Vincent", "response": ["His final US recordings were four tracks for Rockin' Ronny Weiser's Rolling Rock label, a few weeks before his death.

The data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post.
