Jackson was the Chairman of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission between 1983 and 2000, and subsequently became chairman emeritus. He was a world-renowned tiger conservationist who was involved in tiger research and conservation efforts from the late 1960s.Jackson worked with Reuters and was the chief correspondent for the India bureau from 1954 to 1960 and from 1962 to 1970. His interest in tigers arose during 18 years in India as a news correspondent, which led to work with WWF International, Operation Tiger, India's Project Tiger, and conservation programs in Nepal, Thailand and Indonesia. \nPeter Jackson co-authored and co-edited several publications on big cats and tigers, including Tiger! (1994) with Simon Barnes, Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan, compiled and edited by Kristin Nowell and Peter Jackson (IUCN 1996), and Riding the Tiger: Tiger Conservation in Human Dominated Landscapes (Cambridge University Press 1999).Jackson initially worked independently to promote tiger conservation. In 1983 he became the Chair of the Cat Specialist Group. He held this position for 17 years. In 2004 a newly established subspecies of the tiger, Malayan tiger, was given a name Panthera tigris jacksoni in honour of Peter Jackson.Jackson died on 8 December 2016 at the age of 90.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malayan tiger", "response": ["When the tiger population of the Malay Peninsula was accepted as a distinct subspecies in 2004, the chairman of the Malaysian Association of Zoos, Parks and Aquaria argued that the new subspecies should be named Panthera tigris malayensis to reflect the geographical region of its range. As a compromise, it received the vernacular name \"Malayan tiger\", and the scientific name jacksoni, which honours the tiger conservationist Peter Jackson. Nevertheless, P. t. malayensis was used by other authors."]}, {"page": "Peter Jackson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Peter Jackson (born 1961) is a New Zealand-born filmmaker.", "Peter Jackson may also refer to:", "*Peter Jackson (academic), Australian writer and scholar of sexual politics and Buddhism in Thailand", "*Peter Jackson (scientist) (1949\u20132011), scientist at Thomson Reuters Corporation", "*Peter Jackson (historian), scholar and author on the history of the Crusades, particularly regarding the Mongols", "*Peter Jackson (conservationist) (1926\u20132016), British journalist, photographer, tiger conservationist, and author", "*Peter Jackson (geographer) (born 1955), human geographer", "*Peter Jackson, Member of Parliament (MP) for City of York", "*Peter Jackson (judge) (born 1955), English Court of Appeal judge", "*Peter Jackson (politician) (1928\u20132020), British Labour Party Member of Parliament for High Peak 1966\u20131970", "*Peter Jackson (boxer) (1861\u20131901), World Colored Heavyweight Champion boxer also known as \"Peter the Great\"", "*Young Peter Jackson (boxer, born 1877) (1877\u20131923), African American welterweight boxer known as \"The Baltimore Demon\"", "*Young Peter Jackson (boxer, born 1912) (1912\u20131979), African American lightweight boxer", "*Peter Jackson (cricketer) (1911\u20131999), English cricketer who played for Worcestershire", "*Peter Jackson (footballer, born 1905) (1905\u20131986), English footballer and football manager", "*Peter Jackson (footballer, born 1937) (1937\u20131991), his son, English footballer", "*Peter Jackson (footballer, born 1961) (born 1961), English footballer and football manager", "*Peter Jackson (rugby league) (1964\u20131997), Australian rugby league footballer", "*Peter Jackson (rugby union) (1930\u20132004), English rugby union footballer", "*Peter Jackson (sailor) (born 1945), sailor for the United States Virgin Islands", "*Peter Jackson (table tennis) (born 1964), New Zealand table tennis player", "*Peter Jackson (tennis) (1934\u20132014), Irish tennis player", "*Peter Jackson, a fictional character in the Stephen King novels Desperation and The Regulators", "*Peter Jackson, a fictional character in the 1969 Michael Crichton novel The Andromeda Strain", "*Peter Jackson, Cigar Merchant, a 1919 novel by Gilbert Frankau", "*Peter Jackson, a pseudonym for Ernest Hemingway during his second stay in Toronto", "*Peter Jackson (artist) (1922\u20132003), artist who ran a documentary cartoon strip in the London Evening News, giving glimpses of London's history", "*Peter Jackson (journalist) (born 1950), American journalist", "*Peter Jackson (fashion designer) (1928\u20132008), Australian men's fashion outfitter and fashion designer", "*Peter Jackson, a brand of cigarettes owned by Imperial Tobacco", "*Peter Jackson (businessman) (born 1975), CEO of Paddy Power Betfair"]}, {"page": "Peter Jackson (mammalogist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Jackson (conservationist)"]}, {"page": "Peter Jackson (biologist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Jackson (conservationist)"]}]}}
