In 1923, he moved to Arsenal, and in his eight years with Arsenal became one of the club's most successful goalscorers. After a year in the reserve side, Brain started his Arsenal first-team career with a goal on his debut, a 1\u20130 win against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 25 October 1924.\nBrain was a prolific striker throughout his career, and was the club's top scorer for four seasons in a row, from 1924\u201325 to 1928\u201329; this included 39 goals in the 1925\u201326 season (second only to Ted Drake's haul of 45 in 1934\u201335), which included four hat tricks. The next season, 1926\u201327, Brain scored 34 goals, this haul including two four-goal tallies against Sheffield Wednesday and Burnley. Brain's goalscoring feats helped Arsenal reach their first FA Cup final, in 1926\u201327, though a mistake by goalkeeper Dan Lewis meant Arsenal lost 1\u20130 to Cardiff City.\nHowever Brain's form dropped and in 1929\u201330 he lost out in competing for the front spot with Jack Lambert, David Jack and Dave Halliday all getting the nod ahead of him, meaning Brain only played six league matches this season. Brain therefore missed Arsenal' 1930 Cup final win over Huddersfield Town; Jack and Lambert led the line that day. He played in Arsenal's 2\u20131 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930. The following season, 1930\u201331, Brain finally won a medal after playing sixteen matches (scoring four goals) in Arsenal's very first First Division title-winning season. Brain's final appearance in an Arsenal shirt was a 2\u20130 win over Sheffield Wednesday on 21 March 1931.\nBy now, Brain's age was catching up with him, and he had been overtaken in the goalscoring stakes by both Lambert and Jack. He left Arsenal for Tottenham for \u00a32,500 in September 1931, becoming one of the few players to have moved directly between the two rival clubs. In total, he scored 139 goals in 232 appearances for Arsenal, making him Arsenal' joint-fifth top scorer of all time, and he was the first player ever to score 100 goals for the club, a feat he achieved in a 6\u20133 win over Liverpool on 7 March 1928. However, he never played for England; he managed to secure a trial for the national team but was never actually selected.\nBy the time Brain had joined Spurs he was in his thirties, and only played 47 times for them, scoring 10 goals, before leaving in 1934. He played his final years out at Swansea Town and Bristol City. After retiring as a player, Brain managed first King's Lynn and then Cheltenham Town from 1939 until 1948. During the war Brain briefly turned out for Cheltenham Town. He returned to is role as Cheltenham Town manager until 1948, after which he retired completely from football. He died in 1971, at the age of 71.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1900", "response": ["* September 11 \u2013 Jimmy Brain, English footballer (d. 1971)"]}, {"page": "Ian Wright", "response": ["Wright scored 185 goals from 288 appearances (279 starts) for Arsenal, and scored eleven hat-tricks for them, a total surpassed only by Jimmy Brain and Jack Lambert. , he is Arsenal's second highest goalscorer of all time, behind Thierry Henry who broke his record in 2005.

It proved to be an early dawn for Arsenal, who spent most of the rest of the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, outlining a five-year plan for success.Soar & Tyler, p. 48. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era \u2013 Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions \u2013 and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Ted Drake", "response": ["Despite being injured regularly (he was a doubt up until the last minute for the 1936 Cup Final), Drake's speed, fierce shooting and brave playing style meant he was Arsenal's first-choice centre forward for the rest of the decade, and he was the club's top scorer for each of the five seasons from 1934\u201335 to 1938\u201339. The Second World War curtailed Drake's career, although he served in the Royal Air Force as well as turning out for Arsenal in wartime games and also appearing as a guest player for West Ham United later in World War II. However, Drake's career would not last long into peacetime; a spinal injury incurred in a game against Reading in 1945 forced him to retire from playing. With 139 goals in 184 games, he is along with Jimmy Brain the joint-fifth all-time scorer for Arsenal."]}, {"page": "Leslie Knighton", "response": ["Despite Norris's interfering, Knighton, thanks to an informal scouting system of his friends and former colleagues in the North, signed several high-quality players for Arsenal; these included Bob John, Jimmy Brain and Alf Baker, all of whom would be part of Arsenal's trophy-winning side of the early 1930s. However, he could never knit together a solid winning side and Arsenal's performances gradually declined towards the end of his tenure; they finished 19th in 1923-24 and 20th in 1924-25."]}, {"page": "Jack Lambert (footballer, born 1902)", "response": ["By now Lambert was over 30 and only a bit-part player. Ernie Coleman had led the line through most of 1932\u201333, and the signing of Jimmy Dunne in September 1933 forced Lambert out of the side. He played his last game on 13 September against West Bromwich Albion, and in October he was sold to Fulham. In all he scored 109 goals in 161 games for the Gunners, and equalled Jimmy Brain's record of 12 hat-tricks for the club."]}, {"page": "North London derby", "response": ["|align=left|Jimmy Brain||FW"]}, {"page": "Harry Woods (footballer)", "response": ["Woods served in the Tank Corps in France during the war, and finally began his Football League career with South Shields, then in the Second Division, in August 1919.

Woods failed to settle at St James' Park, however, managing just two goals in 16 appearances before he joined Arsenal on 25 August 1923. He scored ten goals in his first season, helping the Gunners to narrowly avoid relegation, but after Jimmy Brain made his first-team debut in October 1924 and established himself in the side, Woods' opportunities were limited. The team's form improved dramatically after Herbert Chapman was appointed manager in 1925, but Woods played only three times under him, and left for Luton Town in August 1926, where he scored 27 goals in 105 games.

Arsenal had just missed out on promotion on goal average to the First Division, and in 1914\u201315 King spearheaded their attack, scoring 26 goals in the League and another three in  the FA Cup. These included the first hat trick scored at their new Highbury stadium (against Grimsby Town on 14 November 1914), and two four-goal hauls against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Nottingham Forest. King's 29 goals that season were an all-time club record at the time, remaining so until Jimmy Brain broke it in 1925\u201326. However, Arsenal's defence let them down and they only finished fifth, outside of the promotion places; eventually, they were re-elected back to the First Division when football resumed after the end of the First World War."]}, {"page": "1900 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 September \u2013 Jimmy Brain, footballer (died 1971)"]}, {"page": "1927 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Arsenal were drawn against a First Division opponent in the third round, meeting Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Both teams scored early in the match, and three goals came in the space of six minutes. The first was the result of a scramble which ended when Jimmy Brain headed the ball into the net for Arsenal. United equalised through a header by Harry Johnson, but Arsenal went ahead once more after a goal by Charlie Buchan. David Mercer equalised again for Sheffield after 40 minutes, to keep the scores level going into half-time. Joe Hulme scored the winning goal for Arsenal in the 60th minute.", "| || Jimmy Brain"]}]}}
