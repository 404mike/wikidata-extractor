In the late 1930s with war a possibility and the likely event of him being called to arms, Lock decided that he would prefer to fight as an airman. He joined the RAF in 1939. He completed his training in 1940 and was posted to No. 41 Squadron RAF in time for the Battle of Britain. Lock became the RAF's most successful Allied pilot during the battle, shooting down 21 German aircraft and sharing in the destruction of one.After the Battle of Britain Lock served on the Channel Front, flying offensive sweeps over France. Lock went on to bring his overall total to 26 aerial victories, one shared destroyed and eight probable in 25 weeks of operational sorties over a one-year period, during which time he was hospitalised for six months. Included in his victory total were 20 German fighter aircraft, 18 of them Messerschmitt Bf 109s. In mid-1941 Lock was promoted to the rank of flight lieutenant.\nLock earned the nickname \"Sawn Off Lockie\", because of his extremely short stature. Within less than six months of becoming one of the most famous RAF pilots in the country, he crash-landed in the English Channel after his Supermarine Spitfire was damaged by ground-fire. Lock was posted missing in action. He was never seen again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Guinea Pig Club", "response": ["*Eric Lock  (1919\u20131941)"]}, {"page": "Johnnie Johnson (RAF officer)", "response": ["Johnson flew various operations over France including the Rhubarb ground attack missions which Johnson hated\u2014he considered it a waste of pilots. Several successful fighter pilots had been lost this way. Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock and Wing Commander Paddy Finucane were killed on Rhubarb operations in August 1941 and July 1942 respectively. Squadron leader Robert Stanford Tuck would be captured carrying out a similar operation in January 1942. During this time, Dundas and other pilots also expressed dissatisfaction with the formation tactics being used in the wing. After a long conversation into the early hours, Bader accepted the suggestions by his senior pilots and agreed to the use of more flexible tactics to lessen the chances of being taken by surprise. The tactical changes involved operating overlapping line abreast formations similar to the German finger-four formation. The tactics were used thereafter by all RAF pilots in the wing."]}, {"page": "The Few", "response": ["|Flt Lt Eric Lock"]}, {"page": "No. 41 Squadron RAF", "response": ["* Pilot Officer Eric Lock joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in February 1939 and was posted to 41 Squadron as his first operational unit, in mid-June 1940. Lock's first operational sortie took place on 9 August 1940, which was uneventful, as was his second a few days later. However, between 15 August and 17 November 1940, Lock claimed no less than 22 aircraft destroyed, and he became the most successful RAF pilot of the Battle of Britain and the equal second highest-scoring pilot in the RAF at the time. Over the three consecutive months of September, October and November 1940, Lock was awarded a DFC, a Bar, and a DSO. On the afternoon of 5 September 1940, 41 Squadron's most intensive day of the Battle of Britain, Lock claimed three victories in a single sortie. The aircraft he flew that day, Spitfire Ia, N3162, EB-G, is recognised by 41 Squadron, which has the letters EB-G on one of their Typhoons, and by the BBMF, which has EB-G emblazoned on their Spitfire P7350. Lock was seriously wounded in action on 17 November 1940, and underwent multiple operations, which included three skin grafts at the hands of Dr. Archibald McIndoe at East Grinstead. Following seven months\u2019 recuperation, he returned to operations with 611 Squadron in late June 1941. During July 1941, he added another three victories to his already impressive list, but on 3 August, he failed to return from a routine operation after attacking a German column on a road behind Boulogne. In recognition of his achievements and status in Battle of Britain history, he is remembered on several memorials and in his hometown of Bayston Hill, outside Shrewsbury, where a street is named after him. He remains today one of the RAF's top ten Aces of World War II, credited with some 25 aircraft destroyed and 7 probably destroyed, all bar three of which he achieved on 41 Squadron.Shores, Christopher (1983).

German tactics changed through the month but achieved little military gain. On 7 October, 5. and 9./JG\u00a027 carrying bombs attacked targets in southern England. Four were shot down, two from each unit. Their assailants from 606 and 501 suffered one pilot killed in the latter unit. On day 11 One pilot was rescued after being shot down by 41 Squadron's Eric Lock, and single losses were reported on the 15th and 22nd. The Blitz and ensuing fighter sweeps over England in the last few months of 1940 could not dent British defences or ultimately the country's war effort. I.

III./JG\u00a027 commanded by Max Dobislav, who succeeded Schlichting after his capture on 7 September, left their base at Gu\u00eenes on 10 November. The Gruppe were based at Gu\u00eenes throughout September and had lost two pilots captured and one missing in the final month; they claimed five enemy aircraft. The two captured men were the only Staffelkapit\u00e4ne lost by JG\u00a027 in the battle. One day after the official end to the Battle of Britain, Lippert achieved arguably the most notable victory of the wing when he shot down the leading RAF ace Archie McKellar. III./JG\u00a027 moved to Vechta in Germany, while Detmold. I./JG\u00a027 was dispatched to Dinan in northwestern France on 21 October, after resting at Stade near Hamburg from 1 October.

In the evening the Wing crossed out over RAF Manston at 18,000\u00a0ft and then dropped to 13,000\u00a0ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint-Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf\u00a0109Fs were sighted one thousand feet above and in front travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf\u00a0109 into cloud while following the Bf\u00a0109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another burst from 200 yards the Bf\u00a0109 burst into flames. He sighted another formation of 18 Bf\u00a0109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the tail unit of one which went down vertically and into a cloud layer at 2,000\u00a0ft at which point contact was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. The operation elevated his tally to 7.

On 10 July another Knight's Cross holder, Rolf Pingel, commanding II. Gruppe pursued a Short Stirling to the English coast, was hit and force-landed and promptly captured. His aircraft became the first Bf\u00a0109\u00a0F to be captured intact by the British. Fighter Command persisted with large-scale operations, but were suffering heavy casualties from the two German fighter wings. Eric Lock was among the casualties, posted missing on 3 August after strafing sortie (presumably ground-fire was the cause) and on 9 August Wing Commander Douglas Bader baled out and was captured. Galland entertained the famous pilot at JG\u00a026 headquarters. The cause of Bader's capture occurred in the midst of combat with III. Gruppe commanded by Sch\u00f6pfel. Galland, went through every report, even those of German pilots killed in the action, to determine Bader's victor. Each case was dismissed. RAF combat records indicate Bader may have been shot down by Flight Lieutenant \"Buck\" Casson of No. 616 Squadron RAF, who claimed a Bf\u00a0109 whose tail came off and the pilot  out, before he himself was shot down and captured by Sch\u00f6pfel.
