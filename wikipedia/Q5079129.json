He designed and constructed a small monoplane between 1907\u201309 at Maindy in Cardiff and claimed he flew the plane over short distances in 1910, followed by longer flights later, although none of these claims have official verification. As William Frost's own flight at Saundersfoot in 1896 was never officially recorded, then Watkins effort may have been the first official heavier-than-air flight in Wales. The plane is now preserved at the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gustav Hamel", "response": ["In March 1914 Hamel flew to Cardiff to give a public flying display.
