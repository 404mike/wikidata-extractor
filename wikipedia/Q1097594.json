The next day, he was named in the Championship Team of the Week for his performance in the opening day victory over Peterborough United. Later that month, Savage was renamed as Captain of Derby County, replacing Paul Connolly, who manager Nigel Clough wanted to \"concentrate on his own game\". In response, Savage said that: \"I did not deserve the captaincy when I first came to the club. I was handed it from the first day and I shouldn't have been. It was too much pressure for me and I had a nightmare. I let it get to me. I think I'm ready for it now. I feel more comfortable with it now.\" Derby struggled once again during the season, not achieving safety until the 44th fixture, but the season was a personal success for Savage as he appeared in all but one of Derby's 51 league and cup fixtures during the campaign, the match which he missed being due to suspension, starting 49 of them. He also scored twice; a free kick against Queens Park Rangers in a 4\u20132 home defeat and a volley at Sheffield United in a 1\u20131 draw.

He made his 100th career league appearance in a 5\u20130 win over Crystal Palace on 25 September 2010 but sustained a hamstring injury which ruled him out for several weeks. He returned to the first team ahead of schedule on 16 October 2010, reuniting with Barker at the heart of the Derby defence as they ran out 3\u20130 winners over Preston North End. Leacock held his place in the team over the next two months but came in for severe criticism from Derby manager Nigel Clough after his performance in a 5\u20132 defeat by local rivals Nottingham Forest. After this, Leacock made only three starts over the next 12 months before it was announced that had left the club by mutual concent and was set to sign for League One side Leyton Orient."]}, {"page": "Russell Anderson", "response": ["On 15 January 2010, Derby County announced that they had signed Anderson on a contract until the end of the 2009\u201310 season.

He finally made his first start for the club in a 2\u20132 draw with Middlesbrough on 16 March, in place of Buxton, and kept it for the rest of the season as Derby successfully fought off relegation. Anderson scored his first goal for Derby County, and his first in three years, on 17 April 2010 with the opener in a 1\u20131 draw against Crystal Palace which ensured Derby were mathematically safe from relegation. Anderson impressed enough for Derby manager Nigel Clough to confirm his intention to offer Anderson a two-year deal at the end of the 2009\u201310 season, seeing Anderson as one of four centre halves for the club's 2010\u201311 season alongside Barker, Buxton and Dean Leacock.

However, a sharp decline in form from November onwards, coupled with a season-ending injury to Shaun Barker, allowed Buxton the opportunity to cement a place in the Derby starting eleven and he appeared in the majority of Derby's fixtures from November onwards. He even earned cult status amongst the Derby support with a stoppage-time winner in the East Midlands derby at home to Nottingham Forest to earn Derby a first league double over their archrivals in 40 years. Buxton was eventually rewarded with a two-year extension to his contract, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2014.", "Despite losing his squad number of 5, Buxton was considered to be the first choice centre back for 2013\u201314, as Shaun Barker and Mark O'Brien were still recovering from knee injuries.", "On 30 June 2014, Jake Buxton signed a new three-year contract with Derby County, which would see him stay at the club until the end of the 2016/17 season.

He was also the Rams captain for the game and won man of the match. Derby enjoyed their best start to a season for over 100 years, winning their first four games, and were in the top three going into the start of the October international break. Shackell proved key to this success and his early season form was rewarded with a nomination for the Championship Player of the Month award, though he eventually lost out to Middlesbrough's Matthew Bates. Shackell started every game of the 2011\u201312 season at centre back and became captain of the team after Shaun Barker was injured in the 1\u20130 win against Nottingham Forest in mid-March 2012. Shackell was an ever-present in the Derby County side during the season and was runner up in the fans Player of the Season vote.
