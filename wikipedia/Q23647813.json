He played in the FA Cup for Sunderland, and was on the books of Hartlepools United without playing league football for them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Poulter", "response": ["*Harry Poulter, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Paddy Wrightson", "response": ["With the transfer deadline approaching, the Western Morning News commented that \"Throughout the season Wrightson has played consistently well, and has been the principal schemer of the City's danger moves. His shooting has been attended with marked success, and to date he heads the Exeter scorers with fifteen goals to his credit.\" They also expressed concern that, if interest from other clubs in Wrightson and fellow goalscorer Harry Poulter resulted in a serious offer for their services, the directors might make the mistake of accepting, which \"would strike a heavy blow to Exeter City's prestige, and would probably result in a serious deterioration in the team's standard of play\", thus potentially reducing attendances. He finished his Exeter career with 71 league appearances and 25 goals, most of which were scored in the 1934\u201335 season. He was included on Exeter's retained list but would not accept the terms offered, and at the end of May was placed on the transfer list."]}]}}
