It should be different. It should be authentic and real ... and appealing to women.\" When asked about the decision to give the Amazons heeled sandals, Jenkins explained that they also have flats for fighting, adding \"It's total wish-fulfillment ... I, as a woman, want Wonder Woman to be sexy, hot as hell, fight badass, and look great at the same time ... the same way men want Superman to have ridiculously huge pecs and an impractically big body.

Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restrictive of full head movement. Costume designer Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed \"Cape Town\", a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London. The Batsuit's basic design was a neoprene undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.", "| Best Costume Design for a Fantasy Film \u2013 Lindy Hemming", "| Best Costume \u2013 Lindy Hemming", "| Best Costume \u2013 Lindy Hemming"]}, {"page": "Saturn Award for Best Costume Design", "response": ["| Lindy Hemming", "| Lindy Hemming", "| Lindy Hemming", "| Lindy Hemming", "* Lindy Hemming"]}, {"page": "72nd Academy Awards", "response": ["* Topsy-Turvy\u00a0\u2013 Lindy Hemming"]}, {"page": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)", "response": ["Lindy Hemming was the costume designer for Chamber of Secrets.

Nolan noted, \"We gave a Francis Bacon spin to [his face]. This corruption, this decay in the texture of the look itself. It's grubby.
