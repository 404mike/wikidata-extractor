At various points in his life he attended the Tabernacle Chapel, which had been founded by the preacher George Whitefield, the Union Chapel in Islington, and later a Congregationalist chapel in Stoke Newington. He was a congregant of the Tabernacle for over fifty years, and was credited with establishing its Sabbath school for children. In 1816 he was one of the founding committee members of the Peace Society and served as the society's treasurer for many years. His position within the city brought him into contact with other like-minded Christians and abolitionists such as Thomas Clarkson, William Wilberforce and the reformed slaver John Newton, for whose last will and testament Scott was an executor; Newton had been the Rector of St Mary Woolnoth just a stone's throw from where the bank was based in Bartholomew Lane. Through his work with the bank and friendship with the Thornton family, Scott was also affiliated to some degree with the aims of the Clapham Sect and is mentioned in the letters of Marianne Thornton. He was involved with a number of other strongly active Christian organisations such as the Hibernian Society, the Continental Society, the Canada Education Society, and the Newport Pagnell Evangelical Institution which had been established by William Bull to train evangelical clergy for dissenting churches.
