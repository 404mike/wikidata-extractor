Born to the London painter William Collins and his wife, he moved with the family to Italy when he was twelve, living there and in France for two years and learning Italian and French. He worked initially as a tea merchant. After publishing Antonina, his first novel, in 1850, Collins met Charles Dickens, who became a friend and mentor. Some Collins work first appeared in Dickens's journals Household Words and All the Year Round. They also collaborated on drama and fiction. Collins gained financial stability and an international following by the 1860s, but began to suffer from gout and became addicted to the opium he took for the pain, so that his health and writing quality declined in the 1870s and 1880s. Collins was critical of the institution of marriage: he split his time between widow Caroline Graves \u2013 living with her for most of his adult life, treating her daughter as his \u2013 and the younger Martha Rudd, by whom he had three children.", "Collins was born at 11 New Cavendish Street, Marylebone, London, the son of William Collins, a well-known Royal Academician landscape painter, and his wife, Harriet Geddes. Named after his father, he was soon known by his middle name, which honoured his godfather, David Wilkie. The family moved to Pond Street, Hampstead, in 1826. In 1828 Collins's brother Charles Allston Collins was born. Between 1829 and 1830, the Collins family moved twice, first to Hampstead Square and then to Porchester Terrace, Bayswater. Wilkie and Charles received their early education from their mother at home. The Collins family were deeply religious, and Collins's mother enforced strict church attendance on her sons, which Wilkie disliked.", "William Collins had intended his first son to become a clergyman and was disappointed in his son's lack of interest. In 1846 the young man instead entered Lincoln's Inn to study law, initiated by his father, who wanted him to have a steady income. Collins showed only a slight interest in law and spent most of his time with friends and on working on a second novel, Antonina, or the Fall of Rome. After his father's death in 1847, Collins produced his first published book, Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq., R. A., published in 1848.

On the completion of his education at Norwich School in 1811, he was apprenticed to John Crome, whose influence on his pupil was profound. His work was exhibited in London as early as 1811 and at the British Institution from 1814\u201318. In 1814 he moved away from Norwich to London, where he befriended the artist William Collins. In 1819 ill health forced him to return to Norwich, where lived for twenty years, before moving to Windsor in 1840, where he continued to produce landscapes. He returned to London in 1849, residing there until his death in 1859 at the age of 64. He is buried in the Rosary Cemetery in Norwich. ", "In 1814, following the end of his Norwich apprenticeship, Stark moved to London. There he befriended and became influenced by the artist William Collins. In 1817 he became a student at the Royal Academy. The Bathing Place, Morning was sold in 1817 to the Henry Hobart, the Dean of Windsor. For a short period he shared lodgings with the portrait painter Joseph Clover. During this period he began to sell paintings to wealthy patrons: both the Marquis of Stafford and the Countess de Grey bought works from him.", "By the mid-1830s, Stark had moved away from the influence of the Dutch masters and was producing paintings that showed nature less heavily and more freely. These works have more descriptive titles. Not all his critics were pleased: the Norfolk Chronicle complained in 1829 of Stark's move away from depicting formulaic scenes towards a greater use of bright colours and more brilliant lighting effects. His work during this period in his artistic career became more successful, according to Hemingway. The numerous sketches of the Norfolk countryside he had previously produced gave his exhibited works a freshness that was previously lacking, and which was more appealing to the critics. Cromer, exhibited at the British Institution in 1837, is a good example of this new kind of work, and shows the influence of his friend William Collins and the Norwich artist John Thirtle. Like many of his later works, it is based on earlier sketchwork."]}, {"page": "1847 in art", "response": ["* February 17 \u2013 William Collins, English painter (born 1788)"]}, {"page": "Collins (surname)", "response": ["*William Collins, one of several people including:", "**William Collins (Roundhead), English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1654 to 1659", "**William Collins (poet) (1721\u20131759), English poet", "**William Collins (colonist), (1760\u20131819) English naval officer and early settler in Tasmania, Australia", "**William Collins (painter) (1788\u20131847), English landscape artist", "**William Collins (publisher) (1789\u20131853), Scottish publisher; founder of Collins publishing house", "**William Collins (Lord Provost) (1817\u20131895), Scottish temperance movement activist", "**William Collins (New York politician) (1818\u20131878), U.S. congressman from New York", "**William Collins (cricketer, born 1837) (1837\u20131876), Australian cricketer", "**William Collins (sportsman, born 1853) (1853\u20131934), played rugby for England and cricket in New Zealand", "**William Collins (surgeon) (1859\u20131946), British surgeon and Liberal Party politician", "**William Collins (bishop) (1867\u20131911), Bishop of Gibraltar in the Church of England", "**William Collins (cricketer, born 1868) (1868\u20131942), English cricketer", "**William Collins (canoeist) (1932\u20131993), Canadian canoeist who competed in the 1956 Summer Olympics", "*Mr William Collins, character in the Jane Austen novel Pride and Prejudice", "*William Collins, Sons, Scottish printing company", "*William Collins (imprint), a non-fiction publishing brand launched by HarperCollins in 2014"]}, {"page": "1788 in art", "response": ["* September 8 \u2013 William Collins, English landscape and genre painter (died 1847)"]}, {"page": "St George's Cathedral, London", "response": ["On the recommendation of the painter William Collins R.A, a copy of Raphael's Transfiguration by Thomas Brigstocke was purchased as an altarpiece.
