He resigned as registrar in April 1853, before the Oxford University Act 1854 was implemented, with a pension of \u00a3200. He was also Keeper of the Archives from 1826 (\"a post in which his penchant for accumulation seems to have impeded administrative efficiency\", says one writer) and principal of St Mary Hall from 1848 until his death in the principal's lodgings on 18 November 1857. After his death, his correspondence was purchased by the British Museum, and his books were sold for a total of \u00a35,672 14s (about \u00a3 in modern money); the Bodleian acquired 745 of his books.  According to one writer, his \"prominence and diligence in university business and his polished manners made him the embodiment of the traditions of ancien r\u00e9gime Oxford\".   One historian of the University of Oxford, Charles Mallet, wrote that Bliss had \"mourned over the old traditions which were perishing.
