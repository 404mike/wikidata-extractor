He brought to the club Peter Beagrie signed from Sheffield United for \u00a3215,000 and midfielder Chris Kamara from Swindon Town as well as veteran John Gidman. Stoke started the 1988\u201389 season with a 1\u20131 draw at home to Ipswich Town and it took until their seventh match against Walsall to  claim their first victory of the season. By this time two defenders Mark Higgins and John Butler had been added to the ranks and with Stoke's back line more secure results started to improve and after a 4\u20130 win against Hull City in mid-November Stoke lay in 7th position."]}]}}
