Whereas Hooker, eight years Field's senior, had written his Lawes of Ecclesiastical Polity to defend conformity against non-conformity, Field's major work, Of the Church (1606/10), was a defence of the Protestant Church of England under its Elizabethan settlement against the charge of Romanist opponents that it was no church at all.\nField maintained that Anglican piety and polity continued the pre-Tridentine Catholic conciliar tradition. He argued that all the essential doctrinal points of Protestantism had been averred and defended constantly by certain theologians of the Roman Church throughout the preceding centuries, but that this fact had been increasingly overshadowed by the influence of the prevailing papist faction. Thus in essence, when viewed according to its roots in the apostolic gospel as defended by the decreasing minority of faithful spokesmen, the Church of Rome had always been a Protestant church \u2013 but that this had been overwhelmed by the ever-worsening papist/Romanist (Field used both terms) errors.\nAlthough in his personality he was known as having an amiable and peaceable disposition, his writings against the papists, particularly Robert Bellarmine and Stapleton, rose to heights of implacable polemicism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 15", "response": ["*1561 \u2013 Richard Field, English cathedral dean (d. 1616)"]}, {"page": "1561", "response": ["* October 15 \u2013 Richard Field, English cathedral dean (d. 1616)"]}, {"page": "Hemel Hempstead", "response": ["* Richard Field (1561\u20131616) a theologian associated with the founding of the Anglican Church, was born in Hemel Hempstead."]}, {"page": "Berkhamsted School", "response": ["*Richard Field (1561\u20131616), clergyman and theologian"]}, {"page": "Richard Field", "response": ["Richard Field may refer to:", "*Richard Field (Jesuit) (1554?\u20131606), Anglo-Irish Jesuit", "*Richard Field (printer) (1561\u20131624), English printer and publisher, best known for his close association with the poems of William Shakespeare", "*Richard Field (theologian) (1561\u20131616), English ecclesiological theologian associated with the work of Richard Hooker", "*Richard Field (politician) (1866\u20131961), member of the Tasmanian Parliament", "*Richard Field (judge) (born 1947), judge of the High Court of England and Wales", "*Richard Field (footballer) (1891\u20131965), British footballer", "*Richard Fields (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Richard Field (printer)", "response": ["Richard Field (or Feild) (1561\u20131624) was a printer and publisher in Elizabethan London, best known for his close association with the poems of William Shakespeare, with whom he grew up in Stratford-upon-Avon.Kirwood, A.

In 1592 his brother, Jasper Field, joined Richard's business as an apprentice.", "There is no direct evidence for a connection between Shakespeare and Field after 1601, but an indirect connection exists in a reference in Shakespeare's Cymbeline, believed to have been written around 1610. In IV, ii, 377 of that play, Imogen gives the decapitated corpse of Cloten the name \"Richard du Champ,\" French for Richard Field. (When printing Spanish texts, Field called himself \"Ricardo del Campo.\")Shapiro, James. A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare: 1599. New York, HarperCollins, 2005; p. 133. Shakespeare's reason for giving his friend and colleague's name to the headless corpse of a villain is a matter of speculation. However, at this point in the play Imogen believes the body to be that of her husband Posthumus. When discovered (dressed as a young man) embracing the corpse, she dissembles by inventing the imaginary \"du Champ\", referring to him as \"a very valiant Briton and a good\", calling herself his devoted servant. For this reason the name is typically interpreted as an affectionate compliment to Field.Ros King, Cymbeline: constructions of Britain, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, p.89.; Laurie E.
