The genus was later briefly characterized by Frederick William Hope in 1840, under the new name \"Corynodes\". In 1865, Thomas Ansell Marshall published a monograph on Corynodes, dividing it into seven subgenera: Platycorynus, Corynodes, Theumorus, Eurycorynus, Omodon, Erigenes, and Bathycolpus. The latter five were originally intended to be new genera. In the same year, Hamlet Clark created a new genus, Corynoeides, for one of the species placed in Corynodes. However, Joseph Sugar Baly did not accept Clark's genus nor Marshall's subdivisions. In 1956, Monr\u00f3s & Bechyn\u00e9 pointed out that Platycorynus Chevrolat in Dejean, 1836 was available and had priority over Corynodes Hope, 1840, and that therefore the former should be used as the valid name for the genus."]}, {"page": "Megalopus elongatus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sugar Baly"]}, {"page": "Promechus whitei", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sugar Baly"]}, {"page": "Aulacophora albofasciata", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sugar Baly"]}, {"page": "Aulacophora antennata", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sugar Baly"]}, {"page": "Aulacophora apicicornis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sugar Baly"]}, {"page": "Aulacophora approximata", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sugar Baly"]}, {"page": "Colasposoma abdominale", "response": ["Colasposoma abdominale is a species of leaf beetle of Botswana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
