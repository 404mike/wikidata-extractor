He also played for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1909), the Gentlemen of England (1910) and H.D.G. Leveson-Gower's XI (1911).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["From 1883 to 1959 inclusive, Yorkshire always had an amateur club captain. The extent of leadership given by these gentlemen has long been a subject of discussion. Hawke and Sellers are generally held to have been autocratic and decisive, but in fact both relied heavily on sound professional advice. At the other extreme, Wilfred Rhodes is supposed to have been the de facto captain from 1920 to 1930, but it was Major Arthur Lupton who restored discipline to the side when a row erupted between Yorkshire and Middlesex in 1924.", "Lord Hawke famously said at the Yorkshire Annual General Meeting in 1925: \"Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England. I love and admire them all, but we have always had an amateur skipper and when the day comes when we shall have no more amateurs captaining England it will be a thousand pities.\" In view of this, it is perhaps surprising that, when Arthur Lupton retired at the end of the 1927 season, Hawke was one of the sponsors of the suggestion that Herbert Sutcliffe should become Yorkshire captain. In the event, there was sufficient opposition to the idea amongst the Yorkshire committee and players (some of the latter felt that Wilfred Rhodes, as senior professional, had a prior claim), that the proposal was dropped."]}, {"page": "Wilfred Rhodes", "response": ["In each of the four seasons from 1922 to 1925, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs each year, averaging over 30 except in 1924; in 1925 his average was 40.91, only the second time it exceeded 40 in an English cricket season. Rhodes, by now part of a very powerful county bowling attack, was usually the fourth or fifth bowler used.Thomson, p. 155\u20136. Although he imparted less spin to the ball than in his younger days, he continually bowled a good length and placed fielders in positions which very effectively blocked the scoring opportunities of the batsmen.Hodgson, p. 113. He took over 100 wickets in 1922, 1923 and 1924, but took only 57 in 1925, a very good year for batting.Thomson, p. 160 As Yorkshire's senior professional Rhodes was very influential in this period. He cultivated a hostile attitude among the bowlers, directed the team tactically and raised its standard of fielding.Rogerson, p. 139. Alan Hill wrote that Yorkshire captains (who were usually poor cricketers) generally deferred to Rhodes as senior professional; for example, Arthur Lupton, captain from 1925 to 1927, \"very wisely left the cricket affairs to the joint supervision of Rhodes and Emmott Robinson.\"Hill, p. 107. Stories emerged that he was an \"overmighty subject\", arranging the positions of fielders and changing the bowler without reference to his nominal captain.Rogerson, pp. 22\u20133. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional touched his arm and said, \"It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has declared [the innings over].\"Ryder, p. 181.Hill, pp. 107\u20138. However, all the captains to whom biographer Sidney Rogerson spoke mentioned their good relations with Rhodes, although they agreed that he could be difficult.Rogerson, p. 23.  Beverley Lyon, who captained Gloucestershire between 1929 and 1934, criticised Rhodes for insisting young professionals take the game seriously, thus promoting a no-risk attitude.Rogerson, pp. 17\u20138."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe", "response": ["In the autumn of 1927, the Yorkshire committee decided to appoint Sutcliffe as team captain in succession to Arthur Lupton, who had retired. He would thus have become the first professional to captain the side since 1882 but, as Wisden records, \"objection was taken to this action by two different parties\". There were those who supported the view that no professional should be captain; and significant opposition also came from a large number of members who argued that, if a professional were to be appointed, it should be Wilfred Rhodes rather than Sutcliffe.  Sutcliffe himself was en route to South Africa while most of the furore developed and had to rely on telegrams for his news. When first advised of the appointment, he sent a reply that spoke of the great honour and his desire to serve Yorkshire and England. But he was better apprised of the controversy when he arrived in Cape Town and finally sent a message that he was declining the offer but willing to serve under any other captain.Arlott, On Cricket, p.270."]}, {"page": "Emmott Robinson", "response": ["One oft-quoted anecdote, first recorded by Cardus, concerned Yorkshire's 1926 captain, Arthur Lupton, who started padding up after a wicket fell.  Robinson reportedly said to him: \"Tha's no need to pad up, Major.  Wilfred's declaring at t'end o' t'over\"."]}, {"page": "William Worsley", "response": ["Worsley followed Major Arthur Lupton as captain, but only accepted the position after the Yorkshire committee had initially offered Herbert Sutcliffe the captaincy. Sutcliffe refused the offer after controversy broke out over the decision. The county lost only twice whilst Worsley was captain. He was awarded his county cap in 1928."]}, {"page": "Lupton", "response": ["* Arthur Lupton (1879\u20131944), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927", "response": ["The Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927 arose from a disagreement among members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club over the selection of a new captain to succeed the retired Major Arthur Lupton. The main issue was whether a professional cricketer should be appointed to the post. It was a tradition throughout English county cricket that captains should always be amateurs. At Yorkshire, a succession of amateur captains held office in the 1920s, on the grounds of their supposed leadership qualities, although they were not worth their place in the team as cricketers. None lasted long; after Lupton's departure some members felt it was time to appoint a more accomplished cricketer on a long-term basis.", "Yorkshire appointed Major Arthur Lupton as captain, hoping that his experience in the army would allow him to exercise greater control than his predecessors had managed. Aged 46, he was old for a cricketer. He had played once for Yorkshire in 1908, but was no longer an effective batsman. He was very popular with the players, and managed to improve discipline but had little influence on team tactics.Woodhouse, p. 333. He left such matters to Rhodes and Robinson, to the point where several apocryphal stories emerged about his lack of control. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional touched his arm and said, \"It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has declared [the innings over].\"Ryder, p. 181.Hill, pp. 107\u20138. After three years in charge, Lupton resigned the captaincy at the end of 1927. In their search for a successor, Yorkshire hoped to appoint a player with a better cricketing reputation who would serve for a longer term."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1919\u20131927)", "response": ["Following the retirement of Geoffrey Wilson after the 1924 season, Yorkshire appointed yet another amateur as captain, this time Major Arthur Lupton who held the post from 1925 through 1927.  Otherwise the team was unchanged apart from representative calls and Yorkshire generally sent out Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Kilner, Rhodes, Robinson, Lupton, Macaulay, Dolphin and Waddington in 1925.  Arthur Mitchell was still a reserve and Cyril Turner made his first-class debut.", "In the autumn of 1927, the Yorkshire committee decided to appoint Sutcliffe as team captain in succession to Arthur Lupton, who had retired.
