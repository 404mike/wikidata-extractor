Joshua Cristall produced a similar pencil sketch in 1803. Henry Gastineau drew the bridge in about 1819. Due to a printing error that confused his drawing of the bridge with one of the tower at Raglan Castle on the opposite page of the printed collection, Gastineau's image often appears with the title Gate and Bridge, Ragland. The artist of the American West Thomas Moran produced an undated pencil drawing of the bridge which is printed in his Field Sketches. A depiction of the bridge in stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe can be seen in the Memorial of the Boer War window in St Mary's Priory Church in Monmouth."]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Joshua Cristall (1767\u20131847) \u2013 Cornish watercolour painter"]}, {"page": "Wychwood", "response": ["*Barking Timber in Wychwood Forest, Oxfordshire by Joshua Cristall (1768-1847)"]}, {"page": "Mary Cowden Clarke", "response": ["Mary Victoria Novello was born at 240 Oxford Street, London, 22 June 1809.

During her early years she made at her father's house the acquaintance of many men distinguished in art and letters. John Varley, Copley Fielding, Havell, and Joshua Cristall among artists, and Charles and Mary Lamb, Leigh Hunt, and John Keats among writers, were included in the circle of her father's most intimate friends, and she acquired much of her taste for literature from Mary Lamb, who gave her lessons in Latin and poetical reading.

He went on to paint with greater brilliancy of colour, producing works that included angular block forms. Clifford praised Thirtle's ability to organise his subjects harmoniously in an unforced and unselfconscious way, but noted how he was less able than Crome to \"give the impression of an unaffected, unselected chunk of nature\". Hemingway, who describes Thirtle as \"an outstanding if variable\" watercolour artist to be ranked alongside De Wint and Joshua Cristall, describes Thirtle's ability to create the feeling of space as \"exceptional\".
