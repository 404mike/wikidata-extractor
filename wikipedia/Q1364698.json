The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born William Dyce (1806\u20131864). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to Ruskin.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , p. 348. His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his The Man of Sorrows and David in the Wilderness (both 1860), which contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 100. Joseph Noel Paton (1821\u20131901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of Millais and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as The Bludie Tryst (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , p. 213. Also influenced by Millais was James Archer (1823\u20131904), whose work includes Summertime, Gloucestershire (1860) and who from 1861 began a series of Arthurian-based paintings including La Morte d'Arthur and Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere.R. Barber, The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief (Harvard University Press, 2004), , p. 275.", "* Joseph Noel Paton (painter)", "Many members of the \u2018inner\u2019 Pre-Raphaelite circle (Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones) and \u2018outer\u2019 circle (Frederick Sandys, Arthur Hughes, Simeon Solomon, Henry Hugh Armstead, Joseph Noel Paton, Frederic Shields, Matthew James Lawless) were working concurrently in painting, illustration, and sometimes poetry. Victorian morality judged literature as superior to painting, because of its \u201cnoble grounds for noble emotion.\u201d Robert Buchanan (a writer and opponent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) felt so strongly about this artistic hierarchy that he wrote: \u201cThe truth is that literature, and more particularly poetry, is in a very bad way when one art gets hold of another, and imposes upon it its conditions and limitations.\" as cited in Welland, D.S.R. The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art. London, UK: George G. Harrap & Co. Ltd., 14. This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize subject painting, which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the Sister Arts), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan."]}, {"page": "Dean Cemetery", "response": ["* Joseph Noel Paton (1821\u20131901) artist"]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Sir Joseph Noel Paton (1821\u20131901)"]}, {"page": "John Boyd Orr", "response": ["He found the university to be a very stimulating environment.

For example, William Blake painted Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing, depicting a scene from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, around 1785, and Daniel Maclise painted Faun and the Fairies around 1834. Images of fairies dancing in circles became a favourite trope of painters in the Victorian period. On the one hand, artists were genuinely interested in the culture such imagery represented, and on the other, fairies could be depicted as titillating nudes and semi-nudes without offending Victorian mores, which made them a popular subject of art collectors. Examples of Victorian fairy-ring paintings include Come unto these Yellow Sands (1842) by Richard Dadd and Reconciliation of Titania and Oberon (1847) by Joseph Noel Paton."]}, {"page": "St Giles' Cathedral", "response": ["By the 1860s, attitudes to stained glass had liberalised within Scottish Presbyterianism and the insertion of new windows was a key component of William Chambers' plan to restore St Giles'.
