He was educated at Hamilton Academy and embarked for India.\n\nFrom 1871 to 1874 he was Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. During his tenure the Pabna Disturbances occurred. With his proclamation on 4 July 1873 during the Pabna Peasant Uprisings, guaranteeing government support of peasants against excessive zamindar demands he ensured that the prostest remained peaceful, at the same time antagonising the landlords and his namesake George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll at that time Secretary of State for India.\nHe was Member of Parliament (MP) for Kirkcaldy Burghs from 1875 to 1892.\nCampbell married, in 1853, Laetitia Maria Vibart, daughter of John Gowan Vibart, of the Bengal civil service, and left several children.\nLady Campbell died in London 21 October 1901, aged 68. Their eldest son, Major George Campbell (ca. 1861\u20131902), died while serving with the 8th King's Regiment in the Second Boer War in South Africa.He is respected by the Assamese people for his respect for distinct identity of Assamese language", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Khatri", "response": ["Gijsbert Oonk has referred to George Campbell's Ethnology of India, \"I do not know the exact limits of Khatri occupation to the West, but certainly in all Eastern Afghanistan they seem to be just as much part of the community as they are in the Punjab. They find their way into Central Asia.\"", "McLane also describes Punjabi Khatris as a \"mercantile caste who claimed to be Kshatriyas\" and says that they had migrated to several parts of India, possibly long before the 18th century, and to Bengal even before the arrival of the Mughals. In the 19th-century, British administrators failed to agree whether the Khatri claim of Kshatriya status should be accepted. John Nesfield and George Campbell were leaning towards accepting this claim but Herbert Hope Risley and Denzil Ibbetson cast doubts on this claim. John McLane opines that the dilemma was because most of the Khatris pursued Vaishya (mercantile) occupation and not Kshatriya (military) ones. However, he adds that this Vaishya occupation fact was balanced by their origin myths, the \"possible\" derivation of the word Khatri from Kshatriya, their large physical stature, the superior status accorded to them by other Punjabis as well as the willingness of the Saraswat Brahmins, their chaplains, to accept cooked food from them."]}, {"page": "George Campbell (1824-1892)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Campbell (civil servant)"]}, {"page": "Sir George Campbell (governor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Campbell (civil servant)"]}, {"page": "George Campbell (1824-92)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Campbell (civil servant)"]}, {"page": "George Campbell (1824\u201392)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Campbell (civil servant)"]}, {"page": "George Campbell (1824\u20131892)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Campbell (civil servant)"]}]}}
