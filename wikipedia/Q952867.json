The game was based on the  Player Manager game developed by Dino Dini for the Amiga and Atari ST, but was not endorsed by the original creator.

Britsoft: An Oral History was designed as a companion to the 2014 film From Bedrooms to Billions, which covers the \"Britsoft\" era of British game development from the late '70s bedroom developer cottage industry to the present-day billion-pound industry. The book uses developer interviews to tell the era's story so as to supplement rather than reproduce the film's narrative. Interviewed developers include coders and designers David Braben, Geoff Crammond, Mel Croucher, Dino Dini, Jon Hare, Archer MacLean, Jeff Minter, Peter Molyneux and David Perry, businessman David Darling, and writers Chris Anderson, Gary Penn, and Julian Rignall. The book's editor and former Edge editor, Alex Wiltshire, divides the title into eight sections: the developers' initial exposure to video games, the first wave as it attempts to sell its software in the early 1980s, the industry that begins to form, the wealth that comes to the industry, the relationship between these developers and a burgeoning games journalism, the transition from home computers to 16-bit hardware, the coalescing of industry and closure of small businesses, and the late 1990s dispersion as these developers left the industry or moved to less prominent roles in the United States. The book is designed to be read linearly and out of order, based on its presentation as anecdotal snippets rather than long text blocks. It also features linked page numbering such that readers can skip directly to the developer's next page. Reviewers described the 422-page volume by its heft, comprehensiveness, and academicism. Eurogamer and The Verge recommended the book for readers interested in the era as well as readers interested in artistic production. Nintendo Life described the book as lavish, lush, and pleasurable. Reviewers lightly criticised the book's lack of signposted introductions to the many characters, and complained of needing to flip to the appendix for explanatory footnotes and captions for the book's personalities and illustrations. Eurogamer considered the book to come as close to a definitive history of British gaming as is feasible, and praised the book's intimate and fun tone on otherwise dry subject matter."]}, {"page": "Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year", "response": ["| Dino Dini", "| Dino Dini"]}]}}
