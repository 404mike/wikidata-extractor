Peter Berresford Ellis cites the years 1550\u20131650 as a century of immense damage for the language, and its decline can be traced to this period. In 1680, William Scawen wrote an essay describing 16 reasons for the decline of Cornish, among them the lack of a distinctive Cornish alphabet, the loss of contact between Cornwall and Brittany, the cessation of the miracle plays, loss of records in the Civil War, lack of a Cornish Bible, and immigration to Cornwall. Mark Stoyle, however, has argued that the \"glotticide\" of the Cornish language was mainly a result of the Cornish gentry adopting English to disassociate themselves from the reputation for disloyalty and rebellion associated with the Cornish language since the 1497 uprising."]}, {"page": "March 10", "response": ["*1943 \u2013 Peter Berresford Ellis, English historian and author"]}, {"page": "Sinn F\u00e9in", "response": ["*Eyewitness to Irish History, Peter Berresford Ellis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc, Canada 2004, "]}, {"page": "Ambisagrus", "response": ["* Peter Berresford Ellis, Dictionary of Celtic Mythology(Oxford Paperback Reference), Oxford University Press, (1994): "]}, {"page": "Carman", "response": ["Four of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, Crichinbel, Lug, B\u00e9 Chuille and Aoi, challenged Carman and her sons.

Plutarch writes that the Romans were not outnumbered and had 40,000 men but that most were untrained and unaccustomed to weapons.

Diodorus Siculus writes that the Romans had 24,000 men. Livy gives no figures. The modern historians Cary and Scullard estimate that the Romans had 15,000 men and the Gauls 30,000 to 70,000. Peter Berresford Ellis gives an estimate of a minimum of 24,000 based on the assumption that \"the Romans had... four legions \u2013 for each consul had two legions under his command \u2013 and given that each legion had 6,000 men\".

Mundy later expressed disdain for the novel, with his biographer Peter Berresford Ellis describing it as \"the worst book that Talbot ever wrote\". For Ince, Mundy also produced a novelisation of a Western film, When Trails Were New, which dealt with the interactions between Native Americans and European settlers in the Wisconsin woodlands of 1832. He later criticised the novel, with Taves describing it as \"unquestionably one of Mundy's worst stories\". Mundy continued to write his own stories; in December 1922, Adventure published Mundy's Benefit of Doubt, which was followed by a sequel, Treason, in January 1923. These stories involved the character of Athelstan King, and were set in the context of the Malabar rebellion which had taken place in Malabar in 1921.
