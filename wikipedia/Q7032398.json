In I Write What I Like, Biko continues Fanon's project of thinking through alternative conceptions of humanity and offers his theory of Black Consciousness.  Black consciousness applies to anyone who is involved in anti-racist struggle and is marked as the enemy of an anti-black, racist state.  Thus for Biko, all people of color\u2014indigenous Africans, Asians, mixed peoples, and whites who are \"blackened\" by their allegiance to anti-racism\u2014are black.  Biko presents here a political view of identity that resists a prior essence of black identity.  One becomes black, reminiscent of Simone de Beauvoir's observation that one becomes a woman.  South African philosophers influenced by Biko's existentialism include No\u00ebl Chabani Manganyi.
