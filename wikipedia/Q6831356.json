He held the Berry Chair of English Literature at the University of St Andrews until his retirement in 2003. He is best known for his translations of Beowulf and other Anglo-Saxon poems into modern English verse.He was educated at Downside School, read English at Oxford University, then spent a year in France and in Italy, attending the  University of Perugia.  He then spent some years working in the publishing industry in London, interrupted by attending Princeton University. Before taking up his post at St. Andrews he was a lecturer at the University of Stirling.For many years he was a member of the Scottish team in Radio 4's Round Britain quiz show.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Beowulf", "response": ["After 1900, hundreds of translations, whether into prose, rhyming verse, or alliterative verse were made, some relatively faithful, some archaising, some attempting to domesticate the work. Among the best-known modern translations are those of Edwin Morgan, Burton Raffel, Michael J. Alexander, Roy Liuzza, and Seamus Heaney. The difficulty of translating Beowulf has been explored by scholars including J. R. R. Tolkien (in his essay \"On Translating Beowulf\"), who worked on a verse and a prose translation of his own.", "In 2000 (2nd edition 2013), Liuzza published his own version of Beowulf in a parallel text with the Old English, with his analysis of the poem's historical, oral, religious and linguistic contexts. R. D. Fulk, of Indiana University, published a facing-page edition and translation of the entire Nowell Codex manuscript in 2010. Hugh Magennis's 2011 Translating Beowulf: Modern Versions in English Verse discusses the challenges and history of translating the poem, as well as the question of how to approach its poetry, and discusses several post-1950 verse translations, paying special attention to those of Edwin Morgan, Burton Raffel, Michael J. Alexander, and Seamus Heaney. Translating Beowulf is one of the subjects of the 2012 publication Beowulf at Kalamazoo, containing a section with 10 essays on translation, and a section with 22 reviews of Heaney's translation,some of which compare Heaney's work with Liuzza's. Tolkien's long-awaited translation (edited by his son Christopher) was published in 2014 as Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary. The book includes Tolkien's own retelling of the story of Beowulf in his tale Sellic Spell, but not his incomplete and unpublished verse translation. The Mere Wife, by Maria Dahvana Headley, was published in 2018. It relocates the action to a wealthy community in 20th century America and is told primarily from the point of view of Grendel's mother. In 2020, Headley published a translation in which the opening \"Hw\u00e6t!\" is rendered \"Bro!\"."]}, {"page": "University of St Andrews", "response": ["*Michael J.

After Beowulf kills him, Grendel's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland in Sweden and later becomes king of the Geats. After fifty years have passed, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is fatally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants bury him in a tumulus, a burial mound, in Geatland. The translation is followed by a commentary on the poem that became the base for Tolkien's acclaimed 1936 lecture \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\". Furthermore, the book includes Tolkien's previously unpublished \"Sellic Spell\" and two versions of \"The Lay of Beowulf\". The translation was welcomed by scholars and critics, who however doubted that it would find much favour with the public or fans of Tolkien's fiction. Michael J. Alexander described it as close to the original in both meaning and clause-ordering, and like the original was intentionally archaic. Michael Drout, who had begun the task of editing Tolkien's Beowulf, was disappointed by the absence of Tolkien's alliterative verse translation of part of the poem. Others noted that the translation makes clear the indebtedness of The Lord of the Rings to Beowulf.", "Michael J. Alexander, author of a verse translation of Beowulf, reviewed Tolkien's version for The Guardian. He notes that The Lord of the Rings derives its orcs and its Riders of Rohan \"directly from the poem\", though the One Ring has a different source. He writes that he does not know what Tolkien's \"fiction fans\" will make of the book, as \"some [parts of it] are drier than others\". Since Alexander had, many years earlier, been shown a part of Tolkien's verse translation of about one fifth of Beowulf by Christopher Tolkien, he had expected the rendering to be in verse; he notes that both the Tolkien verse fragment, and Alexander's own version, imitated the form of the original, \"stimulated by the example of Ezra Pound's version of [the Old English poem] 'The Seafarer'\". In contrast, Tolkien's prose version \"sticks as closely as possible to the meaning and clause-order of the original\". In Alexander's view, it \"has great accuracy and a sense of rhythm\", casting its own spell despite its archaism and \"striking inversions of word-order\"; he notes that the original, too, was intentionally archaic. Alexander writes that only readers familiar with the original will see the \"felicities\" of Tolkien's rendering, and the commentary, too, may work best on knowledgeable readers."]}, {"page": "Translating Beowulf", "response": ["The task of the poet-translator in particular, like that of the Anglo-Saxon poet, is then to assemble multiple techniques to give the desired effects. Scholars and translators such as Michael J. Alexander have noted that it is impossible to use all the same effects in the same places as the Beowulf poet did, but it is feasible, though difficult, to give something of the feeling of the original, and for the translation to work as poetry.", "Among the challenges noted by the translator Michael J. Alexander are whether to attempt a verse or prose rendering; how closely to stick to the original; and whether to make the language archaic, as indeed the original was, or to use distinctly modern phraseology. In addition, the original is both laconic and full of understatement. He wrote that \"the blend of metre, syntax, diction and idiom in the artistic economy of the original can only be [achieved] by redistributing the rarer effects. Each line and sentence necessarily sacrifices some quality in the original. What you lose here, you hope to restore there.\"", "The author of a popular and widely-used 1973 translation, Michael J. Alexander, writes that since the story was familiar to its Anglo-Saxon audience, the telling was all-important. The audience liked \"the elaborate unstraightforwardness with which the expected is disguised\", accompanied by \"laconic understatement\" and negative constructions. Thus, after Wiglaf has had to kill the dragon to enter its mound, he narrates that his reptilian host showed him \"little courtesy\" for his visit. ", "! Beowulf 3087\u20133090 !! Michael J.
