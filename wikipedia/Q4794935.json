Additionally, the managing director of Hawker Siddeley, Sir Arnold Alexander Hall, decided that his company would remain in the project as a favoured sub-contractor, developing and manufacturing the wings for the A300, which would later become pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights.

As an experienced aviator, Cunningham was invited to attend. Henry Tizard invited Cunningham to air his views at the meeting. Tizard referred him to the Royal Aircraft Establishment to meet Arnold Alexander Hall, a gun sight expert. With his engineering expertise and Cunningham's assessment of the issue, Hall ironed out the inadequacies in the design. Hall later became Cunningham's managing director at Hawker Siddeley twenty years later. Cunningham also worked with ground control of interception (GCI) carrying out various exercises. He made the acquaintance of Philip Joubert de la Fert\u00e9, (Chief of the Air Staff), who dropped in on 604 as well as Douglas\u2014the two men were always keen to hear the experiences of the crew.", "On 1 December 1958 he was appointed a member of the de Havilland board, but the company was sold and merged into Hawker Siddeley in 1960. With the Siddeley company, he was instrumental in the development in the Hawker Siddeley Trident in 1962. Cunningham worked under the managing director Arnold Alexander Hall, whom he had first met in 1940 to iron out the malfunctions in the Beaufighter gun sight. Later Cunningham acted as a consultant and advisor to the Chinese Government from 1972 to 1979 as the company sought to increase its revenue by selling aircraft to China. At their insistence, he postponed his retirement for three years to complete a series of aircraft sales. On 1 May 1975 the British Government announced the nationalisation of the industry and British Aerospace consumed all the nation's manufacturers."]}, {"page": "Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)", "response": ["* 1983: Sir Arnold Alexander Hall 'for his outstanding contributions to the aeronautical industry, and in particular to aeronautical engineering'"]}, {"page": "Arnold Hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arnold Alexander Hall"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| |Arnold Alexander Hall||19/03/1953||23 April 1915 \u2013 9 January 2000"]}, {"page": "1954 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Arnold Alexander Hall, Director, Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1953", "response": ["# Sir Arnold Alexander Hall"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2000", "response": ["*Arnold Alexander Hall, 84, British aeronautical engineer, scientist and industrialist."]}]}}
