He created and systematically developed liquid crystal materials science, and established a method of practical molecular design. Gray was recipient of the 1995 Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liquid crystal", "response": ["After World War II, work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials."]}, {"page": "September 4", "response": ["*1926 \u2013 George William Gray, British chemist who developed liquid crystals that made displays possible (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "1926 in science", "response": ["* September 4 \u2013 George William Gray (died 2013), Scottish chemist, discoverer of stable liquid crystal materials leading to the development of liquid-crystal displays."]}, {"page": "George Gray", "response": ["* George William Gray (1926\u20132013), scientist, developer of cyano-biphenyl liquid crystals used in liquid crystal displays"]}, {"page": "Denny, Falkirk", "response": ["* George William Gray, chemist"]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["* George William Gray, chemist, pioneer of stable liquid crystals, awarded Kyoto Prize and Leverhulme Medal"]}, {"page": "William Gray", "response": ["*George William Gray (1926\u20132013), Scottish organic chemist"]}, {"page": "List of Kyoto Prize winners", "response": ["|George William Gray"]}, {"page": "Roy Sambles", "response": ["* 1998 - the George William Gray medal of the British Liquid Crystal Society."]}, {"page": "George W.
