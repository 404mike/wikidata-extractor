Slade clearly enjoys his job and is very dedicated to it even though his attitude sometimes suggests otherwise. He was inspired to join the police because of his father Jack who was a highly respected detective himself until his false arrest and imprisonment for theft in 1992. Jeff took this very hard as he had always admired his father and refused to believe he was capable of such a thing following such a distinguished 30-year career. Slade was once married but very little is known about how long he was married and indeed how the marriage ended but it is thought that his wife died as he keeps a picture in his flat of a girl he tells Holly is now dead. Outside work Slade tends to keep himself to himself and rarely if ever socialises with colleagues such as Morris and Nicky. His only real friend at work is science officer Holly Turner.

Michael French, cast as Nick Jordan, was already well known for his role as David Wicks in EastEnders. French's cast-mates included George Irving, Angela Griffin, Lisa Faulkner and Nicola Stephenson. This propensity towards famous names was explained by Young, who commented: \"Soap actors are the best actors. There\u2019s been so much snobbery before.

Following Nick's 2006 departure from Holby City, the series' official website described him as: \"decisive, confident, charismatic and passionate. He was constantly striving for the top and wanted to emulate Meyer. Six years after resigning, he returned with more arrogance and ruthlessness.\" Announcing the character's transfer to sister show Casualty, the BBC revealed that upon returning, Nick would have undergone another change of character, stating: \"[Nick] created waves when he worked at Holby before. [But] the emergency department [will] be in for a shock when they discover he's not quite as hard-hearted and ruthless as they expected. But what, or who, could have caused this and how long will it last?\" French says of Nick on returning to Holby; \"He's still arrogant. [...] He gets a kick out of running the department. He's learnt from his past mistakes and is keen to start afresh. [...] He demands respect, but not everyone likes his manner.

The series homepage assesses that: \"He had tremendous pulling power with women, but commitment was not his strong point.\" Michael French, discussing his character shortly after the show's 1999 conception, asserted that: \"Like most blokes, he sometimes treats women as playthings \u2013 if they\u2019re willing. A little bit of hanky panky is part of the human condition, after all!\" Sarah Preston, who played Nick's ex-wife Karen in the first two series of the show, stated of her most memorable moments filming: \"I loved my scenes with Michael, he was great to work with. Confrontation scenes give you something to get your teeth into and we had plenty of those!\" Similarly, Rosie Marcel who plays Jac commented that her character and Nick \"have some really bad history between them. [...] They've worked together before and Jac knows Nick will tread on anyone's toes to get to the top. It makes for some great fight scenes.\" Nick's series eight relationship with Diane ended, again acrimoniously, when she was blamed for a mistake he had made in theatre and refused to own up.

He's a fantastic actor and Nick Jordan is an iconic character. Nick Jordan will put a few noses out of joint, most notably Adam's. Adam knows Nick Jordan's reputation of old, and finds it hard to believe that Nick is a good guy. Nick Jordan causes ripples wherever he goes, and it's great that he'll be causing ripples in Holby City's Emergency Department. The ED gang are astonished he is joining them, they certainly didn't see it coming. Some of them know him of old, whereas some of the others have just heard of his reputation - either way, his arrival certainly puts the cat among the pigeons.\" Michael French has stated of the transfer: \"The BBC came up with the idea of Nick Jordan coming back to head up Casualty.

On-screen Natalie and Ricky found themselves sidelined and bullied by Bianca, forcing them together and leading to their eventual affair, which continued for several weeks on-screen, with Ricky seeing both Natalie and Bianca. The storyline reached its climax on 21 February 1995; 17.0\u00a0million viewers tuned in to witness Bianca discovering that her boyfriend was sleeping with her best friend.
