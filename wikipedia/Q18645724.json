His son John had a brief spell of League football with the club in the 1950s. In 2001, John Edgar told the Northern Echo that as a young man he had had the opportunity to sign for Sunderland, but his father strongly advised him to continue his education rather than taking the risk of a career in professional football. \"In those days you did as your father told you\", so he trained as a schoolteacher and played mainly non-league football. Dave Edgar died in Darlington in 1976 at the age of 74."]}]}}
