The London Evening Standard reported that the fee was \u00a31.2\u00a0million, of which \u00a3200,000 would go to Watford as part of a sell-on clause. Manager Owen Coyle said: \"He can play as a striker, or behind the striker or wide or as a central midfielder. He gives you a host of variations, but outwith that he's a talented footballer and that's what we want \u2013 young exciting talents to complement the quality we already have.\" Eagles made his league debut for Burnley on 9 August in a 4\u20131 loss to Sheffield Wednesday. On 27 September, he scored his first goal for Burnley in a 3\u20131 victory over rivals Preston North End. He was nominated for the Championship Player of the Month award for November, losing out to Chris Iwelumo. He ended the 2008\u201309 season with eight goals in 57 league and cup appearances, and came on as a 69th-minute substitute for Robbie Blake as Burnley beat Sheffield United 1\u20130 in the Championship play-off Final at Wembley Stadium."]}, {"page": "Kevin Blackwell", "response": ["In the summer of 2005 Blackwell was given financial backing and bought some high-profile players for the new season. Proven strikers Richard Cresswell, Rob Hulse and Robbie Blake gave Blackwell plenty of firepower up front, while USA winger Eddie Lewis arrived to supply the ammunition. Once again Blackwell had convinced in-demand players to join Leeds. Blackwell's shrewd tactics away from Elland Road and attacking style at home (where 9 out of 10 matches were won) proved very effective and, by the end of February, Blackwell had guided Leeds to 3rd spot and an almost guaranteed play off spot, with automatic promotion remaining a possibility. The Leeds team, however, then produced some distinctly average performances and settled for their play-off place."]}, {"page": "Frank Sinclair", "response": ["In June 2004, Sinclair joined Championship side Burnley on a free transfer, signing a one-year contract. He made his debut for the club on 7 August in the opening match of the 2004\u201305 season against Sheffield United. He struck up an impressive partnership at the centre of the defence with fellow new recruit John McGreal at the start of the season, starting in the majority of games. On 24 December, Sinclair signed a new two-year contract extension until June 2007, with \"Clarets\" manager Steve Cotterill stating that \"he has been an integral part of our defence\". In January 2005, he was appointed as captain following the departure of Robbie Blake to Birmingham City. On 5 February, he was sent off in the local derby defeat to Leeds United after receiving two bookings. His first goal for the club came from a header on 12 March, in a 2\u20131 win over Rotherham United at Turf Moor. Towards the end of the season he received plaudits for his impressive partnership with young loan signing Gary Cahill and made a total of 42 appearances in his first season with the club as the side finished in mid-table."]}, {"page": "Steve Cotterill", "response": ["In the summer of 2004, a decision by Burnley not to renew the contract of their manager, Stan Ternent, led to Cotterill being named as the new manager of the club.

They also reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, beating Premier League side Liverpool 1\u20130 in the third round. After losing striker and captain Robbie Blake and young midfielder Richard Chaplow they finished 13th in the Championship.

Coyle also later signed Marcos Alonso from Real Madrid for an undisclosed fee and also brought Ivan Klasni\u0107 back to the club on a free transfer after spending the previous season on loan at the Reebok. In January 2011, he made two further signings, buying David Wheater from Middlesbrough and signing Daniel Sturridge on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season. In his first full season at the club, Coyle's team finished 14th in the Premier League and reached the semi-final stage of the FA Cup, where they were beaten 5\u20130 by Stoke City."]}, {"page": "Ade Akinbiyi", "response": ["During the rest of the 2006\u201307 season, Akinbiyi was not as successful as during his first spell at Turf Moor, scoring three goals. This was attributed by Steve Cotterill to Akinbiyi having spent too much time in the weights room at Sheffield United and as a result being too bulky. He was given the number nine shirt for the 2007\u201308 season but found himself behind Andy Gray and Robbie Blake as a first choice striker. After going back to Burnley, Akinbiyi lacked consistent form, finding goals harder to come by. His hard work and endeavour made him a firm fans' favourite. During the 2008\u201309 season, his regular position on the bench was taken by youngster Jay Rodriguez, a player who he had been mentoring. However, Akinbiyi regained his place on the bench in the fifth round of the League Cup against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and in the 69th minute he scored to make the game 1\u20131 and take it into extra time. Burnley won 5\u20134 on penalties. While at Burnley, Steve Cotterill, Burnley's then manager, banned him from the gym. \"I wasn't playing at Sheffield so the only thing I was doing was weights. We didn't even have reserve games and it was something to do. I put on a bit too much muscle and I lost about a yard of pace\", he said. \"I try to stay away from the weights room now. I'm sort of addicted.\""]}, {"page": "Ashley Westwood (footballer, born 1976)", "response": ["He played just five Premier League games in 1999\u20132000, though Bradford picked up 13 out of 15 points in those games, a sizeable chunk of their final tally of 36 points. The final of these games was a 3\u20130 win over Wimbledon at Valley Parade on 30 April 2000. This was a vital result because had the \"Dons\" won then they would have survived relegation at Bradford's expense. Westwood replaced Robbie Blake as a 67th minute substitute. He went into Europe in July 2000, making two appearances in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, victories over FK Atlantas and RKC Waalwijk.

He ended the 2007\u201308 season with 24 appearances to his name, but was unable to prevent the \"Royals\" from being relegated. Speaking in September 2008, Coppell bemoaned the fact that Bikey's international commitments had left him only able to train with the club on six days within a three-month period. He scored three goals in 25 Championship games during the 2008\u201309 campaign as Reading qualified for the play-offs. However, he was sent off for stamping on Robbie Blake during the play-off semi-final first leg at Burnley on 9 May, having earlier conceded the winning penalty taken by Graham Alexander. He aggravated the situation by ripping off his shirt and stamping around the pitch, resulting in the extension of his ban to five games and a charge for improper conduct."]}, {"page": "Tr\u00e9sor Kandol", "response": ["After scoring 18 goals from 21 games for Barnet at the start of the 2006\u201307 season, Kandol joined Championship club Leeds United in a two-month loan deal on 23 November 2006.

His full home debut came with a debut goal in front of his new fans against Barnsley. When the January 2007 transfer window opened, his move to Elland Road was made permanent by Dennis Wise for an initial fee of \u00a3320,000. After Leeds were relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history, Kandol scored a last-minute winner against Tranmere Rovers in the opening game of the 2007\u201308 League One season. He formed a successful strike partnership with Jermaine Beckford in the first half of the season, winning him player of the August and September month award but loss of form and the arrival of Dougie Freedman meant Kandol lost his place in the starting eleven despite scoring 15 goals, as Leeds went on to reach the playoffs.
