He made his name in 2004 by scoring a stunning last-minute goal from long range to give Liverpool a 2\u20131 victory over Arsenal at Anfield. Mellor also scored a vital goal and set up another during Liverpool's match with Olympiacos at Anfield during the group stage of the 2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League, which Liverpool went on to win. In December 2011, a knee injury sustained following a tackle by Milton Keynes striker Jabo Ibehre resulted in Mellor being forced into announcing his retirement on 9 May 2012. Since his retirement, Mellor has been doing media work, including match updates for Sky Sports News and work for LFC TV.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Welsh (English footballer)", "response": ["However, three minutes into a match against Preston North End on 10 March 2007, Welsh dived into a tackle with Preston's Neil Mellor, a former Liverpool teammate.

By the second half of the season, he added four more goals, including another brace against Hereford United on 29 January 2011.
