Ritchie received the first VC awarded to naval personnel during the First World War for his actions during a raid on the German colonial harbour of Dar-es-Salaam in November 1914, which left him seriously wounded.Despite the courage of his actions during the raid, Ritchie was not initially recommended for the Victoria Cross. Delayed by discussion at the Admiralty concerning the correct medal to award, it was not until 24 April 1915, nearly six months later, that the medal was presented.  Ritchie never fully recovered from his wounds and was forced into early retirement the following year. Although he lived another 41 years, he never again commanded at sea.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HMS Goliath (1898)", "response": ["In November, Goliath attempted to get close enough to neutralise K\u00f6nigsberg, but the water was too shallow to permit her to get within range of the cruiser. As a result, she left to bombard Dar es Salaam on 28 November and 30 November. In the former attack, Commander Henry Ritchie, Goliaths executive officer, won the Victoria Cross. Goliath and the protected cruiser  destroyed the colonial governor's residence; the second bombardment proved to be less effective. Goliath underwent a refit at Simonstown, South Africa, from December 1914 to February 1915. She then returned to the Rufiji delta on 25 February, as it seemed from German activities that K\u00f6nigsbergs commander intended to break out soon. During this period, Goliath bombarded German positions at Lindi, but she saw no action with K\u00f6nigsberg. On 25 March, Goliath was ordered to move to the Mediterranean to take part in operations off the Dardanelles, her place being taken by the protected cruiser ; the battleship left East African waters a week later on 1 April."]}, {"page": "Ritchie", "response": ["*Henry Ritchie (1876\u20131958), British Navy officer"]}, {"page": "Henry Peel Ritchie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Ritchie"]}, {"page": "Henry Ritchie (disambiguation)", "response": ["Henry Ritchie was a recipient of the Victoria Cross.", "Henry Ritchie may also refer to:"]}]}}
