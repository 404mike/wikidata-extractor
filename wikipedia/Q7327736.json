In May 1911, he joined Clapton Orient, scoring on his debut against Derby County on 2 September.McFadden broke Orient's goalscoring record in his first season with the club, scoring 19 goals, only to break the record again in what was to be his final season, 1914\u20131915, with 21 goals. In the intervening two seasons, he was still Orient's top scorer. He also represented a Southern XI in a match against England in November 1914, scoring the only goal of the game, after which a Daily Express reporter declared that McFadden was the \"outstanding player on the field\".McFadden attracted press attention off the pitch in 1912 when he rescued an 11-year-old boy from the River Lea, for which he received a medal from the Mayor of Hackney. Prior to joining Clapton Orient McFadden had also risked his own life when rescuing a man from a burning building.At the outbreak of World War I professional football was suspended, and McFadden joined the 17th Battalion Middlesex Regiment, the \"Footballers' Battalion\", along with 40 other Orient players and staff. He rose to the rank of Company Sergeant Major. During the Battle of the Somme, he witnessed the death of his childhood friend and Orient teammate William Jonas in July 1916, and was injured himself a few weeks later. On his recovery he returned to the front and earned the Military Medal, but on 22 October 1916, McFadden was fatally wounded by a shell blast whilst leading his men near Serre-l\u00e8s-Puisieux. He died of wounds the next day in a field hospital. His death was acknowledged by other football clubs, including Arsenal in their official programme, and the Manchester Football Chronicle stated, \"In civil life he was a hero, and he proved himself a hero on the battlefield.\" McFadden is buried at Couin British Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 23", "response": ["*1916 \u2013 Richard McFadden, Scottish footballer and soldier (b. 1889)"]}, {"page": "Leyton Orient F.C.", "response": ["During the Battle of the Somme, three players gave their lives for king and country: Richard McFadden, George Scott and William Jonas.

Prior to the First World War, O's striker McFadden had saved the life of a boy who was drowning in the River Lea as well as rescuing a man from a burning building.", "The story of the club's major involvement in the First World War has been told in a 2005 book entitled They Took The Lead, by Stephen Jenkins, deputy chairman of Leyton Orient Supporters' Club. In July 2006 Jenkins, assisted by Les Bailey, took a party of 150 Leyton Orient supporters and members of the Leyton and Manor Park Royal British Legion over to the Somme region of northern France, to visit World War I war graves and to pay their respects at the resting places of Richard McFadden, William Jonas and George Scott. This was the first official visit to the Orient war graves for 90\u00a0years. A second visit to the Somme took place the weekend of 12/13 July 2008, this time 183 O's supporters and members of the RBL made the historic pilgrimage.
