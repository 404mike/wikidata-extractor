Their form was somewhat erratic through the autumn, but they remained in the top half of the table and a run of four wins in six games around Christmas put them into third place. Another run of poor form followed, leaving them outside the play-off zone by mid-February, but with 3 defeats in their final 14 games they were able to secure a sixth place and a play-off berth. After defeating Notts County 5\u20132 on aggregate over two legs, City faced Exeter City in the play-off final at Wembley. Coventry took a 3\u20130 lead with second-half goals from Jordan Willis, Jordan Shipley and Jack Grimmer, eventually winning the game 3\u20131. This resulted in their first promotion for 51 years since being guided into the First Division by Hill in 1967. They had a solid season back in League One for 2018\u201319 finishing in eighth position. A run of five consecutive victories in October saw them briefly in the play-off positions, but this was followed by seven games without a win, five of which were lost, and ultimately they missed the top six by eight points."]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| James Maddison Jordan Willis", "|align=left| Jordan Turnbull Jordan Willis", "|align=left| Jordan Turnbull Jordan Willis"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["*13 \u2013 Jordan Willis is called up to the England Under-18 squad for the first time for the match against Poland Under-19.", "*7 \u2013 Jordan Willis wins first cap for England Under-18 in friendly against Poland Under-19.", "| Jordan Willis", "|Coventry City U18's Player of the Year Award ||  Jordan Willis", "| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jordan Willis"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["| Jordan Willis", "| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jordan Willis", "| Jordan Willis ||  Nuneaton Town || 2 January 2013 || 3 January 2013 \u2013 rejectedhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20894253"]}, {"page": "Joe Henderson (footballer, born 1993)", "response": ["In March 2012, Henderson joined Conference North side Nuneaton Town on a work experience deal until the end of the season.
