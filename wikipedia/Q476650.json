He was in command of the expedition's base at Cape Evans for much of 1912, and led the party which found the tent containing the bodies of Scott, \"Birdie\" Bowers and Edward Wilson. Atkinson was subsequently associated with two controversies: that relating to Scott's orders concerning the use of dogs, and that relating to the possible incidence of scurvy in the polar party. He is commemorated by the Atkinson Cliffs on the northern coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica, at 71\u00b018\u2032S 168\u00b055\u2032E.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Apsley Cherry-Garrard", "response": ["Scott had left orders for dog-driver Meares and surgeon Edward L.

As Cecil Meares was not available for work, Atkinson had to attend to a medical emergency, and George Simpson was busy, the fateful choice fell on Cherry-Garrard. Belatedly, on 26 February 1912, Cherry-Garrard and dog handler Dimitri Gerov set off southwards and soon reached One Ton Depot on 3 March, and deposited additional food."]}, {"page": "Forest School, Walthamstow", "response": ["150px|thumb|right|R.C.

Atkinson was taught at Forest in the 1890s, who went on to be the surgeon on Scott's last, fatal Antarctic Expedition, but had the good fortune to survive himself. The school's pupil numbers and facilities continued to grow: a new Sanatorium in 1902, an extended Junior School, a new Grub Shop and in 1906 the School's Science Laboratory was built at the south end of College Place on the site of the modern Theatre.", "** Edward L.

Atkinson. The relief party took their photographic film, scientific specimens, and other materials. The bodies of Scott and his men were left in their tent, and later parties could not locate the campsite, since that area had been covered in snow. A century of storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, which are now encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it slowly inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001, glaciologist Charles R. Bentley estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75 feet (23 m) of ice and about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) from the point where they died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg."]}, {"page": "Terra Nova Expedition", "response": ["Among the other serving Royal Navy personnel released by the Admiralty were Lieutenant Harry Pennell, who would serve as navigator and take command of Terra Nova once the shore parties had landed; and two Surgeon-Lieutenants, George Murray Levick and Edward L.

Two non-Royal Navy officers were appointed: Henry Robertson Bowers (\"Birdie\"), who was a lieutenant in the Royal Indian Marine, and Lawrence Oates (\"Titus\"), an Army captain from the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons.

He ordered Cossack to torpedo Glatton in an attempt to flood the magazine before it detonated. Cossacks first  torpedo struck the anti-torpedo bulge amidships, but failed to explode because it had been fired too close to Glatton. Her second torpedo blew a hole in Glatton at 7:40, but the torpedo's  warhead was too small to penetrate through her bulge and Glatton remained afloat, still burning. Keyes transferred to the destroyer  and ordered her to fire on Glatton with her  torpedoes at 8:15. They were aimed at the hole blown in Glattons starboard side by Cossacks second torpedo and succeeded in causing Glatton to capsize until her masts and superstructure rested on the harbour bottom and dousing the fire.Buxton, p. 110 Casualties were heavy: 60 men were killed outright and 124 were injured of whom 19 later died of their burns.
