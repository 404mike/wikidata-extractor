He was educated at Lancing College and Brasenose College, Oxford.\nHe worked in Sotheby's department of historical and literary manuscripts. After winning a Winston Churchill Travelling Fellowship in 1971 he wrote a book on Armenian history which was reissued in 1990. In 1975 with the support of \"Minority Rights Group\" he published \"The Armenians\" report (co-author - prof. David Marshall Lang). In November 1989 at the Oxford University Walker had a lecture on the modern history of Armenia. He also wrote several books and articles on history of Armenia. One of his most famous works is the book Armenia: The Survival of a Nation, which has been described as an \"excellent history of Greater Armenia\" and \"a balanced presentation\" of the events during the Armenian genocide of 1895-1918.After a long-time research in archives, in 2003 Walker completed his book, Life of Oliver Baldwin, about a soldier, statesman, and journalist, the son of a Conservative Prime Minister, who became a Labour member of British Parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Armeno-Georgian War", "response": ["Historian Christopher J.

Hacikyan et al. described him as a revolutionary intellectual and pioneer of the Armenian Renaissance. Christopher J.

As Sardarabad is approximately  west of the capital of Yerevan, the battle not only halted the Ottoman advance into the rest of Armenia, but also prevented the complete destruction of the Armenian nation. In the words of Christopher J.

Walker, Moscow revisited the treaty in 1968, when it attempted to negotiate a border adjustment with Turkey in which the ruins of Ani would be transferred to Soviet Armenia in exchange for two Azerbaijani villages in the area of Mount Akbaba.

Minor clashes occurred thereafter. According to Christopher J. Walker, the fedayi came \"near to organising an uprising and shaking Ottoman power in Armenia\", but \"even then it was unthinkable that the empire would lose any of her territory, since the idea of intervention was far from Russia\". Trotsky wrote that international attention was on the Russo-Japanese War and the uprising went largely unnoticed by the European powers and Russia.", "The region was left under limited control of the Armenian Karabakh Council. The British mission under command of Thomson arrived in Karabakh in December 1918. Thomson insisted the council \"act only in local, nonpolitical matters\", which sparked discontent among the Armenians. An \"ardent pan-Turkist\" Khosrov bey Sultanov was soon appointed the governor of Karabakh and Zangezur by Thomson to \"squash any unrest in the region\". Christopher J.
