Going to Cambridge University in autumn 1958, he was picked for virtually every first-class match for the University side in 1959 season as an opening batsman and made more runs than anyone else in a pretty unsuccessful university season: the team won only one game out of 19 first-class matches. He made one of only three centuries for the team, an innings of 109 in the match against Warwickshire. With the off-spin bowler Alan Hurd a regular member of the side, Kirby's own off-spin was used sparingly, but he took 26 university wickets at an average of 27.84, which put him second in the university's averages and ahead of all the more regular bowlers. When the university term was over, he joined Leicestershire with limited success; at the end of the season, too, he was picked for the Gentlemen v Players match in the Scarborough Festival. All this cricket \u2013 and playing for two rather weak teams in a season of almost continuous sunshine, which meant he batted twice in all but one of his 27 first-class games \u2013 gave him a total of 1102 runs for the season and an average of 21.60, the lowest average of any of the 30 or so batsmen who have scored 1,000 runs in their debut season. He also took 41 wickets at an average of 26.36."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2016", "response": ["*Alan Hurd, 78, English cricketer.Alan Hurd"]}]}}
