The Academy was initially intended to be a companion for his instructional book, Tony Grey Bass Academy; however, the Academy exceeded its initial vision and has been designed to take players from the beginning of their journey through music, all the way to the very end and beyond, learning music creatively rather than mechanically\u2014a Philosophy developed by Grey, which now leads thousands of students to becoming the next generation of bass virtuosos.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of jazz bassists", "response": ["*Tony Grey (born 1975)"]}, {"page": "Hiromi Uehara", "response": ["She debuted in 2003 with her album, Another Mind, and has toured and appeared in jazz festivals regularly since then.
