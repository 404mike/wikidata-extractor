During Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Scotland in 1650, Neidpath was attacked. Mike Salter states that the castle was surrendered without a fight, although other sources suggest that it required the longest assault on any stronghold south of the River Forth to force it to surrender. James Taylor, writing in 1887, states that the 13th-century tower was demolished by artillery during the siege and the Listed building report notes that there was damage to the west wing. During the 1660s, the 2nd Earl of Tweeddale remodelled the castle, and constructed outbuildings. The 2nd Earl was an agricultural \"improver\", who planted an avenue of yews, of which one side remains. However, he was declared bankrupt, and sold Neidpath to William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry in 1686."]}, {"page": "List of nicknames of European royalty and nobility", "response": ["* The Great Historic Families of Scotland (1887) by James Taylor"]}, {"page": "James Taylor (disambiguation)", "response": ["James Taylor may refer to:", "* James Taylor (born 1948), American singer/songwriter and guitarist.", "** James Taylor (album), American folk singer's debut album", "* James Taylor (author), American fiction writer", "* James Taylor (British author and historian) (born 1963), British writer on maritime art", "* James Taylor (tenor) (born 1966), American opera singer", "* James Taylor Move, Australian psychedelic rock band", "* James Taylor Quartet, led by the British acid jazz musician James Taylor", "* James Taylor (New South Wales politician)", "* James Taylor (Queensland politician) (1820\u20131895), Queensland politician", "* James Taylor (Victorian politician) (born 1934), Victorian politician", "* James Taylor (1761\u20131834), farmer, merchant and political figure in New Brunswick", "* James Taylor (d. 1856), businessman and political figure in New Brunswick", "* James Taylor (Nova Scotia politician) (1771\u20131801), merchant and politician in Nova Scotia", "* James Taylor (New Mexico politician) (born 1966), New Mexico State Senator", "* James Taylor (Alamo defender) (c. 1814\u20131836), soldier", "* James Taylor Jr. (banker) (1769\u20131848), American Quartermaster General and banker, War of 1812, founder of Newport, Kentucky", "* James Taylor (minister) (1813\u20131892), Scottish Presbyterian minister and historical author", "* James Taylor Jr. (Exclusive Brethren) (1899\u20131970), New York leader of Raven-Taylor Exclusive Brethren assemblies", "* James Taylor (cricketer, born 1809) (1809\u2013?), English professional cricketer", "* James Taylor (cricketer, born 1846) (1846\u20131915), English cricketer", "* James Taylor (cricketer, born 1974), English cricketer", "* James Taylor (cricketer, born 1990), English Test cricketer", "* James Taylor (cricketer, born 2001), English cricketer", "* James Taylor (Scottish cricketer) (1929\u20132019), Scottish cricketer", "* James Taylor (sportsman) (1917\u20131993), English-born Scottish cricketer, umpire", "* James Taylor (cyclist), British track cyclist", "* James Taylor (sports administrator) (1871\u20131944), Australian sports administrator", "* Jay Taylor (placekicker) (James Taylor, born 1976), American football kicker", "* James Taylor, British race car driver, see 1998 International Formula 3000 season", "* James Taylor (lawyer), American lawyer who works for the Heartland Institute", "* James Taylor (neurologist) (1859\u20131946), British neurologist", "* James Taylor (tea planter) (1835\u20131892), in Sri Lanka", "* James Taylor Jr. (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Scottish inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* CurlingCurling: the ancient Scottish game, James Taylor, W.

He was living peaceably in his own mansion at Seton when the rebellion of 1715 broke out. His involvement in the rebellion was hastened by the treatment which he received from a body of the Lothian militia, who forcibly entered and rifled his mansion at Seton, as he alleged on his trial, 'through private pique and revenge.' 'The most sacred places,' he adds, 'did not escape their fury and resentment. They broke into his chapel, defaced the monuments of his ancestors, took up the stones of their sepulchres, thrust irons through their bodies, and treated them in a most barbarous, inhuman, and unchristian like manner.' After this event the Earl took up arms against the Government, assumed the command of a troop of horse mostly composed of gentlemen belonging to East Lothian, and joined the Northumbrian insurgents under Mr. Forster and the Earl of Derwentwater. Their numbers were subsequently augmented by a body of Highlanders under Brigadier Macintosh, who formed a junction with them at Kelso.James Taylor, The Great Historic Families of Scotland, The Setons (1886)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Leslie-Melville, Lord Balgonie", "response": ["*The Great Historic Families of Scotland: the Leslies of Leven (1887) by James Taylor"]}, {"page": "Robert II Keith, Marischal of Scotland", "response": ["Under Malcolm IV, the title Marischal of Scotland had been bestowed on Keith's ancestors, a title which became hereditary and was passed on from one Keith to the next.
