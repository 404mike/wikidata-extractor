After slumping to a 6\u20130 defeat mid-season at the hands of Sydney FC the Glory, and with mounting pressure on coach Kenny Lowe after entering into a battle for bottom spot on the ladder, the Glory signed Neil Kilkenny from Melbourne City whose arrival provided much needed strength in the midfield and coincided with a positive turnaround in form. After defeating eventual Grand Finalists Melbourne Victory FC and Newcastle Jets FC in the closing rounds, the Glory entered the final round with a win against the Brisbane Roar at home netting them the last spot in the finals. The Glory went down 2\u20133, slumping to 8th position on the ladder. Following a mostly unsuccessful season coach Kenny Lowe was removed as coach and CEO Peter Filopoulos resigned to move back to Victoria to take up the CEO role with Football Federation Victoria, but not before (alongside Head of Football, Jacob Burns) overseeing the appointment of new head coach, Tony Popovic. During Peter's time as CEO, membership grew by 50%, the club moved into a new training and administration HQ sharing with Western Force and the club business operations improved significantly.https://www.thewest.com.au/sport/perth-glory/perth-glory-ceo-peter-filopoulos-resigns-just-days-after-announcing-the-sacking-of-coach-kenny-lowe-ng-b88813841z.html  Kenny Lowe took up a role as technical director of the club's junior academy.

As the Highland club unsuccessfully battled against relegation in 2009, manager Terry Butcher joked that he wanted his side to achieve more league points than Tokley's total of disciplinary points.
