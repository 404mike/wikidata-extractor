At the time, there was no precedent for such a move between senior chairs at Oxford and Cambridge. Most of his work as an editor of Latin texts took place during this second period at Oxford. Working for the Oxford Classical Texts series, he produced critical editions of the complete works of Catullus (1958) and Vergil (1969), and of Pliny the Younger's Epistulae (1963). Though focusing on classical subjects, he continued to work on manuscripts as a curator at the Bodleian Library. In the 17 years he spent at the college, Mynors sought to maintain its position as a centre of excellence in the Classics and fostered contacts with a new generation of Latinists, including E. J.
