In 1600 it was purchased by Sir David Williams, MP for the Borough of Brecon (1584\u201393, 1597\u20131604). In 1613, it was inherited by his son, Sir Henry Williams, MP for the Borough of Brecon (1601\u201304) and for Breconshire (1620\u201328). His son, also Sir Henry Williams, was also MP for Breconshire (1628\u201329). On 6 August 1645, he was said to have entertained King Charles I at Gwernyfed, following Charles' defeat at the Battle of Naseby.J. Britton et al., The Beauties of England and Wales, p. 100 (1815) Curiously, Sir Edward Williams was not a relation (despite his surname), but married the family heiress in 1675. This seems to have ensured that he too became MP for Breconshire (1697\u201398, 1705\u201321). In 1776, Thomas Wood also married the family heiress. Their son, Thomas Wood, was MP for Breconshire for forty-one years (1806\u201347). He enjoyed the friendship of members of the royal family and King George IV visited him at Old Gwernyfed. The house is now a grade I listed building.", "Gwernyfed Park, a much later Jacobean-style house within the deer park, was built for Captain Thomas Wood by William Eden Nesfield in the 1870s. During the Second World War, it was requisitioned and used by the South Wales Borderers.  Since 1950, it has formed part of Gwernyfed High School. A rugby union club, Gwernyfed RFC, was founded at the school in the 1960s, but now plays at and represents the nearby town of Talgarth.
