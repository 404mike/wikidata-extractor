In September, Houchen suffered a tear in his hamstring, and struggled to regain his place upon his recovery. To replace him, Jason Beckford, younger brother of Darren, was brought in on loan from Manchester City. He proved somewhat less prolific than his sibling. The Vale only picked up one victory in nine league games, Houchen bagging a brace in a 2\u20130 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Heading into December they had lost just three games in a sequence of ten league matches. Yet from 7 December to 21 March they went on a club-record seventeen games without a win (recording ten defeats). During this spell Andy Williams played a handful of games after arriving on a loan deal from Leeds United. Colin West then joined the club on loan from West Bromwich Albion. In February, Rudge took forward Joe Allon on loan from Chelsea. The next month, winger David Lowe arrived on loan from Ipswich Town. Out went Ryan Kidd, signing for Preston North End on a free transfer. At the end of March, victories over Plymouth Argyle and Blackburn Rovers raised hopes of a last minute escape. Picking up five points in the first four games of April, their fate rested in their hands. They failed to escape the drop however, losing both to Cambridge United at the Abbey Stadium and to Grimsby Town at Vale Park.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Andy Williams", "| December 1991 || MF ||  || Andy Williams || Leeds United || February 1992 || "]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|Andy Williams"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["* Andy Williams - Rotherham United,  October"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Leeds United A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 February 1992 || MF ||  Andy Williams ||  Notts County || \u00a3115,000", "| 1 December 1991 || MF ||  Andy Williams ||  Port Vale || 1 January 1992"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Leeds United A.F.C. season", "response": ["*  Andy Williams 1"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1980s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Andy Williams"]}, {"page": "Andy Williams (footballer born 1962)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Williams (footballer, born 1962)"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Leeds United A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Andy Williams"]}]}}
