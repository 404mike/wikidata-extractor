He began the 1972\u201373 season as first choice in the centre of defence, though soon moved back to right-back in a reshuffle of the team. He was an ever-present until the local derby against Exeter City on Boxing Day 1972, but played just five games in the remainder of the season. Manager Jack Edwards was replaced by Malcolm Musgrove, and Boulton was an ever-present in 1973\u201374. The \"Gulls\" continued to battle in the bottom half of the table in 1974\u201375, before reaching ninth in 1975\u201376. Musgrove was replaced by Frank O'Farrell, who was in turn replaced by Mike Green, in a chaotic campaign in 1976\u201377. He was deployed as an emergency centre-forward at Doncaster Rovers in August 1976, and scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win. He was named the club's Player of the Season in 1976\u201377. Boulton remained a regular until the end of the 1977\u201378 season, as Torquay again finished ninth. However, he played just eleven times in the 1978\u201379 season, with his final game for Torquay coming on the final day of the season, a 1\u20130 defeat away to Rochdale. He left Plainmoor that summer, and was awarded a testimonial by Torquay with a friendly match against Southampton on 15 January 1980. In total he played 286 games for the club in league and cup competitions, scoring 36 goals.Edwards, Leigh; Jon Gibbes, John Lovis (1999).

Lewis eventually overtook Shaw and retired in 1958 having set a record of 473 appearances which stood for almost 50 years.  1958 was also the year in which Sammy Collins set the club's goalscoring record at 219, a total which has yet to be surpassed.  In the 1960s, Tommy Northcott came closest to matching both records with 150 goals in 443 games, while defender Ian Twitchin joined the elite band of players to make 400 appearances for United in 1980.
