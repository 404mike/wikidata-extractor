The Sontarans plan to terraform the Earth into a new clone world, but their plans are averted by the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant). It is also revealed that the race was excluded from the Last Great Time War of the revived series' backstory. In \"Turn Left\" (2008), the same events are depicted in a parallel universe, where Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) describes their plan as foiled by Torchwood (characters from the spin-off show of that name), at the cost of their lives, with Torchwood leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) being captured by the Sontarans. In \"The Stolen Earth\" (2008), UNIT is revealed to have developed a teleportation device based on Sontaran technology. A lone survivor from the events of \"The Poison Sky\", Commander Kaagh (Anthony O'Donnell), next appears in The Last Sontaran (2008), from spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures. Kaagh appears again in Enemy of the Bane (2008). In Doctor Whos \"The End of Time, Part Two\" (2010), a Sontaran sniper (Dan Starkey) briefly appears pursuing the Doctor's former companions Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and his wife Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), but is defeated by the Doctor before he can assassinate them. Alongside the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), Sontaran battle fleets are seen in Series 5 finale episode, \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010), as part of an alliance of the Doctor's enemies. Series 6 episode \"A Good Man Goes to War\" (2011) introduces Commander Strax (Starkey), a Sontaran nurse who has been assigned this role as a means of making penance. He fights on the side of the Doctor and his allies, which include the Silurian warrior Madame Vastra (Neve McIntosh) and her wife, Jenny Flint (Catrin Stewart). Strax then appears alongside Vastra and Jenny in \"The Snowmen\" (2012), \"The Crimson Horror\", \"The Name of the Doctor\" (both 2013), and \"Deep Breath\" (2014). A troop of Sontarans is also shown among Trenzalore's invaders in the 2013 Christmas special \"The Time of the Doctor\".
