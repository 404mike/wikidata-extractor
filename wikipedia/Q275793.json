It was created in 1859 for Samuel Cunard, the Canadian-born British shipping magnate. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his elder son Sir Edward, the second baronet. Upon the second baronet's sudden death in 1869, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Bache, the third baronet. The third baronet married Maud Cunard, by whom he had one child, Nancy Cunard, and was succeeded in the title at his death in 1925 by his younger brother Sir Gordon, the fourth baronet. The fourth baronet survived his brother by eight years; at his death in 1933, he was succeeded by his eldest son Sir Edward, the fifth baronet. The fifth baronet was a lifelong bachelor, and at his death in 1962, the senior line of descent from the first baronet failed. He was succeeded by a second cousin once removed, Sir Henry, who became the sixth baronet and was a great-great-grandson of the first baronet through his younger son William (1825\u20131906). Also a bachelor, the sixth baronet was succeeded by his younger brother Sir Guy, the seventh and last baronet, in 1973. He was likewise a bachelor and the title became extinct upon his death in 1989."]}, {"page": "The Black Book (list)", "response": ["* Nancy Cunard, writer, heiress and anti-fascist"]}, {"page": "Dingo Bar", "response": ["Others who frequented the Dingo Bar included Pablo Picasso, Aleister Crowley, Nancy Cunard and Isadora Duncan would come over from her apartment across the street."]}, {"page": "Nevill Holt", "response": ["Nevill Holt Hall is a Grade I listed building, dating back to before 1300.
