The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980s by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by Dick Poole, the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980s. A fortuitous kerbside meeting in 2007 led to the club benefiting from the coaching services of former Giro d'Italia rider Flavio Zappi. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the Scholar Gypsy affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery. The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time."]}, {"page": "List of people from Reading, Berkshire", "response": ["* Dick Poole (cyclist; first man to cycle from Land's End to John o'Groats in under two days)"]}, {"page": "Golden Book of Cycling", "response": ["* Richard William Ewart Poole (Dick Poole), Citation in 1995, aged 63."]}, {"page": "Dick Poole", "response": ["Dick Poole may refer to:", "* Dick Poole (rugby league) (born 1930), Australian former rugby league footballer and coach", "* Dick Poole (footballer) (1872\u20131939), Australian rules football player for Collingwood", "* Dick Poole (cyclist), English cyclist", "* Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes, a horse race run at Salisbury Racecourse"]}]}}
