According to the book, The Ring: Boxing The 20th Century, the cut was produced by a head-butt, in which case the judges' scorecards would have been checked, and whoever was ahead given the win by a technical decision. The referee, however, declared incorrectly that O' Grady's cut had been produced by a punch, therefore, Watt officially, but unjustly, won the fight by knockout.
