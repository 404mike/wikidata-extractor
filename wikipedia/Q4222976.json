This dependence, though most closely associated with Andrew Cecil Bradley, is clear as early as the time of Mary Cowden Clarke, who offered precise, if fanciful, accounts of the predramatic lives of Shakespeare's female leads. She suggested, for instance, that the child Lady Macbeth refers to in the first act died during a foolish military action."]}, {"page": "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "response": ["In 1863, Charles Cowden Clarke also wrote on this play. Kehler notes he was the husband of famous Shakespearean scholar Mary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class mechanicals of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with the representatives of the fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor."]}, {"page": "Henry VI, Part 1", "response": ["thumb|upright=0.70|H. C.

The illustrations often had nothing to do with the text content. The content of the text was often of poor quality and \"The American Book of Beauty\" contained a story of prison torture with an illustration of a pretty woman with a lapdog. \"The American Book of Beauty\" also has several copies of the books with portraits in different orders. One edition of the \"Heath's Book of Beauty\" was a college project and contained poems, short stories, etc. 1826 was not a good year for the annuals, because of the Panic of 1825. Thomas Hood's sarcastic poem \"The Battle of the Annuals\" was published in the 1830s. Watercolor became popular in the 1830s and the black and white etchings were the coloring books of the day. In 1842, Volume 1, page 521 of the Illustrated London News, there are sarcastic pictures poking fun at the annuals. In 1844 there was an article referring to it as imbecilic mania and finally the \"Obituary for the Annual\" appeared in the Art Journal of 1857.
