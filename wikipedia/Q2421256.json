He spent nearly all his playing career as a centre half for Luton Town.\nBorn in Birmingham to Florence Laura (n\u00e9e Whiley) and Henry Sydney Owen, Owen began his football career playing for the Birmingham YMCA team before joining Birmingham City as a youth player. After the end of the Second World War, he made it into the club's first team for the 1946\u201347 season, but played just five times in the Second Division and was allowed to leave at the end of the season.\nOwen signed for Luton in June 1947. He played 388 league games for the club and 423 in all league and cup games, and after constant displays of natural ability in the 1949\u201350 season, was appointed as captain by manager Dally Duncan. He earned three caps for the England national football team in 1954, and selected as part of the squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, at which he appeared in England's first match, a 4\u20134 draw with Belgium. He also played twice for the Football League XI.\nIn 1959, his final season as a player, Owen was named the FWA Footballer of the Year. On 27 April 1959, he was appointed as player-manager of Luton following the departure of Dally Duncan six months earlier; Owen was therefore in charge of the club for the 1959 FA Cup Final against Nottingham Forest. As well as serving as manager for the match, he also captained the side from his position at centre half.After less than a year in the job, a \"fundamental disagreement on policy\" led to his resignation on 23 April 1960. He later became first team coach of Leeds United under Jack Taylor and then Don Revie throughout the 1960s and 1970s, bringing with him trainer Les Cocker.In 1978, he was hired by Manchester United manager Dave Sexton to be the club's youth coach. He remained in the position for three years until shortly after Sexton's departure from the club at the end of the 1980\u201381 season. Owen is credited with spotting the potential of Mark Hughes as a striker, having selected him for the youth team during his final season working at Old Trafford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "England national football team", "response": ["Their first defeat on home soil to a foreign team was a 2\u20130 loss to Ireland, on 21 September 1949 at Goodison Park. A 6\u20133 loss in 1953 to Hungary, was their second defeat by a foreign team at Wembley. In the return match in Budapest, Hungary won 7\u20131. This stands as England's largest ever defeat. After the game, a bewildered Syd Owen said, \"it was like playing men from outer space\". In the 1954 FIFA World Cup, England reached the quarter-finals for the first time, and lost 4\u20132 to reigning champions Uruguay."]}, {"page": "Luton Town F.C.", "response": ["During the early 1950s, one of Luton's greatest sides emerged under manager Dally Duncan. The team included Gordon Turner, who went on to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, Bob Morton, who holds the record for the most club appearances, and Syd Owen, an England international. During this period, Luton sides also featured two England international goalkeepers, Ron Baynham and Bernard Streten, as well as Irish internationals Seamus Dunne, Tom Aherne and George Cummins. This team reached the top flight for the first time in 1955\u201356, after finishing the season in second place behind Birmingham City on goal average. A few years of success followed, including an FA Cup Final appearance against Nottingham Forest in 1958\u201359; at the end of the season, Owen was voted FWA Footballer of the Year. However, the club was relegated the following season and, by 1964\u201365, was playing in the fourth tier."]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["Leeds struggled in the 1961\u201362 season, as aside from Billy Bremner and Jack Charlton his playing squad was filled with journeymen pros; he did though inherit a good coaching staff that included Les Cocker, Maurice Lindley and Syd Owen who would all spend many years with Revie at Leeds. He developed a youth policy at the club, notable graduates of which would be Eddie Gray, Norman Hunter, Peter Lorimer and Paul Reaney. He had a difficult task in persuading young players to join Leeds over more glamorous clubs but made sure he put in extra effort to make the youngsters feel happy at Leeds, and in one instance drove to Scotland to talk to Bremner's girlfriend to successfully persuade her to encourage Bremner to stay at Leeds rather than return to Scotland to be with her. Revie played his last game in March 1962 before concentrating entirely on management.", "Leeds struggled at the start of the 1966\u201367 season, though despite winning just three of their opening eleven games they went on to finish in fourth place. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 1\u20130 to Chelsea at Villa Park. They reached the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Yugoslavian side GNK Dinamo Zagreb, but were unable to scout the opposition due to Syd Owen having his flight cancelled on him; Leeds lost 2\u20130 on aggregate and Revie was criticised for his negative tactics."]}]}}
