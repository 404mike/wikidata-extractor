Her ten varied novels, set mostly in her native Radnorshire, concern rural communities and heroines. Her first was The Battle to the Weak (1925), her last The Candle and the Light (1954). She was married to the writer Charles Langbridge Morgan, who had an influence on her writings. Although favourably received by her contemporaries, Vaughan's works later received minimal attention. Rediscovery began in the 1980s and 1990s, along with a renewed interest in Welsh literature in English as a whole.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1985 in literature", "response": ["*November 4 \u2013 Hilda Vaughan, Welsh novelist and short story writer (born 1892)"]}, {"page": "Charles Langbridge Morgan", "response": ["Charles Langbridge Morgan (22 January 1894 \u2013 6 February 1958) was a British playwright and novelist of English and Welsh parentage.
