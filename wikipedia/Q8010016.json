G. Bagnall in 1875. Bagnall wrote to the Duke offering to hire his first locomotive for trials. On 18 December 1876 the locomotive, Buckingham, was delivered. It entered service on 1 January 1877, mainly on the steep section of the line between Wotton and Brill. Jones was unhappy with some aspects of Buckingham, but recognised the improvement and ordered a locomotive from Bagnall for \u00a3640 (about \u00a3 in ). Wotton was delivered on 28 December 1877 and Buckingham was returned to Bagnall in February 1878."]}]}}
