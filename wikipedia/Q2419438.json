He was born in Dartford, Kent. During his career with the club, which lasted 11 years from 1945 to 1957, he scored 145 league goals, which placed him seventh on the club's list of all-time goalscorers.

Although he suffered from a case of appendicitis during the year, he scored 14 times in 23 matches, including hat-tricks against Doncaster Rovers and Fulham. In October 1953, having been plagued by knee problems, Dudley moved to the First Division for the first time in his career, joining Cardiff City in exchange for Bobby McLaughlin. He made his debut for the Bluebirds on 24 October 1953 during a 3\u20130 defeat to Burnley but made just four further appearances for the club, scoring once during a 5\u20130 victory over Charlton Athletic, as a persistent knee injury and the signing of Welsh international Trevor Ford saw him unable to break into the first-team. He left the club after just four months to sign for Brentford."]}, {"page": "Wilf Grant", "response": ["He made his debut for the \"Saints\" in a Second Division game away to West Bromwich Albion on 5 October 1946 on the left wing, where he soon became settled, scoring a brace in a 5\u20131 victory over Plymouth Argyle on 26 October. Manager Bill Dodgin preferred him on the right, however, (where he replaced Billy Bevis), teaming up with the ageing Bill Rochford. This role was not to Grant's liking and his form slumped. Although he was transfer-listed in August 1948, he remained with Southampton for the next two seasons, used occasionally as replacement for Eric Day. In 1948\u201349 he seemed settled back on the left before he lost his place to Bill Heaton. After a rather frustrating time, he joined Cardiff City in March 1950 with Ernie Stevenson coming to the south coast in exchange. In his four seasons at The Dell he made 64 appearances scoring 13 goals."]}, {"page": "List of Southampton F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Eric Day", "|Eric Day", "|Eric Day", "|Eric Day", "|Eric Day", "|Eric Day", "|Eric Day"]}, {"page": "Jack Bradley (footballer)", "response": ["On the resumption of League football in 1946, Bradley became the established inside left, with either Doug McGibbon or George Lewis at centre-forward.
