Read is  a reader in philosophy at the University of East Anglia where he has been awarded \u2013 as Principal Investigator \u2013 Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funding for two projects on \"natural capital\". His other major recent academic focus has been on the precautionary principle, having contributed substantially to work co-authored with Nassim Nicholas Taleb on applying the principle to questions of genetic modification of organisms. In further work, Read has theorised the utility of the precautionary principle in a wide range of areas, including: climate change, the environment, as well as financial and technology sectors.Read's application of the precautionary principle in climate and environmental affairs underlies many of his talks and presentations, notably including \"Shed a Light \u2013 This civilisation is finished: so what is to be done?\" which was given at Churchill College, Cambridge and has gained success on YouTube with over 100,000 views.In June 2018, Read triggered a BBC policy shift by publicly refusing to debate with a climate change sceptic. This led to new policy that meant the BBC would no longer present climate change sceptics' views as a counterbalance to scientific standpoints.In October 2018, Read declared his support for Extinction Rebellion. Acting as Extinction Rebellion's spokesperson, he gave a number of interviews on national news programmes during the Rebellion's London protests in April 2019 (see below). Read was part of the five members of the group invited to meet with Environment Secretary Michael Gove to discuss their demands. The following day the UK Parliament declared a \"climate change emergency\"; part of Extinction Rebellion's demands.Read commented regularly through the Eastern Daily Press \"One World Column\" for five years. In his regular appearances in the local and national press, he speaks on sustainable transport, green economics, and social justice. He was formerly chair of the Green House thinktank, a former Green Party spokesperson for transport and former East of England party co-ordinator.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Social science", "response": ["* Phil Hutchinson, Rupert Read and Wes Sharrock (2008).

The New Wittgenstein, Routledge, 2000. This so-called \"resolute reading\" is controversial and much debated. Read, Rupert, and Matthew A. Lavery, eds. Beyond the Tractatus wars: the new Wittgenstein debate. Routledge, 2012. The main contention of such readings is that Wittgenstein in the Tractatus does not provide a theoretical account of language that relegates ethics and philosophy to a mystical realm of the unsayable. Rather, the book has a therapeutic aim. By working through the propositions of the book the reader comes to realize that language is perfectly suited to all our needs, and that philosophy rests on a confused relation to the logic of our language. The confusion that the Tractatus seeks to dispel is not a confused theory, such that a correct theory would be a proper way to clear the confusion, rather the need of any such theory is confused. The method of the Tractatus is to make the reader aware of the logic of our language as we are already familiar with it, and the effect of thereby dispelling the need for a theoretical account of the logic of our language spreads to all other areas of philosophy. Thereby the confusion involved in putting forward e.g. ethical and metaphysical theories is cleared in the same coup."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (R\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Rupert Read"]}, {"page": "Media Lens", "response": ["In February 2012, the philosopher Rupert Read criticised Media Lens' use of Michel Chossudovsky and articles by Robert Dreyfuss and Aisling Byrne as sources for the situation in Syria.
