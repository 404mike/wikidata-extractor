Early in the transfer window, youngsters Ryan Mason and Steven Caulker joined Yeovil Town on loan for six months, followed soon by Adel Taarabt returning to Queens Park Rangers for a season-long loan. The transfers continued, as Troy Archibald-Henville rejoined Exeter City until January 2010, and on the same day, it was revealed that goalkeeper Ben Alnwick would join newly relegated Norwich City for three months. After this, young Adam Smith joined Wycombe Wanderers for an initial one-month deal, subsequently followed by the development of the deal to send Andros Townsend to long-term affiliate Leyton Orient for a period of six months. After a good pre-season with Spurs, midfielder Jake Livermore signed for Derby County for a period of a month but later extended to six thanks to a series of good performances. Jon Obika joined his fellow Spurs loanees at Yeovil in mid-August, putting pen to paper for an initial one-month loan. The loans continued with Jamie O'Hara joining Portsmouth until January 2010, in an effort to get first team football, followed later by the loan of midfielder Sam Cox to Cheltenham for one month. The last loans of the summer transfer window involved three youth goalkeepers, with David Button, Oscar Jansson and Lee Butcher joining Crewe Alexandra, Exeter and Grays Athletic respectively.", "The departures from Tottenham overshadowed the rest of the club's dealings both in terms of number and profile. The first sale involved the youngster Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pekhart, having just returned from a 12-month loan deal with Slavia Prague. Pekhart quickly joined Czech outfit Baumit Jablonec for an undisclosed fee. The only other outright leaving in January belonged to Troy Archibald-Henville, who after two successful loan spells with Exeter moved to Saint James' Park permanently, again for an undisclosed fee.", "|1 February 2010 || Troy Archibald-Henville||Exeter City||Undisclosed", "| 24 July 2009 || Troy Archibald-Henville||Exeter City||24 January 2010"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|29||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Troy Archibald-Henville"]}, {"page": "2007 HKFC International Soccer Sevens", "response": ["* Tottenham Hotspur: Tommy Forecast, Troy Archibald-Henville, Philip Ifil, Leigh Mills, Jacques Maghoma, Jamie O'Hara, Charlie Daniels, David Hutton, Andy Barcham, Lee Barnard"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["|DF || ||5 ||Troy Archibald-Henville || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2", "|DF || ||5 ||Troy Archibald-Henville || 6 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 7 || 0", "|align=\"center\"| Fans Player of the Year ||align=\"center\"| Troy Archibald-Henville", "|align=\"center\"| East Devon Grecians' Player of the Year ||align=\"center\"| Troy Archibald-Henville"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Troy Archibald-Henville || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1", "| Troy Archibald-Henville || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0", "| Troy Archibald-Henville"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["| Troy Archibald-Henville"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Troy Archibald-Henville", "| Troy Archibald-Henville || 4 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 4 || 2", "| Troy Archibald-Henville", "| Troy Archibald-Henville", "| Troy Archibald-Henville"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["|30|| ||DF ||Troy Archibald-Henville|| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0", "| Troy Archibald-Henville"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["*14 June 2014: Reports suggest that out-of-contract Town defender Troy Archibald-Henville has been offered to other clubs by his representatives while contract negotiations continue.", "| Troy Archibald-Henville"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["|2 July 2014||DF|| Troy Archibald-Henville|| Swindon Town||Free||", "|rowspan=7| 12|| DF || ||6 ||Troy Archibald-Henville || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|7 || ||DF ||Troy Archibald-Henville|| 6 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 6 || 2"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["||DF || ||20 ||Troy Archibald-Henville || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2", "|20 || ||DF ||Troy Archibald-Henville|| 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 0"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July || CB ||  || Troy Archibald-Henville || Exeter City  || Released || "]}]}}
