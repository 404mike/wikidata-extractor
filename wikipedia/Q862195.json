At the Malta Olympiad of 1980, Hook won the gold medal on board 1 for best percentage result of any national team member. He defeated a grandmaster and several national champions along the way. To commemorate this achievement the British Virgin Islands issued a stamp in his honor.\nDuring the preliminary rounds of the 1970 Siegen Olympiad, the Virgin Islands were paired with the USA team and Hook famously faced the legendary Bobby Fischer. Playing the black pieces, Hook ventured a pet line of the French Defence whereupon an exciting encounter developed, culminating in a stylish rook sacrifice by Fischer.Hook authored a book as well as various magazine and newspaper articles about chess. In the art world, he is known for his one-man shows in painting and photography. He lived in Washington DC, with his wife Mimi, until his death on May 10, 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chess players", "response": ["* Bill Hook (US, British Virgin Islands, 1925\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "Stuart Wagman", "response": ["Wagman attained the FIDE Master title in his sixties, and maintained a high level of play well into his eighties.
