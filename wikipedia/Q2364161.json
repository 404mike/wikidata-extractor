The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve.

The story is set in the same time and place as the programme's first episode, \"An Unearthly Child\", where Coal Hill School employed original companions Ian and Barbara and the Doctor's granddaughter Susan was enrolled. The Totter's Lane junkyard also reappears, as it had in season 22's Attack of the Cybermen, though \"I.M. Foreman\" is misspelled \"I.M. Forman\". It originally read \"L.M.\", though that was changeable in production. In one of the classrooms, Ace picks up a book on the French Revolution just as Susan had in \"An Unearthly Child\"; Aldred studied the original to try to mimic Carole Ann Ford's stature. The Doctor references the events of The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964), Genesis of the Daleks (1975), Terror of the Zygons (1975), and The Web of Fear (1968), as well as likening a device to something he used in Planet of the Daleks (1973). The Doctor mistakenly calls Captain Gilmore \"Brigadier\", a reference to the character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, who headed UNIT, an organization similar to Gilmore's. Rachel, a scientific advisor from Cambridge, is similar to Liz Shaw, and she shares a conversation with Gilmore that is reminiscent of a conversation between the Brigadier and Liz in Spearhead from Space (1970). Rachel also bears a physical resemblance to Barbara. Remembrance of the Daleks is also notable for containing a meta-reference; a television continuity announcer says, \"This is BBC television, the time is quarter past five and Saturday viewing continues with an adventure in the new science fiction series Doc\u2014\", but is cut off by a scene change before completing the title. Aaronovitch \"couldn't resist\" the reference, and clarified that it was meant as a joke and was not to be taken seriously. Originally, it was intended that the show that was introduced would be called Professor X. In addition, Alison and Rachel make mention of a \"Bernard\" from the \"British Rocket Group\".

Her teachers were Miss Lola McGovern, a 24-year-old timid woman capable of sudden courage, and Cliff, a \"physically perfect, strong and courageous\" man. Bridget was renamed Suzan/Suzanne Foreman, later changed to Susan, and writer Anthony Coburn made her the Doctor's granddaughter to avoid any possibility of sexual impropriety implicit in having a young girl travelling with an older man; Newman was reluctant about the idea, as he wanted the character to have human naivety. Miss McGovern later became history teacher Miss Canning, and Susan's birth name briefly became \"Findooclare\". When the show's bible was written, the two teachers were renamed Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. Chesterton was much more violent in earlier drafts of the script.
