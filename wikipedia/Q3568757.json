In 1936\u201337 he formed a useful partnership with fellow half-backs Bill Kennedy and Cyril King and only missed one game, although Southampton struggled near the bottom of the Second Division. He briefly became team captain until, in September 1937, new manager Tom Parker acquired the services of Scottish international Frank Hill, who had won the Football League title three times with Arsenal (in 1932\u201333, 1933\u201334 and 1934\u201335).

Once King got back into the side in December he played in the remainder of the season's matches.

His debut for the Saints came on 5 September 1936, in the first Second Division match played at Villa Park, which ended in a 4\u20130 defeat. Whitelaw retained his place at right-half in the Southampton team, where he combined well with fellow half-backs, Bill Kennedy and Billy Kingdon, until December when he lost his place to Cyril King. Although he made one further appearance at the end of the season, he was not offered a new contract and left the club in May 1937, winding up his career at non-league Kidderminster Harriers."]}, {"page": "William Kennedy (coach)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Kennedy (Scottish footballer)"]}]}}
