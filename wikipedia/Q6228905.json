A member of a large and highly successful racing family Day was sometimes known as Young John Day or John Day, Jr. to distinguish him from his father John Barham Day. The younger John Day had some success as a jockey before taking over from his father as the trainer at the Danebury stables in 1847. In a training career of over thirty years Day sent out the winners of twelve classics including three winners of The Derby. Like many trainers of his time, Day was a heavy gambler and clashed on several occasions with other leading turf figures.", "link_mentions": {}}}
