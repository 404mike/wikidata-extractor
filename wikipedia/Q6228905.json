He stayed at Findon under William Goater, who took over the trainer's licence. He became secretary and in many ways manager of the establishment on behalf of Mr Padwick, and one cannot help but wonder how, by the age of 17, he had achieved the knowledge and the confidence to take on such a complex role and handle it with the skill, talent, erudition and integrity that led to the great career that followed."]}, {"page": "Andover (horse)", "response": ["Andover was offered for sale as a yearling and was bought by the former prize-fighter John Gully who owned the colt in partnership with Henry Padwick (also known as Mr Howard).

William Day, the trainer's son, writing some years later, gave a different account. According to William, his father bought the foal and mare direct from Bouverie for 250 guineas, and Gully was never more than the part-owner of the horse.

For much of his career he was usually known simply as John Day; when his son of the same name rose to prominence, the older man was referred to as John Barham Day, John Day, Sr. or Old John Day. A member of a highly successful racing family, Day first made his name as a jockey in the 1820s and rode the winners of sixteen classics before retiring. In the mid-1830s he set up as a trainer of racehorses at Danebury near Stockbridge. He established a reputation as a shrewd and skillful handler of horses and specialised in landing betting coups. Horses trained by Day won seven classics between 1838 and 1854, during which time he was regarded as the leading trainer in the South of England and the main rival of the Yorkshire-based John Scott. He was known as \"Honest John\", but the sobriquet appears to have been applied ironically.", "Day was born in 1793 at Houghton Down in Hampshire, the son of a horse trainer named John Day: Barham was his mother's maiden name. Four of Day's brothers became jockeys, including Samuel Day (1802\u20131866) who rode three winners of The Derby.", "Day had twelve children with his first wife, and four of them achieved success on the turf. Samuel Goddard Day (c.1818\u20131838), not to be confused with his uncle, was a talented jockey who won the St Leger on Mango in 1837 but died after a hunting accident eight months later at the age of 19. John Day (1819\u20131883) had his biggest success as a jockey when riding The Ugly Buck for his father. As a trainer he took over the Danebury stable and eclipsed his father's success by winning twelve classics including three Derbys with Pyrrhus the First, Cossack and Andover. William Day (1823\u20131908) trained at Woodyates and was responsible for sending out Lord of the Isles to beat St Hubert in the 1855 2000 Guineas, the race which effectively ended his father's career. He trained two other classic winners, but his best horse was the American-bred Foxhall, which won the Grand Prix de Paris, Cesarewitch Handicap and Cambridgeshire Handicap in 1881. John Barham Day lived with William during his retirement. A fourth son, Alfred Day (born 1830), nicknamed \"King Alfred\", was a successful jockey, winning seven classics between 1849 and 1859, including the Derby on Andover. John Barham Day's granddaughter Catherine went on to marry Tom Cannon, Sr. who took over the running of Danebury and fathered four sons - Morny, Kempton, Tom Jr. and Charles who all became successful jockeys, and a daughter Margaret, who was grandmother to Lester Piggott."]}, {"page": "William Day (horseman)", "response": ["Day was one of twelve children of the jockey and trainer John Barham Day, making him the nephew of the jockey Sam Day.

There he was mentored by the jockey George Fordham, who was nine years his senior.  Day provided Cannon with first classic win in the 1866 1,000 Guineas aboard a filly called Repulse. He also rode for his younger brother, Joseph Cannon and was associated with the stables of John Porter and James Ryan.

When eventually he retired again, he trained on a small scale at Ascot."]}]}}
