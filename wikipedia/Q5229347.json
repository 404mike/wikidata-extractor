McIntosh spent almost ten years at Sheffield Wednesday, playing a total of 308 games for the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trevor Ford", "response": ["He made an impressive start for Sunderland, scoring a hat-trick on his home debut at Roker Park against Sheffield Wednesday, including a typically physical finish for one goal, taking Wednesday goalkeeper Dave McIntosh across the line with the ball, and later breaking a post with one effort. Despite being the most expensive footballer in British history, Ford continued to work as a car salesman for the Sunderland chairman in his spare time after training to earn extra money. In March 1951, Ford's record transfer fee was broken, following the transfer of Jackie Sewell from Notts County to Sheffield Wednesday for a fee of \u00a334,500. Ford revealed that he was relieved that the record had been broken having described the fee as \"weighing heavy on his shoulders\". During the 1952\u201353 season, the club turned down a bid from Italian side Fiorentina for Ford. Ford had been keen on completing the transfer, which would have seen the him earning \u00a32,000 a year each with a \u00a335 match win bonus as well as the club buying each player a house."]}, {"page": "David McIntosh", "response": ["* Dave McIntosh (1925\u20131995), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Tin Can Trust", "response": ["*Dave McIntosh \u2013 music business affairs"]}]}}
