Robbie Keane was recruited early in 2010 on a loan deal from Tottenham Hotspur amid great excitement, however further poor results, particularly a record 4\u20130 defeat by St Mirren, led to Mowbray being sacked on 25 March.

Chisholm suffered 3\u20132 defeats against both Celtic and Hibernian in his first two matches in charge.  The following week, however, Chisholm's team triumphed over Hibernian, Rangers and Hearts. United then went on to end a run of eight games over three years without a win against neighbours Dundee, with goals by Mark Wilson and Jim McIntyre sealing a 2\u20131 win. These results meant that Chisholm won the SPL manager of the month award in his first full month in charge of the team (April 2005). Chisholm's team then retained SPL status in dramatic style with a late Barry Robson penalty at Inverness on the final day of the season."]}, {"page": "Scott McDonald", "response": ["McDonald made his competitive debut for Celtic in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League third qualifying-round match against Spartak Moscow at Luzhniki Stadium, assisting Paul Hartley for Celtic's goal as the game finished 1\u20131. His first goal for the club came in the second leg of the tie at Celtic Park. A mistake by Spartak defender Roman Shishkin allowed McDonald to slip in and hit the ball first time past Stipe Pletikosa. This match also ended 1\u20131, but Celtic won 4\u20133 on penalties. Just days later in an away league match against St Mirren, McDonald latched onto a long Gary Caldwell pass to lob Chris Smith from a tight angle and score his first SPL goal for the club. He followed that up with the winning goal in the final minute of their 2\u20131 UEFA Champions League group-stage win against A.C. Milan on 3 October and another last minute winner just days later at Gretna. In a pulsating clash with Old Firm rivals Rangers on 16 April 2008, McDonald set up his Dutch strike partner Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink for a last minute goal that kept Celtic in the 2007\u201308 SPL title race, before scoring a double and winning a penalty scored by Barry Robson in another vital 3\u20132 Old Firm victory eleven days later. At the end of the season, McDonald was rewarded with a new five-year deal at Parkhead and was nominated for SPL Player of the Year. He scored 25 goals in 36 league appearances in his first season at Celtic and was the top goalscorer during the 2007\u201308 season, beating the next highest goalscorer and strike partner Vennegoor of Hesselink by 10 goals. This breakthrough season included two hat-tricks; against Dundee United and former club Motherwell. In total, McDonald scored 31 times in his first season at Parkhead.", "In early January 2010, Celtic rejected a transfer bid from Premier League side Wigan Athletic for the Australian striker, but on 1 February \u2013 transfer deadline day \u2013 Celtic sold McDonald to Middlesbrough for a reported \u00a33.5 million. He joined up with Gordon Strachan, whom he played under at Celtic and Southampton, and also rejoined four of his former teammates, Willo Flood, Barry Robson, Chris Killen and Stephen McManus. On 16 February 2010, he missed a penalty against Blackpool in a 2\u20130 loss. McDonald scored his first Middlesbrough goal in the Tyne-Tees derby against Newcastle on 13 March.

Binya was subsequently given a six match European ban following the dangerous challenge. Celtic finished second in their Champions League group with nine points. They were drawn with Barcelona in the last 16, but Brown missed the 3\u20132 defeat in the first leg through suspension. He returned for the second leg at the Camp Nou, which Celtic lost 1\u20130. Brown was suspended for three league matches, including two Old Firm games, in April 2008. Due to this suspension, manager Gordon Strachan chose a midfield pairing of Barry Robson and Paul Hartley for the final weeks of the season. Brown made a total of 48 appearances for Celtic in his first season with the club, scoring three goals."]}, {"page": "Gary Caldwell", "response": ["During the 2009\u201310 season, however, Caldwell had a contract dispute with the club, claiming that the club were \"kidding themselves\" if they thought he would accept their offer.

Subsequent to this, Middlesbrough had a joint offer for Caldwell and Barry Robson accepted by Celtic."]}, {"page": "Paul Hartley", "response": ["Gordon Strachan usually employed Hartley, who had played as an attacking midfielder for Hearts, in a more defensive role. Hartley was one of Celtic's key players in the defence of their league title at the end of the 2007\u201308 season in which Celtic had to win all seven of their remaining matches, two against arch-rivals Rangers.

He had to wait a further four months to make his home debut, during a 1\u20131 draw with Kilmarnock on 18 January 2014.

Celtic lost 1\u20130 to Milan, but still qualified for the last 16 as runners-up in their group after Benfica defeated Shakhtar in Ukraine.
