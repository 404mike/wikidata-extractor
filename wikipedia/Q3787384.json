November 1896) was a late Victorian British writer who created works mainly in the genres of the essay, short story, and novella.  He also wrote limited amounts of literary criticism. After dying early and under mysterious circumstances, his name is now little known and has all but vanished from conventional literary biographies of the period. Crackanthorpe is usually associated with the literary movement of naturalism.  His literary legacy consists largely of three volumes of short stories he managed to publish during his lifetime; contemporary opinions of his talent as a writer varied widely, though one of his works was published with an appreciation by Henry James.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford period poetry anthologies", "response": ["Also, prose by: Sir Max Beerbohm \u2013 Samuel Erewhon Butler \u2013 Hubert Crackanthorpe \u2013 Richard Garnett \u2013 Sir W.
