Seymour went to school with Clegg and Compo but lost touch when he went to grammar school (in Series 10, episode 5, 'Downhill Racer', Nora Batty undermines Edie's bragging about Seymour's intellect by pointing out that their grandmother was on the Education Committee).As indicated in the prequel series 'First of the Summer Wine' and the ninth series episode 'When you take a good bite, Yorkshire tastes terrible', Whereas Cyril and Foggy tried to solve the problems of the residents of Holmfirth, when Seymour was around he always liked to invent, but the resulting inventions invariably led to disaster \u2014 especially for Compo, who was always the reluctant test subject and called him a twit whenever anything went disastrously wrong. Despite this, he was well-liked by the other two and was more willing to play along with their childish antics than his predecessors.

Although he publicly claims to hate Nora Batty, he feels it is his duty to try to bring some joy to her life, often in the form of practical jokes similar to those Compo once played on her. In the 26th series (aired in 2005) he joined the main trio thus making them a quartet (this was largely to compensate for Clegg's decreasing role) but following the 27th series (aired in 2006) following Billy Hardcastle's departure the quartet once again became a trio although in the 28th & 29th series (aired in 2007 and 2008) he was mostly teamed up with Entwistle.

Upon first arriving in the village, Hobbo recruits Alvin and Entwistle to form a small band of volunteers who will react to any emergency that arises in the village, thus forming a new trio (with Hobbo taking Truly's role in the trio). Hobbo is incredibly cautious, and always on the lookout for enemy attack. He fondly remembers his time spent with MI5, when he used to leap from aeroplanes (\"Holding crates of milk?\" asks Entwistle) and dive for cover from enemy fire. Throughout his time on the show Hobbo is convinced that Nelly is his mother and he frequently bothers her (or uses other people) for attention, much to her annoyance.

Generally the wisest and most level-headed of the show's female social circle, she was also on occasion a target of Compo's unwanted affection, who often said that if it wasn't for Nora Batty, he'd be all over her. This regularly resulted in Compo along with the others (sometimes including Sid) being thrown out or being on the receiving end of her anger in other ways. In earlier episodes she was shown to tolerate the main trio more when they visited the caf\u00e9. In widowhood she became stricter with them, although after Compo's death she became more amused by their antics.

Edie says the line \"Pegden residence, the lady of the house speaking\" in order to seem of a higher class. This would later be used by Clarke word-perfect for Hyacinth's catchphrase \"Bucket residence, the lady of the house speaking\".

During his first appearance he was almost entirely referred to by everyone else as his real name \"Clem\". The character was popular enough to be brought back on a semi-regular basis, and was a regular throughout the 1990s and most of the 2000s (although his dog died between his first and second appearances). In some early appearances, he was a lollipop man, but for much of his time on the show worked for Auntie Wainwright, with whom he seems to be suffering some sort of indentured servitude. In early appearances, Smiler was also a lodger with Nora Batty, which enraged the jealous Compo. Smiler once described that working for Nora Batty was like being in the Army again, and always on Jankers. He also described it akin to jail at Stalag 14. Smiler also owned a big, but rather beaten up and poorly maintained, white convertible 1972 Chevrolet Impala, in which he sometimes drove around with Tom, and which on occasion has been used in various promotions for Auntie Wainwright. The trio would often cross paths with Smiler and use him for whatever scheme or activity they were doing (largely because of his tall height and gormless nature). Smiler was last seen in the series 28 episode \"Sinclair and the Wormley Witches\". Lewis left the show at the end of series 28 because of ill health.
