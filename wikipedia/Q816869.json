He did not turn to composition until his early 30s, but his first acknowledged work, Hinterstoisser Traverse (1986), attracted attention from the European new music scene (Toop 2001). His early works are decidedly postmodern in inclination, with considerable use of stylistic irony (some commentators have noted in these works a similarity to the music of Mauricio Kagel). Mason then developed an interest in polyrhythmic music, and in works such as his Double Concerto one can hear a strong stylistic affinity to the later works of Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti (Toop 2001). More recent works have concentrated on the spatial dimension of music, such as in his Music for European Concert Halls series, and sometimes have come very close to installation art.\nMason has composed in many genres, and his soccer opera Playing Away, with a libretto by Howard Brenton, was commissioned by the Munich Biennale and premi\u00e8red there in 1994 by Opera North (Anon. 1994).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Benedict Mason || 1954 || ||  British  ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Flexatone", "response": ["* Benedict Mason - Lighthouses of England and Wales (1987) and Double Concerto (1989)Holland (2005), p.151."]}, {"page": "Opera North", "response": ["Opera North has given world premi\u00e8res of the following operas: Rebecca by Wilfred Josephs (1983), Caritas by Robert Saxton (1991), Baa, Baa, Black Sheep by Michael Berkeley (1993), Playing Away by Benedict Mason (1994),  The Nightingale's to Blame by Simon Holt (1998), Jonathan Dove's The Adventures of Pinocchio (2007) and Swanhunter (2009), and Skin Deep by David Sawer and Armando Iannucci (2009).
