You have to be a member of the local federation, of course, but assuming you are selected, you play for your present home country. So far so good. Now consider Ireland. The two parts are different states, but under a special agreement, the island enters one team for European championships. Leaving aside history, this makes a certain kind of sense... England. Scotland and Wales are each able to enter their own teams for European championships. Home internationals are played between teams from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Constitutionally, the only countries (in the sense of members of the European Union) are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. So the next question is: what do we want the categories to do? If they record where people were born, that is do-able, but perhaps not very useful. On the other hand, if we want categories to show which countries they played for, you could easily have a person playing for several countries. They might hold several passports as well. Probably, given that the various parts of GB can each enter teams, you should go for separate categories for the parts of the UK, and list individuals according to their known life patterns.
