His live performances consist largely of his own unreleased compositions, and he is noted for scratching his own sounds over his music, creating a live element of turntablism stemming from prowess early in his career as a vinyl DJ.\nTipper is widely respected as a surround sound composer, releasing one of the first albums composed, produced, and intended for the DualDisc format, in addition to providing content for multichannel music industry leaders DTS, Inc.. His talents at sound design (his work is included in several of the major music making software programs), and in digital audio mastering, are also in great demand. His catalogue has been consistently licensed for use as background in a variety of mainstream television programmes, and also featured in commercials and cable television projects.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wimbledon, London", "response": ["*David Tipper (born 1976), producer, composer, DJ"]}, {"page": "Glitch (music)", "response": ["Glitch hop took shape around the year 1997 from the early works of Push Button Objects at the label Chocolate Industries.  In 2001 the genre gained popularity thanks to labels like Merck Records, Warp Records, and Ghostly International. Notable glitch hop artists include Machinedrum, Dabrye, Prefuse 73, edIT, Jimmy Edgar, Lackluster, and Proswell. In the late 2000s, glitch hop experienced a massive decline in content creation as practitioners of the genre began branching out into other genres. During this time, dubstep was arguably the most profitable EDM genre in the United States. Hence, many glitch hop artists began making a new style of electronic music that used the same aesthetic as dubstep, while incorporating some elements of glitch music (low fidelity manipulation, stutters, beat repeat, pitched reverses, and cuts). Instead of renaming their new genre, the artists kept the name glitch-hop.  Modern glitch hop artists routinely receive criticism for using the term glitch-hop when the current style of the musical genre does not sound like a glitch or instrumental hip hop. Despite the criticism received from traditional glitch-hop fans, many glitch hop artists have had profitable careers. Popular modern glitch hop artists include David Tipper, The Glitch Mob, KOAN Sound, Pegboard Nerds, Pretty Lights, GRiZ, TheFatRat, and Hefe Heetroc."]}, {"page": "Brocken spectre", "response": ["\"Brocken Spectre\" is the title of a track on David Tipper's 2010 album Broken Soul Jamboree."]}, {"page": "Higher Ground", "response": ["* Higher Ground, a 2007 album by David Tipper"]}, {"page": "Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017", "response": ["* St. Louis\u00a0\u2013 David Tipper hosted his Tipper & Friends 4321 electronic music event at Astral Valley Art Park featuring 5 days of music, art, and eclipse viewing."]}, {"page": "Rainbow Serpent Festival", "response": ["2010 \u2013 Robert Babicz, David Tipper"]}, {"page": "Dave tipper", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Tipper"]}, {"page": "Dave Tipper", "response": ["#redirect David Tipper"]}, {"page": "Gothic Theatre", "response": ["The Gothic has hosted many distinguished shows since its opening.
