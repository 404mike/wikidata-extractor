This machine was similar to the Mark I, except that it did not include Williams tubes and used only the magnetic drum for main memory. The machine was based on a 48-bit word, although 4 bits were used for timing and thus not available for program use. This machine used thermionic valves to generate a clock frequency of 125 kHz."]}, {"page": "2005 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 6 December \u2013 Richard Grimsdale, electrical engineer, builder of the first transistorised computer (born 1929)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2005", "response": ["*Richard Grimsdale, 76, British electrical engineer, built the world's first transistorised computer and was at the forefront of work on Read Only Memory."]}, {"page": "1929 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Richard Grimsdale, electrical engineer (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "History of the transistor", "response": ["The world's first transistor computer was built at the University of Manchester in November 1953. The computer was built by Richard Grimsdale, then a research student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and later a Professor of Electronic Engineering at Sussex University. The machine used point-contact transistors, made in small quantities by STC and Mullard. These consisted of a single crystal of germanium with two fine wires, resembling the crystal and cat's whisker of the 1920s. These transistors had the useful property that a single transistor could possess two stable states. ... The development of the machine was severely hampered by the unreliability of the transistors. It consumed 150 watts.The University of Manchester Celebrates the Birth of the Modern Computer  from Computer50.org"]}, {"page": "Manchester computers", "response": ["Work on building a smaller and cheaper computer began in 1952, in parallel with Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, Richard Grimsdale and D. C. Webb, were assigned to the task of designing and building a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power."]}, {"page": "Grimsdale, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Grimsdale"]}]}}
