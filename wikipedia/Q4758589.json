This tree was protected by a fence, and declared sacred by M\u0101ori, who told Colenso that they had brought the tree from the Poor Knights Islands. Colenso made frequent visits to Whangaruru Bay over several years in the vain hope of procuring flowers and fruit. Colenso pointed out the tree to Dr Andrew Sinclair, (1794\u20131861), Colonial Secretary and naturalist, for whom the tree would eventually be named. Colenso and Sinclair sent specimens of the foliage to Kew. Later William Mair found the tree, and he eventually succeeded in procuring specimens of the leaves and fruit, which were forwarded to Dr Joseph Hooker at Kew. From these specimens the original description of the tree was made under the name Botryodendrum sinclairii.Kirk 1869", "* Biography of Andrew Sinclair, from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A.

When Parliament was established, however, many believed that they would soon replace these appointed officials, with ministerial positions being given to members of Parliament instead. The Acting Governor, Robert Wynyard, did not agree, however, saying that the levers of government could not be turned over to Parliament without approval from Britain. The issue was controversial, and ended with the Acting Governor attempting (with only partial success) to suspend the 1st New Zealand Parliament."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (A)", "response": ["* A.Sinclair \u2013 Andrew Sinclair (1796\u20131861)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Gillies", "response": ["He died in his Auckland home, after being \"seized with apoplexy\".

Later that year, Stack describes a trip to the Pink and White Terraces where she was pleased to have ventured to the top of Te Tarata:\"We were very proud of having achieved the rarely accomplished feat and seized the opportunity to gather specimens of mosses and ferns which have never been dry and never felt cold. Some of the mosses were a foot high and we got three varieties of ferns which grew on the brink of the boiling pool, and procured healthy leaves which were dipping in the hot water. Manuka shrubs were thriving in the moist heat, as well as ferns and mosses.\" Te Tarata, p109 In her journal, Stack also describes collecting weta, lizards and stalactites for her 'museum'. In 1859 she says both Dr Sinclair and Captain Haultain (probably Theodore Haultain) offered to help organise her ferns. Stack's journal describes many occasions hunting ferns and mosses for her collection, often with her brother Humphrey and his wife Emma.
