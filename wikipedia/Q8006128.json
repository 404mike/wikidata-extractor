Philip Hobsbaum in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography called this animal tale Rose's main claim to critical attention. It is divided into seven cantos, each prefaced by a personal dedication. The dedications were addressed, in order, to: Ugo Foscolo; John Hookham Frere (called \"our British Berni\"); his Hampshire house Gundimore; Henry Hallam; Bartholomew Frere; Sir Robert Ainslie, 1st Baronet; and Walter Scott.

The types were used for printing the Boydell Shakespeare folio edition."]}, {"page": "George Nicol (bookseller)", "response": ["It is undisputed, however, that Nicol was an enthusiastic participant in the Shakespeare venture. It appears to have been Nicol who recruited William Martin, a typefounder from Birmingham, to cut the type for the new edition, and Martin worked at first from Nicol's home in Pall Mall.Dibdin (1817), Vol II, 383. While Martin was working on the typeface, Nicol and Boydell met the printer William Bulmer by chance, resulting in the agreement to establish Bulmer and Nicol's Shakespeare Press at 3 Russell Court, off Cleveland Row at the western end of Pall Mall. With input from Nicol and Bulmer, Martin created a typeface that so successfully combined utility with beauty that experts took it to be the work of the continental master Giambattista Bodoni. Today, a revived version of this font is known as Bulmer.", "The bibliographer Thomas Frognall Dibdin reports that despite Nicol and Bulmer's satisfaction with the typeface, they were irked by continuing unfavorable comparisons to Bodoni's output. To demonstrate the quality of their new typeface they concocted a \"pretty cheat\" that they called the \"Bodoni Hum\".Dibdin (1817), Vol III, 484, correcting Vol II, 396. Bulmer set and printed Cicero's De Officiis on four large octavo pages in a style mimicking Bodoni's output. Implying that the type was Bodoni's, Nicol showed the sample to various customers, who were so impressed by its beauty that they were anxious to buy copies. Nicol told them \"that Mr. Bodoni had an agent in town; and if they would turn to the bottom of the last page of the specimen, they would find his address\". The customers turned the page to find printed: \"W. Bulmer and Co. Shakspeare Press.\"Wheatley, 165. (Nicol denied Dibdin's initial assertion that the name \"Bodoni Hum\" derived from an exchange between Nicol and George III.) The new typeface helped build the reputation of Bulmer and Nicol's printing office, and the high quality of his output in turn helped build the reputation and popularity of British-produced books in the late-18th century. The association with William Bulmer was continued by Nicol's son William, who ran Bulmer's press from 1819 to 1835. George Nicol's partnership with Bulmer was formally dissolved on 31 December 1819."]}, {"page": "Boydell Shakespeare Gallery", "response": ["The \"magnificent and accurate\" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise\u2014he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project.

The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes.  Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \"Persons in the Drama\".   Boydell spared no expense.  He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition.

His first venture was an edition of Charles Jervas's translation of Don Quixote (1801). Having been successful in this, he published some lesser works of less importance, while he was preparing for the press a new translation, from the French of Antoine Galland, of the Arabian Nights (1802), with twenty-four engravings from pictures by Robert Smirke, R.A. During the same year he brought out an edition of Anacreon, for which William Bulmer furnished a Greek font; the title-plates and vignettes were by Lavinia Forster. Editions of dramatic authors followed, under the titles of British Drama, New British Theatre, and English Drama. An edition of Rasselas, with engravings by Abraham Raimbach from pictures painted by Smirke, was issued by Forster in 1805; it was followed in 1809 by a small privately printed volume of verse, entitled Occasional Amusements, which appeared without his name."]}, {"page": "Bulmer (surname)", "response": ["*William Bulmer (printer) (1757\u20131830), English printer"]}, {"page": "Robert Johnson (artist)", "response": ["Johnson made most of the drawings for Bewick's Fables.
