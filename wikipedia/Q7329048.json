He is one of the earliest well-known wicket-keepers.\nSimmons, who was born and died at Bridge, Kent, was a useful batsman. He probably began playing in the late 1750s and was active until 1779, so the statistical record from 1772 includes only the tail-end of his career. He is recorded in 13 known first-class matches from 1772.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English cricketers to 1771", "response": ["| Richard Simmons"]}, {"page": "Richard Simmons (disambiguation)", "response": ["Richard Simmons may refer to:", "* Richard Simmons (cricketer) (1737\u20131802), English cricketer", "* Richard Simmons (actor) (1913\u20132003), American actor", "* Richard Simmons (born 1948), American fitness personality and actor"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|Richard Simmons"]}]}}
