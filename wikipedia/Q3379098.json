M. Forster", "response": ["Forster was President of the Cambridge Humanists from 1959 until his death and a member of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association from 1963 until his death. His views as a humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections in spite of the restrictions of contemporary society. His humanist attitude is expressed in the 1938 non-fictional essay What I Believe (reprinted with two other humanist essays \u2013 and an introduction and notes by Nicolas Walter \u2013 as What I Believe, and other essays by the secular humanist publishers G. W. Foote & Co. in 1999). When Forster's cousin, Philip Whichelo, donated a portrait of Forster to the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association (GLHA), Jim Herrick, the founder, quoted Forster's words: \"The humanist has four leading characteristics \u2013 curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race.\""]}]}}
