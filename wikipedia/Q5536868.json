He was born in West Bromwich and worked at the local George Salter's Spring Works. Bell was one of the founders of the factory's football team, the West Bromwich Strollers, and played in the team's first recorded match, a 0\u20130 draw against Hudson's soap factory on 23 November 1878. He continued to play for the team following their change of name to West Bromwich Albion in 1879, playing alongside his cousin Harry Bell on several occasions.He scored the winning goal in the 1883 Staffordshire Senior Cup Final to give Albion their first ever trophy. The following season saw Bell play in Albion's first FA Cup match, a 0\u20132 defeat to Wednesbury Town. He appeared in all of Albion's FA Cup games in 1885\u201386 as the club reached the final for the first time. He was on the losing side however, as Albion lost 0\u20132 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay. In 1887, West Bromwich Albion were FA Cup runners-up again, but Bell played in just one match during the cup run, scoring in a 2\u20131 second round victory over Derby Junction. Albion won their first FA Cup in 1888, but Bell did not play in any of the matches, and in June 1888 he joined Kidderminster Harriers, with whom he remained until May 1890.", "link_mentions": {}}}
