She was a skilled spinner and wool worker and made Blackie a tartan plaid. Later she devised a tartan which she called \"The Blackie\". Blackie gave her a beautifully crafted cromag (shepherd\u2019s crook). She also presented Fraser-Mackintosh with a woollen suit. She had done the spinning and dying but not the weaving.D\u00f2mhnall Eachainn Meek,\u201cM\u00e0iri Mh\u00f2r nan \u00d2ran : Taghadh de a h-\u00d2rain\u201d (D\u00f9n  Eideann : Comann Litreachas G\u00e0idhlig na h-Alba, 1998) 19 & 29"]}]}}
