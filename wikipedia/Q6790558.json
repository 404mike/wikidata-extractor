Small Heath\". The Standard (London): p.8. 4 April 1898. Visiting Newton Heath, Small Heath won the toss, and elected to play with the benefit of the wind behind them. They soon opened the scoring, James Higgins reacting to a shot parried by the goalkeeper, but by half time the home team had regained the lead. On change of ends, Newton Heath had much of the play, and eventually increased their lead through a Matthew Gillespie tap-in. The Manchester club's goalkeeper had no shot to save in the second half.\"Newton Heath v. Small Heath\". Manchester Guardian: p.3. 11 April 1898. On a wet pitch at Manchester City's Hyde Road ground, the scoring alternated. Clutterbuck, back in goal after two games out, got a hand to Billy Meredith's shot but failed to stop it, Abbott equalised, then Stockport Smith converted a penalty awarded for handball. Leake scored from distance, then Clutterbuck parried a Meredith shot to Smith's feet. In the second half, the surface became increasingly slippery, the play correspondingly scrappy, and Michael Good tied the scores from a free kick.\"Manchester City v. Small Heath\". Manchester Guardian: p.7. 12 April 1898. Higgins' goal settled the meeting at home to Newcastle United, who had already made sure of their position in the promotion test matches.\"Small Heath v.
