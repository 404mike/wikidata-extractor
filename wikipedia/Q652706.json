He was a professor at the London School of Economics from 1895 to 1926.\nAs a partisan of Jevonianism, Edwin Cannan is perhaps best known for his logical dissection and destruction of Classical theory in his famous 1894 tract A History of the Theories of Production and Distribution. Although Cannan had personal and professional difficulties with Alfred Marshall, he was still   \"Marshall's man\" at the LSE from 1895 to 1926. During that time, particularly during his long stretch as chairman after 1907, Edwin Cannan shepherded the LSE away from its roots in Fabian socialism into tentative Marshallianism. This period was only to last, however, until his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Lionel Robbins, took over with his more \"Continental\" ideas.\nThough Cannan, in his early years as an economist, was a critic of classical economics and an ally of interventionists, he moved sharply to the side of classical liberalism in the early 20th century.  He favored a simplicity, clarity, and common sense in the exposition of economics.  According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson, Cannan \"emphasised the institutional foundation of economic systems\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London School of Economics", "response": ["The 1930s economic debate between LSE and Cambridge is well known in academic circles. Rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's Edwin Cannan (1861\u20131935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, Alfred Marshall (1842\u20131924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)Dahrendorf (1995), p.210-213", "The school's arms, including its motto and beaver mascot, were adopted in February 1922, on the recommendation of a committee of twelve, including eight students, which was established to research the matter.

He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909).  The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937.
