Ganpat is another name for the elephant god Ganesh. He started his writing career with articles for 'Blackwood's Magazine' on his service in East Africa during World War 1. He wrote many adventure stories in the style of H. Rider Haggard, though most of Ganpat's stories are set in the Himalayas. He was an Anglo Indian soldier, and his stories reflect his military and frontier background. He retired in 1939 with the rank of Brigadier, ending his days in the town of Chagford, on the edge of Dartmoor, where he could pursue his passion for fishing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gomperz", "response": ["*Louis Gompertz (1886\u20131951), Anglo-Indian soldier and writer "]}, {"page": "Lost world", "response": ["*Harilek: A Romance of Modern Central Asia by Ganpat (Louis Gompertz)"]}, {"page": "Martin Louis Alan Gompertz", "response": ["#REDIRECT Louis Gompertz"]}]}}
