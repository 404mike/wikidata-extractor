He was a close friend and correspondent of poet John Keats, whose letters to Reynolds constitute a significant body of Keats' poetic thought. Reynolds was also the brother-in-law of the writer and humorist Thomas Hood, who was married to his sister Jane.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Keats", "response": ["Despite the bad reviews of Poems, Hunt published the essay \"Three Young Poets\" (Shelley, Keats, and Reynolds) and the sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer,\" foreseeing great things to come.Gittings (1968), p. 155. He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of The Times, Thomas Barnes; the writer Charles Lamb; the conductor Vincent Novello; and the poet John Hamilton Reynolds, who would become a close friend.Motion (1997), pp. 116\u2013120. Keats also met regularly with William Hazlitt, a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed \"a new school of poetry\".Motion (1997) p. 130. At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey, \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth.\"Keats's letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817 This passage would eventually appear in the concluding lines of \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": Beauty is truth, truth beauty' \u2013 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training, and despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, made large loans to friends such as the painter Benjamin Haydon. He would go on to lend \u00a3700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.Bate (1964) p. 632."]}, {"page": "Leigh Hunt", "response": ["Both Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley belonged to a literary group that gathered around Hunt at Hampstead.

A temperate sharpness about it [...] I never lik'd stubble fields so much as now [...] Somehow a stubble plain looks warm \u2013 in the same way that some pictures look warm \u2013 this struck me so much in my sunday's walk that I composed upon it.\"Keats 2008 p. 184 Not everything on Keats's mind at the time was bright; the poet knew in September that he would have to finally abandon Hyperion. Thus, in the letter that he wrote to Reynolds, Keats also included a note saying that he abandoned his long poem.Bate 1963 p. 585 Keats did not send \"To Autumn\" to Reynolds, but did include the poem within a letter to Richard Woodhouse, his publisher and friend, and dated it on the same day.Evert 1965 pp. 296\u2013297"]}, {"page": "Mansion of Many Apartments", "response": ["The Mansion of Many Apartments is a metaphor that the poet John Keats expressed in a letter to John Hamilton Reynolds dated Sunday, 3 May 1818."]}, {"page": "Thomas Hood", "response": ["In 1821, John Scott, editor of The London Magazine, was killed in a duel, and the periodical passed into the hands of some friends of Hood, who proposed to make him sub-editor.
