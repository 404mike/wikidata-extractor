His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points.Goddard, pp. 298\u2013301 In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures. The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Sa\u00ebns, alongside use of jazz-like themes.Orenstein (1991), pp. 204\u2013205 The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, \"one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented\", the composer \"can truly be said to join hands with Mozart\".Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 610 The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, Bol\u00e9ro (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating \"a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm\".Nichols (2011), p. 302"]}, {"page": "Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns", "response": ["The authors of the 1955 The Record Guide, Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Sa\u00ebns's brilliant musicianship was \"instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that there are other forms of music besides opera.\"Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 641 In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary, Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Sa\u00ebns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia. Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable. The \"Urbs Roma\" Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and \"thick and heavy\" in its effect. Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing. The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ. It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune. The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Sa\u00ebns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation."]}, {"page": "Hector Berlioz", "response": ["Harold in Italy, despite its subtitle \"Symphony in four parts with viola principal\", is described by the musicologist Mark Evan Bonds as a work traditionally seen as lacking any direct historical antecedent, \"a hybrid of symphony and concerto that owes little or nothing to the earlier, lighter genre of the symphonie concertante\".Bonds, p. 417 In the 20th century critical opinion varied about the work, even among those well-disposed to Berlioz. Felix Weingartner, an early 20th century champion of the composer, wrote in 1904 that it did not reach the level of the Symphonie fantastique;Weingartner, p. 67 fifty years later Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor found it \"romantic and picturesque\u00a0...

They commented that the composer's vision is expressed in two main contrasting moods: \"the one contemplative and trance-like, the other pugnacious and sinister\". The first mood, generally predominant in the composer's output, was more popular, as audiences preferred \"the stained-glass beauty of the Tallis Fantasia, the direct melodic appeal of the Serenade to Music, the pastoral poetry of The Lark Ascending, and the grave serenity of the Fifth Symphony\". By contrast, as in the ferocity of the Fourth and Sixth Symphonies and the Concerto for Two Pianos: \"in his grimmer moods Vaughan Williams can be as frightening as Sibelius and Bart\u00f3k\".Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 786"]}, {"page": "William Walton", "response": ["Walton's first successful large-scale concert work, the Viola Concerto (1929) is in marked contrast to the raucous Portsmouth Point; despite the common influence of jazz and of the music of Hindemith and Ravel, in its structure and romantic longing it owes much to the Elgar Cello Concerto. In this work, wrote Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor in The Record Guide, \"the lyric poet in Walton, who had so far been hidden under a mask of irony, fully emerged.\"Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 848 Walton followed this pattern in his two subsequent concertos, for Violin (1937) and for Cello (1956). Each opens reflectively, is in three movements, and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections. The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos, with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time."]}, {"page": "Hugo Wolf", "response": ["* Volume I, entirely performed by Elena Gerhardt accompanied by Coenraad V.

In the 1930s Sir Thomas Beecham told the critic Neville Cardus, \"I would give the whole of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos for Massenet's Manon, and would think I had vastly profited by the exchange.\"Cardus, p. 29 By the 1950s critics were reappraising Massenet's works. In 1951 Martin Cooper of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Massenet's detractors, including some fellow composers, were on the whole idealistic, even puritanical, \"but few of them have in practice achieved anything so near perfection in any genre, however humble, as Massenet achieved in his best works.\"Cooper, French Music (1951), quoted in Hughes and van Thal, p. 250 In 1955 Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor commented in The Record Guide that, although usually dismissed as an inferior Gounod, Massenet wrote music with a distinct flavour of its own. \"He had a gift for melody of a suave, voluptuous and eminently singable kind, and the intelligence and dramatic sense to make the most of it.\" The writers called for revivals of Gris\u00e9lidis, Le jongleur de Notre-Dame, Don Quichotte and Cendrillon, all then neglected.Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 433 By the 1990s, Massenet's reputation had been considerably rehabilitated. In The Penguin Opera Guide (1993), Hugh Macdonald wrote that though Massenet's operas never equalled the grandeur of Berlioz's Les Troyens, the genius of Bizet's Carmen or the profundity of Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, from the 1860s until the years before the First World War, the composer gave the French lyric stage a remarkable series of works, two of which \u2013 Manon and Werther \u2013 are \"masterpieces that will always grace the repertoire\". In Macdonald's view, Massenet \"embodies many enduring aspects of the belle \u00e9poque, one of the richest cultural periods in history\".Macdonald, pp. 216\u2013217 In France, Massenet's 20th-century eclipse was less complete than elsewhere, but his oeuvre has been revalued in recent years. In 2003 Piotr Kaminsky wrote in Mille et un op\u00e9ras of Massenet's skill in translating French text into flexible melodic phrases, his exceptional orchestral virtuosity, combining sparkle and clarity, and his unerring theatrical instinct.Kaminsky, p. 864 Begun by Jean-Louis Pichon in November 1990, the Massenet Festival in Massenet's native Saint-\u00c9tienne have produced biennial performances to promote and celebrate his music."]}, {"page": "The Curlew", "response": ["* Ren\u00e9 Soames (tenor), Geoffrey Gilbert (flute), L\u00e9on Goossens (English horn), Aeolian String Quartet (Cave, Williams, Forbes, Moore) (HMV 3x12\" 78rpm discs C 7934-36) (27 March and 12 April 1950).E.
