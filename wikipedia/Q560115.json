As well as paintings and drawings, he produced designs for stained glass, furniture, ceramics, table glassware, buildings and interiors, was a lithographer and woodcutter and was a book illustrator. It has been estimated that during his lifetime Brangwyn produced over 12,000 works. His mural commissions would cover over 22,000 sq ft (2,000 m2) of canvas, he painted over 1,000 oils, over 660 mixed media works (watercolours, gouache), over 500 etchings, about 400 wood-engravings and woodcuts, 280 lithographs, 40 architectural and interior designs, 230 designs for items of furniture and 20 stained glass panels and windows. \nBrangwyn received some artistic training, probably from his father, and later from Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo and in the workshops of William Morris, but he was largely an autodidact without a formal artistic education. When, at the age of seventeen, one of his paintings was accepted at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, he was strengthened in his conviction to become an artist. Initially, he painted traditional subjects about the sea and life on the seas. His 1890 canvas, Funeral At Sea won a medal of the third class at the 1891 Paris Salon. The murals for which Brangwyn was famous, and during his lifetime he was very famous indeed, were brightly coloured and crowded with details of plants and animals, although they became flatter and less flamboyant later in his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Josh Kirby", "response": ["When asked about influences, he most often named three past artists.

An Act of Parliament in 1854 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists, and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881.Royal Cambrian Academy  The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made many works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists, based respectively in the United States and France. Sir Frank Brangwyn was Welsh by origin, but spent little time in Wales."]}, {"page": "Austin Osman Spare", "response": ["Spare's major patron during this period was the wealthy property developer Pickford Waller, although other admirers included Desmond Coke, Ralph Strauss, Lord Howard de Walden and Charles Ricketts. Spare became popular among avant-garde homosexual circles in Edwardian London, with several known gay men becoming patrons of his work.Baker 2011. p. 56. In particular he became good friends with the same-sex couple Marc-Andr\u00e9 Raffalovich and John Gray, with Spare later characterising the latter as \"the most wonderful man I have ever met.\"Baker 2011. pp. 53\u201355. Gray would introduce Spare to the Irish novelist George Moore, whom he would subsequently befriend.Baker 2011. p. 62. The actual nature of Spare's sexuality at the time remains debated; his friend Frank Brangwyn would later claim that he was \"strongly\" homosexual but had suppressed these leanings.Baker 2011. p.\u00a057. In contrast to this, in later life Spare would refer to a wide variety of heterosexual encounters that took place at this time, including with an intersex person, a dwarf with a protuberant forehead and a Welsh maid.Baker 2011. pp. 63\u201364. He would unsuccessfully also attempt to woo both Sybil Waller, the daughter of Pickford Waller, as well as a younger girl named Constance \"Connie\" Smith.Baker 2011. pp. 78\u201379.", "In July 1914, Spare held another exhibition of his work, this time at the Baillie Gallery in Bruton St, London.Baker 2011. p. 111. This was his first one-man exhibition. At the same time, he was involved in a newly launched popular art magazine known as Colour, which was edited in Victoria Street, submitting a number of contributions to its early issues. He soon developed the idea of founding his own art magazine, suggesting the idea to the publisher John Lane, who had formerly produced The Yellow Book, an influential periodical that had appeared between 1894 to 1897. Envisioning his new venture, titled Form, as a successor to The Yellow Book, he was joined as co-editor by the etcher Frederick Carter, who used the pseudonym of Francis Marsden.Baker 2011. pp. 111\u2013112. The first issue appeared in the summer of 1916, containing contributions from Edmund Joseph Sullivan, Walter de la Mare, Frank Brangwyn, W.H. Davies, J.C. Squire, Ricketts and Shannon. Spare and Carter co-wrote an article discussing automatic writing, arguing that it allowed the unconscious part of the mind to produce art, a theme that Spare had previously dealt with in The Book of Pleasure.Baker 2011. pp. 112\u2013113. Generally, Form was poorly received by the critics and the public, being described as a \"very horrible publication\" by George Bernard Shaw, who proclaimed its design and layout to be \"ancient Morrisian\" and thereby out of fashion.Baker 2011. pp. 116\u2013117. Although initially designed to be a quarterly, the second edition of Form only emerged in April 1917, and soon after, Carter would resign due to arguments with Spare.Baker 2011. pp. 121.", "Spare was demobilized in 1919. Following the victory of Britain and its allies, Spare had moved into a small flat at 8 Gilbert Place in Bloomsbury, Central London, where he lived alone; although they never gained a divorce, Spare had separated from his wife Eily, who had begun a relationship with another man.Baker 2011. p. 123. Focusing on the writing and illustration of a new book, 1921 saw the publication of The Focus of Life The Mutterings of AOS by Morland Press. Edited and introduced by Frederick Carter, the book once more dealt with Spare's mystical ideas, continuing many of the themes explored in The Book of Pleasure.Baker 2011. pp. 129\u2013133.Reissued with additional material including poems by Aleister Crowley as And Now For Reality. Oxon: Mandrake Press, 1990 The success of this book led Spare to decide to revive Form, with the first issue appearing in a new format in October 1921, edited by Spare and his friend W.H. Davies. Intended to be populist in tone, contributions came from Sidney Sime, Robert Graves, Herbert Furst, Laura Knight, Frank Brangwyn, Glyn Philpot, Edith Sitwell, Walter de la Mare, J.F.C. Fuller and Havelock Ellis. However, Spare discontinued the magazine after the third issue, which was published in January 1922.Baker 2011. pp. 136\u2013137. He then moved on the production of another art journal, The Golden Hind, co-edited with Clifford Bax and published by Chapman and Hall. The first issue appeared in October 1922, featuring a lithograph from Spare titled \"The New Eden.\" Faced with problems, the journal eventually decreasing in size from a folio to a quarto, and in 1924 it folded after eight issues.Baker 2011. pp. 137\u2013141."]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Frank Brangwyn (1867\u20131956) born in Bruges"]}, {"page": "1890 in art", "response": ["* Frank Brangwyn \u2013 Funeral at Sea"]}, {"page": "1956 in art", "response": ["*June 11 - Frank Brangwyn, Welsh painter (b. 1867)"]}, {"page": "Granville Bantock", "response": ["*Macbeth (1926, Shakespeare, Sybil Thorndike's Prince Theatre, London production with Thorndike, Henry Ainley, Lewis Casson, and design by Frank Brangwyn, 1926, music later incorporated in Macbeth Overture)"]}, {"page": "American Renaissance", "response": ["*Cuyahoga County Courthouse (1906\u20131912): the exterior includes sculpture by Karl Bitter, Daniel Chester French, Herbert Adams, Isidore Konti and Herman Matzen, while the interior contains murals by Frank Brangwyn, Violet Oakley, Charles Yardley Turner, Max Bohm and Frederick Wilson.
