A 'gloom' descended, multiplied by matters such as debt and the death of ex-player John Nicholson. The season tailed off, especially with new signing, former Wales international Mel Charles failing to impress. Just before the season ended, John Ritchie was sold to Preston North End for \u00a317,500, to help pay off an \u00a380,000 overdraft. On 8 May, Mudie resigned as player-manager due to 'personal reasons'. The club finished in mid-table with a financial loss, despite making a profit in the transfer market. It was noted that 'the weekly income is insufficient to maintain the club. On a more positive note, Roy Sproson was awarded the first 'player of the year' award by the club.", "Numerous players were let go before the 1967\u201368 campaign began; a young Ray Kennedy's departure would be bitterly regretted over the next two decades. The club also 'reluctantly' accepted a \u00a325,000 Blackpool bid for Terry Alcock. Two new signings were Roy Chapman and Mick Morris, both free transfers. The club took a pre-season tour of Czechoslovakia. In November the FA launched an investigation into alleged breaches of rules on payments to players by the club. By January the investigation became a commission, looking charges of weekly wages for 'amateurs', playing schoolboys, extra bonuses for victories, and an illegal signing on bonus and other bonuses paid to John Ritchie, as well as bonuses to Clint Boulton and Gordon Logan, as well as gifts to young players that broke FA rules. In February the club admitted to the charges and were fined \u00a32,000, later doubled, and told that irrespective of where they finished in the table, they would be made to apply for re-election to the Football League at the end of the season. On 8 June they were readmitted to the league by 39 votes to 9. Stanley Matthews 'gradually drifted out of the picture' and Gordon Lee was appointed as manager. It was later revealed that Matthew's left being owed money by the club, which they never paid him, a key reason as to why he never managed in England again.In 1968\u201369, Lee won respect for his 'honesty and enthusiasm' as the club consolidated their league status. Bill Asprey retired to go into coaching in a quiet season for the club. Football hooliganism started to take its grip on the game, and Vale's early experience of it consisted of witnessing the Chester City team coach smashed with bricks. At the end of the season the club were in debt to the tune of \u00a3178,277, with a \u00a310,900 loss being made on the season. Already strict economies were tightened by the club hierarchy."]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["As Vale slipped down the table, they were denied permission by the Ministry of Labour to sign USA international Willy Roy as he did not meet the two-year residential requirement. More trouble came when Bo'ness United reported the club to the Scottish Junior Football Association for an alleged breach of the rules in the transfer of Roddy Georgeson. On the pitch results continued to go against the Vale, as they found themselves in a re-election struggle by January. Vale then went on a club-record six consecutive away games without scoring a goal in a run lasting from 8 January to 9 March. In came left-back John Ritchie from Whitley Bay, though free agent Graham Barnett did not return to the club, despite protestations from supporters \u2013 the management stated that Barnett's wage demands were too great. For the clash with bottom-placed Bradford City on 12 January, Vale assembled the youngest ever Football League forward line: Alex Donald (17), Roddy Georgeson (17), Mick Cullerton (17), Paul Bannister (18), and Paul Ogden (19). Of the five forwards only Bannister had played competitively before. Bradford won 2\u20130. A 2\u20131 win over Rochdale was then followed by four straight defeats.

A win over Barrow and a draw at Stockport County were succeeded by five straight defeats, killing Vale's promotion hopes dead. They reversed the decline by doing the double over Rochdale within two days, including a 5\u20130 victory witnessed by 3,004 fans at Vale Park. In April, popular player John Ritchie was sold to Preston North End for \u00a317,500.

With this hanging over the club's head form suffered, and Jimmy Hill left the club to become player-manager of Derry City. Stan Steele returned from South Africa and joined on a month-long trial, however he only managed to score an 'incredible' own goal by lobbing Stuart Sharratt in a 3\u20130 loss to Aldershot. On 20 February the FA-Football League joint-inquiry 'severely censured' Port Vale officials at Lancaster Gate after the officials admitted the charges held against them. The club received a \u00a32,000 fine and a recommendation that they be expelled from the league, a month later on 6 Mach another \u00a32,000 fine was issued and the club were informed that they would be expelled from the Football League at the end of the season. The club's officials were 'shocked and appalled' at the 'savage penalties', and Stoke City chairman Albert Henshall also called the punishment 'severe'. The club changed the leadership structure and defiantly stated their aim to win promotion from the Fourth Division, and also their decision to appoint a new player-manager to lead them to such an aim.
