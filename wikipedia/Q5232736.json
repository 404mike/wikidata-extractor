(2007). In essence it is a measure of reproductive success due to how well the phenology of the prey is able to meet the requirements of its predator. In ecological studies, a few examples include; the seasonal occurrence of breeding bird species to that of their primary prey (Visser et al. 1998, Strode 2003), the interactions between herring fish reproduction and copepod spawning (Cushing 1990), or the relationship between winter moth egg hatching, and the timing of oak bud bursting (Visser & Holleman 2001)."]}, {"page": "Cushing (surname)", "response": ["* David Cushing (1920\u20132008), British fisheries biologist"]}]}}
