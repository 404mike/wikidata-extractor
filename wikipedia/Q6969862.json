In 1801 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Cavan.\nOn 29 July 1833, in Westmoreland Street, Dublin, Nathaniel Sneyd was shot in the head by a madman, John Mason, who had a grudge against the firm of wine merchants Sneyd, French and Barton, where Sneyd was senior partner. Sneyd died of his wounds two days later. He had two memorials, one in Cavan and a life-size neo-classical recumbent effigy in the crypt of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. The sculptor Thomas Kirk represented Sneyd lying dead with a female figure weeping over him.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
