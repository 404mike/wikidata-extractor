He won fourteen caps for Wales and also played for invitational club the Barbarians. Meredith was a powerful prop, and was much praised by second row players for his tight packing, which allowed them the opportunity to shove the opposition. He played both tight and loose head prop but preferred tight head.\nOn the 1955 British and Irish Lions Tour the all-Welsh front row of Billy Williams, Bryn Meredith and Courtney Meredith was selected for a Lions test match. This did not occur again until June 2009 when Gethin Jenkins, Adam Jones and Matthew Rees were selected as the British and Irish Lions front row for the 2nd Test against South Africa.Courtney Meredith is now the only survivor from Wales\u2019 last triumph over New Zealand, the 13-8 victory at Cardiff Arms Park on 19 December 1953. \nInternational matches played\nWales\n England 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957\n France 1954, 1955\n Ireland 1954, 1955, 1956\n New Zealand 1953\n Scotland 1953,1954, 1955, 1957", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neath RFC", "response": ["*  Courtney Meredith"]}, {"page": "Gethin Jenkins", "response": ["In June 2009 Jenkins, Adam Jones and Matthew Rees were selected as the British & Irish Lions front row for the second Test against South Africa.
