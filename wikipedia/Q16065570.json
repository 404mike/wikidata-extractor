His bardic name was derived from the Stag Inn, the public house that he ran at Trecynon, Aberdare.\n\nWilliams was born on 6 March 1808 near Aberpergwm in the Vale of Neath, the son of Noah and Joan Williams, who attended the Unitarian chapel at Blaengwrach.  At a young age he moved to Tredegar, and later to Llwydcoed, Aberdare, where, in 1832, he married, raised a family, and spent the rest of his life running the Stag Inn.He first became politically active during the time of the Chartists and contributed to their Welsh journal, Udgorn Cymru. At this time, he was also a member of a society known as the 'Free Enquirers' at Aberdare.In 1841, Williams held the first of many eisteddfodau at the Stag, and a friendly society known as the 'Cymreigyddion of the Carw Coch' was established. Amongst those associated with this movement was David Williams (Alaw Goch), the Rev. Thomas Price of Calfaria, Aberdare and many other local poets and writers.  The Carw Coch eisteddfod continued for many years and many of the compositions published in a volume known as Gardd Aberd\u00e2r (1853 onwards).Williams was a staunch Unitarian, a leading member of Hen Dy Cwrdd at Trecynon and a contributor to their journal, Yr Ymofynydd.  He was also one of the founders of the newspaper Y Gwladgarwr ( 1857\u201383) and wrote a regular column for the paper until his death.\nDuring the 1868 General Election he played a peripheral role in the campaign of Henry Richard and sought assurances at a meeting held at Ebenezer, Trecynon that Richard supported the reform of the House of Lords.Williams died on 26 September 1872, and was buried at St Fagan's, Aberdare. His son, Lewis Noah Williams (Ap Carw Coch) became a leading public figure and a member of the Aberdare Urban District Council.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberdare", "response": ["Aberdare, during its boom years, was considered a centre of Welsh culture: it hosted the first National Eisteddfod in 1861, with which David Williams (Alaw Goch) was closely associated. A number of local eisteddfodau had long been held in the locality, associated with figures such as William Williams (Carw Coch) The Eisteddfod was again held in Aberdare in 1885, and also in 1956 at Aberdare Park where the Gorsedd standing stones still exist. At the last National Eisteddfod held in Aberdare in 1956 Mathonwy Hughes won the chair. From the mid nineteenth century, Aberdare was an important publishing centre where a large number of books and journals were produced, the majority of which were in the Welsh language. A newspaper entitled Y Gwladgarwr (the Patriot) was published at Aberdare from 1856 until 1882 and was circulated widely throughout the South Wales valleys.  From 1875 a more successful newspaper, Tarian y Gweithiwr (the Workman's Shield) was published at Aberdare by John Mills. Y Darian, as it was known, strongly supported the trade union movements among the miners and ironworkers of the valleys. The miners' leader, William Abraham, derived support from the newspaper, which was also aligned with radical nonconformist liberalism. The rise of the political labour movement and the subsequent decline of the Welsh language in the valleys, ultimately led to its decline and closure in 1934."]}, {"page": "William Williams", "response": ["William Williams may refer to:", "* William Williams (artist) (1727\u20131791), artist and author of American novel Penrose", "* William Williams (antiquary) (Gwilym Ddu o Arfon, 1739\u20131817), Welsh historian and poet", "* William Williams (Carw Coch) (1808\u20131872, bardic name Carw Coch), Welsh literary figure", "* William Williams (Creuddynfab) (1814\u20131869), Welsh poet and literary critic", "* William Williams (Crwys) (1875\u20131968, bardic name Crwys), Welsh-language poet", "* William Williams (soldier) (died 1814), soldier killed in defense of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812", "* William Williams (Medal of Honor) (1840\u20131893), Medal of Honor recipient of the American Civil War", "* William Williams (VC) (1890\u20131965), Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War", "* William Williams (Connecticut politician) (1731\u20131811), US Continental Congressman", "* William Williams (New York politician) (1815\u20131876), US Representative from New York", "* William Williams (Indiana politician) (1821\u20131896), US Representative from Indiana", "* William Williams (surgeon) (1856\u20131919), Surgeon General", "* William Williams (commissioner) (1862\u20131947), Commissioner of Immigration, Ellis Island", "* Sir William Williams, 6th Baronet (died 1696), Welsh politician", "* Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Gray's Inn (1634\u20131700), Welsh lawyer and politician, speaker of the House of Commons", "* Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet, of Gray's Inn (1665\u20131740), Welsh politician, Member of Parliament (MP) for Denbigh, 1708\u20131710", "* Sir William Williams, 2nd Baronet, of Clapton (1730\u20131761), MP for New Shoreham, 1758\u20131751", "* William Williams (Radical politician) (1788\u20131865), Welsh businessman based in London, Radical MP 1835\u20131847 and 1850\u20131865", "* William Williams (Swansea MP) (1840\u20131904), British Member of Parliament for Swansea District 1893\u20131895", "* William Williams (Labour politician) (1895\u20131963), British civil servant and politician", "* William Williams (New South Wales politician) (1856\u20131947), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "* William Williams (Tasmanian politician) (1851\u20131924), member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council", "* William Williams (Archdeacon of Cashel) (fl. 17th century), Irish Anglican clergyman", "* William Williams of Wern (1781\u20131840), Welsh Independent minister, promoter of the General Union movement of 1834", "* William Williams (bishop) (1800\u20131878), bishop of Waiapu in New Zealand", "* William Williams (Caledfryn) (1801\u20131869), Welsh Congregational minister, poet and literary critic", "* William Williams (priest) (1848\u20131930), Dean of St David's, 1919\u20131931", "* William Williams (minister) (1848\u20131913), Australian Methodist minister and president-general of the Methodist Church of Australasia 1907\u20131910", "* William Williams (missionary) (1859\u20131892), Welsh missionary to East Khasi Hills, India", "* William Williams (footballer) (1856\u2013?), Welsh international footballer in the 1870s and 1880s", "* William Williams (footballer, born 1892) (1892\u20131926), English footballer", "* William Williams (rugby union) (1866\u20131945), Welsh rugby union footballer in the 1880s and 1890s", "* William Williams (Halifax RLFC) (20th century), Welsh rugby league footballer in the 1900s and 1910s", "* J.
