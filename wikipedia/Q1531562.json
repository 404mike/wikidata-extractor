Ballad operas generally quoted well known tunes, and in this case the tune is certainly much older. A fine and elaborate setting of an older tune with this name \"For Old Lang Syne, by Mr. Beck\", with variation appears in the Balcarres Lute Book, from Scotland. Here attributions such as \"By Mr. Beck\" are generally used to indicate the composer of the setting, not the underlying tune. This book was compiled around 1700, it has remained in the possession of the same family since its compilation, and it is now held by the National Library of Scotland.,.Tune 106 \"For Old Lang Syne, by Mr. Beck\", recorded by Rob MacKillop. https://scottishlute.com/balcarres/The Balcarres Lute Book, facsimile edition, ed. Matthew Spring, Universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen, 2010.  https://boydellandbrewer.com/the-balcarres-lute-book-2-volume-set-pb.html As variation sets are generally composed on recognisable tunes, this  is very probably older still. A later appearance of this old tune,  was published by William McGibbon, who died in 1756. While both of these settings are on the earlier tune, the opening bars are immediately recognisable.  Probably the first printed appearances of the modern tune are first, Shield's use of it in Rosina. In the final allegro, what is essentially the modern form of the tune appears on the oboe; as this section contains Scotch snap rhythms, with a drone accompaniment on bassoon 'in imitation of bagpipes', it may well be that the use of this melody by Shield is also a quotation. Shield does not claim it as his own, as he does  with some of the song tunes in the opera. Rosina premiered at the end of 1782. In 1784, Niel Gow  published it, as Sir Alexander Don's Strathpey, in his Collection of Strathspey Reels.http://imslp.org/wiki/A_Collection_of_Strathspey_Reels%2C_etc._(Gow%2C_Niel), p.12 Like Shield, Gow does not claim to have composed it; it is closely related to older strathspeys such as Coming Through the Rye, and The Miller's Wedding."]}, {"page": "Henry Raeburn", "response": ["*Niel Gow"]}, {"page": "1807 in music", "response": ["*March 1 \u2013 Niel Gow, fiddler (b. 1727)  "]}, {"page": "Pochette (musical instrument)", "response": ["* Niel Gow is known to have played a pochette, and reportedly carried one in his pocket whenever he walked from his house in Inver to Blair Castle, where he worked."]}, {"page": "Music of Scotland", "response": ["In the 18th century, Scottish fiddling is said to have reached new heights.

In the early 19th century, the orchestra was from Edinburgh, and conducted by Nathaniel Gow, son of the celebrated Niel Gow; later on, in the early Victorian era, Weippert and Collinet's band provided the music. To avoid any suggestion of impropriety, dances were initially limited to English country dances and Scotch reels. This changed some time after the declaration of the Regency, when first the quadrille and then the waltz, at that time more like the modern polka, were introduced. According to Raikes, these were first danced at Almack's in 1813, to Gronow in 1815, and to Dancing in the Badminton Library, 1816. The introduction of the quadrille is strongly associated with Lady Jersey, and the waltz definitely linked to Countess de Lieven. As late as 1823, this could still lead to offence: \"I went two nights ago to a costume ball at Almack's for a Welsh charity. It was very brilliant & there was a quadrille that was beautiful\u2026The quadrille, however, gave great offence, for they danced together all night & took the upper end of the room, which was considered a great impertinence.\" By 1837, matters had so far changed that the gallopade and the waltz were now the only things danced at the Almack's balls."]}, {"page": "Nathaniel Gow", "response": ["Nathaniel Gow (1763\u20131831) was the fourth son of Niel Gow, and a celebrated performer, composer and arranger of tunes, songs and other pieces on his own right.
