Fawcett studied music under his father. He was organist of St John the Evangelist's Church, Farnworth from 1825 till 1842, and afterwards (until his death) of Bolton parish church, a post which had previously been held by an elder brother, and which was taken by a sister for a year in the interval of Fawcett's visit to London. Here he entered the Royal Academy of Music on 5 December 1845, to study under Sterndale Bennett, and became organist at Earl Howe's Curzon Street church.\nOn his return to Bolton, Fawcett resumed his duties as organist, teacher, and (1849) honorary conductor of the Bolton Harmonic Society. He obtained the degree of Mus. Bac. at Oxford University on 3 November 1852.
