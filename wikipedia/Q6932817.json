The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries in the Landscape but his publisher, Batsford, had insisted on the shorter title.", "Alongside his academic publications, Aston wrote two books on archaeology for a more general audience, both of which were published by Channel 4 Books as a spin-off from the Time Team television series. The first of these was Time Team's Timechester: A Companion to Archaeology, co-written with Carenza Lewis and Phil Harding and first published in 2000. Based around the fictional British town of Timechester, the book looks at how the settlement would have progressed from the Palaeolithic through to the modern day, and examines the remains that each period would have left behind in the archaeological record. This was followed in 2002 by Archaeology is Rubbish: A Beginner's Guide, which Aston co-wrote with Tony Robinson and dedicated to Harding. Archaeology is Rubbish describes a fictional excavation site in an ordinary suburban back garden, and discusses the evidence from different archaeological periods, the field methods and techniques used by the excavators, and the legal proceedings and problems that archaeologists in Britain face.", "| , Phil Harding, and Tim Taylor", "Following Aston's death, former colleague Francis Pryor noted that Aston was a \"remarkable archaeologist who could really dig\", being a \"warm, loving, nice man.\" Another colleague, Phil Harding, commented on Aston's \"incredible knowledge\" and \"effortless way of making archaeology accessible to people.\" Tony Robinson wrote of him: \"Mick was a real child of the '60s and a bit of a rebel, but he was also a series of contradictions. He was one of the best academic archaeologists in the country, yet his real love was teaching ordinary people. He was the grumpiest old Black Country curmudgeon you could imagine, but he had a heart of absolute gold.\"Tony Robinson, \"Mick Aston: 1946-2013\", Radio Times, 6\u201312 July 2013, p.143 He also noted that \"archaeology is now a subject that tens of thousands of people enjoy and value, and this is almost solely down to him.\" Ralph Lee, head of Channel 4's factual programming, described Aston as a \"brilliant communicator\" who helped make archaeology \"so popular\" in the UK."]}, {"page": "Marlborough, Wiltshire", "response": ["*Phil Harding, Time Team archaeologist, educated in the town"]}, {"page": "Mildenhall, Wiltshire", "response": ["*Phil Harding (b. 1950), archaeologist, educated in Marlborough, worked at the Roman town in Mildenhall in 2009"]}, {"page": "Wessex Archaeology", "response": ["Phil Harding, who appeared on the archaeological television programme Time Team, works for Wessex Archaeology."]}, {"page": "Farndon, Nottinghamshire", "response": ["Describing the finds at Farndon, as \"the dream scenario\" archaeologist Phil Harding, who is also an expert in shaping stone tools, said \"As a flint knapper, you were there with them\".
