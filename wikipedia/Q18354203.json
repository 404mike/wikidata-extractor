She modelled for Augustus John and Jacob Epstein and came to exemplify the sexual freedom of the bohemian lifestyle of the early twentieth century. Henry Lamb called her Euphemia, by which name she was generally known. John Maynard Keynes commented that Euphemia had more of a sex life \"than the rest of us put together\". She was one of the lovers of the occultist Aleister Crowley.", "link_mentions": {}}}
