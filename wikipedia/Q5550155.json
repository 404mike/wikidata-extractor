Eight legal officers and one senior legal officer are required to deal with the commission's normal case load. In order to review the case of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the commission sought approval from the Scottish Executive Justice Department for the appointment of two additional legal officers and one senior legal officer.", "As at 31 March 2007 the SCCRC had received a total of 887 cases since April 1999, when it was established. The Commission completed its review of 841 of these cases and referred 67 of them to the High Court. Of the referrals, 39 have been determined: 25 appeals were granted; 11 appeals rejected; and, 3 abandoned. Chief Executive, Gerard Sinclair, says that normally the court rules about half the referrals to be a miscarriage of justice each year, which would equate in 2003 to roughly 0.005% of the total number of Scottish criminal convictions. But, says Sinclair: \"Even if it were just one wrongful conviction a year, that would still be one too many.\""]}, {"page": "Sinclair (surname)", "response": ["*Gerard Sinclair, solicitor"]}]}}
