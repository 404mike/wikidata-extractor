He referenced  classical opera singer Elizabeth Billington, a well-acclaimed soprano with a strong voice who could only reach a small audience and naturally did not have access to a microphone or amplifier in 1798, let alone \"MTV, CDs, iTunes, and Pandora\". This limited her ability to dominate the market in the way that artists to do today. Marshall wrote, \"So long as the number of persons who can be reached by a human voice is strictly limited, it is not very likely that any singer will make an advance on the \u00a310,000 said to have been earned in a season by Mrs. Billington at the beginning of the last century, nearly as great [an increase] as that which the business leaders of the present generation have made on those of the last.\" Furthermore, the trends in popular music indicate that the price of the average concert ticket increased by nearly 400% from 1981 to 2012, much faster than the 150% rise in overall consumer price inflation."]}, {"page": "John Bell (publisher)", "response": ["*Volume 13.

There she met Lorenzo Da Ponte, who later reported she had been vulgar, impudent, dissolute and even a drunkard. Specifically, he said that she was \"ignorant, foolish and insolent\", and that she \"took to theatre, where only her voice had led her, all habitudes, manners and morals of an impudent Corisca\". He also credited her with a sexual relationship with William Taylor, manager of the King's Theatre.Da Ponte, L., Memorie , digital edition. Quote: la Banti \"era una femminaccia ignorante, sciocca e insolente, che, avvezza nella sua prima giovinezza a cantar pei caff\u00e8 e per le strade, port\u00f2 sul teatro, dove la sola voce la condusse, tutte le abitudini, le maniere e i costumi d'una sfacciata Corisca. Libera nel parlare, pi\u00f9 libera nelle azioni, dedita alla crapola, alle dissolutezze ed alla bottiglia, appariva sempre quello che era in faccia di tutti, non conosceva misure, non aveva ritegni; e, quando alcuna delle sue passioni era stuzzicata dalle difficolt\u00e0 o dalle opposizioni, diventava un aspide, una furia, un demone dell'inferno, che avrebbe bastato a sconvolgere tutto un impero, nonch\u00e9 un teatro\". After getting back to Italy in 1802 autumn, owing to Elizabeth Billington's return to her country, she remained in demand on stage for some years both at La Scala and at la Fenice. With her health failing, her voice was getting more and more spoilt. She was forced to retire even though it would be very shortly before her premature death, in 1806. So marvellous and so powerful her very voice had been that her corpse was eventually subjected to an autopsy which revealed two extraordinarily large lungs.Celletti, La grana, \"San Carlo e Scala\", p. 66.

She had met the flautist Andrew Ashe at the Dublin Rotunda concerts and he now directed the Bath concerts. He introduced her to Venanzio Rauzzini who gave her singing lessons. Rauzzini tried her out at a benefit concert for Ashe and she was then engaged by the \"Catch Club\" in Bath. Her benefit there in 1792 raised enough money to pay off her husband's debts. He left prison in Dublin and took a job as a ship's surgeon and died in 1793 at Portsmouth."]}]}}
