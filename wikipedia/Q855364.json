Industries ancillary to textile production were present in the 19th century, such as coal mining at Tunshill, metalworking at Butterworth Hall, and brickmaking at Newhey. Newhey Brick & Terracotta Works opened in 1899, while Butterworth Hall Colliery was the largest colliery in the Rochdale region, employing around 300 men in 1912.. It was sunk as a commercial venture in 1861, opened fully in 1865, and was acquired by the Platt Brothers in 1881, continuing in their ownership until closure in 1928. Modern sectors in the area include engineering, packaging materials, the dyeing and finishing of textiles and carpets, and ink production. Milnrow constitutes a district centre, and Dale Street, its main thoroughfare, forms a linear commercial area with convenience stores, restaurants and food outlets, and a mix of independent shops and services including hairdressing and legal services. An Aldi supermarket was opened in 2016 by Bianca Walkden, while The Milnrow Balti won the 2019 Curry Life award for Best Restaurant in Greater Manchester. There are smaller, lower-order shops in Newhey. Animal husbandry, grazing and other farming practices occur on pastures at Milnrow's rural fringe."]}, {"page": "Broughton Hall High School", "response": ["* Bianca Walkden, female GB taekwondo player"]}, {"page": "World Taekwondo Championships", "response": ["| align=left| Bianca Walkden || align=left|  || 3 || 0 || 0 || 3"]}, {"page": "European Taekwondo Championships", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |Bianca Walkden"]}, {"page": "May 2010 in sports", "response": ["***+73\u00a0kg:  Rosana Simon Alamo   Anne Caroline Graffe   Iwona Kosiorek   Bianca Walkden "]}, {"page": "Jade Jones (taekwondo)", "response": ["Jade was introduced to taekwondo by her grandfather when he saw her misbehaving at age eight.
