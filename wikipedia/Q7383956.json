He received a red card for a second bookable offence in Southend's 2\u20130 win at Bradford City on 27 August. Despite carrying a slight groin strain, Clohessy put in some assured performances at full-back, and believed shaking off his niggling injury helped him to hit top form for his club. He scored his first Southend goal on 1 January 2011 in a 2\u20130 victory against Oxford United when his long, looping cross evaded Oxford goalkeeper Ryan Clarke and went in off the upright. After the game, Clohessy admitted that the goal was a fluke and that his intention had been to cross the ball."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["A number of players left the club following the end of the 2005\u201306 season.

York won the second leg 1\u20130 away with a Carruthers goal, meaning the tie ended 2\u20130 on aggregate. Following the match, the squad were forced to leave Kenilworth Road through the back of a stand after having missiles thrown at them by a section of Luton fans.
