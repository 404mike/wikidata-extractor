When no motive could be found and no evidence emerged from criminals or British intelligence of a contract or conspiracy to kill Dando, police began to reassess evidence that had been set aside at the start of the inquiry. The only non-circumstantial evidence was a single particle of firearm discharge residue\u2014a speck that matched the ammunition used in the killing. \nHe was convicted of murder but the forensic evidence was later discounted and his conviction was judged unsafe by the Court of Appeal and quashed in 2007. After a retrial, he was acquitted on 1 August 2008.
