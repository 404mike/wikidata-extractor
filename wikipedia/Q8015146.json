When he left school he was apprenticed to a wholesale druggist in Sheffield. In 1816, he moved to London where he took up an apprenticeship to a surgeon-apothecary before setting up on his own. At the end of 1824 he enrolled as a student of surgery at St Bartholomew's Hospital under the famous surgeon and lecturer John Abernethy (1764\u20131831). In April 1827 Marsden passed his MRCS examination to qualify as a full surgeon. He became an MD in 1838. \nAfter discovering the difficulties the poor had in obtaining medical treatment, Marsden sought to establish a free hospital in London for which \"poverty and sickness are the only passports\". In 1828 he set up a small dispensary at 16 Greville Street, Hatton Garden, Holborn, which was named the London General Institution for the Gratuitous Cure of Malignant Diseases. This was later constituted as the Royal Free Hospital, and moved to the Gray's Inn Road in the 1840s. \nA few years later, Marsden turned his attention to cancer sufferers and, in 1851, set up another small establishment in Cannon Row, Westminster. This grew into the Brompton Cancer Hospital (now the Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road site).\nMarsden married Ann Bishop, known as Betsy-Ann, in 1820. They had four children, three sons and a daughter, but only one of them, Alexander Edwin Marsden, a surgeon (1832\u20131902), survived into adulthood. Betsy-Ann died of cancer in 1846 and Marsden married his second wife, Elizabeth Abbott.\nWilliam Marsden died at a hotel in Richmond, Surrey, in 1867. He is buried in West Norwood Cemetery, South London [1].", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1867 in science", "response": ["* January 16 \u2013 William Marsden (born 1796), English surgeon."]}, {"page": "1828 in science", "response": ["* April 17 \u2013 Royal Free Hospital, established as the London General Institution for the Gratuitous Care of Malignant Diseases by surgeon William Marsden, opens."]}, {"page": "1796 in science", "response": ["* August \u2013 William Marsden, English surgeon (died 1867)"]}, {"page": "1851 in science", "response": ["* The Royal Marsden is established as the Free Cancer Hospital by surgeon William Marsden in London, the world's first specialist cancer hospital."]}, {"page": "West Norwood Cemetery", "response": ["* many notable medics, such as: Dr William Marsden, founder of the Royal Free Hospital and The Royal Marsden Hospital, Dr Gideon Mantell, the geologist and pioneering palaeontologist, and Sister Eliza Roberts, Florence Nightingale's principal nurse during the Crimean War"]}, {"page": "Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry", "response": ["* William Marsden \u2013 Surgeon, founder of The Royal Free and Marsden Hospitals"]}, {"page": "Lincoln's Inn Fields", "response": ["Aside from Lindsey House and Powis House, the north side of the square features Sir John Soane's Museum, home of the architect, at numbers 12, 13 and 14.
