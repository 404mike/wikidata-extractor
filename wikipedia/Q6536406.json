It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty to one of the six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges.Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, pp. 162\u2013207 On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison,Aronson, p. 173 which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh.

Known as the Queen of Heeley for her fashionable taste in clothes, Dover was 27 years old at the time, and was Skinner's housekeeper. She was convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to penal servitude for life, which she served at Woking Female Prison. By 1901, she was out of jail. She lived her remaining years with her sisters in Rotherham.", "The trial took place on Monday 6 and Tuesday 7 February 1882 at Leeds Assizes, in the Criminal Court room of Leeds Town Hall.

He argued that Dover had nothing to gain, but, on the contrary, everything to lose by the death of Skinner. He suggested that Dover's motive for the poisoning might not have been to kill, but to make Skinner ill and blame Jones for it, thereby undoing the influence of the objector to the marriage."]}]}}
