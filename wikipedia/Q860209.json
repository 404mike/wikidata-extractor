At that time the Carlist forces comprised no more than a few hundred ill-armed and dispirited guerrilleros; in a few months Zumalac\u00e1rregui had organized them into a regular army. The difficulty he found in obtaining supplies was enormous, for the coast towns and notably Bilbao supported the \"Cristino\" (liberal) cause. It was mainly by seizing equipment from the government troops that he armed his forces. He gradually obtained full possession of the Southern Basque Country, outside of the fortresses, which he had not the means to besiege. He organized the forces known as aduaneros and the Gu\u00edas de Navarra. His chief bodyguard, and later biographer, was Charles Frederick Henningsen.", "The most trustworthy account of Zumalacarregui's Carlist campaign can be found in Juan Antonio de Zaratiegui's Vida y hechos de Don Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui.

Perhaps the most famous filibustering expedition was William Walker's Conquest of Nicaragua in 1855, by which time the country was independent from Spanish rule. A civil war had broken out in 1854 between liberal and conservative forces; the conservatives, or Legitimists, held Granada while the liberals held Leon. Initially Walker had been commissioned by the liberal government of President General Francisco Castell\u00f3n to bring 300 men to aid in the war against the Legitimists, but his real intentions were to take over the country, as he had in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico. Walker sailed from San Francisco in May 1855 with sixty men and when he arrived in Nicaragua his small army of filibusters was increased by about 300 Americans and locals, including the pirate Charles Frederick Henningsen. After a series of battles against both the Legitimists and the liberals, Walker established himself as the ruler of Nicaragua and even received recognition from the American President Franklin Pierce. Recognition didn't last long though, when Walker seized property belonging to Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company, the United States government withdrew their support.", "Soon after that the filibusters engaged in a campaign which ended when 4,000 Salvador and Guatemalan troops besieged Granada. Charles Frederick Henningsen was in command of the city at the time and he only had a few hundred men so there was no choice but to retreat to Lake Nicaragua after burning Granada for a final time. When the city was in flames, Henningsen began his retreat on December 14, 1856, leaving behind a message on a lance which read \"Here was Granada\".

After driving Jose Maria Ca\u00f1as out of La Virgen at the Battle of the Transit on November 11, and with the return of the experienced General Charles Frederick Henningsen to his force, Walker felt confident in his victorious army's ability to retake Masaya. Walker and his men embarked from La Virgen to Granada, there mustering 550 men. On the morning of the 15th, Walker and this force set off in the direction of Masaya. However, halfway to their destination, Walker received news that 800 men under General M\u00e1ximo Jerez had departed Masaya in order to reinforce Ca\u00f1as\u2019 defeated army at Rivas. This newly mobile force threatened the transit link under Walker\u2019s control, so Walker peeled off 200 men with orders to reinforce the garrison left to man the recently captured transit city of La Virgen.
