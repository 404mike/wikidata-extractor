Samuel, a fellow Quaker, was a London corn exchange merchant. The couple went to Manchester in 1845, when Samuel became involved in a cotton mill. The family moved back to London in 1850. Lucas became interested in politics during the anti-corn law protests in 1845. She aided her husband with the organisation of meetings and the raising of finances. Until her husband's death in 1865, however, her main burdens remained within the family, including the rearing of her two children, Samuel, a deaf mute, and Katharine. By 1870, both children had married, Katharine to John Pennington Thomasson (later MP for Bolton).", "Friends and colleagues described Lucas variously as a 'homely British matron', 'well-preserved, erect and vigorous', an 'earnest speaker', and 'tall and stately'. She had an impressive shock of silvery hair into her sixties. The BWTA achieved greater success under her successor, Lady Henry Somerset, but ultimately, British temperance was destined to achieve less than its American counterpart. Lucas was, however, an important link in the Anglo-American women's reform networks as well as being a pioneer in British women's temperance. In 2007, the grave of Margaret and Samuel Lucas was given listed status by the English Heritage in honor of their work in the anti-slavery movement."]}, {"page": "Music and Some Highly Musical People", "response": ["*Samuel Lucas"]}]}}
