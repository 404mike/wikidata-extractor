During this voyage, which was published in 1810, he made observations in Tahiti, Hawaii, and Australia, that have become important texts to the indigenous and settler histories of those places.  Included in these observations were his comments on the mahoo or mahu transgender people of Tahiti, which were transphobic, typically of their time, but part of the LGBT history of the Pacific Islands.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Necker Island (Hawaii)", "response": ["The French explorer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La P\u00e9rouse was on a mission of exploration for the French Academy of Sciences aboard the ships L'Astrolabe (under command of Fleuriot de Langle) and La BoussoleNovaresio, 1996. p. 181 \"Lap\u00e9rouse ships, Astrolabe and Boussole\" that made many discoveries across the Pacific \u2014 and had just discovered the French Frigate Shoals ( Basse des Fr\u00e9gates Fran\u00e7aises) and his namesake rock La Perouse Pinnacle \u2014 when on November 4, 1786, he became the first European to visit Necker Island. La P\u00e9rouse did not attempt to land on the island due to its nearly vertical sides and the violent seas breaking on its shore, but he sailed within a third of a league of it and named it after Jacques Necker, a Genevan banker and statesman who served as finance minister for Louis XVI of France. Although the expedition was lost at sea in 1788, it was able to send its logs home before its loss, bringing the island's existence to the attention of Europeans. The first people to set foot on Necker Island in modern times appear to have been the British seaman John Turnbull of the ship Margaret, who visited the Hawaiian Islands between December 17, 1802, and January 21, 1803, and two Hawaiian pearl divers in his employ; the three men landed on the island during an expedition to find pearls on a reef in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands."]}, {"page": "John Turnbull", "response": ["John Turnbull may refer to:", "*John Turnbull (voyager), English explorer to the Pacific in 1800\u20131805", "*John Turnbull (actor) (1880\u20131956), British film actor", "*John Turnbull (priest) (1905\u20131979), English Anglican priest", "*John Turnbull (cricketer) (born 1935), New Zealand cricketer", "*John Turnbull (musician) (born 1953), English pop and rock guitarist and singer"]}, {"page": "Hawaii\u2013Tahiti relations", "response": ["According to oral traditions the second migration of Polynesians to the Hawaiian islands came from a place to the south called Kahiki, which is often identified as Tahiti. This second migration allegedly replaced some of the older Marquesan settlers and formed the new ali\u02bbi social class. Communication between the two regions ceased for more than 500 years before the arrival of Captain James Cook, who was already famous for exploring the Pacific islands, including Tahiti. Cook and his crew noted the similarity between the Tahitian and Hawaiian languages; many of his crewmen were able to communicate with the Hawaiians. Some of the first Tahitians came to Hawaii aboard foreign vessels as sailors or translators. In 1804, British Captain John Turnbull took a Tahitian couple to Kauai. Tahitian missionaries led by William Ellis from the London Missionary Society arrived to assist the American missionaries in Hawaii."]}]}}
