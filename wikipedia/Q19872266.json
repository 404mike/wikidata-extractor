Davies spoke for 90 minutes to \"talk out\" the bill proposed by Labour MP Julie Cooper. He said he objected to the bill because he was concerned it would cause higher parking charges for disabled people and a reduction in revenue for hospitals. The comedian Russell Howard in his programme Good News, called him an \"arsehole\", \"windbag\", \"wanker\" and a \"toad-faced hypocrite\" and accused the MP of filibustering. Davies complained on the grounds of \"inaccuracy\" and \"misrepresentation\" and the BBC was forced to publish in the Clarifications and Corrections section of the BBC website stating \"Davies did not personally use up all the time available for the debate and that almost three hours remained after he sat down\". Howard also misrepresented Davies' views on the disabled and the BBC stated \"that the programme did not fully represent his comments, which were, that it would be in the best interests of disabled people, and others, to be allowed to offer to work for less than the minimum wage, if the alternative were no employment at all\". The broadcaster also agreed not to air the episode again due to their misrepresentation of Davies' position. The BBC Trust later rejected an escalation of the complaint by Davies."]}, {"page": "List of Parliamentary constituencies in Lancashire", "response": ["|Julie Cooper\u2021"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Julie Cooper, Burnley, 2015\u20132019"]}, {"page": "Edge Hill University", "response": ["*Julie Cooper MP (Member of Parliament and Shadow Health Minister)"]}, {"page": "2008 Burnley Borough Council election", "response": ["Police launched an investigation on the day of the election into a fake Liberal Democrat leaflet which was distributed in Rosegrove and Gannow wards.
