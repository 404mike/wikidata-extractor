Gaines in his 1996 paper \"Convergence to the Information Highway\" saw the World Wide Web as an extension of Wells's \"World Brain\" that individuals can access using personal computers. In papers published in 1996 and 1997 that did not cite Wells, Francis Heylighen and Ben Goertzel envisaged the further development of the World Wide Web into a global brain, i.e. an intelligent network of people and computers at the planetary level. The difference between \"global brain\" and \"world brain\" is that the latter, as envisaged by Wells, is centrally controlled, while the former is fully decentralised and self-organizing."]}, {"page": "Personal construct theory", "response": ["In the book Personal Construct Methodology, researchers Brian R.
