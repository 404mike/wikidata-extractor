He published some early poems in magazines like Paris Review and  Brian Patten's Underdog. In 1969 his poetry was published in the anthology Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain.  \nIn the mid-sixties he began performing as a puppeteer, participating in numerous international festivals and appearing on So It Goes, the TV show hosted by Tony Wilson. He contributed a short scene for Terry Gilliam's film Jabberwocky.\nIn Eric Clapton's autobiography he describes hanging out with Ted at Milton's girlfriend Clarissa's apartment often in the summer of 1965. \"Ted was the most extraordinary man. A poet and a visionary ... he was the first person I ever saw physically interpreting music ... to enact it with his entire being, dancing and employing facial expressions to interpret what he was hearing. Watching him, I understood for the first time how you could really live music, how you could listen to it and completely make it come alive, so that it was part of your life. It was a real awakening.\"In the late 1970s, he began to play alto saxophone and founded the group Blurt. The first single \"My Mother Was a Friend of an Enemy of the People\" was soon followed by the live album In Berlin (1981). Since then Blurt have released more than 20 records. They continue to tour and the new album Beneath Discordant Skies will be out in the autumn of 2015. While living in Brussels in the mid-1990s, Milton started making book-objects with found materials. These were shown at several exhibitions and have been taken up in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris as well as in the British Library.\nTed Milton also makes art objects and installations, having had shows at Nadine in Brussels and at the bookstore Tropisme, also in Brussels,\nIn 2001, Milton staged an homage to the Russian author of the absurd Daniil Kharms, \"In Kharm's Way\", a mixture of music, puppeteering and spoken word, with the electronic musician Sam Britton. In 2007 he collaborated again with Sam Britton in the \"ODES\"-project; an overview of 25 years solo work outside Blurt. Also Milton has recently completed \"Elegiac\" - a collaboration with Graham Lewis from the band Wire and Sam Britton (Icarus).\nPlans are currently afoot to publish The Milton Text Book, a selection of his lyrics funded through kickstarter.\nMilton now lives in Deptford, Southeast London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Puppeteer", "response": ["* Ted Milton (British poet, performer and musician)"]}, {"page": "Steve Beresford", "response": ["He has also worked with a number of popular musicians, including Ray Davis, The Slits, Frank Chickens, Ted Milton and The Flying Lizards.
