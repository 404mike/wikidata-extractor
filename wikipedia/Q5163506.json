Before her marriage to Frank Benson, she was known by the stage name Constance Featherstonhaugh, pronounced \"Fanshaw\" ().\nBorn in British India into a military family, and christened Gertrude Constance Cockburn Samwell, she took to the stage under the name of Featherstonhaugh, which was the middle name of her father, Morshead Featherstonhaugh Samwell. She married the actor Frank Benson in 1886, and they had two children, Eric William (1887\u20131916), killed at the battle of the Somme, and Brynhild Lucy (1888\u20131974).When Benson played Cleopatra in 1898, reviewers were astonished by her \"terrible rage\", one commenting that she treated a struck-down messenger so violently that only the intervention of Charmian had saved his life. One critic later claimed that \"Benson and his companies never shook off the aura of amateurism\", and that some of the parts Constance Benson had played \"owed more to her husband's loyalty than to her talent\".As an actress, Constance Benson worked in the theatre, but in 1911 she also appeared in leading roles in four silent films, all adaptations of William Shakespeare plays: Richard III, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and The Taming of the Shrew.\nIn 1916 Constance became Lady Benson. After F. R. Benson's love affair with the young actress Genevieve Townsend (d. 1927), the couple separated but did not divorce, and in 1940 Benson attended her husband's funeral as his widow.\nDuring the First World War, in which her son Eric was killed, Benson worked in a canteen for soldiers in France. In 1917 her daughter Brynhild married firstly Charles Chalmers, in 1931 secondly Harold G. Janion, and in 1951 thirdly Richard C. Kelly.In the 1920s, Benson became a writer, and her published books are her autobiography Mainly Players (1926); two novels, The Chimera (1928), about \"an ice-cold, egotistical, twenty-eight-year-old artist\", with a frustrated wife, and Cuckoo Oats (1929). She also wrote an acting manual and in the 1920s began a drama school, at which one of her students was Elvira Mullens, later Elvira Barney.Benson's autobiography Mainly Players has an introduction by Arthur Machen, who had been a member of the Benson company from 1901 to 1909.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Machen", "response": ["*Constance Benson's autobiography Mainly Players (Butterworth, 1926) has an introduction by Machen, who had been a member of the Benson company from 1901 to 1909.Arthur Machen & Montgomery Evans: Letters of a Literary Friendship, 1923-1947 (1994), p. 170"]}, {"page": "Henry VI, Part 1", "response": ["After the original 1592 performances, the complete text of 1 Henry VI seems to have been rarely acted.

Griffith's eleven-minute The Taming of the Shrew, made for Biograph in 1908, starring Florence Lawrence as Katherina and Arthur V. Johnson as Petruchio. The blurb for the film stated \"if we could see ourselves as others see us what models we would become.\" Also released in Italy in 1908 was the seven-minute La bisbetica domata, directed by Azeglio Pineschi and Lamberto Pineschi. There is no known cast list for this film. Unlike all other silent adaptations, this version retains the Katherina/Bianca sibling rivalry. In 1911, F.R. Benson directed a twelve-minute silent filmed extract from his own Shakespeare Memorial Theatre production, starring himself and his wife, Constance Benson. The film presented a heavily truncated pantomime version of the story, with pieces of Shakespeare's original text used as intertitles throughout. It is now believed lost, although several stills survive in the library archives of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.  Also released in France in 1911 was La m\u00e9g\u00e8re apprivois\u00e9e, directed by Henri Desfontaines and starring Madeleine Barjac and Romauld Joub\u00e9. It is thought to be the first version to show scenes which take place off-stage in the play; in this case, the wedding and the journey to Petruchio's house. A 1913 Italian version, the twenty-two-minute La bisbetica domata, was directed by Arrigo Frusta and starred Gigetta Morano and Eleuterio Rodolfi. This version also shows scenes not in the play. Another English adaptation was released in 1915, directed by and starring Arthur Backner. This version is also lost. Intended more as a showcase for a new type of sound system than an adaptation of the play, the film consisted entirely of the scene where Petruchio and Katherina first meet. Shot using a process known as Voxograph, the actors spoke the complete text during filming, and when the film was played at the theatre, \"the same actors, one at each side of the screen but unseen, repeated the words in what was supposed to be synchronisation. It was expected that the operator, after rehearsal, would be able to project the film so that picture and voice would jibe.\" The earliest surviving British filmic adaptation is Edwin J. Collins' 1923 version, adapted by Eliot Stannard, and starring Dacia Deane and Lauderdale Maitland. One of a series of forty-minute adaptations of classic texts released under the Gems of Literature banner, only the second half of the film survives, and the final scene is incomplete as a result of print damage. This version very much adopts Petruchio's perspective, and one of the intertitles reads \"by noon the next day, though famished and weary for want of food and rest, the Shrew deep in her heart admired the man whose temper is greater than her own.\""]}, {"page": "The Taming of the Shrew in performance", "response": ["The first major production in England after Daly's success was that of F.R. Benson. Originally performed in the Prince's Theatre, Manchester in 1889, the production then moved to the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1890, before settling at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1893, where it became one of the most popular and often performed plays in Benson's repertory. The play was regularly performed there until the 1920s and was revived at theatres around the country up to 1932. Starring Benson's wife, Constance Benson and Benson himself as Petruchio, Benson followed Daly's example in rewriting and restructuring, such as truncating the Bianca subplot. Unlike Daly, however, Benson also removed the Induction. The production was very much a farce, with the emphasis on broad physical comedy in which Petruchio athletically leaps about the stage terrorizing a relatively passive Katherina. In its early days, it received generally strong reviews, but by 1910, the political climate had changed somewhat; the 1909 Stratford by-election had seen suffragette protests, and henceforth some critics expressed discomfort with Benson's use of farce to depict what had now become a socially relevant situation. Indeed, in the 1912 season, suffragette activist Violet Vanbrugh replaced Constance Benson in the role of Katherina, although her performance was roundly criticised for failing to bring the anticipated political edge to the character."]}, {"page": "Elvira Barney", "response": ["In 1924, Elvira attended Lady Benson's Drama Academy, studying under Constance Benson.
