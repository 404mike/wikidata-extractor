He also represented Mansfield Town and Kettering Town.\nBob was born in Langwith Whaley-Thorns in Nottinghamshire and was scouted by Charlton Athletic whilst playing as a striker for local side Shirebrook Town. He signed for Charlton in February 1967, and was given his chance in the first team after Billy Bonds had been sold to West Ham United.\nCurtis represented Charlton Athletic for 12 seasons, and in that time, he made 337 league appearances for the Addicks, and scored 35 goals. He was famously once expelled from the England under-23 squad after he dyed his hair blonde, to make him look like his idol Bobby Moore.After a disagreement with the Charlton management staff, Curtis was sold to Mansfield Town in his native East Midlands for an undisclosed fee in March 1978. During his time with the Stags, he made 73 league appearances for the club, and 87 in all competitions, scoring seven goals. An achilles injury forced him to retire from full-time football in 1980, and he subsequently played one season for non-league Kettering Town before hanging up his boots in 1981.\nCurtis died in March 2010, aged 60, after a lengthy battle against motor neurone disease (known as Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS in North America).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2010 in association football", "response": ["* 19 March - Bob Curtis, English footballer (60)"]}, {"page": "Robert Curtis", "response": ["* Bob Curtis (actor) (1932\u20132004), American actor and priest", "* Bob Curtis (American football) (1935\u20132013), American football coach", "* Bob Curtis (footballer) (1950\u20132010), English football player", "* Bob Curtis (politician) (born 1933), American politician"]}, {"page": "List of Charlton Athletic F.C. players", "response": ["|Bob Curtis||||DF/MF||1966\u201378||372||38"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 in English football", "response": ["*19 March 2010 \u2013 Bob Curtis, 60, former right-back who made more than 350 appearances for Charlton Athletic during an 11-year spell at The Valley.
