A Guardian review called his music \"a cross between the music of Ian Dury, Brecht and Weill, an Irish pub band, and a 1950s skiffle group. The urban-alienation songs might be too explicitly crammed with messages for some, but plenty of fierce, spontaneous playing\".Burch and band has toured internationally, with a significant following in Russia and Austria. Burch's self described \"morbid drawings\" are represented by The Nicholas Treadwell Gallery, have been shown in the UK, Austria, and Germany, and been published in a number of magazines.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kevin Coyne", "response": ["# \"Black Cloud\" \u2013 Nigel Burch"]}]}}
