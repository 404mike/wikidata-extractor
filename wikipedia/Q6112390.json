To make matters worse, the Whalers reputation of making disastrous trades began to unfold, as the team began to trade away stars for mediocre players in an attempt to gain depth. For instance, they traded star defenseman Mark Howe and their first NHL scoring leader, Mike Rogers, in separate deals for players and draft picks which never panned out, and also swapped defensive-defenseman Gordie Roberts, who would go on to play 15 remaining professional seasons, for the remaining half of the season of Mike Fidler's NHL career. For the 1981\u201382 season, the NHL realigned its divisions and the Whalers were resituated in the Adams Division of the Wales Conference. The Whalers bottomed out in the 1982\u201383 season with a record of 19\u201354\u20137 (45 points), ranked 20th out of 21 teams in the NHL standings. On May 2, 1983, the Whalers hired Emile Francis as their new general manager to rebuild the team. About two months later, on July 7, Francis hired Jack Evans to be the Whalers' new head coach. By the end of the 1986\u201387 season, Francis had cut or traded away every player from the 1982\u201383 Whalers' roster save for Ron Francis, Paul MacDermid, and Paul Lawless."]}, {"page": "Drumheller", "response": ["* Jack Evans (1928\u20131996), professional ice hockey player "]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 NHL season", "response": ["*Hartford Whalers: Jack Evans"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 NHL season", "response": ["*Hartford Whalers: Jack Evans"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 NHL season", "response": ["*Hartford Whalers: Jack Evans"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 NHL season", "response": ["*Hartford Whalers: Jack Evans"]}, {"page": "List of Hartford Whalers head coaches", "response": ["|Jack Evans"]}, {"page": "Cleveland Barons (NHL)", "response": ["* Jack Evans, 1976\u20131978"]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 NHL season", "response": ["By this season, the Chicago Black Hawks were a strong team.
