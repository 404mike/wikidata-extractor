He was hired by the society to try to get slavery immediately abolished on moral and religious grounds, a concept called \"immediatism.\" He quickly took up the dissemination of the Society's creed: \"To uphold slavery is a crime before God, and the condition must, therefore, be immediately abolished.\" In 1832 he travelled to Scotland, where he gained an interest in the abolition of slavery in the United States and other parts of the world. While in Scotland he also met William Lloyd Garrison, who would remain a lifelong friend and colleague, as well as Nathaniel Paul, an African-American abolitionist. In Glasgow in 1833 he debated with Peter Borthwick, who had been appointed by the West India Association to defend slavery.Whyte, Iain.
