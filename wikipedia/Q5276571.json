The family placed a high value on education. Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans. A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception. From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components."]}, {"page": "Tigran (name)", "response": ["* Dikran Tahta (1928\u20132006), British-Armenian mathematician, teacher and author"]}, {"page": "Armenians in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Dikran Tahta, mathematician and teacher"]}]}}
