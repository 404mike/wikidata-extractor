The FAW would also be responsible for the wages and insurance of the players during the time away, a stipulation that placed increasing strain on the organisation's already stretched finances. In practice, the more inclusive ruling provided little improvement as the FAW's release requests for players were continually rejected; during the 1931\u201332 British Home Championship, Wales finished bottom after losing all their matches having used 26 players in only three games. This included Eddie Parris, who became the first black player to represent Wales. The FAW subsequently gave in to the Football League and agreed to hold matches in midweek to avoid a fixture clash. The decision proved astute as Wales defeated Scotland 5\u20132 in the opening game of the 1932\u201333 tournament. Fred Keenor won his 32nd and final international cap in the game, earning praise for his performance. A goalless draw with England and a 4\u20131 victory over Ireland secured Wales' fifth Home Championship title."]}]}}
