However, the late 1st-millennium CE Indic consensus had \"indeed come to conceptualize a complex entity corresponding to Hinduism as opposed to Buddhism and Jainism excluding only certain forms of antinomian Shakta-Shaiva\" from its fold. Some in the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy considered the Agamas such as the Pancaratrika to be invalid because it did not conform to the Vedas. Some Kashmiri scholars rejected the esoteric tantric traditions to be a part of Vaidika dharma. The Atimarga Shaivism ascetic tradition, datable to about 500 CE, challenged the Vaidika frame and insisted that their Agamas and practices were not only valid, they were superior than those of the Vaidikas. However, adds Sanderson, this Shaiva ascetic tradition viewed themselves as being genuinely true to the Vedic tradition and \"held unanimously that the \u015aruti and Sm\u1e5bti of Brahmanism are universally and uniquely valid in their own sphere, [...] and that as such they [Vedas] are man's sole means of valid knowledge [...]\".", "According to the Indologist Alexis Sanderson, before Islam arrived in India, the \"Sanskrit sources differentiated Vaidika, Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, \u015aaiva, \u015a\u0101kta, Saura, Buddhist, and Jaina traditions, but they had no name that denotes the first five of these as a collective entity over and against Buddhism and Jainism\". This absence of a formal name, states Sanderson, does not mean that the corresponding concept of Hinduism did not exist. By late 1st-millennium CE, the concept of a belief and tradition distinct from Buddhism and Jainism had emerged. This complex tradition accepted in its identity almost all of what is currently Hinduism, except certain antinomian tantric movements. Some conservative thinkers of those times questioned whether certain Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta texts or practices were consistent with the Vedas, or were invalid in their entirety. Moderates then, and most orthoprax scholars later, agreed that though there are some variations, the foundation of their beliefs, the ritual grammar, the spiritual premises, and the soteriologies were the same. \"This sense of greater unity\", states Sanderson, \"came to be called Hinduism\"."]}, {"page": "Tantra", "response": ["Alexis Sanderson has argued that tantric practices originally developed in a \u015aaiva milieu and was later adopted by Buddhists. He cites numerous elements that are found in the \u015aaiva Vidyapitha literature, including whole passages and lists of pithas, that seem to have been directly borrowed by Vajrayana texts.Sanderson, Alexis \"Vajray\u0101na: Origin and Function\". In: Buddhism into the Year 2000. International Conference Proceedings, Bangkok and Los Angeles: Dhammak\u0101ya Foundation (1995), pp. 89\u2013102. This has been criticized by Ronald M. Davidson however, due to the uncertain date of the Vidyapitha texts. Davidson argues that the pithas seem to have been neither uniquely Buddhist nor \u015aaiva, but frequented by both groups. He also states that the \u015aaiva tradition was also involved in the appropriation of local deities and that tantra may have been influenced by tribal Indian religions and their deities. Samuel writes that \"the female divinities may well best be understood in terms of a distinct \u015a\u0101kta milieu from which both \u015aaivas and Buddhists were borrowing,\" but that other elements, like the Kapalika style practices, are more clearly derived from a \u015aaiva tradition.", "Though the whole northern and Himalayan part of India was involved in the development of tantra, Kashmir was a particularly important center, both Saiva and Buddhist and numerous key tantric texts were written there according to Padoux. According to Alexis Sanderson, the \u015aaiva Tantra traditions of medieval Kashmir were mainly divided between the dualistic \u015aaiva Siddhanta and the non-dualist theology found in \u015aakta lineages like the Trika, Krama and Kaula. The non-dualists generally accepted and made use of sexual and transgressive practices, while the dualists mostly rejected them. Saiva tantra was especially successful because it managed to forge strong ties with South Asian kings who valued the power (shakti) of fierce deities like the warrior goddess Durga as a way to increase their own royal power. These kings took part in royal rituals led by Saiva \"royal gurus\" in which they were symbolically married to tantric deities and thus became the earthly representative of male gods like Shiva. Saiva tantra could also employ a variety of protection and destruction rituals which could be used for the benefit of the kingdom and the king. Tantric Shaivism was adopted by the kings of Kashmir, as well as by the Somavamshis of Odisha, the Kalachuris, and the Chandelas of Jejakabhukti (in Bundelkhand). There is also evidence of state support from the Cambodian Khmer Empire. As noted by Samuel, in spite of the increased depiction of female goddesses, these tantric traditions all seemed to have been mostly \"male-directed and male-controlled.\"", "During the 10th century, the syncretic Nondual School of Kashmir \u015aaivism developed. According to Alexis Sanderson, this tradition arose out of the confrontation between the dualistic and more orthodox \u015aaiva Siddh\u0101nta and the nondual transgressive traditions of the Trika and Krama. According to David B. Gray, this school integrated elements from both of these traditions, \"the end result was a nondualistic system in which the transgressive elements were internalized and hence rendered less offensive to the orthodox.\""]}, {"page": "Vajrayana", "response": ["According to Alexis Sanderson, various classes of Vajray\u0101na literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Shaivism.Sanderson, Alexis. \"The \u015aaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of \u015aaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo.

The Lakula Shaiva ascetic recognized no act nor words as forbidden, he freely did whatever he felt like, much like the classical depiction of his deity Rudra in ancient Hindu texts. However, according to Alexis Sanderson, the Lakula ascetic was strictly celibate and did not engage in sex.", "The sun god called Surya is an ancient deity of Hinduism, and several ancient Hindu kingdoms particularly in the northwest and eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent revered Surya. These devotees called Sauras once had a large corpus of theological texts, and Shaivism literature reverentially acknowledges these. For example, the Shaiva text Srikanthiyasamhita mentions 85 Saura texts, almost all of which are believed to have been lost during the Islamic invasion and rule period, except for large excerpts found embedded in Shaiva manuscripts discovered in the Himalayan mountains. Shaivism incorporated Saura ideas, and the surviving Saura manuscripts such as Saurasamhita acknowledge the influence of Shaivism, according to Alexis Sanderson, assigning \"itself to the canon of Shaiva text Vathula-Kalottara.", "Yoga and meditation has been an integral part of Shaivism, and it has been a major innovator of techniques such as those of Hatha Yoga.Alexis Sanderson (1999), YOGA IN \u015aAIVISM , Oxford University, pages 1-7 Many major Shiva temples and Shaiva tritha (pilgrimage) centers depict anthropomorphic iconography of Shiva as a giant statue wherein Shiva is a loner yogi meditating, as do Shaiva texts.", "According to Alexis Sanderson, the link and development of Shaiva goddesses into Jaina goddess is more transparent than a similar connection between Shaivism and Buddhism. The 11th-century Jain text \u2018\u2019Bhairavapadmavatikalpa\u2019\u2019, for example, equates Padmavati of Jainism with Tripura-bhairavi of Shaivism and Shaktism.

Some hold that it originated as a monistic doctrine, espoused by Kashmiri northern shaivites (date unknown). It seems likely to others, however, that the early \u015aaiva Siddh\u0101nta may have developed somewhere in  India, as a religion built around the notion of a ritual initiation that conferred liberation. Such a notion of liberatory initiation appears to have been borrowed from a Pashupata (p\u0101\u015bupata) tradition.See Alexis Sanderson's The L\u0101kulas: New evidence of a system intermediate between P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101rthika P\u0101\u015bupatism and \u0100gamic \u015aaivism.

For example, some later texts such as the Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra and the Sarvadurgatipari\u015bodhana Tantra begin to speak of the importance of protecting Buddhist teachings and that killing is allowed if necessary for this reason. Later Buddhist literature also begins to see kings as bodhisattvas and their actions as being in line with the dharma (Buddhist kings like Devapala and Jayavarman VII also claimed this). Bronkhorst also thinks that the increase in the use of apotropaic rituals (including for the protection of the state and king) and spells (mantras) by 7th century Indian Buddhism is also a response to Brahmanical and Shaiva influence. These included fire sacrifices, which were performed under the rule of Buddhist king Dharmapala (r. c. 775\u2013812). Alexis Sanderson has shown that Tantric Buddhism is filled with imperial imagery reflecting the realities of medieval India, and that in some ways work to sanctify that world. Perhaps because of these changes, Buddhism remained indebted to Brahmanical thought and practice now that it had adopted much of its worldview. Bronkhorst argues that these somewhat drastic changes \"took them far from the ideas and practices they had adhered to during the early centuries of their religion, and dangerously close to their much-detested rivals.\" These changes which brought Buddhism closer to Hinduism, eventually made it much easier for Buddhism to be absorbed into Hinduism."]}, {"page": "Indology", "response": ["* Alexis Sanderson  (1948\u2013present) Emeritus Fellow and former Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at All Souls College, Oxford"]}, {"page": "Cakrasa\u1e43vara Tantra", "response": ["According to David B.
