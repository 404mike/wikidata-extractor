The Association immediately proceeded to choose a candidate and on 21 July the Executive decided to recommend Henry Harris, one of the constituency's representatives on the London County Council, as the new candidate. Shortly thereafter the South Paddington Liberal Association chose a locally-resident barrister, F. T. H. Henl\u00e9, as their candidate. The circumstances of the election, in which the Conservatives highlighted the tax increases of the 1909 budget, helped Harris improve on Fardell's 1906 majority. The election of December was essentially a rerun of that in January.", "*Unionist: Henry Harris", "In June 1921, Sir Henry Harris (as he had become known, to stop him being confused with the leading Liberal Percy A. Harris on the London County council) announced that he would not contest the next general election. That November, Captain Douglas King was selected. King was a Government Whip and sitting MP for North Norfolk having won it at the 1918 election, but feared (correctly, as it turned out) that it would not be possible to keep it Conservative."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Henry Harrison-Broadley"]}, {"page": "Henry Harris", "response": ["Henry Harris may refer to:", "*Henry Harris (English cricketer) (1854\u20131923), English cricketer", "*Henry Harris (Australian cricketer) (1865\u20131933), Australian cricketer", "*Henry Harris (ice hockey) (1905\u20131975), Canadian ice hockey player", "*Henry Harris (American football) (born c. 1965), former American college football player", "*Henry Harris (baseball), Negro league baseball player", "* Henry Harris (actor) (1634\u20131704), English actor and theatre manager", "*Sir Henry Harris (scientist) (1925\u20132014), Australian pioneer in medicine in the fields of oncology and human genetics ", "*Henry Harris (cinematographer) (1899\u20131971), British cinematographer", "*Henry Harris (anatomist) (1885\u20131968), Professor of Anatomy at Cambridge University"]}]}}
