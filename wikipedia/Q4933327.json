The club's most notable achievement that season was in the Scottish Qualifying Cup. Then considerably more prestigious than now, Queen's brought the cup to the South West for the first time in its 25-year history. In the final replay, a run through the opposition half and shot from Bob McDermid (on loan at Queen's from Rangers before going on to captain Aberdeen) opened the scoring. Next, McDermid's \"dummy\" let Bert Lister in to hit the second. McDermid's left-foot finish sealed the 3\u20130 win and Queen's were crowned cup winners.
