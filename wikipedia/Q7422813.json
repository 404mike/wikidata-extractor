The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the Ninth Doctor and Rose Tyler were a couple, which they vehemently denied.

Rose mentions sharing a mortgage with him if he were to ever be trapped with her in \"The Satan Pit\". At the end of series 2, in \"Doomsday\", Rose and the Doctor are forcibly separated. The Doctor \"burns up a sun to say goodbye\" and responds to Rose saying \"I love you\" with a cut-off sentence that is almost certainly \"I love you too\".
