However, he suffered a knee injury midway through the season in the FA Cup fourth round tie against Chelsea. He was injured ten minutes into the match but played for most of the first half before being substituted. He had a chipped bone and ligament damage, requiring him to undergo an operation in February 1969 that forced him to miss the rest of the campaign.Thomas (2005), p. 185 Despite missing many games, he was Preston's top scorer that season with 20 goals in all competitions. Irvine never fully recovered from the injury, and played only 16 games the following season, scoring five goals. Preston North End were relegated to the Football League Third Division in 1970 after finishing bottom of the league. Manager Bobby Seith was dismissed following the relegation, and replaced by former Halifax Town coach Alan Ball in May 1970. Ball was reluctant to play Irvine after discovering the knee injury from the previous season. Nevertheless, he appeared in the first three matches of the 1970\u201371 campaign, scoring in the 1\u20130 win against Stockport County in the first round of the League Cup.Thomas (2005), p. 193 He was dropped from the team after missing several chances in the 1\u20133 defeat to Torquay United on 22 August 1970. After this, Irvine did not feature regularly for Preston North End and from October 1970, he played mostly for the reserve team. He made his final senior appearance for the club on 26 December 1970 in the 3\u20133 draw with Tranmere Rovers at Deepdale.Thomas (2005), p. 194 During a three-year spell, he played 81 league games for Preston North End, scoring 27 goals in the process.", "Irvine added to his tally with home and away goals against Halifax Town, where he would go on to play the next season, and a strike against Aston Villa that was named as runner-up in a Goal of the Season competition by television programme Match of the Day. With the forward partnership of Irvine and Kit Napier, Brighton performed better than expected in the 1971\u201372 season. At the end of the campaign, following a 1\u20131 draw with Rochdale the team was promoted to the Second Division, after finishing as runners-up behind Aston Villa.Thomas (2005), p. 199 Irvine continued to score in a higher division, netting five times in the first eleven matches of the season. However, he was then dropped from the team and never regained his place in the starting line-up. Several clubs became interested in his services, including West Ham United, a number of American teams, and Scottish side Heart of Midlothian, where Bobby Seith was the manager.Thomas (2005), pp. 212\u2013214 Irvine played his last match for Brighton on 18 November 1972, when the team lost 0\u20131 at home to his former club Burnley."]}]}}
