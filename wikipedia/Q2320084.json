In his new position, Busby built up a reputation as an intelligent player and a finer passer of the ball. In 1930, Manchester United made an enquiry about signing Busby from their cross-town rivals, but they were unable to afford the \u00a3150 fee that City demanded. By the 1931\u201332 season, Busby was firmly established in the first team, missing just one match that season. Indeed, Busby and Jackie Bray became such fixtures at wing-half that club captain Jimmy McMullan had to move to forward to keep his place in the team. In the 1930s Manchester City performed strongly in the FA Cup. They reached the semi-finals in 1932, and the final in 1933 before finally winning the tournament in 1934. However, from the second half of the 1934\u201335 season, Busby's number 4 jersey was worn by Jack Percival with increasing regularity, and Busby was sold to Liverpool for \u00a38,000 on 12 March 1936, having made more than 200 appearances for Manchester City."]}, {"page": "George Ramsay", "response": ["In 1926, at the age of 71, Ramsay retired as secretary and became honorary advisor and a vice-president of the Club. His replacement W. J. Smith was unable to continue Ramsay's success, although the club did finish runners-up in the league twice under his guidance. In 1934 Smith stood down and the club decided to appoint its first manager, Jimmy McMullan. The following year Ramsay died at the age of 80. Within a year of his death the Midlands giants were relegated, an unthinkable notion in the Ramsay era."]}, {"page": "Billy Walker (footballer, born 1897)", "response": ["He managed Nottingham Forest from 1939 to 1960, bringing promotion to the First Division in 1956\u201357 and an FA Cup final triumph two years later (beating former team Aston Villa in the semi-finals), becoming the only manager to win the trophy both before and after the second World War. He died in November 1964, four years after retiring as Nottingham Forest manager (and on the same day as another former Sheffield Wednesday manager, Jimmy McMullan)."]}, {"page": "Denny, Falkirk", "response": ["* Jimmy McMullan, professional footballer"]}]}}
