Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a championship winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton had to work with some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["* Jim Platt (481)", "|1972|| Jim Platt and  Stuart Boam", "|1981|| Jim Platt"]}, {"page": "Gateshead F.C.", "response": ["|1997||Jim Platt"]}, {"page": "Ballymena United F.C.", "response": ["Teenage goalkeeper Jim Platt was transferred to Middlesbrough (where he won 21 caps for Northern Ireland) for \u00a37,000 and Ballymena Council purchased the Showgrounds in two major off the field happenings.", "Russell failed to take the Sky Blues to the next level, despite bringing Northern Ireland goalkeeper Jim Platt back home and also seen the late George Best turn out for the Sky Blues in a Friendly against Scottish side Motherwell.
