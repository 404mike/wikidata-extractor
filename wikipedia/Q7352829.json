Robin Trott was placed in temporary charge as player-manager in April 2006 and, after an unbeaten five game run, was given a one-year contract at the end of the season. After Margate narrowly missed out on the play-offs in 2006\u201307 the club announced that Trott was to be given a new contract for the 2007\u201308 season. Shortly before the end of the season, however, Trott was sacked. His replacement, Barry Ashby, was himself sacked two months into the 2008\u201309 season. Shortly afterwards, the club narrowly avoided being subject to High Court action over unpaid debts to HM Revenue and Customs. The club finished the season in 19th position in the table and was expected to be relegated to Division One South, but was reprieved due to other clubs folding. The following season, Margate again finished in the bottom four but the club again received a reprieve from relegation."]}, {"page": "Stevenage F.C.", "response": ["* 1999   Robin Trott"]}, {"page": "List of Margate F.C. managers", "response": ["In the late 1980s and early 1990s former professional players such as Tommy Taylor and Mark Weatherly managed the club with little success, but in 1996, former Dover Athletic manager, Chris Kinnear, took charge and oversaw the club's rise to the Conference National, the highest level of non-league football. The club experienced various off-field problems during this period and had fallen back to the Isthmian League Premier Division by the time Kinnear was dismissed in 2006, with former Gillingham player Robin Trott taking over.
