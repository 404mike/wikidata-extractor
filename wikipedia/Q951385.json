During the Second World War he offered his services to Nazi Germany as a spy and subsequently became a British double agent. His British Secret Service handlers codenamed him Agent Zigzag in acknowledgement of his erratic personal history.\nHe had a number of criminal aliases known by the British police, amongst them Edward Edwards, Arnold Thompson and Edward Simpson. His German codename was Fritz or, later, after endearing himself to his German contacts, its diminutive form of Fritzchen.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 11", "response": ["*1997 \u2013 Eddie Chapman, English spy (b. 1914)"]}, {"page": "November 16", "response": ["*1914 \u2013 Eddie Chapman, English spy (d. 1997)"]}, {"page": "Sabotage", "response": ["During World War II, British subject Eddie Chapman, trained by the Germans in sabotage, became a double agent for the British.
