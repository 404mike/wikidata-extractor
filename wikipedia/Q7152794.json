Like many writers of the time, Borden reached for new techniques and forms to describe the unprecedented scale and impact of a global conflict. Contemporary readers were disturbed by the graphic \u2013 sometimes hallucinatory \u2013 quality of her work, coming as it did from a woman with first-hand experience of life on the front line. A present-day editor of her work, Paul O'Prey, contends that Borden is \u201cthe great forgotten voice of the war \u2013 the outstanding female voice of the first world war. Her poetry can stand alongside anything.\"The Forbidden Zone is a fictionalised and experimental memoir which mixes prose and poetry to give an account of Borden's experience during the war. Researcher Ariela Freedman describes it thus:It is one of the most powerful and one of the most experimental pieces of writing to have emerged from the war. Although Borden's preface asserts the truth of her account, her method is more imagistic than documentary. Indeed, she wrote a surreal memoir about the war during a period when most war memoirs were written as conventional autobiographies. Neither a record nor a chronicle, nor, like May Sinclair's, a series of impressions, her war memoir attempted to register the impact of World War I through innovative aesthetic strategies. Borden mixes the genres of essay, fiction, and poetry, and blurs the lines between documentary and fiction. Beginning with the unfocused, muddy fields of Belgium, she portrays war as a series of phantasmic dislocations, an apocalyptic landscape marked by the posthuman incursion of the war machine. She describes the men and women of the war as displaced inhabitants of a strange, hallucinated world where people are reduced to bodies and functions.The Forbidden Zone contains five long poems that describe what she saw and did working in the military hospital, which are full of passionate energy and compassion. O'Prey finds them reminiscent of Walt Whitman who also tended to the wounded on the battlefield, in his case during the American Civil War.", "Borden's poetry on the war, and about her affair with Spears, were not published in book form until 2015, one hundred years after they were written. Mary Borden, Poems of Love and War, edited by Paul O'Prey, was published in London by Dare-Gale Press, distributed by the University of Chicago Press in the US.

Yet, as James Guetti shows in his essay \" 'Heart of Darkness': The Failure of Imagination\", the story \" \u2026 as the account of a journey into the center of things \u2014 of Africa, of Kurtz, of Marlow, and of human existence \u2014 poses itself as the refutation of such a journey and as the refutation of the general metaphorical conception that meaning may be found within, beneath, at the center. At the end of the search we encounter a darkness, and it is no more defined than at the beginning of the journey and the narration: it continues to exist only as something unapproachable. The unapproachable is, however, tremendously 'significant'.Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad, Penguin Books, Edited with an Introduction by Paul O'Prey, 1989, "]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Paul O'Prey, author, was born in Southampton"]}, {"page": "O'Prey, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul O'Prey"]}]}}
