Although signed after their right-back Richard Hinds broke his leg, it was the quality of his passing in attack that particularly impressed manager Brian Laws about his debut. McMahon was selected in the Championship Team of the Week after his performance against Watford on 13 September, and his loan was extended to the three-month maximum. He was sent off for a bad tackle on Barnsley's Rob Kozluk on 21 October, and was recalled by Middlesbrough to serve the resulting three-match ban with them. He returned to Wednesday on 3 November for the last month of his loan, and in his 15th and final appearance he scored his first senior goal: from an inswinging corner, \"McMahon arrived in the six-yard box in the centre of the goal to power a header\" past Norwich City's goalkeeper to level the scores at 1\u20131 in a match that Wednesday won 3\u20132."]}, {"page": "Dominic Blizzard", "response": ["He made 30 appearances in the 2012\u201313 campaign, though did not feature in the play-off final victory over Brentford which took the \"Glovers\" into the Championship.

On 28 February a high-tackle on Scunthorpe's Richard Hinds resulted in Talbot being sent off. At the end of the season he joined Port Vale on a free transfer, after Mansfield manager Peter Shirtliff made it clear his time at Field Mill was over. Red cards were a common theme of Talbot's time at Vale Park, and he wrote himself into the club's record books with five dismissals in his brief stay. An appeal was made to the FA following his third dismissal, during a 2\u20130 home win over Millwall on 24 March 2007. However manager Martin Foyle admitted \"every time I have gone to the Football Association with an appeal I do not seem to get anything.\" The Millwall match was to prove Talbot's last of the season, though he was retained upon its conclusion. The \"tenacious tackling defender\" was a regular during the 2007\u201308 season, though he fell out the club's first team plans under new manager Lee Sinnott, Talbot knew by January 2008 he had no future at Vale."]}, {"page": "Mark Beevers", "response": ["Beevers gained another chance in the first team on 6 November 2007 in an away game at West Bromwich Albion, who were flying high in the league and the highest scorers in the league. Beevers lined up alongside Richard Hinds in an inexperienced centre back pairing, however Beevers played with the temperament and quality of a player far beyond his years and helped to earn the Owls a 1\u20131 draw."]}, {"page": "Hinds (surname)", "response": ["*Richard Hinds (born 1980), footballer"]}]}}
