The proposal was controversial, as the residents of Fulham wanted their existing hospital to be redeveloped not taken over. A public meeting was set up with the Mayor of Fulham, and the Chairman of the hospital, Lord Inman, explained that the decision was made by the Ministry of Health, and that a new hospital would be well equipped and provide a full service.  This allayed most people's fears, and the new Charing Cross Hospital, located on the site of the former Fulham Hospital, on Fulham Palace Road, was inaugurated by the Queen on 22 May 1973. The cost of building the new hospital was \u00a315m\u2014a staggering amount at the time. Designed by Ralph Tubbs, it consisted of a seventeen-storey building (15 floors for the hospital proper, with two machine floors above that) in the shape of a cross, along with several lower-level buildings. The design was notable for the lack of lifts to meet the capacity required to move patients around in their beds. Porters often waited 1\u20132 hours trying to get patients from wards to X-ray and back. Three high-rise residential blocks were built to house medical staff, nurses and medical students\u2014called Golding, Parsons and Cliff houses, respectively.

In his memoirs, Forman wrote: \"Anyone who witnessed Sidney at work in one of these sessions had to acknowledge his practical genius as an architect\" as Bernstein lectured and demonstrated his plans for the studios to colleagues.
