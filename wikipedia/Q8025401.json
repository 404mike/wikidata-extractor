She is particularly remembered for her performances in the soprano roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas as a member of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company between 1922 and 1932.\nShe started her career as a concert singer. In 1920, she made her operatic debut as Countess Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro, appeared in the first performances of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen in more than 200 years, and created the role of Guinevere in The Round Table. Lawson was soon playing a range of roles, from as Marguerite in Faust to Bessie Throckmorton in Merrie England. She was a D'Oyly Carte principal soprano for nearly a decade, playing 10 of the leading Savoy opera roles. The only other role she played during this time was Lili in Lilac Time, although she also began a broadcast career in 1929 on BBC radio.\nIn the mid-1930s, Lawson appeared for two seasons with the Vic Wells Opera in The Marriage of Figaro (as Susanna), Cos\u00ec fan tutte (Fiordiligi), Don Giovanni (Zerlina), The Magic Flute (Genius), Pagliacci (Nedda), Faust (Marguerite), and La boh\u00e8me. She next toured in Australasia in many of her old Gilbert and Sullivan roles. She retired from opera in 1938 but entertained the troops during the Second World War and continued broadcasting and recording during and after the war.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Iolanthe", "response": ["|Phyllis||Elsie McDermid||Winifred Lawson||Doreen Denny||Helen Roberts||Margaret Mitchell"]}, {"page": "The Yeomen of the Guard", "response": ["|Elsie||Sylvia Cecil||Winifred Lawson||Helen Roberts||Helen Roberts||Muriel Harding"]}, {"page": "The Sorcerer", "response": ["|Aline||Elsie Griffin||Winifred Lawson||Margery Abbott||Julia Goss||Pamela Field"]}, {"page": "Princess Ida", "response": ["|Princess Ida||Winifred Lawson||Helen Roberts||Victoria Sladen||Ann Hood||Valerie Masterson"]}, {"page": "The Gondoliers", "response": ["|Casilda||Sylvia Cecil||Winifred Lawson||Margery Abbott||Margery Abbott||Margaret Mitchell"]}, {"page": "Winifred", "response": ["* Winifred Lawson (1892-1961), an English opera and concert singer"]}, {"page": "Patience (opera)", "response": ["|Patience||Elsie McDermid||Winifred Lawson||Doreen Denny||Margery Abbott"]}, {"page": "J.
