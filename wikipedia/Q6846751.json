Cardinal Healthcare was acquired by InHealth Group in 2002 and the mobile service's management team left to create Vanguard Healthcare. In 2003 it had 6 mobile theatres and two wards in use, and in some cases provided staff as well as buildings.  The company was bought by Nuffield Health in 2004.  In April 2009 it again became an independent company following a management buyout backed by MML Capital Partners.  In 2014 it has 40 mobile surgical units and claims to be the single largest fleet of mobile surgical facilities in the world.  It operates across Europe and in Australia.   Mike Farrar was employed as a Strategic Advisor in March 2014.  The company made an \u201coperating profit\u201d of \u00a31.6m in 2013/4 but the cost servicing loans from MML meant that it paid no corporation tax - and hasn't since 2009."]}]}}
