As the wife and ex-wife of two unfaithful men, she explained her marriage philosophy to the Times in 1987: \"I can never understand the wives who really mind, the wives who set such store by fidelity. How extraordinary, and how mad they are. Because, surely, if the man goes out and he comes back, it's not actually doing any harm.\"", "While still legally married to Birley, she gave birth to Jemima (b. 30 January 1974) and Zac (b. 20 January 1975).
