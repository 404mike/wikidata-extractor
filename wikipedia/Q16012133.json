He left them in 1936 to join English Racing Automobiles (ERA) in Bourne, Lincolnshire as a draughtsman. Also at ERA was Walter Hassan who became a lifelong friend; the two would work together later at Jaguar on engine development.\nHe left ERA in 1939 and returned to Coventry to work at the Morris Engines factory.\nAfter World War II he moved to British Racing Motors (BRM) in 1946 as head of the design office, being involved in the design of the BRM V16 Formula One engine, before moving on again in 1950 to Coventry Climax engines as chief designer working on the FWA engine.\nHis career then took a change in direction and he moved into journalism becoming Technical Editor of The Autocar magazine in 1955 but while there he also worked on the design of the Ford based twin-cam engine for Lotus.However, following Jaguar's purchase of Coventry Climax in 1963, Hassan persuaded Mundy to return to engineering where, with William Heynes, they developed the Jaguar V12 engine.\nHarry Mundy stayed with Jaguar until his retirement in 1980, after which he still did some consultancy work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ford Kent engine", "response": ["Harry Mundy designed the Lotus TwinCam engine for Colin Chapman, who needed the replacement for the Coventry Climax FWE engine used in Lotus Elite.  As Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, the co-founders of Cosworth, used to be Lotus Development Ltd employees, the initial racing adaptation of Lotus TwinCam was carried out by Cosworth, and the Kent block Cosworth SCA was designed using the basic SOHC reverse-flow cylinder head configuration of the FWE.  Due to Mundy being also the co-designer of the FWE, the Kent block Lotus TwinCam initially used the cam profile of the FWE, and shared the same valve clearance adjustment shims with Coventry Climax FWA, FWB, and FWE in production."]}, {"page": "Triumph Dolomite", "response": ["\"A higher-powered development of the slant-four would provide the perfect engine to compete more effectively in motor sport.

Colin Chapman had been wishing to build his own engines for Lotus, mainly because the Coventry Climax unit was so expensive. Colin Chapman's chance came when he commissioned Harry Mundy (a close friend and designer of the Coventry Climax engine and technical editor for Autocar) to design a twin-cam version of the Ford Kent engine. Most of the development of the engine was done on the 997cc and 1,340cc bottom end, but in 1962 Ford released the 116E five bearing 1,498 cc engine and work centred on this. Keith Duckworth, from Cosworth, played an important part in tuning of the engine. The engine's first appearance was in 1962 at the N\u00fcrburgring in a Lotus 23 driven by Jim Clark. Almost as soon as the engine appeared in production cars (Lotus Elan), it was replaced with a larger capacity unit (82.55\u00a0mm bore to give 1,557 cc).

Because this project was a pure racing engine from the beginning, which was in stark contrast to the corporate product history up to FWA, the engine was named FPE for Fire Pump Engine (Eight according to another lore) by the playful minds of Hassan and Mundy.", "By the middle of the 1962 season, Peter Windsor Smith and Walter Hassan were convinced that the only viable route to more power was through higher revs, and the decision was made, partly in light of Harry Mundy's experiences on the 1.5-Litre supercharged BRM V16, to develop a 1.5-Litre flat-16 designated the FWMW.  Design work started in 1963, and a prototype was running on the bench in late 1964 with two flatplane flat-8 cranks end-to-end, shrunk-fit to a central spur gear at 90 degrees phase shift to each other (not a true boxer arrangement, but rather with opposing pistons sharing a crankpin).", "It was about this time when Walter Hassan convinced Harry Mundy, who had left to become the Technical Editor of The Autocar magazine in 1955 (while there he also designed the Lotus-Ford Twin Cam for Colin Chapman), to rejoin the team, which now included the Jaguar engineer, Claude Bailey, who always worked under William Heynes from the days of XK engine development.

This was developed to be, in typical Colin Chapman fashion, the smallest and lightest five-speed transmission possible, also to have a low driveshaft line allowing a low driving position, thus lower centre of mass and air resistance. Chapman also chose a transaxle over the usual gearbox and rear axle layout, as had been used in the first Twelve, as this gave a lower polar moment of inertia. The initial design, the work of Chapman and Harry Mundy, began with the principle of the most compact layout, with the gear cluster arranged in a closely spaced stack, akin to a motorcycle transmission. As the gears shared common axes, and all teeth were cut to the same size, all the pairs of gear had the same number of teeth in total, 44. The stack was only  long overall. This was likely to require sequential gear change, but that was no drawback in a racing car. The gears would also be easily changeable, to suit different circuits. Gears could be used with the same ratio in any position, to suit both hillclimbing or fast circuits, provided that they remained in a monotonic sequence."]}]}}
