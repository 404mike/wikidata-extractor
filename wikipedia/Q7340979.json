He played for Aldershot, Gillingham, Colchester United, Brighton & Hove Albion, Leyton Orient and Stevenage Borough. between 1990 and 1999.Reinelt is best remembered for his goal that preserved Brighton's Football League status, against Hereford United in 1997.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.", "response": ["By the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they had risen from the bottom of the division table and had to play the team directly below them, Hereford United, to retain their position in the league. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender Kerry Mayo scored an own goal in the first half, and it appeared that Brighton's 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from Robbie Reinelt ensured that Brighton retained their league status, based on number of goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over."]}, {"page": "History of Hereford United F.C.", "response": ["The season that followed, 1996\u201397, saw a complete reverse in the club's fortunes. With debts mounting and the club having made a loss of over \u00a3300,000, Turner was forced to sell key players such as White and Richard Wilkins. A terrible run of form when the club went three months without a win meant they were sucked into the relegation dogfight. Brighton & Hove Albion, with their own well documented troubles, had seemed destined for relegation for much of the season. But they climbed above Hereford on the penultimate day of the season, leaving the Bulls 24th and bottom of the entire Football League.  Both teams were level on points, and Hereford had a better goal difference, but the goals scored rule was in effect and Brighton had scored more goals. On 3 May 1997 the two clubs met in a relegation decider at Edgar Street, which was the subject of considerable media interest as one club would relegate the other. Hereford needed a win to survive while Brighton only required a draw thanks to their having scored more goals. A capacity crowd saw Hereford take the lead in the first half through an own goal by Kerry Mayo from Tony Agana's cross. Brighton equalised in the second half against the run of play through Robbie Reinelt, who snapped up the rebound after a shot crashed against the post. In the last minute Hereford had a chance to save themselves but leading scorer Adrian Foster shot weakly at the goalkeeper when one-on-one. The final whistle blew and Hereford were relegated after 25 years in the Football League. Graham Turner subsequently resigned as manager but withdrew his resignation after strong support from the board and supporters. The general belief around the club at the time was that the club were merely 'on loan' to the Conference, but it would prove to be a long road back."]}, {"page": "Steve Brown (footballer, born 1973)", "response": ["He started his career at his home town club Southend United but he was released in May 1993 and moved to their Essex rivals Colchester United, where he became the club's top scorer in the 1993\u201394 season. In March 1995 he moved to Gillingham in a swap with Robbie Reinelt. He did not get to play regularly for the club, however, and in 1995 he moved to Lincoln City where he stayed till 1998. After a brief stay at Macclesfield Town, he moved to Dover Athletic in 1999, helping the club to a 6th-place finish in the Conference."]}, {"page": "List of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. seasons", "response": ["A sixth-place finish in 1990\u201391 qualified Albion for the playoffs; they beat Millwall in the semi-final, then lost 3\u20131 to Notts County in the final. The following season, when the newly formed FA Premier League split from the Football League, the remaining divisions of the Football League were renumbered upwards, and Albion were relegated from the \"old\" to the \"new\" Second Division. Three years later, another relegation took Albion to the bottom tier of the Football League, and financial problems meant the Goldstone Ground would be sold. From October to the penultimate game of the 1996\u201397 season, Albion were bottom of the League, their plight made worse by a two-point deduction for failure to control their protesting supporters, and they went into the last game needing at least a draw at Hereford United to stay in the League and relegate their opponents to the Conference. After falling behind to an own goal, Robbie Reinelt equalised in the second half to secure their League status. The club played two seasons at Gillingham, some  from home, before returning to Brighton to the Withdean Stadium, a municipal athletics track, in 1999. Bobby Zamora's 28 League goals in each of two consecutive seasons helped his team to two successive divisional titles and promotion back to the second tier. Over the next nine seasons Albion suffered two relegations and two promotions, the first via the playoffs in 2004 and the second, as League One champions, coincident with the opening of the club's new stadium at Falmer in 2011. After a season of consolidation, three playoff semi-final defeats and a season spent flirting with relegation, Albion were Championship runners-up in 2016\u201317 and promoted to the Premier League for the first time. After a 15th-place finish in 2017\u201318, they reached the FA Cup semifinal for only the second time in the club's history in 2018\u201319 and narrowly avoided relegation to the Championship."]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Robbie Reinelt", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Reinelt", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Reinelt"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Robbie Reinelt||FW||||Loughton||||5||0|| Gillingham||22 March 1995||Part exchange", "|align=\"left\"|Robbie Reinelt"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Robbie Reinelt||FW||||Loughton||||0||0|| Gillingham||22 March 1995||Part exchange", "|Robbie Reinelt", "|Part exchange with Robbie Reinelt", "|Robbie Reinelt"]}, {"page": "Reinelt", "response": ["*Robbie Reinelt (born 1974), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["As a Third Division team, Gillingham entered the 1993\u201394 Football League Cup in the first round and were paired with Brighton & Hove Albion of the Second Division.

His first game in charge resulted in a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Walsall.  Following this game, however, Gillingham did not lose for five games, their longest unbeaten run of the season.  The sequence began with a 0\u20130 draw away to Scarborough, only the second time in the last eight away games that Gillingham had not lost, and continued with a 2\u20132 draw at home to Scunthorpe United.  Gillingham then won 3\u20130 at home to Exeter City, another team struggling near the foot of the division, before achieving draws away to Preston North End and at home to Bury.  In the game at Preston, defender Joe Dunne scored his only goal in over 130 games played for Gillingham between 1990 and 1996.  Steve Brown, newly signed from Colchester United in a player exchange deal also involving Robbie Reinelt, made his debut against Bury in place of Pike and scored Gillingham's goal; Brown would start every game for the remainder of the season, paired with either Foster or Pike.  The unbeaten run ended with a defeat away to Carlisle United, which was followed three days later by another at home to Colchester."]}]}}
