At that meeting, Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate stressed GIP's preference for increasing the existing runway's capacity and confirmed GIP's plans to request an increase in the current limit on the permitted number of take-offs and landings.Dixon, A., Second runway plans to remain grounded, Skyport, Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 26 February 2010, pp. 1, 3 However, in 2012, Gatwick's new owners reversed their initial lack of interest in building a second runway at the airport for the foreseeable future. On 3 December 2012, chief executive Stewart Wingate argued in front of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee that allowing Gatwick to add a second runway to relieve the growing airport capacity shortage in the South East of England once the agreement with West Sussex County Council preventing it from doing so had expired in 2019 served the interests of the 12\u00a0million people living in its catchment area better than building a third runway at Heathrow or a new four-runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary. In support of his argument, Wingate stated that expanding Heathrow or building a new hub in the Thames Estuary was more environmentally damaging, more expensive, less practical and risked negating the benefits of ending common ownership of Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted by the erstwhile BAA. Wingate contrasted this with the greater range of flights and improved connectivity including to hitherto un-/underserved emerging markets that would result from a second runway at Gatwick by the mid-2020s as this would enable it to compete with Heathrow on an equal footing to increase consumer choice and reduce fares. In this context, Wingate also accused his counterpart at Heathrow, Colin Matthews, of overstating the importance of transfer traffic by pointing to research by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).entitled PaxIS and AirportIS data products This counts the number of air travel bookings made by passengers passing through the IATA-designated London area airportsHeathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, City and shows that only 7% of these passengers actually change flights there. Wingate believes this to be a more accurate measure of the share of passengers accounted for by transfer traffic at these airports than the more widely used alternative based on survey data collated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA survey data relies on the number of passengers changing flights at these airports as reported by the airlines to the airport authorities and shows that fewer than 20% of all passengers actually change flights there.Heathrow: 24\u00a0million transfer passengers (35%) of 69\u00a0million passengers in 2011; Gatwick: 2.4\u00a0million transfer passengers (7%) of 34\u00a0million passengers in 2011; Stansted: insignificant number of transfer passengers (0%) of 18\u00a0million passengers in 2011; Luton: insignificant number of transfer passengers (0%) of 9.5\u00a0million passengers in 2011; City: 0.06\u00a0million transfer passengers (2%) of 3\u00a0million passengers in 2011"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2014", "response": ["*Sir David Rowlands, 66, British civil servant.Water UK pays tribute to chairman"]}, {"page": "Knights and Dames Commander of the Order of the Bath appointed by Elizabeth II (since 2003)", "response": ["|David Rowlands, CB"]}, {"page": "History of High Speed 2", "response": ["In January 2009 the UK government announced the creation of High Speed Two (HS2) Limited (HS2 Ltd)..
