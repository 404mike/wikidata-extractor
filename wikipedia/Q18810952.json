He was educated at the parish school at Staunton Harold and then at a school kept by a clergyman, who brought him to the notice of Francis Rawdon-Hastings. Lord Rawdon sent young Shakespeare to London to study Arabic under John Richardson. From 1805 to 1809 Shakespear held an orientalist professorship at the Royal Military College, Marlow. In 1809 he was appointed professor of Hindustani at Addiscombe Military Seminary and held the professorship until his retirement in 1829 with a pension of \u00a3300 per annum.Shakespear's A Hindustani Grammar (1813) was published as a condensed grammar to replace John B. Gilchrist's A Grammar of Hindoostanee Language (1796), which had gone out of print.In retirement he bought Langley Priory in Leicestershire. Believing that he might be descended from a branch of William Shakespeare's family, John Shakespear in 1856 gave \u00a32,500 to the trustees of the fund for preserving Shakespeare's Birthplace at Stratford-upon-Avon. He died unmarried in 1858 and his estate was inherited by his nephew, Charles Bowles, who took the surname Shakespear.In 1835 H. P. Briggs painted Shakespear's portrait, which was at Langley Priory for many years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shakespear", "response": ["* John Shakespear (1774\u20131858), English orientalist", "* John Shakespear (British Army officer) (1861\u20131942), British Army officer in India"]}, {"page": "Shah (surname)", "response": ["The term \"sahukari\" means the profession of banking/trading, and is derived from Sahu (Sanskrit \"Sadhu\") and kar (Sanskrit for doer).John Shakespear.

In the 1850s photography was also studied. J. M. Bourne concludes that the Seminary was \"not a true military college at all, but a militarised public school\"although he also judges that, by the standards of the age, its record as a military training school was not significantly worse than those of the establishments at Woolwich and Sandhurst.Bourne 1979, p. 222.", "* John Shakespear, Professor of Hindustani, 1809\u201329"]}, {"page": "Shakespear, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Shakespear"]}]}}
