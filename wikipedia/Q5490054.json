Despite prior assurances to the contrary, he was turned down for an apprenticeship at the age of 16, only for Aston Villa to change their mind after his mother rang manager Vic Crowe to complain. The under-18 team, coached by Frank Upton, were a strong side and won tournaments in Germany, Zambia and Holland. However Ron Saunders succeeded Crowe as first-team manager and would sell or release all of the youth-team players and sign new players; in his autobiography Hunt wrote that \"Saunders had huge flaws\" and \"lacked empathy\". Hunt damaged cartilage in his knee during his debut for the reserve team and blamed the injury on Saunders' intense fitness regime."]}]}}
