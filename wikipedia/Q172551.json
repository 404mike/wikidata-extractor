He built a number of front wheel drive 500cc Formula 3 cars named Emeryson and drove them himself. He participated in two World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 14 July 1956 and numerous non-Championship Formula One races.

When the Formula One regulation changed to 3\u00a0Litres for 1966, Mr. Getley permitted Paul Emery to rebuild one FPE to 3\u00a0Litre format and fit it into a one-off Shannon steel monocoque chassis to make the Shannon F1 car named SH1 driven by Trevor Taylor at 1966 British Grand Prix.  Bored out to 3\u00a0Litres and Tecalemit Jackson fuel injection installed, this Emery-built FPE produced 312\u00a0bhp on the dynamometer at Chrysler's Kew facility.", "As a result, Coventry Climax could not derive revenues from the project, and was further forced to develop a 2-Litre version of FWMV so that Lotus, who built one Lotus 33 chassis specifically for FWMW, and were counting on using FWMW's anticipated 3-Litre successor, could avoid missing the first races of the 1966 season.  Neither the old 4 cylinder FPF nor the 8 cylinder FWMV could be enlarged to 3\u00a0Litres, and the 11 years old 2.5-Litre FPE parts had been sold off in their entirety and were in the hands of Paul Emery, who was in the process of enlarging FPE to 3-Litres as described in the above FPE section."]}, {"page": "1956 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Paul Emery", "|  Paul Emery"]}, {"page": "1958 Monaco Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Paul Emery", "|  Paul Emery"]}, {"page": "1959 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Connaught Cars-Paul Emery"]}, {"page": "1958 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Paul Emery", "|align=\"left\"|  Paul Emery"]}, {"page": "1956 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Paul Emery", "|align=\"left\"|  Paul Emery"]}, {"page": "Trevor Taylor (racing driver)", "response": ["!
