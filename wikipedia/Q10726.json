A move to Stoke City in 2000 saw him sent out on loan to several teams before a short-lived spell with 2. Fu\u00dfball-Bundesliga side Alemannia Aachen. After moving to the Football League Championship with Colchester United and then Charlton Athletic, he signed for Wolves in 2008 as they won promotion to the Premier League, winning Player of the Month in November 2008.\nIwelumo's father is Nigerian and his mother is Scottish. He won his first cap as a full Scottish international coming on as a substitute against Norway in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier in 2008, notable for his missing an open goal from only yards out as the match finished 0\u20130 an event which Iwelumo has said \"tortured\" him.

Charlton's form, however, quickly deteriorated and they were near the foot of the table after eight games without a win. After a 5\u20132 home defeat to Sheffield United, hundreds of supporters remained for more than an hour to condemn their manager, chanting, \"We want Pardew out\" and \"We want our club back\" after Charlton had slipped into the Championship's bottom three.
