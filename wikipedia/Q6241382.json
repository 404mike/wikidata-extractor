By summer 1714 the debate on The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity had ramified, and provoked a formal complaint from the Lower House of Convocation: the Blasphemy Act 1697 still made it an offence for \"any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the Holy Trinity\". Clarke drew up an apologetic preface, and then gave explanations which satisfied the Upper House of Convocation. He had strong supporters among the bishops. Clarke promised not to preach or write on the topic. Arthur Ashley Sykes and John Jackson from then on acted as his proxies. Other main participants in the controversy were John Edwards, Francis Gastrell, James Knight who published with Bull's biographer Robert Nelson, Richard Mayo of Great Kimble (son of the nonconformist Richard Mayo), Stephen Nye, Edward Welchman and Edward Wells."]}, {"page": "Conyers Middleton", "response": ["The years 1747\u20138 produced Middleton's most significant theological writings.

In the European view, Islam lacked divine authority and regarded the sword as the route to heaven.

Many contemporary works about Islam were available to influence Hume's opinions by authors such as Isaac Barrow, Humphrey Prideaux, John Jackson, Charles Wolseley, Hugo Grotius, Paul Rycaut, Thomas Hyde, Pierre Bayle, and Blaise Pascal. The writers of this period were also influenced by George Sale who, in 1743, had translated the Quran into English."]}, {"page": "Anthony Bliss", "response": ["* Remarks on the plea, and the defence of the plea, for human reason (1733): a reply to John Jackson's A Plea for Humane Reason and A Defense of the Plea for Human Reason: Being a Reply to a Book Entitled, A Plea for Divine Retribution"]}, {"page": "William Dudgeon (philosopher)", "response": ["Among Dudgeon's other major works is 'Philosophical Letters' (1737), written to John Jackson (controversialist), another prominent defender of Clarke's philosophy.

After Carte's death, John Nichols used his work extensively for his History of Leicestershire (1795-1811). Carte's most important publication was antiquarian in nature: Tabula Chronologica Archiepiscopatuum et Episcopatuum in Anglia et Wallia [Chronological table of Archbishoprics and Bishoprics in England and Wales] (1714), a compilation of lists on the descent of the offices of archbishops and bishops.
