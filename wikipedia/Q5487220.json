He was an early member of the Labour Party, and wrote The Coming Force, a history of the party.At the 1906 UK general election, Rose stood unsuccessfully in Stockton, and then at the January 1910 UK general election he was unsuccessful in Crewe.  He was finally elected in Aberdeen North at the 1918 UK general election, and held the seat until his death, in 1928.  He was known for frequently defying the Labour whip, and so was sometimes considered to be an independent labour MP, despite his membership of the party.", "link_mentions": {}}}
