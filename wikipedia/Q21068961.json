He was educated at St. Peter's College, and in Brighton, England. He joined his father's firm in 1867, and took it over in 1871, with Colonel J. Chapman Lovely (c. 1837 \u2013 11 November 1915) as partner, when his father retired. In 1879, supported by the Rymill brothers and several other businessmen, he established a new stock exchange (one of two competing schemes), on land known as \"King's timber yard\" in Pirie Street; they hired Edmund W. Wright to design, and Charles Farr to erect, the new building.Green was a director of many notable companies: the South Australian Gas Company, the South Australian Brewing Company, John Hill & Co., the Metropolitan Brick Company, and the Glenelg Railway Company.
