A member of the Conservative Party, Bailey has been a member of the London Assembly since 2016.\nBorn in North Kensington to a British Jamaican family, Bailey earned a degree in computer-aided engineering from London South Bank University. In 2006, he co-founded a charity called MyGeneration; it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial problems. Bailey was a researcher for the Centre for Policy Studies and wrote several articles in the British press. He was appointed a special adviser on youth and crime to David Cameron from 2010 to 2013. He also stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith in 2010 and Lewisham West and Penge in 2017.\nIn 2018, Bailey was selected as the Conservative candidate in the 2021 London mayoral election (initially scheduled for 2020, but postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic). Bailey came second in the election, losing to Sadiq Khan in the second-preference count, having received 35% of first-preference and 45% of second-preference votes.\nIn December 2021, Bailey resigned from his position as chair of the London Assembly's police and crime committee after a photo emerged of him attending a Christmas party in contravention of tier 2 coronavirus restrictions which were in place in the UK at the time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of London Assembly constituencies", "response": ["|rowspan=\"1\"| Con(Shaun Bailey)", "|rowspan=\"1\"| Con(Shaun Bailey)", "|rowspan=\"4\"| Shaun Bailey(Con)"]}, {"page": "London South Bank University", "response": ["* Shaun Bailey, politician"]}, {"page": "Greg Hands", "response": ["In 2007, Hands was selected to be the Conservative candidate for the new Chelsea and Fulham parliamentary constituency.

In January 2009, Hands was appointed to the Conservative front bench team as a shadow Treasury minister.

Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics. The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \"made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest\". Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event. Also unlike the case for H1N1 \"swine flu\" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020. In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate. In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19."]}, {"page": "Rory Stewart", "response": ["In October 2019, Stewart announced that he was to stand as an independent in the upcoming London mayoral election against incumbent Labour mayor Sadiq Khan and Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey. He planned during his candidacy to walk through each of the 32 London boroughs. In November 2019, he appeared on BBC One's Have I Got News for You.  Labelled by Scottish newspaper, The National, a \"bizarre campaign trick\", in February 2020, as a part of his campaign, he sought invitations from \"Londoners to invite him into their homes and let him stay the night\".  The objective, he tweeted was for them to \"show me the city through their eyes. I want to know your concerns and your ideas.\"  By 14 February, The Guardian tweeted, \"2,000 Londoners [had taken] up Rory Stewart's offer\"."]}, {"page": "Hinduism in the United Kingdom", "response": ["In October 2018, it was reported that Conservative Party (UK) London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey had written a pamphlet, entitled No Man\u2019s Land, for the Centre for Policy Studies. In it, Bailey argued that accommodating Hindus \"[robs] Britain of its community\" and is turning the country into a \"crime riddled cess pool\". He also claimed that South Asians \"bring their culture, their country and any problems they might have, with them\" and that this was not a problem within the black community \"because we\u2019ve shared a religion and in many cases a language\". In the pamphlet, Bailey had confused the Hindu religion and the Hindi language: \"You don\u2019t know what to do. You bring your children to school and they learn far more about Diwali than Christmas. I speak to the people who are from Brent and they\u2019ve been having Hindi (sic) days off.\" The Conservative Party Deputy Chairman, James Cleverly, defended Bailey and insisted he was misunderstood, and that he was implying black boys were drifting into crime as a result of learning more about Hinduism rather than \"their own Christian culture\". However, the anti-racism Hope Not Hate campaign group called Bailey's comments \"grotesque\". The comments were condemned by the Hindu Council of the United Kingdom who expressed \"disappointment at the misrepresentation of our faith\" by Bailey."]}, {"page": "Anti-Hindu sentiment", "response": ["==== Shaun Bailey ====", "In October 2018, it was reported that Conservative Party candidate for the Mayor of London Shaun Bailey had written a pamphlet, entitled No Man\u2019s Land, for the Centre for Policy Studies.
