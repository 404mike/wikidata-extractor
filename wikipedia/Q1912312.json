Subsequently he was selected by the national coaches as the new synchro partner for British and European champion Tom Daley, who had not been able to compete in the synchro at the national championships after his previous partner Blake Aldridge was beaten up in a nightclub. Brick is only two years older than Daley, compared with the twelve-year age gap between Daley and Aldridge.\nDaley and Brick came fifth on their debut as the 2009 FINA World Series event in Sheffield, and picked up a silver medal at the FINA Diving Grand Prix in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in their second outing.\nIn 2010, Brick also dived with Peter Waterfield, as the national selectors experimented to find the best pair.

He represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics where he was Britain's youngest competitor, age fourteen, and the youngest from any nation to participate in a final. In 2009, Daley reached a career-best ranking of number one in the FINA World Aquatics Championships Diving Rankings for the 10m platform. He won two gold medals for England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, in the 10m synchro diving (with Max Brick) and the 10m Individual Platform competition.", "During the Olympics Daley had a row with diving partner Blake Aldridge when the latter phoned his mother between rounds. When Aldridge missed the British Championships because of the injury sustained in the nightclub incident, Daley's father said he'd like his son to have a different diving partner. In April 2009 he started to dive with Max Brick, who is two years his senior, compared with the twelve-year gap with Aldridge. The pair achieved a silver medal in the 10m synchronized event at Fort Lauderdale on 8 May 2009. Daley won the individual event in a new personal best of 554.90, scoring a perfect set of seven 10s for one of his dives.", "On 12 October 2010, Daley attended the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, India.
