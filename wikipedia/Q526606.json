In addition, he contributed 57 biographies of botanists. He contributed seven volumes to the major botanical publication of the eighteenth century, Flora Graeca, the publications begun by John Sibthorp. A fruitful collaboration was found through descriptions Smith supplied to publisher and illustrator, James Sowerby with whom he subsequently developed as passionate interest in mosses and lichens. Depiction of flora in England had previously only found patronage for aesthetic concerns, but an interest in gardening and natural history saw illustrated publications, such as the exotic A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland and James Sowerby's 36-volume English Botany, reach new audiences."]}, {"page": "William Wood", "response": ["William Wood may refer to:", "* William Wood (MP for Berkshire), Member of Parliament (MP) for Berkshire, 1395", "* William Wood (15th century MP), MP for Winchester, 1413", "* William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley (1801\u20131881), British statesman", "* William Wood (MP for Pontefract) (1816\u20131872), British MP for Pontefract", "* William Wood (New Zealand politician) (1827\u20131884), New Zealand politician from Invercargill & Mataura", "* William Wood (Australian politician) (1869\u20131953)", "* William Wood (Texas politician), member of the Twentieth Texas Legislature", "* William Wood (wrestler) (1888\u2013?), British wrestler", "* William Wood (rower) (1899\u20131969), Canadian rower and Olympic silver medalist", "* William Wood (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u2013?), English football player for Aberdare Athletic and Stoke", "* William Wood (footballer, born 1910) (1910\u2013?), English football defender", "* William Wood (footballer, born 1904), footballer, played for Manchester City, Newcastle United and Rochdale between 1926 and 1928.", "* William Wood (athlete) (1881\u20131940), Canadian track and field athlete", "* William Wood (cricketer) (1849\u20131924), Australian cricketer", "* William Wood (diver), English diver", "* William Wood (ironmaster) (1671\u20131730), British ironmaster, best known for a notorious issue of Irish coins and the 'Rosa Americana' British America coins", "* William Wood (botanist) (1745\u20131808), English Unitarian clergyman, botanist and activist", "* William Wood (zoologist) (1774\u20131857), English entomologist", "* William Wood (historian) (1864\u20131947), Canadian historian", "* William Wood (trade unionist) (1872/73\u20131956), British trade union leader", "* William Wood (Scottish surgeon) (1782\u20131858)", "* William Wood (screenwriter), writer of films such as Death Car on the Freeway", "* William Wood (ventriloquist), illusionist and ventriloquist", "* William Wood (banker), Scottish-American banker", "* William Woods (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Collingtree", "response": ["* William Wood the Botanist was born in the village in 1745.Wykes, C.
