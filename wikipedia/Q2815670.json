He was affiliated with the  University of Cambridge, England and the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Boardman was most widely known for his construction of the first rigorously correct model of the homotopy category of spectra.\nHe received his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1964.  His thesis advisor was C. T. C. Wall. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He died on 18 March 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spectrum (topology)", "response": ["A version of the concept of a spectrum was introduced in the 1958 doctoral dissertation of Elon Lages Lima. His advisor Edwin Spanier wrote further on the subject in 1959. Spectra were adopted by Michael Atiyah and George W. Whitehead in their work on generalized homology theories in the early 1960s.  The 1964 doctoral thesis of J. Michael Boardman gave a workable definition of a category of spectra and of maps (not just homotopy classes) between them, as useful in stable homotopy theory as the category of CW complexes is in the unstable case.  (This is essentially the category described above, and it is still used for many purposes: for other accounts, see Adams (1974) or Rainer Vogt (1970).)    Important further theoretical advances have however been made since 1990, improving vastly the formal properties of spectra.  Consequently, much recent literature uses modified definitions of spectrum: see Michael Mandell et al. (2001) for a unified treatment of these new approaches."]}, {"page": "Operad", "response": ["Operads originate in algebraic topology from the study of iterated loop spaces by J. Michael Boardman and Rainer M. Vogt, and J. Peter May. The word \"operad\" was created by May as a portmanteau of \"operations\" and \"monad\" (and also because his mother was an opera singer). Interest in operads was considerably renewed in the early 90s when, based on early insights of Maxim Kontsevich, Victor Ginzburg and Mikhail Kapranov discovered that some duality phenomena in rational homotopy theory could be explained using Koszul duality of operads. Operads have since found many applications, such as in deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds, the Deligne conjecture, or graph homology in the work of Maxim Kontsevich and Thomas Willwacher."]}, {"page": "Timeline of category theory and related mathematics", "response": ["Segal categories were defined one year later implicitly by Graeme Segal. They were named Segal categories first by William Dwyer\u2013Daniel Kan\u2013Jeffrey Smith 1989. In their famous book Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces, J.
