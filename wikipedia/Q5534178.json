In a twelve-year career in the Football League he played 507 league and cup games, scoring 40 goals.\nHe turned professional at Manchester United at the age of 17, then switched to Crewe Alexandra in 1979. He spent two seasons at Crewe, making 87 league appearances and winning a Player of the Year award, before he went to Port Vale for a \u00a315,000 fee in August 1981. He helped the club to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1982\u201383, and was also named in the PFA Team of the Year. He helped the club to promotion out of the fourth tier again in 1985\u201386. After 221 league appearances for the \"Valiants\", he was allowed to sign with Wrexham in May 1987. He spent four years with the Welsh club, playing 122 league games, before he retired in 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["He built for the 1981\u201382 season by signing defender Ray Deakin from Everton; midfielder Geoff Hunter from Crewe Alexandra for \u00a312,000; and forwards Ernie Moss from Chesterfield for \u00a312,000 and Jimmy Greenhoff from the Toronto Blizzard. They lost just one of their opening eight games, before their form suffered due to an injury crisis. In mid-season Vale went fifteen games unbeaten, before another bought of injuries caused their promotion campaign to wither into a seventh-place finish. Having drawn 12 home games, McGrath said \"we blew it at Burslem\". He did though manage to blood young striker Mark Bright and the following season handed Robbie Earle his debut, both of whom would become top-flight footballers."]}, {"page": "Terry Armstrong", "response": ["Armstrong made 17 appearances for the \"Valiants\" at the end of the 1980\u201381 campaign, and claimed goals against Hereford United and Peterborough United. He featured 42 times in the 1981\u201382 season, scoring goals against Hartlepool United and Lincoln City. He scored seven goals in 45 games in the 1982\u201383 promotion campaign, including a brace in a 4\u20131 win over Mansfield Town at Vale Park. However he and numerous other players fell out with manager John McGrath over player wages, and as a result Armstrong, Barry Siddall, Russell Bromage, and Geoff Hunter all remained on weekly contracts. Armstrong hit two goals in 21 matches in the 1983\u201384 season as Vale were relegated out of the Third Division, despite an upturn in form under new boss John Rudge. Armstrong began to be plagued by a nagging knee injury, which required a cartilage operation. His injury kept him limited to just six appearances in the 1984\u201385 campaign, and he left the club on a free transfer to non-league Nuneaton Borough in May 1985, later moving on to Alliance Premier League rivals Northwich Victoria."]}, {"page": "Russell Bromage", "response": ["He made another 54 appearances in 1981\u201382, before he helped the \"Valiants\" to promotion in 1982\u201383 with 2 goals in 49 games.

He served as club captain and was rated as an excellent captain by teammate Robbie Earle.", "However he refused to sign a new contract for the 1983\u201384 season, as did teammates Geoff Hunter, Barry Siddall, and Terry Armstrong. He eventually walked out on the club, and played two Second Division games for Oldham Athletic in October. However he returned to Vale Park in November, and agreed to sign a new contract.

McGrath pointed out that 'forwards are much more important now' as the Football League changed the system so that wins were rewarded with three points instead of two. For the first time in a decade, the club made it into the second round of the League Cup. Colin Tartt was re-signed from Chesterfield for \u00a315,000 as the club made a push for promotion. Injury problems eventually made promotion unattainable, though 70 points and a 7th-place finish gave cause for optimism, despite a club record low attendance for a league game of 1,924 in a goalless draw with York City on 1 May. Twelve home draws resulted in McGrath's observation that 'we blew it at Burslem'.

After recovering he became a first team regular in the 1985\u201386 Fourth Division promotion side, scoring three goals in 44 games, playing in a five-man midfield with Oshor Williams, Geoff Hunter, Robbie Earle, and Paul Maguire. Bowden remained a regular in John Rudge's first team plans in the Third Division, scoring four goals in 42 matches in 1986\u201387.
