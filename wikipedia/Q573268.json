He was born in Brighton, England.  French was a graduate of Cambridge University, receiving his B.A. in 1942 and Ph.D. in 1948, both in physics.  In 1942, he began working on the British effort to build an atomic bomb (codenamed Tube Alloys) at the Cavendish Laboratory.  By 1944, Tube Alloys had been merged with the American Manhattan Project and he was sent to Los Alamos.\nWhen the war ended, he returned to the United Kingdom, where he spent a couple of years at the newly formed Atomic Energy Research Establishment.  He later joined the faculty at Cambridge, where he conducted his research at Cavendish and became a Fellow and Director of Studies in Natural Sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge.  In 1955, French arrived at the University of South Carolina, where he was made chairman of the physics department.  He left South Carolina in 1962 to take a faculty position in the MIT Physics Department, where he remained until his death.  French's main interest was undergraduate physics education.  He was chairman of the Commission on Physics Education of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (1975-1981) and president of the American Association of Physics Teachers (1985-1986).  He was also a Fellow of the American Physical Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cavendish Laboratory", "response": ["In World War II the laboratory carried out research for the MAUD Committee, part of the British Tube Alloys project of research into the atomic bomb.

Peierls arrived from New York on 8 February 1944, and subsequently succeeded Chadwick as head of the British Mission at Los Alamos. Egon Bretscher worked in Teller's Super group, as did Anthony French, who later recalled that \"never at any time did I have anything to do with the fission bomb once I went to Los Alamos.\" Four members of the British Mission became group leaders: Bretscher (Super Experimentation), Frisch (Critical Assemblies and Nuclear Specifications), Peierls (Implosion Hydrodynamics) and George Placzek (Composite Weapon).Members of the British mission to Los Alamos were: Aage Bohr (Denmark), Niels Bohr (Denmark), Egon Bretscher, James Chadwick, Lord Cherwell, Boris Davidson.
