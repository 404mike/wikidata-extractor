His own performances did not equal those of 1922, but nor did they fall much short: he made at least 500 runs in each season and his season average only once dipped below 15 runs per innings. His only century for Leicestershire was an innings of 104 in the match against Northamptonshire in 1923. In that match and in others until the emergence of Eddie Dawson, Berry and Shipman as regular opening batsmen, Fowke opened the innings, but later he dropped down the batting order to No 6 or No 7, and sometimes even lower. He missed a few matches in 1926 through a leg strain, but otherwise maintained fitness through to the end of the 1927 season, when he played in 29 first-class matches, more than in any other season, and then retired."]}, {"page": "Tommy Codd", "response": ["9 months after the outbreak of the First World War, Codd enlisted in the Football Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment in May 1915.

Codd lost the eye and later served in the Army Service Corps before his discharge from the army in June 1918."]}]}}
