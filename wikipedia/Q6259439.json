His early life in Edwardian England continued to inspire his work.  He would regularly use his wife and daughters as models for his paintings.   His first one-man show in 1947 featured \"The Three Princesses\" which depicted his daughters Josephine, Victoria and Virginia.  In the 1960s he became particularly known for his oil paintings of children and flowers and was a successful portrait artist. Many of his  paintings of children and flowers, were made into prints.After his first wife's death he married Julia Marzo a Barcelona native and had a daughter, Bridget.\nTwenty years after his death two of his paintings were donated by his daughter to his local hospital, St Margaret's in Epping, Essex; Strevens had been treated there for Parkinson's disease in later life.
