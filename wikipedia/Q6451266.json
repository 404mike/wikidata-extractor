After an initial prognosis of three months out, a scan suggested he could return to action within a month. He was back in the team for the visit to Scunthorpe United on 5 September, and produced a man-of-the-match performance that earned him a place in the Football League's Team of the Week as Blackpool won their first match of the season.

This run coincided with the return of Kyle Letheren in between the sticks in place of Matt Macey. An injury to Letheren and a stop\u2013start March followed with Argyle winning late on against Shrewsbury Town at home, before giving away a 2\u20131 and then a 2\u20130 lead to Bristol Rovers and then Blackpool in the dying minutes to draw both matches.
