He became a medical student but was interested in local history and archaeology. In 1900 he was married to Anna Elanor Austin. They lived at Dymboro, a house in Midsomer Norton built for them as a wedding present from Anna's father, and had six children.In his twenties he heard about the discovery of lake villages in Switzerland and suspected that similar Iron or Bronze Age settlements may exist on the Somerset Levels. He spent his summers searching for them and in 1892 identified a promising field at Godney and began to excavate it. He gave up his medical studies to concentrate on the site which became known as Glastonbury Lake Village, digging during the summer and describing and cataloging his finds during the winter.  In 1898 he stopped the excavation and completed his medical studies before restarting the dig in 1904 with Harold St George Gray.He later went on to excavate, with Gray, another similar site the Meare Lake Village. His work is commemorated in the Glastonbury Lake Village Museum at The Tribunal, Glastonbury.Bulleid died in 1951 and is buried in the cemetery, Wells Road, Glastonbury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset Levels", "response": ["The Levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the UK, Glastonbury Lake Village, as well as two others at Meare Lake Village.

Artefacts uncovered include wooden and metal objects, many of which are now on display at The Tribunal in Glastonbury High Street, and in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. Much of the timber was left at the site and soil put back on top of it as the best way to preserve it. Surveys in the late 20th and early 21st century have shown this to be effective, however the site is still at risk because of the risk of further drying out of the soil.", "The lake village, a crannog or man made island, was discovered in 1892 by local medical student Arthur Bulleid, whose father was a local mayor and the founder of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. Bulleid had heard about the lake villages in Switzerland and believed similar sites could be found in his native Somerset."]}, {"page": "The Tribunal, Glastonbury", "response": ["The exhibits include the metal \"Glastonbury Bowl\". It was made from two sections riveted together and repaired several times over its life. The bottom half has been dated as having been constructed in the Iron Age. The upper half was probably added in the 1st century from one sheet of metal, which may have been previously used for another purpose, and the two halves riveted together. Other artefacts that form the village include a clay tuy\u00e8re from a pair of bellows, whetstones, iron knives and iron currency bars, which could be used as tokens and exchanged for goods. The glazed jar on display is a 1936 copy of one from the village site; however some of the original storage bowls are included in the displays which were re assembled by Arthur Bulleid, who discovered the site in 1892.
