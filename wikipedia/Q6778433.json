A chance to make amends came three days later with another home match, this time against former Conference rivals Aldershot.  However, with midfielder Damon Lathrope leaving the field injured after only 14 minutes on his first League start, Torquay could not find a way past a resolute Shots defence and were eventually sunk by a Marvin Morgan goal in the 86th minute."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Aldershot Town F.C. season", "response": ["August: The season started brightly as the Shots went unbeaten in the league throughout August.

The team also progressed to the second round of the League Trophy, winning 2\u20130 at home to Oxford United with goals from Danny Hylton and Damian Spencer.

Dillon responded by urging fans to be \"realistic\", while goalkeeper Jamie Young called for fans to get behind the team. The club's woes were compounded by striker Marvin Morgan sparking controversy over his comments on social networking site Twitter, resulting in the player being transfer-listed and quickly moved out on loan to Dagenham & Redbridge. A fourth straight home reverse to Oxford followed, and proved to be Dillon's last game as manager, as he and assistant Gary Owers left by mutual consent on 10 January, the club citing the team's poor league performance as a major contributing factor in the decision. A successor was not long in arriving, as the club officially named Newport County's Dean Holdsworth as new Aldershot manager just two days later. Holdsworth wasted no time making his mark on the team, bringing in forwards Peter Vincenti, Tim Sills, and Alex Rodman - as well as defender Simon Grand on loan from Fleetwood - before the end of the month. There were also players leaving the club during this period of transition, with both Glen Little and Wesley Ngo Baheng being released, whilst Anthony Straker and Damian Spencer were sent out on loan. Holdsworth's first game in charge resulted in a creditable 1\u20131 draw away to high-flying Bury, and he also improved on Aldershot's poor home form; Winning his first game at The Rec 1\u20130 against Bradford City, whilst a last-minute Luke Guttridge free-kick gave the Shots a second consecutive home win 3\u20132 against Crewe.
