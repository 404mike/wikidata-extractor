The discovery of the fraud began with Talent and John Pickett, who visited a road cut site in Nepal where Gupta had reported prolific numbers of Devonian conodont fossils. They found no fossils at nearly all the twenty sites he had mentioned but they found one site which yielded a fossil of a Silurian age. They subsequently chanced on his use of the same image in two papers and initially considered the possibility of error by adding the wrong photograph. A more detailed examination showed them that Gupta had used illustrations of fossils that were similar to specimens collected near New York by George Jennings Hinde in 1879. They interviewed coauthors, talked to Gupta on several occasions and made a detailed accusation on the willful nature and scale of fraud after nine years of research. Gupta attempted to respond to the claims by noting the credentials of his coworkers."]}]}}
