He is often known as \u201cThe last of the Post Impressionists\" and was one of the great artists of his generation. His mediums included oils, watercolours and pastels and his paintings include French maritime scenes, busy New York City scenes and the English countryside. He is especially noted for his quintessentially English themes: regattas, sporting events and ceremonial celebrations, such as racing at Goodwood, Henley Regatta, Trooping the Colour and yachting at Cowes.\nDuring the First World War, Maze met Winston Churchill in the trenches and their shared love of painting led to a lifelong friendship. Maze became Churchill's artistic mentor, encouraging him to develop his drawing and painting techniques.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1979 in art", "response": ["* September 17 \u2013 Paul Maze, French-born English Post-Impressionist painter (born 1887)"]}, {"page": "1887 in art", "response": ["** Paul Maze, French-born Post-Impressionist painter (died 1979)."]}, {"page": "Lord Ivor Spencer-Churchill", "response": ["*Robert William Charles Spencer-Churchill (born 1954), who in 1979 married Jeanne M.

Lady Spencer-Churchill had previously destroyed earlier portraits of her husband that she disliked, including sketches by Walter Sickert and Paul Maze. She had hidden the Sutherland portrait in the cellars at Chartwell and employed her private secretary Grace Hamblin and Hamblin's brother to remove it in the middle of the night and burn it in a remote location. Many commentators were aghast at the destruction of the work of art, and Sutherland condemned it as an act of vandalism; others upheld the Churchills' right to dispose of their property as they saw fit."]}, {"page": "Winston Churchill as painter", "response": ["He received direction and encouragement from several professional artists, including his London neighbour Sir John Lavery, and later also Walter Sickert, William Nicholson and Paul Maze.
