A famous problem of economic theory, the conditions under which money, which is intrinsically worthless, can have a positive value in a general equilibrium, is called \"Hahn's problem\" after him. One of Hahn's main abiding concerns was the understanding of Keynesian (Non-Walrasian) outcomes in general equilibrium situations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 26", "response": ["*  1925   \u2013 Frank Hahn, British economist (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "General equilibrium theory", "response": ["Although the Arrow\u2013Debreu\u2013McKenzie model is set out in terms of some arbitrary num\u00e9raire, the model does not encompass money. Frank Hahn, for example, has investigated whether general equilibrium models can be developed in which money enters in some essential way. One of the essential questions he introduces, often referred to as the Hahn's problem is: \"Can one construct an equilibrium where money has value?\" The goal is to find models in which existence of money can alter the equilibrium solutions, perhaps because the initial position of agents depends on monetary prices.", "Frank Hahn defends general equilibrium modeling on the grounds that it provides a negative function.

Lindahl's formulation of the concept of sequence economies and intertemporal equilibrium (1929, 1930) is by far the first rigorous attempt to do so. Lindahl's couching of a theory of capital (1929, 1939) in intertemporal terms anticipates Malinvaud's (1953) famous attempt. The transfer of Lindahl's concepts to the anglophone world was accomplished by two of his most ardent supporters, John Hicks (1939, 1965) and Friedrich Hayek (1941). Since then, his work on \"sequence analysis\" has been given greater emphasis since the work of Frank Hahn (1973) and Roy Radner (1972).  Lindahl's 1919 solution to the pricing of public goods is another noticeable achievement, brought into modern economics by Duncan Foley (1970)."]}, {"page": "Philosophy and economics", "response": ["* Frank Hahn "]}]}}
