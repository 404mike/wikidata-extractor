He was Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Wales, where he taught from 1980 until 1996, and was Honorary Research Professor at the University of Sheffield from 1996 until 2008. In the 1960s and 1970s he taught at the universities of St. Andrews and Durham. From 1993 until 2004 he acted as Literary Director of the John Foxe Project at the British Academy; he subsequently became an Honorary Member of the History Faculty at the University of Oxford. After military service in the Royal Air Force 1953\u20131955, Loades studied at the University of Cambridge. He wrote many books on the Tudor period, including biographies. He was President of the Ecclesiastical History Society (1992-93).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry VIII", "response": ["Although Henry's marriage to Catherine has since been described as \"unusually good\", it is known that Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, either Elizabeth or Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. The most significant mistress for about three years, starting in 1516, was Elizabeth Blount. Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses, considered by some to be few for a virile young king. Exactly how many Henry had is disputed: David Loades believes Henry had mistresses \"only to a very limited extent\", whilst Alison Weir believes there were numerous other affairs. Catherine is not known to have protested. In 1518 she fell pregnant again with another girl, who was also stillborn.", "Although the central tenets of Elton's thesis have since been questioned, it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work, including that of J. J. Scarisbrick, his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Elton's regard for Cromwell's abilities but returned agency to Henry, who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy. For Scarisbrick, Henry was a formidable, captivating man who \"wore regality with a splendid conviction\". The effect of endowing Henry with this ability, however, was largely negative in Scarisbrick's eyes: to Scarisbrick, the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise. Even among more recent biographers, including David Loades, David Starkey and John Guy, there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the assessment of those he did bring about."]}, {"page": "Mary Rose", "response": ["The common explanation for the ship's name was that it was inspired by Henry VIII's favourite sister, Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and the rose as the emblem of the Tudors.See for example McKee (1974), p. 4; Rodger (1997), p. 172; Rule (1983), p. 15; Weightman (1957), p. 286. According to the historians David Childs, David Loades and Peter Marsden, no direct evidence of naming the ship after the King's sister exists. It was far more common at the time to give ships pious Christian names, a long-standing tradition in Western Europe, or to associate them with their royal patrons. Names like Grace Dieu (Hallelujah) and Holighost (Holy Spirit) had been common since the 15th century and other Tudor navy ships had names like the Regent and Three Ostrich Feathers (referring to the crest of the Prince of Wales).Childs (2007), p. 17; David Loades, \"The Mary Rose and Fighting Ships\" in Marsden (2009), p. 5; Peter Marsden, \"Reconstruction of the Mary Rose: her Design and Use\" in Marsden (2009), p. 379."]}, {"page": "1551", "response": ["* October 11 \u2013 John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, de facto Lord Protector of the Kingdom of England, is created Duke of Northumberland.David Loades (1996): John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland 1504\u20131553.

Until recent decades, Seymour's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class.; . In the early 20th century this line was taken by the influential A. F. Pollard, to be echoed by Edward VI's 1960s biographer W. K. Jordan. A more critical approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the mid-1970s. Since then, the first Duke of Somerset has often been portrayed as an arrogant ruler, devoid of the political and administrative skills necessary for governing the Tudor state.David Loades,  \"The reign of Edward VI: An historiographical survey\"  Historian 67#1 (2000): 22+ online"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*David Loades (1934\u20132016), Tudor England"]}, {"page": "John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland", "response": ["Northumberland rode through the City of London to the Tower on 25 July, with his guards struggling to protect him against the hostile populace.Chapman 1962 pp. 150\u2013151 A pamphlet appearing shortly after his arrest illustrated the general hatred of him: \"the great devil Dudley ruleth, Duke I should have said\".Alford 2002 p. 7 He was now commonly thought to have poisoned King Edward while Mary \"would have been as glad of her brother's life, as the ragged bear is glad of his death\".Alford 2002 p. 8; Loades 1996 p. 257 Dumbfounded by the turn of events, the French ambassador Noailles wrote: \"I have witnessed the most sudden change believable in men, and I believe that God alone worked it.\"Loades 1996 p. 265 David Loades, biographer of both Queen Mary and John Dudley, concludes that the lack of fighting clouds the fact that this outcome was a close-run affair, and warns"]}, {"page": "John Foxe", "response": ["On 20 March 1563, Foxe published the first English edition of the Actes and Monuments from the press of John Day.Day's epitaph reads: \"He set a Foxe to write how martyrs run/By death to life.

As is typical for the period, the full title was a paragraph long and is abbreviated by scholars as Acts and Monuments,The full title is \"Actes and Monuments of these latter and perilous days, touching matters of the Church, wherein are comprehended and described the great persecutions and horrible troubles that have been wrought and practised by the Romish prelates, specially in this realm of England and Scotland, from the year of our Lord 1000 unto the time now present; gathered and collected according to the true copies and writings certificatory, as well of the parties themselves that suffered, as also out of the bishops' registers, which were the doers thereof; by John Foxe.\" although the book was popularly known then, as it is now, as Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Publication of the book made Foxe instantly famous \u2013 \"England's first literary celebrity\" \u2013 although because there were then no royalties, Foxe remained as poor as ever although the book sold for more than ten shillings, three weeks' pay for a skilled craftsman.Mozley, p. 130; David Loades, \"The Early Reception\" .", "By the end of the 17th century, however, the work tended to be abbreviated to include only \"the most sensational episodes of torture and death\", thus giving to Foxe's work \"a lurid quality which was certainly far from the author's intention.\" Because Foxe was used to attack Catholicism and a rising tide of high-church Anglicanism, the book's credibility was challenged in the early 19th century by a number of authors, most importantly, Samuel R. Maitland.Freeman, ODNB. Maitland, Six letters on Foxe's Acts and Monuments (1837). In the words of one Catholic Victorian, after Maitland's critique, \"no one with any literary pretensions... ventured to quote Foxe as an authority.\"D. Trenow, \"The Credibility of John Foxe, the 'martyrologist' (1868), quoted in Freeman, ODNB. Further analysis of Maitland's criticism in the 21st century has in the words of David Loades, that Maitland \"deserves to be treated with genuine, but limited, respect. His demolition of the martyrologist's history of the Waldenses, and of some of his other medieval reconstructions, was accurate up to a point, but he never addressed those parts of the Acts and Monuments where Foxe was at his strongest, and his general conclusion that the work was nothing but a tissue of fabrications and distortions is not supported by modern analysis.\"David Loades, \"The Maitland Controversy\""]}, {"page": "The Other Boleyn Girl", "response": ["* Incest between Anne and George Boleyn. Historically, Anne Boleyn was charged by Henry's appointed officials of committing incest with her brother. The novel heavily implies but does not state that Anne, convinced that Henry VIII could not give her a healthy son, resorts to incest with her brother. Both the 2003 BBC production of The Other Boleyn Girl and the 2008 film with Natalie Portman depict the two attempting but not committing incest. None of the sources Gregory listed in her bibliography questions Anne Boleyn's innocence. Gregory used two biographies of Anne, one by the American historian Retha Warnicke and another source by Marie-Louise Bruce (1972). Both these writers insisted that Anne was innocent, as did books by David Loades, Alison Weir, and Lacey Baldwin Smith that Gregory had used when researching the story. Gregory did not use Eric Ives's 1986 scholarly biography on Anne Boleyn, The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn: the Most Happy, in which Ives expounds the possible political motives for Anne Boleyn's fall. Ives describes Anne as an active and effective politician, and explains Anne's fall and execution as the result of minister Thomas Cromwell's determination to avoid a similar fate to that of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.Ives, E. W. The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn: the Most Happy; chap. xv There is no evidence supporting Gregory's assertion that Anne had three miscarriages. Gregory ignores the argument, as stated in Eric Ives's biography of Anne Boleyn, that part of the reason Anne was executed was because of her political and religious leanings, which her brother shared and supported."]}, {"page": "Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset", "response": ["*David Loades: John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland 1504\u20131553, 1996, Clarendon Press "]}, {"page": "List of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation", "response": ["An important year in the English Reformation was 1547, when Protestantism became a new force under the child-king Edward VI, England's first Protestant ruler.

In addition to those built in England, he bought up Italian and Hanseatic warships. By March 1513, he proudly watched his fleet sail down the Thames under command of Sir Edmund Howard. It was the most powerful naval force to date in English history: 24 ships led by the 1600 ton \"Henry Imperial\"; the fleet carried 5000 combat marines and 3000 sailors.  It forced the outnumbered French fleet back to its ports, took control of the English Channel, and blockaded Brest.  Henry was the first king to organize the navy as a permanent force, with a permanent administrative and logistical structure, funded by tax revenue and supervised by the new Navy Board.C. S. L.  Davies,  \"The Administration of the Royal Navy under Henry VIII: the origins of the Navy Board.\" English Historical Review 80.315 (1965): 268\u2013288. in JSTOR His personal attention was concentrated on land, where he founded the royal dockyards, planted trees for shipbuilding, enacted laws for inland navigation, guarded the coastline with fortifications, set up a school for navigation and designated the roles of officers and sailors.  He closely supervised the construction of all his warships and their guns, knowing their designs, speed, tonnage, armaments and battle tactics. He encouraged his naval architects, who perfected the Italian technique of mounting guns in the waist of the ship, thus lowering the center of gravity and making it a better platform. He supervised the smallest details and enjoyed nothing more than presiding over the launching of a new ship.A.F. Pollard, Henry VIII (1902) pp 50, 100-2.

Recently, historians such as David Loades have disputed the underlying assumptions of the thesis and have argued that this period was actually one of success and even outright achievements.", "In recent decades revisionist historians, most notably David Loades, have proposed a new interpretation which almost completely reverses the traditional mid-Tudor crisis thesis:"]}, {"page": "Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell", "response": ["It has been incorrectly asserted by early historians such as J.

This has led to negative speculation about the boy's character and abilities which can be disproved.

The family was elevated to the peerage in 1299 as Barons Clifford, and also held the minor baronies of Skipton in North Yorkshire and of Appleby in Westmoreland. The historian Chris Given-Wilson has described the Clifford family as one of the greatest 15th-century families never to receive an earldom. By the time of Clifford's birth, the King, HenryVI, was politically weak and occasionally incapacitated, which prevented him from ruling effectively. His failure to control his nobility, combined with the loss of England's French territories during the latter years of the Hundred Years' War had seen the political situation in England deteriorate into what the scholar David Loades has called a \"chaos of factional quarrels\". Civil war (known to historians as the Wars of the Roses) broke out in 1455. By 1461 a number of battles had been fought between nobles loyal to the Lancastrian King and those of the Yorkists, led by Richard, Duke of York, who had claimed the throne in 1460."]}]}}
