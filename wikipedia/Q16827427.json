In 1843 he published a small booklet on mosaics he had designed and in 1843/45 he was responsible for the mosaic floor at the old Conservative Club in St James's Street, London.Watkin, David. \"Cultured Club.\" bd: The Architects' Website.  He became interested in the manufacture of terracotta around 1839 when he engaged J. G. Bubb on experimental terracotta work for model cottages at Canford Magna, Dorset. This appears to have led to his manufacturing terracotta ornamentation for buildings. In the early 1840s he supplied an extensive series of gothic terracotta mouldings for the English church at Bagni di Lucca in Tuscany.  In the mid 1840s he started working with leading English sculptors, most notably John Bell and William Theed the Younger, for whom he produced terracotta versions of sculptures which were originally sculpted in marble or cast in iron.thumb|Garthmyl Hall Pediment showing terracotta including armorial and ornamented chimney stacks designed by J.K. Colling Blashfield was well connected and patronised by some of the leading architects, particularly the Wyatts, Sydney Smirke and Charles Barry Jr.\"Stratton\"1993, 66  Blashfield also derived many of his ideas for designs from the architects and illustrators  Owen Jones and  James Kellaway Colling.   As result of the popularity of terracotta pieces at the Great Exhibition of 1851, he turned increasingly towards the manufacture of garden furniture, parapets and urns. It has been claimed that at about this time he purchased the moulds from Eleanor Coade's Lambeth works that had been used to produce Coade Stone,Gunnis 1968, 56 but this has been disputed as Coade's bankruptcy was some years before and few of his designs resemble those of Coade, except for the shape of some of the urns.Kelly 1990, 51, 54, 223, 227, 313 The buff colour and texture of Blashfield's Terracotta can resemble the appearance of Coade stone. Blashfield's main works was in Millwall but he had showrooms at Praed Street adjacent to the Edgeware Road in Paddington. In the 1851 Balshfield was still describing himself as a \u201ccement manufacturer\u2019\u2019 and at that time was employing 5 Clerks and 35 Men", "While still in London Blashfiield had been working with the architect and designer James Kellaway Colling who was an associate or partner of the American architect John Hubbard Sturgis. When Sturgis returned to Boston in the US in 1861, he started importing terracotta from Stamford for his first project \"Pinebank\" near Boston. This was followed by the much more prestigious project, supplying terracotta ornament and decorative panels (designed by Colling) for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.Stratton', 144-6 He seriously underestimated the logistical difficulties involved in shipping large consignments of fragile blocks across the Atlantic. He soon realised that he had accepted an uneconomic contract and his company began to incur serious debts when payments were delayed. Delivery of one consignment was held back when a ship had to turn back to England and other payments were delayed when the building contractors were unable to relate the pieces supplied to the intended spaces on the building. From the beginning of 1873 Blashfield was requesting money from his American clients with increasing desperation and by December 1874 the Stamford works, including models, moulds and machinery, was offered for sale.Stratton, 146 In the following month Blashfield announced that the firm was being wound up and he was declared bankrupt in 1878. After the collapse of the business a number of Blashfield's former employees emigrated to America, where they played an important role in the introduction of architectural terracotta.

There appears to be good evidence that he sourced his terracotta from the brickyards which were associated with the Oswestry coalfield at Morda and Trefonen on the Welsh border.\"Stratton\", (1993). pg. 51 Penson used terracotta moulding for church architecture, most notably St Davids, Newtown and Christ Church, Welshpool. As yet no examples the use of the terracotta from these brickyards for domestic buildings is known, although the Trefonen brickyard, which was described as a terracotta works,   was later owned by the railway engineer Thomas Savin and may have been used for some of his projects. James Kellaway Colling used extensive terracotta decoration for Garthmyl Hall, Berriew in Berriew in Montgomeryshire. This was almost certainly sourced from J M Blashfield's terracotta works at Stamford. "]}]}}
