He began his career in British television productions in the early 1980s, and as the decade progressed he became an in-demand charismatic support actor with the plump physique and expressive moon face that he developed in his thirties, noted for his acting range, from frenetic intensity and garrulousness through to refined genteel introspection. To the mid-1980s generation of British children he was known for his role as Roland Rat's inept agent, D'Arcy DeFarcy, who would mistakenly refer to his client as \"Reynard\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vanity Fair (novel)", "response": ["*Vanity Fair (1987), a BBC miniseries starring Eve Matheson as Becky Sharp, Rebecca Saire as Amelia Sedley, James Saxon as Jos Sedley and Simon Dormandy as Dobbin."]}, {"page": "The Wind in the Willows", "response": ["* Three-hour reading by June Whitfield, Nigel Anthony, James Saxon, and Nigel Lambert; Puffin audiobook, 1996."]}, {"page": "Oliver!", "response": ["Cameron Mackintosh produced another revival of the show which opened at the London Palladium in the West End on 8 December 1994.
