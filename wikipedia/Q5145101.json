Due to sharing the same name and being similar in appearance, the two were often assumed to be brothers.Throughout his years at Field Mill, Foster formed a strong defensive partnership with Kevin Bird. He played 43 matches when Mansfield won the Division Four title in 1974-75, and was also almost ever-present when the Stags won Division Three in 1976-77. During the 1976-77 campaign, Foster also scored a career-best nine goals.In 1979, after nine years at Field Mill, Foster moved to Peterborough United for a \u00a313,000 transfer fee. In total, he played 241 first-team games for Mansfield and scored 19 goals. His spell at Peterborough lasted two years, and he later wound down his career with spells at non-league clubs Grantham Town, King's Lynn and Corby Town, where he was player-manager.\nAfter his retirement from the game, Colin settled in the Peterborough area, where he works as a painter and decorator. His son Steve Foster also became a professional footballer, and currently plays for Mansfield Town", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Foster", "response": ["Colin Foster (born 16 July 1964) is an English retired football defender."]}, {"page": "Colin Foster (footballer born 1952)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Foster (footballer, born 1952)"]}, {"page": "1971\u201372 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Colin Foster"]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Colin Foster"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Colin Foster"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Colin Foster"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Colin Foster"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Colin Foster"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Colin Foster"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Colin Foster"]}]}}
