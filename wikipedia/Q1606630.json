His father, Frederick Lokes Slous (original spelling) (1802\u20131892), was Chairman of the London Stock Exchange and his mother, Ann Holgate Sherborn (1827\u20131913), was a published poet. One of his uncles was a painter Henry Courtney Selous. Frederick had three sisters (Florence (born 1850), Annie Berryman (born 1853), and Sybil Jane (born 1862)), and one brother (Edmund Selous (1857\u20131934)) who became a famous ornithologist.

The 12-volume publication, illustrated by the English artist Henry Courtney Selous and edited by Kraszewski, was produced in Warsaw in 1875 by different publishers, so as to reduce costs. Ko\u017amian chose plays with a political dimension that matched his political views, although his choice of The Two Gentlemen of Verona may have been because it was the first play he saw performed in London. He preserved Shakespeare's use of prose and poetry, although arguably to the extent that went to far in some cases when it comes to clarity and style. At first, he translated proper names into Polish phonetically, removing phrases he considered to be vulgar. Kieniewicz notes that the quality of Ko\u017amian's translations varies from jarring to beautiful, but they are nonetheless considered still valuable and useful today. In total, Ko\u017amian translated seven of Shakespeare's plays; in addition to the The Two Gentlemen of Verona those were King Lear, King John, Richard II, A Midsummer Night's Dream and both parts of Henry IV."]}, {"page": "History of Shanghai expo", "response": ["In 1851, a Cantonese business man in Shanghai, Xu Rong-cun (\u5f90\u69ae\u6751) heard of the news of The Great Exhibition.
