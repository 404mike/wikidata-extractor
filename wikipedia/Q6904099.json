He was born in Leamington Spa, the eldest child of Charles Septimus Birch and Clara Birch. 'Monty' had joined the 2nd violins of the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra (today the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra) in 1912 becoming assistant conductor to Dan Godfrey. In 1934 Birch auditioned unsuccessfully for the post of Musical Director. When in 1940 Bournemouth Corporation reduced the size of the orchestra to 24 players, the conductor Richard Austin resigned and Birch took over, steering the orchestra through the war years. He was chief conductor of the orchestra from 1940 until 1946, putting himself forward to be principal conductor, but died on 20 February 1947 before the auditions were held; he was succeeded by Rudolf Schwarz. Birch's funeral took place in St Ambrose's Church, Bournemouth, on 24 February.\nDuring the Second World War he became conductor of the Bournemouth Home Guard Band for whom he composed a Home Guard march, \"the Carabiniers\". His other compositions include the Intermezzo Pizzicati for strings of 1913 and the Dance of the Nymphs (1923), both of which he recorded with the Bournemouth Orchestra for Columbia on 78 rpm discs, a Processional March for organ (published in 1907) and a solo song, The Farmer's Lad (1911) - a setting of his own lyric. Birch also supplied the music for Cyril Delevanti's revue, 'Bournemyth' which was produced in the (old) Winter Gardens in Bournemouth in June 1916.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["Between 1929 and 1934 Stanley Wilson became a regular guest conductor.

Radio broadcasts took place from the Pavilion and a number of celebrated composers visited during this time, including Igor Stravinsky, William Walton, Ernest John Moeran, Sergei Rachmaninov, Roger Quilter, Balfour Gardiner and Percy Grainger. At the outbreak of war, the orchestra was cut from 61 to 35, and then in 1940 to only 24 players.
