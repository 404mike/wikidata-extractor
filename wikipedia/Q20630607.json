She had considerable success in both the UK and US fashion markets, designing both high-end and high-street shoes.\nA graduate of the Royal College of Art, she was among a crop of designers subsequently described by fashion writer and editor Brenda Polan as the \"annus mirabilis\", since so many of them went on to carve highly successful careers in fashion. Although she was among the stars of the 1960s avant-garde boutique scene, Bowler was also highly commercial \u2013 producing designs for high-street chains such as Lilley & Skinner while she was still a student. But most of her commercial success came from her work in the United States, where she designed shoes for brands such as Moderne and Shoe Biz.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of footwear designers", "response": ["* Moya Bowler"]}, {"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* Moya Bowler"]}, {"page": "International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List", "response": ["|Lee Copley Thaw, wife of a patron of Moya Bowler"]}, {"page": "Janey Ironside", "response": ["Ironside's students included Bill Gibb, Ossie Clark, Zandra Rhodes, Moya Bowler, Janice Wainwright, Sally Tuffin and Marion Foale.

Antony Price, a student on the menswear course, went on to create the suited look favoured by Bryan Ferry and others. When the College was given the power to award degrees, however, her School of Fashion was excluded. After Ironside lost her post in 1968, according to her daughter in her book Janey and Me, there followed a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and depression."]}, {"page": "Gerald McCann (fashion designer)", "response": ["McCann's designs frequently appeared in Vogue's 'Young Ideas' section, then supervised by Lady Rendlesham. His bra-cut dresses in denim and gingham, gymslips with low pockets and men's shirt buttons, and trapeze dresses with Peter pan collars were popular among stars such as Julie Christie, Jean Shrimpton and Susannah York. He was also a preferred designer of The Colony Room proprietor Muriel Belcher. In 1965, he dressed Rita Tushingham in the British Palme d'Or-winning comedy The Knack. He was also among the 'young design quartet' \u2013 alongside Jean Muir, Roger Nelson and Moya Bowler \u2013 to produce shoes for Rayne.

While high-end and haute couture were part of the company's pedigree, Edward Rayne always had an eye on the more mainstream direction of fashion \u2013 he was the first to display Mary Quant shoes in his flagship store, placing them alongside those of Roger Vivier. He also gained a foothold in the mass market, ensuring the company had an interest in both H.E. Randall and Lotus chainstores.
