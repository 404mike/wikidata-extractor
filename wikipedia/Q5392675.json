When he was 19 years old, and a Corporal in the 16th Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), British Army during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions during the Battle of Passchendaele.\nOn 20 September 1917 southeast of Ypres, Belgium: ...during an attack, visibility was bad owing to fog and smoke. As a result, the two leading waves of the attack passed over certain hostile dugouts without clearing them and enemy rifles and machine-guns from these dugouts were inflicting severe casualties. Corporal Egerton at once responded to a call for volunteers to help in clearing up the situation and he dashed for the dugouts under heavy fire at short range. He shot a rifleman, a bomber and a gunner, by which time support had arrived and 29 of the enemy surrendered.He later achieved the rank of sergeant. He served in the Home Guard in World War II and died on 14 February 1966.\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Sherwood Foresters Museum in Nottingham Castle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Ernest Albert Egerton || British Army || 1917 || First World War || Ypres"]}, {"page": "Blythe Bridge", "response": ["* Ernest Albert Egerton VC (1897 in Longton \u2013 1966 in Blythe Bridge) recipient of the Victoria Cross    GRAVE LOCATION FOR HOLDERS OF THE VICTORIA CROSS IN THE COUNTY OF STAFFORDSHIRE retrieved 15 February 2018 buried in Blythe Bridge"]}, {"page": "Longton, Staffordshire", "response": ["* Ernest Albert Egerton  (1897\u20131966) English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Sherwood Foresters", "response": ["* Corporal (later Sergeant) Ernest Albert Egerton, First World War"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (E)", "response": ["# Ernest Albert Egerton"]}, {"page": "Ernest A.
