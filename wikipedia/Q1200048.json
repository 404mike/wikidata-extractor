IV and Mk. VII were tested against window in a series of 30 flights. Much to everyone's consternation, Jackson concluded that the Mk. VII's spiral-scan display proved to be affected by window more than the simpler display of the Mk. IV. When he learned the results, Douglas wrote a memo to the Air Ministry asking that window be held back until new radars could be developed that were not as susceptible to its effects."]}, {"page": "Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn", "response": ["Before leaving Germany, Franck attempted to find positions for his former students and colleagues.

They were welcomed by his relatives, the Henschels, and Kuhn received a grant of \u00a3400 per annum, initially for two years, but it was extended to three, and then six. His two sons, Anselm Thomas and Nicholas John, were born in Britain. They attended Dragon School and St Edward's, and entered Balliol College, Oxford, where they earned doctorates. Kuhn became a naturalised British subject in 1939.
