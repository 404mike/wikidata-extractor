Fisher Unwin's \"The Reformer's Bookshelf\" series. The Times selected it as one of its \"Books of the Week\" and said Heath \"was tolerably well known a couple of decades ago as an eloquent and persevering, if not always discriminating, champion of the agricultural labourer\". They added that the book was written with a \"vein of Christian Socialism\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edgar Quinet", "response": ["**Richard Heath, Early Life and Writings of Edgar Quinet (London, 1881)"]}, {"page": "Richard Heath", "response": ["Richard Heath (born August 8, 1955) is a U.S. politician and a Republican member of the Kentucky House of Representatives representing District 2 since January 8, 2013.", "*Richard Heath at Ballotpedia", "*Richard Heath at the National Institute on Money in State Politics"]}]}}
