He was educated at Harrow School, where he was a noted sportsman who played for the cricket and football teams, in addition to winning the Public Schools' Rackets competition in 1876 with Lewis Jarvis. As a cricketer at Harrow, he was described by Wisden as \"one of the hardest hitters ever turned out by Harrow, a good fast bowler and an excellent field at mid-off\". A year after captaining the Harrow cricket team, Meek made a single first-class appearance for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Sussex at Lord's in 1878. His only foray into first-class cricket ended in disappointment, with Meek being dismissed in the MCC's only innings for 0 by Richard Fillery. Away from sport, he was by profession a brewer and was President of the Devizes Chamber of Commerce in 1908. Meek died in Scotland in June 1920 at Gullane, East Lothian."]}]}}
