He was famous for starring, for many years, in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane's annual Christmas pantomimes, predominantly as a dame.\nBorn in Lambeth, Campbell started his performing career appearing in amateur bands  and quickly toured London's music hall's during the early 1860s.  He decided to leave after a few years and adopted the stage name Herbert Campbell. He joined the minstrel performers Harman and Elston and the trio became known as Harmon, Campbell and Elston.  In 1868, Campbell decided to pursue a solo career as a comic vocalist and quickly established himself as a popular music hall comedian.\nIn 1871 he made his first pantomime appearance in King Winter at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool and became a leading pantomime dame over the next decade.  In 1882 he formed a successful association with the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he appeared alongside Dan Leno in the annual Christmas pantomime, every year until his death in 1904 at age 59.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1904", "response": ["* July 19 \u2013 Herbert Campbell, English actor (born 1844)"]}, {"page": "Music hall", "response": ["* Herbert Campbell (1844\u20131904)"]}, {"page": "Blue plaque", "response": ["* Herbert Campbell: 44 Lawford Road, Hackney"]}, {"page": "Dan Leno", "response": ["After these pantomime performances proved popular with audiences, Leno was hired in 1888 by Augustus Harris, manager at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to appear in that year's Christmas pantomime, Babes in the Wood.Anthony, p. 88 Harris's pantomime productions at the huge theatre were known for their extravagance and splendour. Each one had a cast of over a hundred performers, ballet dancers, acrobats, marionettes and animals, and included an elaborate transformation scene and an energetic harlequinade. Often they were partly written by Harris.\"Mr. Pitcher's Art\", Obituary, The Times, 3 March 1925Anthony, p. 87 Herbert Campbell and Harry Nicholls starred with Leno in the next fifteen Christmas productions at Drury Lane. Campbell had appeared in the theatre's previous five pantomimes and was a favourite of the writer of those productions, E. L. Blanchard. Blanchard left the theatre when Leno was hired, believing that music hall performers were unsuitable for his Christmas pantomimes.

The death affected Leno deeply, and he went into a decline. At that time, he was appearing at the London Pavilion, but the show had to be cancelled owing to his inability to remember his lines.

After a short Shakespeare season, presented by Marie Litton's company, Harris staged the first of his series of melodramas, The World (July 1880), which he co-wrote, staged, and acted in (Wearing comments, \"he never took things lightly\"). He established a pattern of lucrative melodramas in the late summer and autumn and even more lucrative pantomimes in the winter, all of which subsidised the culturally ambitious seasons he presented in the spring and early summer. In his pantomimes Harris featured top-line music-hall stars \u2013 Marie Lloyd, Kate Santley and Vesta Tilley among the women performers and Herbert Campbell, Dan Leno, Arthur Roberts and Little Tich among the men. Some critics held that Harris had vulgarised the pantomime by importing music-hall turns, particularly knockabout comedians, but the theatre historian Phyllis Hartnoll writes that he \"had a feeling for the old harlequinade, providing for it lavish scenery and machinery and engaging excellent clowns and acrobats\".Hartnoll, Phyllis, and Peter Found.  \"Harris, Sir Augustus Henry Glossop\", The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre,  Oxford University Press, 2003.
