He fought in the First Anglo-Sikh War, in the Second Anglo-Sikh War and then in the Crimean War: during the latter conflict at the Battle of Inkerman, he held an important barrier on the post road guarding the approach to the 2nd Division camp for six hours. He served in India during the Indian Rebellion before becoming Commanding Officer of the 8th Regiment of Foot in the United Kingdom and then Commander of a Brigade in Ireland. He went on to be General Officer Commanding the Mysore Division of the Madras Army and then Quartermaster-General to the Forces in the United Kingdom. He returned to India to become Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army in May 1871 and then Commander-in-Chief, India in April 1876: he commanded the forces in India during the Second Anglo-Afghan War and successfully argued for a large force being made available before mobilisation occurred, but once the war started the Governor-General of India, Lord Lytton, was inclined to by-pass Haines and deal direct with commanders in the field, causing friction between the two men.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brompton Cemetery", "response": ["* Field Marshall Frederick Haines"]}, {"page": "Haines (surname)", "response": ["*Frederick Haines  (1819\u20131909), British Field Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of British forces in India "]}, {"page": "Royal Scots Fusiliers", "response": ["The regiment saw action at the Siege of Fort Ticonderoga in July 1777 during the American Revolutionary War,Cannon, p. 26 took part in the Siege of Bergen op Zoom in March 1814 during the Napoleonic WarsCannon, p. 38 and saw combat at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 during the War of 1812.Cannon, p. 42 The regiment then served under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Haines at the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 during the Crimean War.Heathcote, p. 164"]}, {"page": "Quartermaster-General to the Forces", "response": ["*1870\u20131871 General Sir Frederick Haines"]}]}}
