On 7 December, a 2\u20130 loss at Belle Vue from Doncaster Rovers sent Vale to the foot of the table. As a result of this, the club put in a large bid for Wigan Athletic's Jack Roberts, and consequently signed the highly promising forward. Meanwhile, injuries and constant rotation of the first eleven worked against the team. A 4\u20130 defeat from West Ham United at Upton Park on 21 December was followed by the club's first away win in sixteen attempts five days later. The win came over a poor Hull City side in ankle deep mud.
