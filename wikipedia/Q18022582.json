Dizzee Rascal personally claimed his song \"Crime\", released in 2000, was the first grime song. DJ Slimzee and DJ Karnage have also suggested \"Year 2000\" (released 2000) by Wiley as a contender.

At the time the station broadcast from secret, makeshift locations such as kitchens and bedrooms belonging to friends and DJs, constantly moving between these locations to avoid getting shut down by authorities.

Thump. Vice Media. Retrieved 29 August 2017. Due to Stott's goal of making a grime-influenced LP, most of Too Many Voices consists of sounds from a Korg Triton synthesizer that were also used in the grime works of acts such as DJ Slimzee, Dizzee Rascal, and Wiley. While he originally bought the Triton to give the album a grime style, he later got into the keyboard's other non-grime-related presets, including ethereal, sometimes choir-based pads: \"It's kind of made me play in a different way, really. Just the sound of it, the machine, is really strange... Keeping space in the record was really a conscious thing. I really wanted to put more space in there.\"Carlick, Stephen (26 April 2016). \"Andy Stott Discusses His Obsession with Sampled Sounds on 'Too Many Voices'\". Exclaim!. Retrieved 30 August 2017. These textures are also on the record given that Stott enjoyed sounds that tried to be organic but were actually fake.

Together they formed a group called 'The Ladies Hit Squad'. Major Ace, Plague, God's Gift, and DJ Slimzee also hosted their own show on Rinse FM every Sunday. In the summer of 2000, the Pay As You Go phone network was experiencing network errors coincidentally every Sunday coinciding with their show, allowing everyone to call into the radio show for free. After three weeks of this, Plague dubbed the show the \"pay as you go show\". The pay as you go radio show and Ladies Hit Squad's show on Rinse FM were the most popular shows on Rinse FM at the time, leading to the owner of Rinse FM suggesting that Ladies Hit Squad and the pay as you go show merge, leading to the official Pay As U Go crew being formed. Flowdan, Riko Dan, Dom P, Breeze and Bubbles later joined the group. The group released a dubplate, \"Know We\", in late 1999. The song was officially released in 2000 as their debut single."]}]}}
