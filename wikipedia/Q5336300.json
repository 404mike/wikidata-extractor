The boundary changes had arisen due to his own campaign for the number of MPs representing Northern Ireland to be increased to the equivalent proportion for the rest of the United Kingdom, as part of the steps towards greater integration. McGrady paid tribute to Powell, recognising the respect he was held by both Unionists and Nationalists in the constituency. Powell said, \"For the rest of my life when I look back on the 13 years I shall be filled with affection for the Province and its people, and their fortunes will never be out of my heart\". He received a warm ovation from the mostly Nationalist audience and as he walked off the platform, he said the words Edmund Burke used on the death of candidate Richard Coombe: \"What shadows we are, what shadows we pursue\". When a BBC reporter asked Powell to explain his defeat, he replied: \"My opponent polled more votes than me\"."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Eddie McGrady", "| Eddie McGrady"]}, {"page": "1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Eddie McGrady"]}, {"page": "Mark Durkan", "response": ["He became involved in politics in 1981 when he became a member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.
