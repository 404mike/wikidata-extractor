This was discovered at about the same time by Kazimierz Fajans, and is known as the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy, a fundamental step toward understanding the relationships among families of radioactive elements. In 1913 Soddy also described the phenomenon in which a radioactive element may have more than one atomic mass though the chemical properties are identical. He named this concept isotope meaning \"same place\". The word was initially suggested to him by Margaret Todd. Later, J. J. Thomson showed that non-radioactive elements can also have multiple isotopes."]}, {"page": "Sophia Jex-Blake", "response": ["Sophia Jex-Blake was born at 3 Croft Place Hastings, England on 21 January 1840, daughter of retired lawyer Thomas Jex-Blake, a proctor of Doctors' Commons, and Mary Jex-Blake (n\u00e9e Cubitt).Shirley Roberts, \u2018Blake, Sophia Louisa Jex- (1840\u20131912)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 11 Nov 2008 Her brother was Thomas Jex-Blake, future Dean of Wells Cathedral, and father of Katharine Jex-Blake, classicist and Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge. Until the age of eight she was home-educated. She attended various private schools in southern England and in 1858 enrolled at Queen's College, London, despite her parents' objections. In 1859, while still a student, she was offered a post as mathematics tutor at the college where she stayed until 1861, living for some of that time with Octavia Hill's family. She worked without pay: her family did not expect their daughter to earn a living, and indeed her father refused her permission to accept a salary.Margaret Todd, The Life of Sophia Jex-Blake (Macmillan, 1918)According to Virginia Woolf, this was a \"typical instance of the great Victorian fight ... of the daughters against the fathers\" where a father would hope to keep a daughter in his power by saying earning a living was \"beneath her\".  See chapter 3 of Three Guineas  (1938)", "Jex-Blake is assumed to have been in a romantic relationship with Dr Margaret Todd.

It was coined by Scottish doctor and writer Margaret Todd in 1913 in a suggestion to chemist Frederick Soddy.", "Soddy proposed that several types of atoms (differing in radioactive properties) could occupy the same place in the table. For example, the alpha-decay of uranium-235 forms thorium-231, whereas the beta decay of actinium-230 forms thorium-230. The term \"isotope\", Greek for \"at the same place\", was suggested to Soddy by Margaret Todd, a Scottish physician and family friend, during a conversation in which he explained his ideas to her.Soddy first used the word \"isotope\" in: Scerri, Eric R. (2007) The Periodic Table, Oxford University Press, , Ch. 6, note 44 (p. 312) citing Alexander Fleck, described as a former student of Soddy's.In his 1893 book, William T. Preyer also used the word \"isotope\" to denote similarities among elements. From p. 9 of William T. Preyer, Das genetische System der chemischen Elemente [The genetic system of the chemical elements] (Berlin, Germany: R. Friedl\u00e4nder & Sohn, 1893): \"Die ersteren habe ich der K\u00fcrze wegen isotope Elemente genannt, weil sie in jedem der sieben St\u00e4mmme der gleichen Ort, n\u00e4mlich dieselbe Stuffe, einnehmen.\" (For the sake of brevity, I have named the former \"isotopic\" elements, because they occupy the same place in each of the seven families [i.e., columns of the periodic table], namely the same step [i.e., row of the periodic table].)

In examining the radiation, he classified Becquerel radiation into two types, which he called \u03b1 (alpha) and \u03b2 (beta) radiation. Subsequently, Paul Villard discovered a third type of Becquerel radiation which, following Rutherford's scheme, were called \"gamma rays\", and Curie noted that radium also produced a radioactive gas. Identifying the gas chemically proved frustrating; Rutherford and Frederick Soddy found it to be inert, much like argon. It later came to be known as radon. Rutherford identified beta rays as cathode rays (electrons), and hypothesised\u2014and in 1909 with Thomas Royds proved\u2014that alpha particles were helium nuclei. Observing the radioactive disintegration of elements, Rutherford and Soddy classified the radioactive products according to their characteristic rates of decay, introducing the concept of a half-life. In 1903, Soddy and Margaret Todd applied the term \"isotope\" to atoms that were chemically and spectroscopically identical but had different radioactive half-lives. Rutherford proposed a model of the atom in which a very small, dense and positively charged nucleus of protons was surrounded by orbiting, negatively charged electrons (the Rutherford model). Niels Bohr improved upon this in 1913 by reconciling it with the quantum behaviour of electrons (the Bohr model)."]}, {"page": "Margaret G. Todd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margaret Todd (doctor)"]}]}}
