In the FA Cup Hereford after beating Godalming Town, Kempston Rovers and A.F.C. Hornchurch, Hereford were drawn a game away to Eastleigh where goals from Mike McGrath and Garyn Preen (who was later knocked unconscious by Gavin Hoyte that game) took Hereford into the first round for the first time in their history. In the first round, a John Mills goal against AFC Telford United put them in the second round where they were drawn against Fleetwood Town. A goal from Calvin Dinsley earned Hereford a replay which was televised on BT Sport and got an attendance of 4,235 which Hereford ended up losing. Fleetwood then went on to play Leicester City in the third round. In the FA Trophy, Hereford beat Weymouth, Potters Bar Town and Oxford City to make the first round. Hereford beat National League side Dagenham & Redbridge 3\u20132 to set up a tie against Wealdstone. In the Wealdstone game there was a moment of controversy after Dara O'Shea seemed to bring down a player when he was through on goal which resulted in him getting sent off. Footage later on showed O'Shea should not have been given a red card so the FA reversed the decision. Hereford ended up losing that game 1\u20130."]}]}}
