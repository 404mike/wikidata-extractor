Born to a British mother and a Hong Kong father, Mo lived in Hong Kong until the age of 10, when he moved to Britain. Educated at Mill Hill School and St John's College, Oxford, Mo worked as a journalist before becoming a novelist.His works have won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, the Hawthornden Prize, and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize (for fiction), and three of his novels were shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction. Mo was also the recipient of the 1992 E. M. Forster Award. His novel An Insular Possession (1986) was among the contenders in The Telegraph's list of the 10 all-time greatest Asian novels.In the early 1990s Mo became increasingly mistrustful of his publishers and increasingly outspoken about the publishing industry in general. Since 1994 when he rejected a \u00a3125,000 advance from Random House for his next novel, he has self-published his books under the label \"Paddleless Press\". His first novel to be self-published was Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 30", "response": ["*1950 \u2013 Timothy Mo, Chinese-English author"]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["|Timothy Mo || Sour Sweet  || Deutsch", "|Timothy Mo || An Insular Possession || Chatto & Windus", "|Timothy Mo || The Redundancy of Courage || Chatto & Windus", "*Timothy Mo"]}, {"page": "Congreve rocket", "response": ["* In Timothy Mo's novel about the foundation of Hong Kong, An Insular Possession, Congreve rockets are used by Captain Elliot from the steamer Nemesis against Chinese forts on the Pearl River."]}, {"page": "First Opium War", "response": ["* Timothy Mo, An Insular Possession (Chatto and Windus, 1986; Paddleless Press, 2002)"]}, {"page": "List of Chinese writers", "response": ["* Timothy Mo (born 1950)", "* Timothy Mo (born 1950)"]}, {"page": "1999 in literature", "response": ["*James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction: Timothy Mo, Renegade, or Halo2"]}, {"page": "1991 in literature", "response": ["*Timothy Mo \u2013 The Redundancy of Courage"]}, {"page": "1982 in literature", "response": ["*Timothy Mo \u2013 Sour Sweet"]}, {"page": "1978 in literature", "response": ["*Timothy Mo \u2013 The Monkey King"]}, {"page": "1950 in literature", "response": ["*December 30 \u2013 Timothy Mo, Hong Kong British novelist"]}, {"page": "List of historical novels", "response": ["*An Insular Possession by Timothy Mo (Canton, Macau, and Hong Kong) (1833-1841)"]}, {"page": "The Mauritius Command", "response": ["O'Brian's British fans include T.
