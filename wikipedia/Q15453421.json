His trip to South America is recounted in \"A Railway Beyond the Clouds\", \"A Ride to the City of the Sun\", \"A Paradise of Tomorrow\", \"The Most Majestic Mountain\", and \"Los Medanos\". His travels of North America in \"The Snake-Dancers of Arizona\" are somehow even more exotic. Griffith claims to have made the first intentional flight across the English Channel in \"To France by Air\". In \"When will the 20th Century Begin?\", Griffith discusses the intricacies of time zones, something with which he had quite a lot of practice. The Apogee edition includes an introduction by Griffith's grandson, John Griffith, relating some of the family history, particularly of Alan Arnold Griffith, and a biography of George Griffith by editor Robert Godwin.
