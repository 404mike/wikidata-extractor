Doncaster had been admitted to the Football League Second Division for the 1901\u221202 season at the very last minute as New Brighton Tower had folded and resigned from the League, so many players had to have their registrations updated. Simpson's transfer fee, set by the Football League, was \u00a315. Simpson was captain for their very first League match against Burslem Port Vale on 7 September 1901.In his time at Doncaster, he played in 67 Football League and F.A. Cup matches scoring 3 goals. Additionally, in his first season there, 1900\u221201, Doncaster played 26 Midland League, 6 F.A. Cup, and 5 minor cup games, and they won the Mexborough Montague Charity Cup final.Finishing third from bottom in the 1902\u221203 season, Rovers had to apply for re-election but unfortunately failed, so many of their players moved to other clubs, including Simpson who went to Chesterfield. In all competitions he made 25 appearances for Chesterfield in 1903 moving onto Rotherham County in the Midland League the following season.He died in Sheffield in 1955.", "link_mentions": {}}}
