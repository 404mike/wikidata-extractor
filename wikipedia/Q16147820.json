They gave Roseberry Topping its present name; first attested in 1119 as \"Othenesberg\", its second element is accepted to derive from Old Norse bjarg (rock); the first element must be an Old Norse personal name, Authunn or \u00d3thinn, giving 'Authunn's/\u00d3thinn's rock'. If the latter, Roseberry Topping is one of only a handful of known pagan names in England, being named after the Norse god Odin and paralleled by the Old English name Wodnesberg, found for example in Woodnesborough.Victor Watts (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v.

The naming of the hill may thus fit a well-established pattern in Continental Europe of hills and mountains being named after Odin or the Germanic equivalent, Wodan. Aelfric of Eynsham, writing in the 10th century, recorded how \"the heathens made him into a celebrated god and made offerings to him at crossroads and brought oblations to high hills for him.

The festival, he says, was celebrated in the large grove between the Via Salaria and the Tiber river, where the Romans who survived the battle had hidden. The Via Salaria crossed the battlefield about 10 miles north of Rome.William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 182. The lucus thus would have been located on the Pincian Hill, which was later cultivated as gardens and leisure parks by Lucullus, Pompeius, Sallust and others.Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 183. This explanatory story has been compared to that of the Poplifugia, which also involved the Gallic sack of Rome.Fowler, Roman Festivals, pp. 182\u2013183. The story may be more aetiological than historical.Ken Dowden, European Paganism: The Realities of Cult from Antiquity to the Middle Ages (Routledge, 2000), p. 107.

Furrina was associated with water, and the Furrinalia follows the Lucaria (Festival of the Grove) on 19 and 21 July and the Neptunalia on 23 July, a grouping that may reflect a concern for summer drought.Robert Schilling, \"Neptune,\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 138.

The Old High German cognate l\u00f4h also means \"clearing, holy grove.\" Lucus appears to have been understood in this sense in early medieval literature; until the 10th century, it is regularly translated into OHG as harug, a word never used for the secular silva.D.H. Green, Language and history in the early Germanic world (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2000), p. 26. Servius, however, somewhat perversely says that a lucus is so called because non luceat, \"it is not illuminated,\" perhaps implying that a proper sacred grove hosted only legitimate daytime ceremonies and not dubious nocturnal rites that required torchlight.Non quod sint ibi lumina causa religionis: Servius, note to Aeneid 1.441; Ken Dowden, European Paganism: The Realities of Cult from Antiquity to the Middle Ages (Routledge, 2000), p. 74."]}, {"page": "Cypria", "response": ["The Cypria, in the written form in which it was known in classical Greece, was probably composed in the late seventh century BC,\"An indication that at least the main contents of the Cypria were known around 650 BC is provided by the representation of the Judgement of Paris on the Chigi vase\" (Burkert 1992:103).

Evelyn-White notedIn his Preface to Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica \"were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by Homer,\" one of the reasons for dating the final, literary form of Cypria as post-Homeric, in effect a \"prequel\". \"The author of the Kypria already regarded the Iliad as a text.

A comparison can be made with the Aethiopis, also lost, but which even in its quoted fragments is more independent of the Iliad as text."]}, {"page": "Divona", "response": ["In ancient Roman religion, goddesses of freshwater sources are often associated with the deity Fons, god of fountains and wellheads, honored at the Fontinalia for his role in the public water supply for the city. Ausonius invokes fons, the manmade outlet that makes the water available to the people, with a string of adjectives: sacer, alme, perennis, / vitree, glauce, profunde, sonore, illimis, opace,Ausonius, Ordo nobilium urbium 20.30\u201331 (Green lines 157\u2013158). The adjectives are masculine to agree with fons and appear in the vocative case, as is customary for a Latin invocation. \"sacred, life-giving, eternal, / glassy, blue-green,The color word glaucus (Greek glaukos) evokes a range of grey, green, and blue indeterminately, and can often be translated as \"sea-colored\" or even \"sky-colored.\" It has divine connotations and is associated with various deities, for instance, as the color of Athena's eyes. See P.G. Maxwell-Stuart, Studies in Greek Colour Terminology: \u0393\u039b\u0391\u03a5\u039a\u039f\u03a3 (Brill, 1981), vol. 1, pp. 40\u201342, and a brief discussion of the color as associated with Pluto. measureless, sonorous, free of mud, shaded.\" He hails fons as the \"Genius of the city\" (urbis genius) having the power to offer a healing draught (medico potabilis haustu). In the next line, Ausonius says that this genius or tutelary deity is Divona in the Celtic language (Divona Celtarum lingua), that is, fons added to the divae (plural).The phrase fons addite divis is somewhat difficult to interpret. It is sometimes construed as \"fons\" addite \"divis\", that is \"Add (plural imperative) the word fons to the word divae/divi\" (masculine singular divus). In the plural dative and ablative cases, the masculine and feminine forms are the same, and divis could be either, but Ausonius seems to be connecting the masculine fons to the feminine Divona. In Latin, the word lymphae, plural, means \"waters\" but is also an Italic word for \"nymphs\"; a plural divae here might suggest the same tendency to regard water nymphs as both a singular and a plural collective. The verbal form addite, however, can also be construed as a perfect passive participle in the vocative case, parallel in construction with the string of vocative adjectives, that is, \"Fons, added to the goddesses.\" Ausonius \"hails\" (salve) the \"Genius of the city,\" but genius is not in the vocative case. Fons addite divis is sometimes taken as a proffered etymology: Ausonius may be proposing that the word Divona is formed from the word divus, Gaulish devos, plus fons = -ona, taking fons as the equivalent of a Gaulish word onno, \"stream, river,\" the existence of which is doubtful. The suffix -ona is found in the names of several Gallic goddesses.
