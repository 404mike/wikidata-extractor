He runs a local science-fiction media store called \"Hellmouths\" and has been out of a relationship for several months. Oliver often has a very cynical outlook, but is prone to accidents, often making a fool of himself in the process. He is sometimes shown gearing himself up to meet women and have sex by thinking to himself, which the audience can hear. The geekiness of his job is also used for comic effect. Oliver also seems to have inherited Jeff's inability to talk to women, however, unlike Jeff he believes himself to be a ladies' man, or in his thoughts' words \"a woman-killer, I mean lady-killer...\". Oliver has a tendency to use the word 'craziness' frequently in conversations, usually as an attempt to alleviate tension when he starts blabbering. Richard Mylan has said in interview that people took a long time to accept his character due to Jeff's popularity."]}, {"page": "Bad Girls (TV series)", "response": ["* Richard Mylan as Ben Phillips/Ben Hennessey (Series 6\u20137)"]}, {"page": "A Taste of Honey", "response": ["* The Boy \u2013 Richard Mylan"]}, {"page": "Where the Heart Is (British TV series)", "response": ["* Richard Mylan as Danny Flint (series 9\u201310)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Swansea", "response": ["*Richard Mylan"]}, {"page": "Grownups (2006 TV series)", "response": ["*Chris (2007\u20132009) (Richard Mylan) replaced Mike as Michelle's flatmate.
