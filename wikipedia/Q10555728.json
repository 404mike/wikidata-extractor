There was even hopes of the championship in the Spring of 1989 and 4,239 people saw the Wanderers beat Kidderminster Harriers 1\u20130 at Loakes Park, the largest attendance for more than a dozen years. That attendance was eclipsed a couple of months later when 4,890 witnessed Kettering Town steal a 1\u20130 win, the biggest Conference crowd that season. It was a result that put paid to any hopes of winning the league. They were also hopes of another Wembley visit in the FA Trophy, but 1,000 travelling Chairboys saw their dreams come crashing down on the plastic pitch of Hyde United, who created a shock by winning 1\u20130. Kelman had brought in players like Andy Robinson, Martin Blackler, Steve Abbley, Matt Crossley, John Kerr, Andy Kerr and Glyn Creaser, who cost \u00a315,000 from Barnet After the devastating blow of defeat by Hyde, Kelman pulled off a transfer coup, signing the highly rated Barnet striker Nicky Evans for a non-league record fee of \u00a332,000. Evans scored a brace on his debut against Boston United and hopes were high that the club could push on and challenge for the Football League again the following season. Kelman made more astute signings, bringing in Simon Stapleton and Steve Guppy. The team's results and performances were inconsistent. High-flying Barnet were beaten 1\u20130 and a 3\u20130 deficit at home to Kidderminister Harriers was turned around in dramatic fashion when John Kerr's diving header snatched a 3\u20133 draw five minutes from time. On the flip side Cheltenham Town handed out a 4\u20130 thrashing at Loakes Park and the team was hit for four again at Telford United. It was a hugely embarrassing 3\u20131 defeat at Loakes Park in the FA Trophy by the Metropolitan Police that heralded the end of Jim Kelman's reign. The cup exit played its part but the managers relationship with the board had been deteriorating for some time and Kelman handed in his resignation. Kelman's legacy would be there for all to see as his successor would build his historic side out of many of the players brought to the club by Kelman.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887\u20131996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 70. .", "Martin O'Neill kept faith with the team that had come so close to promotion and the 1992\u201393 season started in similar fashion to the last one, with the side winning nine league games in a row. An exciting tie took place in the second round of the FA Cup, with the Blues drawn at home to Ossie Ardiles' Third Division side West Bromwich Albion. A stunning fightback, live on Sky TV, saw goals from Glyn Creaser and Steve Thompson take the Baggies back to the Hawthorns. The replay was also shown live, and an amazing 4,500 Wycombe fans made the journey to the black country. They saw Keith Scott hit a post before Bob Taylor snatched a goal winner just nine minutes from time. Even in injury-time the Wanderers came agonisingly close to snatching an equaliser, Steve Guppy just inches from connecting with a Simon Hutchinson cross.", "Inspirational captain Glyn Creaser suffered a bad injury to his foot and when the side went on a run of four games without a win in February and March 1993, local rivals Slough Town came within four points of the Blues, having played two games more. The sides met at Adams Park and a then record crowd of 7,230, with many more locked out, saw a tense game that was decided by a 27th winner from Keith Scott. Wanderers had to play most of the second half with ten men when Andy Kerr was sent off, but some determined defending and fine goalkeeping from Paul Hyde ensured the three points. Martin O'Neill signed striker Tim Langford from Telford United for \u00a315,000 and the sides went on another run in the FA Trophy. Wins over Cheltenham Town, Morecambe, Bromsgrove Rovers and Gateshead led the club to semi-final with Sutton United, managed by former boss Alan Gane. The U's sprung a great shock by winning the first leg at Adams Park 3\u20132. The tie was missed by Keith Scott through injury and he even took to an oxygen chamber to get fit for the second leg. The tension was palpable as more than half the 5,002 crowd at Gander Green Lane travelled to support the Blues. Keith Scott was declared fit and after a number of missed chances, centre-back Matt Crossley headed home from a corner and immediate sunk to his knees with a mixture of joy and relief. The visitors came out in the second half and grabbed the tie by the throat. On 48 minutes Keith Scott headed home from a Guppy corner and three minutes later Matt Crossley swept home another corner, this time from Dave Carroll, to make it 3\u20130. Keith Scott was replaced by Mark West with 15 minutes and within three minutes with his first touch he crossed for Dave Carroll to finish emphatically to make it 4\u20130. The 6\u20133 aggregate win saw the Blues go back to Wembley and the pitch was engulfed by celebrating fans at the final whistle. The following week there was even more celebrations, after a 1\u20131 draw with nearest challengers Slough Town, a 5\u20131 thrashing of Runcorn at Adams Park, including a sensational solo goal from Steve Guppy, saw the Wanderers all but seal promotion to the Football League.", "One trophy did prove elusive as Northwich Victoria came to Adams Park and won the Drinkwise Cup 3\u20132 in extra time. The FA Trophy final at Wembley saw 28,000 Wycombe fans make the short, but increasingly familiar journey to face Runcorn Jason Cousins smashed home a free-kick after just two minutes and Andy Kerr headed home a second 20 minutes later. Steve Shaughnessy pulled a goal back for the Linnets just before half-time. Just before the hour mark Steve Thompson headed home a Steve Guppy corner to make it 3\u20131 and Wycombe missed a number of chances to extend their lead. Dave Carroll made it 4\u20131 with a minute left when Runcorn goalkeeper Arthur Williams allowed his shot to slip through his fingers. There was a wonderful gesture as injured captain Glyn Creaser went up to collect the trophy. Wycombe Wanderers had achieved a glorious non-league double and there were more great scenes of celebration in the town the following day as the team enjoyed an open-top bus parade.", "As he did the previous summer, O'Neill kept faith in his squad. Just three of his players, Glyn Creaser, Mark West and Steve Thompson remained part-time as the club full-time for the first time in its history. The Football League imposed very stringent financial conditions on the club, after experiences with Maidstone United and Barnet  The fixture list was also rather unhelpful, as the opening fixture of the 1993\u201394 season would be away at Carlisle United. However, more than 1,500 Chairboys and girls made the long journey and were part of a 7,752 crowd that witnessed history in the making. The newcomers endured a torrid opening 20 minutes, Rod Thomas giving the Cumbrians the lead. However, the Wanderers soon found their feet and equalised three minutes before half-time. The first Football League goal in the club's history was an own-goal scored by Chris Curran: with 18 minutes Steve Guppy became the first Wycombe player to score in the Football League when he turned the ball home at the far post; however, Curran made up for his error ten minutes later by firing home an equaliser and the game finished 2\u20132. A Keith Scott goal gave the Blues their first ever victory in the Football League, a 1\u20130 win over Chester City at Adams Park. The league newcomers made a great start, remaining unbeaten in their first eight league matches. After beating Leyton Orient 3\u20130 on aggregate in the first round of the Football League Cup the team came agonisingly close to knocking out Premier League Coventry City in the second round. A 3\u20130 first leg deficit was overturned and a Jason Cousins free-kick gave the Wanderers a 4\u20130 lead early in extra time. Goals from Steve Morgan and a deflected Phil Babb effort saw the Sky Blues through 5\u20134 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "1994 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Neither side made any changes to their personnel during the interval and Wycombe drew level two minutes into the second with a goal from Garner.  Titterton's pass found the Wycombe striker who ran past Squires and struck past Woods.  Preston's Gareth Ainsworth was then booked in the 49th minute.  Eight minutes later, a four-man play from Wycombe concluded with Guppy's cross being passed by Garner to Carroll who scored at the far post to make it 3\u20132.  On 61 minutes, Glyn Creaser became the first Wycombe player to be shown the yellow card.  Eleven minutes later Carroll scored his second after beating Moyes  out from goal to make it 4\u20132.  Garner was then booked in the 75th minute.  No further goals were scored and Wycombe were promoted to the Second Division at their first attempt.", "|LB || 5 ||Glyn Creaser "]}]}}
