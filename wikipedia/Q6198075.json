His television criticism work initially appeared as a column under the alias of \"Tapehead\". These were considered surrealistic reviews of current television, similar to the work of Victor Lewis-Smith and Charlie Brooker. He later work specifically on soap operas under \"Soaphead\". He also wrote for The Mail on Sunday's \"Night on Day\" section on soaps.In 2001, with the departure of Charlie Catchpole from the Daily Mirror to the Daily Express, Shelley became the new television critic for the Mirror. He continued to write for the Mirror under its \"Shelley Vision\" column until 2011. Since 2013, he writes as a television review columnist for the Daily Mail.\nIn addition, Shelley has written for magazines such as Esquire magazine, Details and BLITZ and was featured in NME.His collection of Tapehead columns was published as \"Interference: Tapehead vs. Television\" by Atlantic Books in 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ken Barlow", "response": ["Ken has a reputation for being boring. The British band Half Man Half Biscuit highlighted this point in their 2001 song \"Lark Descending\", comparing him unfavourably with a member of the US underground music scene, with the lyric: \"I could have been like Lou Barlow, but I'm more like Ken Barlow\". Despite Ken being fictional, critic Jim Shelley, writing for the Daily Mirror in 2009, labelled Ken \"the most boring man you could ever meet\". Roache sued for libel in 1990 when The Sun newspaper ran an article branding Ken boring and making allegations that Roache was disliked among the cast of Coronation Street. Roache said to the jury at the court case, \"I felt extremely distressed. I could not believe those words had been written, that they had raked into my past. I broke out in a sweat. [...] They were saying that I was not doing my job, that I was a joke to the storyline writers, which is not true\". Roache added in regard to Ken, \"If people find someone who has had 23 girlfriends and three wives boring, that's fine by me.\" Roache won the case and was awarded \u00a350,000; however, he was forced to pay legal costs, which bankrupted him. Brian Viner has suggested that it is remarkable that Ken has been labelled boring in spite of the many plots he has been involved with over the years. Brian Viner said, \"It is easy enough to see, despite the extraordinary number of broken relationships and personal crises in his wake, why Ken tends not to make the pulse race when he opens his mouth. After all, he usually opens it only to drink halves of bitter, or to say something sensible or worthy. For 50 years he has been the nearest thing Weatherfield, the fictional area of Greater Manchester where Coronation Street is located, has had to a social conscience.\""]}, {"page": "Ricky Gervais", "response": ["In July 2007, following Gervais's appearance at the memorial concert for the Princess of Wales, The Guardian ran a column by Daily Mirror television critic Jim Shelley entitled \"Call Me Crazy...

The following week, The Guardian noted that Gervais had responded with \"an exhilaratingly foul-mouthed tirade\" on his website, concluding with the sentence \"yes I am resting on my fucking laurels you cunt!\" In this video, Gervais mocked Jim Shelley typing the words \"resting on his laurels\" as Gervais jokingly lashed out by stating that he was resting on his laurels and that he was not going to make another show for television, quipping: \"What's the point?

However, Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror was highly critical of Chrissie, calling her \"the ludicrous Lady MacBeth wannabe\", and felt her departure was ennabling EastEnders to move forward.

Following his casting, he said in an interview with the Daily Record that he was a long-time fan of the series, commenting that it was \"great to be joining an established show with a great bunch of people.\" In contrast, Neil Bonner of the Liverpool Daily Post quoted him as stating that he had never seen an episode of the show in its then-16-year history. MacCorkindale was surprised to be offered the role of Harper given the many years that he had spent working in North America, but having settled in Exmoor found Bristol to be an accessible production base. MacCorkindale was \"never too comfortable as a young actor\" and \"always felt that [his] best time in the business would be around [the age of 50].\" MacCorkindale commented that he \"loved [his] time on Casualty,\" and spent time researching all the medical terminology that his character used to ensure that he understood it. He also appeared as Harper in the Casualty spin-off series Holby City and Casualty@Holby City. Many reviewers were disparaging of MacCorkindale's performances in Casualty: Rupert Smith of The Guardian deemed MacCorkindale \"fantastically wooden\", while fellow Guardian journalists Sarah Dempster and Jim Shelley commented on MacCorkindale's \"loud\" delivery of his lines. Shelley described the character of Harper as a \"human Foghorn Leghorn\", while according to Dempster, Casualty was \"above all [...] about Simon MacCorkindale, shouting.

However, commenting on the re-write of the plot strand because of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, Banks-Smith asserted that it had \"never made much sense, even by soap standards\", using the depiction of Claire as an example of the show's over-embellished writing: \"Even in a tragic episode, the writing in Coronation Street is like a stone skipping across deep water. The script, like a Victorian pub, is so embellished with grapes and roses that you know the stonemason is just indulging himself.

We also love her frenemy-ness with Zainab.\" Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror questioned the credulity of the storyline which saw Lucas hold Denise hostage having faked her suicide. He quoted Denise's line: \"Another thing I don't get. Why am I supposed to have killed myself? What 'reason' did I have?!\" observing: \"NO REASON of course. The writers hadn't even made one up \u2013 although that didn't stop Walford CID quickly deciding Denise had killed Owen and Trina even though they had no evidence and she had a watertight alibi.\" Nathan Bevan of the Wales on Sunday also deemed the storyline far-fetched, commenting: \"she'd been kept prisoner in the basement of the abandoned house next door [...] and no one heard her screaming for help through the walls? What part of the East End is this?\" Inside Soap stated in January 2011 that whilst Denise headed up the Fox family, they were \"a right bunch of miseries\" and opined they would party with lively sister Kim and only let Denise come if she \"promises to crack a smile\". The magazine published a feature about Denise in April 2013, naming the scene where Lucas told Denise she had 'died', her \"classic scene\". Mark James Lowe called Denise \"fiery\" and when reviewing Denise's time on the show said, \"Denise has never had it easy both blokes.

He tormented Jacqui Dixon, toyed with Lindsey Corkhill's affections and made Sue Sullivan take a tumble of some scaffolding to her death.\" Another Guardian writer assessed \"from his early days as a cheeky youngster at number 5, Barry Grant developed into a money obsessed 'scally'. By the late 1980s he had become the villain at the head of a gangland empire.\" Lizzie Francke (also The Guardian) said that Barry has a \"famous scowl\" and branded him a \"fickle\" character. Discussing his alleged walk out, Francke added \"if Usher wants to bargain with Redmond and co, at least there is the huge popularity of Barry in his favour.\" In 1991, Jim Shelley praised Brookside for returning to its classic story telling. He commented that the show \"has shown sign of revival to returning to what it is good at (violent, tragi-comic crime stories), with the escapades of Barry Grant and the hapless Jimmy Corkhill.\" Shelley was later delighted with Barry's 1997 return and joked that it called for a street party and a public holiday. He quipped that by the end of the episode, Barry had already uttered his famous catchphrases (such as \"You Wha?\" and \"You're jokin' aren'tya\") and womanised a regular female character.

He later said that he would bet money on Katie being the character \"next to snap\" and go on a murder spree. Their colleague Tina Ogle wrote that it was \"no wonder Katie developed an eating disorder\" because she \"slobs around, depressed and out of work.\" Jim Shelley criticised Katie's hairstyle, joking that it was inspired by \"Adolf Hitler joining The Human League\".

Shelley also branded her \"a pouting (panting) big-chested blonde\" and was happy that she returned to \"torment\" Max. They called Susannah and Patricia's feud \"the battle of the blondes\" and a \"Bouquet of Barbed Wire style sub-plot that was \"side tracked\" by other stories. Polly Vernon, also from The Guardian believed that fictional characters representing the British middle-class, such as Susannah and Max do not make good television. Another critic declared that while Susannah and Greg were a \"charming couple\", their relationship has \"quickly descended into rather desperate innuendo - like Carry on Plumbing.\" Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror accused the character of being empty headed.

He later deplored \"the fact is, Brookside is literally not worth watching at the moment. Sammy, after eight years out of the series, has come back to re-enact her performance as an unconvincing alcoholic trying to cop off with Max.\" Shelley also criticised Brookside's portrayal of marriage and opined that Sammy and Owen were one of the show's only happy couples. Their colleague Gareth McLean reviewed Sammy's wedding episode and called it the \"disintegration of the Rogers family\" and called it both \"painful and poignant\". McLean observed that Sammy and Jacqui's feud was reminiscent of the class war between the Corkhills and Grants featured in 1980s episodes of Brookside. McLean believed that Sammy's pursuit of Max was over the top and joked that she should have got a T-shirt with the slogan \"I'm Sammy. Fly me.\"  He added, \"a sledgehammer to crack a nut?

The Guardian critic Gareth McLean was critical of the episode, writing: \"Now here's an idea for another Holby spin-off - one set in the hospital's STD clinic. Of course, given the ceaseless intra-departmental shagging that goes on in that hospital, there might be too much crossover with existing shows, with not a look-in for characters who aren't actually on staff.

Abra covering up that he was operating on his arms-dealer father. Maddy hiding the fact she killed her junkie sister's daughter. And secret cokehead Jesus Of Nazareth (Robert Powell) keeping quiet about counselling Elliot's son for heroin addiction. Oh yeah, and in Casualty, in Holby's A&E department, nurse Ruth Winters secretly fixed her dad's breathalyser test.

He made his first appearance on 12 September 2008. It was reported in July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a child sexual abuse storyline involving Bianca's adopted daughter Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). BBC News described the plot as an ongoing \"predatory paedophile storyline\", noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera. The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded the plot strand \"one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted\", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it to be a \"new low\" for EastEnders. Tony sexually abuses Whitney, and begins grooming her school-friend Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan), before his predatory nature is uncovered and he is arrested for his crimes. Tony appeared between 12 September and 12 December 2008 and returned in December 2009 to stand trial.

Although they find it difficult to communicate they get on well and hit it off in the quirkiest way possible.\" She assessed that Alice was initially nervous of the relationship as: \"She's very naive, quite like a little girl in many ways. She's never had a proper relationship and is still a virgin.
