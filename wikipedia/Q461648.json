That is the sum and substance of the worth of running.  Having said that, I would venture to guess that very few runners either think or dwell on such enhancement. Their energies, their thoughts, are directed to times, PRs (personal records), races, mileage, gear, and the eternal search for the perfect shoe.  I plead guilty to having done much of that when I was competing.  Maybe the realization and appreciation of enhancement dawn only after a person has suffered the loss of running and racing.  While active, we're just too damned obsessed with the inconsequential to recognize how privileged we are, how running and racing enhance our lives.  One thing for sure, if you lose running and racing, you had better be able to devise ways to compensate because you will have a huge void to fill when you come to realize how running enhanced your life.\"  Paul Reese, 2004", "* 1993, Ten Million Steps: The Incredible Journey of Paul Reese, Who Ran Across America--A Marathon a Day for 124 Days--At Age 73, High Country Books, ", "* FFSac.com - 'Paul Reese Memorial Clarksburg Country Run', Fleet Feet", "* KeokeeBooks.com - 'Go East Old Man, Chapter 2, Oregon:  On the Road Again' (excerpt), Paul Reese, Joe Henderson (1997)", "* MarathonAndBeyond - 'Coping With the Inevitable: Aging and Diminished Physical Capacity Are Part of Life.
