For example, in the United Kingdom researchers have informed MPs that the government was using the Hinkley Point C project to cross-subsidise the UK military's nuclear-related activity by maintaining nuclear skills. In support of that, researchers from the University of Sussex Andy Stirling and Phil Johnstone stated that the costs of the Trident nuclear submarine programme would be prohibitive without \u201can effective subsidy from electricity consumers to military nuclear infrastructure\u201d."]}, {"page": "Stephen Thomas (professor)", "response": ["*Andy Stirling"]}]}}
