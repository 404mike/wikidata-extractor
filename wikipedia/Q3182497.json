An outside inquiry is proposed, a suggestion supported by the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).  The RUC's Sir John Hermon is not happy; but is mollified that it is to him the inquiry would report, with the RUC responsible for the implementation of any findings.  John Stalker, deputy chief constable of the Greater Manchester force, is recommended to head the inquiry.  Stalker is contacted, and assured that the minister wants an in-depth inquiry, and any findings will be acted on \u2212 a telephone call that Stalker records.  Arriving in Northern Ireland, Stalker and his deputy DCS John Thorburn meet Hermon in an otherwise empty golf club restaurant.  Over brandies after their meal Hermon warns Stalker that there is a shoot-to-kill policy all right \u2212 one carried on by the terrorists; and it is Hermon, not Stalker, who will decide what gets referred to the DPP.  They are not in Manchester, they are in the jungle now, and should be prepared accordingly.  Stalker and his team are shown to what will be their offices, in an old hotel that the RUC now also uses for band practice, and adjacent to an RUC firing range.  As they start to move in, a reel-to-reel tape recorder is capturing their every word.", "Thorburn and Stalker question a young RUC constable who confirms he had been monitoring the tapes when Tighe and McCauley had been shot in the hayshed. But, he tells them, he cannot discuss the contents of the tape unless instructed to do so by his senior officers, under the terms of the Official Secrets Act.  Stalker asks Hermon for the tape; Hermon says it is not his to give \u2212 it belongs to MI5.  Thorburn asks to interview the informant.  Hermon says it is out of the question \u2212 the informer belongs to Special Branch.  Stalker reminds him that it is Special Branch he is there to investigate.  Stalker informs Hermon as a parting shot that in connection with his inquiry, he will be wanting to interview the RUC's most senior officers, including Sir John himself, under formal caution.  Back at the inquiry offices, Stalker delivers an angry appraisal of the situation to his team.  Special Branch have been acting as a firm within a firm; it is like some death squads out of a banana republic \u2212 well not any longer.  They are there to ensure the rule of law; they cannot descend to the terrorists' level; and Stalker is going to find out how high up it goes.  All the while his words are being followed and recorded by RUC Special Branch.  Stalker goes to see MI5 at their Gower Street headquarters in London.  The MI5 officer is unctuous, telling Stalker that MI5 will not stand in his way, and wishing him good luck; but as Stalker leaves, the officer makes a call: \"We may have a slight problem\".  Stalker is not the only one who had been on the move.  The Detective Inspector from RUC Special Branch has gone to Belfast Airport, then talked to Flanagan at the Police College, and finally seen a prisoner in a northern English jail.  The prisoner, David Burton, is visited by two detectives from Greater Manchester Police.  He can help them with the Quality Street Gang, he tells them: they should keep their eyes on a businessman called Kevin Taylor.  And why has Taylor never been successfully investigated?  Because he has a protector... John Stalker.  Stalker and his team interview Flanagan, who seems blas\u00e9, even enjoying the situation.  Of course he had met the SSU men to debrief them: this was policy, they had to get the story straight.  The process had been like a \"Chinese Parliament\", a consensus had emerged, though no one person could be said to be responsible.  He denies that the unit's \"firepower, speed, aggression\" equated to a shoot-to-kill policy, something which had not existed, it had been a media invention.  On Kinnego, he vehemently denies Thorburn and Stalker's assertion that he had knowingly let the explosives out of the hayshed.  But he accepts that evidence was tampered with to protect the source \u2212 in the interests of national security: it was policy.  Stalker calls it perversion of justice, and Thorburn wants to know how high up it went.  But for Flanagan, he and Stalker are on the same side, even if they play by different rulebooks.  Stalker may think they're like a \"death squad, from some banana republic, out of control\"; but this is the only way they can maintain control.  They could take the bandits out, all of them, in one operation \"if that was the way we worked\"; so where's the shoot-to-kill policy?  Stalker presses about the tape; but about this Flanagan cannot answer \u2212 in fact, he will \"have to talk to somebody before he can answer any more questions\".  In Manchester, the two detectives present their findings to a senior officer.  He in turn knocks on the door of the chief constable.", "*Jack Shepherd, as DCC John Stalker, Greater Manchester Police", "The programme then showed a briefing which played on the men's feelings for their colleagues murdered at Kinnego, and emphasised that Eugene Toman, Sean Burns, and Martin McCauley were the men believed \"from an impeccable source\" to be responsible, before knowingly concluding: \"When you get the word from E4a, I want a Vehicle Control Point set up and I want these men stopped.
