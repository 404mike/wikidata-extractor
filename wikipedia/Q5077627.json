Binns was the first director of the New York State School of Clayworking and Ceramics, currently called the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University. He began his position in 1900 and retired in 1931. His work included authorship of several books on the history and practice of pottery. Some of his more notable students included Arthur Eugene Baggs, William Victor Bragdon, R. Guy Cowan, Maija Grotell and Elizabeth Overbeck. This has led Binns to be called \"the father of American studio ceramics\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New York State College of Ceramics", "response": ["Charles Fergus Binns, a British ceramist, served as the first Director of the school, after completing a career at Royal Worcester Porcelain Works.

In addition, American folk pottery of the southeastern United States was seen as an American contribution to studio pottery. University programs at Ohio State University, under the direction of Arthur Eugene Baggs in 1928 and under Glen Lukens in 1936 at the University of Southern California, began training ceramic students in presenting clay ware as art.

She clashed with Binns on his teaching methodology, preferring the potter's wheel to Binns's constructive method. Wheel thrown ceramics were not common in the United States at the time; American potters commonly used coiling, slip casting, or slab building. Grotell, and other European \u00e9migr\u00e9s like Gertrude and Otto Natzler and Marguerite Wildenhain, were largely responsible for bringing European wheel thrown techniques to the United States. Her skill with the potter's wheel proved beneficial for Grotell; she was often asked to demonstrate the technique and could easily find work teaching throughout New York City. In 1938, Grotell took a position as the head of the ceramics program at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Grotell was hesitant to take the position at Cranbrook. She had initially been declined for the post because the school preferred a male instructor. When the position was offered to her the following year, Grotell feared she could lose her independence as a single woman and credit for her success would be attributed to her male colleagues."]}, {"page": "List of Alfred University people", "response": ["*Charles Fergus Binns, author, educator and \"the father of American studio ceramics\"Carney, Margaret.
