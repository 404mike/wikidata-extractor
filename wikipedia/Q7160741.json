For 40 years, her teams appeared in the Come Dancing TV programme.Peggy choreographed  a dance sequence for a Beatles video (\"Your Mother Should Know\"), and the tango for Rudolph Nureyev in the film Valentino (1977). She was a choreographer for the Burn the Floor dance show, which combined ballroom dances with modern ideas. More than most things she enjoyed appearing on the BBC's children's show Blue Peter, where she brought young dancers from her classes to demonstrate. She was the subject of the TV show This Is Your Life in 1993.In 2004, Spencer became President of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.

It was filmed on 24 September, at the end of a six-day shoot at RAF West Malling, a Royal Air Force base in Kent. McCartney had intended to shoot the scene at Shepperton Studios, outside London, but the Beatles failed to appreciate that film studios needed to be booked in advance. Tony Bramwell, the film's production manager, recalled having a staircase assembled on scaffolding inside a disused aircraft hangar for the sequence, which was the most elaborate set piece in the film. Around 160 dancers from Peggy Spencer's formation dancing team and 24 female RAF cadets were hired as extras. The formation dancers were regulars on the TV show Come Dancing and were brought in by bus from Birmingham, Cardiff and Newcastle for the shoot. According to Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees, McCartney got the idea for the Beatles' costumes from seeing him perform in concert with the Bee Gees, dressed all in white. The band rehearsed their dance routine for most of the day but the generators failed just as filming got underway. Gavrik Losey, a production assistant on the film, said that the dancers were \"bribed\" with Beatles autographs into staying late while the generators were repaired."]}, {"page": "Margaret Ann Hull", "response": ["#redirect Peggy Spencer"]}, {"page": "Diane Barron", "response": ["Diane started dancing in 1953, and turned professional in 1962, reaching the finals of the British Championships a number of times.

This small band of specialists worked to establish an examination system and syllabus for both amateur and professional dancers. Walter Laird and Peggy Spencer, were other important members, among others, added a few years later. The syllabus which was finally agreed in 1955 has been the foundation of teaching and competition in the Latin American dances ever since. This work naturally included the samba, paso doble and jive as well, but it was the composition of the rumba which was critical. After further visits to Cuba in the early 1950s, when Doris Lavelle and James Arnell accompanied Pierre, the cha cha cha was added to make the five Latin American dances that are still the basis of teaching and competition today in the international dance community."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Spencer", "response": ["* Peggy Spencer (1920\u20132016), British ballroom dancer and choreographer"]}, {"page": "Lyndon Wainwright", "response": [":\"In the early 50s Lyndon & Felicia were well known for their wonderful cabaret \u2013 they didn't follow the normal trend \u2013 they studied all types of Latin American rhythms.
