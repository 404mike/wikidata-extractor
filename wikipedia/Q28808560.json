Instead of playing it safe and avoiding mistakes, he said, Birt transformed output and embraced the internet, and rebuilt relationships with government, business and the public. Media commentator Steve Hewlett, Birt's former colleague and friend, suggested in 2012 that it might be time for the BBC \"to bring in Birt 2.0\".

There he was, grey man with a job for life, half a million pounds in salary and, because he had been at the BBC so long without ever leaving, an uncapped two-thirds final salary pension entitlement and no obvious market rate comparator to justify such riches. It was very easy to put the question, as even many lower ranking BBC staff did \u2013 who else would pay Mark Byford \u00a3500,000 and for what? \u2013 knowing there was no very good answer.\" However, the remainder of that article, written by media commentator Steve Hewlett, suggested that his presence might be missed greatly at the BBC. \"He made things happen and by common consent brought a firm moral sense to everything he did, rising above his own particular interests.\" It went on to highlight how he was a stabilising influence on Director-General Mark Thompson. That opinion appeared highly prophetic in the light of the two major Newsnight scandals \u2013 concerning Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine respectively \u2013 which engulfed the BBC within 18 months of Byford's departure. Both of those incidents led to widespread adverse criticism of high level management of journalism within the BBC and were surrounded by suggestions that the Director-General of the day was not sufficiently informed about issues highly significant for the BBC's reputation."]}, {"page": "Tudor Grange Academy, Solihull", "response": ["*Steve Hewlett, print and broadcast journalist"]}, {"page": "Sheffield DocFest", "response": ["In 2005 DocFest attracted more than 600 mostly-UK delegates and enjoyed almost 9000 screening and session admissions.
