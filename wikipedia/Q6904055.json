After the moot hall fell into a state of disrepair, a second market hall, which was also arcaded and featured a clock tower, was commissioned by the James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon in 1684. In the late 1850s, following complaints that the 17th century market hall was inadequate for large public meetings, civic leaders decided to acquire the old building from Montagu Bertie, 6th Earl of Abingdon, to demolish it and to erect a new town hall, financed by public subscription, on the same site as part of the town's celebrations for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The old market hall clock, which had originally been made for Rycote chapel in 1577, was removed from the clock tower before it was demolished and donated to St Catherine's Church at Towersey."]}]}}
