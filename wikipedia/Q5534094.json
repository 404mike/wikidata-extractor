He was a lower-order batsman and a wicketkeeper.\nClayton was a regular first-team player in every season in which he played first-class cricket and he was at or near to the top of the wicketkeepers' lists for most dismissals each year. But his abrasive personality did not endear him to county committees \u2013 or to his county captain at Somerset \u2013 and he left first-class cricket at the age of 29.\nHe died on 19 September 2018, in Delph.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Statham", "response": ["The section of Warwick Road which runs past Old Trafford was renamed Brian Statham Way in his honour and the south end of the ground, opposite the Pavilion End, is called the Brian Statham End.

He was the reserve wicketkeeper to Harold Stephenson at Somerset in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and his first-class cricket career was dictated largely by Stephenson's state of health. So 43 of Eele's 54 first-class matches came in two seasons: 1958, when Stephenson was injured for the second half of the season, and 1964, when Stephenson was able to play only three times. When Stephenson left the county somewhat unwillingly at the end of the 1964 season, Somerset recruited Geoff Clayton of Lancashire as his wicketkeeping replacement.

Mike Denness and Brian Luckhurst opened the batting for Kent. Denness began by scoring quickly, accounting for 50 of the team's 78 runs after just over an hour of the match, before being caught behind by Geoff Clayton off the bowling of Bill Alley. John Woodcock, writing in The Times described Denness' contribution as being \"the one innings of quality\" in an \"ordinary\" match. Luckhurst played a patient innings, and shared a second-wicket partnership of 60 with Shepherd. Once their top-order batsmen were out, Kent collapsed from 138 runs for the loss of one wicket to 150 for seven. Cowdrey, Dixon, Stuart Leary and Alan Brown were all dismissed for scores of one or less. A late partnership between Alan Knott and Alan Ealham, who scored 21 and 17 respectively before both were run out, helped to push Kent's score on to 193 all out after 59.4 overs, two deliveries short of the full 60-over innings. Somerset's bowling was led by Alley, who took three wickets and conceded 22 runs from his 12 overs. Woodcock described his bowling during the match as being of \"the utmost cunning\". Somerset's other bowlers fared less well; Roy Palmer also collected three wickets, but was expensive, conceding nearly five runs per over.", "In Somerset's batting innings, Woodcock suggested that the team needed just one top-class performance to grant them victory after restricting Kent's score well late in their innings. Peter Robinson, opening with Roy Virgin, played well to score 48 runs, but that was the highest score that any Somerset player would manage. Each of the other top-order batsmen made starts, but none could convert them to big scores; Virgin got 17, Mervyn Kitchen 15 and Terry Barwell 24. Alley, identified by The Times as a key player for Somerset before the match, only scored one run before being caught behind square on the legside by Brown from the bowling of Shepherd. Graham Burgess provided some runs in the middle-order, but lacked support from his batting partners; of the five batsmen who were below him in the batting order, only Geoff Clayton added more than two runs to the score, and he only totalled eight. Derek Underwood finished as Kent's leading wicket-taker in the match, though his three wickets came late in the innings, as he had been held back against the top-order, as Cowdrey was concerned he might concede too many runs. Somerset were all out for 161 runs, with 54.5 overs bowled, giving Kent a 32-run victory.", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Geoff Clayton  b Bill Alley || 50", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Geoff Clayton  b Roy Palmer || 1", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Geoff Clayton "]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Geoff Clayton, 80, English cricketer (Lancashire, Somerset)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2018", "response": ["*Geoff Clayton, 80, English cricketer (Lancashire, Somerset).Somerset mourn the passing of Geoff Clayton"]}]}}
