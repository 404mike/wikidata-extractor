At age 18 (in 1958), he wrote the allegorical fantasy novel The Golden Barge. This remained unpublished until 1980, when it was issued by Savoy Books with an introduction by M. John Harrison. At 19,  Moorcock worked on Sexton Blake Library (serial pulp fiction featuring Sexton Blake, the poor man's Sherlock Holmes) . Writing ever since, he has produced a huge volume of work. His first story in New Worlds was \"Going Home\" (1958; with Barrington J. Bayley). \"The Sundered Worlds\", a 57-page novella published in the November 1962 number of Science Fiction Adventures, edited by John Carnell, became, with its sequel \"The Blood Red Game\" from the same magazine, the basis for his 190-page paperback debut SF novel three years later, The Sundered Worlds (Compact Books, 1965; in the U.S., Paperback Library, 1966)."]}, {"page": "Philip K.
