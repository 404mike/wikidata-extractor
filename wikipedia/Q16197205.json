In the late 1990s his art practice shifted from painting to music, initially with the band Rooney and their three experimental lo-fi punk pop albums about everyday life. His work later focussed on music within gallery installations, performances and video works.His art works often explore the difficulties inherent in the representation of 'place'. The curator Claire Doherty wrote that: \"Rooney asserts [the] occupation of place through real and fictional occurrences, acknowledging the overlooked and proposing the equal status of urban myth and lived experience.\"Rooney was the winner of Art Prize North in 2003, the Northern Art Prize in 2008, and the Morton Award for Lens Based Work in 2012. His works have been purchased for the Arts Council Collection and through the Contemporary Art Society Acquisitions Scheme.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Melling, Merseyside", "response": ["* Paul Rooney (artist), visual and sound artist, grew up here."]}, {"page": "Edinburgh College of Art", "response": ["* Paul Rooney, artist"]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Paul Rooney: Visual and sound artist."]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Paul Rooney (born 1967)"]}, {"page": "Site Gallery", "response": ["Site Gallery exhibits work by nationally and internationally based artists, commissioned new work or UK premieres, of international standard as well as emergent talent.

Initially a solo project by Paul Rooney, an artist and musician, the project became a gigging band when Colin Cromer and Ian S Jackson joined in 1999 prior to the band's first and only John Peel session that year. The project ended in 2002 when Paul Rooney decided to focus on other performance projects and gallery works. ", "Artist Paul Rooney recorded the first Rooney EP (this is not the US band of the same name), Got Up Late, in October 1997 in Newcastle-under-Lyme, using a mini-disc four-track recorder with Paul Rooney on all instruments and vocals. Initially only five copies were self-released on Common Culture Records. The lo-fi music incorporated sometimes humorous \u2014 but often unsettling \u2014 spoken-sung lyrics describing everyday, mundane activities and observations, an approach which was consistent across all Rooney releases.Bracewell, Michael.

He referred to the history (real and fictionalized) of the band Rooney in a number of his artworks and stories, references which usually centred on singer Dermot Bucknall from the pre-1997 period of the band. In 2006 comedian and writer Stewart Lee curated the Rooney track Into the Lens for the CD/book The Topography of Chance, which also included Mark E Smith, Derek Bailey and Simon Munnery. In 2014 the three Rooney albums were made available digitally on iTunes, Spotify and other streaming platforms, and the Rooney Peel session was repeated in 2016 on Gideon Coe's BBC 6 Music show.
