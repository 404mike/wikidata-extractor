These cultural ecologists were concerned with how human groups made decisions about how they use their natural environment. They were particularly concerned with the question of agricultural intensification, refining the competing models of Thomas Malthus and Boserup. Notable cultural ecologists in this second tradition include Harold Brookfield and Billie Lee Turner II. Starting in the 1980s, cultural ecology came under criticism from political ecology. Political ecologists charged that cultural ecology ignored the connections between the local-scale systems they studied and the global political economy. Today few geographers self-identify as cultural ecologists, but ideas from cultural ecology have been adopted and built on by political ecology, land change science, and sustainability science."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* Harold Brookfield (PhD 1950), Emeritus Professor, Australian National University"]}, {"page": "List of Australian National University people", "response": ["*Harold Brookfield, academic"]}, {"page": "List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1973", "response": ["* Harold Brookfield, Professor of Human Geography, Australian National University."]}, {"page": "Minchenden Grammar School", "response": ["* Prof. Harold Brookfield (born 1926), scholar of rural development, Australian National University"]}, {"page": "List of non-fiction environmental writers", "response": ["| Harold Brookfield || M || 1926\u2013 || British and Australian || Rural development, family farms || Cultivating Biodiversity: Understanding, Analysing and Using Agricultural Diversity "]}, {"page": "Harold Chillingworth Brookfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harold Brookfield"]}, {"page": "Harold C.
