Their estimate was that only four seats would have been Conservative without the Referendum Party standing. For this reason, Butler and Kavanagh stated that the Referendum Party \"had only a limited effect on the Conservatives' fortunes\". On employing aggregate constituency data, Ian McAllister and Donley T. Studlar disagreed, arguing that the Referendum Party had a greater impact on the Conservatives than previous research suggested. They argued that the Referendum Party cost the Conservatives an average of 3.4% of the vote. Their analysis further suggested that there were 16 seats where the involvement of the Referendum Party directly cost the Conservative candidate their victory, and a further three where it was a contributing factor to the Conservatives' failure."]}, {"page": "St Lawrence College, Ramsgate", "response": ["* Michael Steed, Political scientist"]}, {"page": "Leeds North East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Joseph had a relatively safe seat at first but his majority fell in the elections of the 1960s.
