He played as a fullback.\nHe had 26 caps for Ireland, scoring 5 tries and 2 conversions, 25 points in aggregate. He played club rugby for London Irish and Harlequins. Staples alongside club colleague Simon Geoghegan also represented Connacht in the Irish Provincial Championship, which at the time served as trial games for selection to the national team.\nStaples played at the 1991 Rugby World Cup and at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. He played 5 times at the Five Nations, in 1991, 1992, 1995, 1996 and 1997.\nDuring his playing career Staples weighed 82 kg and was 1.88m in height.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Connacht Rugby", "response": ["In spite of the increased production line of native talent, Connacht continues to rely on its traditional policy of bringing in players from outside its jurisdiction that have failed to progress to their senior provincial team to help make up its playing numbers. Examples of this from the amateur era include Robbie McGrath and Victor Costello, both of whom went on to represent Ireland. This trend has continued in the professional era with the record-holder for points scored, Ian Keatley, and leading try-scorer Matt Healy both being from Dublin, while Munster-native players like Se\u00e1n Cronin and Ultan Dillane have earned Ireland caps while playing for the team. Connacht has also tended to give opportunities to foreign-born players who qualify for Ireland through heritage. This relationship was codified by the IRFU in the 1980s when English-born players were mandated to represent Connacht in the Interprovincial Championship. In the amateur era, this saw the likes of Simon Geoghegan, John O'Driscoll and Jim Staples represent Connacht, while since the game has turned professional, the likes of Michael Swift, Mike McCarthy and Kieran Marmion have all reached over 100 caps for the team."]}, {"page": "James Staples", "response": ["* Jim Staples (born 1965), rugby union footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Ireland national rugby union players", "response": ["|Jim Staples\t"]}]}}
