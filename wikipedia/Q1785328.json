In a December 1990 issue of British gaming magazine The One, The One interviewed team members from Vivid Image for information regarding The First Samurai's development in a pre-release interview. The First Samurai's samurai theme was first conceived by graphic artist Paul 'Dokk' Docherty as a 'random thought' while watching the 1954 monster film Them!, and Docherty expresses that \"At the time we were in the middle of designing another game but we weren't very happy with it.\" The One purported that the title The First Samurai's correlation to The Last Ninja is \"purely coincidental\". Docherty's proposal of a samurai theme was received by Vivid Image as \"exactly what they were looking for\", and Docherty states that \"We wanted something fairly mystical so that we could put in lots of special effects. Samurai also have a very strong sense of honour - that fitted in with our plot.\" Mev Dinc, The First Samurai's project manager, expressed that programmer Raffaele Cecco was invited to the project \"because he's not only a very good programmer, he also comes up with lots of really good ideas. If I suggest one thing, he usually comes back with three.\" The First Samurai's development was described by The One as \"an ongoing creative process in which everyone is encouraged to participate\", and Dinc expressed that \"Deciding on sprites and backgrounds that everybody is happy with can be time-consuming. We don't argue, we just have constructive discussions.\"", "User-friendly controls were a priority in the game's development, and John Twiddy, The First Samurai's map editor, stated that \"You have to be able to pick up the joystick and just play the game.\" The balance between easy-to-learn controls and allowing the player an array of different attacks was an important factor in The First Samurai's design, and Twiddy stated that \"The main thing is to get lots of manoeuvres in there. They're all effective so ultimately you don't actually need to know how you've done each one.\" The animations in response to the player's inputs were partially inspired by arcade games, and Twiddy states that \u201dIn some arcade games, when your opponent's in a certain position you end up grabbing them and throwing them over your shoulder. It looks like you're doing something spectacular but in fact it's the computer showing standard joystick moves in different ways on screen. That's a feature we'd like to include.\" The First Samurai was the first 16-bit game that Raffaele Cecco worked on, and he spent the first two months on the project learning how to program for the Amiga, stating that \"Obviously I couldn't use any old sprite handling or scrolling routines because I didn't have any. I've had to start everything from scratch.\" The First Samurai was programmed on a 386 PC using the Programmer's Development System (PDS) developed by Fruad Katon. Vivid Image deliberately chose a \"fairly long\" development period according to The One, and Cecco expressed that \"We want to make certain there's plenty of time at the end for tweaking. This is the sort of game where it all comes down to how many enemies there are and where they're positioned.\""]}, {"page": "Cop out", "response": ["* Cop-Out (video game), a 1986 video game by Raffaele Cecco"]}, {"page": "Equinox (1986 video game)", "response": ["Equinox was programmed by Raffaele Cecco and Chris Hinsley.

The former, published in 1994, was designed after Super Mario Kart and incorporated original characters, including one based on Nasreddin Hodja, a historical satirist well known in Turkey. Dinc had envisioned a 3D adventure game for the PlayStation revolving around Hodja, which he was to develop with Raffaele Cecco, the Rowlands brothers, and others. However, the game was never released and led to Dinc falling out with some of those involved. S.C.A.R.S. was released in 1998. According to Dinc, the game's graphics, including the race track designs, were produced in-house by Ubi Soft, making them \"too short and too difficult\", which \"ruined the game\". Also in 1998, Vivid Image began work on Actor, a 3D game demo, using the Dynamic Toolkit by MathEngine, an Oxford software company. The demo was first shown off in 2000 as part of a promotion of the Pentium 4 line of central processing units. A \"mystery-and-adventure game\" also called Actor was to be released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. By 2000, Dinc felt as though he had reached the peak of his career in the UK. He returned to Turkey, which at the time lacked a professional games industry, and believed that establishing a games scene there would make him \"feel proud again\". Vivid Image became formally based in Istanbul and developed Dual Blades for the Game Boy Advance, published by Metro3D in October 2002."]}]}}
