To a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian Quentin Skinner, jurist Cass Sunstein, and political philosopher Philip Pettit. The capability approach, pioneered by economists Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen and further developed by legal scholar Martha Nussbaum, understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act.

Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle The Allegory of Good and Bad Government by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (painted 1338\u20131340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406\u20131475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but \"the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time\".Skinner, Quentin, The Foundations of Modern Political Thought, vol I: The Renaissance; vol II: The Age of Reformation, Cambridge University Press, p. 69"]}, {"page": "Republic", "response": ["While the classical writers had been the primary ideological source for the republics of Italy, in Northern Europe, the Protestant Reformation would be used as justification for establishing new republics.Finer, Samuel.

In Britain the history of political thought has been a particular focus since the late 1960s, and is especially associated with historians at Cambridge, such as  John Dunn and Quentin Skinner, who studied European political thought in historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of concepts such as the State and Freedom. Skinner is known for provocative, methodological essays that give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.Richter, Melvin. \u201cReconstructing the History of Political Languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe\u201d, History and Theory (1990): 38\u201370. online In the United States, intellectual history encompass different forms of intellectual production, not just the history of political ideas, and includes fields such as the history of historical thought, associated with Anthony Grafton (Princeton University) and J.G.A.

In such a case, to utter \"I do\" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to get married. The intended force of \"I do\" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage.
