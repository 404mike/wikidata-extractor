Amy Brooke (20 April 1852 \u2013 16 November 1939) was an English promoter of women's education. She was an early student at both Girton College and Newnham College and one of the first two students to sit the tripos examinations in Cambridge. She entered education where she helped to create a \"women's department\" at what would be Manchester University. She wrote about women's rights and the growth of \"white blouse\" employment.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Hall Kennedy", "response": ["He supported the access of women to a university education, and took a prominent part in the establishment of Newnham and Girton colleges. When Mary Paley and Amy Bulley were among the first women to take tripos examinations they did it in the Kennedys' drawing room. Paley described him as excitable, but he would sometimes doze whilst nominally invigilating. He was nicknamed \"the purple boy\". In politics, he had liberal sympathies. He died near Torquay and is buried in Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge."]}, {"page": "Mary Paley Marshall", "response": ["She was educated at home, excelling in languages: in 1871, after performing well in  entrance exams, she earned a scholarship to become one of the first five students at the recently founded Newnham College in Cambridge.Mary Paley Marshall, One of Five Original Newnham College Students, Newnham College, ArtUK, Retrieved 20 February 2017 She took the Moral Sciences Tripos in 1874, and was classed between a first and second-class, though as a woman she was debarred from graduation. Paley sat the exam with Amy Bulley. They were some of the first women to take tripos examinations and they sat the exams in Marion and Benjamin Hall Kennedy's drawing room. Paley described Professor Kennedy as excitable, but he would sometimes doze whilst invigilating. The only evidence she was given of her work was a confidential letter from her examiners. Women sitting the tripos examination was a milestone for Cambridge University and the importance can be gauged by the people involved. The people who delivered Paley and Bulley's papers were Alfred Marshall, Henry Sidgwick, John Venn and Sedley Taylor. She was to pass with honours but this did not entitle her to an official degree. Cambridge was to resist recognising its own women graduates; a restriction that was, later, to be supported by her future husband."]}, {"page": "Ella Sophia Armitage", "response": ["Armitage was born Ella Sophia Bulley in Liverpool, the second daughter of Samuel Marshall Bulley, a cotton merchant, and Mary Rachel Raffles.  In October 1871 she was one of the first students to enter Newnham College, Cambridge. Two of her sisters also attended Newnham, including Amy Bulley who sat the tripos.Linda Walker, \u2018Bulley , (Agnes) Amy (1852\u20131939)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2010 accessed 22 Feb 2017"]}, {"page": "Arthur Bulley", "response": ["He married Harriet Agnes Whishaw in 1890. They were both committed teetotallers and politically active. They had two children together, Agnes Lois Bulley (1901\u20131995) and Alfred Wishaw Bulley (born 1905). Bulley's sisters included Amy Bulley and Ella Sophia Armitage, who unusually had a university education."]}]}}
