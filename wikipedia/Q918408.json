Subsequently, John Tout replaced Hawken on keyboards, followed by a period of high turnover of musicians until the \"classic line-up\" of Annie Haslam, John Tout, Michael Dunford, Jon Camp, and Terry Sullivan was established, although none of them were in the original band. They were assisted with lyrics on many songs from Cornish poet Betty Thatcher-Newsinger. From 1972 to 1979 Renaissance released seven successful studio albums, toured extensively, and sold out three nights in a row at Carnegie Hall with Tony Cox conducting the New York Philharmonic.Snider, Charles (2007).

After Relf's death (May 1976), the surviving four formed a new band (along with two new musicians) and named it Illusion after Renaissance's second album.  Illusion released two albums for Island Records before splitting, while a third made up of unreleased demos appeared years later.
