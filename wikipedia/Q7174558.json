He then did a post-graduate teaching course at Crewe & Alsager College (1976\u201377), and lastly a post-graduate librarianship at Liverpool Polytechnic (1979\u201380). He has been an oral historian at the Sound Archive of Imperial War Museum in London since 1981.\nHart has written mainly on British participation in the First World War. His books include; The Somme, Jutland 1916, Bloody April on the air war in 1917, Passchendaele, Aces Falling (on the air war in 1918), 1918 A Very British Victory and Gallipoli.

Broadbent describes the campaign as \"a close-fought affair\" that was a defeat for the Allies, while Carlyon views the overall result as a stalemate. Peter Hart disagrees, arguing that the Ottoman forces \"held the Allies back from their real objectives with relative ease\", while Haythornthwaite calls it a \"disaster for the Allies\". The campaign did cause \"enormous damage to\u00a0... [Ottoman] national resources\", and at that stage of the war the Allies were in a better position to replace their losses than the Ottomans, but ultimately the Allied attempt at securing a passage through the Dardanelles proved unsuccessful. While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front, and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side."]}, {"page": "Barton-under-Needwood", "response": ["* Peter Hart (born in 1955) a British military historian who grew up in Barton"]}, {"page": "Peter Hart (historian)", "response": ["Peter Hart (11 November 1963 \u2013 22 July 2010) was a Canadian historian, specializing in modern Irish history.", "In the 1990s he developed cancer and underwent a liver transplant - events which permanently affected his health.

Regan wrote:\"Hart is neither a statist nor a southern nationalist, though the influence of both ideologies can be traced though his work. His research on localised and specialised topics subverts orthodoxy, but it is his willingness to embrace it when dealing with general explanations which surprises. His exploration of the plight of Protestants in the Free State illuminates the sectarian underbelly of the revolution that a nationalist historiography prefers to ignore. In escalating violence in Cork, Tipperary, or Dublin could Michael Collins, Harry Boland, or Ernie O'Malley be held accountable for raising sectarian tensions in Antrim, Down or Belfast? Was the cost of a southern state the institutionalisation of ethno-religious tensions in a compressed and reactionary northern state? Could revolutionary violence in 1922 and 1968 conceivably be part of one grotesque, protracted process? To accept this argument would, however, be to shatter nationalist icons important to a southern nationalist identity still rooted in its own glorious revolution.\"John Regan, Book Review: The IRA at War 1916\u20131923, Reviews in History, retrieved 29 August 2009.", "Some of Hart's published claims attracted criticism from other historians and writers,Diarmaid Fleming, \"'War of words' over battle\", BBC News, 26 November 2004. including two incidents in The IRA and its Enemies. One was the Kilmichael Ambush of 28 November 1920. Hart challenged the account of commander Tom Barry who stated the Auxiliaries engaged in a false surrender that caused two IRA fatalities, after which Barry refused further surrender calls and ordered a fight to the finish without prisoners. Hart posited this never happened and alleged that Barry ordered the killing of all prisoners.Tom Barry, Guerrilla Days in Ireland, 1949, pp. 40-46; Peter Hart, The IRA and its Enemies, 1998, pp. 34-35.", "\"Kilmichael veteran's son challenges Hart\" , southernstar.ie, 5 July 2008.

Ryan reported him too ill to have contributed to Hart's research. This assertion was supported in an affidavit published in 2008 by Ned Young's son, John.Niall Meehan, Brian Murphy (OSB), \"Troubled History - a Tenth Anniversary Critique of Peter Hart's The IRA and its Enemies\", academia.edu; accessed 11 March 2015.

The second last surviving Kilmichael veteran, Jack O'Sullivan, died in December 1986. However, Hart dated an additional interview with his second anonymous Kilmichael veteran on 19 November 1989, six days after Ned Young died. Hart claimed his interviewee was an unarmed ambush scout, although the last ambush scout, Dan O'Driscoll, reportedly died in 1967.
