The first club Captain was the Nationalist MP for Limerick Michael Joyce. In the 1930s it was served with notice to quit as the land on which the boathouse stood was required for the dock expansion. After a period of inactivity and great uncertainty, a new boathouse was constructed at O'Callaghan Strand in 1940. Since then the club has grown and developed, and is currently one of the largest clubs affiliated to Rowing Ireland. In 2013 the club purchased a site in O'Briensbridge, Co Clare adjacent to the Limerick Regatta field. This non-tidal facility can be used when weather conditions prohibit training on the lower Shannon. The club history was documented in \"Band of Gold\" which was published in November 2016."]}, {"page": "List of mayors of Limerick", "response": ["| Michael Joyce"]}]}}
