He studied at the University of Edinburgh, where he gained a Ph.D. in Chemistry (1957). He was most famous for his controversial 1985 book Seven Clues to the Origin of Life.\nThe book popularized a hypothesis he began to develop in the mid-1960s\u2014that self-replication of clay crystals in solution might provide a simple intermediate step between biologically inert matter and organic life. He inspired other ideas about chemical evolution, including the Miller\u2013Urey experiment and the RNA World, all of which are hypotheses that have played important roles in attempts to understand the origin of life.\nCairns-Smith also published on the evolution of consciousness, in Evolving the Mind (1996), favoring a role for quantum mechanics in human thought. He died on 26 August 2016.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ancient astronauts", "response": ["* 1975: Graham Cairns-Smith (a biochemist who suggested that the ancestors of humans might have had alien biochemistries and presented evidence to support this possibility in a biological research journal)"]}, {"page": "Bootstrapping (biology)", "response": ["Some biologists, including Graham Cairns-Smith, believe that the origin of life itself may have been a bootstrap process as one or more systems of biological information storage formed the foundation for successor systems that ultimately supplanted them culminating in the emergence of our current DNA-based system."]}, {"page": "A.G.
