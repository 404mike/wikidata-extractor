Brodie.  He was born in London in 1815. While residing with his father at Lincoln's Inn Fields, he gained some knowledge of natural history and an interest in fossils from visits to the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, at a time when William Clift was curator. Through the influence of Clift he was elected a fellow of the Geological Society early in 1834.Proceeding to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Brodie came under the influence of Adam Sedgwick, and devoted his time to geology. Entering the church in 1838, he was curate at Wylye in Wiltshire, and for a short time at Steeple Claydon in Buckinghamshire, becoming later rector of Down Hatherley in Gloucestershire, and finally (1855) vicar of Rowington in Warwickshire, and rural dean. Records of geological observations in all these districts were published by him.At Cambridge Brodie obtained fossil shells from the Pleistocene deposit at Barnwell, Northamptonshire; in the Vale of Wardour he discovered in Purbeck Beds the isopod named by Henri Milne-Edwards Archaeoniscus Brodiei; in Buckinghamshire he described the outliers of Purbeck and Portland Beds; and in the Vale of Gloucester the lias and oolites claimed his attention. Fossil insects, however, formed the subject of his special studies (History of the Fossil Insects of the Secondary Rocks of England, 1845), and many of his published papers relate to them. At present the best exposure of his Purbeck beds for collecting fossil insects is at Teffont Evias Quarry / Lane Cutting.Brodie was an active member of the Cotteswold Naturalist's Club and of the Warwickshire Natural History and Archaeological Society, and in 1854 he was chief founder of the Warwickshire Naturalists' and Archaeologists' Field Club. In 1887 the Murchison Medal was awarded to him by the Geological Society of London. He died at Rowington, Warwickshire on 1 November 1897.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1815 in science", "response": ["* Peter Bellinger Brodie, English geologist and clergyman (died 1897)"]}, {"page": "1897 in science", "response": ["* November 1 \u2013 Peter Bellinger Brodie (born 1815), English geologist and clergyman."]}, {"page": "Brodie", "response": ["* Peter Bellinger Brodie (1815\u20131897), British geologist and churchman"]}, {"page": "Teffont Evias Quarry and Lane Cutting", "response": ["This is a key site in the history of British palaeoentomology;An introduction to the fossil arthropods of Great Britain.

(Pterygotus) and P. (Acutiramus), as well as two subgenera of Erettopterus; E. (Erettopterus) and E. (Truncatiramus). Additionally, he described four new English species, E. marstoni, E. spatulatus, E. megalodon and E. brodiei. E. marstoni (honoring Alfred Marston, responsible for several collections of fishes and eurypterids) is based on incomplete specimens, which together represent an almost complete chelicera. The holotype (BMNH 43790, in the British Museum of Natural History) consists of a free ramus, and the paratype (BMNH 43805, in the same museum as the holotype) includes most of the fixed ramus, that is very slender and tapering to the curved distal end. A large tooth is present in the midsection of the ramus. The end of the ramus is broken, but probably ended in a double tooth. This feature is also present in E. brodiei, only known from one specimen (FMNH 89411, located in the Field Museum of Natural History) which consists of an uncrushed chela. Its specific name honors Peter Bellinger Brodie, whose collections of eurypterids have helped the scientific community. E. spatulatus is remarkable by its shovel-or fan-shaped telson, which is wider than long and gives it the specific name. These telsons are rare, and have only been seen in E. grandis. In the same year, he described an American species, E. serratus (Latin for \"serrated\"), from the Lower Devonian age in Ohio. This species is based on a complete and well-preserved free ramus (FMNH 5104, in the Field Museum of Natural History). This species differs from the others by its thick chela and the aforementioned short and robust teeth.Kjellesvig-Waering, Erik N.
