Although he was an accomplished geometer, he is best remembered today for two important contributions to general relativity.\nTogether with H. P. Robertson, they devised the well-known Robertson-Walker metric for the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker cosmological models, which are exact solutions of the Einstein field equation. Together with Enrico Fermi, he introduced the notion of Fermi\u2013Walker differentiation.", "link_mentions": {}}}
