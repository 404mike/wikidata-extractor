Although he was an accomplished geometer, he is best remembered today for two important contributions to general relativity.\nTogether with H. P. Robertson, they devised the well-known Robertson-Walker metric for the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker cosmological models, which are exact solutions of the Einstein field equation. Together with Enrico Fermi, he introduced the notion of Fermi\u2013Walker differentiation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric", "response": ["The Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW; ) metric is an exact solution of Einstein's field equations of general relativity; it describes a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding (or otherwise, contracting) universe that is path-connected, but not necessarily simply connected.For an early reference, see Robertson (1935); Robertson assumes multiple connectedness in the positive curvature case and says that \"we are still free to restore\" simple connectedness. The general form of the metric follows from the geometric properties of homogeneity and isotropy; Einstein's field equations are only needed to derive the scale factor of the universe as a function of time. Depending on geographical or historical preferences, the set of the four scientists \u2013 Alexander Friedmann, Georges Lema\u00eetre, Howard P. Robertson and Arthur Geoffrey Walker \u2013 are customarily grouped as Friedmann or Friedmann\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FRW) or Robertson\u2013Walker (RW) or Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre (FL). This model is sometimes called the Standard Model of modern cosmology, although such a description is also associated with the further developed Lambda-CDM model. The FLRW model was developed independently by the named authors in the 1920s and 1930s.", "Howard P. Robertson from the US and Arthur Geoffrey Walker from the UK explored the problem further during the 1930s. In 1935 Robertson and Walker rigorously proved that the FLRW metric is the only one on a spacetime that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic (as noted above, this is a geometric result and is not tied specifically to the equations of general relativity, which were always assumed by Friedmann and Lema\u00eetre)."]}, {"page": "Scientific phenomena named after people", "response": ["* Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric (a.k.a.
