She received instruction from artists Rowland Suddaby, Raymond Coxon, and Edna Ginesi, becoming associated with the London Group and the Euston Road School.  She painted primarily in watercolor. Her work included still-life, portraits, townscapes and landscapes. Although her first work was done in a \"slightly plain palette,\" her later work in the 1930s brightened, sometimes falling within the realm of fauvism. \"Under the influence of the Surrealists, Hazel's paintings after the 1930's became freer, though her work was far more whimsical and humorous than many artists more closely associated with the movement\" ", "She continued to paint and ran a small gallery of her own in the late 1950s and early 1960s in West Cornwall, Connecticut.  A newspaper advertisement for the gallery read:  Hazel McKinley Gallery, Gifts, Antiques, Modern Ceramics, Paintings. Covered Bridge Shopping Center, West Cornwall, Conn. Open Daily Except Sunday.  One show at her gallery featured the works of British and Irish painters including Rowland Suddaby, Frank Beteson, Tom Nisbett, and Patrick Swift. Hazel had two of her own works also shown in the same exhibit, a watercolor painted at Positano, Italy and one painted at the Tuileries, Paris. Another featured work was a surrealistic water color portrait of Hazel by London artist Mervyn Peake."]}]}}
