Many of his novels, set in exotic countries, are about his experiences as leading foreign correspondent for the Daily Mail. He was the son of John Barber and his Danish wife, Musse, and had two brothers: Kenneth, a banker, and Anthony Barber, Baron Barber.Most notably he reported from Morocco, where he was stabbed five times. In October 1956, Barber survived a gunshot wound to the head by a Soviet sentry in Hungary during the Hungarian revolution. A car crash ended his career as journalist. He then began writing novels: he became a best-selling novelist in his seventies with his first novel, Tanamera.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Farouk of Egypt", "response": ["* A \"Woman of Cairo\", written by Noel Barber, offers an inside look of Farouk's palace intrigues and scandals."]}, {"page": "Maxime Weygand", "response": ["* Noel Barber, The Week France Fell, MacMillan London Limited, London, 1976."]}, {"page": "Tanamera \u2013 Lion of Singapore", "response": ["The series is based on the novel, Tanamera, by Noel Barber.

British author Noel Barber heard of Neale's life on the island from a report by the United States Navy and paid him a visit. Fourteen months later, his next visit was from an old friend from Rarotonga, investigating rumours that Neale had died. Many months later another yacht visited, with a couple and their daughter. A squall hit the lagoon that night, the yacht's anchoring cable parted, and it foundered on a reef.
