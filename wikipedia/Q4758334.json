The background is of orthodox Anglicans wishing to discredit the sectarian Protestants of the period; but also to validate the existence of spirits to atheists. Casaubon was in touch with Nicholas Bernard about the Dee manuscript.Ian Bostridge, Witchcraft and its Transformations, c.1650-c.1750 (1997), pp. 55\u20137. Following the Restoration, Casaubon wrote supporting the traditional theories of witchcraft.Bostridge, p. 53. He was in fact operating on several fronts: as well as attacking those who would deny the supernatural entirely, and limiting the role of reason in faith, he defended humanist learning against the claims for the new natural philosophy, emanating from figures in the Royal Society who saw it as completely replacing the old learning.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article on Casaubon, pp. 162\u20133."]}, {"page": "Kenelm Digby", "response": ["In 1644 he published together two major philosophical treatises, The Nature of Bodies and On the Immortality of Reasonable Souls.

Many professional philosophers claim that infinite divisibility involves either a collection of an infinite number of items (since there are infinite divisions, there must be an infinite collection of objects), or (more rarely), point-sized items, or both.
