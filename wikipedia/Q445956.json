Of the two parents, Julia's \"nervous energy dominated the family\". While Virginia identified most closely with her father, Vanessa stated her mother was her favourite parent. Angelica Garnett recalls how Virginia asked Vanessa which parent she preferred, although Vanessa considered it a question that \"one ought not to ask\", she was unequivocal in answering \"Mother\" yet the centrality of her mother to Virginia's world is expressed in this description of her \"Certainly there she was, in the very centre of that great Cathedral space which was childhood; there she was from the very first\". Virginia observed that her half-sister, Stella, the oldest daughter, led a life of total subservience to her mother, incorporating her ideals of love and service.
