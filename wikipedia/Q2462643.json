At the age of three his mother died and his father moved to Cobham in Kent. He studied at Tonbridge School and then went to Haileybury where his brother Stuart also studied. At Cobham, he had taken to the idea of collecting insects and he continued this at Haileybury where the school encouraged him to publish a \"List of the Mammals and Coleoptera of Haileybury\". The two brothers left Haileybury and Henry went to a private tutor at Medmenham near Henley who encouraged him in Zoology and then went to Exeter College, Oxford where he studied under Edwin Ray Lankester and George Rolleston while also taking an interest in botany and geology under the influence of Marmaduke Lawson and Joseph Prestwich. He graduated in 1878 and received a Burdett-Coutts scholarship that let him conduct research on fossils from quarries near Oxford. He then joined the British Museum in the botany department to replace Henry Trimen who had moved to Ceylon. He specialised in the monocotyledons and also began to travel around Europe. In 1887 he joined the Royal Society expedition with George Ramage to the island of Fernando de Noronha off Brazil, and published on the collections on returning. In 1888 he applied and was selected for the post of director of Gardens and Forests in the Straits Settlements. He was to meet Odoardo Beccari at Florence for information and to meet Trimen at Peradeniya to learn about rubber cultivation along the route."]}, {"page": "Roland Trimen", "response": ["Trimen was born in London in 1840, the son of Richard and Mary Ann Esther Trimen and the older brother of the botanist Henry Trimen (1843-1896) who went to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).

Trimen thought about choosing a name commemorating the collector of the species, one Captain Gill, R.E., but decided against it, as there already was a genus Gilia (Polemoniaceae), and he wished to avoid, in his words, \"the formation of another of precisely similar sound.\" As the species was collected from a mountain named Ra-Ma-La, it is likely that the specific epithet \"ramalana\" was chosen as a toponym (the suffix \"-ana\" meaning \"belonging to\", hence \"from Ra-Ma-La\")."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (T\u2013V)", "response": ["* Trimen \u2013 Henry Trimen (1843\u20131896)"]}, {"page": "Kew Rule", "response": ["The first discussion in print of what was to become known as the Kew Rule appears to have occurred in 1877 between Henry Trimen and Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle. Trimen did not think it was reasonable for older names discovered in the literature to destabilize the nomenclature that had been well accepted:Probably all botanists are agreed that it is very desirable to retain when possible old specific names, but some of the best authors do not certainly consider themselves bound by any generally accepted rule in this matter. Still less will they be inclined to allow that a writer is at liberty, as M. de Candolle thinks, to reject the specific appellations made by an author whose genera are accepted, in favour of older ones in other genera. It will appear to such that to do this is to needlessly create in each case another synonym."]}, {"page": "Wrightia flavorosea", "response": ["Wrightia flavorosea, was a flowering plant in the genus Wrightia.
