This is surely an error, because contradicted by more recent and reliable sources both in English and Japanese, for example Shirai and Hall. Takauji believed the military class had the right to rule and considered himself not a usurper but, since the Ashikaga descended from a branch of the Minamoto clan, rather a restorer of Minamoto power. When the H\u014dj\u014d garrison at Rokuhara was destroyed in 1333, he immediately stepped in and installed there his office (bugy\u014dsho). It kept order in the city and in general took over the original's function. Extending its authority to controlling travel along highways, issuing passports and exercising rights previously belonging to the shogunate's deputies (the Rokuhara Tandai), Takauji showed he believed that samurai political power must continue. His setting himself apart as a representative of the military made him an aggregation point for the warriors' discontent. Samurai saw him as the man who could bring back the shogunate's heyday, and therefore his strength was superior to that of any other samurai, Nitta Yoshisada included. His only obstacle to the shogunate was Prince Morinaga."]}, {"page": "Battle of Shizugatake", "response": ["The Battle of Shizugatake allowed Hideyoshi to consolidate his position as Oda Nobunaga's successor, and was one of the last challenges to his rule along with the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584.

Initially, Borton sought guidance from Sir George Sansom, a British scholar who was then serving in the British Consulate. In 1931, Borton returned to America to further his education. He completed a master's degree in history at Columbia University and studied briefly at Harvard University. He then traveled across the Atlantic to pursue further study under the supervision of Professors J. J. L. Duyvendak and Johannes Rahder at Leiden University in the Netherlands. He was awarded his PhD by Leiden after several years of work at Tokyo Imperial University. He returned to the United States to take a position on the faculty at Columbia, lecturing on modern Japanese history and language. He also played a key role in structuring the first undergraduate program in Japanese studies in the newly expanded Department of Chinese and Japanese. His research publications prior to the Second World War included Peasant Uprisings in Japan of the Tokugawa Period and Japan Since 1931: Its Political and Social Development.", "In 1948 Borton returned to academic life at Columbia, where he was a prominent organizer of the East Asian Institute as the University's centre of modern and contemporary East Asian studies. He replaced the inaugural director, Sir George Sansom, and later helped to establish the Association for Asian Studies, serving as its first treasurer and later as its president. Among his works were Japan Under Allied Occupation, 1945\u20131947 and Japan's Modern Century, which went on to become one of the most widely used history texts of his period."]}, {"page": "Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)", "response": ["Despite great interest in the war in East Asia,Swope. 2005. p.\u00a012. the Japanese invasions of Korea are not widely known in the West.Swope. 2005. p.\u00a014.

The British diplomat George Sansom, who later became a renowned historian of Japan, was a major contributor and editor of this edition.  Aside from the ever-evolving nature of the Japanese and English languages, competition from two other major dictionaries released in the 1920s \u2013 Takehara's Japanese\u2013English Dictionary and Sait\u014d's Japanese\u2013English Dictionary, both of which were larger than the first edition of Kenky\u016bsha's \u2013 was probably a major driving force behind these revisions (although new editions of these dictionaries were never released, allowing Kenky\u016bsha's to assert and maintain its dominance among Japanese\u2013English dictionaries).

In 1331, as events began to come to a boil, Takatoki argued with his advisor Nagasaki over how to react to the Burei-k\u014d plot, in which members of the Hino clan, loyal to Go-Daigo, conspired against the shogunate. This was but one of many events leading up to the outbreak of war, and the conflicts within the shogunal administration, between Takatoki and others, meant slow reactions and inadequate handling of such situations. Ashikaga Takauji would soon be placed in command of the shogunate's armies, to be mobilized against Go-Daigo's supporters; strongly supported by Takatoki, this support and trust was misplaced, for Takauji would soon use these same armies against Kamakura, tearing down the Minamoto/H\u014dj\u014d government and establishing his own Ashikaga shogunate."]}, {"page": "C.
