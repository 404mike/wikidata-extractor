After a few matches in 1921 and 1922, he became a regular member of the Kent team in 1923 and remained a regular choice until the middle of the 1931 season, when he lost form and was dropped, not regaining his place in the side.Wright and George Collins provided the seam bowling alternative to the spin of Tich Freeman and Frank Woolley which dominated Kent's bowling across the 1920s. Both his best batting and bowling performances came in the 1924 season, relatively early in his first-class career. Against Essex in June 1924 in the second innings he scored 81, putting on 157 in about 75 minutes for the eighth wicket with the debutant Alan Hilder, which stood as the Kent record for that wicket until 2007. In August of the same year, he took five Somerset wickets for 33 runs in the first innings and followed that with seven for 31 in the second innings, providing both his best innings and match figures. In 1925, in the match against Warwickshire, Wright was the first victim in a sequence of four wickets in five balls by the Warwickshire player Robert Cooke; in Warwickshire's second innings, Wright returned the favour with a hat-trick in which Cooke was one of his victims.Wright's best seasons as a bowler were 1926 and 1927 and in both of these years he took more than 100 wickets at an average below 21 runs per wicket. His aggregates fell away from 1928 as Freeman came to dominate Kent's bowling almost single-handedly, and he was also more expensive from 1928 onwards. He remained a useful lower-order batsman, and passed 50 nine times in all, scoring more than 500 runs in both 1924 and 1929.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Wright", "response": ["* Charlie Wright (Kent cricketer) (1895\u20131959), English cricketer", "* Charlie Wright (born 1938), Scottish football manager and player"]}, {"page": "Albert Wright", "response": ["*Charlie Wright (Kent cricketer) (1895\u20131959), English cricketer whose first forename was Albert"]}, {"page": "Robert Cooke (Warwickshire cricketer)", "response": ["Cooke was a tail-end right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. In his second first-class match, the game against Kent at The Nevill Ground, Tunbridge Wells in July 1925, he finished off the Kent first innings with a hat-trick of three wickets in three balls, in fact taking four wickets in five balls; later in the same match, he was himself part of a hat-trick taken by the Kent bowler Charlie Wright which finished off the Warwickshire second innings. Cooke's figures of five wickets for 22 runs in Kent's first innings were by some distance the best of his career, and in no other innings in a brief first-class career did he take more than two wickets."]}, {"page": "Alan Hilder", "response": ["He made his first-class cricket debut for Kent in June 1924 against Essex at Gravesend. He scored a century in Kent's second innings of the match and set a Kent record for the 8th wicket in first-class cricket which stood until 2007, scoring 157 runs in partnership with Charlie Wright. This was Hilder's only century of his career and he was considered to have \"never afterwards approached that form\". He played 14 times for Kent, his final match coming in 1929."]}, {"page": "Charlie Wright (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECTCharlie Wright (Kent cricketer)"]}]}}
