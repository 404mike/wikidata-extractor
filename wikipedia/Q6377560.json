The film was shot entirely on location within England on an 11-week schedule during the 2004 summer. Co-producer Paul Webster noted that \"it is quite unusual for a movie this size to be shot entirely on location. Part of Joe [Wright]'s idea was to try to create a reality which allows the actors to relax and feel at one with their environment.\" Working under production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer, the crew filmed on seven estates in six different counties. Because \"nothing exists in the United Kingdom that is untouched by the twenty-first century\", many of the sites required substantial work to make them suitable for filming. Visual effects company Double Negative digitally restored several locations to make them contemporaneous; they eradicated weeds, enhanced gold plating on window frames, and removed anachronisms such as gravel driveways and electricity pylons. Double Negative also developed the typeface used for the film's title sequence.", "| Sarah Greenwood, Katie Spencer"]}, {"page": "Joe Wright", "response": ["!

Seamus McGarvey, the cinematographer, worked closely with Wright on the aesthetics of the visualisation, using a range of techniques and camera movements to achieve the final result."]}, {"page": "80th Academy Awards", "response": ["** Atonement\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Sarah Greenwood; Set Decoration: Katie Spencer"]}, {"page": "61st British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["Atonement \u2013 Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Atonement || style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer", "| Anna Karenina || Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer", "| Beauty and the Beast || Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer", "| Darkest Hour || Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer", "| Rebecca || Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer"]}, {"page": "Horsforth School", "response": ["*Katie Spencer, Academy Award nominated film production designer"]}, {"page": "Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)", "response": ["| Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer"]}]}}
