He was also noted for his contributions to the study of history. Within anthropology, some of his most important contributions were to the study of gender, as in his 1975 work in which he described women as \"muted\" in social discourse.A graduate of the LSE, Ardener took up an Oxford lectureship in social anthropology at the invitation of E. E. Evans-Pritchard. His ethnographic research concentrated on Africa, particularly on Cameroon. His history of the Bakweri of Cameroon in the nineteenth century is regarded as definitive. In his works about Cameroon, he also wrote about a form of witchcraft in Cameroon known as Nyongo.One of his best-known contributions to anthropology came in the 1975 article \"\"The Problem\" revisited\", in Perceiving Women, a volume edited by his wife and fellow anthropologist Shirley Ardener. In this essay he advanced the theory that women have been a muted group, comparatively unheard in social discourse, whose relative silence might also be seen as a function of the dominant group's deafness to them. He identified a problematic tendency in anthropological methodology to talk only to men and about women, thereby ignoring at least half the sample of people they were supposed to be observing. Ardener diagnosed the problem as a result of the fact that ethnographic methods were both devised and verified by male anthropologists, who did not realise what they were overlooking.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Rupert Firth", "response": ["His approach can be considered as resuming that of Malinowski's anthropological semantics, and as a precursor of the approach of semiotic anthropology.Edwin Ardener (editor) (1971) Social anthropology and language, Milton B.

A Bakweri honorific, mokpel'anembongo, translates as \"free-born and descended from Mbongo\".Austen and Derrick 14. Edwin Ardener proposes that the names of many of Cameroon's coastal ethnic groups historically derived from the name Mbongo. For example, in 1668, a Dutch writer named O. Dapper, drawing from the records of Samuel Blommaert, described a people called the Kalbongos at the Rio del Rey: \"The people who live higher up the river [from a coastal trading settlement], by them called Kalbongos, are bold men, but villainous rogues.\"Dapper, Dr. O. (1668). Naukeurige Beschrijvinge der Afrikanische Gewesten. Amesterdam. Quoted in Ardener 14. Dapper also recorded names such as Kalbanges, which may also derive from some form of Mbongo's name.Ardener 15\u201316.

The main idea of MGT is that \"Language serves its creators better than those in other groups who have to learn to use the language as best they can.\"", "in 1968, Edwin Ardener pointed out a phenomenon where anthropologists had difficulties reproducing models of the society from women's perspectives, if they (the models) do not conform to those generated by men. ", "thumbnail|Ardener's Dominant Group vs Muted Group|336x336pxMuted Group Theory was firstly developed in the field of cultural anthropology by the British anthropologist, Edwin Ardener. The first formulation of MGT emerges from one of Edwin Ardener's short essays, entitled \"Belief and the Problem of Women,\" in which Ardener explored the \"problem\" of women. In social anthropology, the problem of women is divided in two parts: technical and analytical. The technical problem is that although half of the population and society is technically made up of women, ethnographers have often ignored this half of the population. Ardener writes that \"those trained in ethnography evidently have a bias towards the kinds of model that men are ready to provide (or to concur in) rather than towards any that women might provide.\"Ardener, Edwin, & Chapman, Malcolm. (2007). The voice of prophecy and other essays. New York: Berghahn Books.  He also suggests that the reason behind this is that men tend to give a \"bounded model of society\" akin to the ones that ethnographers are attracted to.  Therefore, men are those who produce and control symbolic production in a society. This leads to the analytical part of the problem which attempts to answer the question: \"[\u2026] if the models of society made by most ethnographers tend to be models derived from the male portion of that society, how does the symbolic weight of the other mass of persons express itself?\"", "Edwin Ardener saw that MGT had pragmatic as well as analytical potentials.  Edwin Ardener always maintained that MGT was not only, or even primarily, about women - although women comprised a conspicuous case in point. In fact, he also drew on his personal experience as a sensitive boy among hearty boys in an all-boys London secondary school. As a result of his early encounters with other boys, he identified with other groups in society for whom self-expression was constrained."]}, {"page": "Semiotic anthropology", "response": ["*Edwin Ardener (editor) (1971) Social anthropology and language, "]}, {"page": "Purity and Danger", "response": ["*Edwin Ardener in Man, New Series, 2:1 (1967), p.\u00a0139."]}, {"page": "Co-cultural communication theory", "response": ["Co-cultural communication theory was built upon the frameworks of muted group theory and standpoint theory.

The researchers would then use this data to represent the culture as a whole, leaving out the perspectives of women, children and other groups made voiceless by the cultural hierarchy (S. Ardener, 1975).Ardener, Shirley, 1975.
