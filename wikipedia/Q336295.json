It carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed that the cause was not cancer.Ridley, p. 365 The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar.The Duke of Windsor, p. 20 Two weeks later, it was announced that he was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which the King had arranged before the operation)Bentley-Cranch, p. 127 and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream.
