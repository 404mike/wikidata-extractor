He had also played for Hampshire since 1991 in the Second XI Championship.\nWhile he was used sporadically in this championship from 1991 (though he neither performed with the bat or ball during his debut), he played his debut First-class match in 1995, a draw against Northamptonshire which saw centuries from captain Robin Smith and Mark Nicholas. He participated in the County Championship for six years, though did not play regularly during Hampshire's Division Two season of 2001, and stopped playing First-class cricket a year later. During his last cricket match, against Hampshire Second XI, he was dismissed for a duck.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "NBC Denis Compton Award", "response": ["*Hampshire \u2013 Jason Laney"]}, {"page": "Giles White", "response": ["Having played extensively through the beginning of the 2002 season, White did not play a single game from August onwards, choosing to hang up his gloves, and leaving the team along with Jason Laney, James Schofield and Irfan Shah."]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club List A cricket records", "response": ["| 1st || 269 || John Stephenson & Jason Laney || Norfolk || County Ground, Southampton || 1996"]}, {"page": "Laney (surname)", "response": ["*Jason Laney (born 1973), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Jason Laney, cricketer, was born in Winchester"]}, {"page": "South Wilts Cricket Club", "response": ["* Jason Laney"]}]}}
