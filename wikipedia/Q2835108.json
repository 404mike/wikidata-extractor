It was also in this game that the Australians first wore the green jersey with a double gold 'V', which they have been wearing ever since. The English side boasted one of the great rugby league back lines consisting of captain Jim Sullivan (fullback), Alf Ellaby and Stan Smith (wings), and Artie Atkinson and Stan Brogden in the centres. The gates of the SCG had to be closed to prevent another 15,000 people from entering. Australia lost the game 8\u20136. The second game was the famous \"Battle of Brisbane\" Test, which Australia won. In the third Test back at the SCG Australia lead 11\u20133 until late in the game. Incredibly, England scored three quick tries to snatch the game (18\u201313) and the series.
