The founder, Donald Trounson, served as the project\u2019s chief executive officer until 1981, when he was succeeded by Ronald Strahan.  It was established in association with the National Library of Australia under the direction of a trust chaired by Sir Percy Spender and was the first systematic attempt to compile a comprehensive photographic  record of the birds of any country.  In 1977 it was expanded to include mammals and, in 1984, reptiles and frogs, with the aim of progressively including other animal groups to become the most comprehensive possible archive of photographs of Australian wildlife and to provide an expanding service to the public, to photographers and to biological science.  In November 1980 the Index was incorporated as a part of the Australian Museum and the trust dissolved.Australian Museum: Selected Archival Holdings.Serventy (1982), p.xiii.", "The publication principally associated with the Index is a series of ten volumes on Australian birds published from 1982 to 1996.  It was conceived by Donald Trounson as a photographic equivalent of John Gould\u2019s Birds of Australia. Ronald Strahan, who was editor-in-chief of Volumes 3-10 says in his editorial foreword to the third volume:", "\u201dDonald Trounson was highly skilled in raising funds from government and corporate sources.  He also obtained support from individual donors by introducing an arrangement whereby illustrations could be sponsored in return for tax-exempt donations.  The project remains indebted to these sponsors, many of whom expressed their faith more than a decade ago and have had the patience to see it gradually come to fruition.  With the conclusion of this enterprise, it can be said with some confidence that nothing of its size and scope, based on photographs, is likely to be produced for a long while.\u201d"]}, {"page": "Trounson", "response": ["* Donald Trounson (1905-2009), British diplomat and Australian bird photographer"]}, {"page": "2009 in birding and ornithology", "response": ["*Donald Trounson"]}]}}
