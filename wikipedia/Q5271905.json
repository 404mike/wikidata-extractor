In 1984, he started at art college in Bristol.  In 1986 he joined \"Changing Places\", a community and environmental arts project, as a stone carver \u2013 leaving in 1988. In 1991 he studied conceptual fine art at Chelsea School of Art, London.\nStarting a decorating firm, Byron-O'Connor worked evenings sculpting with wax at home. He was commissioned to create a statue of Peter Pan to stand outside Great Ormond Street Hospital which was given the rights to the character by creator J. M. Barrie.  Following the unveiling of this work and an exhibition of small bronzes in 2000, he built a studio for private commissions. In 2005 he added a scale statue of Tinker Bell to the one of Peter Pan, unveiled by The Countess of Wessex.Byron-O'Connor's research into World War I led to him designing sets for BBC2's The Trench; BBC1's The Somme - From Defeat to Victory; and the Discovery Channel's Mud, Blood, and Tarmac. Whilst working on the set for BBC One's The Crafty Tricks of War he was asked to co present the series with Dick Strawbridge.  He subsequently made Geronimo with Fearne Cotton for BBC1.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tinker Bell", "response": ["A bronze sculpture of Tinker Bell by London artist Diarmuid Byron O'Connor was commissioned by Great Ormond Street Hospital, to whom Barrie bequeathed the copyright to the character, to be added to his original four-foot statue of Peter Pan, wresting a thimble from Peter's finger.
