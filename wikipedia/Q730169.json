He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue.

George Lucas decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where filming on Star Wars began.Star Wars Insider magazine issue No 98 January 2008 It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow."]}, {"page": "2000 in film", "response": ["| Battlefield Earth || Warner Bros.

A small blur could be seen under the speeder, which George Lucas called \"The Force Spot\" (stated in Special Edition Tape).
