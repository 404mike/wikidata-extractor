At that time forgery of Bank of England notes was common, and Tilloch in 1790 laid before the British ministry a mode of printing which would render forgery impossible. Receiving no encouragement, he brought his process before the notice of the Commission d'Assignats of the Legislative Assembly, at Paris, but then came the outbreak of war. In 1797 he submitted to the Bank of England a specimen of a note engraved after his plan, accompanied by a certificate signed by Francesco Bartolozzi, Wilson Lowry, William Sharp and other engravers, to the effect that they did not believe it could be copied by any of the known arts of engraving. He could not, however, persuade the authorities to accept it, though in 1810 they adopted the process of Augustus Applegath, which Tilloch claimed in 1820, in a petition to parliament, to be virtually his own."]}, {"page": "John Weale", "response": ["|WorldCat editionsLater editions with James Dwight Dana, as Rudimentary Treatise on Mineralogy.

In England Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia (1802\u201319) contains an enormous amount in information about the industrial and scientific revolutions of the time. A feature of these publications is the high-quality illustrations made by engravers like Wilson Lowry of art work supplied by specialist draftsmen like John Farey, Jr. Encyclopedias were published in Scotland, as a result of the Scottish Enlightenment, for education there was of a higher standard than in the rest of the United Kingdom. The National Revival of Bulgaria, influenced by the Enlightenment, resulted in Petar Beron's Primer with Various Instructions (also known as the Fish Primer) in 1824. It was a small encyclopedia for children, containing fables, proverbs, ancient history, basic arithmetics, zoology and linguistics.

This was followed in 1854 by The Mechanical Inventions of James Watt (3 vols.). The third volume, illustrated with engravings of machinery by Wilson Lowry, dealt with patent specifications; the second with extracts from correspondence.

Lowry and her father engraved the illustrations for the book from original sketches. Presented in the popular format of a conversation between two (female) students and their instructor, the book was generally well-received and went through three editions in Britain and an American edition. Lowry appears to have been mostly concerned with conveying her information clearly to those with a bare knowledge of mineralogy and her prose has been criticized for its stilted dialogue and lack of character development. It was notable, however, for avoiding any religious references common at that time.Larsen, pp. 107, 112\u201313, 116\u201317"]}, {"page": "Sandleford Priory (country house)", "response": ["Elizabeth Montagu by Wilson Lowry (1762-1824) engraving published April 1787.jpg|Elizabeth Montagu by Wilson Lowry (1762\u20131824) engraving published London, April 1787."]}]}}
