A contemporary of John William Waterhouse, his work is similar in many ways. His one famous piece was Hypatia, shown in 1885 and likely inspired by the Charles Kingsley serialized novel Hypatia, or New Foes with an Old Face.  This painting is currently in the Laing Art Gallery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hypatia", "response": ["Kingsley's novel was tremendously popular; it was translated into several European languages and remained continuously in print for the rest of the century. It promoted the romantic vision of Hypatia as \"the last of the Hellenes\" and was quickly adapted into a broad variety of stage productions, the first of which was a play written by Elizabeth Bowers, performed in Philadelphia in 1859, starring the writer herself in the titular role. On 2 January 1893, a much higher-profile stage play adaptation Hypatia, written by G. Stuart Ogilvie and produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree, opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London. The title role was initially played by Julia Neilson, and it featured an elaborate musical score written by the composer Hubert Parry. The novel also spawned works of visual art, including an 1867 image portraying Hypatia as a young woman by the early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron and an 1885 painting by Charles William Mitchell showing a nude Hypatia standing before an altar in a church."]}, {"page": "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood", "response": ["* Charles William Mitchell (painter)"]}, {"page": "1885 in art", "response": ["* Charles William Mitchell \u2013 Hypatia"]}, {"page": "Charles Mitchell", "response": ["* Charles William Mitchell (1854\u20131903), English pre-Raphaelite painter"]}, {"page": "Hypatia (novel)", "response": ["The novel notably inspired the painting Hypatia by Charles William Mitchell (1885, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle) which depicts Hypatia, naked, cowering against an altar, facing her (unseen) murderers.Michael A.
