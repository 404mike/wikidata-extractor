The group formed in 1982 under the title Fall of Because but did not release any complete music until 1988 when Justin Broadrick (guitar, vocals and programming) and G. C. Green (bass) renamed the band and decided to use a drum machine for percussion. Melding heavy metal with industrial music and later with electronic music and dub, Godflesh's innovative sound is widely regarded as a foundational influence on other industrial metal and post-metal acts and as significant to both experimental and extreme metal in general.", "The band that would eventually become Godflesh, Fall of Because, formed in 1982 when G. C. Green and Paul Neville, two young musicians living in cheap council estate housing in east Birmingham, started experimenting musically alongside a drum machine. Fall of Because, so named for a Killing Joke song and a chapter from an Aleister Crowley book, found a live drummer when Justin Broadrick, who lived in the same council housing as Green and Neville, joined the group in 1984 after organising a concert at The Mermaid in Birmingham. At that show, Fall of Because, Final (Broadrick's first musical act) and an early incarnation of Napalm Death performed before a crowd of twenty-five people. In the months following that concert, Broadrick joined Napalm Death as a guitarist and Fall of Because as a drummer and altered the latter's sound by introducing albums from Swans, Sonic Youth and Discharge to Green and Neville. Only fifteen at the time, Broadrick said he \"usurped\" their band.", "* G. C.

Final was revived in 1993 as an experimental ambient solo project meant to \"explore beat-less spaces\" and focus on textures, now expanding its influences to the likes of Brian Eno and Maurizio Bianchi. This new incarnation started utilizing electric guitar, tape decks, synthesizers and samplers. One was released on Sentrax and Subharmonic and was Final's first ever CD release. 2 (1996) and 3 (2006), which both compiled pieces recorded over several years, were collaborations with Broadrick's bass players: Godflesh's G. C. Green and Jesu's Diarmuid Dalton respectively. Two series of live improvised music were self released under the Final name on Avalanche Recordings, Infinite Guitar (2007-2009) and Guitar & Bass Improvisations (2007-2013).

I started doing a lot of stuff during the recording of that album where I was really trying to get past the limitations of Godflesh, which were self-created\".[Interview with Magnet magazine] After the album was released, G. C. Green left due to not wanting to tour any longer. Godflesh was booked for a European tour to open for Fear Factory, so Broadrick invited Paul Raven to replace Ben. A week into the tour Broadrick told \"Raven is a fantastic bass player, but it just wasn't Benny, who I had been playing with for 13 years and was a whole part of what Godflesh was\". A North American tour was also planned without Broadrick's input. Soon after, Broadrick and his girlfriend of thirteen years broke up. Broadrick slipped into a mental breakdown, fled back to Birmingham and hid at a friend's house just as he was supposed to board a plane to begin the North American tour. Bands, equipment companies and promoters moved to recoup the lost money and Broadrick lost his house and other valuable assets in his name.

Inspired by the dissonance of this music, the group recorded a demo called Extirpate (1986).

Broadrick elaborated upon their reception in a 2010 interview with Exclaim, saying, \"By the time we got there, the band had already grown beyond my expectations, it was already becoming a popular band in the underground, which we hadn't really expected. It was very much a surprise for us that people responded so positively to the music\".

After only six weeks with that band, Broadrick was fired for being, according to him, \"too noisy\" of a drummer. In April 1988, he and Fall of Because bassist G. C. Green reformed their project under the name Godflesh and set to work on a self-titled EP, which would be recorded in June and July of the same year at a studio in Birmingham; Broadrick and Green undertook production duties themselves. Crucially, it was in this reunion that Broadrick shifted from acoustic drums to vocals and guitar and that the percussion was instead programmed on an Alesis HR-16 drum machine. The decision to employ stiff, mechanical beats rather than a traditional human drummer would prove pivotal for Godflesh and industrial metal at large. About the title of the EP and of the band at large, Broadrick said, \"I heard someone once say that music is the voice of God. The word 'God' conjures something immense and inconceivable.
