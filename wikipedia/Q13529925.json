For example, Ian Hannah in The Story of Scotland in Stone (1934) found Adam to be \"a rather ordinary classical architect\".Hannah, p.306 Arthur T.

Dunbar found Adam's work \"as remarkable for its eclecticism as for its unevenness of quality\", and he went on to stress William Adam's \"robustness and directness\", and found these \"appropriate to the artistic climate of North Britain\". Gifford also stresses Adam's Scottish context, pointing out that Scotland was in many ways a foreign country during his working life, and indeed was a separate country to England until 1707. Adam should, he argues, be seen not as a provincial British architect, but as \"the architect of Scotland\".Gifford (1989), p.9"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ian Hannah"]}, {"page": "List of MPs for Wolverhampton", "response": ["*Ian Hannah (1935\u20131944)."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|Ian Hannah"]}, {"page": "Bilston (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Ian Hannah"]}, {"page": "Ian Campbell Hannah", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Hannah"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Ian Hannah"]}, {"page": "List of people from Chichester", "response": ["* Ian Hannah (1874\u20131944) - academic, writer,  politician"]}, {"page": "1944 Bilston by-election", "response": ["A by-election for the constituency of Bilston in the United Kingdom House of Commons was held on 20 September 1944, caused by the death of the incumbent Conservative MP Ian Hannah.
