After Eton, he went up to Clare College, Cambridge, winning his blue in 1923.  He played 136 first-class matches as a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium bowler for Cambridge University and Hampshire between 1920 and 1938. He was a good cricketer, but he will be remembered for his work at Lord's for sixty years. He was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1926, following the promotion of W. Findlay to Secretary. He continued to serve under Colonel Rait Kerr, until his eventual appointment as Secretary in 1952. He retired in 1962 and continued to serve the club as President (1968\u20131969), Trustee (1971\u20131983) and as a Life Vice-President (1983\u20131986).\nHe died at his home in Yapton, Sussex following a long illness aged 84.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 16", "response": ["*1986 \u2013 Ronnie Aird, English cricketer and administrator (b. 1902)"]}, {"page": "May 4", "response": ["*1902 \u2013 Ronnie Aird, English cricketer and administrator (d. 1986)"]}, {"page": "Bill Bowes", "response": ["With no apparent interest from Yorkshire at this stage, an approach was made to Warwickshire and they responded by offering Bowes a trial in April 1928. However, at the end of the 1927 season, MCC announced an intention to play against all first-class counties in 1928 and wanted to increase its professional ground staff, based at Lord's Cricket Ground. Bowes decided to apply and was invited to a trial in January 1928.Bowes, p. 17. At the trial, he bowled on \"a net pitch of matting laid on concrete\".Kilburn, pp. 78\u201479. Among the batsmen facing him were Pelham Warner and the MCC assistant secretary Ronnie Aird. Bowes made a distinct impression on them which resulted in his being offered an engagement on the Lord's ground staff for the 1928 season at \u00a35 a week.Bowes, p. 18."]}, {"page": "Billy Griffith", "response": ["He was appointed captain-secretary of Sussex in 1946. Although he relinquished the captaincy after one year, his wicket-keeping form earned him selection for the MCC tour of the West Indies in 1947\u201348. On his Test debut he was used as a makeshift opener as three senior batsmen were ill, and made 140 in six hours. It made him the only England player to make his maiden first-class century on his Test debut. He toured South Africa (under F.G. Mann) in 1948\u201349 and played in the final two Tests, the only wicket-keeper to be preferred to Godfrey Evans between 1946 and 1959 when he was available to play. On his return, he retired from playing cricket to take up an appointment as the cricket correspondent of The Sunday Times. After two years in this role, he was appointed by the MCC in 1952 as one of two assistant secretaries to Ronnie Aird at Lord's."]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire cricket captains", "response": ["*  Ronnie Aird 1931"]}, {"page": "Len Hutton as England captain", "response": ["Writing in Wisden, Norman Preston claimed that reservations about Hutton's captaincy led to \"behind the scenes moves to deprive Hutton of his highest ambition\u2014captaincy of M.C.C. in Australia.\" Hutton's appearances were limited in the 1954 season, missing several matches in the early part of the summer due to neuritis caused by the winter tour. He played in the drawn first Test, Pakistan's inaugural match, but scored a duck in his only innings. Suffering from mental exhaustion and physically unwell, Hutton subsequently missed a month of cricket on medical advice and the selectors appointed the amateur David Sheppard as England captain in his place.Howat, pp. 146\u201348. Speculation grew in the press that Hutton would surrender the captaincy and that Sheppard, a theology student at the time, was the favoured candidate of the selectors. Sheppard's main supporters were Walter Robins, a selector, and Errol Holmes, a former skipper of Surrey. They pressured Sheppard into putting his name forward to the M.C.C. secretary Ronnie Aird, while the press wanted to know his intentions.  He indicated that he could take a leave of absence from his studies if necessary.Gibson, pp. 186\u201387. Meanwhile, Hutton told the M.C.C. that he would go to Australia as captain or player if required. Sheppard captained England in the second and third Tests against Pakistan, winning both matches without particularly distinguishing himself.Howat, p. 148. The press supported Hutton, running stories about the prejudice against professionals among the M.C.C., but neither Hutton nor Sheppard publicly expressed an opinion. Robins, seeing the strength of opinion on the matter, backed down. As Hutton returned to cricket in July, scoring two centuries, he was appointed captain of the M.C.C. for the winter tour. Wisden claimed in 1955 that the selectors only chose Hutton by a margin of one vote. This was retracted the following year, when it reported the M.C.C. had informed them the vote was unanimous. Returning to captain a slightly weakened England side for the fourth and final Test, Hutton failed with the bat, as Pakistan recorded their first Test victory. In his three Test innings of the season, Hutton scored just 19 runs."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Ronnie Aird (1925)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Ronnie Aird (1927\u20131939) : R.
