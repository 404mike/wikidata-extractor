However, Australia responded when Glen Ella doubled-around Simon Poidevin and ran through a gap. Ella then flicked a scissors pass to Peter Lucas who out-sprinted Roger Baird to Public School Wanderers' try-line. In the final play before half-time, Michael Lynagh took a \"tap-kick\" near Australia's try-line. He passed to Glen Ella who in turn moved the ball back to Lynagh. Lynagh threw the ball to Simon Poidevin who ran down the sideline. Campese supported Poidevin on the outside, took a pass from him, and ran more than half the length of the field to score his seventh try of the tournament, to equal Peter Steven as the tournament's leading try-scorer. Lynagh converted Campese's try to give Australia a 12-6 half-time lead."]}, {"page": "Kelso RFC", "response": ["* Roger Baird"]}, {"page": "Allan Massie", "response": ["* Backline: Andy Irvine, Arthur Smith, Jim Renwick, Ken Scotland, Roger Baird;"]}, {"page": "1983 Five Nations Championship", "response": ["|LW ||11||Roger Baird", "|LW ||11||Roger Baird", "|LW ||11||Roger Baird", "|LW ||11||Roger Baird"]}, {"page": "1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand", "response": ["* Roger Baird (Kelso and Scotland), "]}, {"page": "Baird (surname)", "response": ["* Roger Baird (born 1960), Scottish rugby player"]}, {"page": "1984 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["SCOTLAND: Peter Dods, Peter Steven, Alexander Kennedy, Keith Robertson, Roger Baird, Douglas Wyllie, Roy Laidlaw (c), Alexander MacKenzie, Colin Deans, Iain Milne, Bill Cuthbertson, Alan Tomes, Jim Calder, John Beattie John Jeffrey.
