Francis Blomefield (23 July 1705 \u2013 16 January 1752), FSA, Rector of Fersfield in Norfolk, was an English antiquarian who wrote a county history of Norfolk: An Essay Towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk. It includes detailed accounts of the City of Norwich, the Borough of Thetford and all parishes in the southernmost Hundreds of Norfolk, but he died before completing it. This was done by a friend, Rev. Charles Parkin. The Norfolk historian Walter Rye related that although no portrait of him was known to exist, Blomefield closely resembled the astronomer John Flamsteed, whose portrait was used to depict Blomefield on the frontispiece of one of his volumes. His history of Norfolk was reissued in London in 11 volumes by William Miller in 1805\u20131810, the last seven being by Parkin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 16", "response": ["*1752 \u2013 Francis Blomefield, English historian and author (b. 1705)"]}, {"page": "July 23", "response": ["*1705 \u2013 Francis Blomefield, English historian and author (d. 1752)"]}, {"page": "1752", "response": ["* January 16 \u2013 Francis Blomefield, English topographer (b. 1705)"]}, {"page": "Norfolk", "response": ["* Francis Blomefield, Anglican rector, early topographical historian of Norfolk"]}, {"page": "1705", "response": ["* July 23 \u2013 Francis Blomefield, English antiquarian (d. 1752)"]}, {"page": "Julian of Norwich", "response": ["Julian's shorter work, now known as the Short Text, was probably written not long after her visions in May 1373.

The exact meaning of the name of the village is uncertain.  However, wella is a well, 'stream' or 'spring', and it is clear that there has always been water here with quite a number of wells still surviving, the water table being  or less. Baldhere is an Anglo-Saxon man's name, composed of Old English elements meaning 'bold, strong' and 'army', and may date back before the 7th century. In Norse it was a mythological son of the God Odin and in Swedish meant 'The God of Light'. The name of the village may thus stem from the Old English given name Baldhere and refers to a source of water belonging to or possibly discovered by him. Therefore, an original spelling may have been Baldhereswella.
