Martin", "response": ["He moved to the Pharmacia corporation between 1996\u20132003 and ran the Rapid Structure Characterization Group. When Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer, he served as the senior scientific consultant working on new methods development. He led the development of applications of unsymmetrical indirect covariance NMR, initially in an effort to eliminate artifacts and subsequently in the investigation of the mathematical combination of discretely-acquired 2D NMR data. The time savings for the latter was nearly a factor of 16 in time, with a 10-fold improvement in signal-to-noise ratios vs. directly acquiring an HSQC-TOCSY data set with the same sample. He conducted preliminary investigations into the utilization of indirect covariance NMR spectroscopy as an alternative means of evaluating NMR data for structure characterization and Computer-Assisted Structure Elucidation. He collaborated with a team of scientists at Advanced Chemistry Development, ACD/Labs, led by Antony John Williams, investigating the development of computational methods for automated structure verification and structure elucidation. He developed \u201caccordion-optimized\u201d long-range heteronuclear shift correlation methods to provide experimental access to small long-range heteronuclear couplings for the characterization of proton-\u201cdeficient\u201d molecular structures, to experimentally access 4J heteronuclear couplings, to differentiate two-bond from three-bond long-range couplings to protonated carbons, to measure long-range heteronuclear couplings and to provide a reliable means of observing long-range proton-nitrogen correlations without concern for the variability of long-range proton nitrogen coupling constants."]}, {"page": "Sean Ekins", "response": ["Ekins co-developed a Wiki with Antony John Williams called Science Mobile ApplicationsThe SciMobileApps Wiki launched 21 June 2011.Announcement of the SciMobileApps Wiki Initially this grew out of a desire to track chemistry Appshttp://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2010/May/MobileChemistryChemistryHandsFace.asp (for a paper submitted) and then Apps for science in the chemistry classroom."]}, {"page": "Draft talk:CompTox Chemicals Dashboard", "response": ["This draft is created by Antony John Williams and I have potential conflict of interest as I am the project lead for the Dashboard at the Environmental Protection Agency.
