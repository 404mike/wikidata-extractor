White was concerned that KNM-WT 40000 was far too distorted to obtain any accurate metrics for classification purposes, especially because the skull was splintered into over 1,100 pieces often measuring less than  across. Because such damage is rarely even seen, he argues that it cannot be reliably reconstructed. Because the skulls of modern ape species vary widely, he suggested further fossil discoveries in the region may prove the Lomekwi hominins to be a local variant of A. afarensis rather than a distinct genus or species. In response, anthropologist Fred Spoor and Meave and Louise Leakey produced much more detailed digital topographical scans of the KNM-WT 40000 maxilla in 2010, permitting the comparison of many more anatomical landmarks on the maxillae of all other early hominins, modern humans, chimps, and gorillas, in order to more accurately correct the distortion. The new reconstruction more convincingly verifies the distinctness of Kenyanthropus."]}, {"page": "Richard Leakey", "response": ["Richard shifted away from palaeontology in 1989, but his wife Meave Leakey and daughter Louise Leakey continue to conduct palaeontological research in Northern Kenya."]}, {"page": "List of Kenyans", "response": ["*Louise Leakey"]}, {"page": "Atlantic College", "response": ["*Louise Leakey (1972\u2013), palaeontologist"]}, {"page": "Meave Leakey", "response": ["Leakey was married to Richard Leakey, a palaeontologist.

Exploration and excavation continue under the auspices of the Koobi Fora Research Project (KFRP), which collaborates with a number of interested universities and individuals across the world.For more information, refer to the KFRP Journal site currently being maintained by Louise Leakey.
