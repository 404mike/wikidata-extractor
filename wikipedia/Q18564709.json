She moved from women's votes to peace and worked in Geneva supporting the League of Nations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Emmeline Pankhurst", "response": ["Shortly after the funeral, one of Pankhurst's bodyguards from her WSPU days, Catherine Marshall, began raising funds for a memorial statue. In spring 1930 her efforts bore fruit, and on 6 March her statue in Victoria Tower Gardens, next to and gesturing towards the Houses of Parliament, was unveiled. A crowd of radicals, former suffragettes, and national dignitaries gathered as former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin presented the memorial to the public. In his address, Baldwin declared: \"I say with no fear of contradiction, that whatever view posterity may take, Mrs. Pankhurst has won for herself a niche in the Temple of Fame which will last for all time.\"Quoted in Purvis 2002, p. 357. Sylvia was the only Pankhurst daughter in attendance; Christabel, touring North America, sent a telegram which was read aloud. While planning the agenda for the day, Marshall had intentionally excluded Sylvia, who in her opinion had hastened Pankhurst's death.Bartley, pp. 230\u2013231; Purvis 2002, pp. 355\u2013357; Pugh, pp. 409\u2013411. Pugh gives the date as 6 April, while Bartley and Purvis indicate March as the date of the statue's unveiling. Historic England listed the statue as Grade II on 5 February 1970."]}, {"page": "Fenner Brockway", "response": ["On 12 November 1914 he published an appeal for men and women of the military age to join him in forming the No-Conscription Fellowship to campaign against the possibility of the government attempting to introduce conscription in Britain. Brockway acknowledged his wife, Lila Brockway, had the foresight 'that those who intended to refuse military service should band themselves together'. Lila acted as provisional secretary at their cottage in Derbyshire until the beginning of 1915, when the membership had grown so large that it had become necessary to open an office in London. In London, Catherine Marshall became the Fellowship's political secretary since she was adept at political strategy as the Parliamentary Secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. The No-Conscription Fellowship produced a weekly newspaper The Tribunal that was suppressed; through the activity of Joan Beauchamp it continued production although her refusal to divulge the name of the printer caused her to be charged with contempt of court and held in custody for 10 days. The offices of the Labour Leader were raided in August 1915 and Brockway was charged with publishing seditious material. He pleaded not guilty and was acquitted in court. In 1916 Brockway was again arrested, this time for distributing anti-conscription leaflets. He was fined, and after refusing to pay the fine, was sent to Pentonville Prison for two months."]}, {"page": "Opposition to World War I", "response": ["The women's suffrage movement in Britain split on the war issue. The main official groups supported the war but it was opposed by a number of prominent women's rights campaigners, including Helena Swanwick, Margaret Ashton, Catherine Marshall, Maude Royden, Kathleen Courtney  Chrystal Macmillan, and Sylvia Pankhurst. It was an early coalition of women's campaigning with pacifism that led to the formation of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in 1915."]}, {"page": "Katherine Marshall", "response": ["*Catherine Marshall, American author", "*Catherine Marshall (suffragist), women's suffrage and peace campaigner"]}, {"page": "Catherine Marshall (suffragette)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Catherine Marshall (suffragist)"]}, {"page": "Catherine Elizabeth Marshall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Catherine Marshall (suffragist)"]}, {"page": "Margaret Aldersley", "response": ["In around 1910 Aldersley joined the Nelson & Clitheroe Suffrage Society alongside Mary Atkinson, Harriette Beanland, Cissy Foley, Clara Staton and Selina Cooper before becoming an organiser for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) in 1912 and a member of the executive committee.Jill Liddington and Jill Norris, History of Radical Suffragists: The Forgotten Fight of Workers in the North of England, Libertalia (2018) ()Sandra Burman, Fit Work for Women, Routledge, (2013) ( )Holton, pg. 81 When in 1912 the NUWSS established the Election Fighting Fund committee (EFF) headed by Catherine Marshall to collect funds and support the Labour Party Aldersley was among the local organisers.Smith, Harold L.
