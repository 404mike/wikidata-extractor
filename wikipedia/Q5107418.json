After the trade was finalized, he was assigned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox as one of multiple potential replacements for the veteran Jason Varitek. When Kevin Cash was placed on the disabled list with a hamstring injury on August 11, Saltalamacchia was called up to start behind the plate, with regular catcher V\u00edctor Mart\u00ednez filling in for Cash at first base. His stint was short-lived, as Saltalamacchia was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 19 after a sore leg turned out to be infected. He had only 13 at-bats after returning from the infection before going down with a torn ligament in his left thumb. The ligament required surgery and 4\u20136 weeks of recovery, and Saltalamacchia was shut down for the season on September 28, 2010. He appeared in only 10 games for the Red Sox that season, going 3-for-19 in the process, but manager Terry Francona said that he was \"kind of excited about\" the limited action that Saltalamacchia did see."]}, {"page": "2011 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship", "response": ["|Chris McGuinness"]}, {"page": "2013 All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship Final", "response": ["Antrim were sluggish after the restart with Kelly and O'Halloran scoring points for Clare inside the opening minute. Ciaran Clarke forced Clare goalkeeper Ronan Taaffe into a great save in the 35th minute, however, scores from O'Connell and O'Halloran handed Clare a 22-point lead in the 37th minute. Clarke, Chris McGuinness and Niall McKenna pegged back points for the Saffrons, while at the opposite end it could have been worse for the Ulster side but for the brilliance of Dixon who pulled off fine saves in the 46th and 56th minutes. Antrim worked hard late on with Clarke and substitute Michael Bradley taking scores, but it was too little too late as Clare powered to a 22-point win."]}]}}
