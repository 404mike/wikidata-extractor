He is voiced by Phil Cornwell and was created by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett.\nIn the Gorillaz universe, Murdoc was responsible for most of the conception and formation of the band, and he is angry that 2-D is the frontman. He was based on The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. As a Satanist, Murdoc's fictional biography is filled with references to Satanism, such as his birthday being on 6/6/66, and indicates that, to become a famous musician, Murdoc made a deal with the Devil\u2014leading him to change his middle name to Faust\u2014who provided Murdoc with his own bass guitar, El Diablo.In 2018, it was revealed that Murdoc was incarcerated and did not contribute to the band's sixth album The Now Now, instead, being replaced by the character Ace, the leader of The Gangreen Gang from Cartoon Network's 1998 animated series The Powerpuff Girls. He has since returned to the band as an active member and is the bass player in the band's latest project, Song Machine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gorillaz", "response": ["Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett, from London, England. The band primarily consists of four animated members: 2-D (vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). Their fictional universe is presented in music videos, interviews and short cartoons. Gorillaz' music often features collaborations with a wide range of featured artists, with Albarn as the only permanent musical contributor.", " In the fictional Gorillaz storyline, the band introduced Ace from Cartoon Network's animated series The Powerpuff Girls as a temporary bassist of the band during The Now Now album cycle, filling in for the imprisoned Murdoc Niccals. Explaining the crossover in an interview with the BBC, Albarn said \"We were massive fans of The Powerpuff Girls when they came out, the energy of that cartoon was really cool, and we kind of know the creator of it (Craig McCracken).

As a result, the band was left without a guitarist, which led them to run an advertisement in a newspaper in search of a new one. Later the same day, a FedEx crate arrived at Kong Studios, and a Japanese girl leaped out and began playing a very loud solo on her guitar. After shredding on her guitar, she spoke a single word to the trio; \"Noodle\", which would then become her nickname."]}, {"page": "2-D (character)", "response": ["While 2-D's singing voice is provided by Gorillaz co-creator Damon Albarn, his speaking voice is provided by actor and comedian Kevin Bishop. Albarn has claimed that 2-D's singing voice was developed from a vocal effect produced by equipment in his studio that he has said is \"not Auto-Tune, but it was an early form of synthetic voice\". Gorillaz engineer Stephen Sedgewick says of the effect, \"The main lo-fi telephone-like effect is the typical 2-D sound...I can't tell you what it is, but it's done with hardware. The plug-ins on the inserts are a Waves Renaissance De-esser and RVox, and the Waves Kramer PIE [compressor], which I use a lot on vocals.\" 2-D's main musical characteristic has been described by Albarn as being abstract and esoteric dystopian lyrics that are often recited through spoken word Sprechgesang. In contrast to his singing voice, 2-D's speaking voice is high-pitched and squeaky, and at one point he had a speech impediment and a strong lisp due to his missing teeth. Although he is from the West Sussex region of England, 2-D speaks in a mockney accent rather than a Sussex dialect. In his first spoken appearances on the press release interview CD \"The Apex Tapes\", 2-D's speaking voice was originally portrayed as being lower and softer than the high-pitched, wheezy speaking voice that the character later developed. In Gorillaz' first American press interview (an interview with Rolling Stone), Albarn and Hewlett attempted to provide the speaking voices of 2-D and bandmate Murdoc Niccals, as they had not yet chosen proper voice actors for the characters, but Albarn gave up and the act was dropped after three questions. After this, Nelson De Freitas was chosen as the speaking voice of 2-D. In 2017, De Freitas was replaced by actor and comedian Kevin Bishop, who was suggested by Harry Enfield after declining an offer to voice the character.", "At age 19, Stuart was hit in the face by Murdoc Niccals when he crashed his Vauxhall Astra into Uncle Norm's Organ Emporium in an attempt to raid the store of its musical equipment. This caused Stuart to receive hyphema in his left eye and put him into a coma. Murdoc was then arrested and sentenced to 30,000 hours of community service, as well as to care for the vegetablized Stuart for ten hours a week. Not long after, Murdoc injured Stuart again while pulling off 360 donuts to impress a small crowd of women. Stuart came crashing through the windshield of the car and fractured his other eye. After the incident, he woke up from his vegetative state and was given the nickname \"2-D\", which refers to the two dents in his head. He was then recruited by Murdoc and chosen to be the lead vocalist of a new band he was forming after his last band had broken up. Gorillaz call the day 2-D and Murdoc first crossed paths \"D-Day\"."]}, {"page": "Russel Hobbs", "response": ["Russel became a member of Gorillaz after being kidnapped by bassist Murdoc Niccals and taken away to the newly bought Kong Studios while working at a record store called Big Rick Black's Record Shop in Soho, London.

He then became a member of Gorillaz shortly thereafter, taking on the role of the band's drummer."]}]}}
