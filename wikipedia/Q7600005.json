Unwinese was a corrupted form of English in which many of the words were altered in playful and humorous ways, as in its description of Elvis Presley and his contemporaries as being \"wasp-waist and swivel-hippy\". Unwin claimed that the inspiration came from his mother, who once told him that on the way home she had \"falolloped (fallen) over\" and \"grazed her kneeclabbers\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Stanley Unwin (1911\u20132002)"]}, {"page": "Gibberish", "response": ["* Stanley Unwin (comedian)"]}, {"page": "List of British comedians", "response": ["*Stanley Unwin (1911\u20132002)"]}, {"page": "Eric Sykes", "response": ["In 1959, Sykes wrote and directed the one-off BBC special Gala Opening, with a cast that included 'Professor' Stanley Unwin and Hattie Jacques, and played a small supporting role in the Tommy Steele film Tommy the Toreador."]}, {"page": "Beyond Our Ken", "response": [":The first edition of Beyond Our Ken was broadcast on 1 July 1958.
