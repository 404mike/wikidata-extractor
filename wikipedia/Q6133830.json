His family emigrated in 1833, and (after his father's death en route) arrived in Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land (now Hobart in Tasmania) in 1834. Starting in 1840 he pioneered on the island's Forth River, first clearing heavy forest for farming. Visiting the Yarra River in 1852 during the Victoria gold rush, he perceived a market for lumber and undertook lumbering on the Forth. In 1879 he retired from farming.He published A History of Tasmania in 1884, and in 1891 Bush Life in Tasmania Fifty Years Ago, subtitled \n\nAn Account of Pioneer Work in Devon, the Natives, Murder of the First Settler, Bushrangers, Visit to J.P.

There were warnings about the increasing rarity of the emu. In 1826, a letter from Oyster Bay stated that \u2018they will soon be extinct\u2019. In 1831, a traveller reported that emus were rarely seen in the midlands, though they were numerous to the westward. A second letter in 1832 claimed that \u2018the Emu is now extinct from the midland region around Bothwell\u2019. That year dogs killed \u2018a beautiful specimen of the emu\u2019 at Oatlands. It weighed about 100 pounds (45\u00a0kg), and the skin was carefully stuffed. An article in the Hobart Town Courier in 1832 deplored the loss of the emu, comparing it to that of the dodo, 'and we mention it particularly upon the present occasion, in order to impress upon our local government the propriety of taking some steps to prevent similar annihilation of that apparently no less valuable bird our native Emu. It is now very rarely to be met with in the island.' The author suggested keeping a few pairs in an enclosed area. This plea for preservation was echoed by Ronald Campbell Gunn who in 1836 reflected on an unsuccessful attempt to entice Lieutenant-Governor Arthur to respond to the plight of the Tasmanian emu, pointing out that \u2018Emus are now extremely rare \u2013 and in a few years will be quite gone\u2019. James Fenton, who arrived in 1834, wrote that he never saw an emu, and only heard of one being seen near the Leven in 1839. He claimed that the emus had all disappeared from some \u2018unknown cause\u2019. There are many theories about what led to the extinction of the Tasmanian emu."]}, {"page": "Forth, Tasmania", "response": ["James Fenton, a young man of Irish descent came to the Forth estuary in 1839 in search of arable land.

The Chief Justice should not have been put into such a position, and in 1851, when the new partly elected legislative council was formed, the Chief Justice was no longer one of the government nominee members.

Robinson spoke of him as \"an exceeding willing and industrious young man\", who was \"stout and well made, of good temper, and performed his work equal to any white man\".
