In the League Cup the Bees drew a lucrative away tie against Manchester United in October 2005. 5,000 fans made the trip to Old Trafford to see Barnet lose 4\u20131, goalkeeper Ross Flitney being sent-off in the second minute. The 2006\u201307 season started poorly for Barnet, but a mid-season rally saw them finish the season in 14th place. A good run in the FA Cup also saw them reach the fourth round of that competition for the first time in their history, beating Championship side Colchester United 2\u20131 in the third round and Northampton Town 4\u20131 in the second round before losing 2\u20130 to Plymouth Argyle at home. 2007\u201308 saw another mid-table finish for Barnet; 12th with 60 points, and a second run to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup, where they lost 1\u20130 to Bristol Rovers, with Jason Puncheon missing a penalty for the Bees."]}, {"page": "Eastleigh F.C.", "response": ["*Goalkeeping Coach Ross Flitney", "|2014\u201315|| Ross Flitney"]}, {"page": "Ben May (footballer)", "response": ["Ahead of the 2012\u201313 season, May went on trial with League Two club Gillingham, training with the club for a number of weeks and playing in several pre-season friendlies. No transfer materialised, and May signed for Conference South club Dover Athletic on a free transfer on 8 August 2012. He made his competitive debut for Dover in a 2\u20132 away draw against Sutton United on 21 August 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute. May scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 away win at Eastleigh on 1 September2012. He went on to score in seven consecutive games running from September to November 2012, five of which in the league and a further two in the FA Cup, subsequently taking his goal tally for the season to eight. He scored four times in March 2013, meaning he had scored over 20 goals for the season, the first time May had reached this milestone in his career. Dover finished the season in third place, meaning they would play fourth placed Eastleigh in the two legged play-off semi-finals. May scored a dipping volley as Dover took a 3\u20131 lead in the first leg, controlling the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turning and hitting the ball from 25-yards past Ross Flitney in the Eastleigh goal. Dover progressed to the final, but lost 3\u20132 to Salisbury City after extra-time, with May playing in all three play-off matches. During his one season at Dover, May finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, scoring 24 times in 45 matches."]}, {"page": "Michael Poke", "response": ["On 29 January 2016, Poke returned to Eastleigh, this time joining on a permanent deal until the end of the 2015\u201316 campaign.
