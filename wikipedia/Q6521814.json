After the club moved up to the Southern League in 1946 his first team chances were limited, but he did manage 12 appearances in the 1948\u201349 season when the team won the Southern League championship. He remained on the books at Priestfield Stadium even after Gillingham gained election to The Football League in 1950, but played only eight League matches in three seasons before moving to non-league Whitstable Town as player-manager.  He eventually gave up playing in 1956. In 1967, he was appointed manager of another Kent-based non-league club, Maidstone United, but his spell in charge was short.", "link_mentions": []}}
