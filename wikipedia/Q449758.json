Gill and Moore would eventually have three daughters (Elizabeth, Petra, and Joanna) and foster a son, Gordian. After a short period in Battersea, the couple moved into 20 Black Lion Lane, Hammersmith in west London, near the (recently married) Johnstons' home on Hammersmith Terrace. A number of artists associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, including Emery Walker and May Morris were already based in the area, as were a number of printing presses, notably the Doves Press. Gill formed a business partnership with Lawrence Christie and recruited a number of staff, including the 14-year old Joseph Cribb, to work in his studio. Gill began giving lectures at the Central School and taught courses in monumental masonary and lettering for stone masons at the Paddington Institute. In 1905 he was elected to the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society and joined the Fabian Society the following year."]}, {"page": "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood", "response": ["* May Morris (embroiderer and designer)"]}, {"page": "Wightwick Manor", "response": ["The Manor has the work of 13 professional female artists on permanent public display, more than any other in the National Trust, including notable examples of works by Lizzie Siddal, Lucy Madox Brown, Marie Spartali Stillman, and May Morris.

Holme had become prosperous through a woollen business in Bradford before expanding into the Asian goods trade and by the 1880s he was employed as a buyer for the Liberty department store. Married to Clara Benton, they had three daughters and a son, who moved with him to the House. Holme admired Morris, and it was here in 1893 that he founded the arts magazine, The Studio, which gave importance to the Arts and Crafts movement. The earliest photographs of Red House date from the period in which it was occupied by Holme. He also contributed to the development of the building by encouraging visitors to scratch their signatures into the window panes on the screen dividing the entrance hall from the gallery with either a diamond ring or glass-scratching implement. He collected over one hundred signatures here, from family members, friends, and visitors. Notable names include those of May Morris and Georgina Burne-Jones on their visit in 1897, and the names of Japanese visitors who were in London to collect a battleship docked on the River Thames; among the latter was the future Japanese Prime Minister Sait\u014d Makoto. This would be a tradition continued by some of the later owners, with the latest engraving dating to 1952.", "They asserted that \"We realise that at the present time the public are interested in other and very different movements in architecture and industrial art.
