Matters improved in the 1999\u201300 season, with a finish of 9th, just three points off the play-offs. However, 2000\u201301 proved to be a dreadful season, and Saunders was sacked with the club adrift at the bottom of the table. He was replaced by Colin Lee, who improved results and gave the club a chance of survival. On 5 May 2001, the final game of the 2000\u201301 season saw United away to Barnet. Before the start of the game Barnet were bottom of the Third Division, one point behind Torquay. The Gulls needed to avoid defeat to keep their League status, Barnet needed to win. Thousands of fans were locked outside the tiny Underhill ground as United stormed to a 3\u20130 lead, with goals from Kevin Hill, Jason Rees, and David Graham. Barnet fought back to 3\u20132, but United held on for the win to condemn Barnet to the Football Conference."]}, {"page": "Tiverton Town F.C.", "response": ["*Jason Rees"]}, {"page": "Ottery St Mary A.F.C.", "response": ["*  Jason Rees"]}, {"page": "Mick O'Brien (footballer, born 1979)", "response": ["He joined Torquay United in August 1999 and later that month, on the opening day of the season, scored on his league debut against Shrewsbury Town at Gay Meadow. After a first season in and out of the starting line-up, but with some notable moments, including as a goal from a 30-yard free kick at Loftus Road in the FA Cup third round tie against Queens Park Rangers in December 1999, O'Brien fell out of favour with manager Wes Saunders. He was loaned to Conference side Southport in January 2001, returning in March with Torquay struggling at the foot of the Football League. With Saunders sacked, O'Brien returned to the first team squad under new manager Colin Lee, playing four times as a substitute before the end of the season. The last of these games, on the final day of the season, saw O'Brien come on early in the first half for Jason Rees as Torquay won 3\u20132 away to Barnet to avoid relegation and send Barnet down instead."]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Jason Rees"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Jason Rees"]}]}}
