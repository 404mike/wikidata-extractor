At each trial, Gardiner was prosecuted by Henry Fielding Dickens and defended by Ernest Wild. Both times the jury was unable to reach a verdict \u2013 it was said that at the first trial the jury was split eleven to one in favour of guilty, and the second eleven to one in favour of not guilty. (Since 1974, a single juror's dissent does not prevent the jury from returning a majority verdict, but at the time it did.) The prosecution then issued a writ of nolle prosequi.

The consequence of this is that Gardiner is one of the few people in English history to have been tried for murder and to have no verdict ever returned."]}, {"page": "List of places of worship in Lewes District", "response": ["|The settlement of Barcombe Cross developed north of the old village.
