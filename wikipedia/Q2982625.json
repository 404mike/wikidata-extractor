As with series one, finding suitable stories for adaptation remained a problem. On her annual visit to New York, Shubik placed an advertisement looking for stories in the Science Fiction Writers Association Bulletin. One author who answered the advertisement was Larry Eisenberg, whose stories The Fastest Draw and Too Many Cooks were commissioned. Two further adaptations, of E.M. Forster's \"The Machine Stops\" and Mordecai Roshwald's Level 7 (dramatised as \"Level Seven\"), were scripts that had been offered, without success, to film studios for some years. Another script, adapting Colin Kapp's Lambda 1, had been commissioned for series one but shelved, owing to technical considerations about how it could be realised. When special effects designer Jack Kine indicated that he had a solution to the technical challenges, the script was brought back into production for series two. Five further adaptations were commissioned: John Rankine's The World in Silence, Henry Kuttner's The Eye, Frederik Pohl's Tunnel Under the World and Isaac Asimov's \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\" and \"Reason\" (dramatised as \"The Prophet\").
