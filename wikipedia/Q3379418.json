The three progressed through the elimination rounds to reach the semi-finals, where a defeat to China sent them to contest the bronze medal match against France. After a thunderstorm postponed the match for 50 minutes, Folkard and her teammates shot below expectations and lost the twenty-four-arrow contest by two points. In a profile published in 2012, The Telegraph listed failing to win a medal in Beijing as her biggest sporting disappointment.", "At the 2007 World Archery Championships Folkard won bronze medal with Alison Williamson and Charlotte Burgess in the women's team recurve event, defeating Italy in the third-place match after a loss to South Korea in the semi-finals. Folkard fared less well two years later at the 2009 Championships, advancing no further than the second round in both her team and individual competitions. She would however win two further bronze medals in the late 2010s, finishing third in the mixed team recurve with Patrick Huston at the 2017 Championships in Mexico City and later in the women's team recurve at the 2019 Championships in 's-Hertogenbosch.", "Folkard achieved three medals at the Archery World Cup between 2007 and 2010. At the fourth stage of the 2007 World Cup in Dover she won gold in the women's recurve tournament with Alison Williamson and Charlotte Burgess, and in the 2008 edition combined with Williamson and Burgess to take gold in the Santo Domingo in April and bronze in Bo\u00e9 in June. With Edinburgh selected as the host for the final stage of the 2010 World Cup, Folkard was entered as a wildcard alongside other British athletes and won silver medal in the mixed team recurve competition with Simon Terry."]}, {"page": "Alison Williamson", "response": ["Williamson was announced to the British Olympic team for her fifth Olympics in June 2008. She was joined by Naomi Folkard and Charlotte Burgess in the women's individual and women's team events, the three having won gold medal at the 2008 Archery World Cup stage in the Dominican Republic earlier that year. In Beijing the three were successful in reaching the semi-finals of the women's team competition before a loss to China relegated them to the bronze medal match against France. Amid difficult weather conditions which postponed the match for 50 minutes, Williamson and her teammates performed below expectations and France emerged as the winners by two points over twenty-four arrows. Williamson was later eliminated from the women's individual event in a surprise defeat to Khatuna Lorig of the United States, who in their twelve-arrow encounter shot a score just two points shy of the Olympic record.", "Williamson has won two medals at the World Archery Championships. In 1999 she finished with a silver medal, later calling it her \"worst sporting moment\" in an interview with The Daily Telegraph in 2004 after shooting below her expectations. In 2007 she and teammates Naomi Folkard and Charlotte Burgess secured bronze medal in the women's team recurve tournament, defeating Italy in the third-place match. By reaching the semi-finals they guaranteed a full berth of three female archers for the British team at the 2008 Summer Olympics."]}, {"page": "List of archers", "response": ["* Charlotte Burgess"]}, {"page": "Archery at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification", "response": ["|  || align=center|3 || align=center|3 || align=center|6 || Laurence GodfreySimon TerryAlan Wills ||Alison WilliamsonCharlotte BurgessNaomi Folkard"]}, {"page": "Burgess (surname)", "response": ["* Charlotte Burgess (born 1987), British archer"]}, {"page": "2007 World Archery Championships", "response": ["|   Charlotte Burgess  Naomi Folkard  Alison Williamson"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Charlotte Burgess", "|align=left|Charlotte BurgessNaomi FolkardAlison Williamson"]}, {"page": "Archery at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual", "response": ["| 40 ||align=\"left\"| Charlotte Burgess ||align=left|  || 312 || 311 || 13 || 3 || 623"]}, {"page": "Guo Dan", "response": ["At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Guo finished her ranking round with a total of 636 points.
