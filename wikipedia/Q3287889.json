Cavell was born on 8 November 1911 in England into a Jewish family. He died in May 1989 in Paris.\nThe work of Marc Cavell is unique in the use of raw materials to create the illusion of movement by multiple sets of lights, transparency effects, and reflections.\nHaving been influenced by Paul C\u00e9zanne, Cavell explored post-cubism methods and experimented with various materials. In 1950, he discovered distinctive artistic possibilities in light and movement.", "link_mentions": {}}}
