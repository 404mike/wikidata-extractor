The case is notable as the foremost police detective of the era, Chief Inspector Robert Fabian, led the investigation into Walton's death. The chief suspect for the murder was the manager of The Firs, Alfred John Potter, for whom Walton was working on the day he died. However, there was insufficient evidence to convict Potter and the case is currently the oldest unsolved murder in the Warwickshire Constabulary records. The case has earned some notoriety in popular culture due to its supposed connection with the local belief in witchcraft.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Quinton, Warwickshire", "response": ["Lower Quinton was the site of the notorious murder in 1945 of Charles Walton, in what was believed by some to have been a witchcraft-related ritual killing.BBC page covering the 1945 murder"]}, {"page": "Mickleton, Gloucestershire", "response": ["Mickleton is noted for its market gardening and vegetable growing Young plants, seed plugs, apples, cauliflowers and asparagus, or gras, are grown locally.
