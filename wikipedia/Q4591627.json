The England team had not competed in the 1934 FIFA World Cup and were considered, in England, to be the real world champions. Seven of the eleven who played for England that day played for Arsenal. Jack Barker purportedly commented to Brook before the game 'You've got to take off your hats to these Arsenal players. If one of us were to drop out, another Arsenal man would step in'. In the match Brook and Bastin caused the Italians 'an infinite amount of trouble by their passing and quick shooting'. Brook missed a penalty early in the match but redeemed himself by scoring two goals to help England to a 3\u20132 victory. He scored his first goal by heading the ball past Carlo Ceresoli after a precise cross from Stanley Matthews, and his second from a free kick which Matthews described as being like a 'thunderbolt'. p67 Matthews remembered the game as the most violent in which he had been involved during his long career. Matthews stated that the behaviour of the Italians affected him, but that 'fortunately we had two real hard nuts in the England side that day in Eric Brook and Wilf Copping who started to dish out as good as they got and more'. Brook finished the first half with a shoulder injury while Ted Drake had two black eyes. According to Matthews, although Brook had been injured 'he continued to play manfully with his shoulder strapped up' One journalist stated that Brook was shamefully treated by the Italian players, who fouled him repeatedly, but that he had the self-control not to retaliate (at one point he raised a hand in anger but then dropped it). After the game, Brook 'returned to Manchester with his arm in a sling'. Brook is only one of four England players to have scored more than one goal in a game against Italy, the others being Mick Channon, Gerry Hitchens and Tom Finney."]}]}}
