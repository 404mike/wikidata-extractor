William St Clair joined OBP in 2009 and became the Chairman of the Board of Directors, a role he held until his death in 2021. OBP is now the biggest independent open access academic publisher of monographs in the UK. By the autumn of 2021, it had 230 books in its catalogue, all of which are free to read online. With print on demand technology OBP titles are also available in paperback and hardback editions. Some of their titles experiment with innovative formats, e.g. books drawn from online databases, such as A Lexicon of Medieval Nordic Law by Inger Larsson, Ulrika Dj\u00e4rv, Jeffrey Love, Christine Peel, and Erik Simensen (Cambridge: Open Book Publishers, 2020), or embedded audio or video content, such as Denis Diderot 'Rameau's Nephew' \u2013 'Le Neveu de Rameau': A Multi-Media Bilingual Edition, edited by Marianne Hobson, 2nd edition (Cambridge: Open Book Publishers, 2016), which incorporates musical pieces recorded for publication in the book into the body of the text. OBP organized a campaign to republish an out-of-print book by Ruth Finnegan through the crowd source funding platform Unglue.it. "]}]}}
