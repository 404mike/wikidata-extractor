Spooner then turned to an old friend, the television writer Richard Harris, to help him in creating a new venture, Man in a Suitcase. However, the more significant partnership Spooner initiated in 1967 was with Monty Berman, an ITC producer with whom he launched a production company called Scoton Productions. Between 1967 and 1971 Berman and Spooner created The Champions, Department S, its spin-off Jason King, and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). None of these programmes lasted more than two series, yet they all survived in the public memory long enough to justify video and DVD releases decades later. Indeed, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) was re-imagined by television producers in 2000 for a two-series run.
