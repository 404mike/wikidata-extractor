The competition was for speed.  An award called the Blue Riband has been tracked since 1838, for the fastest average speed of a steamship in regular service across the Atlantic.  This record became so critical to international prestige that the RMS Mauretania was commissioned by the British government specifically to take the Blue Riband back from the Germans and their SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, which it did in 1907.  The government also required it be convertible into a troop carrier if needed.  In 1935 shipping magnate Harold Hales formalized the prize by commissioning and donating the four-foot, solid silver Hales Trophy.

The contest was unofficial, involving no set rules or tangible award, and was undertaken for the prestige the accolade brought. In 1935 British businessman Harold Hales created the Hales Trophy. It passed to the owners of several express liners, though not to Cunard, owner of the record-breaking Queen Mary, and was won in 1952 by the American Lines liner United States. Thereafter the competition lapsed due to the rapid rise of transatlantic air travel, and United States herself was laid up in 1969."]}]}}
