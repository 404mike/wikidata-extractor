The contest was unofficial, involving no set rules or tangible award, and was undertaken for the prestige the accolade brought. In 1935 British businessman Harold Hales created the Hales Trophy. It passed to the owners of several express liners, though not to Cunard, owner of the record-breaking Queen Mary, and was won in 1952 by the American Lines liner United States. Thereafter the competition lapsed due to the rapid rise of transatlantic air travel, and United States herself was laid up in 1969."]}]}}
