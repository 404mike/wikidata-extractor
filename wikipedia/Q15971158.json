After the end of hostilities in Europe he spent time recuperating but was still not recovered when he was appointed as Director of Military Intelligence (DMI) in September 1945. Montgomery had become aware that he was to succeed Alan Brooke as Chief of the Imperial General Staff in June 1946 and told de Guingand he wanted him as his Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff. However, de Guingand failed to impress Brooke as DMI and as a result the job went to Frank Simpson. De Guingand retired from the army In February 1947 and emigrated to Southern Rhodesia to pursue a career in business, achieving considerable success.  He wrote four books about his experiences:  Operation Victory (1947), African Assignment (1953), Generals at War (1954),  and From Brass Hat to Bowler Hat (1979).", "Montgomery had sent a request to the new Commander-in-Chief Middle East, General Sir Harold Alexander, that several officers be sent out from the UK, including Brigadier Frank Simpson, who had served as his chief of staff in the 3rd Division during the Battle of France in 1940 and at V Corps and XII Corps in the UK. Montgomery informed de Guingand that he would be making changes, and that if de Guingand happened to one of them, he would attempt to secure him a good position. In the event, owing to the death of another officer, the War Office decided that Simpson could not be spared from his duties as Deputy Director of Military Operations and de Guingand was to serve as Montgomery's chief of staff for the rest of the war. Although common in other armies, the concept of a chief of staff was foreign to the British Army, where a staff was divided into separate general and administrative staff branches; at the Eighth Army headquarters the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) was Brigadier Sir Brian Robertson, with Lieutenant-Colonel Miles Graham as his deputy. Under the chief of staff system, one officer was responsible for operations and administration. This was the system that Montgomery strongly favoured and had served as chief of staff of the 47th (1/2nd London) Division during the Great War."]}, {"page": "Aide-de-camp general", "response": ["| General Sir Frank Simpson || 31 January 1951 || 31 January 1954 ||"]}, {"page": "Bishop Cotton Boys' School", "response": ["* General Sir Frank Simpson, former Chief of Army Staff, Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Commandant Royal College of Defence Studies", "response": ["*General Sir Frank Simpson GBE KCB DSO (1952)"]}, {"page": "Sidney Kirkman", "response": ["On 21 October 1930 Kirkman relinquished his appointment as staff captain with Malta Command and returned to England.
