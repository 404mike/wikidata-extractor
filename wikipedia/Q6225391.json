In the wake of this, Steel called for the SDP and Liberals to merge into a single party. At the grassroots, various local constituency groups had already de facto merged. In the SDP, Jenkins, Rodgers, Williams, and the MP Charles Kennedy supported the idea; Owen and the MPs Rosie Barnes and John Cartwright opposed it. The SDP's membership was balloted on the idea: after it produced 57.4% in favour of the merger, Owen resigned as leader, to be replaced by Bob Maclennan. A Liberal conference in September found delegates providing a landslide majority for the merger. Formal negotiations launched that month and in December it produced a draft constitution for the new party. In 1988, Liberal and SDP meetings both produced majorities for the merger; finally, the memberships of both parties were balloted and both produced support for unification. Those in both parties opposed to unification split to form their own breakaway groups."]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|John Cartwright, Lynda Chalker, Alistair Graham, Joan Ruddock"]}, {"page": "John Cameron Cartwright", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Cartwright (British politician) "]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|John Cartwright", "|John Cartwright", "|John Cartwright"]}, {"page": "John Cartwright (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Cartwright (British politician)"]}, {"page": "Social Democratic Party (UK)", "response": ["* John Cartwright (Woolwich East) - joined new party on its launch, 2 March 1981", "Most SDP members, including SDP MP and future Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, joined Maclennan in the merged party, but Owen created a continuing SDP, along with two other MPs, John Cartwright and Rosie Barnes.

It subsequently disbanded, although a third SDP was formed, which currently operates on a much less influential scale. There was also a continuing Liberal Party, led by Michael Meadowcroft and David Morrish, mainly based on Liverpool and West Country Liberals who feared a dilution by the former SDP members of the Liberal tradition within the merged party.
