Returning silver medalist Arthur Wint sprinted to the lead with Heinz Ulzheimer moving into a tight marking position with Gunnar Nielsen and G\u00fcnther Steines sprinting to keep up. On the home stretch for the first time, defending champion Mal Whitfield moved forward, past the other chasers into a marking position on Ulzheimer. Wint continued to lead down the backstretch, then Whitfield accelerated past Ulzheimer, who turned to look, then at the beginning of the turn, Wint. It was a deja vu for Wint, seeing Whitfield ahead of him on the final turn of the Olympics. The first five were separated from the rest of the pack, Whitfield pulling away to defend his championship. Wint couldn't make any progress on Whitfield but held off the battle behind him. Steines lost ground, getting passed by a big rush by Albert Webster, but Nielsen pressed Ulzheimer to the line, Ulzheimer taking bronze with a lean then in the next step doing a face plant to the track.", "| 2 ||align=left|Albert Webster||align=left|  || 1:55.5 || ", "| 3||align=left| Albert Webster||align=left|  || 1:50.1 || ", "| 5 ||align=left| Albert Webster ||align=left|  || 1:50.2 ||"]}, {"page": "Albert Webster", "response": ["Albert Webster can refer to:", "* Albert Webster (athlete) (1925-2010), Australian Olympic athlete", "* Albert Webster (rugby league) (1920-2014), British rugby player"]}]}}
