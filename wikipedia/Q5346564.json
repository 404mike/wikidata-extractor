He became the Imperial Mycologist in India and later the first director of the Imperial Bureau of Mycology in England. He was knighted in 1939. During his twenty years in India, he began large scale surveys on fungi and plant pathology and published the landmark book Fungi and Disease in Plants: An Introduction to the Diseases of Field and Plantation Crops, especially those of India and the East (1918) and has been called the Father of Mycology and Plant Pathology in India.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University College Cork", "response": ["In medicine, alumni include Sir Edwin John Butler, Charles Donovan, Sir Bertram Windle, Dr. Paul Whelton, and Dr. Pixie McKenna, doctor and TV presenter."]}, {"page": "Glomus aggregatum", "response": ["In 1939, Edwin John Butler described a Glomus aggregatum-like organism, but a name was not assigned to this species until 1943, when C.O.

Some Fossil Fungi from Minnesota. C. O. Rosendahl, Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club , Vol. 70, No. 2 (Mar., 1943), pp. 126-138 Over the course of the next 40 years, various researchers were able to isolate similar fungal spores (typically in areas with sand based soils), but it wasn't until 1982 that G. aggregatum was first described. N.C. Schenck and George S. Smith were the researchers who made this discovery (in Florida Citrus groves) and their description was very similar to that of R. butleri and other fungi in the Glomus fasciculatum complex, however, it was still thought to be a different species than R. butleri. Additional New and Unreported Species of Mycorrhizal Fungi (Endogonaceae) from Florida. N. C. Schenck and George S. Smith, Mycologia , Vol. 74, No. 1 (Jan. - Feb., 1982), pp. 77-92 Further research was conducted, and after comparing extensive amounts of fungal spores, a conclusion was reached that G. aggregatum and R. butleri are in-fact the same species of fungi. Analyses by Schwarzott, Walker, and Schu\u00dfler showed the genus was not monophyletic. The recent reorganization of the Glomeromycota phylogeny has renamed this species Rhizophagus aggregatum.
