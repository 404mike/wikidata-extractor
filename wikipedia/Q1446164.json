In 1983 Rutenberg began his studies at the College of Charleston, where he met and studied under abstract painter William Melton Halsey.

In 1986 Rutenberg listened for the first time to Glenn Gould's 1981 second recording of J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations, which launched the artist's deep and lasting interest in the late Canadian pianist's music and philosophy.
