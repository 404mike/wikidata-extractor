When his father died in 1933 the family returned to the United Kingdom and Green finished his education at Watford Grammar School.  He developed an interest in acting at Watford but when he left the school he returned to India and the Military Academy and was commissioned into the 2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles).At the end of the war he was demobilised and won a Sir Alexander Korda scholarship to Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). On leaving RADA he worked in the theatre in London. In 1953 he married the actress Margaret Tansley.
