Land Rover underpinnings were considered but was deemed too costly. The project did not progress to a drivable state and was cancelled in 2001 due to company cutbacks stemming from the Firestone and Ford tire incident.

Under the skin, only the base-equipment 5.4\u00a0L V8 and 4R100 transmission are shared. While sharing the similar aerodynamic cab design of its smaller counterpart, the exteriors of the Super Duty trucks are much different forward of the windshield. While an influence often compared to the 1994\u20132002 Dodge Ram, the Super Duty also derives elements of styling from much larger Ford trucks, including the Ford LTL-9000 and Aeromax, with a raised hoodline, large grille, and low fenders. A feature drawn from 1996 redesign of the Louisville/Aeromax was in the design of the side window openings; the front portion is lowered, allowing for increased side visibility (as well as larger sideview mirrors).  To improve aerodynamics over metal-framed mirrors, manual-telescoping trailer-tow mirrors were available as an option. As an industry first, two large, complete, ring-style front tow hooks were included.
