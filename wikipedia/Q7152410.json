His next goal enhanced his reputation further, as he scored a stunning volley in Chester's 2\u20132 derby draw with Wrexham on 25 November 2007. He went on to play regularly in the team for the remainder of the campaign, with several youth team contemporaries such as Paul McManus, Shaun Kelly and Glenn Rule joining him in the team.

On 25 May, Hearts were drawn in Group C, alongside Cove Rangers, Cowdenbeath, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Raith Rovers. On 18 July 2018, Hearts played Cove Rangers, which marked the first competitive match at Balmoral Stadium.  Olly Lee opened the scoring after 11 minutes, before fellow debutante Steven MacLean doubled the advantage in the second half. Cove pulled one back via Paul McManus with 15 minutes remaining, but were unable to equalise. During the 65th minute of the match Andrew Irving entered the field of play, replacing Olly Lee. Irving's contract extension had not been correctly lodged with the Scottish Football Association, rendering him ineligible to play as his registration expired on 9 June. An SPFL disciplinary hearing took place on Monday 23 July, as a result of which Hearts were deducted two points from the group stages and fined \u00a310,000, with \u00a38,000 of the fine suspended until the end of the next season."]}, {"page": "McManus, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul McManus"]}]}}
