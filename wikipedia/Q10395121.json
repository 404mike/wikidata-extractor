In November 1971 the club's manager John Prentice announced that he would resign at the end of that year; many outside observers assumed that McLean would become their manager. Instead he became manager of their local rivals Dundee United, where he replaced the retiring Jerry Kerr. McLean immediately started a co-ordinated youth policy which was to produce many fine young players over the two decades which followed; he had personally visited Ralph Milne, John Holt, and Davie Dodds to encourage them to sign for United rather than for Celtic, Aston Villa, and rivals Dundee respectively. In the short term, he used his knowledge of the Scottish scene to buy experienced players who would allow him to re-shape both the squad and the style of play in line with his approach to coaching."]}, {"page": "John Holt", "response": ["John Holt may refer to:", "* John Holt (publisher) (1721\u20131784), publisher and mayor of Williamsburg, Virginia", "* John Holt (Australian politician) (1929\u20132012), New South Wales politician", "* John Holt (American football) (1959\u20132013), American football cornerback", "* John Holt (Australian footballer) (born 1962), for North Melbourne", "* John Holt (basketball), American basketball player", "* John Holt (cricketer) (1923\u20131997), West Indian cricketer", "* John Holt (footballer, born 1956), Scottish footballer for Dundee United", "* John Holt (swimmer) (1922\u20131966), British swimmer", "* John Holt (15th-century judge) (died 1418), English judge", "* John Holt (English educator) (died 1504), educator of Henry VIII", "* John Holt (academic) (died 1631), Oxford college head", "* John Holt (Lord Chief Justice) (1642\u20131710), Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales", "* John Holt (composer) (1726\u20131753), London bell ringer", "* John Holt (Archdeacon of Salop) (died 1734), Anglican priest", "* John Holt (author) (1743\u20131801), English author", "* John Holt (businessman) (1841\u20131915), English shipping merchant", "* John Holt (educator) (1923\u20131985), American homeschooling pioneer", "* John Holt (singer) (1947\u20132014), Jamaican reggae singer", "* John Holt (veterinarian) (1931\u20132013), Australian veterinarian and Olympic shooter", "* John Holt & Co (Liverpool), a United Kingdom company", "* John Holt plc, Nigerian conglomerate"]}, {"page": "Paul Hegarty", "response": ["Hegarty returned to management in February 2015 when he was appointed manager of Montrose, then placed last in Scottish League Two.
