He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1924 to 1929, and from 1931 to 1945.\nAt the 1923 general election, he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Smethwick constituency, but at the 1924 election he was elected as MP for Nottingham East, defeating the Liberal Party MP Norman Birkett. At the 1929 election, he did not stand again in Nottingham (where Birkett regained the seat), but stood in Birkenhead East, where the sitting Conservative MP William Stott had stood down. However, he was defeated by the Liberal candidate, former MP Henry White.\nBrocklebank returned to the House of Commons at the 1931 general election, when he won the Liverpool Fairfield constituency. He held that seat until his defeat at the 1945 general election.\nHe was knighted in King George VI's 1937 Coronation Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett", "response": ["In 1924, the Campbell Case brought down the Labour minority government and forced a general election.Hyde (1965) p. 125. Birkett returned to Nottingham East to campaign for his re-election, though he faced a much more difficult job than he had in 1923. The Conservative candidate, Edmund Brocklebank, was much stronger than in the previous election, and the left-wing vote was split because he was also campaigning against Tom Mann, a noted Communist.Hyde (1965) p. 126. A few days before the election, the Zinoviev letter, allegedly addressed to the Communist Party, was published that mentioned organising uprisings in British colonies; fear of the \"socialist menace\" drove many voters to the right, and in the election on 29 October 1924, many Liberal members of parliament, including Birkett, lost their seats to Conservatives."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edmund Brocklebank"]}, {"page": "Nottingham East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edmund Brocklebank"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edmund Brocklebank"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Edmund Brocklebank"]}, {"page": "Liverpool Fairfield (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir Edmund Brocklebank", "*Conservative: Edmund Brocklebank"]}, {"page": "Clement Edmund Royds Brocklebank", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edmund Brocklebank"]}, {"page": "Sir Edmund Brocklebank", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edmund Brocklebank"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Edmund Brocklebank; MP for Nottingham East (1924\u20131929) and Liverpool Fairfield (1931\u20131945)"]}, {"page": "Brocklebank (surname)", "response": ["*Edmund Brocklebank (1882\u20131949), British politician"]}]}}
