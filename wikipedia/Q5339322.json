He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1924 to 1929, and from 1931 to 1945.\nAt the 1923 general election, he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Smethwick constituency, but at the 1924 election he was elected as MP for Nottingham East, defeating the Liberal Party MP Norman Birkett. At the 1929 election, he did not stand again in Nottingham (where Birkett regained the seat), but stood in Birkenhead East, where the sitting Conservative MP William Stott had stood down. However, he was defeated by the Liberal candidate, former MP Henry White.\nBrocklebank returned to the House of Commons at the 1931 general election, when he won the Liverpool Fairfield constituency. He held that seat until his defeat at the 1945 general election.\nHe was knighted in King George VI's 1937 Coronation Honours.", "link_mentions": {}}}
