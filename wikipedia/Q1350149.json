He started on an annual salary of \u00a3300, with an additional allowance of \u00a3200. To Allan, who described Hooker as a man with \"drive, enthusiasm and creative ability\", he was eminently suited for the post, being a professional botanist, an artist, a leader with connections to others in the botanical world, who was knowledgeable about plants from Britain and those collected from around the world.
