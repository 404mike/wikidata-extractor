The sketch 'Sex' was set in a Manchester library and starred Walters as a teenage girl who thinks she's pregnant asking Alison Fiske (as the librarian) advice. As almost the only comedy in the show, it came as a welcome relief to the audience and went down extremely well. During the writing process, Wood said she discovered her true voice. \"It was the first thing I'd written with proper jokes and I thought \"aha!\" I'd suddenly found something I could do. It was a blinding flash, like learning a new language.\" The Times said of the sketch that she was a \"great discovery\" who \"got more poetry out of Manchester speech than I had heard for years\"."]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier Award for Actress of the Year in a New Play", "response": ["| Alison Fiske"]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role", "response": ["| Alison Fiske"]}, {"page": "Michael Rudman", "response": ["* 2006: A Man for All Seasons, Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.
