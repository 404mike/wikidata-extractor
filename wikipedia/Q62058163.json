Her work was invaluable in recording the cultural and social practices of people in Cambridgeshire; she was innovative in the discipline of social history collection, employing working practices such as oral history, and engaging with people in areas that had previously been overlooked by folklorists. Her notebooks, now in possession of the Museum of Cambridge, hold a treasure-trove of information about Cambridgeshire customs, stories and songs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Murray", "response": ["Simpson noted that despite these critical reviews, within the field of British folkloristics, Murray's theories were permitted \"to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic\".

Local legend says that the dog was awaiting the return of its owner, who had drowned in the nearby River Great Ouse in the early 1800s. This haunting reportedly came to an end in 1906, when a local resident drove his car into something solid, which was never found, next to the spot where the dog's owner supposedly drowned."]}, {"page": "Museum of Cambridge", "response": ["Enid Porter, a leading authority on Cambridgeshire culture, history, customs and beliefs and a pioneer of oral history, was Curator of the Museum from 1947-1976.", "*Enid Porter"]}, {"page": "The Folklore Society", "response": ["* 1968 Alex Helm and Enid Porter"]}, {"page": "Arthur Randell", "response": ["Later he wrote a number of books which were edited by Enid Porter and published.
