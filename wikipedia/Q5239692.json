His speed off the mark and eye for a goal soon made him a favourite with the Boundary Park faithful, and his partnership with Jim Fryatt in the 1970\u201371 season, when he scored 23 goals and Fryatt scored 24, made a major contribution to the Oldham club's promotion from Division 4.\nHis continued success over the next two seasons led to what was then a big-money transfer in March 1973, when he moved to West Bromwich Albion for a fee of \u00a380,000. Playing at a higher level, he was not to achieve quite the same success as he had in the lower divisions, scoring 17 league goals in 65 starts for the Midlands club. He was already starting to suffer from niggling injuries towards the end of his time there, and in October 1975 he moved back to Oldham on a free transfer.\nHe maintained a more than reasonable strike rate on his return to the club, netting 21 goals in his 59 appearances over the next three years, but he was troubled by a knee injury for much of this time and was forced to retire in 1978.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Shaw", "response": ["*David Shaw (Australian footballer) (born 1938), Essendon premiership player and club president", "*David Shaw (footballer, born 1948), English striker", "*David Shaw (Canadian football) (born 1953), defensive back", "*David Shaw (ice hockey) (born 1964), Canadian defenceman", "*David Shaw (cricketer) (born 1967), English right-handed batsman and medium pace bowler", "*David Shaw (American football) (born 1972), wide receiver and Stanford Cardinal head coach", "*David Shaw (moderator) (1719\u20131810), Scottish minister", "*David Shaw (writer) (1943\u20132005), American journalist for Los Angeles Times", "*David Shaw (British politician) (born 1950), Conservative MP for Dover", "*David Shaw (painter) (1952\u20131989), English print-maker, lecturer and drawing tutor", "*David Shaw (British Army officer) (born 1957), British general", "*David Shaw, American frontman since 2007 for rock band The Revivalists"]}, {"page": "David Steele (footballer)", "response": ["He was working on the family's fruit farm when Bradford City tempted him back into football in July 1948.
