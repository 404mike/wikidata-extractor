He is best known, like his brother Alfred Harmsworth, later Viscount Northcliffe, for the development of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror. Rothermere was a pioneer of popular journalism.\nTwo of Rothermere's three sons were killed in action during the First World War and in the 1930s, he opposed the Second World War, advocated instead peaceful relations between Germany and the United Kingdom, and used his media influence to that end. His open support for fascism and praise for Nazism and the British Union of Fascists contributed to the popularity of those views in the 1930s. That ambition for which Rothermere became best known was not successful, and he died in Bermuda early in the war.", "link_mentions": {}}}
