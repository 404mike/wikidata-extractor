He was educated at the University of Edinburgh.He was assistant lecturer successively to Sir William Hamilton and Alexander Campbell Fraser (1856\u201360). In 1860 he was appointed to the chair of logic, metaphysics and rhetoric at the University of St Andrews, and in 1864 to the corresponding chair at the University of Glasgow.In St. Andrews, he lived at 8 Playfair Terrace.In Glasgow, he lectured to working men and women and between 1877 and 1883 put on courses for the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women.  He founded the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1892.
