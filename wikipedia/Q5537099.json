He became the club's first choice goalkeeper in the 1905\u201306 season, playing 35 league games to George Boote's three. Unusually for a goalkeeper he actually scored a goal, albeit a penalty, in a 1\u20130 win over Manchester United at the Athletic Ground on 24 March 1906. In the 1906\u201307 campaign, he played only 12 matches, as new signing Howard Matthews was preferred. Box returned to Stoke in July 1907, with Vale in the midst of financial meltdown."]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| George Boote"]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 Burslem Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| George Boote", "| November 1905 || GK ||  || George Boote || Silverdale Town || Free transfer || ", "| Summer 1906 || GK ||  || George Boote || Knutton Rovers || Released || "]}, {"page": "Boote", "response": ["* George Boote (1878\u20131930), English football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "Boote, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Boote"]}]}}
