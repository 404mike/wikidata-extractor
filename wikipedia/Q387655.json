They were the first act to have three singles enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. As of 2006, total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", has sold in excess of one million copies.

The band adopted a skinhead look as an attempt to gain publicity from what was a newsworthy youth fashion trend, but this also added an unwelcome association with football hooliganism. Noddy Holder and Don Powell were particularly tough-looking individuals already, and the skinhead look exacerbated the disturbing effect of having \"toughs\" in the band. In 1970, the band shortened their name to Slade and released a new single, a cover of \"Shape of Things to Come\" which, despite a performance on United Kingdom music show Top of the Pops, failed to chart.", "In the latter half of 1974, the possibility of making a film was being discussed.

Noddy Holder has cited the single as his favourite Slade song.", "In August 1978, Noddy Holder was reportedly involved in a brawl with a bouncer (Desmond Brothers) backstage at The Stoneleigh Club in Porthcawl, South Wales. The bouncer was later jailed for three months for instigating the attack on Holder, after he had told the club bouncers to stop hurting the kids in the crowd who were pushed up against the stage, during the show. Holder showed his mettle by performing the next night as planned, although he had a broken nose, at a club in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. The story of the attack would later be written into the 1981 single \"Knuckle Sandwich Nancy\", which Holder insisted would be released as a single. The band said in contemporary interviews that RCA and Chas Chandler objected to the single's release, so it came out on the Cheapskate label, rather than on RCA, the label that they were contracted to.", "In 1988, Slade released a cover of the Chris Montez song \"Let's Dance\"; a re-mix of the track from Crackers \u2013 The Christmas Party Album.
