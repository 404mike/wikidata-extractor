Other batsmen of his own age, such as Leonard Hutton, moved ahead of him in the Test pecking order, and he was at times not fully fit. He completed 1000 runs easily in both seasons and there were occasional innings of brilliance: at Wells in 1937, he made 141 in 150 minutes with nine sixes and 16 fours against Hampshire. In 1938, Wisden noted that he was, at times, more defensive than he had been previously, and in run-getting he was overshadowed by his opening partner, Frank Lee, who scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. For some matches in 1938, Gimblett batted at No 4, Bertie Buse opening with Lee."]}, {"page": "Buse", "response": ["* Bertie Buse (1910-1992), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Somerset were captained for the only time by educator Jack Meyer but the team did not learn anything and dropped seven places from fourth in 1946 to equal eleventh. Even so, they pulled off some surprises by defeating champions Middlesex twice and inflicting on third-placed Lancashire their only loss of the season. Somerset were let down by their batting with only Harold Gimblett reliable through the season. Michael Walford played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and Playfair called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\". The main bowler was veteran Arthur Wellard who was supported by all-rounders Bertie Buse and Johnny Lawrence, slow left armer Horace Hazell, captain Meyer and new pace bowler Maurice Tremlett. The veteran Wally Luckes kept wicket and claimed 55 championship victims.

His season was mixed with 7-66 against Leicestershire at Melton Mowbray and 8-25 against Hampshire at Portsmouth but overall took just 68 wickets for Somerset. His batting was also disappointing. Against the Indians at Taunton he and Bertie Buse took 5 wickets each and dismissed the Indians for 64, a match Somerset won by an innings."]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Bertie Buse 26"]}, {"page": "Cecil Buttle", "response": ["As head groundsman at Taunton from 1946, Buttle was also called on when there were problems with other cricket pitches in Somerset: in 1953, he was forced into emergency action after the newly-relaid pitch at the Recreation Ground, Bath produced a farcical one-day result on the first day of what was meant to be a three-match festival of three-day games\u00a0\u2013 the match, against Lancashire, was Bertie Buse's benefit match and was finished before six o'clock on the opening day. Buttle told Foot: \"I had to take drastic action, and I decided on plenty of liquid marl and cow manure. We used a watering can to spread it across the wicket. The problem was knowing how to camouflage what we'd done. Then I hit on the use of cut grass. I sprinkled it all over the top and gave it a good roll.\" The other matches in the Bath cricket festival were saved."]}, {"page": "Jim Redman (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1951, he played in all but the first of Somerset's County Championship matches \u2013 he appeared in 27 games \u2013 and was awarded his county cap. He took 50 wickets in all at the relatively high average of 33.76. After the third Championship match, Maurice Tremlett, who had taken eight wickets to that point, did not bowl again during the season, and Redman opened the bowling in every other game with Bertie Buse, also barely above medium pace; they were backed by the three spin bowlers, Ellis Robinson, Johnny Lawrence and Horace Hazell, and these five bowlers then took all of Somerset's wickets for Championship matches across the whole summer. Redman had limited numbers of successful days: against Nottinghamshire at Yeovil he took five wickets for 151 runs after Tremlett had withdrawn from the attack. But his best performance was a month later at Frome: in the Derbyshire first innings, bowling unchanged with Buse, Redman took seven wickets for 23 runs as Derbyshire were dismissed for just 52 in an hour and 45 minutes. This return, from what Wisden termed \"deadly swing bowling by Redman\", was the best of his first-class career. In addition to his bowling, Redman also batted usefully in the lower order in 1951, making 472 runs at an average of 13.88. His highest score of the season, and the highest of his career, was 45 against Essex at Brentwood.", "Redman played only three more times for Somerset as an amateur, all of them matches at the Bath cricket festival in 1953, and he bowled only 18 overs in these matches, taking just two further wickets. He did have a prominent role in one of the season's memorable matches, though: the game against Lancashire, designated as Bertie Buse's benefit match, was finished inside a single day on a terrible pitch. Somerset's two innings resulted in totals of 55 and 79, and the match lasted up till six o-clock on the first day only because of a second-innings last-wicket stand of 35 between Redman, who made an unbeaten 27 \u2013 the only other double-figure score in the match for Somerset was 14 by Harold Stephenson \u2013 and the 17-year-old Brian Langford. Redman took two wickets in this match but failed in the other two games at Bath, and did not play first-class cricket again."]}, {"page": "David Deshon", "response": ["As an officer in the regular army, his first-class cricket was very restricted. He made four appearances for Somerset, three of them in 1947 and a final one in 1953. His final match was Bertie Buse's infamous benefit match at Bath against Lancashire in 1953, when the entire match was completed in a single day; Deshon's contributions to the debacle were innings of 0 and 9. In all, he scored 82 first-class runs at an average of 11.71, with a highest score of 21. He appeared in non-first-class inter-services cricket, as well as playing for the Royal Artillery."]}, {"page": "Jack Conibere", "response": ["As a cricketer, Conibere played as an amateur, and was a left-arm fast-medium bowler and a lower-order right-handed batsman. He was given a trial for Somerset in four consecutive County Championship matches in mid-season in 1950, but achieved real success in only the first of them, the game against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, when he took four wickets for 66 runs in Warwickshire's first innings and, with Bertie Buse and Maurice Tremlett, had half the side out for 47 before a recovery led by Tom Dollery. He took two further wickets in Warwickshire's second innings, but in his three further matches he took only one more wicket, and after two weeks his first-class cricket career was over."]}, {"page": "John Harris (English cricketer)", "response": ["As a player, Harris was a lower-order left-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He made his debut for Somerset in May 1952 aged just 16 years and three months, the youngest cricketer ever to play for the county; he did not take a wicket in his first match but scored 18 out of a ninth wicket partnership of 48 with Bertie Buse. There were two further matches in 1953 before Harris disappeared from first-class cricket for three years on National Service. When his cricket career resumed with five matches in 1957, he made useful runs from the lower order, with a career-highest of 41 in the match against Worcestershire. But he still struggled for wickets in a Somerset side that, unlike the year of the debut, 1952, now had several options in fast and medium-paced bowling with the recruitment of Bill Alley, Ken Palmer, Bryan Lobb, Ken Biddulph and Geoff Lomax. He did not play at all in Somerset's successful season of 1958 but returned for seven games in 1959. These included his best bowling performance, three wickets for 29 runs against Worcestershire. But at the end of the season although his contract had a further year to go Harris retired due to an injury and a job offer as a coach with Framlingham College, Suffolk."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1948", "response": ["Other than Gimblett, only two Somerset batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the County Championship, Bertie Buse and Miles Coope, but both players did so at a significantly lower average. The team's bowling was led Horace Hazell, who claimed 92 wickets in the Championship. Maurice Tremlett, who had been highly praised for his performance on debut in 1947 continued to show promise, scoring over 1,000 first-class runs in all first-class matches and claiming 86 wickets, positioning himself as the county's leading all-rounder."]}, {"page": "John Currie (sportsman)", "response": ["In cricket, Currie was a right-handed middle- or lower-order batsman. In 1953, at the disastrous Bath cricket festival where the first match, Bertie Buse's benefit match, was over in a single day, he made his first-class debut in the third game, against Leicestershire, scoring 4 and 13 in another match of feeble batting that was over well inside two days. He retained his place for the next match, a non-first-class game against the Royal Air Force, but those were his only appearances for Somerset's first team, although he played for the second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship up to 1955. In both the 1956 and 1957 seasons, he was at Oxford University and he was tried for the cricket team in several matches, but with little success. His highest score was 38, made out of a total of 95 in the match against Yorkshire in 1957. He had dropped out of the Oxford side well before the University Match in both seasons and so did not win a cricket Blue to go with the rugby ones. After leaving Oxford, he played second eleven cricket for Gloucestershire for a couple of seasons."]}, {"page": "Victor Munden", "response": ["Munden did not sustain this batting form, however, and his highest score after 1952 was just 64, although he still on occasion contributed useful runs from the lower order. Instead, his bowling became more important. In a match in 1953 on the pitch at Bath where Bertie Buse's benefit match had ended in a single day just a week earlier he achieved both the best innings and match figures of his career, taking six for 33 in the second Somerset innings to follow four wickets for nine runs in the first innings: the figures of 10 for 42 were the only time he took 10 wickets in a match. By 1955, when he took 87 wickets in the season, he had supplanted the ageing Walsh as Leicestershire's main left-arm spin bowler. In this season, he was picked for end-of-season representative matches in the Scarborough cricket festival, including an appearance in the Players team where he was successful as a batsman."]}]}}
