He played as a striker in a career spanning twelve years, and made over 300 league appearances.\nAfter coming through the youth system at Yorkshire Amateur, Watson began his career in his native Yorkshire with Harrogate Town in 1987. After just a year he was signed by Halifax Town, then under the guidance of Billy Ayre.\nAfter two years at the Shay, Watson joined Swansea City in 1990 for \u00a340,000. With only a handful of games for the Swans to his name, he moved north the following year to Carlisle United. It was with the Cumbrians that he established his best goals average, scoring 22 times in 56 league appearances.\nIn 1993, Watson was signed for \u00a355,000 by Blackpool, where he was reunited with Billy Ayre. He was purchased with funds raised via the club's \"Buy A Player\" match, a scheme by which money from gate receipts was given to the manager for spending in the transfer market. (The match in question was Blackpool v. Rotherham United on 16 January 1993, which drew a crowd of 6,144.)Watson scored his first goals for Blackpool in a 3\u20133 draw with Preston North End in the West Lancashire derby. His haul of 20 League goals in the 1993\u201394 season remained a record for 27 years, until Jerry Yates equalled it in the 2020\u201321 campaign.In six years at Bloomfield Road, Watson formed a successful partnership with Tony Ellis and scored 43 goals in League 115 appearances.Gary Megson, who succeeded Sam Allardyce as Blackpool manager in 1996, decided Watson was surplus to requirements and sold him to Walsall for \u00a360,000. He brought his career to a close at Doncaster Rovers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank Lampard", "response": ["From this season Lampard took the number 18 squad number having previously held the number 26 spot. On the first day of the 1997\u201398 season, West Ham opened their fixtures with an away game against Barnsley who were playing in the top tier of English football for the first time in 110 years. Lampard came on as a 76th-minute substitute for Eyal Berkovic. Barely a minute later he scored what was the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win for The Hammers having received the ball from Michael Hughes and flicking it past Barnsley goalkeeper David Watson. The season also saw his first hat-trick. On 19 November 1997, West Ham played Walsall in a League Cup, fourth-round game. Lampard's three goals plus another from John Hartson were enough to beat Walsall who responded via a goal from Andy Watson. Lampard made 42 appearances for the 1997\u201398 season in all competitions scoring nine goals."]}, {"page": "Andy Preece", "response": ["Preece played in the forward line with the likes of Andy Watson, briefly, then Tony Ellis and James Quinn, and under Nigel Worthington in 1997\u201398 he was made captain for a period."]}, {"page": "Andy Watson", "response": ["Andy Watson may refer to:", "*Andy Watson (scientist), British scientist", "*Andy Watson (footballer, born 1959), Scottish footballer and coach", "*Andy Watson (footballer, born 1967), English footballer", "*Andy Watson (footballer, born 1978), English footballer", "*Andy Watson (mayor), mayor of Rangitikei in New Zealand", "*Andy Watson (Ontario politician), Canadian politician"]}, {"page": "Andy Watson (English footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Watson (footballer, born 1967)"]}, {"page": "Andy Watson (footballer born 1967)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Watson (footballer, born 1967)"]}, {"page": "Jerry Yates", "response": ["Yates ended the 2020\u201321 season as Blackpool's top scorer, with 23 goals. 20 of those came in the League, which is the joint-highest total scored by a Blackpool player since Andy Watson in 1993\u201394.\"The Preview Show: Play-Off Final Edition\" \u2013 Blackpool F.C.'s official YouTube, 28 May 2021"]}]}}
