By the mid-1850s Swiss mountaineers had ascended most of the peaks and were eagerly sought as mountain guides.

In the later years, the \"silver age of alpinism\", the focus was on mountain sports and climbing.

The first ascent of the Matterhorn was in 1865 from Zermatt by a party led by Edward Whymper; it ended when four of its seven members fell to their deaths on the descent. This disaster, later portrayed in several films, marked the end of the golden age of alpinism. The north face was not climbed until 1931 and is among the three biggest north faces of the Alps, known as \"The Trilogy\". The west face, which is the highest of the Matterhorn's four faces, was completely climbed only in 1962. It is estimated that over 500 alpinists have died on the Matterhorn, making it one of the deadliest peaks in the world.", "Since the eighteenth century, the Alps have attracted more and more people and fascinated generations of explorers and climbers.

He was an English artist and engraver who had been hired by a London publisher to make sketches of the mountains in the region of Zermatt. Although the unclimbed Matterhorn had a mixed reputation among British mountaineers, it fascinated Whymper. Whymper's first attempt was in August 1861, from the village of Breuil on the south side. In Ch\u00e2tillon he hired a Swiss guide, who remained anonymous in his accounts, and in Valtournanche he almost hired Jean-Antoine Carrel as well, but, disliking the looks of Carrel's uncle, he changed his mind. The Carrels decided to give Matterhorn a try by themselves again, and caught up with Whymper at nightfall. Whymper now had \"a strong inclination to engage the pair; but, finally, decided against it\" and the Carrels went alone to reach a new high on Matterhorn of  the next day.
