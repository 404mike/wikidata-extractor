Almost exclusively a bowler, his highest score in 36 innings was a mere 12. He later stood twice as an umpire: in Scotland's home matches against the Australians and South Africans in 1912.\nHaving already made a number of appearances for Surrey Second XI, Keene's first-class debut for the county came against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in June 1897: he took 3-61 in the first innings, his maiden victim being Walter Quaife. He also played against Sussex at the end of the summer, but despite playing more games for the Second XI in subsequent seasons, those two appearances in 1897 were the sum total of his first-class career for Surrey.\nKeene reappeared in county cricket in 1903, when he played 13 times for Worcestershire, and collected a season's best aggregate of 36 wickets at an average of 17.88. This included an outstanding performance against Leicestershire at Leicester, when he took 6-22 (his career best) in the first innings and 5-16 in the second; Worcestershire defeated their opponents by an innings and 110 runs. Earlier that summer he had bowled unchanged throughout Warwickshire's first innings with Ted Arnold: both men recorded figures of 5-44.\nHe played seven games in 1904, taking 6-81 against Gloucestershire at Bristol in August. The following year he turned out four more times, his best return again coming against Gloucestershire: the 5-24 he obtained at Gloucester in July. After that season, he was to play only one more first-class game, making a single appearance for Scotland, against the South Africans at Edinburgh in July 1907; his 17 wicketless overs went for 94.\nKeene was born in Southwark, London; he died at the age of 57 in Crichton, Midlothian, Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Southwark", "response": ["|John Keene"]}, {"page": "John Keene", "response": ["John Keene may refer to:", "* John Keene (cricketer) (18731931), English cricketer", "* John Keene (physicist) (19211991), English physicist", "* John Keene (writer) (born 1965), American writer, translator and professor of English and African American Studies"]}]}}
