It was also in 1971 that Frisbee and Smith parted ways because their theological differences had become too great. Smith discounted Pentecostalism, maintaining that love was the greatest manifestation of the Holy Spirit, while Frisbee was strongly involved in theology centering on spiritual gifts and New Testament occurrences.

Leaders in the movement were required to be addressed by titles 'brother' and 'sister', which had a side effect of distancing them socially even further from the ordinary members in the movement.

Weiner, as Maranatha's president, was considered the ministry's \"apostle,\" and was believed to receive direct revelations from God. Campus pastors supervised members' lives very closely.  Disobeying one's pastor, or \"shepherd,\" was considered tantamount to disobeying God.
