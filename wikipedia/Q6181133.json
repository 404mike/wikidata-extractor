This novel form of quantum control could also have applications in the developing fields of quantum information processing and quantum cryptography.\"  Of the developmental implications, \"This feat, the sharing around of quantum information in light-form and in not just one but two atom-forms, offers great encouragement to those who hope to develop quantum computers,\" said Jeremy Bloxham, dean of science in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Hau was awarded the George Ledlie Prize for this work, Harvard's Provost Steven Hyman noting \"her work is path-breaking. Her research blurs the boundaries between basic and applied science, draws on the talent and people of two Schools and several departments, and provides a literally glowing example of how taking daring intellectual risks leads to profound rewards.\""]}, {"page": "Chapman Medal", "response": ["| 2001 || Jeremy Bloxham || "]}, {"page": "James B.
