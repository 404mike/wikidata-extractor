While artists such as Stephanie Pui-Mun Law have produced genre illustrations for book covers and role-playing games, the works of Brian Froud, also known for a series of illustrated fairy books, have been adapted into several successful motion pictures including The Dark Crystal (1982) and Labyrinth (1986). The concept design work of Alan Lee and John Howe for The Lord of the Rings (film series)(2001-03) for which the former won an Oscar would change popular perceptions of the depiction of fairy cultures. The 2003 book, The Art of Faery, written by David Riche and mentored by Froud, contributed to the careers of twenty fairy artists of this revival movement, including Amy Brown, Myrea Pettit, Jasmine Becket-Griffith, Philippe Fernandez, James Browne, and Jessica Galbreth, many of whom went on to author individual art books. Depictions of fae have made their way into the popular culture in other ways as well, including clothing designs, ceramics, figurines, needlecraft, figurative art, quilting, many marketed through Hot Topic to an international market online. Part of the growth in popularity over the past three decades is due to the New Age Movement. Renaissance fairs and science fiction conventions have also developed modern fairy art as a genre of collectibles."]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"B\"", "response": ["*Jasmine Becket-Griffith, American artist on acrylic, canvas and wood"]}]}}
