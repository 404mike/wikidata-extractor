In Britain the history of political thought has been a particular focus since the late 1960s, and is especially associated with historians at Cambridge, such as  John Dunn and Quentin Skinner, who studied European political thought in historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of concepts such as the State and Freedom. Skinner is known for provocative, methodological essays that give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.Richter, Melvin. \u201cReconstructing the History of Political Languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe\u201d, History and Theory (1990): 38\u201370. online In the United States, intellectual history encompass different forms of intellectual production, not just the history of political ideas, and includes fields such as the history of historical thought, associated with Anthony Grafton (Princeton University) and J.G.A. Pocock (Johns Hopkins University). Formally established in 2010, the doctorate in History and Culture at Drew University is one of few graduate programs specializing in intellectual history, in the American and European contexts. Despite the pre-eminence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the Renaissance to the Age of Enlightenment), the intellectual history of the modern period also has been very productive on both shores of the Atlantic Ocean, e.g. The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America (2001), by Louis Menand and The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923\u201350 (1973), by Martin Jay.", "In 2016, the Routledge journal Global Intellectual History (ed.
