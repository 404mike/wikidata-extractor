France's screenplay introduced the character of \"Augstus Trevelyan\" and the GoldenEye EMP satellite, and consisted of an cold open of an Aston Martin car chase aboard a high-speed train. However, Barbara Broccoli was concerned France's screenplay was still too unstructured and brought in Jeffrey Caine to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits and rewrote Trevelyan closer to his iteration in the final film. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.", "Category:Films with screenplays by Jeffrey Caine"]}, {"page": "Inside I'm Dancing", "response": ["Category:Films with screenplays by Jeffrey Caine"]}, {"page": "The Constant Gardener (film)", "response": ["The Constant Gardener is a 2005 British-German drama thriller film directed by Fernando Meirelles.
