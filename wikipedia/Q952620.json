He played as a forward from 1999 to 2013. \nKabba began his career with Crystal Palace in 1999 but failed to make an impact at Selhurst Park and following loan spells with Southend United and Luton Town he joined Grimsby Town initially on a one-month loan in August 2002. His performances for Grimsby earned him a permanent switch to Sheffield United. He went on to earn promotion with United and would feature for the club in the Premier League whilst also being a key part of the Blades squad in several successful campaigns. He eventually moved on to Watford before a series of injury woes began to damage his career and after several short loans with Blackpool and Oldham Athletic he moved on to Brentford and Burton Albion before spending his final two seasons with Barnet.

And after scoring his third goal in eight games for the Seasiders, when he again struck in injury time, in the 92nd minute, to seal a 4\u20133 win over Watford at Vicarage Road, the club's manager Simon Grayson confirmed that he wanted to sign Gow permanently.

To be at a massive club like Derby County and on loan to a big club like Blackpool, I have to pinch myself sometimes.\".

During the 2002\u201303 season, Town manager Paul Groves had been dealt several blows by the loss of loanee Steve Kabba as well as injuries to other forwards such as Michael Boulding while Phil Jevons was loaned out for financial reasons, this in turn saw Groves forced to select inexperienced youngsters such as Mansaram and David Soames. Despite impressing in the final half of the season, Mansaram was powerless in helping Grimsby avoid relegation from the First Division, however by the end of the season his performances had meant he was now considered as a first team regular. During the summer months he drew interest from Sheffield Wednesday but no concrete offer came in and the young striker nicknamed 'Flash' due to his lightning pace up front, stayed on at Blundell Park. Paul Groves eventually lost his job in February 2004 and was replaced by Nicky Law who in turn chopped and changed the Grimsby squad meaning signings such as Isaiah Rankin meant that Mansaram by the end of that season had found himself only playing a cameo role within the first team. Following a second successive relegation the Grimsby board installed another new manager in Russell Slade, and Mansaram now out of contract was kept on at the club during pre-season on a trial basis but despite being initially told he wasn't going to be offered a new deal he eventually signed on a 6-month deal.

His last four years with Grimsby were hampered with injury, and he only made a cameo role in each season. He appeared in just three games in April in the 2001\u201302 season. On 17 August 2002, he collided badly with Derby County defender Danny Higginbotham and was knocked unconscious; this left Livingstone with a head injury that would see him out of action for a couple of months.
